A less visited temple, a little deeper in the jungle so as other authors have said (although not witnessed by ourselves), may be prone to officials trying to profiteer.The main features of this temple in my opinion and what make it worthy of note are the long, cool corridors with decorated lintels over imposing doors spanning towards all four points of the compass.Similar to Ta Phrom, it has ancient trees that have become inseperable from the temples fabric, entwined and reliant on each other for all eternity. Amongst some of the areas of collapse there's an impressive carving of Jayadevi, one of Jayavarman VI's sister-wives.Not to be missed."

However the temple is not the reason for my review.I want to alert travellers to the abuse and intimidation we were faced with at nearby restaurants. The restaurants were at the East entrance to Preah Khan and YOU SHOULD NOT USE THEM UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES.We sat down for lunch before visiting PK. We ordered 2 fantas and 2 fried rice explaining we were vegetarian. As we'd been temple trampling all morning I had quite an appetite and dug straight into mine. It wasn't too bad but as I was about to finish my plate my girlfriend unearthed a fried ant at the bottom of her plate. Totally revolted we both immediately dropped our cutlery.I took the plate to the lady who'd served it, explained and asked for the bill. She simply laughed and put the plate down on a nearby table, resuming her activity on her phone. I had intended to pay for my rice as I'd eaten a lot of it however as that was her attitude I asked how much the fantas were, gave her the 2 dollars and said I wouldn't pay for food with insects in. As the dishes were identical it was fair to assume my dish had also been contaminated so I wouldn't pay for that either. She immediately started screaming to a lady at a restaurant further along. It appears they are all one business. We got up and went to visit the temple. Once past the ticket check the lady who'd been called appeared behind screaming 'you pay, you pay.' I again explained my reasoning and walked away. She called after me that I was a bad person and I had 'lots of ants in my belly' confirming my suspicion about the contamination. On returning to our tuk tuk we were again chased by the same lady who assaulted my girlfriend by pushing her out of the way so she could stand in the way of our tuk tuk. Almost out of nowhere, she was joined by perhaps 8 or 10 other people, one of which was in a military-like uniform, all yelling 'you pay, you pay' at us. I again explained my reasoning for refusing to pay for contaminated food which was not only disgusting but had caused us to violate our beliefs and invited them to call the police to resolve the issue. Still, they wouldn't accept it and feeling threatened, we asked the poor tuk tuk driver who was caught in the middle of all this, to take us to our next temple. After the few minutes required to turn the tuk tuk around we departed to a torrent of abuse.Suspecting they may follow us to the next destination, it kind of soured what had been an otherwise wonderful day."

Day Pass checkpoint at the entrance. Walked about 150 metres of tall shady trees before crossing the bridge (lined up with 2 rows of the Guardians) divided by a stream. Ahead will be the ancient temple. Inside the temple, lots of trees and vegetations grew messily in this habitat ; will be walking through lots of uneven grounds, up and down steps, etc before arriving at the magical lamp in the heart of it. Was really exhausted after visiting 5 major temples. Conquering this 6th temple really drained off one energy completely. A pair of comfortable shoes needed. Feet was so sore after this walk."

The security guards do their job in a visitor-friendly manner, helping you find the best views, guiding you to hidden apsaras, taking pictures, showing you how to turn a hole in the ceiling above the central stupa into a flame in your hand.

It used to be the centre of a vast complex including a university and it seems much humbler now but very evocative. The four long corridors all lead to the centre with an elegant simplicity and to appreciate that (let alone photograph it) you really do need to get there when the corridors aren't blocked by other human beings toting cameras. There are a few well-preserved sculptures dotted about but the most astonishing things are the two trees that have run riot- one throttling a construction inside the temple wall, and the other slowly engulfing a section of the outside wall at the back."

However I decided against it as I just like to wander and soak up the atmosphere and if something catches my eye or I want to wander off in a particular direction I can just go. If you want to know about a particular building or carving you only need to wait a little while and someone will turn up with a guide and explain all about it.

This temple might not be as big or as famous as Angkor Wat or Ta Prohm, but I must admit that I enjoyed it more than its more prominent neighbors. There seemto be less visitors here. Therefore, the temple is surrounded by quiet and mysterious aura. I really enjoyed that special atmosphere. Moreover, the temple features trees growing on stones and walls. Thus, it's kind of similar to Ta Prohm - just less crowded. All in all, I highly recommend visiting Preah Khan during your stay in Angkor."

Visited the temple at around 3PM and I was not expecting grand from this because we originally planned to have a quick visit but we ended up staying for almost 2 hours This temple has trees like Ta Prohm which is comparable. The temple has human figures that resembles the guards. Some carvings on the walls and doors were quite well preserved. You'll see a linga (if I am not mistaken) at tte very middle of the temple. You might also notice that the area has lots of holes on the walls, as we were eves dropping with the Russians' guide , he said that there several glasses inside to reflect the light coming from the ceiling. Try to go around the nearby forested walls, it is also interesting how the trees are starting to devour the walls. Worth a visit."

Most of the structures were fallen and become rumbles, the temple is built beautifully with carvings and deities and women Apsaras dancing sculptures, The place is so calm and a on the main entrance side small vendors were selling souveniers , paintings, and tour guide books post cards. The temple is being restored by the Apsara authority. The garuda Sculptures are carved and installed on the surrounded fortified walls on the both sides of the entrance gate . Huge giant roots and tress were grown over the structure. Ther s also a Mahal of elephants a two storied structure with steps and a minar type structure on the right side of the temple.

This temple formed a series of archways, leading up to where the King would sit. As it was common practice to bow to the King, the height of each archway becomes progressively lower, as if to help with simulating the bowing gesture. It's unique formation distinguishes it from the rest and although it is not too far from Angkor Wat, it tends to be one of the quietest attractions, meaning you can explore at your own uninterrupted leisure."

Each entrance have several gates. The gates for peasants are from smaller to larger, so when you enter the first gate, you will need to bow down a bit toward to the center of the temple. While the entrance for the king or peasant, the gates is from very large to large. The first gate is very large and you can get inside easily (no need to bow down on the way to the center to the temple).- At the center of the temple, there is a stupa. The walls that surrounding the stupa has a hole, so that if you position your camera correctly, you will get a picture of candle-like stupa. - Beware of the security guard in this temple - he approached me and told a few history of this temple and asked for money in return. - There's a library (I forgot on which cardinal direction) - so that's why it is believed this temple is for scholars. - This temple is much quieter than other temples.

Preah Khan was one of the larger temples that I've visited and it was so interesting to see that there are many doors and the pathway is so long from each gate that meet at the centre. It is amazing to think that people from so long ago built this temple and today it is still so beautiful."

There are a couple of other-worldly trees, like in most temples of Angkor, but these trees were prehistoric. As in dinosauric.

This is a disputed area, so the first thing you will notice is many Cambodian Army personnel guarding the site. As unnerving as this might sound, the Army folks blend in pretty well with the scenery. And the scenery is amazing. Unlike the Buddhist temples around Siem Reap, Preah Khan was a Hindu temple to Shiva. It buzzes with energy, if you are into that kind of thing.

It had several passages, interesting carvings of apsara dancers and garudas, a linga (phallic symbol) which cannot be found in other temples, stone rubbles, and ruins of a 2-storey Roman-like structure (said to be a library).You would feel like Indiana Jones or Lara Croft as you explore the different sections of the temple. Not recommended for the physically challenged though, as it will require walking along uneven stones and some climbing. Banyan trees with their massive root systems claiming the structure can be seen. I spent around 2 hours exploring this gem amidst the forest (with fluttering butterflies and dragonflies and the sound of birds)."

We hit Angkor Wat on a Saturday, but went to Preah Khan on a Monday. We're not sure if it was the choice of day or the location, but there were very few tourists at Preah Khan when we got there. It's a magnificent temple, and is quite different from the ones we'd seen before. There is a long hall that you can see the end of (barely) and walk through at your leisure. It's another awesome experience at the Angkor National Park. By the way, we went to the park three times over the course of four days. We bought a three-day pass for $40 (the price of two days if you pay for them separately), and we had a week to use it. That was a very good idea - highly recommended!"

On our second visit to the temples at Angkor, Preah Khan was the first stop on our Angkor Grand Tour - a trip round 4 of the quieter temples in the complex. Although still busy on the morning of our visit, a Saturday morning in peak season, it was by far less crowded than Angkor Watt and Bayon looked when we hurried by in our tuktuk. This temple is equally as beautiful and grand as the more famous ones in the complex, and also has an interesting visitor's centre with some information about the conservation and restoration work which happens on site. The stone faces are equally as beautiful and ornate as those in the Bayon temple, so if you want to avoid the crowds, I'd recommend heading here. Continuing on the Grand Tour only takes another hour or so, as the remaining temples are small, but well worth it for another look at this ancient civilisation and some better photo opportunities with less tourists around."

It was erected on the site of an important military victory and its outer perimeter is guarded by 72 stone garudas (winged mythological creatures depicted throughout Southeast Asia).This temple was also covered with huge tree forest and you can still see the stumps hugging the structures in the squeezing grip.

TO take a walk round the Preah Khan temple site is to enjoy a special experience.Many of the larger sites are more famous, but Preah Khan has just that subtle extra touch of how it was centuries ago, just that fraction more feeling that you are exploring a site which has still only just been discovered.It has the ruins to inspire, the carvings to marvel at and the snaking invasion of trees and roots to draw comparison with Ta Prohm, but it also has something which leaves a lasting memory.This derives from sections which quite clearly are untouched by modern man as I found out when I explored the temple for myself.My very good guide piloted me carefully round all the main points of interest and some that few tourists ever get to see and it was while we were in one of the less explored parts which was almost deserted of tourists that I came across a hidden courtyard.This to me epitomised how it must have been years ago when the scale of all these ruins was first being appreciated.For a start, I didn\u2019t even know the courtyard was there. It was only betrayed by a single waving frond of grass, enough to make me curious enough to find out where it could grow because all around was stone.It took quite a bit of effort but I clambered up high enough to look over the wall in front of me and there revealed was the courtyard, heavily carpeted with grass which was growing on a tumbled mass of wall and roof masonry.The walls were beautifully carved and it was clear that no-one would see this hidden gem easily far less go down into it which was pretty much impossible because the lowest remaining wall masonry was at least a dozen feet high and it was much higher in parts.I felt like I\u2019d found a snapshot back down the centuries and it made a big impression on me.So did the rest of the site be it tumbles of stone, stunning carvings, the might of giant trees and the root systems or the impressiveness of restored sections. Even those sections closed off to the public because of their dangerous condition still had a forlorn allure of their own.The walk through the site from gate to gate included a meeting with one young woman, baby in arms, selling shawls. Never have I received such a delighted smile for the donation of a single dollar. Put life in perspective.Don\u2019t miss a tour of this special place because you\u2019ll leave with some special memories."

When you talk to the local in the tourism industry, the Angkor Temples are divided into 2 different circuit, the grand or big circuit and the small or inner circuit. With sufficient time to cover both circuits and few other outside these circuits, the visitor will be most rewarding. Preah Khan is the first temple in the big circuit. The size of the temple is large, most tuk tuk will drop the passengers at the west gate and pick them up at the east gate. The Lonely Planet recommended 2 hours to see the whole complex but an hour will give sufficient coverage without missing all the key sights. Much of the walking will be through various gates, doors and courts. There are interesting sights abound."

As such it readily absorbs tourists and we found it one of the least crowded and more relaxed places to visit. We were there about 3pm when it quite hot and maybe that suppressed the visiting numbers. The central corridor is amazing. It gives the impression of being like in an infinitely reflecting mirror. At the east side of the complex there is a massive tree that is similar to the one that everyone lines up to have their picture taken in front of at Ta prohm. Only for this one you don\u2019t need to line up and you can get right up to it (and on the back side of the building stick your head up a hole in it if you are so inclined! \u2013 see photo).

Even at the hottest time of day there are enough tunneled passages and shady courtyards that you can spend time here without collapsing from heatstroke. Allow a good chunk of time to explore - we actually went back another day after sprinting through at the end of a grand tour the first time. As with other temples, the earlier you show up, the fewer other people will be there with you. WARNING! Though some temples and sites have fairly clean and modern bathrooms quite close, the nearest restroom to Preah Khan is a full kilometer down a dusty road well outside the perimeter, so if there's any chance you might feel nature's call, stop off at one before going in!"

There is also good food and souvenir shopping nearby. I highly recommend visiting this place!"

Walking through the corridors it looks like you could be victim to a cave in of the stone ceilings, as they are just pieced together and somehow still intact, in most places anyway. Being lots less tourists here, helped you appreciate the experience even more, and ended up being my favourite. It had a lovely unkempt connection to nature which added to the experience. Highly recommend adding this one to your itinerary."

Lots to see and get lost in. We went by tuk tuk and bought a guide book, we seemed to miss the noisy tour groups which was nice. However we got bothered by an off duty policeman wanting to guide us around, we politely said no but he followed us. We had heard about this scam we saw him doing it later to another couple. He will charge you a lot in the end, just say no and walk away. Be prepared for fake guides that charge you, sellers calling you to buy things and book sellers. But that's at every popular attraction. Please don't give money to the children they are working for someone the money won't go to them and they will go out and do the same thing the next day.

A long, shady white sand path leads to the temple area, where the ruins of the temple are the last remains of a thriving city that was a center of learning.Plenty of wall sculpture tells the story of that period, the height of the Angkor empire, and plenty of photo opportunities present themselves.Most visitors walk straight through and out another shady path in the back to the shores of the baray (artificial water body). Tuk-tuk drivers usually drop you at the front gate and pick you up at the back, avoiding a turnaround hike.My visit today, my second, was helped by cloudy skies and a brief shower, but as at most of the Angkor temples it can be brutally hot, especially at midday.Tip: Take a couple bottles of water and buy a couple of cotton kramas (the ubiquitous Khmer scarf) -- the kramas are indispensable on a hot day in dealing with the sweat pouring off your head. Remember to bring your Angkor pass; you will be checked."

Note 3: Money is changed in USD, Cambodia uses the reil as change, like cents. Note4: snack stands and beverages available near Angkor Wat - restaurants too, and vendors line up near other temples. Prices slightly elevated but it's not ridiculous inflation."

Quieter than the main Angkor Wat temple complex but in many ways just as special. Unusual columns and facades which were interesting to see.Because there were fewer people and a number of shady its this was a good place to sit and soak up the atmosphere of the forest. Sounds of parrots and lots of dragonflies flying around the dappled shade. Lovely atmohere."

Our guide did a great job with our approach as we walked through the woods, alongside the moat and came in from the backside which was completely desolate and hidden. The walk through the woods and anticipation of what and when we'd see our destination added some surreality to the experience. And then to find it and have it all to ourself until we got closer to the front and main area. I enjoyed taking some photos of nature along the walk ahead of the temple. The temple itself seems more special than some of the others as it has not been as restored and can be seen with a lot more growth on it without the crowds seen at Ta Prohm. It is similar to Ta Prohm but better in my opinion due to it being smaller and less \"touristy\" but with the same awesome tree growth and feel of being one with the forest. I highly recommend a visit but ask specifically to approach from the back for a more unique experience. We left from the front and could tell that we wouldn't have walked away with the same memories and experience if we had approached it from the main entrance. It would have felt more like \"just another temple\"."

The made some offerings during the ceremony and it was interesting to watch.

What made my visit more special were the effort we made to get into the rubbles to see the carvings of the first and second queens of King Jayavarman VII, and the enounter I had with an 80 year old \"nun/fortune teller\" who seemed to live near one of the lingams in the temple.

However when we were there a police officer started talking to us and pointing out a few things. He seemed like he was actually just passionate about the temple. After a couple minutes of him talking to us he then asked for some money. Normally we would have just said no and walked away but because he was a cop we didnt know what to do so we handed over a couple dollars. He was then very rude and said it wasn't enough and he needed at least 5 dollars. Then he tried to ask for other currencies too. It was disappointing and soured our visit. Shortly after he had taken our money we saw him latching on to someone else."

It is hard to believe that 100,000 people lived in the area around this temple when it was built in the 12th century. The middle of the temple is interesting and there are a wealth of carvings throughout it. It is a shame that the Buddhas were removed from nearly all the carvings. If you look closely you can see a couple of the Buddha carvings being converted to Hindu gods. Our guide showed us some of the carvings. A lot of the outer temple is a jumble of rubble but the middle part has been restored.

Unlike Angkor Wat, Bayon and Ta Phrom, Preah Khan isn't as packed filled with tourists, and isn't disfigured with all the extensive restoration works started in the more well known sites.I was in Angkor in 2005, and Preah Khan feels like what it was like 10 years ago, for Ta Phrom untouched. Preah Khan will feel like you are discovering by yourself this architecture of man and nature bullt a millennial ago. It is a large temple comprised of many long corridors with openings to ruins, untouched.What's most pleasant about this temple is that it is a little off the beaten path, on the way to Bantea Srey. So it's not as touristy, when we got there mid-morning, there were only a couple dozen other people visiting it, so it never felt like we were fighting for discovering the place.The entrance is beautiful and especially the back of the entrance which feels like a jungle with ruins.Overall, the best temple I've visited in Angkor... This is what Ta Phrom should have been, but alas Ta Phrom has been ruined by the tourists, conservation works which completely removed the charm of the untouched ruin. I understand the need to preserve these landmarks but there can be ways to let them continue to live, as well as prevent too many tourists to go in at once."

What I love the most is the entrance, as it has some trees that gives you refuge from the sun. As you walk along the path, I left with the sense of missing the past on how it looked like before, and how great Khmer empire was though trampled with many challenges. Now, it still stands its ancient grandeur. A piece of greatness, we must be glad to have a little glimpse from the past."

Its a large temple complex in a jungle with amazing path to the temple with a bridge to the amazing wall. Inside the stone wall gate is a temple with great carvings, rooms, halls etc. Truely amazing.Our biggest mistake we didn't have a Tour guide to explain and show us what was not written in the book we had.My advice is please get a Tour guide or organise a tour as it is essential to understand the history to this amazing place. We used an excellent & best english (American accent) guide- Vannak (vannakguide@gmail.com), extremely knowledged.This tour was organised thru (the best) Odyssey Indochina Tours with a air conditioned car driver and guide- knowledge of history, language, customs and area including food.

There are a lot of great characteristic of Prah Khan:1. The pillars are line very straight. It seem that you are standing in the mirror.2. Good place to visit and to relax.3. For local people, Prah Khan is one of the sacred place. People always go there to give the offering to Prah Mae Indradevi and Prah Mae Jayarajadevi. They were the wives of King Jayavaraman VII. We respect him as Buddha as well. You can see his statue every where in Cambodia.Want to get away from a crowded temple, Prah Khan is the best!"

Now it is an excellent vantage point for viewing the east side of the temple.Close to the east gate, there is a mysterious two storey building, with very unusual round columns. We only can make guesses what aim did it served. Maybe it was a granary as some suggest it. Don\u2019t miss it!Hidden deep in the collapsing Preah Khan, there is Jayadevi, (pretty enough, but isn't my type) one of Jayavarman VII's two sister-wives. So, not only the Egyptian kings, but the Khmers practised incest as well.Preah Khan is a huge temple, so even if you think, that you have seen everything, be sure, you missed a lot."

When we first arrived, it was quieter, and then a couple of buses rolled up full of tour groups. Timing really is everything when visiting these old temples in Siem Reap. As always, wear sensible shoes. As another reviewer said, much is under renovation, there is only a partial area to go into, but I am glad we checked it out. Based on what we saw here, we went to another temple from the same era the next day. This may be personal preference, but I do not think you need a guide, especially at a small one like this.

I just sat there for 30 minutes, absolutely speechless from the beauty, just listening to the birds singing and feeling endless peace.Don't miss out on Preah Khan and go there!

However, when I stepped in it, I admit I was amazed by the abundance of shivalingams which symbolises shiva in Hinduism. They were everywhere but sadly in broken state. Nevertheless, there were 2 in good conditions. I would strongly recommend this temple to those who wish to ancient ruins of shiva temple. It goes without saying that Angkor Wat and East Mebon temples are equally and if not more breath taking. My trip was in December and due to the fact that it was a cooler season, every temple was packed with tourist. If you want to have a quiet moment to contemplate in the background of amazing temples, try Preah Ko. Very quiet in the morning. There was an old lady selling Cambodian scarfs, she sold me some scarfs for good price. I have no words to describe Angkor Wat. However, do visit the shops at the side of the Angkor Wat (within the complex). According to one shopkeeper, tourist does not venture into this area (perhaps duly instructed by their tour guides). You may be able to pick up a bargain because it is not frequented by tourist. Personally, I prefer to shop in temple areas rather than at Night Market. Night Market has very less variety for selection. But definitely good for food and drinks."

It's a great place and it took me about an hour to fully explore (even then I must have left out loads of details). It's amazing seeing how a portion of the temple is steeped in Buddhist traditions (bigger doors) and the other Hinduism (lingas everywhere). I felt that this temple had more details and gave a clearer idea as to how the temples could have possibly looked (there was more carvings that hadn't been as touched). It's worth your time to also look through these little gates where the rubbles are to understand how the Apsara are doing their restoration work."

Parts are well preserved and others are in complete ruin. Many intact Apsaras and even a completely out of place two story structure that appears to be of Greek design.

My sister and I visited beautiful Preah Khan on our bucket list trip to Cambodia and it is my absolute favourite temple in Siem Reap (yes, I loved it even more than Angkor Wat).From our fabulous guide I learnt that this amazing temple was built in 1191 by the wonderful Jayarvarman VII, who later built Angkor Wat, and it is dedicated to his father Dharanindravarman. It was originally home to 15,000 people and I've read that it was a centre for medicine and medical research where practitioners of Khmer, Chinese and Ayurvedic medicine joined together. It was incredibly progressive for it's time.The temple is entered by walking along the causeway across a moat, past the balustrades decorated with giants and Nagas. The complex is surrounded by high walls, and although many of them are crumbling there are some incredible carvings remaining. In particular, to the left of the entry towers is a beautiful Garuda, and there are many beautiful Apsaras and other carvings/reliefs to enjoy.From the very first glimpse of the entry towers I was enthralled. Preah Khan is crumbling, with many walls down and galleries ruined. But it is just beautiful. Preah Khan is so peaceful and calm and you can feel its history around you. I found that this place just touched my heart and my soul in a way I can't even describe. The history is palpable.The central temple contains two Srei Krup Leak, two special reliefs of Jarayajadevi and Indradevi who were the wives of Jayarvarman VII, the builder. These two reliefs hold a special place for many in Cambodia and people from across the country visit them to pray for fertility. We took a moment to visit here, and we were taught by our wonderful guide that we should always ask permission to approach special carvings/reliefs and statues by holding our hands in a prayer (or wai) position and ask silently for their blessing. Although I'm not religious, I think this is a beautiful way to pay homage to these incredible works of art and the long-departed artisans who created them.In the central part of the temple there is an old Buddhist Nun who spends her days there praying and giving blessings to all who visit. She speaks no English but I felt that I connected to her instantly. We took some time to sit with her and enjoyed finding out more about her through our wonderful guide. She spends her days there offering blessings to visitors and the donations given she uses to support monks in her small local temple. She gave us blessings, tied a small Buddhist blessing around our wrists, and touched my heart. It was one of those wonderful moments that find you when you travel, and stay in your memory forever.As you make your way around the complex, be sure to look around you as there are many beautiful things to see - views through doorways and windows, carvings hidden in shade, glimpses of the sky through damaged parts of the roof, and many, many carvings. Take your time to really wander around - you will not regret it.Things to remember when visiting:-* Be sure to book a private guide so you can move at your own pace. Make sure you get one that really knows their stuff as hearing the stories and legends around each temple was far more interesting than just hearing the facts. (If you need a guide then feel free to PM me - I'm more than happy to give you a recommendation!)* Wear sunblock and a hat. It is HOT.* Go early to avoid the majority of the tourist buses.* Be sure to take the time to just sit quietly and drink it all in. Bus loads of tourist will come along but they're gone soon enough so be patient. * Please remember to dress respectfully. Yes, you're on holiday and yes, it's hot but this is a temple.Enjoy! :)"

We were lucky enough to witness a monk and some worshipers praying here in a room off the main corridor. People were just walking around them and they didn't care. This also seemed (well, appeared) to be a more sacred temple too as there was quite a few police around - more than the others. I'm not sure what they were policing exactly but one looked to be guarding an cylindrical artefact in one of the rooms. Certainly go here if you can.

Though greeted by headless statues (ruined through the passage of time due to various causes, I guess) lining on both sides of the gate, I could not help being impressed by the long, long corridor (it could LITERALLY very well be about a kilometer from one end to the other!) inside this ancient palace building and also could not help imagining how awesome this corridor (and the rooms and areas it leads to on both sides which are now pretty much like heaps of rubble) must have looked in the time of the Jayarvarman kings who resided in this palace and also built the Angkor temples nearby during the heydays of the Khmer Empire.There's also a big bell about halfway along the corridor, and the bell has like a tall cone on top of it, and the wall above the doorway right behind the bell has two openings which can be \"aligned\" with the cone on the bell when you take a picture, and it will SURE look like a \"candle\" on the bell (my photo 3 as an example :) )!There's like a courtyard too on the left when you get to the end of the corridor with some of its own buildings and where you can relax a bit before walking back on the long corridor the same way you came in (I wished there was a way out at the end like at Ta Prohm and Banteay Kadei, but that wasn't the case with Preah Khan, only one way for both in and out).Preah Khan was the third stop on my Angkor circuit tour starting at Angkor Wat, then Angkor Thom, then Preah Khan, then Ta Keo, then Ta Prohom, then Banteay Kadei and Sras Srang reservoir, then Phnom Bakheng the temple on a mountain. If you're coming by minibus from Poipet, and if you see the tour operator named Vara when you get off in Siem Reap, I highly recommend his services - honest, timely pickups and no hidden charges except some small tip to your driver at day's end after the tour.Also, an important reminder is to have your ticket that you obtained at the main entrance (before getting to Angkor Wat) at all times during the tour since they check those tickets at each subsequent stop, not just at Angkor Wat."

Similar to Ta Promh, there are trees growing into the walls, on top of the roof, etc and given how much the rock walls are shifting, I don't think that people will be able to explore through all the walkways for many more years like you can today...at some point, it will become unsafe or they will rope it off or put scaffolding up.

Preah Khan is in ruins, no pun intended. The trees have uprooted much of the foundation making it broken in the most wonderful beautiful way. It's smaller than some of the other ruins and has a lot of long hallways with stupas and Buddha statues at many of the cross sections. It has beautiful views through every \"window\" you pass by.

We encountered a policeman (at least, he was dressed as one) who took some pictures for us and led us around to some sights.

As most others mentioned this is less touristy than many of the more famous temples and as a result has (thus far) avoided the deluge of tour buses offloading tourists by the dozen. There are many intricate doorways and passages to take photos of and they have not been extensively restored, preserving some of the mystique of the olden times. I especially enjoyed taking photos of the local priestesses on premise - the juxtaposition with the grey walls was something special. You can also get your fill of the \"overgrown trees\" photo opps without wrestling others like you have to at Ta Prohm."

Preah Khan (meaning \u2018Sacred Sword\u2019) is a sprawling monastic complex, that lends itself to the adventurous type of explorer, and if often compared to Ta Prohm. However, Preah Khan is much less touristy than its more famous cousin. Noted for its use of round columns, which is unusual from the Angkor Empire, it is full of passages and little nooks and crannies to explore within the jungle, with many ample photo opportunities along the way. Originally, Preah Khan was a Buddhist monastery, but during the reconstruction of Angkor Thom, King Jayavarman VII also used it as his place of residence. Interestingly, the King dedicated Preah Khan to his father, and the architecturally-similar Ta Prohm to his mother. Many of Preah Khan\u2019s Buddhist representations were destroyed by Hindu invaders in later years, and as such Bodhisattvas are now carved over the original images of Buddha in the stone. I was surprised at how much I enjoyed it here at Preah Khan, but it takes much longer to get here from Siem Reap downtown, than say Ta Prohm."

A Buddhist temple constructed late 12 th century by King Jayavarman v11. It is full of carvings and some fantastic photos to be shot. Trees have anchored themselves on several structure that lend to some fascinating photos. Wear sensible shoes and take a spare camera battery with you as you will probably need it, the grounds are uneven and there are steps to be climbed. Please don't touch the carvings as the sweat and acid from your hands will only deteriorate the sand stone and with the volume of people that pass though these structures, they must be preserved for the Cambodian people's heritage. I personally totally loved the whole Angkor experience and recommend that a visit is a must if in Seim Reap. This is not an attraction for wheel chair bound guests as the ground is uneven and there are too many steps to be negotiated."

This temple was probably the least busy temple we visited during our entire stay. It is huge though and takes a long time to walk through. I would recommend a guide to tell you about the temple and its history as it will increase your experience. Just remember that it is dry, hot and dusty. We opted for a 3 day pass and did 2 temples a day on two different days and stayed for about 2 hours at each temple. Don't forget to bring plenty of water and protection against the sun."

I found only one seller at the back of the ruins and we were left to ourselves the whole time to wander around. Perhaps purchase a proper guide book (this goes for all the temples!) but we did bump into a local who told us some fascinating history about the site and the urns held inside.

Unlike Angkor Wat, there's no upward climb, as there is really no elevated central temple, making Preah Khan easier to navigate. But beware - one can easily get lost in all of those eerie, narrow hallways!I entered Preah Khan through the East Gate - the historical entrance. After a few corridors was a courtyard, to the right of which is the curious \"Grecian-style\" two-story building noted in Lonely Planet's \"Cambodia\". The unique style of this building - utilizing round, rather than square, columns and with two stories, makes it easily the most interesting part of Preah Khan. Iti is even, for me, the main attraction.My guide Mr. Sophan then led me to the central Prasat, with it's holed roof. There were holes in the wall, allegedly once full of gemstones. A few more turns and we ended up in a small chamber with a statue of the King's mother, here venerated as a goddess who grants wishes. Mr. Sophan said that even high-ranking politicians come here to pray. The small chamber was filled with incense smoke wafting upwards, and the shaft of light to the left made for a spiritual, surreal image. The carvings are exquisite, though parts of the temple have fallen into ruin and are impassable. Preah Khan is best explored with a guide as it is very easy to get lost - on my return trip three days later I did get lost and had to ask random tour guides for a way out.Highly recommended!"

It doesn't have iconic views like others (except maybe the odd building with round columns) and it is a lot of fun to explore. The corridors are small and open into tiny courtyards where you can escape the crowds and discover carvings, statues, views through windows... and that's just the main building. There are several!It also features a huge tree encroaching the East outer wall, like its famous cousin Ta Prohm.Go early in the morning around 7 and you'll be able to enjoy it without almost anybody, especially the huge tree on the East side and the Hall of Dancers. It was also good in the afternoon around 4:30."

It is just far enough away from the center of town that it is much less heavily traveled than many of the temples closer in. There is much to explore -- I would plan on at least 2 hours if you want to see it all properly.

Don't feel you have to see them all. Three full days of touring are important to do this world-class venue justice but these are the Don't Miss sites, in this order of priority: Angkor Wat, of course, the stellar, Number One site; Bayon; Terrace of the Elephants and Terrace of the Leper King; Ta Prohm; Bandrey Srei; Preah Kahn; Pre Rup; Neak Prean.Give yourself time to visit your three favorites a second time within your three day itinerary. Many are so overwhelming in their interest, architecture, and artistry that you must see them at least twice to begin to appreciate them. We had to see the Churning of the River of Milk at Angkor Wat three times, as it was so artistically stunning, and is comparable to the greatest carvings anywhere in the World."

Also unlike most of the architecture of that time, the pillars of this structure are round unlike the sharp square cornered pillars you see...which in Khmer culture was avoided as they thought that round pilars would attract and house spirits.

It is not as well preserved (or restored) as the more important temples but it's scale and setting and the variety of rooms and corridors make this a very rewarding temple to explore.It's layout is founded on four long unobstructed corridors orientated east, west, north and south which you can look down and photograph making for an interesting perspective. There are some interesting inscriptions on the walls and pillars particularly in the hall of dancers. Unfortunately many of the ceilings and walls have collapsed lending a rather dilapidated air to the place. Like Ta Phrom, the are several instances of giant trees destroying parts of the building make for spectacular photo opportunities.I also experienced the unrequested attentions of the tour guide as mentioned by other Trip Advisor reviewers although I manage to get away with 'only' paying $3 despite his request for $10. He was rather knowledgable, however, and was able to answer a range of questions that had built up over a number of temple visits. If you are approached by some one who begins talking about the temple right from the beginning be very clear that his attention is not appreciated if you don't want to find yourself in a situation at the end where he obligates you to pay for his time.All in all I really enjoyed the temple and would put it in the bracket of the most unexpected experience of my Siem Reap stay."

We came across a local man dressed in uniform who was in the temple; he showed and explained to us a big \"candle lamp\" look alike thing when taken with your camera at a certain angle combined with a hole on the wall; creates a lit candle. Picturesque indeed. He kept offering to hold my camera and help me take pictures but because we're well aware of scams; we just kindly denied his offer. Just to be cautious.

It is a wonderful place to explore with surprises around many corners that make you feel like an explorer finding an undiscovered temple. Some of the complex is in ruins, some is restored, some has large trees growing through the stonework (a la Ta Phrom).There is a long walkway through a forested area to get to the entrance and you can continue to walk through a covered gallery right through to the other side, or explore various side corridors which can lead to some beautiful statues and carvings. There is also a wonderful 2 storey library at the side, which it looks like a columned building from ancient Rome. It is also lovely to find a quiet spot to sit and listen to the sounds of the jungle. This is easy to do as the temple does not appear to be on the intineraries of tour groups (I suspect it would lake them too long to get through it). A Highly recommended experience."

Walk through and come out the other side and walk onto the southern gate where hopefully, if you had a smart tuk-tuk man, your ride will be there to pick you up.Like Angkor Wat, Angkor Thom and Ta Prohm, Preah Khan is so much more than the temple itself.

If I only had 1 day, I'd skip the long circuit and do instead the shorts circuit, which has my top 3 on it---Bayon, Ta Prohm, Angkor Wat. If you love temples and can't get enough after doing the short circuit (and the sun hasn't fried you by that point), then do the long circuit and spend most of your time here at Preah Khan, the best of the long circuit. It is extensive, with many components to it.Long circuit tuk-tuk fare: $10-15 for the day.You can also rent bikes, but don't do it in March-April, as the heat is murderous."

There is also a very good visitor centre here with lots of information, plus before and after photos of the ongoing reconstruction.This complex was built as a monastery and centre for learning by King Jayavarman VII. For a short time it was also the residence of the King while his permanent residence was being reconstructed.  Preah Khan means \"Sacred Sword\" and this has a long tradition in Khmer history as Preah Khan was built on a former battle site where King Jayavarman defeated the Chams. Huge trees have played a major part in the destruction of this complex and also play a part in supporting some of the structures. Thousands of Buddha images were defaced here during the centuries by trying to transform the Buddhist complex into a Hindu temple. Phrea Khan is beautiful and one of my favorites, there is lots to explore here so allow yourself 2 hours."

This was actually a wonderful thing because while the masses are building at places like Angkor Wat (my least favorite temple) or at Ta Promh, you can enjoy a little free space at Preah Khan. It has the spectacular places to get that photo with overgrown trees growing from the ruins that every traveller wants. Plus, this location does not rope off the tree areas unlike in Ta Promh. You are less likely to have hundreds of tourists in your photos too. There are multiple entry points so do try to get your bearings when you enter the temple so you can find your driver afterwards. If possible, get their cell number in case you can't find them. The rubble, trees, and enclosed passages make this place absolutely stunning and worth a visit. Bonus points for having many covered spots for some much needed reprieve from the blistering Cambodian sun."

Preah Kahn was the temple experience I was expecting at Angkor and ta prohm but didn't find.. It is amazing to be able to walk around the crumbling ruins with no scaffolding or tourists! You really feel like your in the middle of nowhere. Such an untouched beauty surely won't last for long so make sure you see it to experience the real ruins. Word of warning, due to all the crumbled rock everywhere there is a lot of stepping up and down on uneven surfaces. I wouldn't recommend anyone who has difficulty ambulating venture far into these ruins.. Your better off sticking to Bayon and the likes where it is more accommodating. Preach Kahn is for the adventurous type who want to walk amongst the untouched Angkor ruins."

It is the last temple built by Jayavarma VII.It is quite a long walk from the front gate where you are dropped to the temple. There are suggestions that your driver can drop you off at one gate and pick you up at another. You walk up a long drawbridge like area lined with warrriors. Once at the front gate there is another walk ahead.It is however a very clean walk and shaded by trees. You will also pass a group of musicians. Please give them a donation. You will note that they are all land mine victims. Imagine yourself without limbs and facing the sort of life they are. Be generous. A decision has been made not to restore Preah Khan but to stabilise it. It is a delight to walk through. Some parts can be dark but is it clean - unlike Indian monuments there is no smell of urine or red sputum covering the walls and crannies. You do need to watch your step among the rubble and so obey the signs that say do not enter certain parts - they are there for good reason. Any displacement of the rubble could be dangerous both for yourself and the monument.There are beautiful carvings and a small \"Grecian\" temple. You will note that there are holes all over the walls. These, unlike many of the other temples are not bullet holes made by the Khmer Rouge in their target practice but holes that secured brass panels over the walls. You can just imagine the sheen and glow of these from candles and sunlight.Like Ta Phrom there are some spectacular silk cotton trees that have grown over walls and inner buildings.There is an effigy in the middle with an old woman who wants you to get a blessing by tying a string around your wrist. It is up to you whether you wish to do so.When you finally exit out the rear, take a walk around the outside along the path. If however, it has been raining and the path is flooded, retrace your steps and when in the centre, take the right hand passageway. Mind your head throughout your walk in this temple. The doorways become increasingly lower towards the centre to make people bow to the deity as they approach. When you exit you can then walk around the outside of the temple and see the vines and encroaching greenery. You will also see what they mean by stablising the monument. Be careful as the path can be slippery if it has been raining. You may encounter a man selling local ice cream on the way out. This ice cream comes in a long thick log which he cuts off and puts on a stick for you. Purchase the coconut ice cream. The chocolate is more like milo. It is only 50c each and helps the local economy."

In fact, of all the flat temples or what they call \u201cmonastic complex\u201d, Preah Khan is my favorite. My favorite photos of myself were mostly taken in Preah Khan. Perhaps it is the memorable intimate experience I had with Preah Khan. We were there as early as before 7 in the morning since we left Angkor Wat at 6:30 am. Having got there in the freshness of the day, we almost had the entire temple for ourselves! We were like the first visitors of the day! And that is why I guess I had the best photos taken in there. It was so peaceful and quiet; I had enough time to behold and feel all the mesmerizing carvings on the walls, pediments, all surfaces. Preah Khan almost have everything \u2013 lingas, Buddhas, apsaras, devatas, nagas, a stupa with direct sunlight on it, a garuda with oversized genital, trees growing on ruins, auxiliary buildings with an unknown purpose, a lake, name it.

Here only one head remains; the rest had all been eroded away. Once inside we were greeted with grey, green, and red walls sculpted with bas reliefs of apsara, warriors, firefly-Tinker Bell-like women along the top edges of inside walls, and huge fig and silk-cotton trees growing out of and into the building\u2019s stones.

There were also quite a few children there selling trickets as well. After I weeded my way through all of them - I was able to enjoy the beauty of this temple. This temple is very large and will take over an hour to really go through some of it. There are good photo ops with trees growing over and/or into parts of the temple. But there is still way less visitors here than at Ta Prohm. This temple complex is also larger so getting a good photo with no people in them can be done."

This temple is particularly known for its infinity door pictures, so that when you stand on one end and take a picture, you can see several door openings going onto what seems an infinity. Drivers normally drop you off at one end and pick up at another. Do not allow drivers to talk you into meeting them at the origin (they like to save on gas and cut corners at the inconvenience of the guest) because you will come out exhausted at the end having done a turnaround trip."

We reached here at about 430pm an hour before it closes and we had the whole temple to ourselves (in fact, we were the last to leave). You could explore the smaller rooms of in the temple to your own liking as long as it's not on the forbidden path (due to falling of rocks). A torch light will come in handy as we reached when the sunlight is no longer visible enough to guide us through the smaller rooms. It is said that there's a statue of the king's wife being worshipped in one of the smaller room and you need to explore for it. Unfortunately for us, as the sky was quite gloomy on that day, we didn't quite manage to explore the temple to the fullest even when we're armed with a torchlight. Overall a great experience and a good choice to wind down for the day. Less people and you may take your own sweet time."

It's huge; one can easily spend a couple of hours walking around exploring this site without getting tired or feeling that it's too much. There are many carved sections deep within that are pretty well preserved and therefore many special photos awaiting your camera. The combination of standing structures and fallen stones makes for a sometimes eerie experience as you think of what these stones must have witnessed over the centuries and what the place must have been like centuries ago.Another thing that I enjoyed is that there are fewer tourists here and that if you wanted some quiet time in an area of the temple, patience paid off as small groups moved on and you'd have a few moments before more people came through."

All the figures holding the Naga on the bridge across the moat are headless, said to have been stolen. There is much greenery around the moat. There are also interesting huge sculptures of Garuda (at 5m height) along the walls. At the East entrance you can see an ingrown tree on the wall to the left.This monastery is pretty much a ruin. It's very quiet except for some local boys who'd want to make some tips from guiding you. There are also many photo opportunities.

However, through my study, it was a temple that held many records:1. First temple that dedicated to many gods and deities.2. First temple with round pillars on a two stories \"mystical building\",3. A rare temple with a wide spread of one storey complex.The temple really showed me the meaning of \"ruins\"- badly damaged by natural forces. But the grandness of the temple could be seen afar before the main entrance, from the two rows of pillars set beside the mainroad that lead to the entrance. The whole temple covers an area of 700 x 800 m, enclosed by 100 m wide moat. It is believed that the temple once consisted of more than 100 towers with more than 100,000 people living at the surrounding area.Preah Khan located 2 km northward from Bayon, around 5 minutes by car. It is a quiet site comparatively. A visiting route from west to east is highly recommended, which will start from the road flanked by two rows of pillars, into the main entrance, right through the center of the temple with a stupa, and end at the east side of the temple, with a big kapok overgrown the wall of the temple. It is a site that highly recommended by me. A pre-visit study about the history and information of the site is essential, in order to treasure what we see in the temple.

The sheer scale of the site is impressive; it's set in 56 hectares of jungle, so we spent alot of time exploring and getting lost in the ruins. The most striking thing about Preah Khan though was the way the jungle has taken over - humongous silk-cotton and fig tree trunks rise out of the old temple walls, which their giant roots have pushed through and split apart over the centuries."

I don't know why not many people visit as it is no further than most of the other temples within or around the Angkor Thom vicinity. Perhaps, as we were told by our guide, the more 'famous' Ta Phrom (or 'Tomb Raider' temple) is similar i.e. overgrown trees engulfing the temple structures.However, at the Tomb Raider temple, during the high season and if you are unlucky enough to visit during the peak times, you can hardly get the opportunity to get a photo shot without someone walking into your path. And, you have to walk one way as turning back against traffic can be difficult at times.Here at Preah Khan, you get the same sights minus the crowd. The long, long corridors are fascinating. If you are slightly more sure footed, try walking around on the outside of the main structure, hoping from fallen stone to stone - gives you the explorer feel! Also, look out for the 'out of place' building within the grounds of the temple - suddenly, there is this 2 storey building that looks nothing like any Ankorian structure that I have seen. Our guide told us it was a library but some guide books say that its purpose is unknown. Photography? Snap away and take your own sweet time here.By going to this site, you would most probably pass through the North gate of Angkor Thom as well, where the surroundings are more green and makes a much better photo than the South gate.Having said that, I am not at all suggesting that you do not visit Ta Phrom/'Tomb Raider temple. However, this site gave me the 'authentic' feel."

I kept saying that I would like to visit some less popular temples but he kept insisting on the lake! Sensing a hidden agenda (and getting annoyed!) I cancelled our third day with him and instead we took off in a tuk tuk without a guide. We enjoyed this much more!!We had our children, aged 7 and 8 with us and they really loved Preah Khan. It is really huge but really peaceful. Whilst there we heard only the noises of the jungle and saw about 10 other people. The air is perfumed with wild flowers and hundreds of butterflies dance like the Apsara dancers on the reliefs. Very magical.It helped having had a guide to explain the motifs and layouts of Angkor Watt, Bayon and Ta Prohm so we understood what we saw and what part of the temple we were in. However, it was so much cooler to just be by ourselves wandering round this amazing temple. Oh and there are some huge trees growing out of some of the buildings towards the East gate too so it felt like a (much) quieter version of Ta Prohm!Amazing place, you must go!!"
