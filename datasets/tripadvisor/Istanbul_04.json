            "review": "The Very Best! Instanbul with a Local. I booked two Intrepid Travel ~ Urban Adventure tours while I was in Istanbul. The first one was the 'Half Day Sight Seeing Tour (Grand Bazaar, Suleymaniye Mosque and Sultanahmet)'. The second tour was 'Eat Like A Local and Cultural Tour with Dinner at a Local Home'.I used Intrepid Travel a few years ago in Nepal and India for a 12 day tour called 'Through the Footsteps of Buddha'. I had an incredible experience and have always been a fan of Intrepid Travel and I recommended them often to friends and family. I was really excited to know that they do city tours and specialty cultural tours through their Urban Adventures branch. Both of the tours I went on via Intrepid Travel / Urban Adventures held up to their incredible reputation and quality. After booking... the communications, logistics, etc. were easy to understand and follow. The pace was perfect. I never felt rushed or left on my own to figure out and learn about the various sites.A great tour happens only when you have a great tour guide. I was fortunate to have Ekrem Seyhan for both of the tours. Ekrem was not great, he was incredible! He makes you feel immediately welcomed, explains the plan for the day and is conscientious that everyone is understanding and enjoying their tour. Ekrem was open to discuss any questions regarding Turkey, the Islamic religion, politics, culture, values, etc. This made the tour extra special and everyone felt like they were included and I learned way more than expected. A guide like Ekrem makes a great tour an exceptional tour.I will value these two tours through Intrepid Travel ~ Urban Adventures forever and will recommend them to friends and family.Thank you!!"

            "review": "Istanbul Uncovered and Istanbul In Focus - The Olive Tree. While in Istanbul, I was able to go on two different Urban Adventures tours. I have toured with Urban Adventures in other cities, and know that they have a quality product. My first tour was In Focus, The Olive Tree of Istanbul. This is a new strand of tours for Urban Adventures and has a social element to it. I visited the Olive Tree center, which works with Syrian refugees. The program included a tour of the facility, dinner made by center members and a chance to talk with people that are currently being served by the center. It was a wonderful opportunity to talk with people displaced by the war in Syria and to hear their stories. It was also great to learn about the Olive Tree and Small Projects Istanbul, an NGO that runs the center. If you want to know more about what is being done in Istanbul to help Syrian refugees and to support this project (they had craft items available for sale made by women served by the center) this is a great way to do it. And the food was to die for. My second tour was the Istanbul Uncovered tour. I visited the Grand Bazaar, several side streets and nooks around the Bazaar and Suleymaniye Mosque (tip, it\u2019s so much less crowded than the Blue Mosque and just as beautiful!) We also picked up amazing potato pastries outside of the Bazaar and stopped at a local shisha and tea house and talked more about local culture while enjoying our snacks. I had a wonderful time on my tour with Suileyman. He was knowledgeable, friendly and engaging. He was able to answer my many questions and helped me to learn more about areas in the city that I had visited, but did not have in-depth information about. It was a very worthwhile experience and I will definitely use Urban Adventures again when visiting other cities."

We came to Istanbul a few days after the failed military coup, not too long after some bombings and spending time with a local gave us such confidence to explore this amazing city!!! We learnt so much about local life in Istanbul, tried all the local flavours, sat and relaxed at a traditional tea shop, had amazing food throughout! It was the best possible way to step into a culture that we thought was so different! In fact we felt right at home after taking this tour! Our guide was fantastic (though I can't remember his name, he was in the middle of planning his wedding) and we had a great time.Tips and tricks - don't eat before you take this tour, when the guide says don't fill up on this, there's more to come BELIEVE THEM! You will not go hungry, you will most likely end up skipping one or two stops to make some room for the later stops! Don't be squeamish. I tried all the local delicacies and they all tastes great, don't think about what's in them, just experience it! Yes you will get to sit down. Bon appetite!"

Our guide Emre was very courteous and helpful, and stay with us for even longer than planned. We never felt rushed to go to the next site, and had an overall lovely evening. The spots were all great, and the experience was very memorable, I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is planning on going. My only criticism would be that I wish there was more information and details of the city, sites, and dishes. Other than that it was great!"

Upon contacting the company, we had a \"compilation tour\" made to show us what they could. Cumali was our guide and he was fantastic! He had such great knowledge of the history and modern aspects of the city. We visited all the must see places and had the most delicious lunch on the Asian side of the Bosphorus. I would not hesitate to recommend the company or the experience. Don't be put off by recent happenings in Turkey. We never felt unsafe and had the most amazing time. I can't wait to go back and see more!Thank you again for helping us with our tour "

Two fantastic ladies (volunteers) guided us through the Capa district in Istanbul, towards The Olive Tree were we were warmly welcomed by Syrian ladies. Had time and opportunity to discuss with both volunteers and the Syrian ladies, whilst enjoying a wonderful meal cooked by the Syrian ladies at the center. So sad to learn their stories. So heart warming on the other hand to discover amazing initiatives of the very few that make it their goal to create awareness for a humanitarian crisis that concerns us all!

It was good to be able to ask a local some questions. For me, the tour was just the tip of the amazing cuisine that Istanbul has a result of my experiences during my stopovers. For me visiting a 'local' grocery store (not a big 'globalised' supermarket) to see some of the many ingredients. Olives and cheeses are a staple in this cuisine and we did not touch on them, or any desserts, pides etc I enjoyed the conversations that we had."

A wonderful program assisting with language and work skills. We then shared a meal prepared for us before heading back to our hotel.

I highly recommend that anyone who has the chance to get to Istanbul make time for this tour. Our guide Ekrem was so inviting, frank, and informative and the experience gave us a great opportunity to actually gain some insight into the daily life for locals and the three of us on the tour together felt like we had gained a new friend by the end of the night despite having just met a few hours prior. Ekrem took us to eat at a local family's house and for nargile after. The host family were just as gracious and inviting as our guide and the meal Serey cooked for us of eggplant, soup, mezze, and tea was delicious. Despite the fact that Serey spoke only Turkish, with the help of translation by Ekrem we were able to have a great conversation about our respective cultures and at the end of the night she let us know, 'we now have a home away from home anytime we're back in Istanbul.'"

After searching many tour operators , we decided to book our trips with urban adevntures. Because of that we knew the most visited sites in Istanbul , we chose their morning trip and night trip. Our guide was Tolga for the morning trip. He was very informative and friendly. He knew all the back streets of Istanbul and took us to many places where we couldnt find on our own. We loved Rustem Pasha mosque most. Lovely tiles. We ended in spice market and tried different types of Turkish delights. We were very sad to finish the tour with Tolga. Many thanks to him. We , later , met with Borak. He is just a real foodie. Ask for him if you want to know about Turkish street food. He took us to new part of Istanbul. We tried many street foods such as mussels , chestnust, meatballs , mezes and even lamb intestine. Dont ask what it is. You just love it if you dont know what it is. :) Burak was very friendly and expert on food. He responded all of our questions with a great patient. He was also very generous about his time so he stayed with us a bit longer and we kept asking him some more questions about the Istanbul and more things. We loved drinking their local beer and tried raki as well. Be carefull about raki :) Thanks to Urban Adventures Istanbul for making us have a great day in such a short time. Highly recommended."

Our guide, Fatih for Home Cooked Istanbul was knowledgeable and friendly, he took us for tea, to a local house for dinner and then we ended up beating him at backgammon because his lessons were too good! The food was sensational, and I wish I had remembered to ask for the recipe. I'd highly recommend this tour for something different to do in Istanbul.Istanbul Conquered was a full day (~0830-1700) day tour, covering the major attractions of Istanbul. Our guide, Ju Ju was very knowledgeable and ran the day at our pace (we only had three members) with regular stops for refreshments and a chat. Although we could've 'seen the sights' on our own, the information from Ju Ju made everything make sense, we were also to ensure we saw a lot in a limited time frame. My friend was leaving at the end of the tour straight to the airport and Ju Ju even managed to arrange somewhere to leave her backpack during the day. We had an excellend day, thank you."

I signed up for the Istanbul Uncovered tour at the last minute (late the night before), which was really easy to do on their website. I enjoyed not having to organize everything well in advance if I didn't yet know my plans and being able to do everything seamlessly online. Unfortunately for me, there was a sudden snow storm overnight and the city was a nightmare to get around in its wake. My guide, Pinor, very kindly called me the morning of to ask if I wanted to reschedule my tour, but because I was already on my way to the meeting point and leaving Istanbul the next day, I requested we move forward with the tour. She could have just said no because the weather-affected traffic made it too difficult to reach me, but she didn't. Her kindness and determination to make it to the meeting point on time were incredibly admirable. She even called me a few times to give me updates on how soon she would arrive!Despite the snow bearing down on us, Pinor still gave a top-notch tour. She tried to take me down as many of the paths that are included in the tour when Istanbul ISN'T freezing over and did her best to deviate the tour when necessary while still showing me the highlights. Her knowledge of the sites was enviable. I wish I could know as much as she does! Given that the tour was one-on-one, I felt really comfortable asking her all sorts of questions, ranging from things we were looking at to aspects of Turkish daily life. With regard to the highlights of Istanbul Uncovered, I would highly recommend the tour. You don't go into the main sites (the Hagia Sophia, Topkapi Palace, and the Blue Mosque), but if you go into the those on your own, as I did, the tour is a great supplement. I learned a great deal about the sites that may not have been included in a tour taken inside them because they were little facts that needed to be recounted from the outside. Other highlights included a back street (I think -- the snow made it difficult to tell what it was, really) that led to typical Ottoman houses, the Spice Bazaar, and the Grande Bazaar. My only suggestion would be that the walk through the Grande Bazaar was more than just that: a walk through. We went in one side and out the other in under five minutes. If we could have wondered the streets a bit more and heard about the culture of the Bazaar, or perhaps stopped to take a coffee/tea in one of the cafes inside the Bazaar, it would have made the site feel more authentic. Though I understand that once you've seen one rug shop, you've seen them all, so there might not be much to examine in-depth. Thank you Pinor for your amazing tour and your ability to put up with that horrible, rare weather! You made my otherwise iffy time in Istanbul (stupid snow!) an experience to remember."

Booked this tour through Viator - about $10 USD more than what you can arrange through the Urban Adventures Tours website under the tour \"Istanbul Night Tasting Trail\".Beyoglu and the labyrinth of cobblestoned pathways that weave their way too and from Istiklal street is an amazing place to discover food, drink and turkish hospitality all within such a friendly and genuine atmosphere. But its not something that can completed on short stays - the help of a local really helped us to find and sample the staples.Pinar Kilic was such a sweet and attentive host that asked us for our culinary aversions and preferences and planned a trip based on that. She knew just which roads to take to bring us to the tables that locals occupy for foods that locals love. We so appreciate your kindness and follow up to our questions during and after our visit. We were able to sample delicacies and after pub food from \"known\" street vendors that we otherwise would not have tried due to concerns over content and preparation. Touring with Pinar really allowed us to let our guard down and depend upon the experience of a generous local.We'd love to return because in sampling in one concentrated tour, some of the favourites in snack and late night food, we came to realize exactly how much there is really remaining to sample - we saw only the tip of the iceberg.Thanks again Pinar!"

Unfortunately, I didn't take into consideration a few things like travel time from airport to Sultanahmet, etc before booking this tour, and I missed my tour. Luckily, the guy from my hostel helped me call Urban Adventure. Jen from their office was nice enough to reschedule me on my next available night. I met with our guide, Mahsum, and another lady in the Pudding shop for my newly rescheduled tour. I was glad that I got rescheduled that night since it was nice and intimate with just me and another person. We started with a quick walk to the Hippodrome. Then, we went to our host family\u2019s house for dinner. It was a simple but authentic dinner, but I really enjoyed talking with Mahsum and the host family. I learned a lot about their culture and their life in Istanbul. After dinner, Mahsum took us to a bar where we had Turkish tea and took turns with smoking shisha. He also taught us to play backgammon. Time went by fast as we were having a lot. The experience was been great since we had a superb guide with Mahsum. Overall, I would definitely recommend this tour for those who want to experience something unique and extraordinary. It\u2019s not for people expecting to do touristy stuff, but if you want to really to experience something authentic, this is for you!"

I was charmed by Sarai's warmth and curiosity. This was one of the highlights of my trip. It was a privilege to be invited in the home of a Turkish family, break bread, and chat about some of the realities of our opposite worlds. Despite the language barrier, our lovely host Pinar helped make everyone feel at ease. It was a rich and nuanced cultural experience. I'm glad I had this opportunity to widen my perspective. Thank you for accommodating my toddlers. It was a fun evening for my husband and me to relax on the trip while our kids played with Sarai's childen."

Small group of us, we met the tour guide Tolga who is a cool honest chilled guy and we headed into Istanbul. Tolga took us to a local house in an area of Istanbul I wouldn't have thought to have gone. The group was welcomed into the locals house and we enjoyed some awesome food. Fresh, different, variety, home made and just so so different to all the restaurants on the main tourist areas. We then headed for coffee and shesha at a local cafe. The entire night was a great experience. You need to try it. The walking tour was on Sunday it is called conquer Istanbul in a day. We had Tolga again as the guide. Early start to the day and at the end I knew why. Sooo much to see and experience that's why. We saw everything, visited all the major sites on the Sunday and even went to some of Tolga's fav places. The views just blew my mind. The architecture of the place. The history and the stories that Tolga shared just added to the day. Massive thanks to him and for urban adventures for providing such an experience without any fuss. Amazing. Nice one!"

It was a unique opportunity to question or hostess (English speaking translator available) on her way of life, and to get an insight into Turkey off the beaten track. An enjoyable evening, if a little pricey even by Turkey's standards or comparable experiences in different countries, although I think that is the result of going through a 'middle man' and it was essential to get the most out of the experience. The local experience made it worthwhile and our translator/guide was excellent."

Both guides where thorough with history but not so much that we were bored.We also did both tours with our 1 year old son and both guides were totally understanding about our specific needs (however, we have an extremely easy and accommodating child).

As we learned from Tolga, this experience was created not as a money making one, but to help local families earn extra income. Tolga translated our questions as well, so we were able to learn more about our host family. After the meal, we walked close by for some more conversation and tried the Turkish water pipe. What a fantastic end to an all around great experience! Thank you Tolga for everything you did to make this our best Istanbul experience yet!"

I think that the variety and order in which I ate the food affected me, I don't usually eat this way. We stared with a wet burger and ayran, then chocolate, then mezes with raiki, then stuffed mussels and lambs intestine sandwiches, then 3 kinds of baklava with tea, and finally some kind of layered pasta (I barely ate baklava and did not touch the pasta because by this point I was not feeling well).

I will never forget the Kurdish coffee with milk and pistachios, it's milder and has better taste than Turkish coffee. I tried to order it in other restaurants in Istanbul but it was not available. Because of this guided tour, we were able to visit the less touristic area of Istanbul, walk along the vibrant Istiklal street, ride in the Funicular, meet local people and the artists of the Istanbul street art, tried the local food for the first time and discover Turkey and its people in a different perspective.

The family home we visited (a family originally from the Kurdish area of Turkey) were very welcoming in their home and provided a simple but delicious meal. This tour is a great way for tourists to see behind the scenes of the Turkish lifestyle and to also support local families who host dinners. Following dinner we visit a popular local shisha cafe set in a former Islamic school (Medrese), this shisha cafe was full of locals and not fellow tourists which again made the experience all the more genuine.

The tour was to highlight European side of Old and New Istanbul. We met at the the old side by the Spice Market and proceeded to Taskim which is in New Istanbul. As promised we tried an Istak burger and turkish coffee as well as tried so chocolate. However, that was all that we did when the tour promised more.The tour promised for us to take the \"perfect shot of 19th century architecture\", having our coffee read by a Turkish fortune teller, and then back to Old Istanbul to see the fish market. None of these things happened and the tour ended an hour early where we were left at the Galata Tower. I thought it was unusual, but being that I did not have access to review the itinerary, I thought best to go back to the hotel and check to see if we missed out on things set further in the itinerary (which I confirmed these items were promised on the itinerary and we didn't do it). I subsquently emailed the Company, on 8/20/2015, which I received a response from Jen apologizing and saying that they would investigate the matter with the tour guide the following Monday and then will follow up with a response which I never received. I then sent a follow up email on 8/26/2015 as I thought it was adequate time to receive a response back, but I still haven't received a response since.As a customer, I am really disappointed of the level of service provided by the Company since I paid for a service that I received only half of. Also, the fact that the Company promised that they will get back to me and then have not has prompted me to give such a low rating as it is rather disrespectful to say you would do something and then not follow through. I did a tour with them a couple of days before which I had a very positive experience and I do think the tour guide for this tour, Ashe, was knowledgeable and very friendly. However, the overall experience negates this as I would not be taking any tours with this Company do to the lack of communication received."

The first half hour was spent by the guide, Tolga, standing in front of a map and giving us a history lesson on Turkey from day one. This was way too much information and could just as easily be told as we walked to our first destination. The tour included the usual tourist highlights which are, of course, magnificent. It would have been nice to have some anecdotal information for exams about the huge cat population in Istanbul or human interest. It would also have been nice to have been offered a water and toilet stop instead of having to ask for one.It was a good tour taking in all the high spots and well worth it for first time visitors to this wonderful city."

This tour allows you between 8:30 AM and 5 PM to see significant and memorable architectural and cultural sites of Istanbul WITHOUT waiting on the lonnnng lines. What is additionally great about Urban Adventures is even if only ONE person is booked on the tour, the tour still runs. This was my lucky case. I was the only one on this tour which meant I was able to set the pace and glean so much interesting information from my guide. Abdullah was fantastic, super knowledgeable and just an all around gem of a guide. For part of the tour, we stopped and had lunch at a local eatery and this was included in the cost of the tour. I feel incredibly lucky to have been on this tour and with such a fantastic guide Abdullah. On a different day, I participated in the Urban Adventure tour titled, \"Picnic On Two Continents\". Love this tour as well! Tolga was our awesome guide. You meet at the Spice Bazaar and meander through, tasting delicious delights and flavors as you go. Our guide Tolga collected food from the different vendors and then we took the ferry over to the Asian side of Istanbul. After visiting a food market on the Asian side, we enjoyed a picnic at a beautiful spot next to the Bosphorus. This tour was fantastic! If you are visiting Istanbul for a few days, I highly suggest going on any of the tours sponsored by Urban Adventures. Staff are down to earth and kind as well as super knowledgeable and enthusiastic about Istanbul. Thank you Urban Adventures especially Abdullah and Tolga."

The meeting place sounds obscure however if traveling from a hotel across the Golden Horn or even in the center of Sultanahmet, mention the Hippodrome or Sultan Ahmet Square and the taxi driver will be certain to know the location. Taking pictures is a must to relive the experience and then go back to look up many of the facts that will be part of the sites. Our guide, Osman, was great - informative and patient with our group. We had lunch in a local eatery, Can Restaurant. The food was tasty and filling. Finally, the Grand Bazaar is open all days except Sunday and is full of glitz and bling. Some good bargains are sure to be found.For your trip back to your hotel, be sure to get a taxi fare set in advance and drive a hard bargain. Be prepared for a wild ride!"

Note to readers: As there are a few mosques covered in this tour and respecting their culture, please wear appropriate clothing covering head to toe. They do however provide clothing at the entrance of every mosque but its best not to draw too much attention by wearing revealing clothing).The tour guide took us to to the blue mosque, hippodrome in Sultanahmet before taking us to the other mosques via visiting the Grand bazaar and in the end the spice bazaar. He had interesting stories about each place and made it very entertaining. He also took us to his favourite local eatery shop and we tasted the most amazing Pide (a kind of pizza). He also stopped us after 2 hrs and took us to a rooftop cafe where you could look at the amazing view of the european side and the asian side of istanbul while sipping on lovely Apple Tea! The experience was complete when Suleyman had a souvenir for all of us at the end of the tour. All in all - a complete experience and it felt as though Suleyman was more of a friend than a tour guide! Kudos to Suleyman and Urban adventure for this tour!"

Emre treated us to Turkish tea at a restaurant, and a baked pretzel from a street vendor he knew. Both were great. Emre spoke clearly and we were told numerous stories and listened to the history of Istanbul while we walked. When we ended the tour after extra time, we were given clear directions back to our starting point. Our second tour was the Hagia Sophia Museum with Aziz. We were met outside the museum by another couple from Austria. Because we had booked this tour, we did not have to wait in line for tickets as Aziz had them already, so we walked right to the security area and then inside we went. Our tour lasted a little longer than an hour, and we explored the entire building. Having a guide like Aziz made the experience so much more interesting and meaningful."

On the plus side: Tolga was very personable and broadly knowledgeable about history and current events; the walk to and from dinner was through an interesting neighborhood and into a modest home off the tourist path; our radiant local hostess provided a good, ample dinner. On the negative: several people (including one who used a rolling walker) were surprised by the need to navigate fairly steep, narrow, cobbled streets, and others by having to get up and down from the floor to eat dinner. Although it wasn't a highly-informative \"food tour\" I was happy to see how a struggling, hard-working family lived in Istanbul, and to help them earn some extra income."

            "review": "Excellent tour guide on a tour of the Spice Bazaar followed by a picnic. My best friend and I did the Istanbul Street Food Tour and Picnic with Ekrem, an excellent tour guide from Urban Adventures. Ekrem is a young, friendly Turkish guy who lives in Istanbul and is very knowledgeable and open to answering any questions.We were pleasantly surprised to find that my friend and I were the only tourists for the tour on that day \u2013 which to their credit, they kept rather than cancelled the tour.Here\u2019s what we did during the tour and picnic:\u25a0 First off, we had the introductions and a summary of what to expect.\u25a0 During the start of our walk, I was intrigued by a mosque near the Spice Bazaar \u2013 and no, it wasn\u2019t the Yeni Cami (the New Mosque) but the R\u00fcstem Pasha Mosque which is smaller and is famous for their beautiful blue Iznik tiles. So, Ekrem took us there for a brief visit \u2013 which felt special as it\u2019s not a mosque that most tourists would know to visit.\u25a0 Next, we went to a few stalls (on the outside of the Spice Bazaar) to sample some food (string cheese, Turkish delights, candy, etc) including a sesame seed covered pretzel-like bagel called simit. I had been curious about that and it was OK \u2013 a little plain and dry.\u25a0 After the food samples and Ekrem had bought all the food (baklava, deep fried anchovies with some bread, Turkish pizza) for our picnic, we headed to the nearby ferry terminal where Ekrem bought and paid for the 1-way ferry ride to \u00dcsk\u00fcdar which was on the Asian side of Istanbul.\u25a0 The ferry ride took about 20 minutes to reach \u00dcsk\u00fcdar and we then walked another 20 minutes along the waterfront \u2013 all the while, looking for an open spot to sit and have our picnic.\u25a0 Unfortunately, that day was a holiday weekend and it was particularly busier than normal along the waterfront. Hence, it took a while to find some unoccupied cushions to sit on. We eventually found some cushions in an area facing the Maiden\u2019s Tower island directly. (Check out the photos below) Beyond that in the distant was the European side of Istanbul. On a clear, beautiful day, I am sure it would be a sight to behold but with the cloudy, muggy weather that day \u2013 it was less impressive.\u25a0 Once we were seated, Ekrem flagged down some waiters. We paid for some cold soda (as it was a warm day) while Ekrem paid for some Turkish tea. Ekrem then took the picnic food out and we had our little picnic while admiring the views of European Istanbul in front of us.\u25a0 After 45 minutes of picnic and good conversation, we headed back towards \u00dcsk\u00fcdar to take the Marmaray train (instead of the ferry) back to the European side of Istanbul. Ekrem paid for these tickets and accompanied us to the Yenikapi station where we got off (as this was closest to our hotel) and said our goodbyes.Pros:\u25a0 It was our good luck to have a very personalized tour for 2 and to have Ekrem as our guide.\u25a0 Even though the Rustem Pasha Mosque wasn\u2019t on the itinerary, Ekrem took us there for a short visit when he sensed my interest in seeing it.\u25a0 The tour was a very good value as it lasted over 4 hours and we got so much useful information and had all our questions answered. Even after I ran out of questions to ask, Ekrem continued to offer more historical, political and cultural insights into Turkey. At times, the insights turned personal which was great to hear especially since it provided us with insights not found in guide books.\u25a0 Having a guide with you to sample the various foods is a must because of the language barrier. Ekrem was also helpful when it came to helping us buy the best dried dates to take home.Cons:\u25a0 It took a little effort to find out Ekrem as the directions were a little vague. I had to ask around until I found Ekrem. A better way to identify a tour guide is if a sign or umbrella or some distinguishing item (a red balloon) was held up to make it easier to find the tour guide amongst so many people.In summary, we had a great time hanging out with Ekrem who treated us like friends rather than tourists. I highly recommend this tour \u2013 especially if you can get Ekrem to show you around."

I was travelling on my own and the Urban Adventures \"Eat Like a Local\" (also called \"Home Cooked Istanbul\") evening walking tour appealed as a sensible alternative to eating by myself. It turned out to be one of my best evenings out ever. We met Tolga, our guide, as arranged and he led us through the back streets of the Sultanahmet area of Istanbul, to the home of a local family where we ate a superb meal. I was sceptical that this tour would really give us a taste of local life but it did just that and provided real insight into a different standard of living. We ended the evening drinking tea a trying a waterpipe (I declined this experience, but others enjoyed it, the waterpipes were tobacco-free by the way) Our host family and my fellow travellers were delightful company and I would recommend this to anyone who like to walk around cities, who can cope with short but very steep hills and is happy to eat sitting on the floor"

The two Americans I met on the tour made it a great evening. However, if you want a real Istanbul food experience, I suggest that you book with Culinary Backstreets in Istanbul who know their food with real passion."

The guide went on regardless when it would have been better to be flexible and do something else.

My husband and two daughters both had a great time. Thanks Tolga for being an awesome tour guide."

Our guide Iskender was fantastic, very knowledgeable & knew he stuff, he was always happy to answer any questions and made us feel comfortable, he clearly loves his job which makes it a nice experience as you felt like he was also enjoying the tour. As there was just two of us we were able to do things that maybe weren't on the tour, like sample some turkish ice cream, so he allowed us to customise it a little. He showed us places that we would never have found on our own & showed us the real istanbul. I can't reccomend the walking tours enough. He goes at a pace which is comfortable for you and you really don't feel like your doing much walking at all. We loved the wet burgers you get on this tour and my first game of back gammon & first taste of turkish coffee with the locals was a brilliant touch in the middle of the tour, a good way to rest. Our trip wouldn't be the same without this tour and as a travel agent I will recommend it to everyone."

There was only one other couple taking the tour, so it felt private and exclusive. S\u00fcleyman took us on a brief 10-minute walk through the Hppodrome and past the Blue Mosque, through the residential part of the Sultanahmet district and into a private apartment (all the way at the top of some rickety stairs), where he introduced the lady of the house, Katriya, and her two boys, aged 7 and 9. We were ushered into a small living room and invited to sit on a couple of sofas. It was predictably a little awkward at first, but soon the conversation was flowing, aided by S\u00fcleyman's expert translation (the hosts spoke no English). We asked and answered questions about work and school, and shared pictures of children and pets. Food was served on a tablecloth traditionally spread on the floor; there was a salad, lentil soup, beans and rice, and pudding for dessert: a simple but delicious meal. After a couple of hours, we said our thanks and goodbyes (in retrospect, wishing we had brought something small for the kids - you should do that if you take this tour) and were taken by S\u00fcleyman out to a shisha (waterpipe) bar (another quick 10-minute walk), where we had apple tea, tried smoking an apple-flavored shisha, and (with much instruction from S\u00fcleyman) played some backgammon. It was a delightful evening and we recommend this tour to anyone who is outgoing enough and looking for a slightly different experience. Note: if you don't react well to lots of indoors smoke, the waterpipe part is probably not for you."

And if you\u2019re worried that perhaps some things may get lost in translation, don\u2019t be \u2013 Iskender\u2019s English is excellent with a very listenable accent. He imparted with easy-to-understand commentary on the history of the city, its buildings, the people of Istanbul and the streets and food. We are so glad we booked to go on this tour, as it really set us up for the rest of our trip by being guided around an area we probably wouldn\u2019t typically have explored. Not only that, of course, it was an easy way to try many foods and drinks in one night that we may not have consumed during our whole stay.

After dinner we went to Sisha caf\u00e9 to try sisha like locals. If you want to see how locals live and have food, just book this tour. I will come back to Istanbul soon."

So while we were in Istanbul, I thought this would be nice to do for his birthday. I booked this tour and it is something that is completely outside of my comfort zone. But it ended up being the best thing ever. Our tour guide, Tolga Kinas, met us at the Pudding Shop. We were the only couple, so it had a slight romantic aspect to it. We walked to the family's house, and although they did not speak English, our guide was able to translate for us. The family was lovely! We had a wonderful and my boyfriend the chef LOVED it!!! We smoked shisha and drank apple tea afterwards. I felt good because we were able to give back to a local family, and they opened their house to us and shared their culture with us. I totally recommend."

The hospitality of the Kurdish family we visited was warm and open, with their excited children trying out a few words in English with us (and obviously understanding us well!). A delicious meal followed, with Caner translating our questions to the family and answering general questions about Turkish customs. It was then off to a hookah bar where some of us tried for the first ( and probably only ) time. A word of advice - whilst drinking alcohol was perfectly acceptable in other bars and restaurants, do not ask for an alcoholic drink in one of these bars.

I decided to book \"Home Cooked Istanbul\" right when I got off the flight. I called and mentioned I would be 10-15 minutes late. There was 5 including myself booked onto the excursion and no one showed up except me. We waited for 20 minutes. The issue was the family had cooked enough for that many people and so she was kind of upset when the other didn't show because the food would possibly be wasted. I felt really bad, but the dinner with the family was VERY authentic. The apartment was small, but it gave a decent understanding of what life is like there. The family had 2 young boys that were really cute and I learned that this year in Turkey, they started making English mandatory for the primary schoolers, instead of only secondary school. Therefore in about 10 years time, more Turkish people will be able to speak English. After a fantastic meal my guide, Burak took me to an authentic Turkish Shisha house. It is actually an old converted University and I was probably the only foreigner in the building. We had a great time smoking Shisha, however I was very tired and jet-lagged from my flight, that I made it a short night. Since I had no sense of direction, Burak was kind enough to walk me back to my hotel, although the streets of Istanbul are very busy and safe.Burak was a great guide and I really appreciated my first night in Istanbul. The cost was very reasonable, and if you are looking for an authentic night, do yourselves a favour and book this one"

Tolga was friendly and is a wonderful person but I felt there wasn't much history given about Istanbul or what we were doing. Tolga is a quiet guy so unless we asked questions he would very politely inform us and share but I felt the tour was not fast enough or made the most of the couple of hours. Where we walked were to places we could have done easily alone and we did so after the next few days. The coffee cup reading was ok but we sat in the bar waiting for the guy for i think nearly an hour or close to so i felt was a bit of a waste of time. I like to explore different and interesting places that we can't do alone and be told as much info, history, facts etc about the city visiting. Perhaps this is who ever is training the guides to be more informative.Also the meeting point on Intrepid notes needs to be much clearer and Tolga was not in an urban adventures shirt or with a sign or name tag so was impossible to know who he is? I had to call head office (on my phone which costs a lot internationally) and the lady had to describe Tolga, that is the only reason found him. The picnic ( street food tour) was ok, uynfortunatley the weather changed & started to pour with rain and storm. This is obviously out of the guides control but there was no back up plan given to him so we walked & found a spot in the park at a restaurant under cover..During that time not much info again was given about Istanbul, we mostly sat and ate. Which again Mum & I could have done our selves and we had already been to the spice market the day before..I would have preferred not to have paid for a \"tour\" we didn't pay for anything out of the ordinary although we had a really nice time with Tolga but it was more like we had just paid for his time to be there.I feel perhaps this isn't Tolga's fault but perhaps the guides need some strog training and back plans for tours especially if the weather is not great!"

It great to sit in the home of locals and talk about literally anything you want to. The family we visited was welcoming and made enjoyable conversation - through Tolga's translation.

This was followed with a lovely meal and was very enjoyable, not only was the food tasty but we learned some of the local etiquette. We spoke about their family and what they did for a living and the effects of Ramadan on the cooking as our host could not taste test to ensure the meal was satisfactory.

A few things to note:1) You go inside the Blue Mosque and Sultanahmet Mosque and the Grand Bazaar and Spice Bazaar but not the Aya Sofia or the Basilica Cistern. Those last two are right next to each other though so you can easily go back after the tour since the tour ends around 1. 2) You need a couple hours and a dedicated tour for the Topkapi Palace, we passed through the grounds on this tour but didn't go in - that's a separate event if you want to do it."

The home we went to was nice and cozy, and the people there were very welcoming. As soon as we had arrived, around 7:00pm, the host started laying down the food for our dinner. Saleh was acting as a translator throughout.For starters, the had served a salad, which I was told is usually served around all the restaurants in Istanbul, but this had to be the best tasting salad that I would have had during the trip. This was followed by Dolma, the traditional dish of bell pepper or vine leaves stuffed with rice. The servings were plentiful to the point that I was unable to finish all that was served. The dinner concluded with servings of traditional Turkish tea. The food was delicious and I would have definitely made a second visit if I had the time during my trip.My wife and I were traveling with our daughter, 2 years of age. Because of our daughter, we decided to skip the smoking of the shisha pipe. Instead, Saleh took us to a coffee shop and offered us coffee and snacks.What I enjoyed most about this tour was the fact that we get to see and understand how people live their daily lives.

I thought the \"Eat Like A Local Tour\" would be something interesting and cultural to do for a short time (about 3-4 hours) together with my sister who was going to Istanbul for work, while I flew in from a different country to meet her. In the end, a number of her co-workers decided to come along as well. We were divided into two groups of 10-11 persons each. First our guide Sukru explained to us that the Turkish family we will visit is poor and such tours help them generate income. We were led through neighbourhoods with old houses where interesting information were relayed to us. Sukru also tactfully suggested that we bring some small presents for the children and we stopped on the way to purchase sweets and chocolates. The family welcomed us warmly and allowed the group to look into all their rooms and take any amount of photographs. I personally found that slightly intrusive, but the visitors were curious and excited to be in the home of someone from a different culture. Our lady host was very open with answering our questions. Sukru was extremely patient with our barrage of questions ranging from education to healthcare to social security and courtship/marriage in Turkey, and exemplary in translating the conversations. The thing that touched me most was that our host apologised at the beginning for the state of her home because she was not able to clean house. Her sister suffered a heart attack earlier in the day and was admitted to hospital. I salute her for her professionalism in cooking for the lot of us despite a major personal setback. There were three dishes, as others have posted before, and tea at the end. Everything was cooked with heart and of course very delicious!The evening ended with a nargile (shisha) session at a big Turkish cafe where some people were playing backgammon and basically just chilling out. It turned out to be a fascinating experience for non-smokers and those who were game to try something new. I recommend apple and peach flavours. Children and people who are sensitive to a smoky environment probably should sit out this part.Priceless experience. Highly recommended."

We met our guide just outside the Spice Market and he took us on several stops in and around the Bazaar including bread shops, pizza, Turkish delights, delis, and more. It was a great way to experience some of the local culture and try some different food. The guide was very knowledgeable and helpful with questions. Would definitely recommend to anyone visiting Istanbul, a great tour at a great value!"

I loved how personal it felt with it being a group of only 8 people including our guide and how we wandered freely from place to place without the restrictions that large guided tours would have imposed. I thoroughly want to recommend Salih who was a very friendly and informative guide and made sure that the pace was never too fast that we couldn't keep up. I got to see the obvious of Istanbul with its mosques, bazaars and spice markets and also got to see a lot of the hidden treasures kept away in the back alleys where no one would think to look ... the cosy tea room and the lunch we had in a hidden away place was a lovely touch and it thoroughly added to the experience. Would thoroughly recommend this tour as a great way to start a holiday in Istanbul and get you acquainted with just how much Istanbul has to offer. 10/10"

Lentil soup, raita, rice and (baked) beans and a bulgur wheat salad with delicious bread was washed down with water, our non-existent Turkish translated by Salih and Seldah. We were able to ask about life in Istanbul, play with the family pet ( a kitten) and encourage the older children with their rudimentary English. After supper and saying out goodbyes to the family to allow the children to go to bed, we were then taken to a traditional Turkish 'bar' where the men (and women) drink coffee and smoke water/hookah pipes. Not wishing to smoke or drink Turkish coffee, we did not stay but enjoyed the offer.This is the type of tour which helps the local economy, promotes social and cultural understanding and broadens the mind - well done Urban Adventures and Saleh for your undertaking of such events."

My wife really enjoyed with their kids and we actually felt like at home. After leaving this family home, we went on enjoying Turkish tea and Sheesha at one of popular places. The whole tour in itself was a great experience. For us, one of the major highlights of the tour was the guide himself. Erkan and his friend (sorry I forgot her name) were great and fun guys to be with. From Turkish history to culture, and from education system of turkey to latest economic reforms and developments, they answered every question of ours very politely and in v detail. I would definitely recommend this tour to anyone who wish to visit turkey and see both sides of the picture."

We were met right on time by our guide, Canero (who said we could call him John), and two other travelers who were in our group. Canero led us through the hippodrome and on the way to the family's house explained in great detail the history and significance of each statue there. Dinner was with a sweet Turkish family who spoke no English, but with Canero's help we were able to have a great evening with lots of laughs. The food was simple and tasty and included two different soups, a stew, rice, homemade bread, and tea. Canero explained everything in detail to us, including the ingredients of each dish,and the fact that it was traditional cuisine from the family's region in Turkey. He answered all of our questions and was incredibly charming and personable. I feel that he really tried his hardest to make sure that we all had a great experience. After dinner he took us to a local tea house for nargile, where he again did everything possible to make us feel at ease and have a good time. For me it was a perfect introduction to Turkish culture and cuisine, and I felt much less overwhelmed with all of the new sights and sounds than if I had not done this tour. Istanbul is complete sensory overload, but I think doing something like this helped me to feel more comfortable with everything and to have fun. I highly recommend this experience, especially if you can arrange to have Canero as your guide!"

We met out in front of the Spice Market which was a bit difficult to find, but thankfully he was wearing a bright red shirt with the company name on it, so we spotted him easily.We went on a Saturday (in low season) and the market was jam packed, I am nervous to see this market in high season!! It was very difficult to navigate the narrow market streets and keep us all together as everyone was sandwiched in with the locals all moving in different directions. That added to the fun of it though. At one point Semih told us that he have to be rude and push through, as this is what they all do.We were initially led through some of the backstreets and were taught what and where the locals ate. Our first tasting was fried anchovies which were fresh and delicious. We purchased some food there to have on our picnic later. Semih told us all about the local delicacies, which was great. We also got to try a very local treat of tomato and garbanzo balls wrapped in lettuce. That experience was hilarious as the owner is a bit crazy. All part of the charm. Our favorite stop was at the Turkish delight, tea & spice shop. You will never look at Turkish delights the same again. We loved the pomegranate, ginger & lemon delights!!Our picnic in the park was lovely where we had the flatbread with spinach and potato, cheese, desserts, along with their local yogurt drink (which is salted!). For the price I highly recommend this tour, it was fun, delicious and educational. Plus Semih even helped us locate a place where we could purchase our bus tickets to Bulgaria, he was so helpful.You won't be disappointed, it is a wonderful tour!"

Oooh, and we smoked shisha there, too. :) We all went back to this cafe next day because it is so near the tourist areas, but so peaceful and nice, but impossible to find out about if you don't know it...Then we walked around different neighborhoods where the guide was telling us a lot of stories and explaining about some sights, buildings but history and culture as well to finally arrive to our dinner place - highlights among the highlights :DWhat I loved about the whole thing that it is two way exchange - it is just not they serving you a meal, but we ate together which was an amazing interaction and great practice of your body language to communicate to them because they do not speak much english. Maybe this is what makes it even more precious experience. It's actually very simple to communicate if you let yourself being led by positive energy and feelings. It seems like this visits have a great impact on the family (not financially) but it brings much much more into their world too. The guide was translating everything, so we were able to have conversation and ask many question as the family did as well. Especially kids, who were also trying a lot to learn some english words and also thought us some games to play. This people open their hearts and let strangers come to their home, but when you leave, you're certainly not a stranger to them anymore(if you let yourself, of course :))Local guide, Semih was fantastic too. He was so knowledgeable, funny and entertaining that it felt more like having a friend showing you the town (and sharing his secrets) than being on a tour, which was my favorite. :) He is able to talk as much about history (if you are interested) or just the everyday life and all the random questions people from our group had about Istanbul and turkish culture. Just try to beet him in Tavle (backgammon)!And I am sure, some day when back in Istanbul, I will pay a visit to this wonderful family :)"

All the food was great. Semih translated for us, which was really helpful. We then went to a local hookah bar to try a hookah and play some backgammon. The hookah bar had a nice view of the Bosphorus and we chatted and played for about an hour and a half if memory serves right. This was a lot of fun too, capped off a great night.I learned later that the tour is there for the benefit of the families that cooked the meals and let us spend time with them for the evening, which is really wonderful.

Highlight was the small meatball vendor down a side alley that has a very unique style when it comes to serving his customers!From there we walked to the park outside of Topkapi Palace and enjoyed the foods Semih had purchased during the tour and had a great chat about life in Instanbul and Australia (very much a two way conversation and learning experience).The whole tour was relaxed and very informative - I'd definitely recommend it anyone."

I had never visited Taksim Square or even the other side of the bridge! I had a wonderful tour with Semih, he is very knowledgeable and also passionate about the city. He is a very friendly and happy to answer questions and help with photos as i was a solo traveller! I had an interesting experience getting fortune told from coffee, The info this guy can tell you about yourself is very surprising. One thing is already correct he told me regarding a friend of mines sex of her baby......who knows if he has a gift?A great tour and highly recommend it."

We would never had an opportunity to see this side of Istanbul without this evening. Lots of people travel to Istanbul to see the sites, missing the opportunity to get exposure to the culture. The host family opened their door to us, so it was great to get some insight into their way of live. A very friendly family, the kids are adorable! Would definitely recommend this tour if you want to experience a bit of \"real life\" in Istanbul. 5 stars!!We also got to learn how to play backgammon... which followed us throughout the rest of our trip :)A wonderful eveningthanks again!"

We then proceeded on the tram to Beyoglu with introduction to Taksim Square and a great walk down Istiklal Cadessi, where many locals hang out. Semih has a lot of information on this area and it was great to walk around and about thru the small side streets that branch off of Istiklal Cadessi. This was particularly helpful to me as I returned several times to walk around and enjoyed lunch at a restaurant (not listed, not even a sign outside, and an elevator ride up to the top floor of this building on a small side street - nice to do something that is a little hidden and unknown) recommended by Semih. Oh, and there was a fun Tarot Card/coffee ground reading, off on a side street - a good respite from the walking. Semih is personable and patient, knowledgeable and is an example of 'new Istanbul'. When I return I will definitely take another Istanbul Urban Adventure tour!"

One of the most memorable moments of this week-long trip was the night of September 6th when we visited a Turkish family and had a GREAT meal with them. The food was simply delicious!!! There was enough food for you to have a second serving. I sure took advantage of that opportunity.The family was lovely. We were allowed to asked questions and they were answered honestly. The children were a pure delight.Semih and his partner were wonderful tour guides. They helped to translate, but one of the little girls was able to practice her English on us. She was pretty good considering she is just learning how to speak it.After dinner, Semih took us to a local cafe where we drank tea, used a shisha pipe and played backgammon. There is no need to worry if you don't know how to play backgammon, Semih is a wonderful teacher.We are in our fifties and the other couple was much younger than us, probably in their late twenties. They too had a great time.If you visit Instanbul, this is a MUST tour to take. It's inexpensive and trust me when I say that you will love every minute of it!!!BRAVO to whomever came up with the idea to create such a tour!!!"

By far the best experience of our entire trip was spending the evening with Semih and our host family sharing a dinner, talking (with Semih providing interpretation), and wandering through one of the neighbourhood's around the Little Ayasofya. I enjoy travel, but haven't done alot of it, and what I like most is being able to spend some time in one place, walk it's streets, start to feel it's bones and get even a small sense of what the place may really be like. Try to form some kind of connection. With a cruise providing you maybe a day in any port this is incredibly difficult to do, however this evening really made that happen for me, and I think my kids.The original itinerary called for going to a family home for dinner and then out to a tea shop for tea, backgammon and waterpipe. As it was Ramadan the order was reversed so that, after meeting at the Urban Adventures office near the Hippodrome, we proceded to a tea house, with Semih providing us with lots of information along the way, both historical and current. We arrived at the tea house where we sat, enjoyed tea, smoked from the water pipes and learned to play backgammon. A very relaxing start to the evening, and a lot of fun. From there we went to our host families home for dinner, learning along the way from Semih abit about the community, and current day Istanbul and Turkey. We were greated warmly by the host family, her children, neighbour, and neighbours children. We were brought into their home and seated in a common area and chatted for a bit and then the best food of the entire trip was served and we all enjoyed our dinner together while continuing to ask and answer questions. Semih had told us that any question was an okay question, so it lead to a great conversation and the opportunity for myself and my kids to learn a little about life in Turkey. Dinner was concluded with tea, and after a bit more conversation we said our farewells, having already, very sincerely been told that we were welcome to visit them any time. Amazing. From there we were back out into the night and Semih very happily got us on our tram and headed in the right direction. He happened to be going the same way so we continued to chat and he made sure we didn't miss our stop. Truly an incredible experience and opportunity that I would recommend to anyone wanting to really get a taste of this marvelous city. Thanks Semih."

Day 2 was spent ostensibly in the New City (around Taksim) and included a walk through Taksim Square, the beautiful Art Deco Passages, a visit to a Turkish Hammam (never to be forgotten), an optional trip to a fortune teller and museum visits.My guide was Semih Onerbay - whom I can't rate highly enough! He was very affable, easy going, adaptable and has superb English language skills. It felt more like hanging out with a friend who had indepth local knowledge rather than a stiff formal guide. As it turned out, despite booking a small group tour, it was essentially Semih and I on our own for the two days. Although all the main sites were covered, Semih was flexible in his approach and gave choices of what to do next, which beats being frogmarched around a city by a guide any day! Semih has extensive knowledge on both the history and geography of this amazing cities evolution - there wasn't a single question he couldn't answer.Highlights - The dinner with a local family, the mosaic's at Topkapi Palace, the Hammam experience and the Art Deco Passages in the New City. A really worthwhile trip and a great way to see the city if you only have a few days! Highly recommended."

Semih, our guide for the day was knowledgable, friendly and and kept the tour interesting at all times. I did the modern Istanbul tour through the taksim area discovering the hidden secrets of the now popular shopping district including stopping at a local coffee house for Turkish coffee with fortune telling through the coffee reading. After this we did another tour option of a home stay dinner with a local family. I could not recommend this more highly. We had dinner at a local family,s house with them and their children. While they didn't speak any English, and we had no Turkish, semih wasa fantastic intermediary. To be included in a normal family dinner here was something I will never forget plus it helps support a local family. We were so impressed the next day we joined semih again for a street food picnic, buying our food from street stalls in and around ther spice market before sitting to a lovely picnic in the park. Thank you semih so much for introducing me to Istanbul, I will definitely be back."

Additionally, it included a delicious dinner with a local family (they didn't speak English, but Semih interpreted and they were very engaged and friendly including their children); a tour of the Taksim Square, Istikal Caddesi, and the Tepebasi and Beyoglu neighborhoods; a traditional \"full treatment\" Turkish Bath at the historic (and very clean) Galatasaray Hamami (full treatment includes sauna, wash, massage, loofah scrub, and shower); and a picnic in the park behind Topkapi Palace, preceded by a tour of the spice and local markets learning about and buying our picnic foods. Semih was highly knowledgeable and engaging. Although this adventure was packed with the above activities, it never seemed rushed. As an extra bonus, Semih took us to the Archaeology Museum, which has some amazing artifacts, including the oldest love poem ever found (written on a stone tablet over 4,000 years ago), and some parts of the Gates of Ishtar from Babylon. Ask for Semih when you sign up for this Istanbul adventure."

I'd heard that people have been recommending Istanbul for sight seeing for about 10,000 years, but didn't really appreciate the reason until now. I do not have sufficient power over the English language to fairly describe my experience in Istanbul during the last month. The place is absolutely enchanting. Urban Adventures guide Semih Onerbay ensured that it was all the more so by learning my interests and taking me places I could not have otherwise found. Semih graciously attended to us beyond the call of duty taking extra care of us and spoiling us. He met us for an extra day without charge to lead us to historical sights we'd added to our list at the end of the trip."

A guide with intimate knowledge of the city, a beautiful family to share dinner(and laughs) with and throughout you can ask tons of questions feeling perfectly relaxed covering all topics. I could have drank after-dinner tea with our host family all night.Tour of The Blue Mosque, followed by meeting the family for dinner, tea, back streets, visit to Little Haghia Sophia and then on to enjoy a nargile and a lesson in backgammon overlooking The Bosphorous. What more could you ask for? Well, winning more than one backgammon game would have ended it beautifully but I wouldn't change a thing. If you're a social, interested person you just have to do it. Thanks again Semih, Sarah, Mohammed and the rest of the family!"

Our guide, Semih, made us feel like he was a friend showing us around rather than a guide following a script, and we really felt that we saw secret bits of Istanbul that other tours miss out.The best part of the tour was that we got to Aya Sophia before any of the cruise tours, and our guide knew an old entrance that was no longer in use, so our first glimpse of the most famous attraction in the city was completely people-free. Inside he pointed our various little quirks and nooks that other people and guides were blithely walking past.We also visited a couple of lesser known, but equally beautiful mosques - one was even bluer than the Blue Mosque inside, and without the crowds. We covered all the major attractions of Sultanahmed and got to see some extras like the university and bazaars, before having a nice turkish tea in a sunken courtyard.It was refreshing to have a guide that spoke to us like human beings, not from a script, and give new light on a city that is seen by so many. If you want to see all the sights of Istanbul while avoiding the crowds as best you can then do not hesitate in booking this tour."

However the whole evening was made very enjoyable and enlightening thanks to our excellent guide - Salih Cam. Once we got to the 'popular hangout' and learnt to play backgammon then the discussions between Salih and ourselves became very interesting and we learnt a lot about modern day life in Istanbul - if only through the eyes of one observant person. Salih's only restriction was his lack of knowledge of life outside his own country - but that unfortunately is a 'perhaps inevitable' failing of guides in whatever country we have used them. We would recommend anyone to ask for Salih as a guide."

Then it was on to a cafe for tea and backgammon. There was also the opportunity to try a hookah pipe, but I had done that elsewhere so passed on that. The cafe was great. Only disappointment was that Salih beat me at backgammon ( but I did give him a good run for his money). Salih was great company and we had a very good discussion about Turkey and its culture and society."

As the group was small we were able to ask loads of questions, all of which he answered in detail.It was really useful to be accompanied by a local to the mosques, as we wouldn't have been comfortable about knowing the etiquette etc had we gone on our own.The sunken cafe is a hidden treasure that we would never have known about if we hadn't be shown, and we went back again on another day as we liked it so much.I would recommend doing this tour on your first in Istanbul, to get a feel for the place and avoid doubling up on anything as it covers some of the main tourist attractions (as well as some that you may not visit otherwise).Thank you Salid for a great tour, I would recommend it to anyone."

Salih was the perfect host and guide to help us engage with the markets, the mosques, the vendors and the people of Istanbul. His love of his culture, his knowledge of the history of Turkey, and his appreciation for the diversity of the city made this tour personal and fascinating. Salih was generous with his time, answered our many questions and invited us to join him over his lunch at a local spot we would never have discovered on our own. His time with us greatly enhanced our appreciation of the sights, sounds and tastes of Istanbul. Thank you Salih for your generous spirit."

We were very grateful that Salih and the other four people on the tour waited patiently for us when we were 20 mins late arriving, due to having set off walking to the meeting point in completely the wrong direction! The tour ended up being nearly 5 hours long and covered a huge range of the old city from some of the main sights such as Blue Mosque and the Grand Bazaar to more hidden areas like the Book Bazaar and some winding back streets leading to a local mosque. We stopped for Turkish tea in a sunken courtyard cafe, ate Turkish delight at the Spice bazaar and had a simit from a street seller. At the end of the tour Salih even invited us to have lunch with him at a local cafe. As well as being a great introduction to the city we also learnt lots about Turkish culture and society and about Islam from Salih who was friendly and chatty and happy to answer any of our questions. Would definitely recommend the Hidden Istanbul tour and Salih himself."

We had a lovely meal with a Turkish family in the Home Cooked tour.The family was friendly but a bit shy when it came to conversation. Salih however encouraged us to ask questions about themselves and translated for us so we managed ot make some conversation. The real highlight of this tour was going to a cafe to drink tea, smoke narghile and learn how to play Backgamon. The Istanbul Old and New tour took us around Taksim where we visited several churches, learned about the the Turkish football team Galatasaray, and had our fortune read from our coffee cups.

Having a guided tour in such a small group definitely is an unforgettabe experience (and I did not envy any members of the many large groups we met on our way... ;-)) and I can only recommend it to people travelling on their own or in couple/small groups. The guide was very friendly and attentive and seamed to be very competent as well as committed to his job. There was plenty of information on history as well as on living in Istanbul today. And there was enough room and opportunity for our questions. I was also very glad that we started early, 08:30, because that allowed for some really special uncrowded moments even at the big sights. Some parts of the walk actully were less \"hidden\" than others, as other commentators have remarked, - but then I had studied the offer of the tour beforehand and decided that this was what I wanted to see. So no problem here!Thank you, Salih, for a great time and for a well chosen mix of prominent sights and special places! Whenever I will be visiting Istanbul again I will gladly book one of the other guided tours that are offered."

It was such a humbling experience to feel so welcome in their home. Over a delicious dinner of rice, soup, chicken, and vegetables, I learned more about Turkey in such a short amount of time than I learned about my own homeland in 23 years. Afterwards, we went to a tea cafe for hookah (nargile) and I learned how to play backgammon. Quite possibly one of the best evenings during my stay in Istanbul.The best way to get to know a place is through its people, and this tour is a great inside look into the life of locals.

However, those thoughts were immediately put to rest after meeting our guide Salih. Salih is a young energetic tour guide from Turkey who is very knowledgeable and passionate about Istanbul. The tour started by getting a quick history of Istanbul and learning some unique facts, which were much more interesting than the \"on your right you can see...\" tours. After that we strolled through the more residential area of Sultanahmet while kids played in the street and the neighborly families congregated together to talk about the day. After several confusing turns, which is very common in Istanbul, we came to an apartment building where we were to meet the Turkish family for dinner. We made the climb up a couple floors and arrived at their apartment. We were immediately met with smiles and laughter from the Turkish family. The wife, her two kids, and her sister were there for dinner, her husband, unfortunately, was at work. We had to talk through Salih to the family whom spoke no English, but this proved to be quite amusing at times because English, obviously, was not Salih's first language. We sat on the floor to eat dinner which is traditional in Turkey and talked and laughed our way through each course. We were very happy to get along with the Turkish family and did our best to banish the media's portrayal of American's.After we finished dinner and our fun conversations, we left their home and made our way to a nargile cafe. The cafe was called The Marmara Cafe and was located very well in Sultanahmet in relation to the Marmara Sea. The cafe was decorated in the Ottoman empire style, which is common throughout Sultanahmet, and large oriental rugs draped from the walls and ceilings. However, the best attraction was the back porch, which gave one of the best views of the Marmara Sea in Istanbul. Salih got us a table, order us some tea, a nargile pipe (hookah), and backgammon. For the rest of the night we laughed and drank tea and smoked flavored nargile and learned backgammon until were were deemed novices. I would highly recommend this tour to anyone. If you only have time to do one thing in Istanbul, do this tour! Its the best way to get acclimated with the city and get immersed into the culture."

Luckily Salih had waited for us!I wouldn't really call this tour 'hidden' - you see the major sights and maybe a mosque you might not otherwise visit, but you don't really get an 'insider's perspective' on the city."

One thing I need to aknowledge first of all is their great customer service: we forgot to confirm 24 hours ago as required on our voucher and they were very accomodating and offered to reschedule our tour for the next day.Now about our tour: the \"home-cooked Istanbul\" tour. There were two parts to our Urban Adventure experience: first a guided tour of a few monuments in Istanbul (Hippodrom, Little Aya Sofia), then a home-cooked dinner with an Istanbul family and our guide as a translator, followed by a drink at a water pipe caf\u00e9.The second part was by far the most interesting as it offered a good way of entering a typical and average Istanbul family home as well as sharing a meal and interacting with them.However we were very disappointed by the first part as we found out our guide didn't have a great command of historical facts (we found later through several of ours readings that a few of the historical information he gave us while commenting the monuments or answering our questions were wrong).As a takeaway, I'd say Urban Adventure is great for people who are looking for a way to interact with locals and chat with a local guide, but I wouldn't recommend it for people interested in historical facts and knowledge."

Every guidebook, podcast and article I had read before the trip lectured on the importance of meeting the locals whilst in Istanbul but often it isn't that easy. This tour provided an easy way to have a really unique experience which you couldn't possibly arrange any other way if you were only in the city for a few days. We were welcomed into a Kurdish Turkish families home for an evening meal and tea with our excellant guide acting as an intermediary translating our questions and comments allowing a real conversation to happen. It was a really relaxed and friendly evening and I would recommend it to anyone visiting Istanbul that wants to stray a little bit off the tourist track."

Istanbul where you can find life in every corner and even in the greatest trouble you can find calmness and peace... Our tour leader SALIH made it perfect, he did a wonderful job! We were all amazed about his knowledge. Thanks again for letting us know more about life & history and for getting in touch with it's culture ,what i haven't experienced liked that yet!

Don\u2019t waste your time and money with this tour!But let\u2019s start at the beginning: The booking and E-mail conversation before the trip was very good and prompt. Our group on Saturday afternoon was just 3 people and the guide. So far so good, but then came our guide\u2026.She, I forgot her name, was completely unmotivated!!! First sentence e was that she is quite tired as she just came back from her morning tour. She just walked with us through the city and spoke a little bit while walking, which was also with only 3 people around her impossible to hear. The only informative stop of more than 3 minutes was at Galatasaray Square.Just one example from our tour: We were just walking down a street in Taksim, she showed us that there was a catholic church in an inner courtyard. We asked if it is worth a visit from inside. Here answer was: \u201cIf you want just go in. I was there already several times!\u201d EH?!? At the end we felt that we would have seen much more, if we would have explored Taksim by our own. Really, never in my life I had such a bad guided tour!!!"

He was particularly effusive about the extraordinary Hagia Sophia (the \"maestro in Istanbul's orchestra\"). It was particularly great to have him accompany us there as there is very little information on plaques or otherwise so we would have missed so much had we been on our own. Worth noting also that both the Aya and the Cistern are museums and Rasim has priority at the queues which is another massive plus in this tour's favour.All in all we spent three and a half hours on the tour which was excellent value and Rasim's enthusiasm and knowledge continued from the first minute to the last."

Although we could have seen the sites on our own , our guide added information that we could not have picked up. This greatly enhanced the trip for us, particularly in the Hagia Sophia and the Blue Mosque."

Well worth while. Thanks Razim."

Rasims' knowledge was incredible! There was never a question he couldn't answer and all four of us thoroughly enjoyed the day! It's advisable for women to carry a scarf to cover their heads and have their knees and shoulders covered when visiting Blue Mosque."

I was planning a visit to Istanbul and contacted Rasim in regard to helping us with touring options. Rasim was very responsive and provided us with a suggested three day itinerary in Istanbul with the possibility of two side trips - Ephesus and Cappadocia. We corresponded via email and decided on two full days in Istanbul (covering all of the major sights, Hippodrome, Ayasofia, Topkapi Palace, Blue Mosque, Grand Bazaar, Spice Market, Dolmabahce Palace, The Cistern, Subway in second oldest tunnel in the world, Suleyman Mosque, etc. it was a huge amount to see in two days. But we were able to fit it all in (and more). Rasim took care of all of the tickets, picked us up at the hotel in a beautiful chauffeured van and took us back each evening. He lucked several historic restaurants for us to dine in and provided information on everything to do with Istanbul. We also took a Bosphorous Boat Tour (fantastic). Rasim is very knowledgeable of all of Istanbul's history and very interested in helping people learn. Rasim met us upon our arrival at Ataturk Airport with a transfer can to the hotel (invaluable as it was 1 am in the morning - and even better with a box of Turkish Delight in hand as a welcome gift). Rasim also arranged all of our transfer to Kayseri (transfer from hotel to airport, airline tickets and transfer from Kayseri Airport to our hotel (and back) - as well as a wonderful guide, Hande, who he partners with in Cappadocia. We had a full days tour with her of many sights in Cappadoccia. Wonderful experience. Rasim is very knowledgeable, accommodating and interested in his clients having a wonderful experience on their visit to Turkey. There are a few \"secret\" panaorana sights he may take you to which are really unbelievable!Once we picked our dates and sights to be seen he took care of everything else and for what I believe was a very reasonable fee."

Rasim is also a proud Turk who seems to have the history of Turkey in his blood.After we parted company with him we realised that he was exactly what we needed for following days visit to the TopKapi museum. We emailed Rasim who agreed to meet us. He turned up with per ought tickets and eased our way into the museum, he again gave us an incredible insight into the world of the Ottomans.Rasim is also good company and a charming young man, on the day of our Topkapi visit he had just bought his first house we wish him luck and heartily recccomendations him as a guide to Istanbul antiquities."

I've found out he's a tour guide taking a break and he offered me a mini free tour of Aya Sofia. It was really nice of him that he chose to spend his break like that instead on coffee or tea, as he said :) I'm a fine art student, so it was a big plus for me that he focused on mosaics first, but he really mentioned most of the important sights of this grandiose basilica/mosque/museum, which made my visit far more interesting. All the best regards from Serbia :)"

I found him very flexible and was able to adapt to my changing requirements quickly and took me to places I wanted. He was warm ,hospitable and honest.He spent in Lira for me and kept a clean account. He helped me with my bags ,took me to a classic hamam ,and we had lunch together in a street side restaurant.I would recommend him and his services to any one. Rasim will do even better if he improved his English."

He truly gave us a \"behind-the-scenes\" look at Istanbul, including taking us through an old neighborhood and onto the rooftop of a building (literally) for a great view in the city! He's also a \"foodie\" and shared his love for food with us by taking us to several of his favorite local places (for fresh Turkish Delight, homemade ice cream and a great Turkish lunch). The day felt like it was spent with a warm family friend, rather than with some of the bored, \"canned\" guides we've been stuck with in the past. Rasim not only helped us with some shopping missions while we were in town, but he also went to a store THREE TIMES after we were back in the States to help us deal with some problems we had with a lamp we bought!! That's what I call going above and beyond! He'll be the first we call when we're planning to return to Turkey."

The tour ended up being closer to an hour. It was a great experience. Rasim provided a well planned tour with excellent background information. We would not have spent as much time or enjoyed our visit as much if we had just toured through on our own. Later that evening we decided to go to the Topkapi palace the next morning. I emailed Rasim asking him if he was available to take us on a tour of the palace. Luckily, he was available. He took us on a 2.5 hour tour of the palace including the Harem. Again, we were very pleased with the insight that he provided into Ottoman cultural traditions, area history and the palace itself. Money well spent!"

However, he was not very energetic at all. He also just grazed the surface of every description of all locations. We could have easily gotten the same info from a basic guide book. It just wasn't very exciting at all and no one was impressed with his tour. Pros: no wait it lines, everything was organized for us, and we essentially made our own schedule and went at our own paceCons: you pay money for a mediocre tour, I would have rather paid more for a guide who is fun and very knowledgeable. Rasim got several facts wrong, we questioned him on them, and he changed the story. This simply should not happen from an experienced tour guide.I am not quite sure why everyone else had such great reviews... perhaps we wanted a more in depth tour than others? Perhaps he had an 'off' day? I would give a 2 our of 5 for the quality of the tour, but bumped it up to a 3 out of 5 since Rasim was nice."

He was very prompt in answering my email enquiries and also very helpful with letting me know in advance what the weather forecast was so my family and I were prepared with umbrellas, and with tweaking my proposed itinerary so that it made the most sense. Rasim also sent me a reminder about bringing my youngest child's passport to ensure she had a reduced entry ticket fee for some of the major sites -- I'm sure I would not have remembered that without the reminder! He was easygoing about the currency we paid in which also made it simple for us.We visited the Topkapi Palace and Hagia Sofia the first day. Rasim was very knowledgeable about their history and was sure to point out important aspects of both, and also gave us time at our own pace to enjoy the sites. (Don't miss either of these sites - they were definitely the highlights of Istanbul for me.) He was interested in any questions we had, and if he didn't know the answer was not afraid to say so - and he also followed up with an email for me later with some information that he had discovered. As another reviewer mentioned, he avoided long lines by timing our entries as well.The second day we visited the Blue Mosque, the underground cistern (my 16 year old son's highlight, and as we were quite interested in these cisterns Rasim detoured to show us a few more!), the hippodrome, the university, Suleymaniye Mosque, a few views of the ancient aqueduct, and finally the Grand Bazaar.Rasim recommended two GREAT and affordable restaurants with terrific atmosphere for us for lunch - Seyhmuz Kebap Evi and Sultanahmet Koftecisi. He also brought us to his favorite ice cream place - where we returned again later that afternoon!"

The best part was since he has so much experience dealing with the tourist population, he actually reversed our tour to what people normally do. By doing this we avoided standing in long lines and got into sites that are difficult to navigate when crowded (the Palace), before the crowds. He also had tickets ready for us so we didn't have to stand in line for those and then stand in line AGAIN for admittance. He saved us many hours of idle waste. The lines for the museums can be very long. We were in Istanbul over the Easter week, so naturally it was crowded. Still we got to see all the sites and had a wonderful day! Try to get Rasim!"

We went to all the sights and were impressed by the knowledge and passion Rasim has for his city and the history surrounding it. It was great having our own vehicle and we were able to beat most of the crowds from the cruise. Rasim also took us to a great restaurant for authentic Turkish cuisine.Due to the ship being late arriving in Istanbul, our planned tours had to be modified. Rasim was great in accommodating all that my wife and I wanted to do in order for us to get the most out of the tour-he also made sure that we beat the Istanbul rush-hour traffic to arrive at our ship on time.Also, as a side note, Rasim contacted us when we arrived home to make sure that we had received our lost luggage.

Tucked away off the major tourist center of Sultanahmet, the Kucuk Ayasofya Camii (Little Ayasofya Mosque) is about a 7-8 minute walk from the main square. Built by Justinian in the 6th century, it is said to be the prototype for the much-larger Aya Sofia in Sultanahmet Square.The 7-8 minute walk will take you along well-traveled streets lined with a mix of shops and restaurants catering to both tourists and locals, and a few hotels.It was converted (as the Aya Sofia was) to a mosque after Constantinople fell to Mehmet the Conquerer in 1453. Kucuk Ayasofya is a working mosque; women are required to dress appropriately with headscarves; shoes are removed in the little alcove just inside the entrance - there's a convenient cubby-hole system along one wall to place your shoes until you are ready to leave. You'll see an older ablution fountain with a (non-working) hand pump on the inside - the current washing fountains are outside the structure in the courtyard.Elements of when the Greeks held the city are evident in the 'Greek key' architectural details, and you can climb the short flight of stairs to a platform and overlook the interior. Not many tourists, therefore very peaceful inside. Shades of cream and blue abound, and the interior design work of carvings, tiles, and paintings are not as overwhelming as some of the larger mosques. The cream and blue colors reminded us of Greece; as this was a Greek church for centuries, perhaps this is color scheme was an intentional choice.We can't say for certain if there was an entrance fee - we were so taken in by how lovely the mosque is - we recall leaving a 10 TL each donation (as of June 2016, ~$3.42), but due to our limited understanding of Turkish were not sure if that was an entrance fee or not.In many ways, we found Kucuk Ayasofya more beautiful than the better-known Aya Sofia because it is smaller, much less crowded, and it you can get much closer to see the beautiful tilework and architectural details. And, as long as there are no prayer services, you can sit as long as you like and enjoy the serenity."

This is so like a small version of Aya Sofya, it was an obvious name to adopt ('kucuk' meaning small) and obvious that a story would develop that it was a model for the actual Aya Sofya. It is a beautiful example of a 6th century church, dedicated to 2 Christian Roman soldiers, although all the Byzantine mosaics and frescos were removed in the 16th century when it was converted into an Ottoman mosque. But the beautiful pillars and their intricately carved capitals, and the Greek friezes above them were left undamaged, either by the Ottomans or the more recent renovations. Although technically a museum since the Republic was formed in 1922, it seems to have again become a mosque after renovation, meaning ladies must now cover up and making viewing tricky on a Friday But definitely worth a visit. Make sure you go upstairs (but be careful on worn steps)."

Because the \u201cLittle Hagia Sophia,\u201d as it is known, retains the architectural features of the original church, it struck us as an example of the Ottoman practice of re-purposing Christian religious structures, often whitewashing over mosaics and frescoes, rather than tearing churches down to build mosques.

We were not disappointed. This beautifully proportioned space is decorated minimally compared to the bigger and more visited attractions and is all the more appealing (and more refreshing) for that. The many fewer visitors allow the reasonable chance of photos without the intrusion of the human figure and the possibility to roam all over the building, to the gallery, to the top of the added enclosure etc which allows many viewpoints such that you start to notice things like the edges of vertical surfaces that are sculpted and decorated to look like drawn-back curtains and the fact that the building is not quite true on its axis. The intimacy of the smaller space and the more restrained decoration soon made us warm to this building; maybe we felt it as a bit more European than Eastern, a bit more retaining of its Christian heritage despite its conversion to a mosque? Outside there is almost a cloisters containing the ablutions station with retail outlets offering ceramics, glassware, literature, refreshments etc. and in the nearby streets are some interesting local artists working away in their studios and selling their art. After the hectic confusion and bustle of the larger monuments, this quiet and serene tucked-away jewel of a building is a tonic for wearying sight-seers"

If you like to walk among the near streets of Istanbul and you're looking for extra important historical sightseeing, you shouldn't miss the so-called Small Aya Sofia. It's situated in a peaceful part of Istanbul, away from crowded spaces and hords of tourists. You'll be given a chance to visit a significant historical place, an ex-church, converted to a mosque. Why do I say that the 'chance is given'? It's because it's completely opened to tourists, even though the Kucuk Ayasofya is still a regular mosque. The exterior and interior of the mosque are really interesting and amazing, so you won't regret visiting this place. Also, at the entrance of the mosque there are free prospects which are related to Islam (written in different languages). At the end of the Kucuk Ayasofya tour, you can take a pause and rest a bit in the shades of trees surrounding the mosque."

This building was a church for hundreds of years before conversion to a mosque.Its just as interesting as the larger ayasofya, as size isn't everything in my opinion.... ;-) but there are three things that make it more interesting:1. It's still being used for worship to this day.2. It's less crowded.3. It's free!My advice for this building and all the buildings of this amazing city:Join in... don't be shy.Wash you feet under the taps on the building opposite the main door outside to save the carpet. (Feet can get very swetty in istanbul. It won't kill you and it's actually really refreshing.)Go inside, forget tourism, put your camera in your pocket, then quietly sit on the carpet and contemplate your existence.You may take home something really special and get far more from your visit to Istanbul than just photos.That's has after all been the real purpose of all these beautiful buildings in Istanbul for thousands of years...."

Good travel books will probably drop a few lines about the existence of this much smaller church from the same period that now operates as a mosque. Little Ayasofia (k\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck ayasofia) is a much smaller temple but its interior is better conserved - you can look at the inscriptions in Greek. The church has an octogonal plan with beautiful columns and wall paintings, and a gallery that provides a great view from a different angle.It is interesting to see how the mirhab (the central piece where the faithful offer their prayers) had been built. Since the church was built without Mecca in mind and the mirhab has to be oriented towards Mecca, the solution was to place it off center.Little Ayasofia (k\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck ayasofia) is located in the Sultanahmed region but removed from the main attractions around its larger sister. No tour buses seem to stop there so you can enjoy a quiet visit. The blocks around the church are a nice place to walk and relax, away from the stressful movement of tourists and street vendors elsewhere."

We loved the hand printing shop - but right next door is a very special jewellery shop. It has the most unusual beautiful handmade jewellery and is not expensive. I bought the most precious ring there and everybody I have shown it to says it the most beautiful ring they have ever seen. I wish I had bought gifts for everyone there.

They apparently used some of their construction ideas on this church as a prototype before embarking on the huge Hagia Sophia project, so its worth seeing for that reason. It dates back to the 600 AD era, but is very well restored and is a fully functioning Mosque, so no traces of its early Christian heritage remain, unless you look closely at some of the carved lettering along the balcony edge, which are in Latin and Greek. Some bright spark had the idea of building a railway line in 1870 some two metres form the structure and the resulting vibrations almost destroyed it. But its all been strenghened and shored up and should survive another 1400 years."

A beautiful little building with an interesting dome, deeply carved tops to the capitals, and a frieze in Greek running above them. The former medrese is now converted into little workshops for artists, with rabbits and ducks in the courtyard, and there is a pleasant little cafe outside the entrance. Recommended. You can carry on to look at Constantine's sea walls, or find the equally charming Sokulu Mehmet Pasa mosque and relax on a bench in the small public park in Kadirga Liman Caddesi, which has a namazgah (open place of prayer), the only one in the city. We found all these thanks to \"Strolling through Istanbul\" by Freely & Sumner-Boyd, which was an excellent guide."

In the cloister area outside is the station where worshipers wash themselves before entering the mosque and a small cemetery. The inside of the mosque is tranquil and peaceful with beautiful windows and painted ceilings. The Imam was there to show people around and he insisted that we go upstairs to get a better look. The mosque is carpeted, but under the carpet you can feel the uneven stones that have been worn down over the centuries. After the crowds at other mosques and churches I had visited, this was a pleasant And meaningful interlude. There is no admission, but you will probably want to leave a donation to help with preservation. I highly recommend a visit!"

The only thing that bothers me about the \"restorations\" of mosques in Istanbul is that rather than maintaining the historic feel, they tend to repaint in a way that makes the interior look like it's fresh out of the box and a look at the pictures tells me it's happened here too.There's not an official fee but it's good to make a donation.The small madrassah across the way is a lovely quite place to have tea, enjoy the flowers and talk with people who practice and teach traditioal Ottoman crafts."

It was late in the afternoon and it was only me in the building. A very polite man, who was obviously looking after the mosque, invited me to get inside as I was not sure whether I was allowed to. I only had to take my shoes off (I was not asked to cover my head) and then to step inside. I was charmed by what I saw: it was an impressive mixture of two religious cultures. The building is a mosque now but the original architecture has survived remarkably well, not like the original interior decoration. It must have been a beautiful church \u2013 with the elegant two-storey colonnade and walls covered in golden mosaics (like those that survived from this period in Ravenna) and probably frescoes as well. The capitals of the marble columns are splendid and still bear the monograms of Justinian and Theodora. It was interesting to learn that this edifice is even older that one of the present museum Haghia Sophia. It was begun by Justinian and his Empress Theodora in 527, five years before the commencement of the building of Haghia Sofia itself. Likely, the Sains Sergius and Bacchus was a model for St Sophia. Today, it is also known as the Little Haghia Sophia because of its resemblance to the Great Church.SS. Sergius and Bacchus served as a church for nearly 1,000 years after its founding, but then in the first decade of the sixteenth century it was converted into a mosque. SS. Sergius and Bacchus were two Roman soldiers martyred for their espousal of Christianity. The saints were especially dear to Justinian because they saved his life some years before he came to the throne. It was my last day of our five days break in Istanbul and was really glad that I didn\u2019t miss seeing this church. It is just less than a 10 minutes\u2019 walk from the Hippodrome and 5 minutes from our Dara Hotel. The area, where the church is located, is residential and it\u2019s pretty nice to see how people live there. To me this church-mosque is one of the most charming architectural treasures in Istanbul."

From my own observations 1) a woman trying to enter wearing a hat will be turned back \u2013 a shawl or scarf is expected 2) shoes should be taken off before standing on the carpet at the entrance to the mosque \u2013 I saw visitors told off for not doing this. They had reasonably assumed that they only needed to be shoeless once past the door and the prohibition is not made explicitly clear in the mosques with less tourist traffic 3) taking off your shoes and carrying them in your hands is frowned upon (while carrying them in the plastic bags provided in the larger mosques is fine)."

We decided to visit the \"Little Hagia Sophia\" (so called because it was also built by Justinian, along similar lines to the Hagia Sophia) before visiting some of the larger and more famous buildings. It is certainly less spectacular than the Hagia Sophia, but it has something to offer for people who are interested in older buildings. Do not expect original Byzantine architecture, however, as it has been heavily modified over the centuries, most recently to brace it against the vibrations from the railroad which runs right next to the building.For one thing, it is far less crowded, and you can take your time examining the paintings which decorate the upper galleries without feeling pushed or rushed. Although we did not have a language in common, the caretaker ensured that we saw all public parts of the building, by inviting us to climb to the gallery when we otherwise wouldn't have done so.As with all active mosques, you need to take off your shoes before entering, and women are asked to wear a headscarf. There were headscarfs you could borrow just inside the door. There is no charge to visit."

This is one of the greatest treats that the city of Istanbul can offer...It's a quiet, loving, accepting place surrounded by coffee houses and artists' studios. It's the kind of site that allows for a special level of devotion and/or \"special pleading\"--like Gobekli Tepe in Mesopotamia, the Frick Museum in NYC, Santiago De Compostela, and Cerveceria Catalana (for the best tapas in the world) or Sta. Maria Del Mar in Barcelona.\"Kacuk Ayasofya\" was the church of St. Sergius and Bacchus, the Patron Saints of the Military (the Orthodox tradition) for over 1000 years and it is still a place of pilgrimage for Christians, Sufis, poets, and secular humanists--straight and gay--as well as a fully functioning mosque. To accommodate the change from church to mosque, the orientation of the minbar and qibla were shifted off-axis and the altar removed, but this does nothing to detract from the sanctity--or balancing energy--of the place.I should also not that down the street (on a side street, 5 minutes away) is a masterpiece from the great Sinan: the Sokollu Mehmet Pasa Camii, making this a one-two punch of sacred architecture in what is my favorite city in the world: first Hagia Sophia and the Blue Mosque (5 minutes up the hill), then lunch (at \"Cesme\" down the street) and the aforementioned duo of Sokollu Mehmet and Kacuk Ayasoya...followed by \"chai\" in the garden next door. There's a day with a taste of Heaven...It's one of my favorite places in the world. True to Rumi's motto, it is a place to \"Come--whoever you are, Come!\". For any tour of Istanbul, it should be a \"must see\" (and don't forget there's an upstairs area which is perfect for reading and reflection). Enjoy--it still has a great deal to teach us...PS: One of the reviewers below mistakenly suggests that there is a cover charge--there is for the Great Hagia Sophia up the hill (now a museum), but not for this lovely shrine--it is still a place of worship. This little wonder was begun 5 years before its better known neighbor. John Romer pays homage to this \"Camii\" in his wonderful 4-part documentary, BYZANTIUM: THE LOST EMPIRE. Watching that excellent series (on dvd) would give you more than enough information with which to visit this site without a guide and enhance your appreciate of the city as a whole."

An intricate frieze which is over 1400 years carved in Greek mentions The founders of the church.

The reason of our visit was Istanbul Shopping Fest, actually closing ceremony. Visiting Istanbul during the Shopping Festival (from July 1st to July 31) is a good choise - you can enyoing the shopping as well as the city :). Istanbul is amazing, there is beauty everywhere, and the tasty food in every corner. Of course, a period of 3 days isn't long enough for such big and beautiful city, but our tour guide Ozden really tried to show us as much he could: we visited Topkapi Palace, Blue Mosque, Hagia Sophia, Grand Bazaar, Spice Market, Istiklal Street, Galata etc. We also had an amazing Bosphorus Cruise Tour, and visited Asian side of the city. Of course, we visited several shopping malls, as Kanyon or Istinya. Shortly, everything is great in Istanbul!"

My sons and I really enjoyed the tone and pace of his stories- added so much more to the tour. It was a packed itinerary however each site was timed perfectly with plenty of time for private viewing and taking photos. It was my second day in Istanbul and feel the tour really helped me familiarise myself with this beautiful city and culture. Murat even took the time out to suggest restaurants to eat at and helped me with getting a card for the tram system. When travelling to Istanbul I was a little apprehensive considering the Syria situation however it is a very safe city and such a great shame that tourist are hesitating to travel here. My advice to anyone considering visiting Istanbul is to book it- you won't regret coming here! Do not be put off by the bad media press and ' scare mongering' - it's more safer then London ( and people are more friendlier :) ) .. Thank you Turkland Tours and Murat for providing an excellent service ."

I was in awe of his depth of knowledge and really enjoyed the tone and pace of his stories. It was our first day in the city and he really helped us understand Istanbul's hugely long and complex history. I know he was worried that he was giving us too much information but he wasn't - he balanced it just right and everything was so interesting. The tour programme was very busy with a lot to fit in but Yavuz also managed this really well so we managed to visit all the sites and didn't feel rushed at any of them. I was nervous that it was a lot to do in a day but am really glad I took the agency's advice as it worked out really well. It was so helpful to have a guide at each of the major sites and meant we found out so much more than would have been possible from the information onsite. We were completely exhausted at the end though!He was also really helpful in helping us plan our week. Other sites we should do and how to do them. Particularly his advice on which hamam and Bosphorus cruise to use and getting us set up with a public transport payment card was really helpful so we could make the most of our time in Istanbul. His customer service was great throughout the tour."

Despite, the cold, rain, sleet and occasional snow flurry, we were able to see the areas of old Istanbul's Christian quarter that we longed to see. Without the help of our guide and driver this would have been impossible to do in one day. The Galata tower and Chora Church were an absolute highlight, but simply walking through this district with our guide's extensive knowledge, commentary and enthusiasm, allowed us to make the most of our time in very enjoyable and fulfilling fashion. I highly recommend Turkland Tours for squeezing the essence out of your precious travel time. Definitely come equipped with comfortable walking shoes, camera and coat or umbrella in the colder months. Many thanks to our wonderful guide Evren and our driver for the day."

Not quite sure what to do on our last day in Istanbul, our independent guide Ugur suggested Turkland Travel's Culinary Tour. We are adventurous eaters but had read mixed reviews of culinary tours in many places. Nonetheless, we decided to give it a go. So glad that we did!Very ably led by Neslihan, we thoroughly enjoyed tasting many different foods from soups through to sweets, from breakfast through to main course. We also enjoyed hearing how foods are prepared, where they come from and Turkish dining customs. The program was excellent with sightseeing, walking through streets not normally on the tourist trail as well as the tasting. Enough exercise to make a little space for the next culinary treat. The time flew.Thanks to Ugur and Ibrahim for organising this for us at the last moment and special thanks to Neslihan for a most memorable day.Ray & Alanah"

Firstly Ibrahim was very responsive and it was extremely easy to set up the tour. Ibrahim also replied to all our questions promptly before we arrived at Istanbul. The tour itself is extremely detailed covering both roman and ottoman influence on this city. A lot of information is given but in an easily comprehensible form and in a way we can visualize mentally. History buffs will really love it. Both the guides answered our questions about history, religion, political life and social life (past & present) in Istanbul in great depth. It wasn't JUST a history tour. A lot of information was also given on architectures of ottoman empire and influence of Sinan. Guides also elaborated a lot on how history has shaped modern day Turkey. We were taken to a very good local restaurant serving good authentic Turkish food. It was pretty much all day tour starting at 8 and ending at about 5:25 with lots of walking and interesting conversations. Both guides were very jovial, informative. They gave us very good restaurant recommendations as well for the rest of our stay in Istanbul. Ample amount of time was spent at each historical landmark. I would highly recommend this private tour for any body visiting Istanbul who is eager to learn about history, architecture and political/social life in Istanbul"

The tour I thought was perfect, better than I could have imagined. It was exactly what I was looking for. Local foods that I wouldn't know where to go for or what it was and safe foods to eat. There was a lot of food to eat which was great. I love food and to just eat all the time. There was such a variety of different tastes in Istanbul it's crazy. It was also nice from all the other tours I was looking at because most of the other ones were only like 3-5 hours long but this was all day which was nice. If you love food this is a tour to do in Istanbul! Also got to see little history, inside of the Mosques and of the city. Got to see the city in a different way which wouldn't have been possible without the tour. I would definitely recommend this tour to everyone I know that goes to Istanbul. I truly enjoyed the day with Yavuz and please tell him thank you for everything."

We were taken care of from start to finish by Turkland Tours. From an easy pick up from a hectic Istanbul Airport to our arrival back at the airport on time. The guides provided by Turkland Tours were one of a kind with many years experience. We enjoyed our one on one visits to learn more about the culture of Turkey,its people and religion. A must do is the Hot Air Ballon ride in Cappadocia. It was breathtaking! We had Five Star treatment including wonderful hotels and good local food.

We visited Turkey over the Thanksgiving holidays and found it to be a fascinating country and culture with more biblical history than we expected. Our experience with Turkland Tours made the Trip effortless as Ibrahim did a fantastic job of choosing and booking hotels for us, making arrangements for transfers and arranging two very knowledgable, friendly tour guides. We went to Istanbul then to Cappadocia on the six day tour. Our hotels were first class in both cities, and Ibrahim even had both rooms upgraded without us even asking. In Cappadocia we stayed in a cave hotel that had just recently been completed. Our hotel in Istanbul was new and very modern within walking distance to Hagia Sophia and the Blue Mosque. Our guide in Istanbul, Murat, has been in the business for over 20 years and was very friendly and knowledgable, always open to answering questions about Islam and their culture. In Cappadocia Umut was our guide. He was also very friendly and knowledgable open to doing anything we wanted. We were sad to leave them both as they made us feel like family when we were with them.I would highly recommend Turkland Tours. Every detail was taken care of and Ibrahim gave us his personal cell number to call anytime day or night if we encountered a problem. We were a little reluctant to go to Turkey with all the news about Syria, but once we got there we felt completely safe and never felt insecure. We loved our experience, especially the hot air balloon in Cappadocia. Go to Turkey! It is a fascinating county. And use Turkland Tours. You will be glad you did."

My wife and I had a wonderful time and definitely enjoyed our visit to such a fabulous city, We can't stop talking about the sights, food, and people we encountered through out our two days touring. Tankut was an excellent guide and really helped us understand a lot about the Turkish culture from both an everyday life side of things to the religious side, to the government interaction. He was very knowledgeable about the history of Turkey and how it has changed through out the years. He was also able to take us to some great vantage points of the city that we would have never found on our own which was very cool. This was our first time with a tour guide and it went above and beyond our expectations.1) Customer Service -- Excellent. From the very beginning, when I first contacted Ibrahim, responses to emails and questions were timely and easy to understand. Working with Ibrahim on the itinerary was very easy. My wife and I appreciated Ibrahim personally looking into the couples Hamam Bath and making the reservation once he knew it was available. It's also worth mentioning that after our first day, Tankut called our hotel to make sure everything went well during the day and that we had arrived back as planned, which was very thoughtful and appreciated. Even when we made changes to the itinerary on the fly on the 2nd day, adjustments were made and everything went smooth.2) Tour Program -- Excellent. What may be cool, and not sure if this is even already in the works, is a program where if you like major tourist sites you do this program. If you are more into food you do this program, visiting local shops and restaurants with great food, or if you like shopping you do this. It may be easier for people to choose a program and alter accordingly than try and come up with everything they want to see on their own. But overall, where we went and the time spent at each location was fantastic.3) Guide -- Excellent. As mentioned previously, my wife and I had never done a tour of a city with a guide and weren't quite sure what to expect. Tankut was very personable and we were sad to say goodbye to him after only two days of touring. I really enjoyed our discussions surrounding politics and religion and as mentioned before, he really helped me understand the Turkish Culture and the people that make up such a vibrant, energetic city. He was able to explain things in a way that was easy to understand and relate back to our life. I would highly recommend Tankut to any of my friends traveling to Istanbul. 4) Transportation to and from each point of interest was fast, effective, and easy. My wife and I had no problems with how we got to where we were going and the drivers drove in a safe manner given the situations.Overall my wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay in Istanbul and a lot of that goes to Tankut and the itinerary Ibrahim's company put together, so thank you!!"

We emailed several of the top ten daily travel guides in Istanbul but Turkland travel was the first to get back to us- and the only one willing to customize our trip for us. We went on a Sunday and because the Grand Bazaar was closed we negotiated an alternate route to the Basilica Cistern (which is an absolute must see!) for a small price adjustment.Service was outstanding as mentioned- Ibrahim would email back promptly and we had the whole trip sorted out in just a couple of hours.Our guide himself (Ulash- sorry not sure of the spelling!) was everything you could want in a guide and more. Courteous, humorous and friendly- he seemed to know most of the other tour guides we would pass! Not only was he comfortable to be around but his knowledge was so impressive. He studied for five years at university including history of ancient societies- which showed in the way he seemlessly delivered the history of the sites we saw and could answer our questions of anything we asked.Forget the long lines- our guide got us through all our destinations with little or no queuing! We felt the envious stares of the queues that stretched two blocks as he led us straight to the entrance and through security with zero fuss- that was worth the price of the tour alone! But accompanied by the fascinating history lesson it was truly the best way to experience Istanbul."

I landed in Istanbul yesterday end of the day - it was closing of Ramadan - and tried the top agencies on Trip Advisor to organize a tour today knowing it was very short notice. I only had one day in town so really wanted to do it. Out of all the top agencies listed on TA, Turkland was the ONLY one that answered the phone and offered a tour customized for me (the group ones were sold out) and very promptly. Ibrahim was great in offering options, very fast in exchanging and finalizing the arrangements, and in providing an excellent service all the way with a personal touch. He asked me if I had any specific requests related to the tour, and I mentioned that I love history, culture, arts and a local, authentic experience when traveling. Ibrahim was very considerate making me feel very welcomed in my first time in Istanbul/Turkey. I just finished the tour and had a fantastic day. Murat - my guide - was everything I had asked/hoped for and much more. He is SO knowledgable - impressive education and cultural background - which was very unique and inspirational. He made me wanting to know, read more about diverse subjects related to the sightseeing spots, and certainly made me wanting to come back to Istanbul and Turkey again. He took me to a great authentic ottoman cuisine restaurant and a local tile shop (upon my request) and the whole experience was terrific (very different from some recent tours to other cities in the world recently). Net, planning to use both Turkland and Murat services a next time and already recommending to my friends. I highly recommend to everyone. "

            "review": "Nice overall tour of Istanbul. We rented a driver and car for the day for a very reasonable price. I believe the guide's name was Yousef, but he said it so fast and only once, that I did not really catch it. His English was good, knowledgeable and he is used to giving tours to Americans. He does not normally work for Turkland, actually does longer tours (21 days) but Turkland Tours asked him to take us around. He did a good job, but he was not passionate about the city and I don't think he really understood what we wanted...we wanted the not so touristy sites, which I did list out and we discussed. But we were done early and he just had us hang out at the spice market for extra time (not the most exciting place to hang out, but it is worth seeing). (I would give our tourguide 3 stars, he was nothing exceptional).I was very thankful that we were able to avoid the large crowds. We went to Dolmabahce (the last Turkish sultan's home), Hagia Sophia, Basilica Cistern, and the Spice Market (versus the Bazaar--same thing, just different, they run into each other). I had also hoped to get away from the touristy restaurants for lunch, but we were taken to one right up the street from the Hagia Sophia. It was good, just not off the beaten path.I did book this on short notice due to extenuating circumstances so all of the people recommended in these reviews were taken. That is not Turkland's fault, but mine. I am thankful that Turkland Tours decided to find someone rather than just say they could not help. For that I give an extra point."

We really appreciated all aspects of this, especially the personal attention upon arrival and during our time in Istanbul Tour Program and Guide - Excellent. Our guide (Emrah) was fantastic - great knowledge of all sites and we really felt like we learned a lot during our time with him....it was a really fun day with him and we would highly recommend taking a walking tour of the old part of Istanbul!

            "review": "Smooth Perfect Logistics - Superbly planned & executed by Ibrahim of Turkland!. When traveling solo, there are many concerns and especially if the trip has been planned impromptu, one is a bit nervous. So since Turkland was recommended by the place I was staying at - and that they were not just a random off-the-street travel agency but connected to my hostel, it made me feel comfortable to book through them. Through several discussions Ibrahim worked around my budget and time constraints patiently and came up with a workable plan. [Later I was told by others that such a low price is usually not possible - so I realise that he went out of his way to make my trip happen]From the moment I was picked up from the hostel to the moment I was dropped back I probably was transfered across several independent operators i.e. taxi service in Istanbul, airline, taxi service in Cappadocia, travel agent in Cappadocia, bus tour operator, hostel in Cappadocia and then finally the two taxi operators on the way back to Istanbul. The micromanaging required was quite extensive but the marvel is that not ONCE did I feel like there was no one in charge - not once did I feel nervous or worried. I know that had I booked independently, I would have been fatigued by having to make all the arrangements on the spot. But with Ibrahim & Turkland everything was smooth and perfect. I told others later that it felt like I was DHL parcel - barcoded and even though the package changes hands many many times, everyone knows exactly what to do with it! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"

We made requests and he counter-proposed with other interesting options. We were with our guide, Yavuz, for 2 days: the first and third days we were in Istanbul (sightseeing can be tiring, so taking a break and having a \u201cslow\u201d day in between is recommended). He has been a guide for 26 years and seems to know everyone in the city. And having a senior guide delivers benefits like easy access to everything.The first day was all on foot as our hotel was close to many of the top sights; the second day we were carted around in an air-conditioned van.Yavuz was special because he was so knowledgeable about the history and politics of Turkey and the region. We spent considerable time discussing the current middle east problems, as well. We can unreservedly recommend him and his delicious sense of humor."

We saw the main sights of the Hagia Sofia, Blue Mosque, Topkapi Palace, Basilica Cisterns and the Grand Bazaar. Being with a guide meant we didn't waste time in queues such as at the Cisterns and Esin altered our day's intended schedule to avoid an uncommonly long queue at the Blue Mosque in the morning (she was able to find out the mosque opening times by dialing and listening to a recorded message - something we wouldn't have known about!). Esin was able to provide us with the historical and social context of these places and tailored the information to our level of prior knowledge. She showed us some hidden eateries and spent time helping us to plan our visit (including very useful advice about public transport) and source some musical instruments. We felt very cared for and Esin was able to fill in the gaps left by the guidebooks, which can never give the amount of detail a person can during conversation. She helped us learn some more Turkish and by the end of the day I felt confident to find my way in and about Istanbul. She was exactly the kind of guide I had hoped for."

The tour guides provided by the company were also very good specially Mr G\u00f6ukhan who took us around in Cappadocia and Konya. He is very knowledgeable and extremely courteous. We were treated with great respect and love. He even gave my Dad an expensive Persian copy of the Masnavi by Rumi as a gift. When leaving Konya, he refused to leave the airport till he personally checked us in on our flight to Istanbul.  Mr Ibrahim kept on checking with us on every stage of our tour to make sure that we were comfortable and also made last-minute changes in our itinerary based on our request. We what are all highly impressed by the professionalism of Mr. Ibraham and his team. On our last day in Istanbul, Mr. Ibraham personally came to our hotel to make sure that we were satisfied with our tour.I will definitely recommend Turkland tours to all my friends and family that may want to visit Turkey in future."

In Istanbul, we spent two days touring with Elgiz, a fabulous tour guide who was extremely knowledgeable about the culture and history of the Old City. In Cappadocia, Ibrahim arranged for us go hot-air ballooning over lunar-like landscapes at sunrise (an experience not to be missed). He also arranged tours of the area which included visits to spectacular geological formations, ancient cave houses, churches and monasteries that are carved from volcanic deposits, and even an underground city. At Ephesus, we visited extraordinary Roman ruins in the company of yet another extremely knowledgeable and thoroughly charming tour guide (whose name, unfortunately I cannot remember).Ibrahim provided us with a detailed itinerary, including information about our domestic flights, airport and tour transportation. He made all the arrangements. Except for two days off that we had purposefully built into our trip to Turkey, we really didn\u2019t have to do anything \u2013 Ibrahim had arranged everything for us. Everything went exactly as planned. We had transportation to and from the airport and to various sites in Cappadocia and Ephesus; tours in every city. Everyone was always on time, or even a little early!We had a lot of personalized attention and not just in terms of the tours. But also, Ibrahim talked to us at each stop in our trip to be sure we were not having any problems and also met us on our last day to make sure we happy with his services. He doesn\u2019t need to be worried about that. My husband and I had and extraordinarily wonderful vacation. If we go back to Turkey, we for sure will make arrangements through Turkland Tours."

They helped us with all our arrangements in Istanbul and Cappadocia. They had good suggestions regarding what to see and how how to get the most out of the time spent there. All arrangements went exactly as planned. Hotels were great in terms of location and service. In addition to the major sites, you will also explore other parts of Istanbul to get a truer feel for the city. Because they are a small agency, they can give personalized service. All our arrangements were made through email. They were prompt and very helpful in responding to all our inquiries. I would highly recommend them to help you make the most of your visit to Turkey."

            "review": "Our Immersion into Turkey. Originally we contacted a US travel agent when planning our trip to Turkey. Big mistake. That agent wanted to put us in hotels we could find in the US and estimated a ridiculously expensive vacation that included no meals. We wanted a more affordable and more Turkish experience for our vacation. Luckily, we had friends who had visited Turkey. They recommended we contact Turkland Travel and they were right.Thanks to that recommendation, we spent 16 (affordable) days in four different regions (Istanbul, Cappadocia, Izmir and Bodrum) of this amazing country. Each region was different in weather, food, history and attitude. Sometimes we had private tours and sometimes we were in small groups. We were met by a driver at every airport. Breakfast was included with every hotel and every tour included lunch. Some guides were AMAZING and some were just OK, but that happens with all travel.In Istanbul we were provided with knowledgeable guides who explained the culture and history of the Old City and other days we leisurely self-explored neighborhoods near Taksim Square. In Cappadocia we stayed in a cave hotel, went hot-air ballooning over lunar-like landscapes at sunrise and visited an underground city. In Izmir we experienced Ephesus (but missed visiting Pamukkale which was our mistake); we were guided into the countryside and saw frescos in a cave from 6th century BC. We relaxed by the gorgeous Turquoise Coast in Bodrum before returning to Istanbul for a few more days. Turkland Travel is based in Istanbul, but Ozden has contacts in every region of Turkey we visited. When we did run into a problem, we called Ozden and he IMMEDIATELY (within 10 minutes) had someone there to get us back on our way. Knowing that he was reachable by phone anytime, for any reason, was a huge plus."

Both Ozden on Day 1 and Essin on Day 2 were full of information on the history as well as the current situation in Turkey. Not only did we do the standard sights, but we also did a cruise up the Bosphorous to a small town where we had an amazing fresh fish lunch. There is so much to see in Istanbul...the only way to do it is privately and with Turkland!"

We visited Istanbul with family and friends and engaged Turkland Tours during our stay. It was a really smart decision. Ozden was our guide and he is fluent in English, is very funny, and knows the history and interesting facts about Istanbul and its many sites. Plus, Turkland Tours gets you and your group to the front of the line at all the sites and this was some good given that we were a group of 10 people. We saw everything in the Old City and visited Taxsim. We got to know so much about the history and places in Istanbul. Ozden\u2019s suggestions about restaurants was perfect and we never had a bad meal. He was also so helpful about everything and making arrangements for our stay and tours. Don\u2019t miss the Bosporus Tour, with a great lunch. Also, definitely shop with Ozden, expecially the Turkish specialties like rugs, Turkish lights, and sweets. He arranged our airport transport which was great and so helpful as well as suggesting accommodations. We will definitely use Turkland Tours on our next trip to Istanbul."

When I was there I had the pleasure of booking a tourof Ephesus with Ozden and Ibrahim from Turkland Tours. I can not say enough about the terrific service that these people provided. I was picked up at my hotel in Istanbul, driven to the airport, met at the airport in Izmir, driven to Ephesus where my guide was waiting for me. The guide was witty, knowledgeable and as eager to share his passion for the ruins as I was to hear about them. After the tour there was a wonderful lunch, a visit to a couple of merchants where there was no pressure to buy anything. I was then driven back to the Izmir airport, picked up in Istanbul and driven back to my hotel. These guys called me to make sure everything was good and were willing to do anything to make the trip better. Let me also mention, that I was supposed to make this trip in 2013 but I got sick and could nottravel. Turkland totally understood and worked with me and credited me 100% of the costs. They could not be more understanding.When I came back to Istanbul I was so impressed with the trip to Izmir that I had Turkland arrange a tour for me in Istanbul. Again, they took care of everything and provided me with a knowledgeable, low key guide that fit my personality perfectly. Turkland Travel is a great company and I would recommend them highly."

I have had 2 days to spare and asked Hasan Birdal of Turkland Tours to get me a personal guide because I cannot walk fast but desperately wanted to see as much as I could. A charming young lady, Melek escorted me looking after me with as much care as if I were her grandmother . She told me the history of the Hippodrome, guided me through the beautiful Blue Mosque and Hagia Sophia. All the time giving me details of the past. As an antophogist I was interested in her life. We had lunch with Hasan and took the afternoon Bosphorus boat tour pase so many beautiful homes and palaces. The second day we explored Tophapi Palace and the Archaeology Museum. I could gave spent days there. I was impressed how the people of Turkey respect their history and past. I must say a special thanks to the taxi driver who took me to the airport. He left his van, took me in, found someone who showed where the handicapped section was and deposited me and my suitcase apologizing for not staying longer. First class. I hope to come back again. I would add I am 82 and traveling on my own."

We were then delivered back to Istanbul to the front door of our Hotel.I highly recommend Turkland Tours for any tour in Turkey. We found the guides to be very professional, spoke great English, easy to get along with and made our tour very easy and comfortable and also at a reasonable cost.Thank you so much.

They took care of everything and checked with our drivers if we didn't show up on time at our next destination. We used Turkland after my parents first met them 7 years ago and my brother and sister-in-law used them a few years later. Both strongly recommended them.

Both our parents and our brother's family have travelled with Turkland at different times and it became quickly obvious why they both recommended Ozden and his group. We travelled by bus and plane throughout the country, from Istanbul to Capadoccia, Pamukkale and Fethiye, taking in a mix of adventures with both private and larger tour groups (our choice). We were taken care of literally every step of the way, no issues with bus transfers or anything else. Hotels that Turkland selected were very nice and all provided great food options. From a Canadian traveller, I recommend Turkland Tours, Ozden and Ibrahim for anyone travelling to this great country. Best, Christina & Devin"

The guide that they assigned us, Mr Hassan U. was good and pleasant. He was very knowlegable about the history of Turkey and the sites that we visited. Also, we were impressed with his management of time. When he saw the line for Aya Sophia was very long in the morning, he made the decision to switch to other less crowded site and came back to Aya Sophia after lunch so, we didn't have to wait in line (to enter) for a long time. Also, having private tour meant, we controlled the time we wanted to spend at each place and had all the tickets prepared so that we didn't have to queu to get tickets. The only minor glitch, we experienced was about the drop off at the airport. The driver dropped us off at the wrong airline area, even though we told him about our flight before, and I was sure that the office had also told him. We had to walk all the way to the end of the terminal to find the correct check in counter. (A rather long walk especially, with heavy luggages). I guess, I had expected to be flawless service especially the rate that this company has charged us. As I said above, this was minor and could easily rectified for convinience of future clients. Overall, my husband and I were satisfied with our experience with this company and highly recommend it. "

We spent 3 days with a Turkland guide each day. Our three guided days were special and worked for our family because the guides structured the pace and each day based on our family. The kids asked so many questions and the guides were knowledgeable and kept them interested. We set up the guides via email before we arrived. Ozden and the other folks at Turkland Tours were really helpful. The guides were great with our kids and really set up or days to work for our family. We never would have had the same experience in Turkey if we did not use Turkland. The Turkland guides are professional and prompt. They really go the extra mile for clients. For example - we left a cell phone in the van one day and were really nervous when we discovered it missing that evening. With one call to Turkland, they located the phone and had it delivered to our hotel the next morning. I would recommend Turkland Tours to anyone who is going to spend time in Istanbul."

When I started to feel better Ozden even offered to come pick me up so I could join them. You'll notice that most of these reviews state that Turkland's guests leave feeling like family and that could not be more true. We had two different guides over our 3 days and both were wonderful, and we had the pleasure of spending time with Ozden as well. I know we saw more of the non-touristy side of Istanbul than we ever would have had we booked elsewhere and I could not have asked for a better experience than we have. We even recommended Turkland to others as we traveled Europe, knowing we were giving them the advantage of having the best guides (and friends) that there are.

Before we even arrived Ozden's patience and humour were evident as the three of us travellers went back and forth with Ozden over email to finalise dates and our seemingly ever-changing plans :-).My sister had never been to Turkey and Ozden advised that Cappadocia is a must-do and see. Ozden arranged everything-- our flights from Istanbul and back, tours, a most amazing cave hotel (MDC) and a sunrise hot air balloon experience. We expected to be just 3 of many on a Cappadocia tour but oh, were we wrong! Ozden arranged a private (PRIVATE!) tour with a wonderful tour guide named Mustafa. We spent two days with knowledgeable, sincere, and lovely Mustafa, and two nights basking in the moonlight at the hotel. But its what's not advertised that makes Turkland and Ozden stand out in a saturated market.My sister had fallen ill on the plane on the way to Istanbul from the States. When we arrived, Ozden was immediately prepared to take her to the doctor, and inquired repeatedly about her well-being. We had Ozden's cell phone numbers in case she worsened and were instructed to call day or night. It was my sister's first trip overseas and she felt so safe and well-cared for, as we all did.We were in Istanbul not just to see the most amazing sights, but to do family research as our father was born there. Ozden and his team made calls for us and helped us every step of the way. Ozden even got us an appointment with the Director of Research at the Ottoman Bank Archives! He then accompanied us!!! Ozden's associate Berkay called a cemetery and my Baba's (father's) high school, and offered to accompany us to a church in a neighbourhood by the airport (Yesilkoy). Even now that we are back home Ozden and the good folks of Turkland Tours continue to help, offering to pick up and translate documents, and checking in on my sister.Ozden is a gem and incredibly funny! If I could give 10 stars to Turkland Tours I would. Turkland is our go-to agency and Ozden is our go-to guide."

Even with all places that \u00d6zden and his other lovely guide, Emrecan, showed us, we only scratched the surface.

We even had a private tour to Kapadokya and booked us in wonderful cave hotel nestled in the landscape (MVC hotel). Our guide in Kapadokya, Mustafa, was full of information and obviously loved his job. Then in Kusadasi, I got upgraded to a 5 star hotel!! That was a last minute surprise and who doesn't love surprises like that? The tours to Ephesus and Pamukkale/Hieropolis were also small group tours with great guides (Maria was wonderful). Ozden, with his personal touch, made this trip one to never forget!"

Professional, courteous and efficient. They arranged 2 very different tours for me and both tours were immensely satisfying.The private guide Serhat I had on both days was a complete professional. He knew his stuff and I was particularly impressed with his technology skills. At various times, the trusty Samsung phone was produced and I could see clearly maps, paintings or objects that Serhat was explaining to me. This did not detract from the experience but only enhanced it. I was also taken with the laser pointer which again was another gem.Turkland Travel also arranged the transfers from my hotel to start the tours. The drivers turned up on time, the vehicle was spotless and the driving skills were impeccable. Your journey begins when you are picked up and when you are returned back to your hotel. And then the tour would begin. You are in a bubble from the time you leave until the time you return. That is the way travel should be \u2013 smooth as silk."

He can provide individual, small group, and large group tours depending on your budget, timetable, and how you like to tour. He also arranged flights to Izmir and Kayseri, all airport transportation, and the most fantastic guides in Ephesus and Cappedocia (reviewed separately). Everything was done perfectly, and we had a thoroughly wonderful time.

A small group of us had 2 days touring Istanbul. All pre-arranged and hassle free for us. The first day was with a delightful woman named Ezra who took us to the Spice Bizarre, and an adjacent mosque (very special), up the Bosphorus to Sariyer for a delicious fish lunch, then to the Asian side for a panoramic view of both sides of the city. We ended our day at the Topkapi Palace. Ezra was sweet and attentive to all of our questions. Day 2 was with Ozden, the \"mayor of Istanbul\". First stop the Blue Mosque. He sat us down, prepped us for our experience, and on we went. Next stop the Cistern and then lunch at the Pudding Shop (bustling and yummy). We had a special need or two and Ozden was quick to make a call to satisfy. This day also included the Hagia Sophia and the new Rug Museum - amazing for rug lovers. Not only was the tour day a delight, the after party at a local restaurant along with rug shopping with the expert topped off the day with delights that followed me home. And, he saved the day when he discovered my friend's flight the next day was out of the Asian airport, not the European airport\u2026she would have missed her flight had he not stepped in. Ozden and his team do what they love and we reeked the benefits. Lucky for me I have new friends in Istanbul. Looking forward to new discoveries with Ozden next time I'm in there."

In Istanbul, it\u2019s possible to spend a large part of the day just waiting for entry to some of the more popular attractions. Thankfully, we swept straight to the front of the line with Ozden, who had also organised pre-paid tickets. So no lines for us! Having opted for a private tour, we were able to chop and change the schedule to suit ourselves. This was a handy way to get around the days some attractions were closed. We were also able to make some changes on the fly. That worked especially well for us.Our guide was witty, fun and tremendously knowledgeable. It was a genuine pleasure spending time together. The two days we spent in Istanbul felt more like being shown around by a friend than anything else. Plus, almost everywhere, he pointed out the chance for a unique photo opportunity. Had we tried sightseeing alone, we\u2019d have missed most of those. Thanks to his wealth of knowledge, Ozden ably summarised the story of each new stop, so it wasn\u2019t necessary to wait for a break in the crowd to read all the curatorial notes ourselves. That\u2019s not to say there wasn\u2019t a chance to soak up the atmosphere and immerse ourselves in each new attraction. We had plenty of time to linger and explore whatever we discovered along the way."

We booked a semi-private tour with Ozden for the full-day city tour of IstanbulPositives - Our guide Esra was very informative and friendly. The 3-star review does not reflect her service, but rather the value and structure of the overall experience!! The owner, Ozden, was also very responsive and organized over email, and the hotel pickup was prompt.Negatives - Compared to the other tours we took during our European vacation, we felt that this was grossly overpriced and did not provide much additional value over a standard group tour. The \"full day\" tour started around 10am and wrapped up by 2:30, including a self-paid lunch. While we were able to skip the lines at each tourist attraction (big plus!), we didn't feel the itinerary included anything special, but instead only the standard attractions that we could have found on our own. Dissapointing, especially given the amount of money we spent.Additionally, the final component of our tour was a bizarre sales pitch in a Turkish carpet showroom. Although the vendors were friendly and did teach us some things about Turkish carpet making, we were then subjected to a sales pitch, something I did not expect on a private tour after having spent several hundred Euros.In summary - Friendly guide, professional company, but you can get better value for your money elsewhere"

My husband is generally skeptical about tours of any sort because he likes to discover things on his own. However with the guidance of Ozden of Turkland Tours, it was clear to us that this would be the company to go with. For the good reasons he pointed out, we opted for a full day semi-private tour of the Old City and Relics. On the morning when we were picked up at our hotel, we were very surprised to find out we were the only couple on this particular walking tour this day! While this was what we personally think of as good fortune, we also believe this is a clear indication of the professional, customer-service focus of this company. Whether or not the tour was full, it went forward as promised. Absolutely no inconvenience or disappointment to the travelers. Wonderful!  Our tour guide was Darya. We have to say that she is excellent. She knows her history, she is very personable and helpful and her English is very good. We felt comfortable with her immediately. Darya had a natural sense about when we were unsure of what to do or how to negotiate for example, and she helped us through this at the various sites such as the Grand Bazaar.  If you are worried about walking, the tour of the Old City and Relics is very manageable - the pace is moderate and the distances are not great between sites. There is time to stop and sit to enjoy the ambiance of, say, the gardens and courtyards of the palace, etcetera. Plenty of time for photos, too.  We highly recommend Turkland Tours. The company is very reliable and conscientious about their business. Ozden's follow up for customer satisfaction and our subsequent conversation proved this. In all of our years of travel, we have not had 1 tour operator ever give us follow-up care! We also thanked our lucky stars that we booked this tour ahead of time. Our tour guide was organized and had all the admission tickets ready for us as needed. We were grateful we did not have to stand in some of those very, very long line ups at the popular tourist sites."

Ibrahim planned 3 perfect days for our group of 3 people in Istanbul. It was a bit challenging as we had to work around the Kurban Bayram\u0131 holiday. The day before we started with our guide Fatih Ozturk, Ibrahim came to our hotel and went over all the details. He answered all of our questions and also gave us excellent restaurant recommendations. During our time with Fatih, Ibrahim checked in and made sure things were going as scheduled. Turkland Tours did in incredible job planning our trip. Every detail was taken care of. After our 3rd day of touring, they took us to our ship. Our guide Fatih was wonderful. So attentive and knowledgeable. We had a lot of fun with him."

They made such a difference to our travel experience. We can't praise them highly enough. Full of information, both serious and quirky, and delivered in such a fun and enjoyable way. They seem to have the knack of pitching their info at the right level for the people they are talking to.

One of the highlights was a personalised tour of Istanbul with Ozden of Turkland Tours.Ozden made history come alive as he took us to all the great monuments of the city as well as provide a general history of Turkey. He was very attentive to our needs, as well as give us ample time to enjoy the sites (unlike bus tours that invariably give you only 5 minutes at each spot) and was clearly one of the best tour guides we have ever experienced. We were a small party of six who also wanted to experience trying the local cuisine which he was more than happy to show us some of the off the tourist spots to try some of the local foods. We would highly recommend Ozden to anyone wanting a highly informative and relaxing tour of a beautiful city and would certainly use him again when we next visit Turkey."

The tours he booked for me were amazing and informative and amusing and the hotels i was booked in were friendly and clean. While I was in Istanbul I also stayed at his hostel, The Orient and the staff are amazing, the view from the rooftop terrace is breathtaking and it's the cleanest hostel I've EVER stayed in!

In Istanbul we were met by \u00d6zden, who showed us the Chora church and the Hagia Sophia, in Ankara the guide F\u00fcsun took us to the Citadel, the Muzeum of Anatolian Culture and the mausoleum of Atat\u00fcrk.

This was the first time Turkland Travels organized a trip to Bogazkale, a small village a couple of hours east of Ankara, were the impressive ruins of the Hittite capital Hattusas are situated, so \u00d6zden kept an eye on us, calling us to check that everything was OK. So this seems to be Turkland Travels in a nutshell: High competance and friendly care.

Totally worth the cost. I would recommend doing Pammukkale in a day trip and not overnight. Totally worth seeing, but not much else to do their. We loved Oludeniz and if we did it again would have stayed their longer. Istanbul is a super cool city and in 3 days we just barely scratched the surface.

We got to see so much in 2 weeks, wasted very little time on things not worth doing and had the most genuine and knowledgable guides throughout. From Cappadocia to Antalya, Pammakule and Istanbul, we were blown away and also got plenty of time to relax. Multiple times we were on tours in places with multiple tours going on and every time, I felt like we had the best guide and would have dredded being on some of the mass guide trips. We even had a private guide in Instanbul, who in the afternoon, ask us what we want to do, took us off the beaten path, took us for fish sandwiches and humored me, while I asked a lot of politics questions, while sipping Turkish Tea along the Bosphorus for an hour. If I could give 6 stars I would.My advice to you, is have Turkland plan your whole trip or at least run your itinerary by them. They probably have better deals, places and connections in every place and it isn't more expensive."

Her knowledge, advice, wonderful professional manner were so welcome, however her friendship she showed us was what I wanted to thank her for.

The timings were perfect, the transportation amazing (always just a moment away even when it was busy at certain places) the lunch stops we had just yummy and we were able to set our own pace at times which you cannot do on these huge tours with many people. Priority entry to most places meant you do not have to stand in the long lines of tourists too....a bonus when is is very hot in the sun! Senem went well over what she had to by offering her phone number to us in case of emergency during our 3 weeks in Turkey and on our return for our final few days back in Istanbul met up with us for drinks and dinner.

I traveled solo to Istanbul in April 2013.\u00a0 By email, I\u2019d easily made arrangements with Ozden for two days of private tours with his good friend, Emrecan.\u00a0 She met me at my hotel the first day at the arranged time and we went first to the Hippodrome, then to the Blue Mosque and Hagia Sophia.\u00a0 Emrecan is exceptionally knowledgeable about Istanbul and I enjoyed talking with her. My private tour was well worth the money. \u00a0I found out next that Ozden and Emrecan are much more than tour guides.\u00a0 I twisted my foot and could barely walk.\u00a0 Emrecan took me to a pharmacy for an ace bandage and then back to my hotel.\u00a0 She and Ozden both telephoned me that afternoon to see how I was doing.\u00a0 The next day, Ozden drove me to the hospital emergency room, staying with me and interpreting while my foot was x-rayed and the doctor told me it was broken. He then drove me to a pharmacy to have my prescription filled and buy a cane.\u00a0 His great sense of humor helped cheer me up and both Ozden and Emrecan stayed in touch over the next couple days.\u00a0 Emrecan also made the arrangements for me to get wheelchair assistance at Ataturk Airport when I left.\u00a0 Without them, alone in Istanbul with a broken foot would have been very lonely and difficult.\u00a0 With them, I had two friends in Istanbul who cared for me.\u00a0 I hope to soon go back to Istanbul to see them and finish my tour. I highly recommend Turkland Travel."

When I initially contacted Ibrahim from Turkland Tours to investigate our using their services, his prompt responses gave me confidence that we were in good hands. However, when you're spending a lot of money and you're on a once in a lifetime trip you still have high expectations. On the day of our tour, our guide, Murat Aksu, was waiting for us in our hotel lobby 15 minutes earlier than scheduled Murat's expertise on all the sights we visited was outstanding, but what really enhanced the experience was his willingness to talk to us about day to day life in Istanbul. His English was flawless and we really felt we were spending the day with a friend. That same evening, Ibrahim called us from the hospital (where his dad had just had surgery) to make sure that we had enjoyed our day. What more can you say!!!!"

Ozden Basak and Turkland Travel were recommended to us by our hotel, The Empress Zoe. Ozden and I exchanged a few easy emails before the trip to arrange dates and itinerary. We opted for 2 days of private tours with Ozden in Istanbul and he arranged further private tours for us at Ephesus and environs, plus transfer to Bodrum. We would never have seen or learned so much if we did not have Ozden guiding our way. We appreciated how Ozden provided an introduction to each site and then let us explore at our own pace. With Ozden's know-how we were able to avoid long lines and crunch times at the sites, and he even managed to put together a schedule that was mindful of our jet lag. Lunches were delicious! Ozden literally knows all the angles, as he made sure to get just the right photo shots of the family. Since it was a private tour, Ozden was able to adjust to our requests as they came up. We added an unplanned stop at the S\u00fcleymaniye Mosque, and at a handicraft center. Ozden also responded to a last minute request for a day gulet cruise out of Bodrum, which was arranged perfectly and even with a surprise birthday cake for my husband. After we left Istanbul Ozden called to check that everything was going well at Ephesus, and then again while we were on the gulet. It feels like Ozden is now part of the family, and certainly a cherished part of our memories from Turkey. Te\u015fekk\u00fcrler."

Using Google and Trip advisory I came up with the contact of Mr. Cenan of Medhills Travel. All feedback about Cenan were great hence I took a chance to work with Cenan to provide me with an itinerary with all key spots with our dates. The hotel selections were great. Six persons consisted of two coming from London, one from India, two from NY State and one from California. Hence there was a logistic of various pick up time of the arrivals and departure. We all were very impressed with the professional planning of the trip and flawless execution. We were in Turkey from May 14 th thru May 24, 2013. We toured Cappdocia, Izmir, Ephesus and Pamukkale.We started our tour to early and got to see the Blue Mosque in the morning followed by lunch. Lunch place was reasonably good for we vegetarians. After lunch we saw Hagia Sophie. My favorite sight in Hagia Sophia but this was tied for second place the Blue Mosque. Both of these attractions are very well covered by other tourists and I agree with what I have read about it in Trip Advisory site.We had planned two free days in Istanbul for our own planning. We used one day to take a day trip on the Bosphorous cruise. This was well worth it in terms of the cost of 25TL and gorgeous views of various historical buildings on both sides of the river. After the trip we walked thru Spice Market on our way to the hotel. We enjoyed the spice market but I was surprised at the prices of pistachio and the variations of the prices from 35 TL to 95 TL per kilo. I am not sure as to why such difference and whether it was tourist trap. Even saffron was very expensive compared to saffron from Spain available in USA.We used one day to visit Asian side of Istanbul. That was an experience too. One can see the difference in the environment.Money exchange: The currency exchanges near Grand Bazaar were offering the best rates and were not charging commission."

One of the best parts of the trip was visiting our friend, Ozden Basak of Turkland Travel. He spent over a month helping me plan the most efficient method of seeing some of the greatest sights in Turkey.Ozden arranged for a visit to a leather factory and showroom, Best Leather, which was a very successful shopping trip. Our tour guide, Emrecan Kurt, was a darling and took us to the Spice Market, a ferry on the Bosphorus, for lunch at a fishing village, the Chora Museum, and the Basilica Cistern. She was quite knowledge with excellent English. We enjoyed her very much.Ozden walked us to the Grand Bazaar and handed us off to Murat for a shopping tour with only 'friends' of Ozden and Murat. To go in alone is far too overwhelming with over 3,000 shops! Murat's assistance was most appreciated.We left Istanbul to visit Cappadocia, which was absolutely spectacular! Then we stayed in Kusadasi for four nights to enjoy day trips, with the most notable being Pamukkale. I'll review the other sights and hotels separately, but mention all of these arrangements because of the work that Ozden did to make our trip SO perfect.We returned to Istanbul for one more night in the beautiful Sultanahmet Sarayi Hotel (Palace), which I have already reviewed on Tripadvisor. Our last night was with Ozden and Onur on the roof top of the Orient Hostel and I'll write a separate review for it.All of our in-country transportation and transfers were arranged by Turkland Travel and our trip was absolutely perfect! Thank you, Ozden, you were a wonderful host as always!"

He picked us up, took us to the Grand Bazaar, the catacombs, Hagia Sofia, Blue Mosque, and Topkapi Palace with stops for coffee and lunch. He knew which sites to visit when, so we did not have to wait in endless lines. He told us how to avoid unwanted salesmen. At the end of the tour, he brought us to his rug and ceramic shop which I had not anticipated. One couple of our group had planned on buying a rug, and was pleased with the selection and price (after obligatory negotiation and 60% drop in price). The rest of us did not and were able to just say no."

I was impressed with his enthusiasm, friendliness--and his historical knowledge goes without saying. Because of him, my husband and I decided to take our Christmas vacation there with our two college-aged sons. Ozden laid out a plan for us and we literally hit the ground running! For ten glorious days, we visited the historical sites, went to some of the most fabulous restaurants we've ever been to, and were shown how to navigate around the city on our own, when we felt like it. Our visit to Istanbul was so positive, it encouraged one of our sons to study Turkish. Ozden and his team made us feel like we were VIPs as well as part of the community. Amazing! We are all planning another trip there during the summer because our trip was so fun and interesting--all thanks to Ozden and his team. Their professionalism is to be noted--as well as their genuine interest in making our trip to their magnificent city a memorable one. My husband and I have since been back to Istanbul three different times since our vacation for business and have looked up Turkland to revisit some of the restaurants they'd recommended during our vacation.

Someone was waiting for us at the airport and called us as we arrived at our hostel. Turkland's team also manages a few different properties throughout the city, so you can enjoy different neighborhoods through them. We enjoyed that, and found lodging with them in Sultanahmet, Taksim Sq and Cihangir during our time in Istanbul. In addition, we coordinated tours and transport when we took a trip to Cappadocia.

All transportation arrangements were always handled expeditiously. The value for this tour was excellent. I can't commend Esra and Turkland high enough."

In my case, they didn't ask for any online payment, just saying I should bring the cash with me. On tour morning, my bus driver arrived about 3 minutes before the 8 o'clock agreed-to time, and off we went to a staging area where people in different tours got into their specific buses. The guide was easy to understand, very kind and knowledgeable about the great history of Turkey from the early Greeks and Romans to the Ottoman and Byzantine periods up through the 20th century. He kept us moving to stay on time as we went to various mosques, museums, palaces and the lunch date (which, by the way was in the Olive restaurant's rooftop room and was a nice lunch). After we finished up, several of us decide to go visit the Basilica Cistern as recommended by our guide."

The Turkland Travel Agency give us a tour on the first day, take us to the hotel, pick us up the next day for another private tour. Our guide Ozden was extremely well informed and had a good feel for our interests and the pace at which we wanted to see things. He chose wonderful local restaurants for lunch . He was a very interesting person and a pleasant companion for the two days in Istanbul. We learned a lot about Turkish history and culture from him. At the end of the tour, which made us feel very special , Ibrahim met us to ensure everything went as planned. He took a very personal interest in our having a great tour. I would highly recommend Turkland Travel Agency anyone who want to come Istanul / Turkey"

My husband and I were lucky enough to spend 5 days of our honeymoon in Turkey and booked a few tours with Ibrahim at Turkland to help us make the most of our time. I made the booking inquiry rather close to our travel dates, and Ibrahim was very prompt and helpful with getting us booked quickly. He was able to accommodate flexible tours (e.g. private vs. group, other cities--Ephesus). And he took time to come out and say hello to us during our first tour.We took four different tours (three tours and one dinner activity) with four different guides and they were all good experiences. Beyond the sheer beauty of the sites, I found the guides to be personable and passionate about what they do. They were professional, knowledgeable, and often willing to show us something a little extra if we asked. They even did their best to keep my husband--who is not particularly interested in history--entertained (especially our Ephesus guide). Everyone, from Ibrahim to the drivers, were very pleasant to deal with.One note about Turkland (and I'm not sure if this applies generally to other tour companies as well): Three out of the four tours that we booked with them were actually run out of other companies/establishments. I didn't have any issue with this, but had anything come up it might have been confusing trying to figure out which company and person we would have needed to deal with. The fourth tour was with what I believe was an independent guide who works with Turkland, but not exclusively.Overall I was satisfied with Turkland and would consider using them again, as well as recommending them to other Turkey-bound travelers."

Throughout the two-weeks, all drivers, tour guides, flights and accomodations were superior. Literally, there were no hassles and given that we were traveling with a young child, this was amazing! The gentleness with which they treated my granddaughter was touching. I will use them again when I travel alone or with a group of friends. And I highly recommend them for family travel. The guides were first-class and were truly knowledgeable without being boring. We were sad to see the day end but happy to know that the next day would bring about more fun. There are many touring agencies in Turkey. Last year I booked a week-long trip with one only to have the tour cancelled two-days before we were to depart. It was so disappointing! Not with the Turkland Travel Agency. Everything went as planned and the end result was that my family could enjoy the beauty of Turkey without the hassles. It was a rewarding experience!"

Arriving in Istanbul unexpectedly 2 hours early resulted in our guide not being their to greet us, however such is the grace and politeness of the Turkish (we would not have had this treatment at home!) and a phone call, we were whisked away to our hotel by a most accommodating fellow with much apology along the way.Later in the day we met up with Turkland Tours - Ozden; he was our guide for the next four days of our Istanbul Tour. Charming, charismatic, extremely knowledgeable and FUN are words best descriptive of this man. Our daily experiences of Istanbul in his company are etched firmly in our memory. We experienced the Spice Market, cruising the Bosphorus, Beyler Beyer Palace Istanbul Old City including the Blue Mosque - Hippodrome - Haghia Sophia - Topkapi Palace - Grand Bazaar and much much more. He took us to places 'off the tourist' map ( he read us immediately identifying that we would be up for the experience!) - eating in local restaurants (Sembal Meat House) to allow us to better experience first hand the wonders of this gorgeous city.We left Istanbul after a week with Marmaris as our destination. If you ever get the opportunity to drive the west coast heading south to Marmaris - jump at it. We had a personal guide, Mehmet K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fckbayram, another great person full on knowledge, and entertainment.

My husband and I went to Turkey a couple of years ago and Ozden is like family now. Our circumstances were a bit unusual: beyond just a vacation, our trip was also to begin the search for my father's family. My father was born in Istanbul but hadn't been back. We'd been trying to get him to go; until he was ready we decided to go first. Well Ozden took us to the neighborhood in which my Baba grew up, we found his street, took photos of his school, immersed ourselves in his old life. Ozden also set us up to go to Cappadocia, Epheses, and Fethiye on the coast. We took a gulet (sailboat) and traveled around the Med. Everything Ozden suggested and arranged was beyond amazing. We even dined with his family on a restaurant rooftop overlooking Sultanamet! Sadly my father passed before he could come back with us, but Ozden is still a cherished part of our lives. He is even helping me find my Baba's family, something I've prayed for for years. And my husband's upcoming business trip to Istanbul with his colleagues will be facilitated by Turkland. Yay! Ozden and Turkland embody all that is this country and this city of cities: warmth, hospitality, authenticity, essential beauty, and wit. We love Turkland and we love Ozden."

It first started with e-mail communications with Ilker to inquire about the Ephesus tour in Kusadasi. He was always poilte, courteous and communicated effectively and quickly. I also liked the fact that he was willing to work with our group to make slight modifications to the itinerary so that we can see all that my group of 14 people want to see. We were on a cruise and Istanbul was our first stop. We all took a boat tour in this city and weren't too impressed. We figured that Kusadasi would be nice, but overall, we'd feel the same way we did in Istanbul. Thank goodness we were wrong. I think a big part of the reason why our tour was So much more enjoyable was because of Ozden (tour guide extraordinaire!). We had a long list of places to visit and he somehow timed our visits so that it was never crowded or felt rushed. Can you imagine...we were one of the first groups in St. John's basilica with tour buses approaching as we left, no line whatsoever at the virgin mary house, i'd say only a handful of people were at the ephesus ruins. It was so nice to have pictures without throngs of tourists in the way or blocking the view. One of the highlights I have to say on this tour is our private lunch in Ozden's friend's estate where they make and sell carpets. OMG, the food was amazing and the service was superb! We all could not stop eating and teh food and drinks just kept on coming! The dishes were so good, I cry about the fact that I forgot to ask for the recipes. I drool in my dreams about that food. The carpet demo and sale was not pushy at all and if I had some money to spend, I would have bought one. Some people in my group did buy a carpet and they actually received it already, so they were actually faster than their estimated delivery time. I also wanted to note that we had a private shuttle that was clean and very comfortable for my group of 14. After our tour with Ozden, all I could think about was how we are hoping to go back to Turkey and take more tours with him. Thanks for an amazing tour!"

Originally, we had planned on spending two days at the beach, but we had such a good time with Melis that I called Ozden and requested her services for tours of Priene, Miletus and Didyma.

We saw, ate, and shopped much more efficiently with him than we would have on our own or on a group tour. When we returned 7 years later to stay several days, Ozden recommended the best Bosporus cruise and the best Turkish bath in town. Both trips we appreciated his excellent English, love and knowledge of Istanbul, and accessibility. If you want to buy ceramics or rugs, Ozden can advise on reasonable prices, saving you serious $-- he kept me from paying 3x too much for a large ceramic bowl! He is a great travel advisor for a new or returning visitor to Istanbul!"

When we decided to return to Istanbul this year, we immediately contacted Turkland Tours and Ozden. This time, Ozden arranged our lodging and gave us extremely helpful advice for seeing more of the city. He set up a tour of the Bosphorous for us, and also arranged our first visit to a hamam. We would easily put any trip in Ozden's hands; he knows what he is doing, he is prompt and responsive, and he is very thoughtful about your needs. He has a first class operation, and it is wonderful to have a trusted advisor in an unfamiliar city."

It's a huge city after all. Ozden arranged everything to perfection! Personal driver waiting at the airport, wonderful boutique hotel in Sultanahmad with roof top bar and view of dolphins in the Sea of Marmara, two days of privately guided city tours - with Ozden and his A license we passed the longest lines of tourists waiting at Topkapi and Blue Mosque. As my husband noticed: \"Living like a Hollywood star!\". We felt like A-list! Ozden shared his personal restaurant tips and we fell in love with Sembal Meat House, across from his office. We ended the fun days of sight seeing with apple tea at his office. We spent our last day browsing around on our own, shopping at the spice market, taking lots of photos. By then we felt like locals. We hope to come back to see more of Turkey. We whole heartedly recommend Turkland Tours to make your stay a total success."

I checked their web sight descriptions of the tours and the afternoon Ottoman relics tour included the Topkapi Palace and the Grand Bazaar as highlights. I wanted to visit the Grand Bazaar on Saturday because I read that many of the shops are closed on Sunday. Our tour guide informed us that the afternoon tour will not visit the Grand Bazaar. I was very disappointed. After our visit to the Topkapi Palace our tour guide graciously had the bus driver drop us off near the Grand Bazaar but after our visit we had to make our way back to our hotel on our own. That was an adventure and very tiring. The Bezantine Relics tour the next morning did include the Grand Bazaar even though most of the shops were closed. Having already been to the Bazaar we skipped that part of the tour and again made our way back to the hotel on our own."

But more importantly, what you get with Turkland Travel is a much deeper and more meaningful experience than you will get from other tour organizers. I have traveled extensively with Ozden within Turkey and with others around the world and the Turkland experience is truley unique.What make Ozden so special, is the real personal investment that he makes in you. It was clear from the begining that this was not about money. Tourism in Turkey is not his his job, it is his passion and you feel it when you are with him. Also, while you do see the important historical sites and receive all the knowledge about them that you could every want, he takes the time to take you into the heart of Istanbul and the country as a whole. You go to the places he goes to...you eat drink and play in places that the locals love. You experience Turkey in a way that goes way beyond a guided tour. I can also say that after spending time with Turkland, you will have friends for life. You will become part of the family....and this is what makes them stand head and shoulders above the rest. Of course, it does not hurt that their prices are also great. (-;"

Later that evening, Ozden dropped us off in Taksim to wonder through the pedestrian walkway.To top things off, the following morning, he had one of his associates meet us at our hotel and walk us to the Aya Sofia to purchase our tickets for us (accredited tour guides don't wait in line).

This was the best experience we've had in any country. Ozden is a very knowledgable guide and answered myriad questions we showered him with. Very importantly, he is very passionate about Turkish history, culture and art. He is also an extremely skillful guide. We had a very full program one day. My mom has been a professional guide in St. Petersburg, Russia her entire life. I appreciate what it takes for a guide to present \"material\" in meaningful way without overwhelming, and finish on time. I don't know how Ozden did it, but we never feeled rushed, although our program was extremely full and busy with visits to mosques, neighborhoods, fortresses, bazaars, museums, etc. and we still managed to have a nice relaxing lunch in a fishing village, smoked hookah and did a bit of shopping. Wow! Our very last day Ozden took us for a tour of the Museum of Islamic Art. It changed my entire perspective on Muslim art. I must say, before that I did not know much about it and preferred western art to anything else. The tour, conducted by Ozden himself, helped me discover and appreciate the Islamic art and see it in social context. Did you know, you can \"read\" a woman's life story by looking at the rug she made? Not only rugs are stunning pieces of art, they are also communication devices.Ozden made out trip and we are thinking of going back. He will be the first to know!"

It gave us a great 'taste' for such a beautiful city. Ozden showed us the traditional sites, but also took us to some out of the way places and shared personal stories about life in the city where East Meets West. His attention to detail and customization of our short touring time (2 half days) maximized our experience. Ozden's 'boutique' approach to touring made us feel like a long lost friend had come home to family with his warmth and graciousness.Ozden was patient with us as we took many pictures, preferred to not walk too much, and like shopping over museums. He made it all happen on very short notice. One of these days we will return and see more of Istanbul and Turkey!"

We met Ozden just as we arrived in Istanbul. He served us hot apple tea, made our dinner reservation and familiarized us with the neighborhood. The next day, we were able to see so many sights with Ozden in a shorter amount of time than it would have taken on our own. His love of history and his knowledge of his country's culture and traditions provided so much insight. Ozden genuinely cared that we had a wonderful, safe trip and helped us for the duration of our stay whether we had hired him for that day or not. Most importantly, we had a friend in Turkey and a friend for life."

Each and every tour is packed full of information, fun and adventure. There is no one that I have met that has more knowledge nor anyone who enjoys the sites more. Even though you know that Ozden has visited thse sites perhaps hundreds of times - nothing is stale! I visited the Blue Mosque, Topaki Palace, Haggia Sophia, and went on a lovely Bospherous Cruise. All were included in the price of the tour. There are tremendous photo opportunities (don't try to take a photo of the gold in the palace - read the signs :)You will need a good pair of running shoes and light jacket if you go when it is not summer. Each place was fully described entertainingly and with wit and wisdom. If you go - say a big hello to all from me!"

But the attacks happened at the airport and our cruise line rerouted our trip. Azru, the owner, was great about the cancellation. As it turned out she offered some tours and transportation in Athens so as an exchange, she arranged a driver to pick us up at the cruise ship and gave us a lovely tour of Athens before taking us to the airport. That worked very well and didn't have to spend unnecessary hours in the Athens airport. Because of all these changes and the sommer events in Istanbul we exchanged many emails including photos of each other' families. My sincere hope is that we can again travel to Istanbul so I can meet my new friend. This was the terrific result of NOT traveling to Istanbul which is a bucket list for me. We have even discussed some politics!Bev Trojan"

Going to Istanbul in 2016 turned out to be the best decision I made. Because of a low number of tourists you get to experience the real Istanbul without hordes of people wondering about. You will be able to access all of the attractions without standing in lines for hours and have more freedom as you won't have to plan anything in advance."

Despite the terrorist attacks the first part of the year my husband, myself and two small children booked two nights in Istanbul for mid-June. Istanbul had long been on my husband's bucket list, and we decided the risk was minimal. Well the first week of June another bombing took place and fear almost won out. After multiple conversations with Arzu, and absolutely no pressure...only sympathy, we decided on a private tour. On June 16th at 10:00 a.m. our full-day adventure began...be sure to pack your walking shoes and take a water bottle. Ebru took us on a wonderful tour of the old city (Constantinople). The kids ran around the Hippodrome, my husband and I marveled at the Aya Sofia and the Blue Mosque, and the kids clung to us as we lurked through the Basilica Cistern. The entire time we felt comfortable and were continually amazed at Ebru's expansive knowledge, patience and winning spirit with the kids. We look forward to hopefully returning to Istanbul and seeing more of its wonders with Walks in Istanbul. Arzu and Ebru were a pleasant reminder that we often let our fears of evil override the vast kindness of people and, at the very least, the statistical unlikelihood of being a victim of terrorism."

It was important to us to support local businesses owned by women, so she made sure to take us to excellent places where we were confident about spending our money.

She is wonderfully knowledgeable, very articulate and incredibly attentive to everyone's needs. Everyone was greatly impressed by her and learned more than we would have in a week on our own. Since I have been home, I have referred two other groups of friends to her and they both felt the same way. She has great pride in her beautiful culture and an exceptional knowledge of its history."

First off, she showed us how to get a transit pass, and how to navigate the trolley line-indispensable! Next, she took us into the old town and navigated us through all the major sites. As the tour description promised, we didn't go in, just got our bearings. We were able to return to the sites later in the day after deciding where to spend our time. We were walking down a street and all of a sudden she led us into a quiet courtyard for tea and then helped us mark up our map with ideas for the rest of our visit. A walk through the spice market capped off the tour. We left her at lunch time, and she dropped us off at a very nice restaurant with a great view of the Bosphorus. I was a bit afraid it was going to be \"food with a view,\" but it was quite tasty and not very expensive. We spent the afternoon visiting the sites she showed us, really taking our time. We watched a whirling dervish show she recommended and then grabbed a light dinner at Namli, a kind of mezze deli she also recommended. What a fantastic way to start our trip!"

Arzu's fantastic English, talent for navigating tourist areas, and generally superior approach to her craft - combined with a winning personality that makes her a delight to hang out with in general - makes her the best we've ever seen.When we return to this beautiful city, our first email will be to book more time with Arzu, and we would recommend the same to anyone else planning a visit.(refers to a trip that actually occurred in December of 2014 - sorry for such a belated review!)"

Arzu responded very quickly and set us up for a tour with Adnan Duvenci - he was great! He met us at our hotel and started the day by helping us work out a small issue we were having there. From there we went to the Blue Mosque, the Cistern, the Grand Bazaar and to lunch. It was the perfect amount of time for us, and Adnan was an excellent guide. Our lunch was delicious - he ordered a variety of local dishes that we had not tried yet. Adnan took great care of us - even calling the next morning with a lunch and itinerary suggestion (which we happily followed). Can't recommend him enough."

This was our first time in Istanbul and during our trip we took private or small group tours with 4 tour companies and also did some sightseeing on our own and Walks in Istanbul provided, by far, the best experience introducing us to this magical city from a local's perspective. Our guide (Arzu) was not only knowledgeable and delightful but her love for her country truly brought the city to life. We travel a lot and have taken many tours but this one really stood out: maybe it was our guide's over 20 years of experience as a tour guide, her professionalism or her passion for sharing all of Istanbul's secrets but whatever the reason the day was just magical.Our guide shared with us a wealth of knowledge that was not just relevant but interesting. My friend was very interested in the current situation of the country and she was very gracious answering many questions and sharing with us not only Istanbul's glorious past but also it's complicated present bringing the complexities of this marvelous city into perspective and we felt that we got a deeper and more meaningful understanding of Istanbul.Walks in Istanbul tailored the tour to our specific interests and as we learned more about the city and became interested in specific aspects of it's history our guide added sites to our tour that we had not even considered (or knew existed) and even thought the direction of the tour kept changing she always has a wealth of information and anecdotes to share about each site.From the moment we contacted Walks In Istanbul by email they were extremely helpful answering questions, giving recommendations and sending us a list of useful information about the city which was very helpful, specially for someone visiting for the first time. Like I mentioned before we had tours scheduled with different companies and from the moment we booked Walks In Istanbul stood out by their level of professionalism and their sincere interest in ensuring we had a wonderful time in Istanbul.Our experience was so fantastic that my only regret is that we did not book more days with Walk In Istanbul. We did however take their private guided tour on our trip to Ephesus and Tan, our guide there, was also marvelous. Thank you Walks in Istanbul for an unforgettable experience!"

We visited Istanbul around December 21-25, 2015.After watching some Rick Steves videos on Turkey, I decided that getting a licensed, professional local tour guide was the way to go. It's an affordable option and highly interactive way of seeing the major sites. We went with Arzu on a private tour. She led our family of four (my kids 16 and 11) on a 3 hour guided tour of the Blue Mosque, Hippodome, local streets, and Grand Bazaar. The time went so quickly that I wished we had spent the entire day with her.The difference between reading about the history of these sites or listening to it on rented audio devices is the ability to ask questions and get further comment. You can't that with books or MP3s. Nothing can substitute local knowledge and the interaction you get with someone who grew up in Istanbul. I appreciated not only her knowledge but love and pride for this city. Too much bad stuff is happening and being reported in the news. I really needed to meet someone from Istanbul and someone who geniunely loves their city and country. For me, visiting a country a big part of my experience is talking to and making new friends in a new country. We may be different in culture and speak different languages but we all share the same hopes and dreams in life. Meeting Arzu and having her share about the history of a few important places is something I will always cherish.I highly recommend taking a local tour and I recommend Arzu without reservation because her English is perfect and her ability to communicate with fact and passion come out in her tour."

In mid-October, 2015, my husband and I spent three days touring Istanbul with \u201cWalks In Istanbul.\u201d Our pre-trip arrangements were professionally made online with Arzu who promptly answered all of our questions and concerns. Since we had been to Istanbul before and done the \u201cA\u201d list we wanted to see another side of Istanbul. We did, and it was great. For 3 days and one amazing evening, our guide was Etem. Touring Istanbul with Etem provided us with more insight and appreciation than we had from any other guide during our recent one-month trip. We wish we could have had the entire month with him. He is so thorough with profound detail in his commentary, but there is a coherence and eloquence to his delivery that creates a sense of wonder, awe, and appreciation. Because of Etem, we knew how to look at the artistry and meaning of tiles and carpets; we understood what to see and what to look for in a mosque. His pacing is brilliant; it allowed us to absorb details to create firm memories and understanding rather than just see, listen, and rush to the next destination with only a vague recollection of where we had been.  He introduced us to the foods of Turkey and the Monday, \u201cDeep into Islam at Night\u201d venture will be an experience we will never forget. Any and every question we asked received a thoughtful, complete answer that painted a canvas broader and deeper than a mere factual sentence or two. His own appreciation and knowledge of his country and culture was contagious. What's not to love about time with Etem? He's a treasure, truly. After he subtly helped a young American couple who had received terrible advice from a local while riding the tram and whose conversation we overheard, the young woman asked me if he were my son. I only wish! Needless to say, we were more than pleased with everything \u201cWalks in Istanbul\u201d provided us on this trip. When we visit Istanbul again, our first contact will be Arzu."

Arzu was very prompt and helpful in designing itineraries for our tour days. As we neared our departure date, there were some issues that arose for Arzu and she asked Ebru to act as our guide. How lucky were we! Ebru is extremely knowledgeable about history, architecture, religion, current events (and, I am certain, many other subjects). She provided us with such a grand introduction to the incredible city of Istanbul. She speaks English beautifully. She is energetic and engaging, knows many, many people in the city, and has an incredible knowledge of the streets of Istanbul. Our itineraries were rather full, but Ebru found ways to adust things to provide us a first rate time. She introduced us to our neighborhood the first day (this was an impromtu addition to our schedule) and she added to, and subtracted from, the initial schedules in small but useful ways. She took us to excellent restaurants for our lunches and pointed out various other good places to eat. Ebru's love of her city is evident at all times. She has a great talent for reducing complex matters to understandable, intellectually digestible portions. Then, if you want more detail, she is ready to provide those details. Obviously, she knows much more than we could absorb, but her guidance made our trip to Istanbul so much more than it would have otherwise been. In addition to providing a truly first rate touring experience, Ebru was also a very delightful conversationalist with opinions and insights. While private tours are not cheap, the cost for the tours was very reasonable given how much we learned. If you can, hire Ebru or Arzu to guide you through Istanbul. It is more than worth it."

            "review": "World-class Tour Guide.. Arzu of Walking Tours in Istanbul offers incredible value for money: our time in the city simply would not have been the same had we not done this. Read on.We asked for a tailor-made tour: a quest for lost Constantinople. Not a tour of the Top 10 most famous sites in Istanbul but a walk off the beaten track. It turned out to be far more substantial than we could have imagined and I would encourage anyone to ask her to repeat it: Arzu knew exactly where to find the ancient city today; the areas and places where the descendants of the Greeks live and worship now, and the remains, that you overlook but were once crucial.Starting with a cab ride from Fatih along the Bosphorus to our starting point by the Byzantine city walls, Arzu, a native Istanbulite, told us of the change the city and she has seen in modern times and what it was like just 20, 30, 40 years ago.Going further back in time, on our walk along the walls she brought to life the siege of Constantinople and heroic tales of the assault and defence in this struggle to the death for supremacy of one of the most beautiful capitals of the world.Our visit to the Chora church was equally vibrant and enlightening as she interpreted the story told by the mosaics and the true significance and meanings of Orthodox Christianity at that time, drawing parallels to religion and concepts of faith over the centuries.For all I know, Arzu is probably secular and an atheist but, as she pointed out, she can believe in people believing, and how that makes the miraculous come true (for them). She literally opened doors, including into a closed-off Greek church to see what is said to be the Pillar of Flagellation; brought to Istanbul by Empress Helena, I think, this is the stone where Christ was whipped. The sanctity was palable and the place certainly revered by the old janitor.Passing the last remaining Greek school and the residence of the Patriarch of Istanbul, Arzu told us of the political and cultural exception this community benefitted from under the sultans and, indeed, to this day. She also explained the challenges it faces as the numbers of men called to priesthood grow rarer and of the difficult and complex search for a new patriarch.Walking the Fenel and Balat neighbourhoods, she pointed out how each is distinct and how the heritage can change dramatically from street to street. With Arzu we saw the development some of the most conservative areas undergo; young hipsters would suddenly replace traditionally dressed elder gentlemen and working women. (In one street we came across several good-looking coffee bars and one micro-roastery, The Coffee Department, which I can strongly recommend).We had seen Hagia Sophia, the Basilica Cisterns and all the major sites on our own, but with Arzu we saw the Istanbul I liked the most. One we would never have known otherwise.At the end of the day we went back to Fatih to squeeze in a last minute visit to the Grand Bazaar: again Arzu\u2019s suggestions (a fine craft department store (with an excellent and great value for money roof top restaurant) and an outstanding antique dealer) by the entrance to the Grand Bazaar were really so much better than the well-known destination.Arzu didn\u2019t just give us plenty of value for money: she\u2019s a great lady, very, very smart and knowledgeable, and really, really nice.I can\u2019t imagine returning to Istanbul without going with Walking Tours again, and I will tell anyone I know going to get in touch and book Arzu."

We visited Greek churches that pre date the Ottoman Empire and were certainly not on the tourist trail.We had lunch a local cafe and learnt so much about the local culture and life challenges.Arzu took us to the Asia side and we were blown away by the vast difference in living. Although I can't recall the name of the boulevard suffice to say that it was nothing like anything you see on the European side and certainly not on the tourist list.

She was absolutely amazing! She is an authority on the history of the area and was never at a loss for an explanation for any question we had.She was punctual, friendly, and scholarly. She was literally an encyclopedia of information. I believe that if I had attempted to see the historical sites of the Blue Mosque, Ayasofia, and Topkapi Palace on my own I would have wasted my time. There is just no way I could have learned that much on my own. Because of her narrative I was able to see these 3 places in one day instead of two and not only saw them but experienced them. I paid for a private tour so it was a little pricey for just two people but I would have to say worth every penny...there is just no better way to see these sites than with a guide of this calibre. Thank you Ebru for an unforgettable day."

As an Istanbul resident, I'd seen much of what we saw before -- however, doing the walk with Arzu made me to see it in a new light. She was informative, patient (we were with a five-year-old), accommodating and, most importantly, knowledgeable and great company. We went to Cora Church and she told us the fascinating stories of the mosaics - both, their construction and the stories held within. We visited the city walls, and churches / mosques we had no idea existed. Truly, outstanding. Your day and your visit of Istanbul will be enriched with a day walking with Arzu."

As a result, we have come away with an incredible amount of knowledge on this fantastic city.Etem is a walking encyclopaedia! His stories on historical figures brought familiar names and places to life. We quizzed him about everything from Turkish politics to food to architecture to history and he gave easy to understand, objective explanations that gave us the ability to put Turkisk history and life into perspective.Our culinary tour introduced us to amazing spices and how to properly use them; the best places to get street food like pide amd stuffed mussels that were mouthwateringly delicious; the Turkish restaurants that cook \"home style\"; and where to get the best sweets such as Turkish baklava and Turkish delight. A morning of pure gourmand heaven!The Topkapi Palace covers 3.5 square kilometres. Etem took us into amazingly interesting parts that I am sure we would have missed and gave such insightful explanations as to the \"Infrastructure\" of a Sultan's life and lifestyle. We felt we had a far better understanding of how Turkish history evolved.We will return to Istanbul at some point in time and when we do, Walks in Istanbul will be top of the list. Thank you Arzu for your extremely helpful suggestions and Etem, thank you for 2 incredible days."

She showed us around the 4 main sites - the Hippodrome, the Blue Mosque, the Cisterns the Topkai Palace and the Hagia Sophia, and then gave us really useful suggestions on where to go next. Even better - she took us to a fabulous restaurant for lunch, away from most of the tourists with fabulous food and very reasonable prices. It was at the top floor of a very classy Department store and Art Gallery, and we would never have found it on our own. Ebru's knowledge and her enthusiasm to share it made our visit to Istanbul a great success"

In my opinion, there is no better way to see a city than with someone who is local to the area.

She was extremely helpful in answering all our questions prior to the trip and she arranged an excellent guide for us in the person of Etem. He was extremely knowledgeable and conveyed this knowledge in an easy and clear manner such that those of us not as au fait with Istanbul history as we perhaps should have been were suitably enlightened. He also took us to two excellent eateries, one on the European side and one on the Asian, where we sampled local cuisine we would have almost certainly not ordered had we been left to our own devices - and we would have missed out on delicious food!All in all I can only recommend Istanbul. A real mix of cultures and history seeping out of the walls. To get the full value from a short visit (not to mention the ability to skip long queues) a guide is a very valuable asset. Arzu and her team are the perfect choice in this regard - you need look no further!"

She was knowlegeable but knew how to choose interesting details rather than overwhelming us with them. She arranged for us to enjoy an evening culinary tour with her colleague, Adnan, who was equally well-versed.

You can stand and look at all the buildings but if you don't hear about their histories you a missing a huge part of the enjoyment of being there. Having a great guide is a a great help. We witnessed some not so good guides leading other groups giving very basic explanations. In Etim we had a guide who knew everything about everything. We were a group who would ask alot of searching questions but he knew the answer to everything. It was something he just learned off. He knew the information and was able to put it in great context. His English was perfect. Would pass as an American no problem. I thought I knew a fair bit about Istanbuls history but I came away learning loads more. We had two lovely lunchs. The whole day was paced really well. Really I couldn't even suggest an improvement. It was from 09:30 to 16:30 and picked up from the hotel. Thats about a perfect amount of time. You get great exercise without wearing yourself out. I'll have very fond memories of Istanbul. It's an exotic city. Real east meets west. Alot less hassle than I thought it might be. People are friendly. Prices are great. Food is very good. It's a buzzing metropolis a mixture of the ancient and modern. It felt safe. The Aya Sophia is amazing, the great Mosques are splendid and the Topaki palace is a beautiful spot."

Details: My wife and I were ending our cruise in Istanbul and wanted to spend a few days exploring the city. I started out looking through Trip Advisor and after reading many reviews, I decided that I liked what others had said about Walks in Istanbul. I sent an email and within a few hours I had received a response from Arzu. Arzu asked about what we would like to see and do, and with that, made recommendations. We decided on two days, and since our hotel was not within walking distance of the sites, she recommended that we also get a private vehicle. Arzu used PayPal for payments which made the transactions quick, easy, and painless. When we were on our cruise we discovered our friends had not made any plans for their time in Istanbul so I fired off a quick email to Arzu to ask if I could add two more to the tour, and of course I heard back right away that it would be no problem.Adnan was our guide for the two days. He picked us up at our hotel and as we drove to meet our friends, I could tell right away that Adnan was a perfect guide for us. He has a wonderful personality that fit wonderfully with our group. Adnan not only took us to the major sites (Hagia Sophia, Blue Mosque, Basilica Cistern, Topkapi Palace, Spice Market and the Grand Bazaar), but to the quieter Asian side where we meandered through the streets, explored a few shops, and even had morning tea like locals. We thoroughly enjoyed his knowledge of Turkey, the city and its people, along with his in-depth understanding of its history and his ability to communicate that in a style that we all enjoyed. In addition to the tour, Adnan made reservations for us at Turkish bath (hamam) at the conclusion of our second day. He also recommended and made reservations at a great rooftop restaurant where we had the most excellent fresh sea bass. This was perhaps our best meal of our trip, with the excellent back drop of the Bosphorus on one side and the Hagia Sophia and Blue Mosque on the other; all at sunset! Perfect.I highly recommend Walks in Istanbul and our guide Adnan Duvenci! It was an experience we will not soon forget! Thank you for sharing your city with us."

Her english is impeccable, her passion for Turkey, Istanbul and its history shines through, and she gives it the very personal touch of a local resident who truly loves the place. I would highly recommend her tours!"

In spite of the pouring rain, Arzu's energy didn't flag and through the window of Istanbulu foods, we learned about the multi-cultures of this great city. We were introduced to the Spice Bazaar, her favorite seller there, the only one run by a woman, and were welcomed by the lovely family that ran it. Tea and tastes. The nearby Rustem Pasa \u00e7amii, the Sulymanye were also visited and enjoyed. A highlight was the Ali Baba restaurant, where we ate lunch inside at the 'kitchen' - delicious white beans, moussaka, dolmas, pickled cabbage, and the incomparable pumpkin dessert. So much did we love this that we returned during a sunny day to eat outside and re-visit the mosque. Brava to Arzu and Walks in Istanbul. Arzu is attractive, lively, knowledgeable, and open."

I had fallen in love with your city the instant I stepped out in it; spending two days with your guidance deepened my understanding of it's fascinating history and culture. I have never been one for guided tours, opting to wander the streets of the World and just absorb. I didn't feel comfortable to do that in Istanbul so I sought you out. My apprehension was misguided; I've never felt safer as a woman alone in a city as in Istanbul. Nevertheless, that apprehension lead me to an experience I will never forget and for which I will be forever grateful to you both. Thank you for sharing the wonders of your city with me. There were so many wonderful experiences ... too many to list ... but one stands out being sitting on the carpet in the Rustem Pasha Mosque listening to Ebru talk about one of her favourites. I will be back!!! Hopefully in a month or so. Whilst I'll enjoy spending a day back at Aya Sofya, Topkapi, and Suleymaniye quietly on my own, I'll be booking a couple more days with you; there is so much more to see and do. I will be recommending you two friends who will visit Istanbul this year."

As travel agents, we are used to planning, organizing, and booking everything ahead of time, however, because of the nature of our trip (14 months long), it is not always possible to plan ahead. This was the case in Turkey, as we had just not had time to pre-plan anything!Since we are also writing a blog, a travel agent colleague (also a trusted professional and friend) contacted us when she realized we'd be in Istanbul. She connected us to Arzu and Walks in Istanbul, highly recommending their company for efficient, interesting, and trustworthy tours. We immediately wrote Arzu an email and within a few hours, she had responded. By the end of the day, we had plans to connect the next morning and were really looking forward to meeting Arzu.Of course, you never know what to expect, but because we trust our travel agent colleague and friend, we had high hopes. Arzu did not disappoint. She met us at the entrance to the Hagia Sofia and our lovely day began. Arzu was relaxed, informative, and friendly, offering us great insights into the culture, history, and religion of the area. She answered questions and made sure to know what we were most interested in. While we were able to enjoy some of the typical highlights of Istanbul, Arzu also took us to a less touristy area as well (as requested), and we were able to meander through the streets, explore the shops, and even dine like locals. We had a truly wonderful time and were so glad we had gotten to connect. I would highly recommend Walks in Istanbul and will be sure to connect my clients with them as well! Thanks, Arzu and Walks in Istanbul, for a lovely day."

We did the Deep Into Islam at Night tour, which was truly a highlight of our vacation. We also did another full day tour in the more modern part of the city that my two teenage boys just loved. Esin was very flexible and worked with us to make sure we covered everything on our walks. Next time we are in Istanbul (hopefully not too long), I will plan to do even more of the walking tours.

She made all the arrangements extremely easy, picked me out of the crowd at our meeting spot, and instantly won me over. She is easy going, speaks superb English, and really knows how to pack the most into a day. I shared the tour with a nice German couple, and we focused on the big attractions (Hagia Sophia, Blue Mosque, Topkapi). Arzu had a remarkably deep and broad knowledge of the historical, architectural and cultural significance of the sites, but I especially liked the way that she wove site-specific narratives into a broader understanding of Turkish culture and identify. She had a very sophisticated understanding of the interactions between religion, ethnicity, history and politics was quick to pick up on our particular interests, enriching the narrative accordingly. She has passionate interests of her own, a great sense of humor and an upbeat style, but she leaves you plenty of room and time to admire and wonder in silence as well. I learned so much from her! I recommend her with the highest enthusiasm. You won't be disappointed!"

Thanks to Arzu, my experience in Istanbul couldn't have been further from that expectation.

She certainly made good on her promise to show us Istanbul as through the eyes of those that call it home. Perhaps most memorable for me was her quote; \"The history of Istanbul is like a cake, with layers upon layers of civilisation.\" When you're guided by Arzu, you can be sure to see more of those layers than you thought possible.

As a native of the city, Arzu also knows the places off the beaten track like the back of her hand; we saw so many things and experienced so many foods that we would have missed out on without her personal touch.

Arzu was our guide for the Bazar (4 people) and we were not disappointed. It may be a matter of the Bazar's overwhelming nature---it is huge and complex. Additionally, Arzu cannot shop or barter for others. Obviously, she has to wait while shoppers make their comparisons and decisions. She can point out particular shops (and did a great job of that) but her recommendation is always, \"decide what you want and what you are willing to pay then go ahead and buy\"---that is great advice but could be given in writing. There are better uses for Arzu's many talents. Thus, my suggestion is to tackle the Bazar as an experience on your own and use Arzu's incredible expertise where it is most useful in the explanation of history, architecture, food, culture, etc.Our visit to Istanbul was memorable and enlightening in great part because of Aruz."

My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our Istanbul tours with you in 2010 and that is why I recommended you to my daughter and her family for this recent trip.When I asked my youngest granddaughter (age 9) what she liked best about Istanbul she shouted \"Arzu!\" Our entire family agreed. In fact, I think you may have spoiled everyone because now all they want are \"private tours just like Arzu did.\" Istanbul is such an amazing city and we were able to realize it's wonder because of your excellent skills. You are an outstanding tour guide and one of the most delightful people I have met in all my travels. Thank you for all the special memories of your beautiful city!"

After some initial correspondence with Arzu before we left Australia we settled on a half day tour as we had visited the key attractions from a previous cruise stop over. Ebru from \"Walks in Istanbul Tours\" met us on time in our hotel lobby and we sat down and agreed the itinerary based on our expectations and Ebru's strategy to meet those expectations. In short Ebru took us on a half day walk through the old and new cities from a locals perspective. Other than a short stop for some local Baklava and coffee Ebru pointed out historic sites, buildings, favoured shops and restaurants, including rides on the tram and cable car as required. It was like being with a personal friend sharing interests and experiencing the history of Istanbul. At no time were we left on our own for shopping that would come later in our own time as this tour set us up for the rest of our stay. We suggest a full day tour for new visitors to Istanbul as half a day would be required visiting the key tourist attractions, Grand Bazaar, Topkapi Palace, Blue Mosque etc. We spent a wonderful week in Istanbul, including the Anzac/ Troy tour and rated Ebru's walking tour our top highlight.Phil & Susan - Australia"

            "review": "A great disappointment and such a pity. Yes, something did go terribly wrong with this much anticipated tour.I went by the reviews here when deciding to use this company, and I must say I was very impressed by what everyone had written and also with my correspondence with Arzu. The price seemed fair for a four hour tour, and people agreed to it. I was so sure it would meet my expectations.What went terribly wrong, was that all it turned out to be, for most of the group, was a babysitting tram ride to the market, with brief commentary, and then a pointing out of the different stores. This took all of about an hour and a half. Arzu then said we could shop on our own and come back and drop things off at a coffee shop when we were done, and she would be there. Where she went very wrong, was that she asked for payment at that point, and said that if people wanted to come back at 5pm, she would get them back to the ship. At that point, most people were really fed up at having to pay US$42 per person for what was basically an hour and a half of the tour guide's time. At no point did she make it clear that everyone had to return for a continuation of the tour en route back to the ship. Had she done that, people would have been content to pay what they did. Meantime, we tired of the shopping at 4pm and returned to the coffee shop, and there was no one waiting there, as was promised. I have no idea what happened, or where Arzu was, but another guide, Ebru, arrived at 4.55pm, and found four of us sitting there. She took the four of us on a wonderful walking tour through the spice market and back to ship, all the while filling us in with the history of the buildings and other anecdotal information. It was wonderful and very worthwhile, but we felt very bad for our group who had had enough of the tour, and went their own way/made their own way back to the ship. To be honest, only four of us got our money's worth, and of course the following day, the news of the rip - off tour had spread around the ship like wild fire.The miscommunication came from the guide. The tour participants cannot be blamed here. They were asked for their money, and given an option to return to get back to the ship. Had the guide been clear that the tour would continue for the allotted time of four hours, I have no doubt that everyone would have come back to the meeting point to get what they had booked for.Arzu is an intelligent woman and an experienced tour guide, and her English is flawless, so there really is no excuse for this kind of miscommunication. A four hour tour, must be just that - four full hours. Pointing out the different shops, even if she does not get commission, does not cut it as a walking tour of the Bazaar. There must be so many fascinating stories and secret places and history of the building, that could and should have been shared with the group. Her colleague, Ebru managed to enthral us on the walking return to the ship, so this could have been done on the way to the Bazaar as well.I think what tour guides need to ask themselves, is,\" would this tour have satisfied me?\". If they honestly cannot answer in the affirmative - and I am sure Arzu would not have been happy with this tour and price had she had it in another country - then something is very wrong.It is a great pity that a company's otherwise stellar reputation has been tarnished by this one tour, and one can only hope that this really bad experience will not be repeated with other tourists. I would have loved to have given Arzu an excellent rating, but in all honesty, that simply is not possible."

On reading the previous reviews of this company, I feel we must have met Arzul on a very bad day for her as our experiences were nothing like this.We joined a walking tour of Istanbul arranged through a fellow passenger on our cruise ship. It was supposed to be for four hours from 2 to 6 pm. There were fourteen of us altogether. It was going to cost $42 or E30 per person.However, the tour proved to be the biggest let down of our cruise. In fact it was the worst value for money tour we have had in twelve cruises.Arzul met us a bit later than the allotted meeting time as she had gone to another area and then we all set off to get the tram to the Grand Bazaar. A short walk to the tram and then another short walk from the tram stop to the Bazaar. She gave us some brief information along the way.We were then taken a walk round the Bazaar for about half an hour by the tour guide with a few comments about the shops etc. and she suddenly announced she would leave us there for an hour and a half and pick us up at 5 pm to take us back on the tram to the ship. She then asked for payment!Well I think we were all so shocked we did actually pay her, something that I later really regretted. At the very most we should have just paid 50%.It was not a walking tour at all and we could have easily made our way to the bazaar on the tram or by taxi for a very minimal cost. I know the organizer has written directly to Arzul with her views but I would strongly recommend not using this company as it was a total rip off.I am pleased to say we had an excellent tour guide the following day from a different company and we were all so delighted after our disappointment of our first experience in Istanbul!"

After reading the glowing reviews on this site, I got in touch with Arzu to book two days of guiding for a group (we were six people between the ages of mid-20s to mid-60s). She wasn't able to take us but she offered her colleague Asli. I was hesitant at first since all the reviews I read praised Arzu but I took a chance and I am so glad I did!Asli was fantastic. We spent two days in her company seeing all the usual tourist sites (Topkapi, Aya Sofya, Blue Mosque, Suleyman's Mosque - don't miss this one, by the way! - The Cistern, Spice Market, Grand Bazaar etc. etc.). She also took us across the water to the market in Kadikoy (not very touristy area of town where the locals live and shop) and I loved it so much that I went back at the end of my trip and spent an evening wandering around among the locals.Asli knows what she is talking about. She was able to answer any question we had and patiently gave us a run down of Turkish history (in fact she had to repeat this history lesson again and again because some of us had a hard time getting all the complex comings and goings straight - Turkish history is not straight forward!). She shielded us from the tourist hordes by taking us down quiet back streets, getting us into fast track lines, using her guiding pass to skip ticket buying lines (this is really such a valuable part of having a guide....we visited in late April and already the lines were insane and in some cases, people were standing in the wrong lines). With Asli to guide us, we made the most of our two short days and saw a lot. She also knew some very good spots to eat.The price per day was $350 USD (we were also given the option of paying in euro or lira). This was the price for the whole group, not per person. Our days were meant to be 9:30 to 4:30 but on the first day, we went way overtime and Asli did not seem to notice or mind. And on the second day, we started half an hour early. So I really appreciated the flexibility.350 USD is not a small amount of money but I would argue that it was worth every penny. Here's why:1. Our group ranged in age and we all equally enjoyed Asli's guiding and what we saw and did. 2. The tour was entirely bespoke. We customized it before and during, on the fly. 3. On our own, we would never have been able to pack so many sights into two days. The lines alone would have made it impossible (and remember this was in April, not high, high season). There's a good chance, given our group, that we would have gotten lost, become annoyed with each other etc. etc. Instead, with Asli to lead us, we were able to relax, look around, soak up the city and enjoy ourselves.4. After two days with Asli, my husband and I were prepared to tackle the city on our own and we spent four days wandering around on our own at the end of the trip. We'd already done all the things that benefit most from a guide and we had a good mental map of the city.5. Sometimes you get what you pay for and as I said, Asli was incredibly knowledgeable and was also willing and happy to answer our questions about more local matters (the political situation in Turkey, for example, something that is interesting at the moment, to say the least). She was candid in a way that guidebooks never ever are. There are many, many completely useless guides around and I think this was money well spent.A note about Arzu: I communicated with us before the trip and she was also prompt and helpful in her relies, giving me recommendations for things outside of Isanbul as well."

I have been in Istanbul about 30 years ago with my wife so I decided to come back with my son Lorenzo in order to let him visit Istanbul and Cappaocia. We arrived in the city and we looked for a travel agency. We found Erkan and Dilek, two worderful people! We have organized together our tour along Turkey! I spent great time with my family thanks to them. In Istanbul we have seen Basilica Cistern, Aya Sofya, Topkapi Palace, Ayasofya H\u00fcrrem Sultan Hamam, Blue Mosque, Istanbul Archaeology Museums, Turkish and Islamic Arts Museum, Galata Tower, Spice Bazaar and Grand Bazaar. After a week we flew to Cappadocia landing in Kayseri and sleeping in G\u00f6reme. There we visited G\u00f6reme Open-Air Museum, Underground Cities of Derinkuyu and Kaymakli, Avanos, \u00dcrg\u00fcp, Hisars: Ortahisar and U\u00e7hisar, Zelve Open-Air Museum. We also did one of the most amazing thing, hot air balloons.I will never forget all those places."

I would highly recommend this company's services, and encourage you to request Murat if possible!"

They organized us the entire tour with flights, transfers, rent car and one of the most beautiful things I have done in my life, hot air balloon. They have been very patient, willing and very professional with us. We have spent a beautiful time there thanks to them. I had never seen Turkey before and now I consider this country one of the most amazing! I experienced wonderful things.

From the moment we got to the airport, we had nice shuttle vans dropping us to and from, and this continued in Cappadocia and Izmir. We got to visit and see many many sights: Topkapi palace, Hagia Sofia, Blue mosque, Sultan Ahmed mosque, ancient city of Ephesus, Temple of Artemis, the Ihlara valley, Derinkuyu underground city, and other places as well. I love history and I must say that the tour guides were amazing. I learned a lot from the sightseeing and I got to see a lot. In addition, the arrangements were perfect. I would definitely go back tot he Travel store and let Erkan arrange everything again for myself, family or friends. He is HIGHLY recommended for anyone who would like to visit Istanbul and have trips planned to other cities. Thank you for an amazing trip."

Transportation between locations as well as airport transfers were all perfect, we never waited for a driver and vans were clean, comfortable and had great drivers. We travelled from Istanbul to Goreme where we spent three days enjoying the lovely town, hot air balloons in the morning and experiencing the Red & Green tours. The guides were all engaging, informative and contributed to our overall experience. Hot air ballooning is a must!! We then travelled overland to Pamukkale where we toured the ruins on our own time and discovered the great little town. Last stop was Kusadasi, we had another excellent tour guide for a day trip to Ephesus and some free time in this wonderful seaside town, a nice bit of relaxation before returning to Istanbul. Erkan really listened to the needs of our family, arranging all aspects of our trip including air travel, ground transportation, hotels, tours and evening incorporating some downtime to relax and take it all in. Thanks Erkan, we were blown away, fell in love with Turkey and cannot wait to return!!"

I had been into a couple of other travel agents but none had gained my trust. I had immediate rapport with Erkan and could not have asked for a better tour guide. Erkan took the time to tailor make a 17 day tour of Turkey factoring in the style of accommodation and transport best suited to me. The accommodation was outstanding and in prime locations. I have returned home to Australia and have recommended Erkan to my friends by way of paying forward his excellent service. If you are a free style traveller but seek the support and service of an agent within Turkey or once you arrive, I have no hesitation in recommending the Travel Store as the way to go - I have such great memories and hope to return one day and will be sure to visit Erkan and the Travel Store to say hello."

The absolute climax was the hot air ballooning in cappodoccia. The Antalyan beaches are absolutely beautiful, whether it is for a long stroll or just to sit down and relax.I would definitely recommend this operator!

I was efficiently picked up and dropped off from my arrival to end of my holiday. I picked the wrong package as I would've skipped Cannakale entirely and preferred more leisure time in Istanbul. Also the hotel in Pamukkale was not great but I think it was the best one available in that area. Quite a boring place. There was an evening variety show but still boring. All food was amazing. I ate way too much All tour guides were fantastic. One bathroom stop on the way to Pamukkale was totally gross. Made great friends on the tours. Would like to visit again and will definitely contact Travelshop first."

They have a team of experienced people who had coordinated all the bookings of Hotels, Sightseeing, Pick Up and Drop from the Airport. The tour went as planned starting with Istanbul. We were accompanied by our Tour Guide Mr Turgay Polat (incidentally his name also sounds like tour guide which was confusing at first as we kept asking him for his name).On the first day we visited the Hippodrome, The Blue Mosque, Topkapi Palace, The Hagia Sophia and The Grand Bazaar.These sites have amazing history and was diligently explained by Turgay without whom it would not have held so much interest to us being from another country.In the evening we went to a Dinner Cruise on the Bosphorus Strait. This Cruise includes Dinner, drinks and also Cultural Performances by their Troupe.On the second day we went to the Spice Bazaar to buy the local Turkish Delight, The Turkish Coffee and some Teas and Spices. I think the Grand Bazaar was better experience from photography point of view and Spice Bazaar from purchase point.We had lunch at an Authentic Turkish Restaurant and also visited a Hammam that was 350 years old.Evening was spent in the Takshim Square which is both lively and full of night life.The Third day we went to Anatalya by domestic flight and stayed at the Spice Hotel and Spa, a beautiful property.On the fourth day we went for the Day tour to the Duden Waterfall and to visit the Old Town of Anatalya with a beautiful little Harbour.I think I have so much to write. In the end i would like to Turgay and Travel Shop Turkey for the excellent time we had in Turkey.RegardsSumit Aggarwal"

It was a lovely day of November 2015, As we stepped out of Ataturk Airport Istanbul, at first sight a Turkish tour guide from Travel Shop Turkey was waiting for us to pick up, but we were totally surprised when we met Mr. Eren Varaich such a great gentleman speaking Punjabi, Hindi, English fluently. It was so much warm welcomed by the tour coordinator Mr. Eren to Istanbul and we suddenly thought that now we need not to worry about anything because we had no communication or language problem. Honestly speaking he was totally friendly with us and so we were with him. He told us about Istanbul, Turkish history, culture, cuisine n wonderful sightseeings. Istanbul is a multicultural city mixed people from around the world. We enjoyed Turkish food n beverages, day to day tours & night life was so wonderful. We visited most beautiful places in Istanbul especially Cappadocia tour and balloon ride was amazing. It was a pre planned tour package by Travel Shop Turkey. From the Airport pick up to the hotel, from the hotel to all the touring destinations, everything was well planned as we expected. Everything was perfect on timing. I am really thankful that we had set up a tour with Travel Shop Turkey. I am highly recommending to all my family, friends, and colleagues to contact them and spend quality of time in Istanbul. Truly It made our visit a very much memorable. Huge thanks to our tour coordinator Mr. Eren Varaich and Travel Shop Turkey.Dalip Bajwa."

We spent 4 days in Istanbul which was arranged by the professional staff of Travel Shop Turkey. We took the 4 DAYS OLD CITY & BOSPHORUS TOUR PACKAGE. We stayed in a cozy and relaxing hotel named Darkmen Hotel located in Laleli, Fatih. The location of the hotel is just so perfect especially for shopping lovers like me and my sibling. We spent a lot of time roving around the area. We enjoyed the place even after a long day of tour. The location is very close to Metro, 5 mins you will reach the Yenikapi terminal station. Also,10 minutes of walking you will reach grand bazaar where you can find almost everything you need for souvenirs and gifts. The hotel roomwhich was given to us is not as big as the other hotels with the same category but not bad if you will only stay for 3nights. They offer free use of sauna, swimming pool and turkish bath. The hotel is very quiet and clean and they've got friendly staff as well. The tour went as well as we were expecting. The tour guide is knowledgeable and friendly. He knows how to treat his guests very well. He gives not just handful of information about certain destinations\u2019 history but he also gives advice on how to deal with local people especially to the vendors inside the grand bazaar.Istanbul is such a beautiful place, a good place to relax and unwind. It offers very rich culture and history. You will be amazed by its beauty. How I wish we spent more time in this lovely city.All of the good things happened in Istanbul would not be possible without the help of our tour operator, TRAVELSHOP TURKEY! From the Airport pick up to the hotel, from the hotel to the destinations( Topkapi Palace, Hagia Sofia, Hippodrome, Blue mosque, grand bazaar and bosphorus cruise) everything is well planned. You would not worry about your lunch as they have the best choice for kebab and other Turkish dishes. They own a very comfortable airconditioned van, they have english speaking staff. They dont forget to remind their guests about the time of pick up, the driver arrives on time or even earlier. Very professional. Two thumbs UP to all their staff!We are very much thankful for them for arranging everything for us. They made us feel we were tourists who can stay in Istanbul with ease and happiness. They didn\u2019t allow us to feel like we were strangers in a busy city of Istanbul. We went back to Bahrain with happiness and joy. We brought not just wonderful shots in our cameras but also smiles in our face, we\u2019ve got memories that will definitely last a lifetime.I will definitely come back to this place, not only in Istanbul but hopefully I can go to other parts of Turkey as well, and by the time I decided when to come back, Travelshop Turkey is the only company I will keep in mind. I know they are just a phone call away and they are more than happy to assist me!Again, thank you for making this trip a very memorable one! Til our next trip to Turkey!Te\u015fekk\u00fcr ederim!!"

Our agent did a ton of research for us to get us answers to questions, investigate places that we put forth as worthy of considering for accommodations or site seeing, and was always responsive (like, within a few minutes usually). We felt like all of our needs were addressed, we had constant support from our agent as well as a local contact in Turkey (hugely valuable), and were given fantastic guides.

Turkey is a seemingly intimidating country with such a long history and rich culture that it can feel a bit overwhelming to plan an itinerary that will touch on its many facets. However, Travel Shop Turkey was able to give us a sufficient introduction to Turkish history and culture in just a week's time. We saw interesting local attractions with an informative narrative courtesy of our guide, Turgay. He made each place come alive, and he offered insights on Turkish life, then and now. He was very, very accommodating, and gave his best effort to make the most of our time in each place, and even planning our daily itinerary as efficiently as possible.

I have to mention about our guide(Mr. \u00c7o\u015fkun) who was with us throughout the trip has been very knowledgeable and very kind person. We felt that he is one of us only.

I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to Travel shop for organizing such a fantastic trip to Turkey. It was smooth and thorough. And I would especially like to thank our guide Mr. Hasan who made our trip a memorable one. He was very friendly and knowledgeable. His presence made the history of Turkey alive and intrigued us even more into its culture. We were grateful for his guidance and patience. We hope to return again in future."

We (My family and I) spent 9 days and 8 nights in Turkey visiting Istanbul, Ephesus, Pamukkale and Cappadocia. The three day stay in Istanbul was nothing short of ephemeral thanks to the organising by Travel Shop and the guide provided by them, Hasan.Hasan was our guide throughout the stay in Istanbul and he was a treat to be around. Not only is he knowledgeable about the history of Istanbul but also well informed about the current world affairs. He had an answer to every relevant or irrelevant question we shot at him. On the first day of the tour, we visited the Hippodrome, the Blue Mosque, Aya Sophia and Taksim Square. Along with us we had another British couple in the day tour who were fairly old and the lady had to be pushed around in a wheel chair. Given all the walking demanded on that day, Hasan was kind enough to push the lady around giving the Gentleman some rest. He was polite, amiable and ensured that we got enough time at each place to admire the beauty and take the grandeur all inside. He organised the tour impeccably ensuring that we nibbled food at the right time and suggested great places which would cater to our taste. He also advised us to ride the local means of transport and get an experience of the same, which in my opinion was wonderful. He gave us clear directions which ensured that we faced no hassle. On the second day of the tour, we went for the Bosphorous cruise and then to the spice bazaar. Since he picked us up early, he took us to the highest point in Istanbul which had a surreal view of the whole city. It wasn't a part of our itinerary and I am glad he made it happen since view was dreamlike from the top. Given how friendly he is, he was more than glad to answer our not-so-imperative questions regarding the movies, sports, education in Turkey. It felt like we were spending the time with our friend rather than a guide. He is hysterical and ensured that our time on the cruise was informative as well as fun., He was patient enough to put up with our shenanigans when it came to clicking pictures. (Thanks for that Hasan!) He catered to the different schedules of everyone on the tour impeccably and ensured that we got dropped off at the airport on time. TL;DR : I highly recommend Hasan Oral for a tour guide. He is friendly, kind, laid back and extremely knowledgeable about all walks of life. I'm certain he'll make your stay pleasurable with his warm approach and abundance of patience. :)"

It was enhanced than we could have ever dreamed of! Everything worked out absolutely perfectly and it was almost flawless! We had no problems whatsoever, whenever is there any issue you people resolved it respectfully and efficiently.Ms. Derya did a marvelous job of keeping us update from the very beginning of planning may be sometimes I asked so many questions and changed plan but she replied and solved it nicely ; even during visiting she updated on time arrangement that was very personable and easy to travel with. The drivers and tour guides were all fantastic, reliable and made us feel completely comfortable specially I want to mention the guide from Channakale /Gallipoli/Troy , Pamukkale (The Lady) and Cappadocia (Mr.Samit) they delivered the service from their heart and I should say they have the most important part of customer service its \u2018soft skill\u2019 and their service is with human touch not like other robotic guide . The hotels were upright- we really felt like we were getting the decent treatment! Everything went perfectly with all of the domestic flights too.So again, we must sincerely thank you for setting up this most incredible trip of a lifetime for us! It definitely far exceeded our expectations. We already have friends who want to contact you to set up a trip just like ours!"

            "review": "Not so satisfying trip to Turkey and Greece. We had Travelshop organize a custom 14 day trip to Turkey and Greece for a part of 8 (7 Adults and a baby). First let me highlight the positives, the tour guides were very good and friendly. They had great knowledge of the areas and shared a lot of information with a lot of passion. The private airport transfers that were organized were spacious and nice and very comfortable. Now I want to share the not so good feedback that I experienced. We were a large group of 7 Adults and 1 Baby and needed a lot of coordination. Hence I was in touch with your agents two months before the trip, to make sure all the details are taken care of. Unfortunately that did not happen. Here is the list of things that did not go according to plan for us:1. Our tour package provided said Breakfast included every morning. We landed in turkey and next day in the morning waiting for breakfast but were told, sorry no breakfast included. That was a mistake2. The tour times were not communicated for Cappadocia and Greece and we were left wondering what do we do for the day3. I had told the operator that my Athens (place of stay) has changed four times. He told me that he will take care of it. I land in Athens and the driver took me to the old address4. My ferry tickets from Santorini to Athens, I had requested an upgrade. I was told by the operator that they were upgraded. We go to the boat to find out one ticket was not upgraded. My ticket was not upgraded and it was a huge inconvenience to manage my infant sitting in a different seat.Overall the written communication by the staff was not very good and most of the assurances were not right. The Greece leg was badly planned and if Travel shop turkey could not do Greece the agent should not have committed to doing it."

I found TravelShop Turkey in the web, while searching for All Inclusive Vacations to Bodrum, Turkey.I contacted them by email, back in May, inquiring about their services. The next day I received an email from Me. Murtaza Kalender, the CEO of the company, explaining their services and their credentials.Two days later, I received another email. This time from Orhan Kalender. Orhan explained in details their services and vacation packages. When I told him that we were going to spend 1 week in Istanbul, prior to going to Bodrum, he even offered his helpin finding a suitable hotel for us there. I haven't booked our vacation to Bodrum from the states. Upon arriving in Istanbul, we went to TraveShop Turkey offices to book our All Inclusive Vacation in person.There, we were greeted by the Manager of the company, who showed us to Orhan's office. I have to say that I was impressed by Orhan's hospitality and his eagerness to make our vacation a memorable one. He had 4 of his agents working on making all the necessary reservations for our vacation, plane, hotel , attraction tours, while Orhan himself tried to find out what tours would we enjoy most and all the while entertaining us with drinks of our choice. He even treated us to lunch while his agents we scrambling to put our package together, as we wanted to leave for Bodrum the next day. After a few hours of real hard work of all the staff involved, our vacation was booked.The next day, Orhan sent an SUV to pick us up and take us to the airport. The same thing happened at the Bodrum airport, the driver and the SUV were waiting for us to take us to the hotel.At the hotel, our room was overlooking the pool and the ocean - BREATHTAKING VIEW -.Everyday, Orhan would call us to confirm the next day's tour and the pickup time. All the tours we hadwere private tours-just for us. The drivers/guides were very professional and knowledgable about the attractions.Orhan has put together an unforgettable vacation for us. The best money I have ever spent!!!Thank you very much, Orhan, for everything!!!I will definitely recommend TravelShop Turkey to all who are planning to visit Turkey."

We used this agent to book us trip to Turkey including a private tour of Ephesus with pickup at Kusadasi port and one night Kusadasi, drop off at Izmir airport after the tour, flights to Kayseri, three nights Cappadocia and hot air ballooning, flights to Istanbul and one night in Istanbul.It was a special occasion trip (20th wedding anniversary) and the travel agent communicated this to all our hotels and we had great rooms and some complimentary touches like champagne in Istanbul and a cake from the Ciragan Palace plus very nice views and rooms from our other two hotels. We were also very pleased with the hot air balloon company they chose and the private Ephesus tour arranged. We do not usually use an agent to make bookings but book online ourselves but in this case we wanted to have a hassle free holiday and someone else taking care of all the details and this is exactly what we got. In terms of price I do not believe it cost us any more to use an agent and in fact we seemed to get better quality rooms than if we had booked independently. All our transfers were included. We used regular email and mobile phone contact to get in touch to get pickup times and this worked well. I would recommend you have a mobile phone with you so the agent can call you to advise updates on pick up times. There was an initial confusion over our Kusadasi port pickup but this got sorted fairly quickly once we called the agent. All in all we would recommend this as well as hassle free way to go. Just make sure you specify exactly what you want and what quality room you expect and ensure this all goes down in your quote if you are making a private tour arrangement since particularly in Cappadocia the rooms vary widely. We had a Fairy Chimney Suite which was magical and particularly requested it since there are limited suites available and every guest wants one."

I can not avoid mentioning the sense of humor which characterized Hasan. Although our staying was a short one, we had the chance to visit Blue Mosque, Hagia Sophia, Great Bazar, The Hill of Lovers. We had the chance to have a dinner on boat associated with a magnificent show, another dinner under the bridge of Gallata with sea food and another one at tavern Tasan Arkat associated with an unforgettable show. We also had the chance to experience a boat trip during the day in Bosporus Straight ... hey I can not name all the activities we did there but I can say for sure that was worth it for the money we paid. Hasan Oral our guide at the end of the tour has become part of our group that much that when we parted at the airport we told him, of course joking, \"Are you not coming with us\". Hasan Oral is a very honest, respectful and intelligent guide I have ever seen up to now, and a great ambassador for Turkey to the world of tourism, and I thank him for that and also suggest him to others as a guide."

I booked before it was decided that there was going to be a ballot. When it was first mentioned that there was going to be a ballot I phoned and spoke to a guy that said \" it is our land we have been taking people to Anzac Cove for over 20yrs. We would not need a ticket in the ballot because we were booking direct with a Turkish travel agent. Well that turned out to be not true. I sent emails enquiring about what would be offered for those that did not get tickets in the ballot. I then phoned and spoke to a guy who told me that they were going to be hiring a block of land near the site and that they were going to be setting up big screens. I was told that the broadcast would be from ABC in Australia. The problem with Travelshopturkey is that they are very bad in returning your emails. TravelshopTurkey did not provide what they had said. We were in a hall. There was no grass outside and the big screen was very small. The connection kept dropping out and it was a very badly organised event. My husband is an Army veteran of nearly 24 yrs and he had been looking forward to this for many years. The next morning we left at 9.00am to go on the coach to pick the Aussies and Kiwis up. Our guide originally told us that we were leaving at 1.00pm. This was a total waste of a day. This is not how I expected to spend our Anzac Day. This was the worst Anzac Day that we have ever had. There were 6 of us who did not get tickets to the ballot. We actually left one guy behind who was not at the hall at 9.00am. The guide said he has my number. The bus had broken seats on it from the start of the tour. When my husband told the guide that there were broken seats she was very nasty and said that they were not broken at the beginning of the tour. She said that they must have been broken when they took people to Anzac Cove. The bus driver got lost several times and he did not adhere to the road signs. He went through lots of reds lights and stop signs. The first couple of days of the tour we did not get to the hotel until 9.30pm and later and then we had to have dinner. When I got back from the tour I sent a review of my tour to Ozcan. He was very slack in replying to my emails. He then said that he had to check things with our guide. This is when things turned ugly. The guide accused my husband of deliberately breaking the coach seats so that he could complain. This is not true. The guide also said that we had lost a relative just before our tour and that was why we were not happy. This is also another lie. I phoned Ozcan and spoke to him. He then told me that the reason why we were not outside was because of the cold. He said that in the years 2012, 2013 and 2014 they had to take people to the hospital because of the cold. Well we expected it to be cold we even hired sleeping bags which cost us 25 Euros each. All the other people that had tickets in the.ballot were outside!!!! Ozcan can not be trusted he tells you one thing on the phone then does not do it. He has so many excuses for not replying to your emails. Some of his excuses are he had problems with his computer. The final straw came when he emailed on Saturday 25 July and asked me to contact another person who was on our tour and to ask them to remove their review. He said that I had until Tuesday 28 July or he was going to contact TripAdvisors head office. That is very unprofessional. Turkey is a beautiful country and I recommend everyone to go and visit. The only thing I would advise is to not use TravelshopTurkey. This review is 100% true."

To be honest I did not believe it would be possible to do it and it would probably cost a fortune. We are a family of 3 and the cost was a big factor for us.I emailed Travelshop Turkey after comings across their website. I can honestly say from the first email I received back from the CEO Mr. Murtaza Kalender this company really looked after us.He appointed Ms.Ozlem Binay to correspond with us.Ms.Binay was brilliant sorting a 2 day Istanbul Tour for us.On 8 July at 5am we were collected from our hotel and driven to Izmir Airport.The driver was a gentleman. We flew to Istanbul with Turkish Airlines (breakfast included on 50 minute flight). We were collected at Istanbul airport by our tour guide. We had one stop to collect 4 more people and our tour began.The tour guide was excellent (not to forget our wonderful driver who gave us plenty of water) and we got to see the Blue Mosque, Hagia Sofia and the Topkapi Palace. We broke for lunch and then went to the Grand Bazaar. We were driven to the Dedeman Hotel for our overnight stay.The next morning after breakfast we were picked up from our hotel and brought to the highest point in the City to see the wonderful views. Next we went to the Spice Bazaar (Egyptian Bazaar). Then we were taken on a cruise of the Bosphorus. After lunch we were driven to the airport. We flew back to Izmir and collected by our driver.The driver stopped at a shop and bought water for us. We really felt this was a really nice thing to do,especially as our flight was delayed and he had to wait over 2 hours for us.We arrived back at the Palmin, Kusadasi, at 11.50pm,after a wonderful trip.We also booked Travelshop Turkey to bring us to Izmir Airport when returning home.We cannot praise this company enough. Thanks to all at Travelshop Turkey. True professionals.

Was told conflicting information, told the information I was getting in NZ was incorrect. (Actually was correct, tour company has incorrect information )When the tour finally started the stress just increased. Bus driver got lost going to every hotel, tour guide even got into an argument so bad with the driver she went to throw her phone away. Guide didn't know what we were doing the next day most of the time and would be on the phone calling head office. When you enquired about your extras, half the time she had no idea. I was made to feel like I held the group up because I added on an option. When I tried to add on the Turkish bath in Istanbul I was told all afternoon was not enough time, to find out that evening a group had gone at 2pm.... We had a free day and were given no options from our tour guide as to what there was to do. You were expected to do your own research and make your own bookings. Isn't that what the tour guide is for.... Overall the worst tour company I have ever dealt with. I even left the tour with mouth ulcers. After I returned home I raised my concerns with the company but overall I did not receive satisfactory response. Once they have your money and you are gone they couldn't care less.DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY. Especially if you want a relaxing low stress tour."

In the short span of 5 days, we were able to see the beautiful countryside along the coastal city of Kusadasi, visit the ancient ruins of Ephesus, as well as cover the major tourist spots in Istanbul such as the Haga Sophia, the Blue Mosque, the Topkapi and Dolmabachi palaces and many more. Even traveling with small children, we felt no struggle or discomfort as our schedule was planned, to have ample time for rest and relaxation, All thanks and credit to the planning of our tour consultant, Mr. Gokhan Kalender (highly recommended). Our tour guide, Mr. Turgay Polat (highly recommended), also arranged by travelshop turkey, was exceptionally informative, friendly and accommodating with our rather large group. 1.

Onr Koc our consultant was so efficient and thorough, even telephoned us in Australia to reassure us of our 5 day tailor made itinerary. They collected us from instanbul port and arranged a private tour of the palace. Spice bazar with Hansen, who was exceptional and a fun good English speaking guide. Following day we flew to Cappadocia for one night and stayed in a cave, had the hot air balloon ride and Turkish bath! All a must do! Wish we had gone there for an extra night as one of the best places we had been to out of 7 countries we visited so far. Following on from that we went to Gallipoli for the day, which was good but tiring as such a long way, should have stayed overnight but we were on a tight schedule. Following day transferred to airport for the rest of our trip. We had a couple of problems which we our fault but wonderful travel shop Turkey made everything good! We loved Turkey, felt safe and such a beautiful clean place. Thank you to onur and Hansen for making our time in Turkey the most memorable and special time. We will definitely be back.

I found Travel Shop Turkey on the internet while searching for a travel agency that would take us to Pumakkale while our cruise ship docked at Kusadasi for 12 hours - quite a few Turkish travel agencies would not do this due to various reasons. From the moment I contacted Travel Shop Turkey to the minute we finished our private tour, we received prompt, professional, patient, knowledgeable services. Agent Onur Koc replied my enquiries with details and patience. He made careful arrangements that suited the needs of my parents (in their mid-80s) well. The owner/CEO of the company, Murtaza Kalender, followed up on my enquiries even though he was tending to his business in India. Tour guide Birol Goksudelik took a 12-hour bus ride from Istanbul to take us on our day trip to Pumakkale and Ephesus. The agency made arrangement for Birol Goksudelik to receive us because he speaks Chinese (my parents are Chinese nationals). He did not disappoint us. In fact, he impressed us with his knowledge of the sites, the region and the country, his personable approach and his professionalism. He was very curteous and accommodating towards my parents. We very much enjoyed our private tour due to the excellent services from Travel Shop Turkey."

Since we were travelling on standby tickets in May2015, which is high season from India, it was difficult for me to confirm a hotel room because I would not know till the last minute if we would be boarding the flight. I explained my situation to Mr Arin and he told me not to worry. When I boarded the flight all I did was send him a whatsapp message & that was all I had to do, I couldn't believe when I stepped out of the IST airport, I seen Mr Arin waiting for me with my name placard. What followed after that was a very pleasant holiday in Istanbul, we enjoyed our stay at Hotel Momento which he arranged for us and also the tour which was provided.

The overall experience was good I have suggested many friends and family to visit Turkey with Travelshop. My Travel agent Riza was very polite and patiently answered all my questions. The hotels were nice and centrally located. They have their own tour guide and vehicle in Istanbul but for rest of the places they arranged with different tour agents. From entire trip, 3 tour guides were very good and had excellent knowledge on the subject. Yuke (pronounced as UK) in Istanbul, Nizam in Ephesus and Zu in Cappadocia. Istanbul day tour was good. Yuke is really very kind and helpful girl. Both the days she suggested very good restaurants to us. She is very sensible and professional - We had a family (couple + small kid) with us in the tour and during Bospherous cruise they wanted to sit inside and my husband and I preferred sitting outside but Yuke made sure that she attends both of us though it was bit of an extra efforts for her to explain everything to both of us separately. If you take a day tour in Istanbul then ask for Yuke to be your guide and you will be pleased and satisfied with her service :) The only reason I have not given Travelshop 5 star is because of few issues I had which could have been avoided. If you are booking with them - take care of these points1. Because no tour guide would travel with us, I was concern how to contact Travelshop if anything goes wrong? I was been assured that they will give me mobile so I can contact them whenever I want. Unfortunately that was a false promise! I was not given any phone and couple of times it was difficult to confirm tour pick times etc. I am a perfectionist and this was bit annoying for me at that time. 2. I was promised that max group size will be 15. However, on Green Tour in Cappadocia I was part of the group of 26 people in a bus which I would definitely not except from Travelshop.I thought someone from Travelshop would contact me after my return and ask for my experience but no one did that! I could not do balloon ride so I was expecting a refund into my account but it has been more than 2 weeks since I am back from turkey but I still don't have refund. But there is a positive point also that when I reported that, they apologized and promised that refund will be done soon so it should be fine.Turkey is a very nice place to visit..Happy holidays!!"

As against many industry led FAM trips where the operator sets out to impress, the strength and value of this trip was that the itinerary, accommodation and meals were exactly the same as the normal tour offered by Travel Shop. Severe snow storms necessitated a change in plans and route, and the overnight accommodation was changed twice en route for safety reasons - but full marks to Gokhan and Torguy for their efforts and for keeping us in the loop. They offer an extensive range of sightseeing and overnight tour options, and I am happy to recommend them for any person considering Turkey as a destination."

I not only visited the most beautiful sites in Turkey but also stayed in the wonderful hotels such as Bosphorus Park Hotel, White Heaven Hotel... Gokhan Kalendar operated the tour so well, and more importantly, he was so flexible in coordinating with the Guide Turgay to find out the best solution for the group when we were facing to the bad weather.

During these days we learned from our guide partial history of Turkey from Byzantine Era up to Modern Turkey known as Kamal Era, he almost covered the history of Byzantine,Ottomans, Greek. In addition to, we enjoyed some magnificent views both inland and out at the sea under the guidance of our Guide and he lead us to good restaurant and taste of traditional Turkish street food and Turkish delight and also he took us to some additional places around the area to try some special Turkish dishes."

I was very happy with how quickly the tour agent would reply back to me. The prices were pretty good as well, and I liked that they showed the price for single occupancy as well as double occupancy. Since I was travelling alone, it was nice to know all the prices up front. I booked the tour after a few emails back and forth to confirm all the details of my trip.When I got to Ataturk airport, I was hoping someone would be there to pick me up, as this was confirmed in my email before leaving for my trip. And yes, there was someone there to pick me up =). I was given a cellphone that I could use locally throughout my trip, if anything were to happen. All the tour agents phone numbers were on the phone as well. The day tours were great. I was always told at what time I would be picked up by my tour guide, and they were usually on time. All my tour guides (yes, I had different tour guides for the different cities/regions that I visited) were incredibly insightful and spoke good English. The day tour groups were no larger than 10 people, and for my first couple of tours, I was alone, so I had private tour! After each tour, I would always be driven back to either the same hotel or to the next hotel that I was to stay at. I was worried that I would always be carrying my luggage around, but they store it in their van (used by the day tour).For the bus ride to Cappadocia, and then the one back to Istanbul, I was always given a bus ticket by the tour guide, or given clear directions on where to go to get my ticket. Although I had the option to take the plane to go to and from Cappadocia, I chose the bus. I would not do that again though. It wasn't really comfortable, and got either really cold or really hot on the bus (it was the Metro bus company).I was also staying in Istanbul for a few days after my tour ended, and my tour operator gladly booked and included that price for me. There were absolutely no surprise fees during my stay. Any extra fees (such as drinks, or buying dinner at the hotel) was always explicitly stated by the tour guides.Overall, I am really happy that I went ahead and booked my tour with Travel Shop Turkey. I was honestly expecting some mishaps to happen, but nothing went wrong! I thoroughly enjoyed all the locations I visited (Istanbul, Gallipoli, Troy, Ephesus, Kusadasi, Canakkale, Pamukkale, Goreme, Cappadocia region). The best one is Cappadocia though, in my opinion. I think I will probably come back to Turkey and visit all the other regions I didn't do, and I will definitely use Travel Shop to organize my stay in the future.Thanks!"

Headline - Not what is says on the Box.....My partner and I just spent the week on the Travel Shop Turkey Istanbul tour.The trip was 6 days over Xmas and included a raft of different daily activities, Travel shop sorted the hotel, transfers and then each days activities.Summary - Istanbul is an amazing place but one that in 6 days I feel we could have done so much better had we not been on this tour, as it was we finished the week feeling short changed. By far the best things we did were the during the time we had to ourselves. In fact so much so we blew off the last day of the tour (Bosphoros Cruise) and instead did a backstreet food tour, best day on the trip!Positives;- Hotel Momento was very nice and in a great location. Room was very small (only open suitcases on the bed) but this is common throughout Europe. Staff were nice, hotel was modern and well decorated. Great location in the old city only a few hundred meters from the Grand Bazaar. Be aware though that there are limited food/drink options around here at night, most of the variety and better options are over in the Taksim area.- Bus drivers were all very good, on time and sociable even through language barriers.- We were given a local mobile phone with numbers to contact anyone we needed.- Couple and their son who we spent most of the activities with.- Entertainment at the Gar a Turkish dinner and show evening. The Food was very poor compared to everything else we ate but the entertainment (dancing, singing etc...) was good enough to make up for it.Negatives- No continuity in people we dealt with. On the activities that were guided we had a different person each time and none of them had any idea what the rest of our itinerary involved.- One day involved a 'city tour', however the main destination the Topkapi palace was closed even though it was advertised on our itinerary. Given the days were set around Xmas well in advance this should have been known. Although we did get to see the Hagia Sophia and Blue Mosque nothing replaced the palace and we were therefore finished by around noon. Day had started at 9am when we spent an hour on the bus after being picked up to collect the other people only to start the tour about a 10 minute walk from our Hotel.- Tour included a guided shopping day, a quote from the itinerary; \"We will make a shopping tour in which you will be aware of the ancient arts of Turkey like carpet weaving, leather manufacturing and jewellery. As this will be a guided tour, you will avoid being hassled which will enable you enjoy the shopping experience whilst gaining the knowledge of the ancient craftsman.\" What this was in practice - Dropped and left at a mall for 2 hours and then taken to the Grand Bazaar where we were taken to one overpriced Turkish delight store. This was definitely a waste of a day and a low light of our week.- Turkish baths although a great experience didn't know the women were coming and had to spend 10 minutes getting the driver to call people to talk to them to sort it out.- The itinerary also stated that on one day \"Enjoy a big xmas feast of rich Turkish cuisine and party the night away with your new friends\" but this actually meant feel free to organise and pay for your own meal. The next day had something very similar written and this was an organised dinner with Turkish entertainment."

I must say that they did a fabulous job in organizing the trip.The itinerary was comprehensive and very well outlined. The logistic arrangements were very well organized too. The hotels offered were carefully chosen with excellent locations. Our last stop was at Cappadocia Cave city and stay at the Gamirasu Cave resort which was like icing on the cake. Excellent resort and hospitality. TravelShop had also organized the Hot Air Balloon for us at Cappadocia. This is the one of the best places in the world to do hot air balloon. We had a good Tour Guide who took us around all over. In Turkey you have to be sure that you chose the right kind of itinerary as otherwise you can be driving for long distances. Our drive from Antalya to Cappadocia was indeed long but enroute at Konya we stopped at the mausoleum of Jalal ad-Din Muhammad Rumi, a Persian Sufi mystic which made it well worth the drive. Alternately you can also take a flight.A journey is made special only when there is a human touch to it and for us it was TravelShop Turkey!! A special mention to the staff of Travel Shop- Ms Alicia Hern\u00e1ndez & Mr Gokhan Kalender. Not only were they prompt but gave comprehensive responses each time. Our Best wishes to them in showcasing this beautiful country to the whole world. Congratulation to Murtaza Kalender for a fantabulous job and team!!"

            "review": "Travelshop Turkey Tours. We are a retired couple from Toronto and went on line to find a reputable tour company, that has been around for several years, to organize a nice upmarket tour of a few regions within Turkey covering 14 - 17 days. We narrowed it down to 3 tour companies and got proposals from each of them. In the end we chose Travelshop Turkey, because of : Service Quality, Price, Tour Ideas, Reputation from tour reviews by various travellers.Derya Cetin organized our tour and she did a great job. We made specific requests (e.g. no jewellery shops, pottery shops, carpet shops, etc so we didn't waste valuable time in tourist traps that used hard sell techniques. We also asked for private tour guides, flights (not buses) between cities, focus on historical and cultural visits, specific hotels. All our requests were accommodated without exception. Its nice to work with someone who listens to their client so well.We spent a total of 15 days in Turkey: 7 in Istanbul (5 at the beginning and 2 at the end), 3 in Kusadasi, 2 in Antalya, 3 in Cappdocia.We can highly recommend the Four Seasons Hotel in Sultanahmet -- great location in the old town and easy walking distance to several key spots (Hagia Sophia, Blue Mosque, Topkapi, Grand Bazaar, lots of great restaurants). Fantastic staff who are well trained and will do everything to make your stay special. Its well worth the extra cost vs. other hotels nearby. Ask for a room overlooking the courtyard.In Kusadasi we stayed at the Korumar Deluxe Hotel. Photos were great when we picked the hotel, but after our stay we give it a thumbs down. Not that clean and in need of some renovation / updating. Also, the staff were not helpful. Its a shame as the location and views are fantastic. In Antalya we stayed at the Rixos Downtown hotel. Very nice hotel and would also recommend this one. Its more of a business hotel, but it has nice facilities and a nice pool in a park setting. Ask for a sea view room.In Cappadocia we stayed at the Argos Hotel. Really unique place with a great restaurant. Built into the the large hill side in village of Uchisar, it has magnificent views. Very helpful staff. Ask for a room with a view.In Cappadocia, we went on a hot air balloon ride arranged by Travelshop Turkey with Goreme Balloons. Very professional group with good equipment, we had a very experienced pilot and a good safety briefing before hand. Highly recommend this experience.The guides assigned to us were:For Istanbul Part : Coskun For Kusadasi Part : Bahar For Antalya & Cappadocia Part : Ozgur All of them were excellent. They were very knowledgeable about history of their respective areas, restaurants, specialty shopping including artwork. Ozgur, in particular, was special -- we really enjoyed his passion for his country, as well as his exceptional knowledge about culture and history.A nice surprise thrown in by Derya was the private boat trip around the Bosphorus. We were expecting to be on a boat with lots of other tourists, but on arrival at the boat it was just us. Didn't expect that so it was a nice treat.We were driven around by very experience drivers in clean, fairly new Mercedes vans with lots of room.Overall, I would highly recommend Travelshop Turkey and Derya Cetin to organize your tour in Turkey. However, make sure you do your homework first so you know what kind or a trip you want and were you want to go (and not go) so that Derya tailors your trip to your specific preferences. We found Turkey to be a wonderful place to visit with very friendly people and tremendous history to explore."

Hasan's hospitality and Knowledge was excellent! he made the trip worthwhile! i would definately recommend his to fellow travellers! the history and culture and knowledge you will experience is worth it all! day 2 was experiencing the bhosphorous tour and looking onto european turkey from asia turkey! this was breathtaking! our trip to spice bazaaar was expensive though! we spent \u00a363 on a small box of turkish delight! we had no idea we had over paid until we got back to marmaris and realised turkish delight was offered at around 15 Liras for a small box! a little annoyed that Hasan had promised us over the two days to take us to his cheap shops for gifts. not cheap for us then!overall as long as you dont do the stupid act of paying for turkish delight for its weight in gold! lol! worth the sightseeing and historical knowledge you will gain! i wont visit turkey again but i will definately recommend this tour to others. when we got back to marmaris we told everyone we met about the tour and many people were shocked as they had been coming to marmaris for over 10 years but never knew about trips to istanbul!"

The Bosphorus trip was superb, we went on board the ferry on the Asian side of the waterway, traveling towards the Black Sea and then back to The Golden Horn where we disembarked. This was followed by a visit to the Spice Market and the New Mosque with next a delicious meal for lunch. During the afternoon we went to the Blue Mosque and Hagia Sofia museum, finishing with a return drive to our Hotel. A wonderful day in Istanbul!"

We were a group of 20 adults and 5 children very warmly received by Orhan Kalendar at Ataturk International airport in Istanbul. Our next stop was the Travel Shop Turkey offices as we had to wait for the rest of the group who were travelling from Mombasa to arrive. Welcomed by Murtaza Kalendar and after our first cup of Turkish Tea, Orhan took us to breakfast at a cafe near their offices and thereafter to the shopping area nearby to kill time before we returned to the airport for our flight to Antalya. We met our guide Turgay at the airport and Orhan, Turgay and Sadik checked us all in while we comfortably waited. This was just the beginning!!The next few days we spent in Antalya visiting the Aspendos Theatre, Old City Kaleici, a boat trip out onto the Mediterranean Sea and we also opted to watch Fire of Anatolia the theatrical musical which was well worth the extra fee!We moved on to Kusadasi and visited Ephesus, the ancient city, Sirinche village and finished off with our visit to a Turkish leather factory and Turkish carpet weaving centre which also provided a lot of knowledge and insight in production of the two commodities eventually moving on to an onyx factory where we saw various end products of this beautiful stone and even indulged in buying some gemstone jewellery! Next on our agenda was Pamukkale,the beautiful blue and white calcium terraces surrounded by the ruins of the Hierapolis which was original founded as an ancient spa.From Kusadasi, we returned to Istanbul where we visited Hagia Sophia, Topkapi Palace, the Blue Mosque, Suleimania Mosque, the Ancient Hippodrome where one can see the Obelisk of Theodosius, The Serpentine Column and the Column of Constantine, the Grand Bazaar and the Spice Market. Also on our tour itinerary were the Bosphorus Dinner cruise and the Turkish 1001 nights Dinner show which included great entertainment.All in all we had an awesome trip and even extended it from 12 days to 15 days which enabled us experience a trip to Prince's Island and enjoy the horse carriage tour around the island, Eyup Sultan and a ride in the cable cars up to Pierre Loti Hill where we could view all of Istanbul.Thank you Orhan & Sadik and everyone at Travel Shop Turkey for an amazing experience and a big thumbs up to our awesome guide Turgay!! We will definitely visit Turkey again soon,"

The best thing that i liked was that we were given a mobile which kept us updated about our transfers and pick ups. Also, to mention the professionalism by Sadik and i would say the best tour guides that is Murat who helped us with our flight boarding and Nizammuddin who has been very informative and well versed with the history of Turkey."

While planning/booking the trip, communication via email was clear and prompt. Our guide ORHAN was excellent!! He met us at the meeting point on time, and drove us to our destination in a VIP van (which was an experience in itself!). He spoke English very well, he was friendly and he always made sure we were comfortable.Upon arrival, he gave us a nice bit of time to walk around and explore the beautiful surroundings of the area. The area is green and lush. We had the advantage of picking fruits and berries right off the trees!! Orhan personally took photos of us from the moment we arrived till the moment we left and later on offered us the photos on a CD for free!!! There were over 500 beautifully captured photos. While viewing these, we were speechless!! We cannot thank him enough. This was a huge bonus!!!!The facilities were excellent. They consisted of beautiful wooden cabins, a sitting/eating area and clean bathrooms.The package we purchased included breakfast and lunch, both of which were delicious, fresh and filling. Breakfast was traditional Turkish, and lunch had a bit of everything (salads, pasta, rice, barbecued chicken, bread, etc..)After breakfast we were taken to get our wetsuits and rafting equipment, we then had to sit and wait for a while till the mini bus came to transfer us to the river bank. The ride was nerve-wrecking to say the least. The bus was literally on the edge of the winding road and the driver was speeding like crazy. Orhan was not driving here, but someone else. This was by far the worst part of the trip.Another letdown was the fact the the pre-rafting safety instructions were given only in Turkish. As non-turkish speaking people, this left us a little uneasy, especially those of us who were about to go rafting for their first time. Nonetheless, we managed to get the basics translated to us by a fellow traveler and things went fairly smooth.The rafting trip itself was obviously the highlight. It was lots of fun and the rapids were nice and strong in some areas, and slower in others. Although the water was murky, we went for a little swim in the very cold water!After rafting, there were somewhat primitive shower facilities available, which were O.K.Our guide Orhan waited for us near the cabin area and met us once we were done rafting. He had previously allowed us to store our belongings in his van and assured us this was safe, which it was. After cleaning up and getting dressed, there was the lunch buffet just as mentioned in the package description on their website http://www.travelshopturkey.com/Orhan drove us home and was even kind enough to offer us another outing the following day which we took him up on. He took us to a nice fish restaurant in Kumkapi, on which I will write a seperate review.I am so glad we booked our rafting trip with Travelshop Turkey. They are very friendly and highly professional! I would recommend their services to anyone planning a trip to Turkey. Orhan's hospitality blew us away! He let us take our time and we never felt rushed! Thanks to him, we had an amazing experience from begining to end."

He was very helpful and took all my smallest inquiry seriously.everything was booked and well looked after. The tours were well managed especially The Greece tour. Istanbul was good too. Just one suggestion - In Greece I would prefer a better hotel for the 4 start standard...The service was exceptional but the rooms and toilet were not upto mark.I would definetly recommend TravelShop if you want to go to Turkey and Greece.

Ozan is a fantastic tour guide with just the right balance between professionalism and approachability. His in-depth knowledge and obvious dedication to his country and his heartfelt portrayal of its beautiful and rich culture and history helped to personalise the trip for us and gave us a greater appreciation of everything that Turkey has to offer. Turkey itself is a country located right on one of the most important water way trade routes in history. So here you have a taste of all the histories and architecture that the neighbouring European and Asian civilisations have to offer in a place that is really quite inexpensive to get to and to visit!I highly recommend the 12 hour bus trip from Istanbul to get to Kapadokya, the hot springs and a dip in Cleopatra's Pool in Pammukale, and if you're an Aussie or a Kiwi, the Rememberence services at Gallipoli are certainly a once in a lifetime, must-see-and-do experience. Highest on my list of things to do though, is an authentic Turkish Bath (Hamam) experience. I can promise you, Turkey is TOTALLY worth it!"

Our guide, Ozgur - was remarkable not only being a great Guide, but showing us the way of life in Turkey with a good mix of fun & jokes. We certainly miss him.Thanks Travel Shop Turkey for a great & memorable honeymoon."

Well 3 days are too short a period but wherever we visited we returned informed and entertained, thanks to our guide. It would have been much better had we had a more informed guide because there was so much to know. Visiting countries I I have realised that a guide is a true ambassador. If the guide is good, well-informed and a story teller you can fall in love with the country. The same happened during this visit. I will cherish the recording of azaan I did during my visit to Blue Mosque and the pictures of tulip all over the city. A word about the azaan: It was soul touching and I have shared it with my friends. Being my second visit I have learned one thing: Don't buy costly stuff from The Grand Bazar or Spice Bazar. They're exorbitantly priced. You can get the stuff you're looking for in established shops in the city elsewhere at a fraction of the same."

The service leading up to the tour and during was top notch. Hicri Tosun, was very quick to respond to any of my questions and also fun to work with. The operations while we were on the tour was smooth as well. They also give out a cell phone at the start of the tour in case you need to contact your guide or the main office. What a great touch! Our guide Ozan was fantastic. You could tell how seriously he took his job and how much he wanted to make sure each of us had a great experience."

We (Me,My Wife & a cousin) went to Turkey Covering Istanbul, Cannakkale, Kusadasi, Pamukkale and Antalya.The above all places were covered by a 12 seater luxury coach with a Professional Guide Serkan Aydin .He was at its best and had great in-depth knowledge of all historic places. He made us so comfortable and easy in our trip & became a real part of our family. We being from India and being Jain family have lots of food restriction (We are vegetarian & also we don\u2019t eat underground roots like potato onion garlic etc,). He was always there enquiring about our food requirements & tried his level best to procure the same. His patience is commendable. On the way we took many photo stops which he happily obliged without any fuss. We can ask him anything under the sun and he would reply with a real humility & conviction. The driver of the coach whom we used to call \u201cCaptain\u201d was also a very nice gentleman and always smiling and ready to help. He drove the coach so smoothly that we were never troubled by over speed or rash driving. Overall because of presence of such a guide and captain it added so much meaning to our trip. Also we had wonderful co-tour members from Cyprus & a young suave lady from Ahmedabad which added cultural flavors to the tour. We particularly enjoyed our last night at Antalya at amazing Pub in old city of Antalya. This was our first fully Escorted (hand tagged) tour and we had nice fun. We strongly recommend Travel Shop Turkey & their team for any trip to Turkey.Te-shukur-e-drim(Thank you) Turkiye !!!!"

We were picked up promptly at the airport on arrival and transported to the hotel. The sightseeing tours were planned and executed well. Even though it was a group tour, there was only one other couple with us. The tour guide was extremely knowledgeable in the history of Istanbul. It was very important to know the history since most attractions have a long history. The tour guide gave us enough time to spend at the attractions so we were never rushed. We could have done without the visits to Leather and Ceramic shops. The ceramic demonstration was good, We enjoyed and were flattered by the Leather/Fur jackets fashion show done for just four of us. But we were in no mood to spend $500 or more on the items in these stores. On the last day, Travelshop Van was at hotel on time to take us to the airport. Please note that at Istanbul airport, the carts are not free even at baggage claim on arrival. I had to exchange currency at airport just to get 1 Lira coin to pay for a cart to carry our 4 bags."

Our fears went away as soon as we met our guide, who is very friendly, helpful and passionate about his work. The result: An unforgettable vacation.

All the arrangements were perfectly done, right from pickup at Airport, hotel booking, our lunch and dinner at Indian restaurants to drop facility back at the airport. The only concern was at the Feronya Hotel, the room booking was done with not a proper window view and also atleast one drinking bottle when we checkedin hotel should have been complementary. Also the water bottle charged at Feronya was costly as compared to those available in supermarkets.Rest the trip arranged by Travelshop was simply amazing. Once again special thanks to Nurgul, who was just a phonecall away from us to take our care."

The tour guide was very good, his explanation of the attractions was thorough. The lunch was just so so, it was a buffet, but there was not much choice. The time of waiting before transferring to Denizli airport was a bit long, the trip was ended about 3, and we stayed in a hotel and wait for about an hour to airport, but since the flight back to istanbul was at 18:55, even if we went to airport we still need to wait, so it's ok. Perhaps a bit longer trip?\u2026 Although the tour guide presented a detailed plan of the tour when we were on the bus, I still think that it would be better that I can have a plan contained detailed time and place of the tour before the trip\u2026Anyway things were great, and the place was quite interesting.

They say well begun is half done, and co-ordinating the details of our trip to Istanbul with Mr Gokhan Kalendar of Travel Shop Turkey was an effortless, reassuring experience. And it sure began very well, with a swank Mercedes van waiting for us at Ataturk Airport for transfer to the hotel (superb Taksim location chosen by Travel Shop). Right from the moment we set off from the airport, through the three days of professionally conducted city tours, right to the return transfer in that luxe Mercedes - everything was planned to a T, and all we had to do was enjoy the Istanbul experience. After all, we had two continents to cover. And Travel Shop Turkey made it one memorable experience."

We travelled to Cappadocia, Antalya, Pamukkale, Kusadasi and Istanbul. We were total 5 family members and I should say that the tour organisation was very professional and superb. My ratings are based on following points:1) Logistics/Transfers/Pickups: Whether you are arriving at any particular destination late or before time, you will always find a Travelshop representative waiting at the gate for you. This is so important because in a foreign country if your tour agency representative is not present then a sense of fear creeps in. 2) Communications: The BEST. Replies from Nurhan were immediate and she was very accommodative, always keeping our comfort on priority. All the queries before tour were replied in time thru Skype. Also, during the tour, she was constantly in touch thru Skype & Whatsapp. Once during the tour she was available for us even at 9.30 in the night. That's amazing service.3) Hotels: We took the 5 star hotel package and the hotels were upto the mark, except in Antalya where the hotel-Sea Life was not so great.4) Mobile: The agency went one step ahead & provided a mobile phone with sim & credit in the phone for us so that we can communicate with our tour operator at any time. The phone had all the numbers pre-loaded in it. This was so thoughtful of Travelshop.5) Food: We opted for Jain Vegetarian food for our family. Proper full course Jain veg food was available 50% of the times. Rest of the times it was manageable, but no complaints.Finally, Thank you NURHAN OZBEK and Travelshop team for making our trip to Turkey a memorable one. Hope to see you again in future."

Although we were dropped back off to the airport a few hours early, which meant we had alot of waiting to do, it wasnt too bad. I guess I could have asked to contine at the park for an hour, but the tour guide wasnt sure of the traffic and didnt want us to get late for our flight. All in all it was a great experience and I will treasure the memories forever. I would strongly recommend Travel Shop Turkey to anyone interested in visiting Turkey."

Thanks to our tour guide Ozan Baykara, who made the trip very interesting by sharing the cultural and historical significance of the places we visited. Hot air balloon in Cappadocia and exploring the underground city in the vicinity was a wonderful experience. In Antalya, ruins of Aspendos theatre, Perge and Apollon Temples were breathtaking. We got a free day in Antalya, that is the time we went for scuba diving, which added excitement to our trip. Our 3rd destination in Turkey was Pamukkale, initially we were apprehensive about the place.. but I must say if you are in a big group and you want to chill out it is one of the best place to go. Pamukkale is known for its calcium rock formation and hot springs or say thermal pools, it is stunning to look at and is a great tourist spot. We reached Istanbul during Sacrifice, the city was adorned with lights. The Blue mosque and Hagia Sophia are the places I fall in love with. They are great architectures and a unique mix of Roman & Ottoman culture. The mosaics, ottoman treasures, the Arabic literature (I did not understood much but thanks to OZAN he made me understand few things) amazed my imagination. Last but not the least, thanks a lot to our tour guide Ozan, who make the trip much more interesting. He gave us enough time to relax and also told us what to buy and where to buy..

Hello from Canada!On behalf of our small group of five from the Ottawa area, we would all like to thank-you and congratulate you on the excellent job your agency did concerning our private tour consisting of Istanbul, Fethiye, Antalya and Cappadocia (September 13 -27, 2013). We want you to know that we had an excellent time and were very impressed with your efforts to coordinate the hotels, domestic air flights, airport transfers and local tours which all went very well. Providing your clients with a cellphone to communicate pick up and drop off times was an excellent idea to maintain contact during our two week visit.We must say that we were a little apprehensive booking the trip from Canada with a foreign travel agency, especially when submitting our respective credit card numbers for final payment. Also, we were a little afraid that there would be no one to greet us at the airport in Istanbul on arrival. Our fears were unfounded, however, when we were greeted by Nurgul of your staff who displayed a little sign in the arrival area with the name of one of our party to facilitate our meeting. From then on, everything seemed to go without a hitch.We would like to thank Mahir of your sales staff for his detailed itinerary and planning skills based on the regions we preferred to visit and his calm and courteous demeanor in answering our questions via Skype prior to our departure. We would also like to thank Nurgul for her informative city tour of Istanbul which was very interesting and gave us 'newcomers' the confidence we needed to explore the city on our own e.g. her recommendation for us to visit Taksim Square which, contrary to North American media reports earlier in the summer, turned out to be a very nice, pleasant city park.Finally, we would like to thank the driver who took us to Istanbul airport on our final day and who made a surprise 'detour' so one of us could visit 'Best Leather' to do some last minute shopping. It was most appreciated.\u00c7ok te\u015fekk\u00fcr ederim ve iyi yap\u0131lm\u0131\u015f bir i\u015f i\u00e7in tebrikler!

I had booked the hotel on my own, however, they went out of the way to call the hotel in advance, and tell them I would be on an early flight arrival, and arranged an early check-in! Like at 8 AM!

I work in summit bank and this year we planned a overseas Sales convention( 6 days) for our 35 star performers Summit Bank employees as a reward for their performance.There was an overwhelming response from all the staff to choose Turkey as a destination and i am glad we opt for it. We were in real haste how to arrange a best deal value for money for or our top 35 contenders from nation wide . We conducted our research and found out that the best avialable deals was provided by Travel Shop Turkey. We wanted this tour to be the best as we were traveling with our senior management and our star performers and all the arrangements responsibilities was on our shoulder. As we landed in Turkey and met our tour guide Miss Nurgul Uzan from that point till we flew back to Pakistan it was all entertainment and fun. We received such great services in tranfers , hotel accomadations and luches dinners and in all the planned itineary.Miss Nurgul Uzan is the best tour guide and the most wonderful person to have with you on the tour . She is friendly and i must say very patient indeed . A well informed person who knows about the places in Istanbul knew the history about all the places , plus she guided us about the shopping places and other activities which we could have never managed ourself. The arrangements of lunches, dinners night shows, black sea activity, Princess Island horse cart ride, cruise rides visits to cultural heritage places and bazars was all included in 6 day trip. We as a team was so much appraised from our top excutives and our performers for arranging this excursion tour which made us feel proud courtesy Travel Shop Turkey. So know i can bet on this that if you plan to visit Turkey there is no better tour operator than Travel Shop Turkey and there no other best guide than Miss Nurgul Uzan :) in Instanbul. Cheers!!"

In the beginning i made email contact with them to ask about a day tour of the Catalhoyuk archaeological site. From that moment on, my correspondence was with the agent Mr Gokhan Kalender. Mr Kalender was in regular contact as our stay in Konya and the tour loomed. He always emailed or telephoned before taking any payment off my credit card and always made sure i knew what I was paying for. This great service was followed up at the end of the tour as he made sure all was satisfactory. But it did not stop there. On the day of our tour we were collected from our hotel by the guide Mustafa. Mustafa was an absolute delight. He was so generous with his knowledge and so warm. He told us many stories about Turkish history and culture, and also shared stories about his own family. My husband and I were sad to say goodbye to him. The Catalhoyuk site was amazing and I can not fault this experience."

A group of 35 landed Istanbul Turkey where a extremely courteous and beautiful personality welcomed us on the Airport and that was Ms. Nurgul Uzan- Our Group Guide from M/s Travel shop Turkey. Since then we didn't know that the time would fly and the six days we spend their would be a unforgettable and pleasant memory for the rest of our life. Trust me this Company is so dependable and reliable that we did not have to spend a penny during our visit as all the bookings which ever they are pertaining to Tourist attractions, Meals , entertainments, Cruises etc all were superbly managed by them. Bottom line If one has to visit Turkey then Travel Shop Turkey is the best choice and without Ms. Nurgul Uzan don't even think of going there.......Hats off to her and Travel Shop Turkey....Love you Guys..Warm Regards,M.

I recently travelled to Turkey with my family, all our tours, hotel bookings and transfers were booked with travel shop and I must commend them on their excellent service and prompt response. We had forgotten one of our shopping bags in a tour bus after a long day of touring in Kusadasi and had completely forgotten about it. The next morning we received a call from the hotel reception informing us that there was someone waiting for us in the lobby, it was the driver from travel shop who had returned our bag with a smile on his face, the staff are all so considerate and helpful. I have to make particular mention of Mr Riza O who assisted us greatly when my sister required urgent medical assistance. The staff were so kind and generous towards us, I cannot thank them enough! Anyone looking to visit Turkey should definitely call Riza O at 0549 540 54 09 for the most unforgettable experience in one of the most beautiful places in this world."

They provided us with a cellular phone to keep in contact with us all the time. I would suggest that Hotel Derici was the worst hotel we stayed in at Kusadasi, kindly use an alternative it was dirty and we developed sinusitis which nearly caused us not to enjoy the rest of our holiday. People working in Ataturk airport are the least hospitable, rude and not very helpful at all.Nurgul from travel shop even though our first meeting was not good we definitely had a good time with you & continue to be a good Turkish Ambassador, Nissam at Kusadasi was awesome and Farouk we love you & Carini the Brazillian girl!!!!!!!"

            "review": "Wonderful staff; Overall, great tour company. My sister and I booked the \"Taste of Turkey\" 12 day tour through a local travel agent in Arizona. Straight away I had a good feeling about this tour; when Mr. Sadik met us at the airport upon our arrival, he handed us a bag with our itinerary, some local information and a company mobile phone with staff numbers taped to the back. We ended up needing this phone a lot, and we were very grateful to have it. Our driver from the airport to our hotel was Mr. Salih (he was by far the best driver we had during our 2 weeks), and though he didn't speak much English, he was very friendly and warm. He even taught us a little Turkish that came in very handy during our tour! Istanbul is a terrific city and our tour guide Ms. Nurgul was very knowledgeable, friendly and handled any special requests that were made.We flew to Ankara that second day, and had another smooth transfer from airport to hotel. We were picked up promptly the next morning by our guide for the rest of the trip, Mr. Hafiz. As a tour guide, he is probably one of the most knowledgeable I've ever come across. Listening to him was more informational than watching a documentary. Some other passengers on our tour double-checked his facts and dates and said that he was spot on. We visited the gorgeous countryside of central Turkey; Pamukkale, Cappadocia, Kusadasi, Troy, Ephesus... The list goes on. In my opinion, the region of Cappadocia and the ancient cities of Hieropolis & Ephesus were by far and away the best parts of the tour. To make a long story short; the itinerary is excellent, the staff is friendly and helpful, and Turkey is an absolutely wonderful country."

My family of 4 (2 adults, 2 kids of 6 and 8 years old) just finished a 10-day private tour with Travel Shop Turkey to Istanbul, Ephesus, Pamukkale, Cappadocia. It was a very good experience.I spent quite a lot of time skyping with their boss, Murtaza, to plan for this trip, and that was one of the reasons why the trip was so successful.The tour guide Ozan was very responsible and knowledgeable. He could explain very well about the attractions, be it religious, nature, history, or others. My kids liked him a lot. My daughter left her backpack with an ipad at a hotel and Ozan immediately called the hotel and found it. Great !The tour itinerary was fabulous. We visited many beautiful places, and I particularly liked Pamukkale and Cappadocia, which are unique in the world. The drivers were on time and always dropped us off at the closest points to the attractions.We paid for 5-star hotels, standard rooms. Out of the 4 hotels we stayed, we were upgraded to the suites in 3 hotels. What a delight !On Day 1 and Day 10, our arrival to Istanbul and departure were very early and very late respectively. This means we had full days in Istanbul. We visited the places of our own choice and they were organized very well.We had a break out to Greece at Kusadasi for 4 days on our own between the tour Day 4 and Day 5 (that means we left the tour after Day 4, then spent 4 days in Greece on our own, and re-joined the tour's Day 5 afterwards). That was well taken care of. Travel Shop Turkey booked the ferry tickets for us, and helped us resolve a lot of logistics.We had some ad-hoc requests from time to time, such as crossing the Bosphorus Strait by car ferry, and dinner at an island we saw on the way. They were well taken care of.If I have to say some negative experience about the tour, that would be (1) during the planning, the responses from their staff were quite slow sometimes, (2) their driver had forgotten 1 piece of our luggage during a car change, (3) Visit to the spice market was planned to be on the last day, and we only knew on that day that it was a holiday and the market was closed. If planning was better, we could have done it on a previous day.After all, it was a great trip. Thanks, Travel Shop Turkey."

There were 3 adults in our group and we booked Travel Shop Turkey to arrange for us a 7 day tour which included Istanbul, Gallipoli, Canakkale, Troy, Kusadasi and Ephesus. Our greatest experience was with your guide in Istanbul \u2013 Nurgul Uzan. Nurgul gave us her attention from 10am to 10pm \u2013 way past her usual finishing time. She made us most welcome and helped us to arrange additional experiences in Istanbul \u2013 and even joined us for a lovely dinner meal at a nice restaurant on the bridge. In particular, Nurgul and my wife formed a very close relationship and there was much laughter between us. She is a credit to your organisation and I can highly recommend her to any touring group looking for a personalised experience in Istanbul. I have attached some photos which obviously demonstrates the friendship that evolved between us during the day. We also had an excellent guide in Gallipoli and Ephesus. The accommodation arranged by Travel Shop Turkey was excellent. I hope we will travel again to Turkey, and use Travel Shop Turkey again to enrich our experience with your wonderful country.RegardsGREG CAMPBELL"

She was by far the best of the 4 guides which we alloted to us by Travelshop Turkey during our holiday . Some of the group members could not understand the accent of Murad who we also had in Istanbul . The 2 others also had a accent which made it hard for them to be understood . But we loved Nurgul as her English is good without an accent so we - all the 12 members of our group could understand her and enjoyed her commentary in all the sighseeing we did with her in Istanbul . She has a vast knowledge about Turkish history and all the landmarks in Istanbul . We found she was also very pleasant and friendly to deal with and she went out of her way to help as whenever she could . Moreover, she patiently explained all the facts in detail over and over again to all of us when we forgot as Turkish history is complicated.If you are going to Istanbul , do ask for tour guide Nurgul Uzan - you will love her as we did and your experience of Istanbul will be awesome!!"

We did a tour around Istanbul, Pamukale, Ephesus and Capadocia and we really enjoyed it! Turkey is a great country, culturally rich, full of wonderful and excellent places. The staff was very friendly and dedicated and especially I want to thanks our Tour Consultant Gokhan Kalender. He did his best for us to feel good every moment and he attended us every time we needed him. Also, he gave us a free telephone with some credit, in case we had any problem we could communicate with them, that was very thoughtful. The hotels were really good, transfers were always on time, tour guides very professionals and everything was under control.I sinceresly recommend to you Turkey as a vacations destiny and TravelShopTurkey to organize a wonderful trip.Thank you very much to everybody and I hope to see you again very soon! :)"

I had booking to reach Turkey on 8 July, 2013 and was worried with news of disturbance in Istanbul. I even thought of cancelling my tickets. But during my stay I felt completely safe and easy. Istanbul is tourist friendly and a great tourist destination, culturally so rich. I would definitely recommend visit to Istanbul.I had a timely pick-up from the airport and drop to my hotel. As I had only a two days trip, Travel shop Turkey tour saved me time. The guide already had tickets (bought in advance), that save me long Q for museum entrance. The only downside for me was limited option of vegetarian food available. Despite explaining that I was a vegetarian, it was hard for my hotel to get it! Still it was manageable, but I am sure this can be improved. Overall an excellent experience, I like to re-visit Istanbul."

The trip was truly facilitated by Travel Shop Turkey and their representative Nurgul Uzan. It was pretty quick how the whole group became friendly with Nurgul who was our guide throughout our Istanbul trip of seven days. We were assisted by Nurgul wherever we had a language problem. I kept asking her random questions about Turkey and Istanbul from time to time during our tour and she always answered and assisted happily. One of the best experiences was walking about 6 or 7 kilometres to reach Taksim Square and witness a peaceful but emotionally charged protest. All the best to Travel Shop Turkey with more visitors!"

Before we went, we were a bit unsettled by the ongoing protests in Istanbul and Izmir. It turned out there was nothing to worry about as everything was normal. Thanks to TravelShop for arranging everything. They even gave us a cellphone for the duration of the trip to stay connected, which was very nice. We were in Istanbul for two days seeing the area near Blue Mosque, St. Sophia, Grand Bazzar and walking the city streets freely at night. We also took the Bosphorous cruise both during the day and in the evening. Hotel Venera that we stayed at was very clean and quiet and conveniently located in the old city. Two days at Istanbul is simply not enough, but we had other places in Turkey and Greece to visit on this trip so that was all the time we had. Definitely will come back in the future."

Making sure that everything was on schedule and that all of our expectations were made. Well it was! We had such a marvelous time there. Istanbul was a great place for so many things.

We were fortunate enough to already know one of the members of this tour company, Hakan Baykara, before we arrived due a trip to Pamukkale with him a few years previous. Even though he was unable to attend the tour with us himself, he made sure that all the arrangments were made so we did not experience any hassle or bother which was delightful, especially whilst being in unfamiliar surroundings. We stayed in the city for 5 days and the two trips which we completed with this tour company (The Bosphorous Cruise and The City Tour) were the parts which stood above the rest. However, I would have to say that our city tour was the ultimate highlight. Before our arrival I was highly excited about the wonders which Istanbul held and Murat Kazmaci, our guide, made the experience one to indefinitely remember. We visited all of the major sites (The Blue Mosque, Aya Sofya, Topkapi Palace, The Grand Bazaar) which were simply breathtaking. Murat was an amazing tour guide throughout the entirety of the day as he not only held great knowledge of each and every aspect of the city, but also with his bubbly personality the day was made even more enjoyable. Furthermore, he was patient with every member of the trip and allowed sufficient time for looking round photographs - he wanted many group photos which allowed the members of the group to really get along, creating a friendly atmosphere throughout the day. All in all, Istanbul is a truly breathtaking city and I will be returning there, hopefully, very soon! The culture, the amazing wonders, the cusine and the people are all elements to be appreciated. Hoewever, without Travel Shop Turkey and our amazing tour guide I doubt that our holiday would have been the same. Thank you guys! I highly recommend this tour company!"

I had unfortunately lost my passport on the second day of my trip and was very concerned, as expected. However, Nurhan was able to send a member of her team with me as we walked around for four hours to each site I had visited, while the travel shop employee tried his best to find out if my passport had shown up somewhere. She was able to adjust my trip itinerary accordingly and advised me on the best way to mitigate the situation. Another example of her consideration is when I missed my connection to Izmer - she was available, at midnight, to set up a hotel room for me and once again, adjust my itinerary due to the unforeseen circumstance. That said, the tour guides and tour locations where amazing. Great service, knowledgeable and friendly staff, and overall a wonderful first trip to beautiful Turkey. Will definitely be back again and will work with Travel Shop for all my needs. Thanks Nurhan."

Being an Agent myself, I know how difficult it is to make passengers happy always, but with the time I had of 5 days in Istanbul and Cappadocia, this was the best experience for me to be managed by \"Travel Shop Turkey\". Specially all arrangements before we reached were nicely handled by Ms. Leyla Tangit. I was earlier to Istanbul many times, and with the Tour guides such as Mr. Burhan Doru and Ms. Nurgul Uzan, it was much more informational experience for me. Though I was never earlier to Cappadocia, was a bit reluctant about the place and facilities, but when we reached and met our tour guide Mr. Murat Kazmaci, I was feeling as comfortable as at home, he is absolutely friendly and had a lot of information to share with us and very comfortable to be with, friendly and polite behavior and experience of handling passengers is excellent. Suggestions for free time to spend and new places to see, he guided us well and made our experience a worth for travel.Overall experience of visiting places in Istanbul and Cappadocia was excellent and nicely managed by Company and its Employees, Guides were best, very informative and friendly. I would say this was one of the best experience for me."

We had tried to organize tours through another agency and it was just not working, finally when they asked for Bank information I looked on Trip Advisor and found Travel Shop Turkey. I sent an email asking for information and was almost instantly in contact with Mr Omur Celik. I told him what we wanted and within a very short time he sent me an email with an itinerary for the two days I asked for. Very impressed. Our first day we were met at our hotel for city tour. I can't remember the guides name but he was very knowledgeable and we saw the Hagia Sophia, the Topkapi Palace, Blue Mosque and shopped and learned along our way to the Grand Bazzar where our tour ended. Day two we were met by Murat Kazmaci for our tour of the Dolmabahce Palace. Murat is very lively, lots of information and stories and loves to share the history of Istanbul and Turkey as a whole. He has a great way of telling the stories and had us laughing many many times. He taught us how to use the public transport, took us to a great place to eat near the Spice Bazzar and stayed with us through shopping in the Spice Bazzar, then suggested a great place to have tea or coffee and a view of the Galata Tower. Very, very enjoyable two days booked with Travel Shop Turkey. I would highly reccommend this group to plan any tour."

Not knowing the ropes, we procrastinated about setting up the excursions that the cruise line offered and by the time we did, the good ones to Pergamum and Ephesus were full! We were crushed!I got online to try to find excursions that might be available those days through another cruise line or someone and discovered \" travelshopturkey.com \". What a remarkable turn of events! Not only were we able to book a tour through them to Pergamum for about what the cruise line was charging but we had our own personal minivan, guide, and separate driver! I ended up canceling the excursions we had set up with the cruise line to other sites and easily found local individual tours for each stop. What a blessing!We also had our tour booked to Pergamum for Nov. 2nd but then our ship delayed departing because of people trying to get out of New York because of Hurricane Sandy. Again I panicked but when I contacted travelshopturkey they said it would be no problem and they'd meet us on the 3rd. We found our guide waiting on us with a sign with our name on it as we disembarked.Our guide was named Nizamettin Adsiz. He spoke fluent English and was very knowable and enthusiastic. We learned so much about not only the ruins at Pergamum but also what life is like in Turkey now. It's just neat to be able to ask question after question without thinking you are taking up the guide's time or interrupting anyone else. We also ate lunch with him and the driver and we were able to learn some things about the driver's life even though he spoke no English.We felt pretty smug going around the big tour groups from our cruise ship! lolWhat a wonderful experience!Pergamum is a \"must see\" and I'd highly recommend it through travelshopturkey.comDugald & Nancy McMillanWoodland, Al USA"

Ilker was simply awesome. Istanbul has so much to offer tourist and we would have liked to stay a day or two more.We then flew to our next stop, Kusadasi, which was just as awesome as Istanbul, Nizam our tour guide also proved just as capable and knowledgeable. The trip to the Ephesus was eye opening, with amazing discoveries, lunch was great and all the travel arrangements work like clockwork. The disappoint part of this leg of our trip was the accommodation, Hotel Dirasi, just did not cut it, it is rated as a four star hotel, but it\u2019s more like a two star, would not advise anyone to stay there. We soon forgot about the hotel and moved on to our next stop over, Coppadoaccia, again everything was on time, we had two incredible tour guides Kubra and Kisma, both well spoken, very well versed on the attractions and very helpful. They all just made the trip worth it. Our main coach driver, Mustafa was friendly and helpful. His coach was very clean and neat. A final thanks to the senior manager at the Travel Shop, Mr Adnan, he kept in contact on a daily basis and made sure we got our monies worth. The Travel Shop were great. Thanks to all."

The itenerary was as following:Day 1- Pick up from airport, drop off to hotel, check in and enjoy the day. This was setup very well. I was looking for the individual for about 15 minutes at the airport and he took me to the van and from their to the hotel for the quick check in. Sadaq was the Tour operator and Saleh was the driver. Both did an exceptional job of making it a smooth journeyDay 2-Was picked up at the stated time (8:45am) and from their was taken to the other tour sites. Luckily it was just me and another individual. We did all the tour sites except for 1 which I mentioned to Travel shop and the were able to accomodate it the following day. Our tour guide was Murrat for that day. He was a good tour guide. He provided a high level summary of the tour sites and their historical siginficance. I would suggest that if you want detailed information (dates, purpose, uniqueness, then do the research and then ask the questions). I would imagine different tour guides provide different historical input. Day ended at 4pm and was dropped off to my hotel.Day 3- It was luckily just me today on the tour and it was terrific.- picked up at 8:45am. We visited all the sites, including the one missed yesterday, and were able to fit in a chai break over the Golden Horn and then lunch on the Asian side over looking the Bosphurus to Istanbul (European side). Day ended around 5. Saleh and Murrat were very hospitable and kind during the whole trip. Murrat was able to give an evening itenerary by Tram and it worked out perfect! Murrat did a great job today! Tell him Merhaba from me :)Day 4- We started the day at 6am. Ayub was the operator for today. He kindly picked me up and took me to the Ferry near Kabatas and had me checked in for a 2 hour trip to Bursa. Arrived their at 9 to be picked up by local operator. He took us to another location to be picked up by the central operator and then we went and picked up others. The day was great. The unfortunate aspect was that it was the wrong tour guide for me that day but luckily I was able to see the Uludagh mountains which made up for a lot. Though I was not the in right tour guide, it was partially my fault as they announced the day's itenerary before starting and I did not say anything as I thought it may have been slight modification/mis interperations. Nonetheless, when I noticed by 3pm we were not on the intenarary, I told the tour guide Furize and she setup a pick up to take me to atleast the Ulucami Masjid (I was able to catch my prayers their as well). So net net it went well. Dropped of and checked in to Ferry by the local operator and picked up by Ayub in Istanbul. Dropped to hotel by 8ish.Day 5- Today was a solo day. Thecheck out was by 12 at the hotel: Princess Old City Hotel, which by the way was terrific as well. The service, the food, rooms and the cleanliness. Was picked up by the tour operator at 1:30 to be dropped off at the airport :(So as you can see, though things were not 100% in line, as soon as I brought it to the Tour guide's attention they did whatever they could to resolve it. I definetly will be using their services again and now knowing how things work, I will be able to ask proper questiosn as well. I.e, when I arrive at the airport, who should I call? On the day's iternary, ensure you are in the correct tour trip. I do have to say that the tour guides could have been more informative, but then again you should find out before hand if it is a detailed inforamtion tour guide as everyone may not want that. Great exerpience, smooth check-in's /outs, great accomodation, very kind/hospitable/polite. Great great great!!!Look forward to visiting Turkey again.Thanks Travel Shop.Muddassir"

As we arrived very late in the evening we had to drop our luggage quickly and go out to find somewhere to eat dinner without anybody to guide us. We had to accept a three star hotel for the first three nights but it should have been a four star. By eight in the morning we had to be ready to leave for the tour and this was too early for the first day after arrival. We were tired, had no time to eat breakfast, and were told we would be left behind if we took time to eat then. The bus did not make any refreshment stops, so lunch was not offered until two thirty, which was when we arrived at Bursa, two hundred and twenty kilometres from Istanbul! After all of this we did actually enjoy very much the sea crossing to Bursa and the guided tour we were given there. We took a tour on the cable car, visited the museum, the old market places and some facinating historical sites. The tours over the next few days were also very enjoyable. We went all around Istabul, explored the Asian and European areas, Aya Sophia Mosque, Sultan Ahmed, Suleymaniye, Abiu Ayu Al Ansari, the beautiful Grand Bazaar, the Egyptian Bazaar (or Spicy Bazaar) and so much more than I can say here. Many thanks to Mr Ozcan Aytac and Sadaq for the help they gave us each time we called them using the mobile phones they supplied to us on our arrival. Thanks also to the helpful driver from Travel Shop. We were easily able to extend our stay through the Travel Shop Agent. Despite the difficulties I would recommend this Travel Shop Service to my friends. The service could easily be improved with better management and some training in communication with foreigners. They also could improve their awareness of the needs of visually impaired people."

Our Hotel was changed on the second leg of the tour without notification to us or our travel agent. The cell phone provided for us to contact them did not work and they did nothing to rectify it even though it was advised on Day 1. Lunch 'provided' on one of the tours offered NO choice, take the pie or that is it. Trip to Ankara was a disaster, wrong ticket provided to us and we had to sort it out. When we arived in Ankara at midnight no one was there to receive us. Overall I would not use this company again nor would I recommend them."

We had an excellent time and the staff of TravelShop Turkey and our tour guides were informative and helpful, although sometimes a bit too quick on their feet to keep up with in the Istanbul crowds. Our 3 days in Cappadocia were especially wonderful, with accommodation in a fantastic luxury cave hotel, 2 full day tours, lovely guides and delicious lunches in local restaurants. Our 2 day tours in Istanbul were also fascinating, but slightly marred by the rather bizarre fact that half the people on the bus had one itinerary and the other half had a slightly different itinerary. Both groups had to fork out an extra 25 Lira per person to be allowed to visit all the sites on the agenda for the day, otherwise they'd have to wait while the other group visited the Hagia Sophia or the Topkapi Palace, both of which are among the top attractions of Istanbul. It seemed like some kind of 'divide and conquer' strategy to get us to fork out extra cash - and it worked, but left a lingering bad taste in our mouths... We've never encountered such a weird tour situation anywhere else in the world.Apart from that, we did really enjoy Istanbul and we did appreciate the friendly and helpful attitude of both our driver and knowledgable guide and the very efficient organisation of transfers, flights and accommodation."

The whole tour was very well organised and we never had to worry about anything - we were always met on time and the hotels were fantastic. The tour company provided us with a mobile phone for the duration of the tour which was a very good touch as they were able to contact us when we left Istanbul and check to see that we were having a good time. All of the tour guides we had during the week were exceptional - very knowledgable and spoke perfect English. We were very pleased that the guides all recommended local restaurants for us for lunch which had a personal feel and not the huge buffet style restaurants frequented by the coach tours. I would definitely recommend the tour company to anyone visiting Turkey.If you are visitng Capadoccia during your trip I would recommend requesting Sanem if you want an English speaking guide - she was fantastic and so friendly."

I will evaluate Travel Shop Turkey in general, since I had a private guided tour with them, where I visited Istanbul, Pamukkale, Antalya, & Cappadocia. My experience can be summarized with the following:A team of efficient and straight to the point people, who respond and act on a timely manner, to realize your dream tour at the highest standard of service quality and at the lowest rate at the market. They were always on time, specially when they first meet me. They handed me over a mobile phone with a charger through which we communicated with them, and with every where.During my long trip (18 days) I have been really impressed with the level of commitment they have shown. The driver was really helpful and polite, and the guide had a huge knowledge about the history of Turkey. She treated us so nicely, she even surprised us with a gift and small village Birthday Party for my Daughter who turned 6 Years old in Turkey. I simply recommend them to anybody who is planning to visit Turkey and wish to have a private guided tour. Note: I would recommend travelers to select their Restaurants & Shopping places alone, since guides are known to the shoppers, who would charge high prices once they know you are a tourist."

The problem was that I only had 2 days left in Istanbul so I had to cram a trip to Cappadocia within 2 days. I contacted several travel agencies that day. Despite such short notice, Travel Shop Turkey provided exceptional service with the best price and the best customized itinerary within a few hours. Because my schedule was so restrictive, I had to have a customized itinerary to accommodate all the activities and tours I wanted to do in Cappadocia. Travel Shop Turkey was the only travel agency I found that could deliver this for me! I had a very packed, rigorous schedule which included 2 flights, a regular packaged tour, an extra private tour to the underground city, stay at a cave hotel, and hot air balloon ride. I was very impressed with how smoothly everything went for me despite such last minute preparations. Ozcan, my travel consultant, arranged everything within 12 hours--what excellent service! I could enjoy a hassle-free, stress-free visit to Cappadocia because he had taken care of everything. I worried that after my hot air balloon ride, I would not make it to the airport on time for my international flight because there is no way to tell where you will land after a hot air balloon ride, BUT after I landed a car was there ready to whisk me away to the airport! During my brief sojourn in Cappadocia, Ozcan also called a few times to check up on me and my family to make sure we were enjoying our trip and to allow me to voice any concerns or difficulties. I appreciated this gesture to make sure that we were well and happy--this is also an indication of how much they value their customer's satisfaction. I thoroughly enjoyed this trip, which has contribute to my fond memories of Turkey.I highly recommend Travel Shop Turkey and am confident that they will provide services that would satisfy your needs!"

Our direct wedding planner (Annette ) was absolutely amazing. She was so energetic and so awesome that we couldn't ask for a better person. She was active and made sure we like every little piece of their design. Our guests were massively impressed and later told us that they had never seen a wedding like this. everything was exciting. At some point I think my sister went towards our wedding planner and gave her a huge hug for all of the creativity and excitement :) we had volcanos, belly dancing, classical music, opera singer, japanese balloons, DJ and so many other exciting phases.

My husband and I booked a 9-day holiday using Travel Shop Turkey, and it included round trip transfers between Istanbul, Cappadocia, and Izmir (Kusadesi), as well as hotels with breakfasts in all three locations and guided tours for 7 of those days. Our initial airport pick-up was a little late but luckily our Tour Consultant Defne, was always a phone call away and was able to resolve the issue fairly quickly. After that, everything went fairly smoothly. We had guided tours of Istanbul, Cappadocia and Kusadesi. We asked for 5 star hotels in all three cities and were given better hotels than we expected in Kusadesi, (The Charisma Deluxe Hotel) and Cappadocia - (The MDC Hotel) but our hotel in Istanbul was slightly below par (The Central Palace Hotel). Our biggest complaint with that hotel was that we were given a very small room with 2 single beds, non-English speaking staff, and the hotel didn't provide irons for guests, instead they charged a lot of money for ironing services, and returned your clothes a few hours later smelling like smoke. Our tour guides in all three cities were very knowledgable but there were 2 guides who didn't speak English very well and we had a difficult time understanding what they were saying. Travel Shop Turkey was very prompt and reliable when it came to arranging the very comfortable and private transportation, and they also gave us some free meals which we found out during the course of the trip. Their staff was very friendly, nice and and reliable and we would definitely plan a holiday with them again."

The islands themselves were quite nice - very laid back, restful, and attractive scenery. The tour itself was another story. Our guide, Hakan, picked us up at the hotel at the proscribed time, and escorted us to the boat terminal. Once we got there, however, it turned out that the boat schedule had changed and we had a 1.5 hour wait until the next boat would depart. The guide basically told us we were \"free to hang out\" while we waited, and went off to talk on his phone for a while. My wife and I were stuck twiddling our thumbs while we waited -- Hakan apparently hadn't checked the boat times before picking us up, and didn't attempt to find something else to help fill the time (there's got to be stuff around nearby we could have taken a walk or drive to look at while we waited). Once the boat did arrive and we boarded, the ride out to the islands took about 90 minutes, I think. The trip went fine, and Hakan talked with us some about the history of the islands, the buildings on the shoreline, etc. But, he also spent a lot of time checking his messages and in general looking bored. When we finally reached the islands, he booked us on a horse carriage ride, and said he'd meet us at the boat terminal when it was time to head back to the mainland. The horse carriage ride was nice, but having a guide along to answer questions about what we were seeing would have been nice. It seemed odd that we were spending so much time away from the guide we were paying to guide us.My wife and I had lunch when we returned from the ride, and then spent some time shopping and looking around the island. We happened to run into our guide near the boat terminal again and he invited us over to have some tea; we sat and talked with him for about an hour while we waited for the boat. He then helped us get back to the mainland, and then escorted us back to the hotel. The ride back went a bit better - Hakan seemed more engaged with us and we had a nice conversation for the ride back.I was happy that we decided to see the Princes' Islands, and enjoyed that part of the day. The \"tour\" however, felt more like someone helping us more with the transportation details than actually taking time to introduce us to the cultural history for the sites we were seeing. It's possible this was supposed to be a larger group tour, and it turned out we were the only ones attending for the day? Not the best tour we took in Istanbul, but also not the worst."

We were taken to all the places that was listed on the artinery and more. The hotels that was organised were breath taking and no expense was spared by the tour operator. The tour guide Hakan was a delight whom exeeded our expectations.

The bus driver Nail .also took pride in making sure his passengers safety was always his first prority. He was very friendly and curtious at all times. He kept the bus in tip top condition and very clean at all times. He had a can do attitude which made our travel even more fun.the only complaint i have is the trip finishing after 15 days. I wish i had more time to travel around with these professional people. I was that impressed with travel shops staff, i had to go personaly to their office in Istanbul to meet them all in person. I was pleased to meet all the staff and to thank them all in person for organising such a great trip for us. I met the owner murtaza kalender and notified him of my happiness with his team. I was suprised that his team was made up of young and keen people whom care for their guests.Thank you Travelshop turkey and Murtaza well done.Looking foward to seeing you all again soon."

He took us for a tour of a mosque by architect Sinan in Uskudar and then a tour of the market there. He showed us many of the local specialties and was able to enlighten us on foods and products that we were not familiar with. He provided us with a unique experience of a \"dolmash\" ride to Kadikoy to visit the market there and have a most wonderful lunch at Ciya restaurant. He pointed out the best shops for coffee and Turkish delight! Then we strolled the neighborhood among the locals away from the tourist vibe. It was like visiting the city with a new friend."

We also seemed to have missed some parts but she did not say why, so later, we were left wondering why some areas mentioned in the guide books were not covered. We could tell she was getting tired mid afternoon and was hurrying us through some of the last places. On our second day we had Serif himself and he was much better. We started the day with a brief history of Istanbul so we could understand the city's metamorphosis over the centuries. He was very sensitive to our needs and gave us an insider's tour and told us what we wanted to know and not just the standard tourist information we could read for ourselves. We had a very unique walk through the spice market, a traditional Han, old craft shops, the roof of the Grand Bazaar; and had an initiation into Turkish street food. This proved very useful for the rest of our stay in Turkey. Although the food experience was good, I think the extra charge of US$40 per person for food was too high for small snacks bought off street vendors."

He was amazingly generous with his time in helping us plan things well outside his role: hotels, airport transfers, recommendations on food. We met him for a two-day gig at our hotel. Our immediate impression was that Serif was a cut above your typical (and generally acceptable) tour guide; he is a true polymath, which became apparent in our conversation at the hotel before we headed out. He asked some questions of us to help him understand what our interests where, and like a talented musician changing key to blend with the orchestra, his comments and suggestions melded with our interests. He's a sharp, sharp guy who can take disparate data points, facts, figures and dates and weave them into a narrative that made the day fly by far too quickly. On Day 2, we worked with an associate of Serif's - which he told us would be he case when we booked. While no Serif, our day-2 guy was also a cut above, with a near-encyclopedic knowledge of the city and it's history. Also a great guy, it was apparent that Serif has set a programming methodology with his associates, training them to give the same high-touch, custom experience that we had on Day 1. As a veteran of dozens of these sorts of tours, I would put Serif and his organization in the top 1 percent of all our tour experiences. Add his willingness to help with things outside his purview, I (in the words of Rick James) wish I had more hands, so I could give him more thumbs-up."

We took a walking tour with a group of 20 people, specifically to conquer the Grand Bazaar but also the near by surroundings. I say \" conquer \" because it is really a big bazaar just to wander in and find the best shops on your own considering 4400 shops within. We were scheduled to gather at 10 AM in \"Corlulu Ali Pasa Medresesi\" so we did and had cup of tea, coffee, some of us tried the hookah/nargile and we had an short introduction session to know each other better. Mr. Serif handed us a copy of the Grand Bazaar plan which belongs to his own publications. Please be advised that he wrote the first guidebook of Turkey ever written by a Turk. This may give you an idea about how knowledgeable he is not only about Istanbul but all regions of the country.We first climbed on the bazaar's roof which is not always possible and requires pre-authorization. The scene was amazing, this is also where they shot the James Bond's Sky Fall scenes. He told us the story of the bazaar, the reason why it was built at the first place and how it served people and camel trains back then.He took us to several shops, for example, to a rug and fabric store, cashmere scarves store, jewellery store, to the man called \" Gramophone Father \" who loved gramophones and fixes them and watches for living, to handicrafts-men's shops and they were all so welcoming not only because they have sincere relationships with Mr. Serif but because that was the way they were. They all told us about their crafts and family stories.We had lunch at one of the local restaurants within the bazaar, Bahar Restaurant, food was delicious. Prices are okay. Then we went to \" Buyuk Valide Han \" where every one takes great photos especially by hopping on the dome of the inn and keeping the beautiful Istanbul view behind. So we also did :) Then we went to couple more inns and he informed us about the history of them all as well.I do not want to give you all details and sabotage the joy you will have but what I can say is that, at least 1 tour in a life time with Serif Yenen is a must. I thank him again very very much !"

He contacted me via email prior to our visit and asked what we would like to see in Istanbul - I said we wanted to see it all. Well Elvan, our guide, tried her hardest to get all the top sights in while not rushing us through anything. We saw amazing sites, tried some great street food and kept her busy answering all our questions about life in Turkey. We thoroughly enjoyed our time with her and would not hesitate to recommend this company, and especially our guide, to anyone travelling to Turkey."

Serif was very fast and professional organizing the agreements and the guide he chose was very nice and competent. Seljuk brought us around in a very fast yet relaxing pace. It was the best solution to visit the most important locations without cues or worries, and exploring less popular corners of the city. We were just the 3 of us and everything was very friendly. We talked a lot, about Turkey and about Italy. We ate delicious food and also spent time in some book stores to check music and films. These were really enjoyable moments.Markus & Saverio"

He started the tour by asking us what we wanted to see, and then customized our day to accomplish it all. He was so knowledgable about the city and it's history and the Turkish people. I would compare him to the best history professor one could have. He even took us shopping in the Grand Bazaar and pointed us to reputable stores.We also went to Ephesus, where Serif provided our guide, Meltem.

She was great at guiding us through the city on foot, taxis, trains, boats, to get efficiently from place to place. She spoke english extremely well, and did great with translations in the bazaars for shopping. Apparently tour guides get to skip many of the lines with their clients in Istanbul which sped things along (and we were informed prior that they do not have this privilege at the Blue Mosque so we did that on our own another day to save time on the day we had Nursal with us ). Serif was also great to deal with by email to advise us on what to see and timing for different decision. The whole experience went very smoothly. We then went on a cruise through Greece, Malta, several stops in Italy including Rome on several cruise tours, but by far the best tour was with Nursal in Istanbul. Ken H"

The van he used was perfect for getting me close to things without having to do much walking (I am mobility-challenged) and he assisted me with navigating the cobblestone streets with a walker. He concentrated on our interests--history and Iznik tiles--and told us in depth about the Byzantines, Islam and Turkish culture and cuisine. We visited Topkapi palace, Hagia Sofia, Suliemaniye mosque, Sultanahmet mosque, Rustem Pasha mosque, the Basilca Cistern, the Hippodrome, the Grand Bazaar, the Spice Market, took a food tour (on both the European and Asian sides) and saw how carpets and tiles were made. His associates gave us excellent tours of the Turkish and Islamic Arts museum and a cruise on the Bosphorus, as well as a day at Ephesus. Serif gave us very useful materials that he has developed on most of the sites we visited (and don't miss his video, \"Istanbul Unveiled\" for a different view of the city. Over more than 25 years of guiding tours, he has developed a smooth style of presenting history in a very accessible manner in excellent English. The associates he arranged for us were knowledgeable, flexible and spoke outstanding English. The bus driver was very helpful and arranged to pick us up close to the sites without lots of walking. We would recommend Serif and his group to anyone wanting to have a magical experience in Istanbul. He became a close friend in just a few days. You will enjoy his open personality and friendliness."

We had previously toured the main attractions in Sultanhamet with Serif and wanted to see more of Istanbul. Serif had planned a wonderful day for us. We first drove to Asia via the Bosphorus Bridge. Morning tea was enjoyed by a gleaming marina in Kalamis. We then drove through the very upscale Baghdad Street. This is well described as the Beverly Hills of Istanbul. We had visited Kadikoy previously so we were taken to Uskudar Food Market to browse and have a delicious Turkish lunch. For main course we had the famous Iskerder Kebap followed by a Kunefe dessert. As well as the shopping and sampling of food, this area includes the Mirimah Sultan mosque built in the 16th century. There is a ferry pier and great views across the Bosphorus.We noted there were very few tourists there and we enjoyed observing the local people relaxing at a favourite place.We drove along the Bosphorus on the Asian side, crossing back to Europe via the Fatih Bridge. We then drove along the European side of the Bosphorus.Our final destination was Ortakoy where we had a tea break. The Ortakoy Mosque is magnificent and the area was full of other historic buildings, shops and the excellent ambiance of its' waterfront location.Again, there seemed to be relatively few tourists which of course is in contrast to the Sultanhamet tourist area. In summary, we had a marvellous day with Serif. All day he pointed out interesting sights and further enriched our knowledge of the history and people of Turkey. Naturally, we got to eat delicious food with him. Serif is always very good company and is truly a friend to us. I am looking forward to planning a multi day tour with him for when I can next return to Turkey.I highly recommend Serif for both day tours in Istanbul or longer tours through Turkey."

Serif placed them in the sweep of the Ottoman Empire's history. But each visit was interspersed with visits to the bazaar or the huge markets or a favourite cafe or restaurant. Serif was as knowledgeable about the vast array of spices or fish in the markets as he was about the culture of Turkey.The only element of melancholy arose from the bombing inAnkara whilst we were there and his concern about the turmoil in the country."

Most importantly, Serif was straightforward in advising against the use of a car & driver (something I was being royally charged for by the other tour operator) for the simple reason that cars can't get too close to any of the specific attractions we would be visiting (e.g. Blue Mosque, Hagya Sophia, Topkapi Palace, Cisterns, etc. -- just to be clear, ours was not a 'foodies tour'). While this sort of recommendation is unusual (i.e. it essentially meant we would be paying less money for Serif's services) it made perfect sense once we actually went to those places. A car & driver would have been such a waste! Besides, our guide (Esra) made the logistics of using public transportation a breeze. Bottom line: we're grateful to Serif for delivering great services on short notice, making an honest recommendation that saved us money and \u2013 last but not least \u2013 pairing us up with an excellent tour guide, who actually made our day in Istanbul truly enjoyable and memorable. Highly recommended!"

My friend and I arrived a day early for a 10 day tour of Turkey after booking on line with Serif for a private 1 day walking food tour of Istanbul. For two women traveling alone it was a very safe way to spend a thoroughly enjoyable day. Serif met us at our hotel and we walked from Europe to Asia discovering the real Istanbul while savouring beautiful food along the way. Serif is very knowledgeable and professional and Provided an insight into the history and culture of Istanbul while we enjoyed a continuous supply of fresh local food. I can't recommend this tour highly enough. Thanks Serif."

Being foodies, this was a planned highlight of our trip even as a pescetarian which was not an issue at all. Serif went out of his way to make our day brilliant since we had to rearrange due to labour day demonstrations and he personally came to meet with us to plan and prepare. We went with Serif\u2019s colleague, Aydin the next day. The whole day was relaxed, personalised to what we wanted and experienced with great knowledge. History, facts and figures are all great but what we enjoyed most was Aydin\u2019s personal real life approach. It felt like we were hanging with an old friend. We sampled lots of savoury foods including borek, pide, muscles and so so so much more. Lots of tea & coffee stop, baklava, amazing hand-made delights which we would never have found, nargile to finish the afternoon. We kept walking and eating sampling anything that caught our eye, meandering through various markets, organic foods shops, areas of upbeat and trendy Istanbul (karikoy) which we were then able to revisit the next day and buy a truck load of amazing local biscuits we tasted, tram ride over the galata birdge, a ferry ride across to kadikoy was included in the trip so we managed to cover a lot of sightseeing at the same time. There was no time pressure and we ended our day at the friends meeting caf\u00e9 in Cihangir (another trendy part of town) with Serif and Aydin recapping the day. The local way was the best way to experience this diverse city. The locals we met on our tour were great and always happy to share and sample food \u2013 key to the Turkish way of life. We went to a recommended Hamman the next day and were very impressed. I highly recommend Serif and his colleagues for the most personalised tour you could ask for."

Our guide \"Mrs Esra\" met us at out hotel in the heart of old Istanbul at 9.00 am.One of the biggest advantages of having an \"official guide\" was that Esra was able to \"jump the queue\" at every attraction, saving much wasted time. Another advantage was that for a little more than the cost of joining a \"small group tour\" we, as a couple, had a dedicated guide who went at our speed, without waiting for the slowest person and inconvenience of a group.All the main historical attractions in the old city are within an easy walk of 2 km / 30 minute radius. In the morning we visited the attractive surroundings of the Topkapi Palace with stunning views over the city and Bosphorus. Then the Hagia Sophia mosque. Unfortunately this grand and splendid mosque was spoilt inside by one half being filled with scaffolding.A short walk took us through the Hippodrome, a wide open boulevard with little to show of it's history other than an Egyptian obelisk.We were then lead to see how the finest carpets were made. An interesting demonstration by a very skilled weaver but we then had to endure a 40 minute sales pitch. It was nearly an hour before we came out although they did provide refreshment. In the afternoon we visited the Cistern Basilica. A beautiful columnated underground reservoir originally built in 650AD to provide water for the palaces. Then a 5 minute walk to the \"blue\" mosque which is stunningly attractive with it's minarets and colourful interior. Our guide then helped us book a traditional Hamman, a Turkish Massage at the oldest and best, the Ayasofya Hurrem Sultan Hamami for the following evening.There are many beautiful parks and gardens, and it seemed each one had a dog asleep in the shade. We didn't see one dog on a leash during our 4 day stay !The cleanliness of the city was remarkable.Finally we caught the tram (10 mins) to the Spice market. Colourful, vibrant and filled with wonderful aromas. With advice on where to buy the best Turkish Delight made with honey, not sugar syrup, we bought a small box before saying goodbye to Esra at about 5.00 pm. Esra was extremely knowledgeable, helpful, friendly and polite and we would strongly recommend her to other travellers."

Two of Serif's characteristics make him a truly standout guide. First, he was incredibly RESPONSIVE to our interests and needs. We had three days to see Istanbul, and had a long list of sites and Jewish interests to explore. Serif helped us put together an on-the-spot itinerary that made the most of our time, and adjusted along the way. He was knowledgeable and personable, and we enjoyed getting to know about his family and Turkish life over lunch almost as much as we did learning about the history of Istanbul. Second, we will never forget his RESOURCEFULNESS. My smartphone stopped working the minute it connected with the Turkish network, and I needed to get it working before leaving on a two-week cruise. Serif helped me scout out one of the few Blackberry specialists in Istanbul to save my data and then took me to where I could replace the phone with something more reliable before we left. On our last day in Istanbul, my wife woke up ill and had to miss touring with Serif and me in the morning. Knowing what was most important to her, Serif turned our itinerary upside down to make sure that she could experience them.

So based on a recommendation of a friend we contacted Serif Yenen. What a difference he made. For two days Serif exposed us to not only Istanbul's top sites but also some out of the way places that we would not have explored on our own. The experience was delightful and educational. We learned so much about the history of Turkey and Istanbul. Serif clearly has in-depth knowledge of the city. And Serif's value goes beyond just talking about the sites. Serif would constantly point out the significance of the art painted on virtually every wall and ceiling of the buildings we visited. But what really made this an outstanding experience was Serif's style - he was easy going and approachable. We never felt like we were on a \"tour\", it was more like a good friend was proudly showing off his city. We have recommended Serif to friends who planned a visit to Istanbul. If we are fortunate enough to visit again we will definitely engage Serif to take us around to experience even more of this wonderful city."

We engaged guides at a few of our other destinations on our voyage, and while we would recommend all of them, none quite measured up to the very high bar set by Serif. I hope you appreciate the incalculable valueAnyone touring with Serif will benefit by his incredible knowledge of history, culture and the arts -- as well as his seemingly effortless sense of the best way to blend activities to provide exposure to such a rich mix. We left after three days feeling like we could not have had a more effective exposure to the wealth that Istanbul represents \u2013 a tall order for a city that offers so much to stimulate the senses! And separate from all the experiences, we also very much enjoyed Serif's company (a bonus!). We have been singing his praises widely, comfortable with the knowledge that we were credible in doing so. Of all the places we visited across the Mediterranean, Turkey is at the top of our list of places to return. While our experience in Istanbul was so fulfilling, it served as only a tease for what the rest of Turkey must contain. We hope we will be fortunate enough to connect with Serif upon our return."

The tour was organized in the honor of a world-renown management scholar, Prof. Nancy J. Adler (McGill University). Nancy is an expert in cultures and cross-cultural interactions. Serif\u2019s full-day tour in the Old City provided us with the most important highlights of the Turkish history, heritage and culture. I don\u2019t think that our long and complex history could be explained in such clarity, wit, and wisdom by anyone other than Serif. Depth and scope of Serif\u2019s knowledge has reflected his expertise and experience of many years. Serif was the expert but with an approachable style. He welcomed questions and comments; responded in the most respectful and friendly manner. I firmly believe that if we had more experts like Serif in Turkey, the distorted image of our beautiful country would improve in the world scene. A heartfelt congratulations and thanks Serif Yenen!"

He met us every morning in our hotel lobby and we set off around Istanbul from there - either in a private air conditioned vehicle (which he provided), by taxi or by foot depending on the agenda that day. Before we had arrived he sent us extensive emails outlining possible itineraries; what he would recommend in one day, what was best for the children, etc. We had to do NO planning whatsoever which really made the experience so relaxing for us. Serif's knowledge of Istanbul and Turkey's history is extraordinary (he writes his own guide books). Every site we visited he was able to provide every detail - there was no flipping through guide books or trying to read pamphlets. He is such a kind and gregarious man even my girls loved spending time with him each day. He made learning about Istanbul and Turkey interesting even for them each day. Another incredible benefit of touring with Serif is that everyone knows him! Every spot we went people happily greeted him. We were whisked to the front of lines and always granted easy access. This was essential when traveling with two small children as waiting in long lines in the heat of the summer is no fun for them. We love to eat and discover the best local food and every day we had the most incredible lunches with him at places he recommended. I truly cannot say enough about our experience with Serif. After spending 4 days with him he truly felt like family to us and we still keep in touch with him one year later. We look forward to returning to Istanbul in a few years and further exploring with our dear friend Serif. Do not hesitate to book with him, you will absolutely love the experience he provides!"

We did a lot of traveling on our tour and he coordinated it in a very efficient way. Despite that he was willing to deviate from the plan if a special opportunity presented itself. He did that a number of times on our trip allowing us some very special interactions with the local people. Not speaking Turkish would have made travel very difficult in the Eastern areas. In the end he had taught us a number of essential phrases and words. I really enjoyed talking to Serif about many things.

We started with the Hippodrome and then Blue Mosque. Sofiye new both sites very well and also gave us a general education on Turkey. I have reviewed these sites separately but will add again that they are magnificent. We then walked to the Topkapi palace to beat the crowds and also do a site that takes more time to see. I had been laid up with illness and was still struggling so Sofiye really paced the tour well for me. The Topkapi is a beautiful place with large grounds and has many artifacts. It is a museum as much as as an architectural visit. We were educated on many of the areas and also given free time to walk around. We then headed to Hagia Sophia, the old Christian church that had been converted to a Mosque. It was under construction but we still saw much of its beauty and history. We then had a traditional Turkish lunch that is not included but was very good and came to only $26 including picking up Sofiye's meal. Sofiye then took me to a pharmacy to get some cold medicine which really helped me get thru the rest of the trip. We ended with the Grand Bazaar which was impressive to see but we were not looking to buy anything.

There is always a concern if you book independent excursions when you are cruising that you might not return to the ship in time for sailing. The Cruise lines know this and prey on people's fears. What they do not realise is that Tour Companies know precisely the timings and have contingency plans in place to get you back in time as you may read from other testimonials. We were met at the pier in this amazing City by the equally amazing and beautiful Seda Cengiz. She is a very passionate and knowledgeable guide and imparted so much information. I should add that this was a group tour but we were the only couple on this trip. Very Good for us; not so good for this Country's tourism. They are suffering and I get very angry at the stupidity of some people who allow themselves to be put off travelling when in fact there are threats everywhere.

We really dislike expensive cruise ship shore excursions that involve being herded around, slowly, with a busload of other passengers. I booked an Istanbul Walking Tour with Tram through Curio Travel. A guide met us at the ship and took us via tram directly to the Hippodrome and Blue Mosque. After the Mosque, we walked to Topkapi Palace, Hagia Sophia, the Cistern, the Grand Bazaar, and the Spice Bazaar. At the end of the day, our guide took us via tram back to the ship. Our guide was professional, pleasant, very informative, and very accommodating. The absolute best day of our 24-day Mediterranean cruise! We highly recommend skipping the cruise ship shore excursions and booking with Curio Travel."

I had arranged two private tours in Kusadasi with Ephesus Shuttle( division of Curio Travel) and the agent Suzan informed me she could arrange a custom tour for my husband and I while we were in port overnight in Istanbul. I wanted to include a tour of the old Jewish quarter as well as a visit to the Ahrida Synagogue and she was able to arrange this for us. Our guide Tyfun was wonderful. It was a crowded chaotic day at the most popular sights and somehow he worked his magic and got us to the front of lines and in and out before big tour groups arrived. We also had the flexibility of adding and making some changes to the original itinerary as we went along. Tyfun took care of every request and stayed with us every step of the way....even through the Grand Bazaar! When we return to Turkey, I will be contacting this agency again."

There was a fair bit of walking, but nothing to strenuous. I would advise flat or walking shoes and not sandels. Take a sunhat, a camera and a bottle of water."

Gulay was incredibly knowledgable and very happy to point out the most interesting points at the different site and even found us a kid friendly place for lunch.

He met us at our hotel and took us immediately to the Blue Mosque so that we got there before the huge line ups. Our day in Istanbul had been cut short by our cruise line but Tayfun easily adapted and made sure that we got to see everything on our wish list including Topkapi Palace and the Grand Bazaar. We appreciated how knowledgeable and passionate he was about his city and the sites he took us to. Tayfun also made sure that we got to our cruise ship on time. Our second tour was from Kusadasi to Ephesus with Deniz. We had booked with Curio Travel because the cruise excursions did not include everything we wanted to see. On this customized tour we got to see the House of the Virgin Mary, the Ephesus ruins, the Terrace Houses, The Basilica of St. John and the Temple of Diana/Artemis. Once again our guide Deniz was very knowledgeable and adaptable to our interests. Both tours were very professional and we thoroughly enjoyed them both. Suzan in the office was fantastic at making all of our arrangements and even advised us that our cruise time had changed before the cruise company did. So glad we booked with Curio. Highly recommend them."

We were a party of six on the 12-day Grand Mediterranean cruise on the Island Princess cruise ship (27 June to 9 Jul 2015), from Barcelona, Spain to Venice, Italy. We used the \u201cTripadvisor\u201d web site to pick the highly-rated tours that suited us best and then we pre-arranged all of our port call excursions via email before we departed on our vacation.We had a great time in Italy and Greece before departing for Istanbul, Turkey. Due to a mechanical problem with the ship, we arrived in Istanbul around 5 hours behind schedule (~1:00pm instead of 8:00am).In Istanbul we had Seda for our tour guide (Curio Travel) -- we were so happy to see Seda at the port terminal patiently waiting for us all morning. With the duration of our tour cut short from 8 hours to 3.5 hours, Seda was able to negotiate on our behalf for a reduced price with Curio Travel avoiding any up front arguments over the price. Seda spoke fluent English. She knew our time was limited, so she tailored the tour in response to our desires allowing us to visit the Hagia Sofia (inside), the Blue Mosque (outside), and the Underground Cistern (inside). With time running short, she managed to squeeze in a 20-minute visit to the Grand Bazaar for some memorable photos before returning to port (no time to do much shopping).We had a great three and half-hours with Seda. She was very punctual, very knowledgeable on the history of Turkey and she had so much information to share with us during the 3-\u00bd hour tour. Istanbul was one of the highlights of the cruise. We were very disappointed that we only had a short time to spend in Istanbul (due to the late arrival). However, that was not Seda\u2019s fault. We had a wonderful experience with Seda \u2013 she turned our disappointment into joy given the circumstances. If we ever return to Istanbul/Turkey again, for sure we will pick Curio Travel and ask for Seda again."

But the moment we stepped out of the port area, we were greeted by Mustafa holding a board with the Curio travel logo.We had originally booked in UK a half day tour, but gladly converted it into a full day. We had a personal tour with one other couple of the hypodrome, the blue mosque, St Sophia's Church/mosque/musium, followed by the Topkapi palace and finally the grand bazaar.The transport was very comfortable, and the guide spoke clear English, with the inteligence to explain all the details and answer all our questions, including the reasoning for the ceremonial washing or the transition from the gambling at the hypodrome (Greek for horse stadium) to the horse trading when the city became Islam (Muslims don't gamble!).We had some helpful advice on how best to make the most of the Bazaar, resulting in several bargains before the day ended with a safe return to the cruise liner.If Curio have other excursions in other parts of the world, we shall certainly use them. Thank you again."

            "review": "Excellent , and beyond expectations way to visit Istanbul.. My husband and I had limited time ( 7.5 hrs) in Istanbul on a cruise port of call. This city has been on my wish list to visit for many years. Having researched it, read reviews and spoken with fellow travellers I was resigned to fact that if we visited a few of the top sights we would be lucky. One of my work colleagues had only time to see the Blue Mosque and Grand Bazaar, but the way everything worked out was truly wonderful.The guide Mustafa, met us at the port at 08.15. There was only another couple in the group. So a good start already- only 4 people. It really felt like a very private tour. As it was during Ramadam I had some apprehensions about being able to access the Blue Mosque. However, Mustafa brought us straight there. On the way he provided us with historical , architectural and cultural information about the city. As he is an official guide we didn't have to queue except for a short duration. Because it wasn't a prayer time we could enter straight away. Cloaks are provided for anyone whose shoulders and or above mid leg are exposed. Females must cover their heads with a scarf, or a hood in the provided cloak. Shoes must be removed and a plastic bag is available to hold them.We were allowed as much time in the mosque as we needed and points of interest were shown to us by Mustafa. On our exit the queue had extended itself dramatically, and we were told that it would now take people 1.5 hours to enter ! After some time in the open space, and historical architectural places being shown to us we walked the short distance to Agia Sophia , with time to photograph the Blue Mosque from a an amazing vantage point. Again at the church we had a detailed tour, and had some free time afterwards. There are drinks and toilet facilities easily available outside. ( ladies note there is a queue so get there quickly !) Following this , we were driven to Topkapi Palace where we were fortunate to see a loud but wonderful musical/ historical procession with people dressed in very colourful ancient looking costumes. This event happens only once each month, or sometimes once in 2 months. Again we felt very lucky. Mustafa gave us the historical background to the Palace, and brought us to specific sites of interest. We pointed us in the direction of interesting rooms - kitchen area, Harem area, and armour area. We set our own pace in viewing these. Following that , we then went to the jewel room. There is 1 room where a very unique gem is on display, which we could have queued to see, but that would mean limiting our remaining time. The 4 of us decided to skip that, so he showed us another jewell room where there are many exquisitely beautiful jewels on display. For anyone who has seen the Crown Jewels there is some similarity, and it's well worth visiting.There was no queue to this room and Mustafa said it was because the others didn't know about it. Atfterwards we were driven to the Grand Bazaar, with places of interest being shown to us en route. After some information and a short tour we were left to our own devices. I was pleasantly surprised that the shop/ stall keepers were not aggressive in their approach and didn't hassle us. Having been to Morocco, Tunisia, and Egypt I expected to want to run out of there. We took our own time in browsing and just looking and did the usual ( expected) haggling. When we took photographs the shop owners didn't hassle us for money. My husband and I split the time so that we could have a relaxing lunch in a restaurant, already shown to us, which is a short distance outside the Bazaar. I thought as it was Ramadam it might be inappropriate to ask for alcohol, so was delighted when a wine list was made available, and sure enough we toasted to a fantastic day.We met up with Mustafa and our fellow travellers at the pre allocated place and time, and were taken back to the ship in plenty of time for our 16.30 departure.Mustafa said that during Ramadam is a good time to visit Istanbul, as many Turkish Muslims do not go out to the Bazaar. He informed us had it been another time he could not guarantee such a successful day. Tesekkurler ( thank you) Mustafa and the chauffeur for a memorable and wonderful day, and it was certainly the highlight of our cruise.I would highly recommend this company."

I'd booked a couple of other private tours through this company for our cruise excursions and when they suggested a package deal for booking Istanbul, too, I couldn't resist. I knew we hadn't allowed this magnificent city enough time to truly do it justice so we really need a guide to help us understand as much as we could.Our guide Hatice Aydin was absolutely spectacular. She was a little early to pick us up at our hotel which was fine by us. We were really excited to get out and see the city. We stayed at the Magnaura Palace (see our review about that for info, too) so the location couldn't have been better to start our walking tour.Since we were right around the corner from the Blue Mosque, I assumed we'd start there, but Hatice had a better (and much, much more strategic) plan in mind. We started with Topkapi Palace and spent the rest of the day just blown away by everything we saw and learned. Hatice was not only extremely knowledgeable and professional, she was also funny and charming and savvy. If she saw a line forming or another tour approaching, she'd steer us a different way. At one time, she managed to get us around a long line entirely whihc probably saved us an hour or two waiting in the heat! In a single day, we saw the highlights of the Topkapi Palace, the Hagia Sophia, the Hippodrome, the Blue Mosque, the Basilica Cistern AND had a fantastic lunch. We even managed to spend some time in a rug store at her suggestion.I have to say, buying a rug or even seeing a rug presentation was just about the last thing on my to do list for Istanbul. I'd just heard too much about it and didn't think it sounded interesting at all. After some encouragement from Hatice to visit Topkapi Carpets, and assurances that it was no pressure/no obligation, we agreed to go. I can't say enough how incredible this experience was and how happy I am we did it. The shop owner was friendly, polite and obviously quite knowledgeable. From explaining how they harvest silk to watching a rug making demonstration to viewing their antique rugs (some from the 13th century!), we were just captivated the entire time. Needless to say, one of these antique gems came home with us.If your time is limited in Istanbul, or if you're at all overwhelmed by the vast and rich history it offers, I highly recommend hiring Hatice at Curio Travel. She filled our day in a way that never felt rushed or formulaic. She answered all of our questions with great understanding. We had a wonderful day exploring this beautiful city with her. Thanks Hatice! Amy and Andrew"

This would also be a wonderful way to spend your day if you were stoping in Istanbul on a cruise. Seda met us at our hotel and we set of walking through Sultanahmet to be the first in line at Hagia Sofia. Seda was kind, funny, and full of information. My husband is a world history teacher who asked many specific questions throughout the day. Seda easily answered all but one of them and then proceeded to spend her lunch time looking up an answer from him on the internet. She was also very flexible about how we wanted to spend our time, even adding in a stop for Turkish coffee to satisfy our curiosity. When the Blue Mosque line stretched around the building, she gave us the option of going to the Underground Cistern instead which allowed for a much better use of our time. Seda talked to us about Turkish customs, food, and culture which was interesting and put us at ease. Seda made us feel very comfortable in a new city and started our trip off on a very positive note. I would highly recommend booking a tour with Curio travel."

The next morning Hulia was again waiting for us as we disembarked with all our luggage. We had a pleasant drive in the Golden Horn area before we stopped at the Spice Market, Underground Cistern, and another smaller, lovely mosque. We were then dropped off at our hotel.

Both were excellent and covered more sites than any of the excursions offered by our cruise ship, and at a much lower cost (about $75. each). The guides made careful use of our time in both places and considered our wishes on what we wanted to see. Do not hesitate to book tours with this company; they are very professional, honest, and the guides are fluent in English and very knowledgeable. In Ephesus Ayse was our guide and Aatice was our guide in Istanbul. Because it was very crowded in Istanbul and the lines were long, we would never have gotten into the Hagia Sophia, Topkapi Palace and the Blue Mosque all on our own. In fact we heard from others on the cruise ship tours that they were not able to see inside of all these main attractions as we did. Due to the small size of our group (10) and the skills of our guide, she was able to maneuver us through the crowds much easier than the huge groups of 40 that the cruise ships have. Have a better experience by booking tours with Ephesus Shuttle and save money too!"

Firstly I would like to say how fantastic Curio Travel were from the minute we started making enquiries from home about the possibility of doing such a tour. We were not on a cruise and just wanted to do the tour ourselves and nothing was too much trouble in helping us organise the day tour. Suzan Paprat in the Curio Travel office was very quick to respond to any questions and was extremely efficient. On arriving into Izmir, Emre met us and walked us to our van and driver. Both the vehicle and driver were exceptional. The Mercedes van was very comfortable and our driver was always courteous and we felt safe with him. He always stayed with the van so we could leave bags or valuables inside without any worry. We thoroughly enjoyed our day tour which included Ephesus, Virgin Mary's House, St John's Basilica and the Artemission Temple. Ephesus was absolutely amazing and we were very happy we had a guide to explain what we were actually looking at. The Virgin Mary's House was also a very interesting place and well worth the visit. The other two sites were ruins only but still good to see. Emre took us to a lovely place for lunch (cheap and fantastic local food, great wine) that was attached to a place that made/sold Turkish carpets. We only went there because we had told Emre we were interested in seeing how Turkish carpets were made with the intention of buying one if we found one we liked & the price was right. There was no pressure to buy one and the whole experience was very pleasant. Absolutely fascinating the work that goes into them and it's great to see how they are made before the long process begins on negotiating a price that is agreeable to everybody. For the record we bought 2 carpets and were extremely happy with our selection. Emre and our driver then took us back to Izmir airport and we flew back to Istanbul. It was a fabulous day and we would highly recommend this company to do tours with. We would definitely contact them again if we are to return to Turkey to see what else they can help us with. Very impressed with their service and efficiency."

So smart and knowledgeable, as well as sweet and lots of fun. Our first full day in Istanbul was crazy - it was May 2 and a Turkish holiday, and between cruise ships in town, other tourists, and Turkish people enjoying a lovely, warm day, Istanbul was packed, and the lines for all attractions were daunting. Somehow, Seda managed to get us into various places (such as Hagia Sophia and the Underground Cistern) without having to wait in the horrifyingly long lines. She has a real passion for what she does and for her country and made both days so enjoyable. We were able to see so much of Istanbul in a day and a half and learned so much - something we could not have done without Seda. We certainly would not have enjoyed our time as much without her. I felt the price paid for a private tour for two was quite reasonable, especially given all that Seda did for us. There was an issue with transport back to the ship the first day (not the fault of Seda or Curio) due to an unbelievable traffic jam that developed late in the day (no cars could get through). Seda took the tram with us to the ship to make sure we got back - while she did not need to do this, she insisted on making sure we were ok and was so sweet about it. (PS - we enjoyed the tram very much - ended up using it the next day.) My highest recommendation for Curio and Seda - truly professional and great service."

He spoke impeccable English, and was able to answer any questions we had. We highly recommend this service to any visitors to Istanbul."

We had a wonderful day tour of Istanbul, including the Topkapi palace and Harem, Hagia Sophia, Basilica Cistern and Hippodrome, Suleyman Mosque and Grand Bazaar. The guide Gizem was knowledgeable and energetic and had a great disposition and sense of humor. She made the day with her wit and remarks and was very accomodating to our every needs. The only downsides were the horrible traffic, which were not anyone's fault but given how close we were to our Eminomu port destination she probably could have suggested leaving the van and just walking a few blocks instead of waiting 40 minutes to cover two city blocks. I also did not like that the travel agency person Suzan insisted on payments in USD at above market conversion rates after the entrance fees and parkings were paid in Turkish Lira - it seemed rather petty given the significant costs of the tour and given that they took a different approach with their sister company Ephesus Shuttle in Kusadasi. Nonetheless, they are a very good company and I would not hesitate to recommend them."

I travel a huge amount with work (150,000 miles flown in 2014) and was in Istanbul for just a few days en-route elsewhere in April 2015, so decided to book a one day guided tour through my hotel (the St Regis, Istanbul). Given that I did not have the time to research all that Istanbul had to offer, nor did I have the time to make the usual tourist mistakes of getting lost in a city I'd never been to, I booked with Mustafa. In one day, Mustafa guided me around the Blue Mosque, the Hippodrome, Topkapi Palace, Saint Sofia Church, the Underground Cistern, the Grand Bazaar, Mahmutpasha Market, the Spice Bazaar, Istiklal Street and Taksim Square. It was exactly the whistle stop tour that I wanted, tons and tons of interesting facts as we went along, and perfectly timed to my short attention span.A truly amazing day with a fantastic guide, and an itinerary that was exactly what I wanted. I cannot speak highly enough of Mustafa, so much so that everytime I mention Istanbul to anyone, I always mention Mustafa! I have a few more photos from my tour on instagram: @t_j99"

Signed up for a 1.5 day tour with pickup at cruise port (full day tour) & drop off @ airport after a half day tour - Ephesus Shuttle (Curio Travel). Suzan, who responded quickly with options & changes. The airline issued that we needed to be at the airport 3.5 hrs instead of the usual 2 hrs.. So I wanted to make sure that I can fit everything. Airline was correct, check-in/security at the airport took forever! plus my baggage ended up not leaving the airport until the next flight out! (that's another story)My party of 6, we alway start out early -- try to miss the other large tours & hopefully beat the crowds. Seda Cengiz, our tour guide was there to meet us & off we went. She spoke fluent English & full of information. She led us to all the perfect spots for photos & got us to must see areas before the huge crowds came along. Everything was timed perfectly. We had a full schedule where we saw about everything we should (all the major highlights- Blue Mosque, Topkapi Palace, Hagia Sophia, Hippodrom, Spice Market, Grand Bazaar, Underground Cistern, etc). All planned accordingly to miss waiting on long lines, etc. Of course you can save a lot more if you did this on your own (everything is walking distance) but I don't recommend it. With the guide, you know where you're going & what's the must see places. We also had limited time here We also wanted to pick up certain items & she made sure we got what we wanted -- recommended stores. I love talking with her. Seda Cengiz-She's like my best friend!!! wished I had more time in Istanbul.Thanks so much Seda!!!"

Then on the way back to the boat she showed up the most beautiful small mosque that was much more beautiful than the better known blue mosque. Seda was a gem.

Topkapi Palace, Blue Mosque, Hagia Sophia, Hippodrome and the Grand Bazaar. Our guide Gulay was a gem and she worked us through the city like pros. She offered to shuffle the agenda around to try and increase our odds of getting into everything by avoiding the main groups and it worked out perfectly. Even with the full agenda, we were able to have a little free time to shop the Bazaar as well as share a nice local lunch. As the day was wrapping up, it became clear that traffic was going to be an issue getting back to the ship in time. Gulay changed the plan the use the metro, which bypassed the whole mess and had us there with plenty of time to spare. Other tours were not so well taken care of and the ship was delayed leaving. Her enthusiasm for the city and showing it's treasures off to us was infectious and made a great visit that much more enjoyable. This was the first of 2 tours I had booked through Ephesus Shuttle (Curio Travel) and I could not have been more pleased with either of them. All of the positive reviews were well supported and I would not hesitate for one second to book with them again. Thank you!"

Our ship was late for its scheduled arrival in Kusadasi, so we were concerned that our guide might not be waiting for us or that we might not have sufficient time to see all of the highlights of our tour itinerary. Needless to say, we worried for nothing. As we arrived, Ayse, our tour guide, greeted us very warmly with a big, reassuring smile. Ayse communicated very well in English and was very knowledgeable concerning everything we did and everything we saw. She answered all of our questions and made certain that we understood everything that she was telling us. We never felt rushed and Ayse never showed any sign of impatience, even though I stopped frequently to take a million pictures. Ayse was charming and composed throughout the tour, and we felt as if we were being guided on our tour by a friend or relative rather than by someone we just met. We could not imagine a more perfect tour guide than Ayse nor a better tour experience than the one we had in Ephesus. We saw everything we wanted to see at a relaxed pace and still made it back to our ship with a safe margin of time before departure. Before we left the United States, our friends who had been to Turkey before told us that there was no possible way that we would go on a tour in Turkey without being taken to a rug weaving demonstration, a leather shop, or some other type of merchant selling opportunity. We told them that we had arranged with Curio Travel not to have any such stops on our tour. Admittedly, Ayse gave us a chance to see the rug weaving if we wanted, but there was no high pressure, and we chose not to go. The fact that we saw and did more on a private tour for 2 for far less money than we would have spent on a cruise shore excursion with at least 40 other people was absolutely amazing to us. Why anyone on a cruise ship would choose to go on a large group tour for much more money rather than a private tour from Curio Travel is incomprehensible to us."

We felt as if we were being escorted by a an old friend. She walked us through the Topkapi Palace, Hippodrome, Blue Mosque, and the markets and she took us to her favourite local restaurant for lunch. Then she helped my wife buy a lovely leather jacket. We wished we could have spent more time in Istanbul with her as our companion guide.Then on arrival in Kusadasi we were similarly met - this time by Ms. Melike. We toured the Ephesus ruins, Artemis Temple, and Sirince Village. This village in the mountains exuded such old warm charm. Melike took us to a restaurant with amazing views and warm hospitality. Sitting with Melike and her driver again felt like luncheoning with old friends. We said a warm farewell and re-boarded our ship.Their Mercedes mini-buses were immaculate and their drivers very pleasant.

The company has their act together, they are serious, prompt, no hidden agendas, discreet, reliable and the best tour guides to fit all needs. I have used other companies but I know I will never go wrong with Curio. I have used their private tour services (tour guide, driver and van), which is the best way to see and know Turkey if you are a first or second time traveler or have language challenges. They will even check you in at the hotels you are staying at and even help you with airport check in at the airport. They are also flexible in the daily itineraries and will accommodate to your needs. In other words, you are not subject to a group itinerary where the group determines your schedule. Also, their staff is soo caring and will go out of their way to make your stay a pleasant and wonderful experience. If something out of their control goes wrong, they will do everything in their power to make it it right. I did the Seven Churches tour with them in Oct 2012 ( 5 days). In Oct 2013 I did Bursa, \u00c7anakkale( Troy), Pergamon,Pamukale, Kusadasi, Bodrum, and Antalya including Aspendos and Perge ( 9 days). I also did Rhodes on my own but Curio arranged the hotel and they stored my other luggage so I didn't have to carry all of the baggage with me to Rhodes. There was storm at Rhodes and we couldn't sail on departure date to Marmaris where Curio was waiting to resume the tour. Curio arranged for an extra night at the hotel without a problem. Everything was to my complete satisfaction. Getting to know the real Turkey, its people, food and customs was a priceless experience. Curio guides did not make me feel a stranger in this country and am encouraged to repeat the experience of knowing more with them. I will do eastern Anatolia with them the next time. Every cent you pay you get your money's worth. You can't go wrong with Curio."

            "review": "Only Average. We toured with Curio Travel in Istanbul (the sister company is Ephesus Tour in Kusadasi, Turkey, through whom we also purchased a tour) in June 2013. We were in Istanbul as part of a Mediterranean cruise that also included the port of Kusadasi/Ephesus. For the money, I don't think our tour was that spectacular. Our guide was knowledgeable and friendly, and the driver very adept at navigating the huge traffic obstacles in Istanbul. The tour guide did not accompany us into many of the sites - he told us about them before we went in and then let us walk through at our own pace, which was nice, but did not help when we had a questions. Our tour was scheduled for 1.5 days; however, we could have completed the tour in a whole day. After taking our tour, I believe there are other options that help tourists better achieve their goals in seeing Istanbul. Most cruise lines offer transportation to the main tourist area of Istanbul for a nominal fee if you feel comfortable traveling it on your own, which did not seem that difficult to do, especially with detailed tour books. For the same price, most cruise ships offer tours that will allow you to see more than we saw through this tour with Curio Travel. Also, be aware, that if you want to see the harem portion of Topkapi Palace, be sure that you ask for it ahead of time. We assumed it would be included in a private tour, but we were wrong. That was disappointing."

I recently returned from a terrific ten-day tour of Turkey arranged by Curio Travel, which included hotels, flights, vans, and sights in Istanbul, Cappadocia and the western coast. We were a group of four and our guide, Emre Dasdemir was first-rate. He was knowledgeable, fluent in English, accommodated all our requests and imparted his love of Turkey to us. All we saw of Turkey was beautiful, but my favorite part of the tour was the days we spent visiting the ruins on the coast. Emre's knowledge of the history, culture and architecture of Ephesus, Miletus, Pergamon and Troy made for a fascinating experience. Highly recommended."

            "review": "Wonderful tour!. We recently used Curio Travel to book a shore excursion in Istanbul. Hussein was our tour guide. We were driven around in a very nice 14 passenger van (and there were only 4 of us!). Even though the traffic in Istanbul is terrible, Hussein made sure that we had a day that was packed full of sights and experiences. We saw the Hagia Sofia, The Blue Mosque, Topkapi Palace and the Grand Bazaar. Hussein has a vast knowledge of all things Turkish and he was amazing at making the many things we saw come to life with history. When it was time for lunch, he gave us several options and styles of food. We chose a place away from the \"touristy areas\" that made fresh kabobs and served only authentic Turkish food. It was definitely the right choice! There was only one small glitch in the day when we arrived at the Hagia Sofia, Hussein told us we needed to take all of our backpacks, etc with us (on the other 13 tours we had taken during the cruise, we were able to leave our belongings in the vehicle if we wanted to). We later found out this was because we were not being picked up by the same vehicle at the pick-up point. So, my advise is do not bring anything you don't want to carry around with you during some extensive walking times. All in all, it was a wonderful day and I'd highly recommend Curio Travel for private tours in Istanbul!"

I get to see the highlights, learn a little something and get my bearings.Hard to fault Big Bus Tours in this regard as they did everything I needed them to do for me.Bus was clean and the staff friendly. Particular thanks to Faruk who was very helpful.Cost around 110TL which gave me 24 hrs plus a bonus 24 hrs free. There are two tours..the red stays relatively central but also crosses the Bosphorous into Asia. The blue tour is less frequent (at least in winter) but travels a bit further. The sound quality of the guide through the free headphones was good and informative without being too \"heavy.\" Free WiFi on the bus was handy and relatively quick. Would absolutely recommended this if you're a first time visitor and/or short on time."

It stops at or near all the main sites, especially the Red route. The Blur route heads out to Cape Horn and some of the sights around there which are more the entertainment parks.The bus drivers are polite and helpful and it is worth getting a 48 hour extension to spread out your trip, just plan your route or be prepared to take another form of transport to get you back.The only downside was at the stop at Taksim there is a scam where a man (not working for Big Bus) entices you with a book about Istanbul (good for kids) and then asks for 40TL for it or to cover his breakfast. Even if you try and give the book back he demands money. We got scammed out of shock the first day and I let my displeasure be known and he still tried it again the second day which I politely ignored. It is a shame Big Bus allow this to happen on their watch!"

Rahmi was jovial, humorous, cheerful and gave information happily. Adnan was very clear in telling us what was and was not included in the tour and did his best for us.This is worth doing as it takes you around the area for a very reasonable rate. We would suggest taking the 2 day one as we stopped at the Dolmabahce Palace and that took up almost 3.5 hours due to a 20 min wait (if you wish to visit the harem part of the building too and don't miss the tour that happens right after the tour of the main palace.)There is also quite a bit of traffic along certain stretches of road depending on travel times. So we only had time to get off at one place when we would have liked to stop off at other areas.The tour use to end at 630pm and they have recently cut it down to 5pm (until?) due to the bad traffic conditions. We paid for the bus and added on turkish bath (entry fee only) and entry plus free English tour at the Topkapi Palace. Unfortunately, we missed the Topkapi tour as we were waiting at the wrong spot (at the Palace itself), the correct spot is to wait at the main square in the Ayasophia area. However, Rahmi was quick in arranging a refund for the palace entrance fee for us which amazed us - this is unheard of in Turkey from our experience. Rahmi should open a badly needed company specialising in hospitality and service training for the other vendors in Istanbul.He's one of the handful of people in Turkey that made the travel in Istanbul pleasurable and heartfelt - even if it was only for 15mins of our 12 day, fairly traumatising vacation there."

I like to use Big Bus when I am in new cities, as they generally give you a broad view of the city itself as well as the benefit of stopping at the main attractions.Big Bus in Istanbul was no exception. They have a couple of routes, and we booked a 48 hour pass - which was perfect for our plans. They stop at the main attractions, and if you keen on a relaxing drive between the Asian and European sides, then this was also great - especially if the weather is playing along.I find the staff very helpful and pleasant, and in this case Faruk was the guy we dealt with - very good and helpful.The hop on hop off facility just add to the ease of getting around Istanbul at a fairly reasonable rate."

The Big Bus tour allows you to get off and back on along the route with frequent buses and friendly drivers looking after you, we felt safe and in control during the whole experience. On our first day in Istanbul we were approached by Bayram outside the Blue mosque. Bayram did a great job explaining the services on offer and made us laugh with his cockney rhyming. We decided not to take the tour straight away, but there was no pushy sales pressure which is why we decided to take the tour the next day. The audio tour is easy to follow in different languages and well timed. You get to see loads of points of interest, both old and new. We got a 24 hour ticket and did both the blue and red routes in one day. I would suggest buying the 48 hour tickets and doing the 2 routes over 2 days, as it's a lot to take in and although the seats are very comfortable I did start to become restless towards the end. We caught up with Bayram as we finished the tour and we were surprised he remembered us given the amount of people in the city during the Eid celebrations. Would not only recommend but would definitely do it again the next time I'm in town"

It takes you all over the city where you see many of the landmarks that you would've missed without it. Strangely, We arrived at the time of Bayram (Moslin festival) and met a very friendly and helpful big bus guide called Bayram whom we thank a lot.

Mr. Eral, this is the name of the driver, called to the manager, Mr. Bayram. They connected with the driver of he bus, where we left the phone and when we arrived on the end station they returned phone to us, There is a greatest side of service, hospitality, attention to the tourist. Should tell that all other guys are too very friendly, politely, joyful and sensor. Also this is a good example of humanity. We are greatful to the team of Big Bus tour. Of course we enjoy the tour and Istambul itself. And separate greeting to the tourists, who found the phone and hand over it to the driver. Thanks for all good people. With love from Ukraine,"

I met Rahmi who made me feel quite at home, he was obviously made for this tourism business. Big up to Rahmi. My only concern is that with such heavy traffic the tour takes a while to maneouvre and then with the long time between buses it is kind of a disincentive to actually get off the bus except for the main stops in Taksim Sq and Sultanahmet.

I returned about 15 minutes later to discover that the Blue Line bus I was on had already departed but the Red Line Bus was there with some Big Bus Istanbul staff on board. I explained that I had forgotten my phone and was quickly reunited with it by Faruk. He was helpful, pleasant and made sure that it was in fact my phone before handing it over and he confirmed it was my phone by making sure I could open the phone.Without the staff's help in locating my phone, I would have lost many pictures of the day's journey but also run into a bunch of complications with travelling.Thanks again Faruk."

My wife and I found him very friendly, energetic, cheerful and helpful. they are lucky to have him on board.Another name who deserves a mention here is Nael at the Taxim square Stop.

We paid for it as we had visited the Spice Market early in the morning - go here early! We took the Tram and when we went to go back to Sultenmart there was the Big Bus! It was the line we had gone on the day before - the Spice Market I'd the last stop on the Blue Bus - the buses stop at many good places - the day we went on the Blue Bus we got a shocking driver who was really rough on the brake and excelerator - who did not stop at a couple of stops and then went off the route -! To avoid traffic we think - - it was a good way to get to The Dolmanche Palace and it was really good going across the Bosphorous Bridge - another \"must do\" in Istanbul. The blue bus stops at the outdoor museum which if you are into cars and trains and transport stuff is a must do."

The Hop On Hop Off bus, like in most cities, serves a tourist market that wants transport round to the major tourist sites with commentary on what you are seeing. My wife and I fit into this market and found the HOHO buses excellent value. The Istanbul Big Bus Tour is no exception.What we tend to do is do a complete circuit of the routes offered. This allows us to listen to the history of the city and sites without the distraction\u200e of hopping on and off. We then go round hopping on and off as we visit the sites we are interested in.These worked perfectly well for Istanbul - we got a history of the city plus transport to the tourist sites we wanted to visit.However, if all you are after is simply transport from one site to another, you will be better of using public transport. Public transport in Istanbul, namely the trams, will be significantly cheaper.\u200e Likewise, if you want a real personal guide to interact with, the HOHO buses aren't for you - you'd be better of hiring a guide for the day but will be more expensive."

The only issue is the Istanbul traffic which can't be helped. But it does mean even though the buses leave their start points on time, if you are catching a bus later down the line you might be waiting nearly an hour rather than 30 mins in busy times. The WiFi works great and the info on the speakers is quite interesting. The best part of the red tour is the northern bit that goes upto the new bridge. If you do this at sunset the views across the Bosphorous are amazing. Quite good value if you buy tickets online rather than on the bus, but more expensive than other Big Bus tours they have in other cities and also doesn't include an option for a boat ride like the company usually does in other cities. At Blue Mosque, Faruk was on hand each weekend to help and give travel advice, and supervisor Bayram was good at local sight seeing advice also."

Cunaide was very helpful. However we do not recommend this to general tourists. If you have a few days to spend in Istanbul, just take the cabs or the trams and you will be very much at ease and save a lot of Euros. Secondly the place near Hard Rock Cafe, was away from the main area and we waited for over 45 mins to get the bus. Very sorry for having chosen the Big Bus. We just used two hops and then gave up, and went on our own by tram, which is cheap at 4 Liras and takes you around half of Istanbul."

We bought a 48 hour big bus ticket + early tour+ phosphor tour The big bus have two lines but due to the really slaw movement of the bus we couldn't repeat any line more than once so if u saw something u like u hv 2 get out in the 10 sec they have in each station.in every station there is a bus in every 30 min if there is only one line ( every 15 min if there is two). Every thing have entry ticket which may be a bit expensive (about 40 tl) if u wanna visit all museums buy all museum in turkey ticket for about 170 tl. The early tour was walking tour with an English speaking Turkish guide. He took us to the blue mosque (very well explained), Colosseum or what is left from it which is just two coeloms ,German something which i totally missed because it was explained from far away for seconds , Ayasofia ,Grand bazar which was the last station at the tour and we were too late that we had to go back and missed it. The phosphor tour was at a two story boat , one of them is closed, the Guide spoke Turkish English Arabic with very poor dialect and very fast and he did it always in that order due to that we didn't get anything because he was speaking about something we already saw long time ago and can't see anymore. That happens at the bus as well even though it was recorded ot 8 different language each one alone but they kept mentioning thing we don't see. Anyway it is better than other tours due to the enormous amount of people living in Istanbul it is the easiest way to tour."

You'll no doubt see more of Istanbul than you otherwise would, and if you tend to walk everywhere when sightseeing then the bus tours can be a restful break. What I didn't care for was the way in which our package was sold to us. I felt the Bosphorus boat excursion was misrepresented. We were led to believe that after meeting at Sultanahmet Square we would board one of the Big Bus busses to the area by Galata Bridge to catch one of the many Bosphorus Straight cruises. The Red and Blue lines go right past this spot and have it both marked on the map and announced as a hop-off point for catching a cruise. What actually occurred is that guide walked us in a group to a small pier on the Golden Horn where we boarded our boat. At the end of the tour everyone went their own ways with most trudging back up the hill to Sultanahmet Square. At the very least the trip could have been timed to return when a Big Bus would be passing by, if not a bus dedicated to return passengers to the starting point. Not a huge deal for us, but I am not sure those much older we are, or who have difficulty walking, or those with younger children would be able to manage. I felt the whole thing was a bit deceptive, more cumbersome than it should have been, and I would suggest trying a different company for a Bosphorus cruise."

But, overall well worthwhile it, because one can see all of the city without having to walk those very very steep streets! I took both lines - red and blue. Obviously the red line has the most tourist attractions, but I thought the blue line was also good because I probably wouldn't have ever gone that direction whereas the red I would have regardless of getting Big Bus or not. And I'd recommend going early in the day. (Evening rush hour in Istanbul is the worst.) The audio function can be temperamental, so I'd recommend swapping seats even if you get looks from other tourists. Oh, and when I went in Sept '15, it wasn't 24hr service as billed. From memory, the last \"day\" tour ends around 7pm, and thereafter one has to pay for a separate \"night\" tour. Which was really annoying as it says 24hrs on the ticket!"

We usually find the hop-on, hop-off type buses very good, enabling us to see quite a lot relatively quickly and more easily and more cheaply than by other methods. However the Big Bus Tours of Istanbul left an awful lot to be desired. They were very disorganised and the commentary was uninformative. When we paid, we were told that we had to do the transaction in front of the bus in the street as they were taking photographs of us paying, and that if we refused to do it in the middle of the road, the driver would be in trouble. The Big Bus guy in Taksim Square also said that we had to get on and off the bus where there was a 3 foot drop from the bus to ground. Actually, all a real disappointment."

On this occasion we were waiting to get on the bus at one of the smaller stops for the first time. This rather dirty looking guy in scruffy clothes kept pestering us, trying to sell us tickets from his little tourist shed nearby. We eventually decided to get on the bus and pay at the main stop (Sultnahmet Square). However when getting on the bus another guy, who was wearing a shirt, claimed to work for the Big Bus company although he had no logo/uniform. He told us we should get off again and buy the tickets from the original scruffy guy even though the driver didn't seem to mind and had already told us to take a seat. We got off, bought the tickets, but the bus left before we could get back on it, even though this other guy in the shirt said it would not. All very frustrating and not the best way to start the day.The tickets seemed to be genuine enough, and were accepted, however on arriving at Sultanhamet (Stop 1) there were signs saying ONLY buy tickets from uniformed staff. Long story short - stick to your guns and don't be swayed by unofficial salesman. You can catch the bus from anywhere and ride it to the main stop to pay!"

Review: Glad to have done it; great to get a sweep of the wider Istanbul areas, to see different areas, cross the bridges and learn some historical points. I made the mistake though of taking the Red Route (below) at 4:30 p.m. around rush hour. So, as we headed through the 'new' side of Istanbul toward and over the Bosphorus bridge - we joined the thousands and thousands of cars doing the same. I have now memorised the music they play between stops on the bus - as it seemed we were mostly between stops once in that part of the city. But, at other times of day, it is brilliant and is great for getting to key points of interest over the 48 hours usage period you get per ticket. Background: The Big Bus Tour is a hop on and off tour option with two routes; both have some Old City exposure but one (red route) focuses on the 'newer' side of Istanbul (still the European side) over the Galata Bridge (it also crosses over the Bosphorus Bridge to the Asian side and loops right back without stopping) and the other route (blue route) does a loop up along the Golden Horn water way. It is 100L (30-33 Euro) for essentially 48 hours unlimited hopping on and off. They give out earplugs that you keep and then use each time you hop on the bus; with audio descriptions in multiple languages of places you see along the route."

I waited for the next coach to pull up and asked the driver to call and let the company know about it. By the time he got through, they already had found it and we're holding it for me. Faruk met me and handed my camera back to me. What excellent service! Honest and all around awesome!

Walking was the best way but after a few hours we were exhausted and thus decided to take the Big Bus tour following the Red Route. And boy are we glad we decided to do it as the ride was very enjoyable inspite the traffic at some locations. The bus took us to nearly all of Istanbul highlights. Even though we did not manage to hop off at all the places but at least it introduces us to their locations and thus enable us to make better plans for our own tour on the following days. One thing that stands out was how friendly and helpful the staffs were. One person worth mentioning is Faruk. I think he is the supevisor at the Sultanahmet Stop. After many unpleasent experiences as tourist in many other places we were pleasantly suprised that the staff of Big Bus Istanbul, especially Faruk genuinely wants to help and sincerely care that we have the best deal and experience. For all future visitors to Istanbul, this hop-on hop-off bus service is a near must. And look out for Faruk at Sultanahmet Square. He is always there with a big smile and a warm heart always ready to help. A shining example of what Istanbul has to offer."

Both leave and finish in Sultanahment.On the red line, I chose to hop off in Takism, grabbing the possibility to walk down that popular part of the city during the afternoon. Besides, apart for having a second day free (to take the same or a different ride), they offer so many extras. It was the way to go. What else did I get with my tickets? All buses have WiFi available, you can get a free drink at the Hard Rock Cafe and their free phone app proved very useful. The tickets can be sent directly to your Smartphone, and the maps are very detailed. From the open-top bus I was even able to take pictures while crossing the Bosphorus, pictures otherwise difficult to get."

You can pick two routes: the Red route which going pass the City in the European side of Turkey, and the Blue route which going pass the rural area of Istanbul. Both routes are equally interesting. You can see many sides of Turkey with those tours. While the bus is on its way, you can listen to the explanations (in 8 languages, including English) by a headset the priovide. They visit Turkish famous infrastructure like goldenhorn bridge, the spice bazaar, Taksim Square, they even recommend a famous pastry shop near the Sirkeci area. If you want to know more about Istanbul, or if you want to go somewhere to Istanbul but you have no idea, this tour is highly recommended. Also, you can hop in and hop off the bus as you want for you two days, for both routes ! So, you can get down on a stop, and catch the next Big Bus Tour for an hour (red route) or half (blue route). Really practical ! Oh, and they also have friendly-English Speaking crew, mine was Faruk whom I met onFebruary 16th. Really friendly and funny. He sings in Indonesian for our group !"

One day is nowhere near enough time to visit all the sights but on the Big Red Bus I was able to at least see them.

While we were here we got a two day ticket for theprice of a one day ticket and it was a great deal. Easier than trying to figure out the public transport and cheaper than using the cabs.Faruk and Rahmi deserve a special mention. They are excellent guides, friendly and kept us great company at Sultanahmet.Would definitely recommend the big bus tour to anyone."

            "review": "Interesting & Useful Service. We decided to take this bus on New Years Day in freezing cold icy conditions as really little else to do. If it were not for the freezing cold and our sitting in the open part on the top so as to be able to take great pictures, I am sure we would have enjoyed it more.In the morning we took the Red Bus from Taksim to the Blue mosque. We then got off and took some pictures and got our feet thoroughly drenched in freezing cold slush. We then took the Blue Bus to the cable car, and went up the mountain where we found a cafe with a wood burning fire on which to try and dry out our footwear!Returning down the mountain, we did not have long to wait to pick up another blue bus, and almost got off at the miniturk but decided not to as was near 4pm. We returned to the Blue mosque and picked up another red bus to take us back to Taksim. The bus was very full so we had to go back on the open part upstairs! Big mistake as blizzard, and it went off over the Bosphorus bridge which was freezing, so at that point we preferred to stand downstairs. Eventually the tour got us back to Taksim, cold and wet. Not their fault, but quite an adventure.On 2nd January we headed to Vialand by public transport, only to be told on arrival that it was shut yet again due to bad weather, so we got a cab to the nearby miniturk and from their picked up a Blue Bus that we knew stopped at the Egyptian Bazaar from the day before! The good thing is that when you buy a ticket directly from these guys for one day, you can also have free travel the next day, so that really came in useful, as by that time we kind of understood our bearings!!!They give you headphones to plug in. You can then select what language you want and I think there was a choice of 8. The speaker does go on a bit about \"Peace be upon him\" etc, but actually it was a good tour, albeit the music stays in your head as a bit repetitive!"

It is very reasonable and the audio guide works well. The only problem is that it stops very infrequently and you end up waiting quite a long time for it.In fact, I suspect that there may only be one bus for each leg of the tours, because I was waiting more than 40 minutes to be picked up---about the time it takes to circle the Golden Horn. Nonetheless, it was quite reasonably priced and I used it, instead of a taxi, to get tothe Chora Church (which would have cost the same) and plus got the rest of the tour.It's very nice, but keep in mind that it's not simply hop on hop off, it's more like hop off and then wait a very long time to hop back on."

I do not usually go on bus tours as they are all usually very much the same - expensive, boring, unreliable and guides who cannot communicate with you in your own language. So you can imagine how pleasantly surprised I was when I found myself having a conversation in English with Bayram (one of the supervisors of the Big Bus Tour) outside the Blue Mosque in Istanbul. He was dressed smartly, was informative, friendly and professional and, best of all, his English was superb. I asked about the two different routes the buses took and he took the time and trouble to find out what things I was interested in seeing before recommending which tour I should take. The Big Bus Tour itself was great and I am sure that I would not have been able to see so much of the city during my trip had I been trying to navigate around Istanbul on my own. It gave me the chance to make a note of places that I had seen to be able to go and visit them in more detail later in my stay. The audio supplied throughout the trip was clear and full of interesting facts. The staff on the bus were friendly and helpful. My husband and I came away from the trip knowing more about Istanbul. My husband was particularly pleased with the price! Not the cheapest tour but certainly the best we have been on of its kind and well worth the money. To top it off when we got back Bayram directed us to a local restaurant where the food was cheap but absolutely delicious. Top man!I would certainly recommend this trip to anyone looking for a good sight seeing tour of the city at a reasonable price and with good customer service. Well done Big Bus Company and a big thank you to Bayram :-)"

This is advisable for people who don't prefer to walk around.Now there are only cons:1. Frequency in one of the route is hourly. We did know this while booking but the worst part was that you don't know from what time to calculate the hour like from the start point or where it dropped last. No idea. Least they could have done is that put up a chart of timings on each bus stop. 2. Public transport is very well linked that you need not get yourself stuck in traffic forever in this bus. 3. Few Drivers drive so slow that they literally wait for the traffic light to turn yellow so that they can sit and relax. We were sitting right next to driver, first row and it was very frustrating. Such rude behaviour continued even after we informed the driver that we had take a cruise, which was also booked with big bus.4. Not all Drivers understand English. So don't expect answers all the time 5. They don't have a designated office. Once you book with someone, chances are that you wouldn't see that person again. Hence, don't know where to complain 6. Ohh to add, we took the walking tour guide as well. That was a disappointment as well. Our guide wasn't informative at all. We heard other guides, who knew so much about the place. For the Walking tour of the old city even the audio guide is a better option.In all, if you are planning to hop on hop off like us, don't go for it. Public transport is amazing and locals are so helpful."

As usual to learn about a city we took one day hop on hop of bus ( London, Berlin,... ) starting from the Blue Mosque area combining the two lines ( Red and Blue ). Wonderful experience seeing so much of the city and its surroundings even driving 2 times over the famous Bosporus Bridge and seeing the Byzantine walls at the far end of the city at the exact spot where they were shot open by the Ottoman artillery. Good experience to learn about the heavy traffic in Istanbul, especially at the Galata bridge area, taking in consideration the bus drivers that have to pass there every day! Good guiding comments although some of the headphones are not working well (should be checked and updated). Hopping of the red line at Galata bridge we had to search for the hop on for the Blue Line. Indication of that spot is bad and should be better indicated, there is no timetable, so you have to wait and hope that a bus comes soon (we understood that with the traffic jams it is almost impossible to have an idea about the time schedule ). The bus ride is the best way to have an overview of the city from the inside, for the outside take the boat trip that brings you in the Golden Horn and the Bosporus so you can see this beautiful city from both sides. An excellent attraction, but it needs better indication at and information for the blue and red line switch and audi equipment should be top at all times. We recommend this manner to see the city of Istanbul. We learned and saw a lot."

It gives you a terrific overview of one of the most alluring and beautiful cities in the world. This wasa great day and we thank Mazzur (Mazzum?)Patrick and Terry"

Hop-on-hop-off bus tours are excellent for orientating yourself in a new city....working out which attractions you really want to visit & whether they are a walkable distance to other sites . Istanbul's tour offers two separate routes...the red & blue routes...which both pass numerous sightseeing must-do's across this vast city. Naturally you have the opportunity to get off as many times as you wish but even using the 48 hour pass, you must consider the horrendous traffic problems that you may well encounter at pretty much any time of the day! Personally, we used the bus to look around the city in one trip & then shortlisted our must-see priorities....but we were blessed with ample time in Istanbul to explore it's beauty.We purchased a combo ticket which covered both routes over 2 days & a Bosphorus Cruise which we could use anytime during that week. The cruise departure times had been slashed to only two choices (10am & 2pm - picked up from Taksim Square) but it appeared we were added into another company's cruise itinerary...which was still a lovely way to spend around 2 hours but did not include all the sites we had expected to see after reading the company's brochure.Overall, these tours are good value...especially when you consider the size of this city & the risks you take using Turkish taxi drivers to get around (we found often the fares were unfairly high...a popular scam here apparently)"

Thankfully the attendant on the bus used the wifi to verify our ticket and print it on the bus. Other Big Bus tours we've been on used live commentary (real person on bus with microphone explaining sites) whereas this tour only had the option of listening to the recording with the headsets. I find when it's a person who's passionate about the place their showing and have their own personal spin on the history and sites it makes for a more interesting tour. The also drivers seemed very disinterested.The blue route was not very exciting and the red route was only marginally better. Normally we rate Big Bus tours are great because they help you get your bearings in a city and it's an inexpensive way to see the main sites before branching off on your own. The Istanbul bus is not in the category. I would just read a travel guide and enjoy the local ferries to different destinations instead."

I enjoyed crossing the Bosphorus bridge, which is one of the 2 bridges that connects Asia and Europe.The bus had an audio guide which explained key landmarks and monuments as you pass them by and they also offered free wifi onboard which was really a plus factor. You can upload your pictures taken from the bus tour instantly. Since this is a Hop-On Hop-Off, you might want to plan your day well and try to get off in key places and catch the next bus which comes every 30 minutes. The bus tour starts at 9am and ends at 6pm."

            "review": "Relaxed tour of Istanbul with a good view and with discretional stops. Hop-on Hop-off buses are very popular and available in most big cities of the World, so I will not enter into the details of the system and its advantages-disadvantages. For us is always a good way to get around the city with perfect view from the open upper deck of the bus and then stepping out to visit the attractions you want at your own pace. Clearly the bus tour is not a substitution to walking through the streets of Sultanhamed or Taksim! The ticket is cheaper if you buy it online (www.bigtours.com) and we took the 48h option which was only 5\u20ac extra. The best is (if you have the time) to do the two available tours in two days. In the Red Tour as a minimum I recommend to step out at the Galata Bridge /Egyptian Bazaar to inmerse yourself with the crowds in the markets, boat restaurants at the piers and to enjoy the view of the New Mosquee and Topkapi. The other stop Taksim with the interesting area, where you can take the old tram of Istiklal commercial street. The Blue Tour repeats the Sultanhamed part and then goes into the Golden Horn. I recommend to step out at the Cable Car and enjoy the view from the top (see photo). If you are with kids you probably should stop at the Miniature park and at the Museum.We did not have very good experience with the Istanbul taxis, they manipulate the meter or ignore it, drive fast and few of the drivers spoke english so I could not recommend a taxi as an option versus the Big Bus. The public transport is modern and works perfectly with the Instanbul card that you should purchase in advance, we used it as well, but also not a real competitor with the Hop-on Hop-off. Trams are packed full with people most of the time. As extra I would recommend you board a ship for a round tour on the Bosphorous in the late afternoon. (I wrote also a review)"

The red route is an ok way to get around, but because the narrow lanes everywhere the route is limited. Still it gets you between taksim area and sultanahmet. Still amazes me though why they always have so dull commentary?!? Me 'favourite' quote being 'Turkish coffee used to be called just 'coffee' until they introduced instant coffee in the 1980s'! The blue route is pretty pointless. On hindsight I'd stick with metro and taxi next time"

The first time round we didn't get off, just experienced the complete tour which was awesome. I am terrified of heights so the trip across the high bridge was a nightmare for me, but I went downstairs and put my scarf over my head for that section. When you have an idea of the different areas you can get off and re-join after looking around - a fantastic way of seeing the sights."

The ride in the red line around Istanbul took about 2 hours to complete except during heavy traffic, specifically, if you catch the last bus leaving at 6:30pm from Sultanahment then you will be stuck in traffic for about two hours guaranteed. Istanbul traffic sucks in the evenings. It took us 2 hours to get to Taksim Square from Sultanahmet and we were hurting from all the walking. All we wanted to do was get to our hotel and relax. I would recommend doing your sightseeing in the morning and then catching the big bus before rush hour."

We took the bus from Taksim square and the ticket was 100 TL/person. We sat on the top deck and it was so much fun. The bus provide you with earphones and you can listen to the recorded tour guide giving information about the city in different languages. The bus has many stops in its route and you can leave the bus and take it again in the same day. Unfortunately we didn't do that but it makes sense to get off the bus and on again to explore the different attractions."

It was our first day of five in Istanbul and we had planned an itinerary of places to see but then we saw the Istanbul Big Bus Tour. As I was recovering from a knee injury, this looked liked a \u2018must-do\u2019 for us and we chatted to one of the operators and got on board. There are two tours (Blue and Red) that take different routes and you can hop-on and hop-off any of the routes on any of the buses that are approximately every half hour and can use your tickets for 24 hours, not just the same day, all for 100TL (about \u00a325 at time of writing).We started with a tour that took us over the Golden Horn, through Taksim and Galatasary over the Bosphorus to the Asian side then back along through Eminonou to Sultanahmet. Rather than hop-on and off, we decided to stay on and just take in the sights whilst planning where we might want to go later in our few days in Istanbul. We did the other tour later in the day around to the end of the Golden Horn and back then the next morning we did the same first tour and used it to hop-on and off at places of interest.The big bus is excellent value-for-money and rather than have a guide telling you everything, you simply plug in the free earphones into the back of the seat in front and this tells you exactly where you are and all about the location. You also get a free map and guide leaflet. You can pick up the tour in Sultanahmet Square and get on and off anywhere that it schedules a stop.We couldn\u2019t praise this enough - value-for-money, tour, guide and a great insight into Istanbul. this is something that we did not know existed in Istanbul but are so glad we found it. Excellent throughout."

Warm fat rain but still rain, though the driver rolled a cover along the roof so we remained dry upstairs while still able to get some nice footage. Hard plastic seats, but quite comfortable and a cheap pair of headphones which you shouldn't bother with as the commentary is terrible and consists mostly of 80s in-flight music. So, on with the tour. You're given a little paper ticket which is good for 24 hours and you board at Sultanahmet Square. The map you're offered is basic but serviceable and if you're heading to places like Taksim Square it's a good way to travel up there. The route is quite pleasant though the traffic near Tunel is bloody annoying and you may want to doze off as it is rather slow-moving along the uphill stretch. How you cope with small children I leave entirely up to you. By the time you cross into Asia you're pretty much done and once you're back onto the Europe side it's worth stepping off and taking a break. In one stretch it becomes a chore but combined with a few places to cross off on the tourist list it's a much more relaxed way to cross the city. The red route is for my money the nicer of the two routes but both are worth a run at some point. The drivers are good, as are the ground staff who do their best to help you when confronted with a problem and have a good degree of fluency in spoken English. As a standalone, it's a reasonable two odd hours. Combined with one or two stops for lunch or sightseeing the hop-on bus suddenly becomes an invaluable little tool for the two days you'll be using it. Very much worth investing in for the first timer with little or no Turkish words under their belt"

I recommend this as one of the first things you do upon arriving in Istanbul; that way you can get the lay of the land and see places you may want to more time at. It's also a fun way to spend a morning when you're still a little jet-lagged. The views from the upper deck of the bus were terrific! We thoroughly enjoyed the tour, though the 2nd part that they talked us into where we had to transfer to another bus was unnecessary. It may have been good for people with kids as it took us over to the aquarium and Miniature. Also, for a few bucks added, you can get another day, if that's how you want to get around Istanbul."

Tour starts from Sultan Ahmet park right between Hagia Sofia and Blue Mosque. Opt for the 2 hours of RED route tour first as it takes you along the Bosporous into Asia and then brings you back to Europe highlighting several points of interest midway. RED tour ends at Sultanahmet Square where you can board the BLUE route which runs along the Golden Horn and includes Miniaturk among others. Buses run every 20 mins or so and therefore you can always Hop Off & Hop On to visit several areas of interest enroute. Tickets cost approx 85Euro for 24 hours tour or 100Euro for a 48 hours tour pass for a family of four (2 adults - 2 children). Note: Keep the Tickets safely as you will lose any further rides if ticket is lost.Recommended!!!"

It is an open air bus that travels to all of the key sights in Istanbul. It has a Red tour (about 2 hours) and a Blue tour (about 1 hour). You can hop on and off the bus depending where you want to go. The Big Bus comes around each stop every 30 minutes, so you don't have to wait too long when you are finished sight seeing. Also, they have a good audio program that gives you valuable information and history about key sights. It is much better than booking a tour with the many SCAM tours offered in Istanbul (i.e. they are overpriced, cramped in a small bus like cattle, and I believe the tour guides fabricate stories). Also, the English is perfect on the Big Bus audio program so you don't have to strain your ears with difficult accents. I was so much happier on the Big Bus than being scammed on the Grayling Istanbul Tour."

It is suggested that you travel to an attraction and \"jump off\" and then rejoin after you have seen the attraction. On the first day we did not do this but stayed on the bus for the full tours. This was a very easy way to get a quick idea of the main attractions and the diversity of the city. On the second day we visited a small number of places.In our opinion it takes time to see the attractions so we felt it better to concentrate on the second day.

We picked it up on the second stop as was nearest our hotel and it is valid for 24 hours so we knew it would go back to stop 1 anyway. Istanbul is notorious for its traffic but at least on the bus you're out in the sunshine (or downstairs in the air conditioning) and not on the smelly and crowded trams/buses. The earphones provided mean you can listen to descriptions and information in any one of 7 different languages. We found there were a couple of earphone ports that didn't work so you have to check that as soon as you get a seat in case the bus fills up and you miss out on the content.

You can purchase the tickets at a discount through the app (but not on the day of). We were able to purchase tickets, using a credit card, when we got onto the bus. We preferred the Red route, while we thought the Blue Route was a waste of time. There are a few mosques and Churches on the blue route if this interests you. Once you get on for the first time, they give you ear pieces for the audio tour, which is included in the price of the ticket. I used my own headphones, which worked fine. Though on the first bus, the audio cut out completely and I had to push the button to start the audio again. (This did not happened to my husband, who was sitting next to me.) If the music stops, push the button again and change the channel to your language. (FYI: Each bus might have English on a different channel.)On the Red Route, it includes going over the Bosphorus Bridge twice (going both directions). The day we went over it, it was really cold, windy going over the bridge, despite the really warm weather everywhere else. Bring something warm and protect your eyes (especially with contact lenses).

BEWARE We bought tickets in the UK and printed off the voucher with the bar code but at the joining point they could not scan it and demanded to see the original e-mail that went with the order. Others in our party had pre-paid and taken their online option to have the voucher sent to their mobile phones - again the operators had no way of scanning this and wanted to see original e-mails. So have both with you - or both saved to your phone. My husband had to open his e-mails to retrieve our confirmation there and then. Of course the phone then downloaded everything including work e-mails, junk etc and we were charged by the mobile company for each and every one! This happened to loads of people and there was a lot of delay and frustration,Something to bear in mind is traffic jams around the city which vary, but are always present. If you stay on for the whole circuit you could be a while. Make sure you take a hat and some water, although the open top bus has a shade, they do not always pull it across. Getting off the bus was no bother although you need to keep an eye on the map to know wen you are approaching your stop as you don't get a lot of notice. Getting back on the bus can be tricky as they are often full and you are relying on people wanting to get off and explore at your stop, so you can get back on! We waited quite a while for a bus at Taksim Square and there was no shade and nowhere to sit whist you waited. Not a reason to avoid this option, but keep these things in mind and go fully prepared."

On Sunday we arrived around the same time on Taksim Square to take the bus for the Blue route as the Red route we did on Saturday. We went to the same place to wait for the bus as the previous day but when it arrived it didn't stop and went onto the square again it was so full and hardly any people getting off now they said that the streets had been blocked because a marathon had taken place in that area and the police had just opened the roads again for traffic. After some complaining again we got on the bus but found out that people had gone off left there things and returned so we had to stand up which should not happen. We were still lucky to be able to hold on to a railing a few stops further we could take seats then.

The best option is to sit on the open upper deck and to plug in your earphones and listen. The audio is very informative. The bus will stop occasionally at some interesting places and you can disembark at your will. Every 30 minutes another bus comes along and you can hop back on and continue your tour. Just be sure to have your ticket with you at all times. You ticket is worth for 24 hours. This is one of the best ways to get acquainted with this beautiful city."

We stopped at diff places and had a nice time. The bus runs every 30 min and is fairly on time ( istanbul traffic being considered). Please ask for headsets and free wifi password as they are not always offered. Staff could work on their customer service skills although we dint xpct much from them so it was ok. Cheaper options like trams are available BUT i would still recommend the bus as u get 2 hear the history of where u are at any given point of the ride. NJY UR day n trip."

Since it was a website booking we got discount as well paying Euro 25.50 per person & our two kids below 6 travelled free. It started from the Sultanahmet square and we have to go to the cashier and get the receipt in the beginning. We went the blue route in the morning with the first bus at 9.15 am doing a hop off at Miniaturk and then back to sultanahmet and did the red route. And they are at the stops every 30 min and we didn\u2019t have to wait long. Both routes are great and took us to all the main places including the bhosphorus bridge and both continents.However, the traffic on the Istanbul roads are hectic such that the red route took three hours and towards the end it got blocked and we all got down and walked to sultanahmet which was faster option. I believe the 48 hours is not required since most of the tourist spots are accessible using Tram T1 and furnicular for Taksim and it is cheap with Istanbulkart."

Like others have mentioned here, I usually do a bus tour when first arriving in a city to help get my bearings, but in Istanbul, I spent time with a Turkish friend, so didn't end up doing the tour until my last day and a half...... on reflection this was a little foolish as I had already been to a lot of the major landmarks on the red tour (there are two lines to this bus tour) and the blue route I felt was rather poor.... As I only got off at one or two stops, to take a break, and eat etc, I didn't find it too bad getting a seat, or waiting too long for a bus, but I can easily see this would have caused problems if I wanted to get off at every stop. Fairly good recorded info and at least most of the ports worked but you don't get offered headphones you have to ask, same for the map. staff are just really interested in getting you to buy a ticket.... once that is done they kinda lose interest!"

We did this with Big Bus tours.The spiel sounded good - buses every 20 minutes, get on/off at any of 11 stops on a large circuit that takes two hours to complete. We were aware that we we got on the bus (Tacsim square) was very busy - but, after a bus hadn't arrived after 50 minutes, we began to suspect the worst. When it did come, our fears were confirmed. The traffic was a nightmare. The bus was overloaded (people standing) to get them out of the Tacsim area as the queue there had grown to over 50 people.Little changed for the rest of the tour - yet they were still selling tickets at several stops using the same line .... bus every 20 minutes etc. We didn't get off at all for fear of not being able to get back on ! - people were left behind at most stops because the bus was full.I really think that there should be a capacity that they work towards based on the number of buses they have - especially when they know the city is exceptionally crowded and traffic was at a virtual standstill at every major attraction.It turns out there were 4 cruise ships in port and it was a Saturday of a long weekend so big crowds were understandable ..... but all they seemed to be interested in was getting as many people on as possible rather than providing a reasonably comfortable experience."

My husband and I boarded and made to go upstairs only to find the upper level locked. Over the next 15-20 minutes we and many other boarding passengers asked the driver repeatedly if he could unlock the upper level only to be ignored or answered with abuse. Bearing in mind that todays weather was perfect for open bus travel we could not see the drivers objection???After a standoff lasting approximately 20 minutes the driver relented and finally opened the upper level,however it had clearly upset him and he drove like a man possessed for our trip to the Blue Mosque!!!Totally unacceptable behavior from driver which then made our previous experience on the 1st day pale with what we tolerated on the 2nd!!!"

We did the Red circuit first - about 2 - 2 1/2 hrs depending on traffic and then the Blue route - about 1 1/2 hrs. The recorded information in English was a bit crackly - not up to the usual standard that we have come to expect - but very informative and we found the cable car on the Blue route, which we wanted to do but were having trouble finding, so that was a bonus. I would make a suggestion for more seating downstairs (only about 8 seats) as it was very cold having been snowing the past few days, they could also have put the plastic wind protectors down and drawn the roof across - but as this is mainly a summer destination, I imagine most people prefer to sit up-top.

Next day came and we started early to make our day count and it was a pretty good experience since one stop pretty much leaves you at the main attractions which are the Blue Mosque, the The Sophia and the underground cistern and the world bazaar...The staff is not very helpful, they are always in a hurry and quickly dismiss you if you have a complaint as we observed a couple of people try to bring their issues with some staff members.

It is a little expensive, but for us it was a great way to get from the Asian side where we saw the palace all the way around to the bazaar."

There are two routes - Red Route and Blue Route. The buses run on an interval of 30 minutes. Both the routes are Circular routes, starts from Sultanahmet Square. You will cover most attractions of Old City like Blue Mosque, Hagia Sofia, Topkapi Palace by walking. The other attractions like Dolmabache Palace, Bosphorous Bridge, Beylerbeyi Palace on Asia side, Taksim Square, Galata Bridge and Galata Tower etc can be covered by Big Bus - Red Route. Red Route is the most important route. If you take a 48 Hrs Ticket, you can cover both Red Route and Blue Route. It is advisable to take the Red Route first as it covers most of Important attractions of Istanbul. Blue route will take you to the Golden horn trip. Please do not miss a cup of coffee at the Pierre Loti Cafe. You can enjoy a hot (or cold) cup of coffee with a breathtaking view of the Golden Horn. Very refreshing."

There are 2 tours with option of 24 or 48 hrs. We took the 48 hrs ticket. Did the Red tour on one day and Blue on the next. With the traffic and if you plan to hop off at some sights along the route, it will take a full day to do one route comfortably. The buses are comfy, kids loved sitting on the top though its obviously quite windy and cold and there is a plastic covering which passengers can 'pull' up during rain. The audio guide is nice and clear. We were glad we did the tours.I would mention that during our Red tour, we waited around 1.5 hrs in the cold for the bus to come to the British Council stop near Istiklal St. because of the congestion. The helpline number wasn't responding so my husband sent an email and their by email response was quick stating that the bus was coming though held up in traffic!"

Some versions of this tour include a Bosphorous tour which we did take; it was a gorgeous day and a beautiful trip but I longed for more guide information! I had my book and read along with the little information the guide provided. However, the buses were clean and frequent. Istanbul is a very large city and the two routes are useful for getting a sense of areas such as Taksim, Golden Horn, etc. Finally, (and perhaps because the city is so big) this hop-on, hop-off is probably the most expensive I have encountered in either Europe or North America."

They are pricey but if you have spent a lot of money to fly to a city you may as well pay some more and see as much as you can in the short time you have. Sadly, the traffic in Istanbul is a huge handicap to the progress of the bus and at peak times it can take a long time.We bought a two day pass with added boat tour online to save money. However, on the first day when we tried to locate the boat stop, which we thought was at the No 2 stop, we couldn't find it. It was only when we went to the number one stop, where their staff sell the tours, did we find out the boat left from a completely different area near the main square. Anyone wishing to go on the boat trip has to wait there for a guide who will then take you on a fifteen minute walk down to the mooring. Anyone with mobility issues may find the walk a little taxing. There were so many people in our group we decided when we saw the smallish ferry that we wouldn't most probably get a seat outdoors on the boat, so we gave it a miss.The blue route is a little dull apart from the stop at the Rahmi M Koc Museum which was a great attraction and should not be missed. Allow at least one and a half hours here. The red route is more interesting but sadly we went on a Thursday and two of the palaces we wanted to see were closed on Thursdays. If the driver had told us they were closed we would not have got off at that stop thus preventing us from having to wait another 30 minutes for the next bus. Not very helpful when most people only have a limited time in the city.So if you decide to buy a ticket check what places are open on the day/s you wish to travel on."

However, the overall experience for me, was just a waste of 35 Euros. Granted, today was a cold, rainy and windy day. That said, there were pros and cons.Pros: it is a good way to see the city, and could be done early in your visit. There are different languages available. The hop on/hop off feature is good. The ticket includes a 24 hour period, and for an extra 5 Euros, that can be extended to 48 hours. But:Cons: This tour, I was told, takes about 2 hours per route. There are 2 routes, and the price includes both of them. I stupidly paid an extra 5 Euros to extend my ticket to cover 48 hours. We started out from Sultanahmet area, and from Karakoy to the large bridge over the Bosphorus, we sat in traffice for 30 minutes. At a standstill. I had started out the tour on the top, but going over the bridge it became much too windy and cold. I went down to the lower level, where there was heat. However, there were only 10 seats, and all were filled. So in order to stay warm, I sat on the stairs, but then had no audio. After reaching the Taxim Square stop, a few inside seats opened up. I went to plug in my earphones, and they would not insert all the way. So now, I had a warm seat, but no audio. I rode to the spice bazaar stop and got off. I was so aggravated over this whole scenario, that I actually paid 4 TL to ride the tram back to the Sultanahmet area.So beware: if is cold rainy and windy, there will likely not be enough indoor seating for everyone. And why can't the people in charge check all the audio outlets daily to be sure they all work? How much work would that take?Overall, I feel that this was a waste of my time and 35 Euros."

The recordings on the bus that describe the various sites are available in many languages.I had the wonderful opportunity of meeting Adnan, a staff onsite on the day I decided to sightsee with Big Bus Tours. Adnan not only suggested the 48 hour pass for economical reasons (only 5 Euros additional for another 24 hours), but also that the additional 24 hours will allow me to explore Istanbul and all the sights that it has to offer at a more leisurely pace. Although I don't disagree that traffic in Istanbul can be heavy, having purchased the 48 hour pass, there was less time pressure and sitting in traffic just gave me another opportunity to absorb all that Istanbul has to offer as I gazed out of the window. Adnan was also very friendly, helpful, and humorous, all of which contributed to my positive experience with Big Bus Tours and Istanbul in general.All in all, I highly recommend Big Bus Tours for all of the reasons stated above.

We were left in some part of Istanbul that we had no idea where we were and had to get a taxi back to our hotel therefore spending more money.

If you just wanted an overview of Istanbul, the 24-hour bus package would be O.K. ...But if your plan is to hop-on/hop-off you will need the full 48 hours. To ride both lines would take approx. 4.5 hours. The buses can be crowded and at times the lines can be long to board. We purchased our tickets online without issue and saved 10-15%.There was some confusion regarding where to meet for the boat tour and when we spoke with the BB representative, Simon, he was very understanding and accomadating.***Be Warned...for the boat tour you meet at stop #1, near the Blue Mosque, and as a group of approx. 200 persons, walk down to the dock, which is approx. 10 minutes away. You do not board the boats at the main boat terminal, which is stop #2***"

There used to be many companies offering HOHO sightseeing tours leaving in front of Hagia Sofia but in 2014 , BIG BUS Tours seems to be the only one left ! We had taken a similar tour in 2013 with City Sightseeing Tours and we found that the one offered this year to be more interesting and a better value for the price . The itineraries are very interesting and they now include a more complete tour of the Golden Horn and a quick incursion on the Asian side . The audio guide is reliable and the commentaries in English , French and Spanish are quite clear ! The only areas not covered any more are the walls and the fish market ! We also found the time table to be reliable as we stopped at 3 different locations !"

Everyone does Sultanahmet Square by foot so it really isn't necessary to do the Blue Bus expensive for the price & just not worth it so ditch it as it takes you around the square & a little away from it. Red Bus passes Dolmabahce Palace, Grand Bazaar, Egytian Bazaar ,Asian side & a lot more so one can hop off & hop on after seeing these. Worth the price & enjoyable!"

The Big Bus tours came to our rescue and we went on both the Red and Blue routes. The Red route is ideal for visiting the Spice Bazaar, Dolmabahce Palace and the Bosphorus Bridge amongst many other places. The Blue route doesn't have as many of the main attractions but is good for the cable car and the Rahmi Koc Museum which, as far as we're concerned, is a hidden gem."

The first service of the day doesn't leave Sultanhamet until 10am, so by the time it got to Taksim Square (where I was staying) it was 10.45am, then another 30 mins into the Grand Bazaar, so almost half the day gone. The service, if one can use that word, needs to begin at 8.00am. And the traffic heading back to Taksim at 5.30pm is worse than horrendous. Stop start all the way. It does give one a feel for the layout of the city. And as for the incessant Turkish music between the commentary - too much of a good thing will always spoil it. And I agree with previous reviewers in regard to the cost - expensive given the lack of service. The drivers are a mixed bunch, some very friendly and others clearly forgetful that we tourists are providing them with employment. Having said all that, there's not a great alternative to get around as much of Istanbul at a reasonable cost - paying for a taxi to sit in the same traffic jam seems quite pointless."

Having misguidedly bought a ticket and suffered through the red route for a couple of hours with earpieces that only worked intermittently, I can recommend an alternative that is vastly cheaper and covers a much greater area of Istanbul. The Istanbulkart (the public transport pass). Buy one from a newspaper kiosk for $7, load it with credit at a tram stop - not difficult - and you're good to swipe your way onto trams, buses, ferries and even the funiculars. Istanbul is your oyster, for the amount a Big Bus ticket costs, you can criss-cross Istanbul many times on land and water and get a good feel for this wonderful city of 15 million. A tram trip costs a mere 3 TL whatever the length of the journey and it's much the same on the other forms of transport.One handy extra of the Istanbulkart is that it can swipe you in to public toilets which are otherwise inaccessible.No-brainer? Be brave, strike out on your own and see greater Istanbul."

So if you want to pay 45 USD to sit on a bus for 2 hours and watch Istanbul go by then this is for you. Mind you it would be cheaper to just buy a ticket for local bus and sit on that.

Purchasing a ticket entitles you to use either route and you can hop on and hop off as many times as you wish to visit attractions along the routes. The tickets are valid for 24 hours or for 48 hours (which is the better value) from the first time of use. So by buying a 48 hour ticket at 16.00 hours on a Wednesday for example you can use it all the following day and up until 16.00 hours on the Friday.Starting from near Hagia Sophia,the red route passes Dolmabache Palace, crosses the Bosphorus bridge to the Asian side and then comes back to the city via Taksim Square. The blue route also starts near Hagia Sophia and goes around the Golden Horn. Earphones are provided so that you can enjoy one of the audio guides which are available in several languages as you tour the city. If you are on a short visit to Istanbul the big bus tours are an excellent way to maximize your time."

We walked around, had a lunch and then hopped on the Red Line.

As the traffic in Istanbul is terrible (at least in Saturday afternoons, when we tried to have a tour), our bus stood in jams mostly, total red line trip took much over two hours until it became dark. At first we tried to listen to the audio guide, which actually talked about sights that had not arrived yet due to the traffic jam; then the audio guide played local music and finally, when it was dark outside and cold in bus (February evenings are cold in Istanbul, too), it stopped alltogether. Probably the drivers' working hours also had stopped as there were no comments form his side as well as no stops any more. As we finally noticed a recognizable sight of the Egyptian Bazaar, we demanded a stop and fled from the bus.Afterwards we joked, that if the three of us would have paid the total cost of three tickets to some decent taxi driver, we probably would have got a much better overview of Istanbul. On the other hand, where to find a decent taxi driver in there..."

The buses were clean, comfortable and the audio tour was helpful.Only negative would be that the music between the commentary was an irritating loop, but that's all."

We got conned into thinking this and the associated boat tour would be a good way to get a feel for Istanbul, something that we've found useful in many a city. Unfortunately we could not have been more wrong. We started with the boat tour which involved a very large group of people being herded along a not insignificant distance to the boat- the fact that the boat had a limited capacity and therefore a limited number of tickets should be sold did not seem to occur to these con artists (even though one of the ticket sellers tried to scam us into believing there was pre-allocated seating). Having been shepherded on board with not a seat to be had we ended up having to stand in the full heat of the sun for 2.5 hours. Whilst this would have been unpleasant enough, all those who wanted a smoke on this NO smoking boat trip were then steered our way as well. So for 2.5 hours we stood in the sun, the smoke and the noise without being able to hear a word of the commentary and counted the minutes until it was over. Then, having already paid for the blue line tour, we made our way back to where the buses departed from. As other reviews have mentioned there is no timetable for the buses (they only leave when the bus is full) so you really cannot use this as a hop on, hop off service at all. The early signs here weren't promising either- first the departure was held up while we waited for a Spanish couple's 2 teenage daughters to show up (it seems waiting for the bus to depart didn't appeal to them so they'd just wandered off). Secondly, all of 2 mins into the tour we pulled into a petrol station where we spent 10 mins filling up. Finally we were seemingly on our way, only we weren't because the traffic was so bad. The commentary was virtually non-existent, the route was terrible and all in all this was just a horrible waste of time and money. Save yourself the time and frustration and find a better option."

We always take a Hop on / Hop off city tour in any city offering one as it is usually a fantastic way to view a large area in an efficient way, with the flexibility to get to tourists sites that may be hard to do independently and bus tours of this type are usually value for money. Beware - NONE of those things apply to the City Windows Travel Hop on Hop Off Bosphorus Sightseeing. There are two main routes, the Imperial Peninsula (Blue line) and the Golden Horn Tour (Green Line). The ticket sellers (touts) assured us that if we handed over our \u20ac20 each fare, we could travel on either route - not so - we had to argue with the Green line bus \"host\" and he had to get our tickets altered by his boss before we could get on our chosen bus. Beware also that not all the stops marked on the glossy flyer are actually stops at which you can get off - the bus only stops at some unless you ask the on board hostess to ask the driver for you. There is also no timetable at all printed on this glossy - no start or finish time for the tours and no idea of how many buses are running hour. We particularly wanted to see two sites Eyup Sultan Mosque and Aynlikavak Palace so negotiated a stop at each. After visiting we sat / stood for an hour at each stop waiting for another passing bus. The headphone commentary is OK but as the traffic holds up the route considerably often the voice was out of synch with the view from the window, also you had to constantly turn the volume up or down as the musical interlude between speaking was so much louder than the voice track. One driver was in such a bad mood that we had to hang onto our seats as he shot along some of the few free running parts of the roads and there was no hope of taking any photos as we approached attractions that were not stops as you could not hang onto your seat and use your camera at the same time. I could write more of this but just believe me this is a total rip off - use your \u20ac40 for something else. I had read the Tripadvisor bad reviews before we made up our mind to take the bus and I should have trusted the TA community to be right!!"

I've never felt moved to post on Tripadvisor before, but this experience was so horrific I feel it is my civic duty to warn others of this shockingly bad 'bus tour'. The only reason I've given it a star at all is because it is impossible on Tripadvisor to give no stars when writing a review. We went to Taksim Square hoping to get a red City Bus Tour, like those you see in cities all over the world. Having only 3 days in Istanbul we felt this would be the best way to orientate outselves and get an overview of the city. We found a red city tour bus at Taksim square and bought tickets from a red uniformed City Bus operator. They told us to wait as we would be going on a different bus. We waited for over half and hour and then they told us they would drive us to our bus which was stuck in traffic. That was ok and off we went. We met the other bus, which was not a red city tour bus but a blue City Windows bus, and got on. Unfortunately we'd already bought tickets so we just went with it. We crawled along in traffic on a motorway with very little to see and nothing coming out of the audio guide but what sounded like Turkish progressive rock for over an hour. Then the driver tried to take a short cut and almost crashed, pitching half the people on the bus almost out of their seats. Eventually we reached the bridge linking both sides of Istanbul, this would have been a great view but we went across at a terrific speed and could barely open our eyes on the open upper deck, let alone see anything! We went up a mountain road on the other side at which point our audio guides were abruptly taken back, we had heard a total of one piece of information. A short mention of a Naval museum which was on the opposite side of the road from the side indicated on the audio guide. There was no other info coming from the audio guides, just the Turkish music. When we got to the top of the mountain we were unceremoniously dumped out and told we'd be picked up in an hour. There were a series of cafes and restaurants in this spot but nothing else and no sign of any taxis. We were quite a long way from town at this point and completely at the mercy of the unbelievably rude tour operators with no option but to eat at one of the restaurants with whom they obviously have a scam going. We were more fortunate than some of the other passengers, as one English couple we spoke to had been on the \"tour\" for 1.5 hours before we joined it, also crawling through motorway traffic. These people were meant to be rejoining their cruise ship at 9.30 but it was already 9pm (on what was meant to be a two hour journey in total), the driver just shrugged when he was told about this. I was very reluctant to eat in any of the restaurants out of principle but we decided that since they had, at least, good views, we would have something small. We got desserts in Cafe Balcoon, where staff were at best completely disinterested and at worst horribly rude. When presented with the bill, we were charged the equivalent of 6 pounds sterling more than what we should have been charged. When we queried it we were told that this was for the bowl of nuts that were sitting on all the tables! We had, between two of us, a total of 5 pistachio nuts from this bowl. We paid it, but out of principle I took all the remaining nuts, bowl and all, and told them I would do this. They didn't put up much of a fight, probably because they knew they were already taking the mickey. We eventually made it back to Taksim Square, with another 90 mile an hour eye watering flight across the Bosphorus, at 11pm. The \"tour\" was a complete and utter waste of money and time in our 3 day otherwise wonderful trip to Istanbul. Please take my advice and avoid it at all costs! We learned absolutely nothing about Istanbul, were brought to no sights whatsoever (save the admittedly nice view from the mountain we were abandoned on and preyed upon), we were treated abysmally, and it left us and everyone else totally browned off. The bus passengers were unanimously unhappy in the extreme. Horrific experience. Don't take it if you know what's good for you."

His command of the city, as well as his obvious love in what he does as a guide, was the highlight of our trip. One thing I am glad we did was to ask him where we might eat that he loves and dines at frequently, and not the traditional tourist dining options. I am so glad we did. We had some of the best food in out trip as a result.My recommendation to potential tourists would be to know what you absolutely want to do, but then work with Metin to do some things off the beaten path which will only enrich your experience and give you a true taste of Istanbul.We had such a wonderful time with Metin.

This was our first full day in Istanbul and we wanted to get a \"feel\" for the city. Ahmet was everything we wanted and more!!! He told us DETAILS that are not found in any tour book or video. Being able to ask questions and get through intelligent / thoughtful answers was wonderful. The cost of our personal private tour was so much affordable than other tour agencies that charge by the person!The colleges in Istanbul have a major for \"tour directors\" and Ahmet was a graduate of one of these colleges. The curriculum includes not only English but thorough knowledge of the Istanbul and all of Turkey. Ahmet was excellent and I'd ABSOLUTELY use him again on future Turkey travels."

He explained in a very compact and pleasant way the history of Turkey. We went with him to the Blue Mosque, to the Topkapi Palace, the Aya Sofia, visited the historic underground watersystem and had a Turkish lunch with a view over the Bosphorus. This guided tour gave good content to our trip."

And the travel consultant Melissa was a pro about creating great itineraries for our needs. Our energetic, passionate and knowledgable guide Rose met us at our hotel and we did an amazing food tour. We figured out that this was a must tour in Istanbul to be able to know each food on streets. The tour was very entertaining and Rose showed us the hidden corners of the city which were not in itinerary, off the beaten track, she made us feel so special and comfortable.At the end of the tours we said goodbye and we will definitely see each other again. I would highly suggest this company and Rose in Turkey."

This was a private tour of Istanbul combined with a cruise of the Bosphorus: Guided Istanbul tours greeted me at my hotel, and let me set the tone and the pace. I had completed some basic research and knew what I wanted to see. My guide Ahmet took this one step further and enabled me to assist him in determining what I sites I should experience to make the best use of my time. He did this by initiating a pleasant dialog that allowed me to communicate just what I wanted to gain from this personal and private tour.The tour company: Good communication, my tour was confirmed immediately by e-mail. Once I was in Turkey, I also spoke to a company representative just to re-confirm my tour arrangements. They were very friendly and helpful and let me know when and where my guide would meet me, they even let me know the name of my guide.My tour guide: He was early, in fact I was late - this tells you a lot about the tour guide and the tour company, Professional very easy going personality, immediately made me feel comfortable and welcome.Do you want someone who has rehearsed the facts and figures, or do you want a guide that sincerely knows what he or she is talking about. I felt that Ahmet was a student of his own craft, he learned the history behind places and historical figures he was showing me.I was made to feel welcome, as a tourist in an unfamiliar city and country, this is very important as well as comforting.The best thing about a private tour with Guided Istanbul Tours: They were professional, they were understanding of my needs and what I wanted to get out of this tour, they let me set the tone and the pace of my tour. Plain and simple, they gave me the Istanbul experience I was looking for. I highly recommend taking a private and personal tour with this company. You will not get the same kind of personal attention when you're shuffling around from site to site in a large group. I would book with them again, absolutely!"

His communication skills were excellent, as was his knowledge of the city and its history and culture. And I also have to mention how friendly, accommodating and helpful he was at all times. He also took us to a couple of great lunches where we enjoyed some tasty examples of the local food. It was so easy to visit the main sights of Istanbul with Ahmet as not only did he know the quickest ways to get to them but had even bought tickets in advance for the second day after he had confirmed what we wanted to see. Normally I'm happy to explore on my own and quite enjoy navigating with maps and even public transport but with limited time in Istanbul he helped to maximise my time there to see the various sights in this fascinating city."

            "review": "Great way to learn about the city and see the highlights. We booked online for a day tour to see the highlights and a boat tour, and quickly recieved a confirmation email. Ahmet met us at our hotel to start the tour. Having never had a guide before, I was a little worried in case it would be awkward, but he was lovely, very friendly, spoke fluent English and never ran out of things to tell us about the city and country, but was also very mindful of giving us space as well. Professional tour guides in Turkey have 5 years of training (inc. English and the history of Turkey) and exams before being issued with their pass, which lets them skip the queues with their group to go straight to the kiosk to pay and then enter, which saved us a lot of time and meant we were definitely in the right hands when being shown around some of the most incredible buildings, seeped with thousands of years of history. It was very relaxed, Ahmet would give us time and space to go and see points of interest, and we learnt so much about the city. We had a couple of days left in Istanbul afterwards, and having learnt all we had from the tour and familiarised ourselves with everything, we felt right at home. I would definitely recommend to anyone going to Itsanbul- it's a great way to see the key sights with someone who knows everything about them, skip queues and save time, and make sure that you don't miss anything. Also great for a first visit around the sprawling Bazaar to get a sense of how it works! We were flagging a bit at the end of the day, but glad that we'd done it, as we saw and learnt so much. There are half day options available too though if 8 hours is too much. It was raining when we were walking around, but we picked up some umbrellas from the hotel, so it didn't impact on the experience at all.Lunch and entrance tickets weren't included in the price, so do account for that, although they were all very reasonable. Thanks Ahmet!"

We were unsure about doing the tour due to the limited time we were spending in Turkey, but glad we did make it happen. It was very educational and efficient by avoiding lines. My wife and i enjoyed all aspects of the tour including the personalized service Ahmet provided. He event went above and beyond by advising us on options for money exchange and cell sim cards. Our lunch ((not included in the price) , was one of the better meals we have had here in Turkey.Key things to keep in mind: Wear comfortable shoes, and dress accordingly based on the temperature being slightly warmer or colder at the locations relative to your hotel.If you are traveling with someone who has any type of walking disability or is elderly , have that conversation with your tour company as some of the locations don't have handicap accessibility or elevators.Great tour guide and company..."

He went to college for five years and majored in tourism to be this knowledgeable. This was by far the best way to see the Old City. All walking distance from each other was thrilled to have Ahmet not only take us to each sight but tell us all about it. The time in each area was perfect not rushed and time on our own to take photos etc. This was a full day tour but you could have a cup of coffee or sit at different locations if needed.

He is a polite and educated young man who treated my family and I like his own. We arranged to be picked up at our hotel at 9 a.m. and were pleasantly surprised when he and his driver arrived early and were waiting patiently outside for us to come out. The vehicle that they chose was very spacious and the driver was very familiar with the area. We started our tour at the Hagia Sophia museum, then moved on to the Blue Mosque and Topkapi Palace. Prior to entering each of these locations, he would make sure to step aside with us and explain both the history behind the location and what special things we should be focusing on. He had a very comfortable and conversational way about him and shared lots of valuable information in a understandable and pragmatic way. He did a really great job of answering our questions, no matter how simple or complicated. He was patient and allowed my family and I to walk at a comfortable pace, never making us feel rushed. To conclude our time together we ask him to join us for lunch at a local restaurant, which he thoughtfully selected. The restaurant, Masal & Omar, was a cute little sidewalk cafe which offered a multitude of Turkish meals. He was able to assist us in ordering and went on to share with us some things about himself and his life in Istanbul. Essentially this man treated us as though we were part of his own family, which was of great relief being in an unfamiliar place. In closing, I would strongly recommend that you schedule time with Ahmet, should you ever decide to book a private tour in Istanbul. He is an amazing tour guide and lovely human being!"

Truly, there are many sights to see, many mouth watering foods to taste, and a dizzy amount of items calling you to buy them. It can be slightly daunting. Where should you go? What should you eat? Where are the best places to buy quality goods?Instead of running around town, frantic to fit everything in, with the guided day tour, Ahmet took me around to the all the major old town attractions (the Blue Mosque, Topkapi Palace, Bascilia Cistern, various monuments, and of course the Grand Bazaar). We set out from my hotel, early, and at a leisurely pace, beating the crowds. Ahmet brought the various places to life with the rich history of area. I had ample time to roam around taking pictures, and soaking in the history and culture. Ever patient, Ahmet guided me through the bazaar, making sure I knew how to get around, and get out. He was also able give me recommendations on where i could find higher quality items.All in all, it was a wonderful day, well worth the price, with wonderful company."

I asked her about this and she said she studied on her own just because she was interested. This included detailed knowledge about some Christian sites. Each day was different as we saw all the major sites in Istanbul, and more. I had her along for shopping trips and for exploring off the beaten tourist path. She was up for all of it with a warm pleasant, engaging personality. If you think you want a private guide, you want Gulnaz!"

Our tour was very informative yet enjoyable and led by a charming and knowledgeable guide Gul (Rose). The tour covered all the main sites though wasn't arduous and we had a delicious meal at a charming restaurant by recommendation. We were left to wander the busy Grand Bazaar at our own leisure and at the end of the tour our guide dropped us at the port. I would definitely recommend Guided Istanbul Tours for a very enjoyable experience."

We visited all the usual places, but Ahmet was very open to any requests and suggestions, and we also enjoyed a wonderful lunch at his suggestion. We aim to find tours in the countries we visit that are of course informative, but having a guide who was so much fun to talk with was an added bonus. We came to Turkey with no real knowledge or idea of what to expect from local people, but Ahmet certainly encouraged us to ask questions which were all patiently answered. Do not hesitate to use this service with Ahmet as your guide.

The tour felt very independent yet secure and group focused.Everything was well paced and organised. We also had plenty of time to independently explore each location we visited and felt we could ask our guide anything.

I came across a fantabulous recommendation on Istanbul Tour Studio on a travel blog and wanted a similar experience the writer had during her stay in Istanbul. I reached out to Istanbul Tour Studio right away.Regarding email correspondences:Istanbul Tour Studio is on the ball with communication! What I appreciated most was how they were willing to customize set tours on their website to fit our wants and wishes. Thank you for accommodating our wishes Sinan!Our Tour and guide experience: I HIGHLY recommend the 'Fener, Balat & Golden Horn'. We were able to customize this tour to include the Eyup neighbourhood. What an experience! I think I was on a complete high right from the start. Yasemin, our guide, met us by where we were staying in Sultanahmed neighbourhood. She is professional, friendly and a wonderful person. It felt like we have known her for years instead of just meeting her for the first time. We started with a boat ride from the Eminonu port to Eyup port. I can't swim and get sea sickness very easily, but both my husband and I found this boat ride so much fun!! We had taken a Bosphorus cruise the previous day, but found this fishing-boat ride far more fun for sightseeing on the Golden Horn and the overall feeling of adventure and exploration. Upon reaching Eyup, it was a short walk to the Funicular to the Pierre Loti Caf\u00e9. Mind-blown!!! - The view is spectacular, the famous graveyard is stunning, and the coffee house is oh-so-chic! It was a little busy, however we found a table for three with the perfect view. Yasemin and I got Turkish tea and my husband got Turkish coffee and we had a great conversation overlooking the Golden Horn. There was some construction in the graveyard I think, but even the noise didn't take away from our experience, it was just that spectacular. I am at a risk of writing a very long essay on our experience so I'll try to keep it short...We were able to experience the local life with Yasemin. She expertly guided us through the maze of Fener and Balat. We would have been lost otherwise. She was familiar with the local residents, which seemed to have made our presence in those neighbourhoods acceptable by its residents. (I would not want to see strangers walking around my home either, especially with kids around). The Chora museum was an experience in itself because of Yasemin. We had the most delicious lunch at a caf\u00e9 were the Dervishes go to talk philosophy. It was so peaceful and atmospheric. The architecture of the Balat neighbourhood was stunning. The quaint narrow streets oh-so-beautiful . I can't even attempt at explaining our experience of the Patriarchate it was just that incredible. I don't know if it was pure luck or Yasemin's fabulous timing that we reached each of these sites at the perfect time - prayer time at Eyup mosque, the tomb and, especially, the prayer time at the Patriarchate in Balat. The chanting took me away to an \"other-worldly\" place. We saw the whipping post where Jesus Christ was constricted and flogged (As per the church at least). My husband and I are not religious at all, but this tour was a spiritual experience!My husband and I were in Istanbul for a week and every day was like a blooming flower filled with new experiences, however, this personalized tour was by far our favourite day. Thanks to Yasemin for being a wonderful guide. And thanks to Istanbul Tour Studio was organizing a wonderful itinerary. Thank you thank you thank you!"

They were meticulous and creative from beginning to end, suggested new ideas (like crossing The Golden Horn with Dragon Boats), found locations for \"missions\", organized the meetings and the food, added signs for historical spots as needed and even helped find actors for the missions.I highly recommend them for any sort of company or big group event. Sinan personally took responsibility for everything in the tour, was knowledgable about the locations, was well connected and responded to all our (even difficult) requests with a smile."

We had a long weekend in Istanbul and wanted to be guided around with our children to get the atmosphere and the details that we would miss alone. Sinan followed up our requests in a professional way and appointed Bet\u00fcl as our guide. She is a gem, knowledgable, adapted herself to our children (8 and 12) who needed short and clear explanations. The lunch breaks in typical restaurants, the recommendations for the Hamam, the museums or the places to have diner were just perfect. The Bosphorus cruise with breakfast was also a highlight. We visited Istanbul as with a friend who shared her passion for the rich history and also gave us the feeling that we were off the beaten track. Thank you Istanbul Tour Studio, it was a memorable weekend !"

It meant a packed day to see the important historical and heritage sites. And remember that Istanbul, historically, was the centre of the known world. The centre of the Roman Empire, the Ottoman Empire and a few others along the way. Sinan brought the whole complex picture alive. The orthodox, the Catholic as well as the Islamic are all represented here. So to be with someone who gently points out imagery. Adds detail as necessary and answer questions with assuring ease, it makes the crammed day an enthralling experience. I came away happy with amazing memories of one of the most wonderful cities in the world. I can't praise this team highly enough. Do research their website. Highly recommended. Thanks Sinan."

Without a doubt, this was the best thing we did to visit all the sites in Turkey. The organization, managed by Sinan, is excellent and all the individual tour guides were outstanding.First, the company is extremely service oriented. Communication was excellent with Sinan, and he personally answered the phone EVERY time I called from the US despite the time difference. Everything was handled professionally, and you do not have to worry at all about the company. In addition to the tours, Sinan handled all our transportation needs to and from the airports, and we were always greeted on time and courteously by the drivers. Sinan met us at our hotel when we arrived in Istanbul on a Sunday afternoon. Since the weather forecast called for rain and strong winds on our first day of the tour, Sinan suggested that we break up the tour into two days instead of one (first day would be for indoor sites). He did this without any additional fees, and it worked out great for our group.In terms of the individual tours, they were outstanding. All our tour guides (both in Istanbul and in Ephesus) were friendly, fluent English speakers, and extremely knowledgeable about the history of Turkey. For example, our guide in Ephesus (an extremely well-preserved Roman ruin) studied archaeology in college and gave us tremendous insights as we visited all the sites. In Istanbul, the guides were just as knowledgeable, and I couldn't see how we would have been able to see all the sites without their help. In addition, we were able to see all the things that only insiders would know (for example, the Viking graffiti at the Hagia Sophia).In summary, these are the guys to conduct all your private tours in Turkey. The best, period."

A surprisingly heavy downfall of snow over the new year in Istanbul scuppered our first attempt at the tour, but it was well worth the wait when we ventured out early on 2 Jan 2016 from our cosy hotel, Ibrahim Pasha, in Sultanahmet. First stop was a hearty breakfast of turkish specialty bread, honey and creamy cheese with spicy scrambled eggs and tea or coffee. Our charming guide, Sinan, introduced the four of us to a handful of 'hole in the wall' cafes and delis throughout the morning that we would never have otherwise found, along with an informative trip to the Spice Souk. A great way to experience old and new Istanbul. Allow 5 hrs. Highly recommended!"

Booking was super easy, just sent an email with date and selected tour and timing, they reverted to me in the next 30 minutes with confirmation. on the day, we were greeted by this charming lady Didem, remember this name.The weather was not on our side, but she bring us to few little streets to discover the deep secrets of Istanbul, place that you usually don't go. Having a turkish coffee in a very stylish cafe, during she explained the history of the buildings around, visiting the church and explained to the kids the difference between aperture and exposure with a lot of patience and inspiring the kids so much, they all get excited with photography. Didem has an amazing career background and she is not an ordinary guide, which makes the experience unique. she is flexible, knowledgeable and attentive and there is no doubt she will make anyone in her tour raving about this experience. I must add that i am a spoiled person, we lived in thailand, Madlives, Vietnam and travelled half of the world. now we have tried one package with istanbul Tour Studio and love it so much, we just want to do all the remaining ones. the weather was not there but we didn't care anymore, enjoy to listen Didem, discovering all the insight of Istiklal avenue, doing some shopping at the same time. what an amazing day!! thanks Didem and Sinan. I keep the title of the greatest daddy in the eyes of my daughters.Wishing you all the success and a of great shots."

After having previously visited Istanbul for work, I only had two short days to spend in this incredible city ... yet I wanted to get a taste of what it's REALLY like. Sure, I wanted to visit couple must-see attractions, but mainly wanted to see neighborhoods, check out public transit, and dine at a typical city eatery. So I was thrilled when a manager at Soho House Istanbul told me about Istanbul Tour Studio -- and even more pleased to find out about its \"I Have One Day in Istanbul\" tour! And because I'm a foodie, Managing Director Sinan Sokmen offered to combine elements of \"Flavors of the Old City.\" SOLD!What made the tour super-special was my guide Bet\u00fcl, who's both an actual archeologist (how cool is THAT?) and a food lover. She met me at Soho House, chatted with me upfront about what I most wanted to see/check out -- and then we set off. Despite the day's rain, the two of us covered SO much ground: the courtyard of the Topkapi Palace, Hagia Sophia Museum, Underground Cistern, Spice Market. Did a bit of scarf and jewelry shopping at the Grand Bazaar. Took a public ferry to the \"Asia side\" of the city, and ate at a locals-only restaurant where Bet\u00fcl knew the kind waitstaff. And she offered to spend even MORE time with me by walking me through one of Istanbul's hippest, trendiest districts. Not only is Bet\u00fcl super-smart and engaging, but it felt like spending the day with a like-minded \"citizen of the world\" who just happened to live in Istanbul and knew the city intimately. And the fact that I was the only person on the tour made it that much more special. I can't recommend Istanbul Tour Studio -- and Bet\u00fcl -- enough. Can't wait to return to Istanbul and take a much more in-depth tour with her next time! It was WELL worth the price, and then some."

I expected lots of people but I guess it's a well kept secret, so far! Betul Basak was my guide, and we had a really great day together, exploring the cuisine of Turkey in both knowledge and through our tastebuds. This also involved lots of close contact with the Turkish people, sellers, traders, makers, cooks, chefs and waiters. It's a real insight to the culture and the way things are done in this part of the world. We had a relaxed breakfast with a variety of foods, plus bread that we picked up from a local artisan bakery; we then tasted baklava in the original 'mother of all baklava houses'. Walking to the Spice market we explored all the stalls, stopping at Betul's favourite cheese, olive, pickle and fish stalls, dropping in to the kitchen supply shops, checking out the dried veggies hanging outside the spice kiosks....then in the covered part of the market we spent time drinking teas and tasting various products from pistachios to golden berries, and discussing saffron and pomegranates.....before heading onwards to eat lunch near Taksim Square at Bayvore, including a spinach/omelette/pastry/anchovy thing which was delicious! All ended at the Manda Batmaz coffee house where we had a rich, chocolatey Turkish coffee. I recommend this tour and especially my guide, Betul Basak."

We spent the next five hours exploring six different neighbourhoods in Istanbul. We were both on the European side and the Asian side.Kerem was our knowledgeable and personable tour guide. He was familiar with just about all of the artists that we viewed. He shared his views on Turkish culture, politics and sports. We tucked down alleyways, we ventured into roped off parks and lurked in locations we could bot have possibly found on our own. At the end of the tour we visited the offices and studio of the arts collective that this group runs. No hard sell, just exposing us to the work of a bunch of creative people in the city.In my humble judgement the street art scene in Istanbul seems to be in its early stages of growth. It is not quite as developed as say New York City or Buenos Aires. Some of the art might be a bit crude and not too refined. As a tourist also, you need a bit of the symbolism explained to you. So don't set your expectations to the notion that you'll see Banksy's throughout the city.Initially we thought the price tag of $95 was a bit pricey. But after our five hours with Kerem we thought otherwise. It was a great way to spend a Friday afternoon. He booked a table at Asmali Cavit for dinner for us and later joined us for a pre-dinner drink. Two thumbs up from this traveller for the Istanbul Studio Tour."

Betul has an incredible knowledge of history and archaeology ... as I was the only one on the tour, there was some flexibility in terms of what I really wanted to see and what I could pass by. Next was the 'Flavours of the Old City' tour with Betel and another couple which was a real treat. Betul took us to authentic eateries and the Bazaar ... I had literally walked past some of these hidden gems.Not content with exploring Istanbul alone, I headed to Izmir for the 'Ephesus and Virgin Mary' tour with Gulden ... (or as I called her 'Golden' ;) Gulden had an amazing knowledge of Ephesus and, once again, I alone had the pleasure of her company, so we were able to go at our own pace. The pick up and drop off from the airport was seamless. At my request, we made an extra stop at the Temple of Artemis. Gulden also helped me get an earlier flight back to Istanbul so I wouldn't be stuck at Izmir for two hours. Both Betel and Gulden asked questions to ensure I was happy with how the tours were progressing plus they gave me time alone to explore temples, etc.I'd highly recommend Istanbul Tour Studios - Betel and Gulden were fabulous guides, illuminating Turkish treats that I'd otherwise have missed."

We had already toured on our own the Galato Tower, taken a one hour Bosphorus Strait cruise, and enjoyed all the offerings at the Spice Market and Grand Bazaar. We really wanted a guide to share the history of the Blue Mosque, Hagia Sophia, Topkapi Palace, Basilica Cistern, etc. We were so fortunate to be assigned Selen Nur Caliskan as our tour guide. Our \"Texas\" ears had no trouble understanding her English. She was extremely knowledgeable on the history and customs of each attraction we visited. We have friends who are spending several days in Istanbul and we were thrilled to recommend Selen and Istanbul Tour Studios."

Ask for a discount if the price seems unaffordable! We were given the option of money or an extra tour for free do to the size of our group. I wish we had more times to experience some of their other tours. Highlights: - Sinan, the tour guide, was friendly, knowledgeable, and took the extra mile to answer questions or give us a good lunch recommendation in the area. Great at email communication! - Many of the churches, mosques, synagogues, or other areas of worship you could not find on your own. Even with a map they are hidden behind unexpected doors. - Even if you came to Turkey to look at Mosques, the Christian churches are worth the stop. The Roman Catholic Church we stopped at was jaw-dropping beautiful. - The best part of the tour was to see some of the stops during worship time. My only request would have been to talk more about the rituals we witnessed, or see more of the services in-session. We understood this is hard due to different holy days or overlapping service times. Note: You WALK the entire tour, which our group loved. As long as the day is not too hot this is great! You are going up some hills so people may get tired. Just know not to expect an AC tour bus between stops."

We toured in Istanbul for 5 days; Ephesus for 1; and Cappadocia for 2. All 3 guides were superb in their knowledge of their subject areas as well as fluent in English. They were pleasant and engaging and excellent ambassadors for Turkey. The drivers were also top-notch and saved us the anxiety of driving in an unfamiliar country.  We've had the opportunity through the years to do extensive world travel; and consider our decision to work with this company among our best. We were able to design the itinerary we wanted rather than the experience of a tour company telling us what stock package they provide. The owner, who served as our coordinator, was available whenever we had questions and provided immediate assistance when a flight from Izmir to Kayseri was cancelled. My only hesitation is with the food tour. Although we enjoyed it very much, it was pricey relative to all the other tours which we considered to be excellent value."

If the tour lived up to its description, it would have been quite good - but this wasn't the case. For example: \"You are here to watch how simit... is made.\" - We had bread bought for us and we left without seeing anything being made.\"Here, you savor a typical Turkish breakfast...\" - quite a good breakfast! Not as much option as in our hotel though.\"Taste the world-famous Turkish dessert: Baklava... Here, the baklava masters will give a brief on how it\u2019s made\" - They did not, but we at least got to eat some. However, it was the guide who gave a description of the making process, not a 'Baklava master'. \"Turkish coffee... learn the tips for making the best Turkish coffee in the world.\" - we were referred to YouTube, with no other information. Yes, seriously. \"Lunch time...\" - the restaurant had very poor food hygeniene, and we both got very ill later that day (nothing else in Turkey has caused anything like this). As for the guide - quite friendly, but spent entirely too much time on his phone instead of talking to us. Made us feel quite uncomfortable by the end. Also talked quite a bit about Turkish culture, but not so much about food as you might expect. The tour would benefit from having lokum (Turkish delight) in it at some point. In conclusion, we can not possibly recommend paying so much for this experience."

Everything went exactly as planned and the tour was very reasonably priced. Our tour guide was Yasemin, who was born in Turkey, but spoke English very well. She was extremely knowledgeable, great with our kids and a very easy person to the day with. Yasemin even helped me maneuver the Grand Bazaar, finding the items I was looking to buy. She was also able to manage the crowds and prepared us for what was coming next. We had a wonderful lunch where Yasemin was familiar with the staff and they had our table ready when we arrived. We were able to see much more of Istanbul during our short stay with Yasemin, than if we spent the day on our own. Not to mention, we were learning something new throughout the day.

We decided to use Istanbul Tour Studio to discover the city over two days and we are so happy and thrilled with our experience. Our first tour was part of the traditional culinary walk mixed in with a bit of the day tour. Our guide treated us to the best Turkish breakfast we had in the city, in the gorgeous and up and comign neighborhood of Karakoy. What I really liked about the experience is that we were either just us or in a small group which definitely meant we could really go in-depth during our tour, really seeing areas of a very busy city that we would have never been able to find on our own. I felt like we had a really good friend taking us around his city and giving us a little taste to further discover even later on our terms. We also got to visit some neighborhoods like bebek (with a starbucks that had the BEST view of the Asian side!) don't worry, we had coffee elsewhere ;-). I discovered a top brunch spot and we were even able to take a historical boat on Bosphorus to visit 'Asia', seeing a beautiful panoramic point where many locals sip tea with friends. One of the highlights for me was checking out local street art, a topic I cover in my blog in Florence and wandering the Asian side, stopping to get local treats like semolina and salep, a warm drink that was so needed on these very cold weather days. I have been on a lot of tours all around Europe but this was by far one of the top ones, we met a stranger and ended up leaving a friend. I hope to be back in this beautiful city and I will definitely use them again!"

Erbil was able to provide insight on the various artists, the evolution of their personal styles, their interrelationships with one another, and the history of this artistic medium from its roots in American rap-inspired graffiti to its more recent manifestation created by artists with fine art academic training.

It was cool to have translations of some of the graffiti and hear the background and meaning of it. I'm looking forward to keeping up with their artistic pursuits via Facebook!Luckily we had a great day for our tour (after a week of rain and clouds) and enjoyed walking around all the streets off Istikal and near Galata tower, Beyoglu and Ortakoy. We had great fish sandwiches for lunch in ortakoy (much better than the one we had from the fancy boats near Galata bridge). We then got to take the ferry over to Kadikoy (which was great as I hadn't had a chance to go to the Asia side on my previous trip to istanbul two years ago) to see even more art.A lot of walking, but totally worth it to see such a vibrant side of Istanbul!

Sinan's command of English is impeccable. He is kind, funny, charming and knowledgeable. He really takes exceptional care of everyone, young and older, making sure that all parties are enjoying the amazing sites. He led us through the Sultan's Palace, Blue Mosque, Hagia Sophia and the Grand Bazaar expertly supplying detailed descriptions of what we were viewing. It was like taking a terrific college History course...without the quizzes! I recommend that you research no further...Sinan is the man to show you Istanbul."

Luckily, I found Sinan's website and signed up for the jewelry workshop. Instead of just spending the day hanging out shopping at the Grand Bazaar, I hung out in a real jewelry workshop with 2 very talented jewelers, and made my own piece of custom jewelry! Aran taught me metal cutting, welding, polishing, and everything it takes to create a unique pendant to take home with me. Much better than anything I could have bought in the bazaar! I was staying far from Sultanhamet, and Sinan even met me at the Hilton ParkSA and took me to the bazaar on the tram personally, pointing out the history of the area and giving me a mini tour of the bazaar as we walked through the back alleys to the workshop. Very cool experience, I would highly recommend it for anyone who wants something beyond the typical Istanbul tour!"

We found him such a good guide and delightful companion that we engaged him for an additional day to give us a combined gustatory, shopping, historical tour of Istanbul. It was an extremely personalized tour and gave us the opportunity to see more of the 'non-touristic' part of Istanbul. We are big foodies and he was able to direct us to a large number of great meals, including our target: new Turkish cuisine. We are a family of 5, but it was clear that he can provide tours catered to every type of traveler and every taste. He's a sophisticated guide who can give you a good view of local culture. He speaks English and Spanish. We have friends coming to Istanbul in the near future and have already hooked them up with Sinan."

It was one of our favorite experiences from the whole trip! Over the course of our 3 hour tour we walked around Karakoy and Taksim neighborhoods, discovered some streets and areas we never would have come across on our own, and more importantly got a really great insight into current culture and politics in Istanbul. We were in the country during a time of some unrest (there were protests regarding the accident at the mine in Soma) and it was amazing to see the street art we saw reflect that in almost real time. Our guide, Sinan, made the tour both extremely insightful and interesting, but also very low key and personal. We felt like we were being taken around by a good friend rather than following a stiff tour around a city. Can't recommend it enough - great way to see a very different side of the city!"

From my very first email asking for tour options I dealt personally with Melek Ada who organised my travel from start to finish. On my request she added a side trip to Gallipoli before an extension to Jordan. It was also very comforting to seek her first-hand advice during the recent political unrest in Ankara and Istanbul. Melek's professional approach extended to a late adjustment to my tour which was handled seamlessly, giving me an even better tour for no extra charge. Organisation for tours, transfers, flights, and hotels was first class and I have enjoyed such a wonderful trip, including Istanbul, Capadoccia where I had the most amazing hot-air balloon trip, Ephesus, Pamukkale, Troy and Gallipoli. Fabulous from start to finish and would love to go again to see Capadoccia in winter. I have found the Turkish people welcoming and helpful, even though I speak no Turkish. Highly recommended!"

We even feared that we would not find a flight from London, after spending Christmas there. But we did! And we had an awesome time! !!:)))At first it was just my husband and I traveling from New Jersey. I found TSC travel after a long online research. Ms. Melek was a great travel expert and answered, patiently, all the questions that I had. So the land package with internal flights were booked. Then, my daughter who resides in Abu Dhabi, said she would join us; and then get friend who resides in New York City also decided to join us! Ms Melek was so patient, understanding, and accommodating, that she deserves a crown, really. When the arrangements were completed, were so excited and could not wait. I don't want to bother you with all the details, but from the moment of our arrival at Cairo, transfers to Giza and Cairo hotels, until our departure, the trip was top notch. The drivers, the egyptologists and the sites were incredible! Their pride at sharing with us their heritage and their history. Such humble people...the fact that they appreciated our visit even more, during a time when most travelers are afraid to go. The feeling of helping the economy while having such a wonderful time, is really hard to describe. The pyramids were more than what we have seen in history books and movies.Please go see the amazing catacombs in Alexandria. A Nile river cruise can't be missed. So you can visit the temples along the river banks. The dam in Aswan, the colossus of Menon, the God Sobek in Kom Ombo. And a hot air balloon in Luxor.Finally, the Cairo museum, which, will be final piece to bring the puzzle together. A must!I have to share with you, that years ago, I used to be travel consultant with a world renowned travel company. I knew what I wanted, and how I wanted it. TSC travel and their great staff, delivered 110% of the time. Thank you Ms. Melek! :)So, don't be afraid. Go to Egypt! Go with TSC and you will be protected, informed and most importantly, you will have memories to last you the rest of your lives!!!Sincerely, Elizabeth and Howard"

While I was initially skeptical about booking an extensive tour online with an Istanbul travel agency, I'm very glad we did. Okan Kutlu was so helpful during the booking process -- even going so far as to call me from Istanbul to help me make some customization decisions. When my daughter lost her passport in the airport at the beginning of our trip, our tour guide, Mustafa Ozdemir, spent several hours of his personal time at the airport with my daughter and husband locating and questioning numerous airport and police officials and was able to find her passport -- something we would not have been able to do on our own, since very few of the officials spoke English. In addition to saving the day (and much of the trip) by finding the lost passport, Mustaf expertly guided us through a wonderful tour of Istanbul, Ankara, Capadoccia, Konya, Heiropolis, Ephesus, Troy, and Gallipoli (and other wonderful attractions along the way). We would not have fully appreciated all that we saw without his assistance. The tour package included many meals and tourist class hotels. With the exception of Le Bleu in Kusadasi (a wonderful hotel with a balcony view of sunset over the Aegean), the hotels themselves were older and showing their age. however, the staff at those hotels more than made up for the lack of fancy accommodations. We particularly appreciated the staff at the Ferman Sultan in Istanbul and also the staff at the Grand Anzac in Cannukkale, who made breakfast an hour early to accommodate our schedule. However, you might consider some hotel upgrades if more plush accommodations are important to you. We also want to make note of the 2 very professional, skilled, and safe van drivers TSC Travel provided -- one for our 3 airport transfers in Instanbul, and the other who picked us up in Ankara and spent a week week driving us around the Turkish countryside and back to Istanbul. I highly recommend TSC Travel to anyone planning a trip to Turkey."

I was out of the airport in no-time and we drive to my hotel. The room was ready - beautiful room on the 23rd floor with a view of the Bosphurus. Marriott Sisli was definitely a great choice that TSC made for me. Great front desk staff, large rooms, I had explained to Okan of TSC exactly what I wanted out of my short time in Istanbul, and he made it happen. The dinner TSC organized for me was spectacular. We went to the 365 restaurant. Delicious cutting edge Turkish recipes in a 21st century presentation. I was advised where to walk around, what bars, shops, malls I would enjoy. Perfectly arranged weekend."

We went to Istanbul on the 1st week of Dec. 2015. Everything was very organized, from Airport transfers to hotel stays to daily guided tours. We stayed at a beautiful hotel steps away from Basilica Cistern, Hagia Sophia and Blue Mosque. Mustafa was a wonderful guide and very caring (he didn't want us to get lost in the Grand Bazaar). Visited the Spice Market and couldn't be happier with the purchase we made. The Turkish Delight was a big hit when we got home. Okan organized our trip to every detail and everything went accordingly. Can't wait to go back and do the rest of Turkey. I will definitely contact TSC Travel."

My family and I went on an amazing trip throughout Turkey that I would highly recommend to everyone!We started our five day trip by flying into Kayseri where our driver and our excellent and knowledgable guide Koray Yasa was waiting for us. From Kayseri, we drove to Cappadocia, where we spent the next day studying its unique beautiful landscape, bargaining for the best deals with local artisans, experiencing turkish dancing first-hand and discovering the caves rock formations that ancient Christians had made their homes during times of persecution.The next day was just as interesting as we travelled to Konya to learn about the poet Rumi and Sufism, a religious movement within Islam.Following our exploration of Islamic culture on Tuesday, it felt as if we went back in time on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday because of how many Hellenistic cities we were able to discover as we travelled to Turkey's west coast. Our stop in Pamukkale contained the ruins of an ancient health spa, where weary travelers from all over the ancient world tried to get better. Similarly, our stop in Ephesus revealed a massive ancient city, where 500,000 ancient people lived at a time. Finally, our stop in Pergamon on Friday showed a unique ancient on a magnificent hill that overlooked the countryside.This is just a taste of what we experienced in Turkey and this review does not fully capture all the great experiences and meals we had. What I will say in closing was that our tour guide Koray Yasa was excellent. His knowledge of the archeology greatly improved our experience and his kindness made him someone we were happy to have around.I cannot recommend this trip more to anyone who is looking for a true adventure that they will never forget."

Initially, our travel agent had us booked on a different tour but following some internet investigations I decided to \"take a chance\" with TSC Travel. They were much cheaper than the original travel co. and our agent had no previous dealings with TSC so we were a little apprehensive to start with.We were staying in Istanbul the night before and received a \"welcome\" pack from TSC delivered to our hotel room. In the pack was some relevant itinerary information etc. some cute souvenirs and some local sweets. The following morning we were picked up from our hotel and driven to the airport for the 1 hour early morning flight to Kayseri. Upon arrival at Kayseri Airport we were met by our transfer driver and then journeyed the 1 hour to Goreme', here we were met by our tour guide for the next 2 days. The whole tour was faultless. Our guide was thoroughly knowledgeable on everything and place we saw. She was simply wonderful. The transport was excellent, the Driver was waiting for us when needed. The inclusive meals were great. The itinerary was very comprehensive and complete. We had a wonderful visit to Cappadocia, made very special by the TSC Travel people.The only complaint I could possibly make was the transfer back to Kayseri was not pleasant. The driver seemed to be having a bad day and was driving a bit more radically than is the norm in Turkey."

We booked a 9-day tour with TSC. From the beginning Okan was very responsive and helpful in planning our trip. We really wanted a small group, not too much road traveling, clean hotels, etc., and he made sure we had all our needs taken care of. Our trip included Istanbul, Cappadocia, Konya, Pamukkale, Aphrodisias, Kusadasi, Ephesus, Pergamon, Troy, Canakkale and Gallipoli. All was very interesting although Konya is a very important historical site for the Turkish people was the least interesting in regards to things to see. Troy is one of those places you feel you must see but the horse there is a replica and there is still some controversy as to whether this place is the actual city of Troy or just another ancient city. We had Mustafa for the majority of our tour and he was very knowledgeable on the history and culture of Turkey as well as a lot of fun. Ebu was our guide for Istanbul - a professor of art history, he was an encyclopedia of information related to Turkish history. Both were very responsive to our daily needs and we would highly recommend them. The hotels TSC booked were adequate - some better than others. Many of the meals provided were buffets and were also adequate. I'll review the locations, hotels and some of the restaurants in separate reviews."

I did a 5day tour including Capadocia, Pamukhale and Ephesus and everything went according to schedule: daily transfers, hotel checkins, daily tourist guides, all internal flights. And this is quite important. Having said that my experience was a bit disappointing. Everyday guide tours will take to your tour and...they will basically force you to pay a visit to a leather factory shop, or a silk shop or any other place where they can make more Money using your time. I felt I was being used. Imagine that everyday I woke up around 4am to catch a flight and by mid afternoon after my tour I would like to enjoy my time at my hotel, but we lost 30min in a local shop that was not scheduled anywhere. Sorry TSC, but you must be more transparent here and tell customers in advance. This sucks! Quality of restaurants in everyday tour were poor. Big buffets with good variety and poor quality. No sign of a homemade turkey cuisine or something memorable. I was expecting more. Finally, Mustapha was our best guide in the week. Very attentive, good sense of humour."

Booking the trip was easy and straightforward and pleasant. The staff (Okan) were very responsive and made everything smooth. The trip to Cappadoccia from Istanbul was handled very well and went like clockwork.The experience in Cappadoccia was amazing. The guide on the first day, Alp, was incredible and provided a huge amount of information on life in the area area since the Hittite empire into the foundation of Christianity through the present day. He had a very completely knowledge of the history and geology of the region. The Fairy Chimneys, cave dwellings and the Open Air Museum were very fascinating. On the next day, the trek through the Rose Valley, with Safaida (spelling?) was great, next time around I'll have to hike more, it was beautiful. Also her knowledge of the history and thorough, particularly with respect to the archaeology of the underground cities. Cappadoccia is a wonderful area, and I would recommend anyone visit. I would also recommend TSC Travel. If we're back in the area, I'll book tours with them.My one and only gripe was with the pickup on the trip back to Istanbul. If it were up to me I would have arranged the pick up an hour earlier (even though the hotel manager waved it off and said we'd be fine). We ended up in Kayseri airport with about a hour before the flight was to take off. As it turned out, the flight was delayed and the huge line moved quickly enough to make the flight. I tend to like to leave plenty of time before flights."

Due to time constraints, we had only 2 days, one day at Kusadasi and Ephesus and one day in Istanbul however with our great guides they made them incredible.   Phylliss met us at the Kusadasi Port, and we began our day. She greeted us with a gentle smile and is very enjoyable to talk with. We quickly learned she is very knowledgeable and always allowed us to take our time and just to enjoy the view, .  The traditional lunch that was included in the plans was awesome, It gave us a true taste of Turkish flavor. At each of the areas we visited with her, everyone was so friendly and made you feel like you were just part of the family. Her timing made the entire day very pleasurable! Istanbul, is simply amazing and i hope that you get the chance to experience it with the same guide we had.  Moustapha was simply AWESOME!. Because of the need to make some \"Real-Time\" adjustments( which were out of our control) , to our travel schedule he was able to handle the requests we had and make changes as we were enjoying the sights, always making sure he was present for any questions.  We never felt rushed, and allowing us a very relaxing ride to enjoy the Bosphorus Boat tour without worry. At all of the sites, we explored he would explain to us about the area, and what we wanted to make sure we saw, even taking us up to certain spots, to make sure you see a certain view of an area. He always gave us time to explore on our own as we visited sites, and always gave us time to ask specific questions while touring about the area we were in. Again, at the right time, Lunch was provided and this gave us another wonderful experience of the Turkish food, and enjoying the flavors and still having time to relax. Moustapha covered a lot of of area in our time with him, and we will have fond memories of our visit in Istanbul because of his efforts.  TSC is a truly a complete agency, Okan had arranged our transfer from the hotel, I was a little worried since it was a very early pick-up, Moustapha again called and followed up and confirmed the transfer. The driver was very friendly and got us to the Airport very quick in time for us to enjoy breakfast before our flight. Words are not enough to express our appreciation for the services that TSC provided to us for our time in Turkey.

This was our first trip to Turkey, and I inquired by email with several agencies on line about just gullet sail-boat cruises, as well as TSC since it was reviewed on TripAdvisor. TSC replied the next day, and the same associate worked with me in planning the cruise and then customizing an additional week around it. I had specific sites and cities I wanted to visit, and they came up with a custom itinerary, with a comprehensive price including airport transfers, three flights, three hotels, plus the week cruise. It took dozens to emails, but just one phone call, and a leap of faith. But now I can recommend them without hesitation! The hotels were great boutique hotels. The four day tours turned out to be pretty private affairs in luxury vans, with friendly, knowledgable, professional tour guides. The only glitch was that two of the hotel to airport transfers were pretty late (45 min and 60 min) since they were picking up from several hotels. But calling their 24 hr help-line got us information about the drivers, and we did make it to the airport in enough time. Pegasus Air also lost a suitcase in transit, but thanks to TSC we had a driver waiting at the airport, and made it to our private tour of Ephesus; the suitcase was awaiting us at the hotel when we checked in at the end of the day. We spent another ten days in Istanbul on our own, and that worked out fine. But it was GREAT to have TSC organize all the other days. We managed to efficiently and comfortably squeeze in many wonderful experiences in Turkey thanks to them. I think it might have even been more economical than if we had tried to purchase all the hotels, airfares, taxi rides, and group tours on our own. Thanks a million TSC!"

It was meant to be a small tour so us 3 and 2 made 5 - a good number. Our male guide was excellent. He knew it all but didn't bombard us with facts as some do. He just gave us enough then allowed questions. We went to all of the highlights - no queues, no fees, no fuss. On another similar tour some time back we'd paid quite a bit then been asked to pay the entrance fees. He got us in quick - around the queues - and always pointed out bathrooms and drinks if we needed them. He took us to a marvelous restaurant for lunch. Top food. Top beer. As it was Ramadan it was quite empty. The highlight of the tour was going to the Roman Cisterns - something we really wanted to do. Awesome. We spent some time there. We also saw all the Museums, palaces, markets, churches etc. BUT - and its a big BUT - we walked to them all. It was so easy. Anne is not a great walker but she loved it. Everything is so close. And this was part of the tour - down back streets - into little alleys - around markets. so exciting and fun. Tim - our son loved it.I'd highly recommend them. We were dropped back to the Conrad without any mention of tips - as some do - with their veiled messages and boxes. But we did tip as it had been a wonderful day. Thanks to all involved. Well worth the money and time. Highly recommended. Happy to answer questions. Special thanks to Okan and Summit (apologies for spelling)."

Okan is very patient and answered all my questions regarding traveling alone or with a family member. I was unsure about the financial aspects of the final payment being in cash but I trusted Okan and it was fine. I really liked all the places that they picked to visit in Turkey. I was happy with the hotels in Istanbul (although it changed when we arrived) and in Kudasasi. All the transports were timely and so were the tour guides. We were pleasantly surprised to receive a welcome gift bag. We liked that the hotel was a close walk to the historical area of Istanbul and an easy walk to the town center of Kusadaki. We were happy with the hotels and all the meals that were included in the tour. The tour guides were knowledgeable of the history, the sites and the cultures. They all spoke excellent English and are personable. I am probably not spelling the names correctly but each day in Turkey we had a different guide, Samet, Iilicu, Boorjah, Felicity. They were all wonderful. I liked that the tour company is flexible. One day there was a half day tour and we were unable to go in the morning so they arranged for us to go in the afternoon. One of the sites was closed on a Monday so they provided us tickets to attend the next day. We were promptly met in Athens and liked the hotel there on our first and last night in Athens. The second day we needed to walk with our suitcases (the hotel stored luggage that we did not need) to another site to meet up with our 4 day Greek tour with GO tours. We had a wonderful bus driver, \"George\" and tour guide Melista (spelling?). Her English is excellent, her historical knowledge and Greek mythology knowledge is impressive. George is an amazing bus driver. He drove 900 miles and fixed the air conditioning of the bus on the way back to Athens. We saw amazing sites during those 4 days. My only negative is some of the hotels that we stayed at, especially in Delphi. My previous experience has been everyone on the tour stays at the same hotel but I guess I booked tourist class vs first class and it was worse than Motel 6 in the US. Fortunately, it was for only 1 night at each stop and our fellow travelers were lovely. Back in Athens we did the 1/2 day city trip which was amazing since we also got to see the Changing of the Guards at the tomb of the unknown soldier. The tour company is also flexible to arrange a ride to the ferry vs airport. I would rec"

            "review": "Excellent Tours in Cappadocia. We booked the 2 Day \"Cappadocia Explorer Tour\" and then decided to add on a 3rd, day-long tour rather than simply head back to Istanbul on our 3rd morning. The actual tours provided by TSC were outstanding. Both guides we had (Mansura for our 2 day tour and Recep for our 3rd day) were friendly, personable, very knowledgeable about the attractions and the area in general, and well-organized. The tours did a good job of avoiding the worst crowds and attractions that appeared to be \"tourist traps\" and left us feeling that we had seen a good portion of a vast and fascinating region. The crafts demonstrations all were very interesting and offered high-quality merchandise. Unlike some of the other companies whose reviews I read, these were a small (and in my mind appropriate) part of our tour as opposed to being a focal point. The included lunches ranged from acceptable to very good, and our lunch on the 2nd day was a very nice overview of Turkish cuisine. Our groups were kept small (4 total people for the 1st 2 days, 8 for the 3rd) and this allowed us to enjoy the experience. My only complaint is that the time between transit to and from Istanbul and the tours is very tight. Our flight from Istanbul was delayed by an hour, and had our entire tour not been on it, we would have missed part of our itinerary in Cappadocia. On our way back, the shuttle was late leaving for Kayseri airport, went to several pick-ups who weren't there, and stopped for gas with a van full of people who were very close to missing their flights. We did make our flight, but did so by clearing security at the posted boarding time. Another delay made it a moot point, but it made for a less than relaxing end to an outstanding tour. However, despite the transit issues, I feel TSC is worth traveling with and its tours were superior to those that we saw going on around us. I was very happy with our Cappadocia tour and I would recommend TSC's packages to anyone who wants a comprehensive look at this vast and beautiful region."

The hotels (especially Heybe Hotel in Goreme and Sentido Suites in Kusadasi) were excellent and the meals were delicious and plentiful. Our bus was very comfortable and the itinerary included all the highlights we hoped for. Mustafa inspired us with his passion and insights into the rich cultural and political history of his country. There were numerous 'wow' moments including Cappadocia and the ancient cave churches, Rumi's tomb in Konye and the ancient ruins of Ephesus and Aphrodisia. There were a number of shopping 'opportunities', leather factories, carpet factories, potteries where we were treated to demonstrations of silk spinning, carpet weaving and clay wheel work. These were highly informative and entertaining, however on occasions the salesmanship afterwards took up rather too much of our limited tour time. A lasting impression is of the great camaraderie that developed throughout the tour, led by Mustafa with his infectious cheeky sense of fun and great energy. We would highly recommend this tour."

When we began to plan the trip I had read reviews about TSC that were so positive I contacted them. We suggested sites and Okan immediately sent possible itineraries. He even gave us a telephone call to answer some of our questions. We settled on a 10 day tour with a 7 day group and several days in Istanbul at the end. We had some trepidation about traveling with a group because we had never done so, always travelling on our own. But we need not have worried. When we met the other two couples on the tour it was like meeting old friends. We immediately bonded. And with the addition of our WONDERFUL guide Koray Yasa, the trip was great fun and all we could have wanted.Koray was very knowledgeable about all the sites and he made history come alive. . He also patiently answered our constant questions. He was positive, fun, and accommodating, and each day was another great adventure. Whatever our needs, such as changing the order on our itinerary, or help finding a camera shop when our camera died, or finding the nearest rest stop, he'd make it happen. And our driver Suayip was very competent and made us feel safe in the spotless van. Our hotels were lovely, the beds very comfortable, and the breakfast spreads delicious. Our 7 day tour ended and we spent another 5 days in Istanbul at a great hotel in the heart of the old city where we could walk to many major sites. Okan arranged for the hotel and two days of touring Istanbul with a lovely and knowledgeable young woman . He also neatly arranged all the transport to and from the airports. It was a trip of lifetime thanks to Okan and his team. I would recommend TSC Travel to anyone who wanted to visit Turkey."

We bonded like family. With small groups, you have more time to marvel all the historical sites. We took the 10 day/11 night trip and covered a lot in that time.

Okan is a pleasure to deal with in terms of his professionalism and helpful suggested tours to suit our own personal travel arrangements, and also with his quick and polite responses. .It was so good, after travelling such a long and tiring journey from Australia to Istanbul, to be met and cared for so well on arrival by the TSC staff at Ataturk airport and to be so comfortably and courteously whisked off to another world. From the moment we arrived, until our departure, all elements of our travel and care went like clockworkMustafa was our guide this year. He is excellent, very knowledgeable, polite and friendly and his English is excellent. He could answer all our questions in relation to culture, tradition and the sites. . The tours and sites Mustafa took us to were great, as well as the delicious lunches of traditional and local cuisine. I would therefore recommend TSC highly.Regarding the hotel we stayed in, whilst the staff are very helpful and attentive, , I would recommend you request an upgrade to a deluxe room. The Ferman hotel is perfectly positioned as all the sites are within walking distance, and it is perfectly placed to enjoy a wonderful evening stroll to the nearby shops and eateries and local bazaar. The atmosphere in this location is everything you expect in terms of safety, and Turkish hospitality.I have no hesitation in recommending TSC travel to any Australian travelling to Turkey."

Okan and all of TSC Travel are there to make sure your trip runs smoothly. If you have any concerns along the way, just contact them for assistance. The hotels we stayed at were comfortable and pleasant tourist class hotels. All the people we came in contact with were helpful, positive and attentive to our needs. Our itinerary included all the \"must sees\" on our list of things to do. We enjoyed Istanbul, Capadocia, and Ephesus in Turkey. We dreamed of longer stays on Santorini and Mykonos. The richness of history and culture in this region is exceptional. Go TSC!"

            "review": "It couldn't get any better. My wife & I spent our honeymoon in Turkey on a trip put together by Okan Kutlu at TSC. The trip was based on where we wanted to go & what we wanted to see & do, not just a predetermined trip like so many others offer. The ability to customize our trip was a big plus. We initially had several different places in mind & Okan was quick to respond with detailed breakdowns of what it would cost to do each location, and with the option of various levels of accommodation in each place. His communication was excellent & he was very quick to respond to any questions or concerns I had.We visited Istanbul, Cappadocia, and Kusadasi during our stay. This included guided day trips to Pamukkale, Ephesus, Hagia Sophia, Blue Mosque, Grand Bazaar, Spice Market, Bosphorus cruise, Topkapi Palace, Goreme Open Air Museum, hot air balloon ride over Cappadocia, plus plenty of free time on each are to explore on our own. We also added a few days on in Kusadasi at the end of our trip to relax & explore the area by ourselves.All hotels, transfers & domestic flights were included in the cost of the trip. TSC made everything incredibly easy. Additionally, the fact that you fly from place to place saves a ton of time & lets you see more things in a quicker & more comfortable manner. Many of the trips offered by other travel agents have you traveling around by bus. That means you are sort of forced to eat in the out of the way places that cater to busses full of tourists rather than the good spots where the locals would eat. Additionally, you are spending half of your vacation driving around in a bus with 30 other people. Thanks to TSC, we were able to avoid that kind of nightmare, and for the same cost many of the other companies charge for those awful bus tours.We stayed in the mid-level hotels & they were all fantastic. Our hotel in Istanbul was in the heart of the old city, and walking distance to a lot of sites, shops, restaurants, bank, etc. We had an amazing view from the rooftop bar of the Blue Mosque & Hagia Sofia on one side & the Bosphorus on the other. In Cappadocia, we were greeted after a rough flight by the owner & his assistant. They were incredibly friendly & welcoming, and showed us to our room... which was absolutely beautiful. TSC had provided us with a lovely gift to congratulate on on our marriage. It was like something from a movie! In Kusadasi, we stayed right on the water at a very sleek, modern boutique hotel. We ended up befriending the woman working the desk & her husband, and have remained in contact with them ever since. All the hotels were charming in very different ways, and all were clean, comfy, close to everything, and with incredibly nice & helpful staffs.All of out tour guides were amazing as well... great personalities who seem to love what they do & enjoy sharing their beautiful country with us. During our tour of Istanbul, we were accompanied by only a pair of older ladies, one of which had a leg injury & they had to sit out parts of the tour, so we basically got a private tour. Our tours in Cappadocia & Ephesus were private, just us & the guide. Our trip to Pamukkale was a small group of about 15 people. Most travel agencies would charge a fortune for private tours, and it would be next to impossible to have a small group or private tour if you were on one of those bus trips. Less people in your party means being able to see what you want to see, not having to compromise for a bunch of strangers.I truly cannot imagine how our trip could have been any more perfect. We can't wait to visit Turkey again, and will undoubtably be using the services of Okan & TSC again."

My family (including two kids, ages 14 and 11) returned yesterday from a week+ in Turkey, with 2 days / nights in Cappadocia organized by TSC Travel. The experience was magnificent; and the level of professionalism by Okan and his team was impressive. My numerous pre- and mid-trip email questions / requests received responses within hours; and the level of detail around the planning and execution were exemplary. But, what truly blew me away was the value delivered on my investment. For what I considered to be a very reasonable sum, we received: flights to / from Instanbul, ground transport, private certified guiding services, admission to attractions, amazingly educational tours at artisans' studios (hand-made carpets, ceramics, and onyx), exceptional meals, and two nights' stay at a memorable cave hotel. More than once I checked my bill to confirm that the fee was, in fact, for the group...and not a per-person fee. This left plenty of our trip budget to spend on other Cappadocia attractions that were not included in the tour (most specifically a surprisingly expensive -- but truly unforgettable -- hot air balloon ride). I certainly intend to return to the region. When I do, I will definitely look to travel with TSC again."

He was full of anecdotes and background information of great interest to us. But more than anything we felt we had made a friend. Okan ensured our stay in Istanbul was a happy and memorable trip for our family (parents and 2 adult children). This is a 'must do ' tour !

I had the great privilege of visiting Turkey in October 2014 on the \"Magic of Turkey\" tour organised by TSC Travel. It is a 6-night, 7-day tour visiting several museums and the most popular sites of Turkey such as Cappadocia, Pamukkale, Hierapolis, Kusadasi, Ephesus, Troy, and Gallapoli. I was in a small group which made the experience much more flexible and personal. It was a magnificent tour and an experience that I will always treasure. I left Turkey with an appreciation for its rich history and vast variety of natural scenery that are unique and no-where else to be found in the world.What I liked and appreciated most of the tour were, for example:* a cleverly designed itinerary that includes all the top sites without over-filling the daily activities;* the quality of the tour guide (friendliness, competence, knowledge and professionalism)[Koray Yasa];* ample time allowed at sites to explore on our own - which suited me brilliantly being a keen photographer that always takes a bit more time to explore and get the more special pictures;* the flexibility of optional activities that are available (at extra cost of course but that's expected and normal);* the competence and professionalism of the driver and worth mentioning is that he cleaned the mini-bus, especially the windows, every day to allow us to enjoy the scenery while on the road;* the seamless arrangements and logistics;* the suitability of the accommodation (there was only one hotel that I may comment somewhat negatively about but all the rest were excellent);* ample meals with plenty of good food;* the helpful and professional pre-tour arrangements by the online travel agent [Okan Kutlu] - I did receive a misspelt flight ticket at some point, but that was sorted quickly.I can highly recommend TSC Travel with a warm and content heart!Tom Brown, South Africa"

To this day, I reckoned it was the best decision made as the services were impeccable, highly reliable and certainly recommended. On most days, meals were provided. Even though, we opted for the cheaper hotels, on hindsight, we should have gone for the luxury version as the price difference was not considerable. In summary, we had great meals, great hotels, a knowledgeable and well informed tour guide Mustafa and a ball of a time. Highly Recommended!"

I was a bit reluctant when asked to pay the full amount weeks before the tour date but relieved once the day arrived. The email correspondence between myself & Mr. Melek was very helpful - he answered patiently all my queries about the tour. The tour was amazing, we were picked up at our hotel in Taksim (Rixos) at 4:30am by the driver and taken to the airport where we headed to Cappadocia (1 hour flight from Istanbul). Upon arrival another driver was waiting for us, took us to the tourist information area next to a restaurant where we had our breakfast & soon enough our tour specialist, Mensure, arrived & gave us the agenda of the tour. I booked a day tour to Cappadocia - so I wasn't able to experience the Hot Air Balloon ride as they operate during sunrise and sunsets only. So in case you want to experience it, you have to at least spend the night - which I will be doing during my next visit. Cappadocia is a very beautiful city, and TSC made it more beautiful by giving us all the information about this magical city. The fairy chimneys were just surreal. A must see indeed. We were also taken to so many places such as the Open Air Museum, Pottery, Weaving, Ceramic, Jewelry, Churches still having the Frescos - really amazing experience., and the panoramic views of Cappadocia - in the end we were taken to the Pigeon houses where we saw the hot air balloons starting to fly :D I'll treasure that sight always. It is also nice to experience the Cave Hotels - seen them as we were driving along the city. The locals are friendly and very helpful to the tourists. A lunch buffet is also included in this trip and the lamb kebab was the highlight of my meal ^_^ An open WiFi is also available in this restaurant. Thanks again TSC for making my Turkey trip an unforgettable experience. & I will definitely use their expertise once I'm back to Turkey."

I organised this trip for our team of 20 people. As, this was our first time to Turkey, I needed lots of information to ensure a smooth and enjoyable trip for my group. I made several tour enquiries to few travel agencies. Eventually it was TSC Travel who provided me with a more reliable and value-added tour packages compared to other agencies. Okan was always prompt In providing detailed answers and great suggestions. He made all arrangements smooth and painless for us, from tour itinerary to lodgings. The hotels provided were amazing with great locations, views and comfort in Cappadocia and Pamukkale. We thoroughly enjoyed our tour especially the Cappadocia hot-air balloon and Rose Valley walk.Special mention also to Mustafa, our tour guide throughout our trip. He was knowledgeable on the history and places of Turkey. Oh yes, not forgetting the bible of our trip: TSC Travel Guide book that was provided (can be downloaded on their website). It provided knowledge and relevant informations about travelling in Turkey.An unforgettable trip that I will be talking about for years. Thank you Okan, thank you TSC Travel, for the speckless tour plan.With pleasureLarry Wee of AIA Singapore"

English spoken with a very heavy accent, in some cases. Also, the guides seemed intent on getting a specific message out, rather than listening to questions and trying to provide the specific information that the tourist wanted. Side trips to rug and pottery salesmen, who sometimes with used some strong sales pressure was not appreciated. All in all, very happy.

We have just returned home after a trip to Europe. Mostly we travel independently but decided that in Turkey, we needed a guided tour so we booked the Magic of Turkey Tour with TSC. We were expecting an English speaking tour as nothing in our communications or reading led us to believe otherwise. Imagine our shock when we discovered that we were the only English speaking people in the party of 12. The guide was bilingual, but with 10 Spanish speakers and 2 English, the conversation was heavily weighted on the side of the Spanish. We were also disappointed that the one time that we travelled with other tourists, we could not communicate with them. Also the 6 days and 5 nights was a bit misleading, as the first day starts in the late afternoon and the last day finishes early in the morning. However, it was still reasonable value for money. We chose the tourist class hotels and were perfectly satisfied with our accommodation and the mini van was comfortable and the meals were okay. Overall the tour was fantastic and covered all that we expected - the balloon ride is a must, even though a bit expensive. We would have just liked a bit better communication. If we had known that we were on a bilingual tour we would have either opted out or learned a bit of Spanish, but we weren't given the opportunity to do either."

She even invited us to her wedding the following week (unfortunately, our travel plans did not allow us to accept). The balloon flight on the next day was also a highlight. The hike up the Rose Valley on the following day, with a group of about a dozen people, was a bit long, but very interesting. We would also like to thank Okan Kutlu at TSC Travel for all his hard work on our behalf when our flight from Kayseri to Istanbul was cancelled due to thunderstorms over Istanbul. He was able to get us an additional night at the same hotel in Goreme (Doors of Cappadocia, which was a lovely place and very convenient) and reroute our flight through Nevsehir the next day (including transport from Greme to the airport) to get to Istanbul. The evening our flight was cancelled, we ran into a family who had been in the group on our Rose Valley walk. The said that their tour operator was of no help\u2014they could not get any accommodation that night in the area nor a flight to Istanbul and ended up taking a fourteen our bus ride to get there.

Through an exchange of emails with Melek, all was quickly arranged to our complete satisfaction, from a pick up at Istanbul airport to the transfer back to the airport at the end of our stay. Everything went extremely well and we were very pleased indeed with our experience overall, the tours and the hotel chosen for us in Istanbul. The only downside was the hotel in Kusadasi. It was a large tourist hotel well out of the town and catering mainly for Russian or eastern European tour groups. Once there, you were pretty well trapped. For a couple such as ourselves, wishing a free day in Kusadasi, we would have been much better in the town itself. However, everything else was excellent, the arrangements went smoothly and without any problems, and we thoroughly enjoyed the tours themselves and our experience of Turkey. It's a great country to visit and we found the local people we met very friendly and helpful."

It started off well with the email contact and being able to make changes to the itinerary so thought all was good. The tour itself is not cheap especially for Turkey, the first day in Kusadasi with the tour of Ephesus, was amazing and our tour guide was great, despite the information they gave us about not being able to pick us up because it was 45 minutes out, when it was only 15 minutes out from Kusadasi. We had a great first day and were looking forward to the next 2.It started off badly on day 2 as we thought we were having an early start but having missed one of their emails, a 9 am pick up went to 10.30 am from Kusadasi. Our guide left a lot to be desired and his English was a challenge, the lunch was average and they only thing we did all day was Pergamon and travel on a bus for 8 hours to Cannakale. The guide got off the bus some 3 hours before the end. The hotel which we paid $ 350 USD for 2 rooms was $ 100 USD per room when we arrived, (apparently you can choose your own hotel to suit your budget, but we were not made aware of this). We complained as we were a family with kids 12 & 14 and our 2 rooms were at either end of the corridor, the guys their were great but the Helen Hotel is not worth what you pay for it. The next day was off to Troy and then Gallipolli. The guides on these 2 tours were great, but it is a very long day starting at 8.30 am and arriving at Istanbul at 11 pm. Gallipolli tour goes for 4.5 hrs and then the trip to Istanbul is 5+ hrs (not helped by a bus driver that didn't go the speed limit and we had tomato trucks passing us - very frustrating) Given the high price, relative to everything else we did and paid for on our 5 weeks holiday (including a 7 day cruise), we would not recommend the tour to others"

He always tries his best to help us and accommodate our requests including those last minute ones. One of the examples includes that we requested to return to a valley in Cappadocia for sunset shootings, and Koray and the driver did make our day by making our dream coming true right around sunset! The final highlight was a pleasant surprise. The roof of the hotel that TSC booked for us provides a fantastic view on Golden Horn and the city of Istanbul. Our shootings ended up with landscapes of beautiful Istanbul with sun set and at night. It was a perfect finish of this unforgettable trip.Tour package charge from TSC was very reasonable. Furthermore, TSC\u2019s policy to keep groups small (no more than 15 tourists per group) adds another beauty of the tours organized by this travel service provider. During the course lasting more than 10 days, each tourist is given sufficient attention and care. We enjoyed this trip very much.

I checked online and liked the options offered by TSC, and booked a 4 hour tour. It was an excellent experience, and our tour guide was friendly, informative and very bright. I would definitely use them again when i travel to Istanbul for a more extensive trip."

TSC was one of 2 travel agencies that actually told us that it could be done and prepared a package for us.Okan was very helpfull and patient, answering all my pre trip questions.They sent all the vouchers, a guide and some souvenirs in a package that was delivered to our hotel.We had 2 guides who were absolutely amazing, in Kusadasi and in Capadoccia.Hotels were really nice, transportation was in new cars/buses. 85% on time for pickups.Restaurants included were good (2 buffets and 1 no-buffet).No problems with airlines tickets. Everything worked well.Great trip to Turkey!Tips: If visiting Pamukkale...it is a 3 hour drive from Kusadasi, each way. Bring a towel and dress as if you were going to the beach.The carpet place were they take you in Kusadasi is amazing. You are guaranteed to buy an authentic carpet and that most of the proceeds go to the ladies who make them. It is a teaching weaving and tradition school. I didn\u00b4t really liked to other factories (onyx and leather), but the carpet place is very interesting and educational.Kusadasi is 1 hour drive from IzmirGoreme/Capadoccia is a 70 minute drive from the airport"

We did the 10 day Turkey Specialist Tour which included 1.5 days of tours in Istanbul; 1 full day walking tour right from our hotel and half day tour of Bosphorus Cruise and Spice Market. The walking tour day was very full and beautiful. Our guide kept us on time and gave us a great historical overview then time to take photos before meeting again. The half day was very different. We were given no preparation for what was happening but taken from our hotel to a central meeting place for all the buses. People were then moved from bus to bus according to which hotel they were staying in and maybe by which tour they had booked. Our native guide then talked about local issues as we were bussed to Spice Market which we loved--so much more fun than Grand Bazaar---and then we took the Bosphorus Cruise. It was a beautiful day so very enjoyable but we were disappointed that it went only west from the dock so we did not get to seeother points farther east that we had really been looking forward to seeing from the water's perspective--like Topkapi Palace. We were also very happy we had booked an extra day in Istanbul to explore more on our own and revisit our favorites. Our tour planner, Okan Kutlu, had given us a list of suggestions including travel directions! We took the tram easily but avoided taxis due to all the bad publicity they have received. Sultanamet is very walkable."

Also for fellow Muslim travelers, the tour was great in seeing Islamic sites, learning history, and even on the road at designated pit stops our tour guide told us where we could pray and gave us time to do so.

In the itinerary it said the optional balloon ride was $175 per person, in Cappadocea when we decided to sign up for it we were charged $195 US, the guide said the increase of $25 were due to last minute sign up. If that is the case then they should make it clear from the beginning of the additional charge for last minute sign up, there were 4 people in our group, that makes $100, we could have saved this money for a nice dinner."

It packs a lot into ten days. TSC\u2019s general manager, Okan Kutlu was consistently responsive to any questions we had or issues that required resolution. This modestly priced tour ($1,350 per person) delivers real value for your money. The best thing about the tour was the excellent, friendly and knowledgeable tour guides that TSC chooses to accompany you. As our first introduction to Turkey, it was a good choice.You have to accept compromises when choosing a low to mid-range tour. The main compromise on this trip was the forgettable dinners at the large hotels we were booked into. The food was routinely buffet-style, the quality of which all of the guests on our tour found disappointing. However, breakfasts were fine, and we had some excellent lunches on the road in small restaurants.Normally, a summer TSC tour is 35-40 persons. We traveled at the end of November and enjoyed an almost private tour of 10 people for the first six days, and only 4 people for the last four days. Go to Turkey off season and avoid the crowds! This is particularly salutatory at popular sites like Ephesus and the Grand Bazaar in Istanbul. Our guides confirmed that places like that guarantee a wall-to-wall, sardine-like experience in the high season. Check the long-term weather forecast just before you leave, and pack for changeable weather. We had two days of rain in ten, and the early morning balloon ride in Cappadocia would have been unpleasant without warm clothes, hats and gloves.We purchased the Istanbul \u2018Turkish Night Out\u2019 for $75 each as an extra. It promised an evening of fine Turkish food, song and dance. The show was \u201cVegas Style\u201d, the belly dancers had unnatural, grapefruit-sized breast implants, and at the end, danced for money stuffed into their bras which we found very tacky. The food was boring, chicken (again!!!), the vegetables over-cooked, and the appetizer dish forgettable. Avoid this extra, it did not deliver.That disappointment aside, we heartily recommend TSC Travel!"

It was terrific as were our guide and driver. I loved that there was no pressure to buy anything at the workshops that we visited.We also had the privilege of visiting the site of Gobekli Tepe - a 12,000 year old temple complex still being excavating. This was another day trip and it was fascinating. Our guide was so proud of his city and of the sites he showed us, it was a pleasure to spend the day with him. Highly recommend this very organized travel planning group."

We had two wonderful guides on the two days who were not only very knowledgeable, but also very friendly and helpful. We loved the hotel we stayed in in Goreme, especially when our host made up sandwiches for us for breakfast when the shuttle bus arrived early to take us to the airport! Okan was very good to communicate with before the trip and we were very satisfied with what was offered. Our only snag was that the shuttle driver to take us to the airport in Istanbul had trouble finding our hotel so we just got to the airport in time!"

What impressed us was his willingness to make a last-minute change to our plan when there was a misunderstanding in our disembarkation time from our cruise ship in Istanbul to start our tour of Turkey.Our tour offered very good value for money. The travel plan was well organised, the hotels good and our tour guide Filiz speaks good English and most informative.All of us in the group (26) had an enjoyable and wonderful; experience of Turkey.

The fact that Okan was so prompt with his email replies made organising the tour through email an easy task. The tour guides provided were very knowledgeable and jovial people. Ali who accompanied us to Pammukale was extremely insightful and was a great person to chat with on the 2 hour journey to and back from Kusadasi. Both the hotels provided to us in Kusadasi and Capadocia were good with the former being an extremely accommodating hotel.Review of Kusadasi Hotel : http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297972-d306213-Reviews-Efe_Boutique_Hotel-Kusadasi_Turkish_Aegean_Coast.html All the internal flights were well timed and the cars provided for internal transport were very comfortable. The drivers chosen by TSC were very careful while driving ensuring safety and also provided us water bottles upon arrival at our destination, something we greatly appreciated as my family and I traveled in summer. Okan himself was very prompt with his meeting time on the first day at my hotel in Istanbul to explain the tour to me. In terms of price, from my research, I found TSC to be reasonable especially from the quality of service that we received. During one of my flights, the airline company misplaced my luggage and Okan has been helping me since to locate my luggage with the relevant authorities. This just shows that TSC is not just a regular travel company as they make sure their guest have a great time while with them."

When we arrived our tour guide was waiting for us with at the airport and brought us to our tour group. The choices of stops and visits was perfect. Our guide in Cappadocia spoke excellent English and added lots of local history and stories at each stop. Our lunch restaurant featured a bountiful buffet with lots of delicious choices. Our hotel was a newer property, The Doors of Cappadocia located on a hill overlooking the city with a fabulous swimming pool deck. Our guide took care of the arrangements for our sunrise balloon ride and evening Turkish night dinner. The balloon ride was absolutely breath taking and fantastic. TSC delivered everything they promised, were accurate in all of their descriptions and provided an excellent value.

It took us almost 23 hours to go through customs, and much to my surprise, our driver was still there waiting for us. And it was just like that for the ret of the 5 days. We had a private guided tour the first day. The next day our driver was there at 4AM to take us to the airport to go to Capadochia . Once there our driver and guide were waiting. We had a full day there and the next day we did the hot air ballooning flight. They driver and guide there were excellent and went out of their way to take care of us. Bottom line, the tours were great, and everyone was waiting for us at the times arranged. Next year we hope to do Greece and will use TSC to help us arrange that as well.

Two friends and I had a whirlwind 3 day trip to beautiful Istanbul at the end of September 2016 and we were lucky enough to find Zeki to be our guide!We'd been a bit naughty sampling the nightlife of the city so we didn't start our exploration of the main sites until around midday, oops ;p But our main stop was the insanely beautiful Hagia Sophia and I can't imagine enjoying our time there more with anyone else. From before even entering, Zeki pointed out the much older ancient ruins of the very first basilica at the foundations of the Hagia Sophia which I'm sure we would have walked straight past had we been alone. This this attention to detail was obvious throughout our whole tour of this incredible place and you can really feel that Zeki has real passion and deep knowledge. I've had many tour guides in the past (I'm a history buff and general travel lover!) but I truly felt so immersed in the fascinating history of this place - even being shown the worn down marble slabs at the main entrance door caused by hundreds of years of wear by the Byzantine guards who once stood on them. So cool!!The whole experience was a blast & Zeki is genuinely the sweetest, friendliest and most knowledgeable guy you could ever hope to meet - he even recommended an evening Dinner Cruise on the Bosphorus which was also amazing (Orient Bosphorus Dinner Cruise - look it up!) - and I will be sure to call on him for our next Istanbul trip....I have plenty more I want to see!

As we did like it, we decided to do that again, and we looked for one here on Trip Advisor. We picked out Zeki as we could have chosen any other, as the reviews of others were as good as well. We couldn't be any lucker! Zeki was not only a tour guide doing his job. He was someone in love with his own work, committed, and his professionalism was shown at the very first contact. He answered right away on our first contact, rapidly answered all our questions, offered shuttles and anything else we might need on our stay in Istambul. We spent two days with him, and he showed a lot of experience and knowledge in history. He set a schedule that was just perfect for us, traveling with a child that might be annoyed by the tour, but she also loved him. His English is perfect and he is also kind and very outgoing. He took us to cozy local restaurants, and we even had the opportunity to go to an authentic Turkish Hamman (Turkish Bath). We had a very good cruise tour on Bosphorous, where he explained all the important spots, and had a delicious Turkish Tea!He helped us doing some shopping in the Grand Bazaar, told us about the tradition of bargaining in Turkey, and was concerned with us all of the time. We showed interest in going to Cappadocia, and he set everything for us, and that was just perfect! He set shuttle from the hotel to the airport, the airline tickets, the shuttle there, a cozy boutique hotel just up on the hills of Cappadocia with the best view ever, an excellent ballon company (we had an unforgettable ballon tour - amazing!), and shuttle back to Istambul as well. In Cappacocia he also included a tour with a local private tour guide that was as competent as he is. We visited all the important spots there! We couldn't imagine that to be better!I mean, all the partners he indicated us were as responsible as he is.And during all the stay in Cappadocia he kept in contact with us, asking if everything was ok.We are experienced travelers, we have more than 20 international trips (and we are not in the 40's yet!), and this time we are coming back home really satisfied!In addition, I would like to say that we really saved money in having Zeki with us.When we travel by ourselves, as we did many times before, we spend much more money in looking at the maps, looking for the best places to go, and sometimes when you are on vacation, you don't have the time to do that and visit everything you would like to. And plus, you spend more money going to the wrong placesI would recommend him to all travelers coming to Istambul. He is a professional tour guide who loves what he does. And that really made a difference!Thank you, very much Zeki! Kind regards from Jos\u00e9 Roberto, Gisele e Beatriz!"

As a second visit, we were looking at doing some different things. He obliged.One of our party was sporting a leg injury - Zeki was caring and judicious in selection of paths, stairs and destinations. He kept the pace manageable and offered a ready arm. A great 2 days with him leading us through the sites and managing entrance and so on. Guides cut ticket queues and know where to go and when to maximise attraction time and minimise crowds.

This was our first trip to Turkey and we had some concerns about safety, culture etc. We found Zeki on tripadvisor and contacted him. We had many email exchanges and Zeki was always very patient, prompt and great to communicate with. The email exchanges made us feel very comfortable with him and he was also more affordable. So we decided to hire Zeki. From the minute we met him we felt that we had met a long lost friend. Both our teens and my wife and me felt very comfortable with Zeki from the get go. We toured all of Istanbul with him for 2 days in which he covered all the major sight seeing places. We all had such a great time, that Zeki went above and beyond and spent more time than he had originally planned for. We also made changes to our itinerary and Zeki was very flexible and was able to quickly accommodate our changes and come up with a new plan. He is very knowledgeable and can make quick decisions which helped us maximize our time with him. He is also a very fast walker!In addition, we had a special occasion to celebrate and Zeki helped make reservations for us at Reina where we spent a wonderful evening as a family. He always gave us the right advise, helped us order our meals when he was with us and even helped plan the days we were without him. We also realized that we have over paid Zeki on the last day and contacted him. He promptly came back the next morning and refunded the money. He was very fair and trustworthy!With Zeki, our trip was memorable and we would love to go to Istanbul again and also love to hire him during our next trip. Istanbul was indeed a fun city and we miss it very much.Zeki is a small town boy full of dreams. We wish you all the very best and pray for your success and happiness. You took such good care of us and you were like a brother and a family member to all of us. Your patience, simplicity, fairness, laid back and positive attitude touched us and we are very happy to have found you through trip advisor (thank you trip advisor!). Would always love to stay in touch with you. God bless!"

The guide books helped us only a bit. Most of the locals only spoke in turkish and we had a hard time understanding what they were trying to communicate. But then when we decided to go to Hagia Sophia, this man was standing at the entrance and asked do we needed a tour guide. At first we hesitated not knowing the price to ask for or would we be comfortable with him. But then we gave it a shot and it was the best decision we took!  Zeki made our trip memorable with his charm and with his humble nature, oohh and also his jokes. He is a funny guy! He took us to all the sightseeing places and being a vegetarian and an Indian in the heart of Istanbul we had a problem with our lunch! But no worries since Zeki was there and he knew Indian restaurants too. He was helpful throughout our trip! And also the night boat tour which he took us to was amazing. I always wanted to see Istanbul at night and just enjoy it's stillness from the boat and Zeki here just made my wish come true!

He will either take charge and run the show or let you tell him what pace and direction you want to take then keep up. Our situation was unique in that I caught a stomach bug from my son evidently the day before we left but it didn't hit me until the night before the tour. I tried to tough it out but ended up passing out at the first top of the day, the Hagia Sofia. Zeki rushed to by me some juice and the cafe while I was laying on a rock table as old as the Hagia. Needless to say it was a bit embarrassing with thousands of tourists looking on, but Zeki handled it with care and got us back to our room immediately. He offered to take us to the hospital, etc. but we knew it only required a bit of rest. The only thing we'd paid him was the deposit, and he had already exceeded that in expenses for the tour (he pays for the entrance fees, cabs, etc. and you pay him at the end) He just told us to call him over the next couple of days to start where we left off. We did just that the following day and had a wonderful full day with Zeki. We usually don't use tour guides, and especially not group tours, but we would not hesitate to use or recommend Zeki to anyone."

My family and I spent a day with Zeki Ciftici like no other, he took us to many of the most impressing sights in Istanbul, without the hassle of standing in queues and buying our own tickets we saved so much time and used that time to see more sights. We went to Topkapi palace, Hagia Sophia and many others. We really did learn a lot about the Turkish pearl, Istanbul, from this professional guide... Many thanks Zeki for making our trip very particularly remarkable."

With his good English and official government accreditation, we engaged him to guide us through this museum and the Basilica Cistern that day. Next day he guided us through Topkapi Palace and the Blue Mosque. Through our hours with Zeki, he was friendly, very knowledgeable and patient with all of our questions. He went far out of his way to help us with banks and even to send a parcel of souvenirs home to Australia. Further, he organised a private transfer and guide for our visit to the Gallipoli Peninsula. We were very impressed with his affable professional manner; he increased our knowledge, appreciation and enjoyment of this part of Turkey by 1000%. Most highly recommended!"

            "review": "Fantastic Guide!. I was traveling alone and only had one day in Istanbul to see the sites and completely lucked out running into Zeki first thing that morning in front of Hagia Sophia Museum. I hadn't planned on hiring a guide but it turned out to be the best thing I did that day. Since I only had one full day and wanted to hit as many major sites as I could, Zeki accommodated my timetable and interests perfectly. Not having to wait in lines for tickets is standard with all official guides, but I'm pretty sure Zeki whisked me inside the blue mosque a little ahead of other tour groups. As well, and this is the best part, he took a real interest in what I found interesting and tailored each site tour to my tastes. You can easily spend an entire day at the palace, but he gave me a run down of what we could see there and gave me the option to nix whatever parts I didn't want to spend time exploring. Oh, and during that palace visit when he was explaining that tulips originated in that region (April would be a great time to see the palace in full bloom) and I lamented that I would have loved some bulbs but knew we were out of season, he took me to a tiny gardening shop and had the owner climb up into the attic and retrieve some bulbs for me to take home! There is no way, and I mean absolutely no way, that would have happened without Zeki. He was very thoughtful and just a pleasure to be around. And he is well-traveled enough himself that we never ran out of things to talk about. Zeki is a fountain of knowledge and his English is perfect (I believe he speaks German, Spanish and French as well). I would recommend him as a personal guide without hesitation!!"

Unlike other tour guides, they did not charge us on anything like snow chains, umberellas, sea transportation for van, change of route, diesel or extra luggage. The driver even gave us Baklava on our last day with him as a gift to remember. Next time, we are 100% confident we will use the same company for our transportation needs in Istanbul.

Me and my wife were on our honeymoon last month, and they organised the whole tour for us, it was an 11 days tour and there is a lot to talk about which i don't think ill be able to write but ill just write the highlights hereOut tour was organised by Aysun. She has been very helpful throughout and was always available whenever we needed her. She surely made sure that our trip be memorable enough. Our tour was designed in a way that most of our expense was already included because here in turkey if you try doing these things yourself you might end up spending three times may be. All our tour guides were good, but there was this guy Ali battir who was hard to go unnoticed. An amazing guy with the passion of what he does, not only that he knows how to make a trip memorable for his guest. Although its a very tough job to go out in the same place daily and still manage to create that awe for the tourists who sre probable coming here the first time. He tries to give them the correct flavor. We went to the red and green tou with him which was amazing. His style of explaining and his devotion for the work is unmatched.There is a lot i might have missed in the writing but it at leastwh sums up how it all went"

We were so impressed with this company that we recommended them to two other families we met whilst in Turkey and they were all singing their praises. Well Done Team Insider Travel Turkey!!

Our guide Ali spoke good English, was well versed with historical facts and had a delightful sense of humour. The driver Hazrat was also very obliging. At the end of the day tour, they went out of their way and took us to a shop to buy local specialities. We were so satisfied with the Green tour that the next day we booked ourselves on the Red tour."

Originally I booked with insider tours as I was lost in cappadocia looking for my hotel when I was rescued by driver Haznet, I came too the office the next morning and booked my trip last minute and I am so glad I did, the green tour was amazing you are taken through the south of the area and visit the underground city, see the fairy chimneys and the monastry, plus a fantastic lunch. I think what made the tour extra special was guide Ali, driver Haznet and the people on the tour. I'm a solo traveller and have never been part of such a great mixed group. I decided I wanted to stay so extra day which the office did for me including rebooking my coach ticket and I booked the red tour for the next day. I was delighted when I arrived and 6 members of the group had done the same. We saw a completely different side of Cappadocia and I would urge anyone visiting to do both!!! Ali was the tour guide again but this time Manager Mr Ergin as the driver. Insider travel also looked after my luggage after I checked out as the hotel couldn't and after our tour me and 4 others the use of their office before our coach came offering us beverages and traditionally cooked potatoes. Hospitality at its finest. Thank you to everyone at insider travel for making this trip so memorable and special including the office ladies yiblit and minewer!!!!!"

We didn't face any difficulty or problem. All staff, specially our tour guide 'Ali Battir' and his driver Hazrat had been extremely friendly, knowledgable and cooperative persons. Their behavior, knowledge and help made our tour a real success. We stayed six days in Turkey and enjoyed every minute spent there."

He is very professional, enterprising and has amazing knowledge regarding each and every place we visited. Also has decent knowledge regarding most of the countries & thus could engage all the tourists talking about their respective countries. My camera charger was not functional. Ali went out of his way in guiding me in getting hold of a charger within no time. Takes pride in describing the culture and heritage of Cappadocia. Insider travels had arranged for decent meals during our tours on both the days. Also arranged hot air ballooning at a good price. Highly recommended for tourists visiting Cappadocia."

Especially the Bosphorus tour, Princess Island and the Turkish night was amazing. No promiss was broken! Later we booked a trip to Cappadocia. Mr Savash did an professional job co-ordinating this great tour, good accomodation, very good fabulous guides- all speaking very good english. Many thanks to our tour guide Ali. He knows what to do!!

We did so, to no account.Long story short, we went to confront the agent, a tall, asian-looking guy named Hamid or something like that. He accidentally let it slipped that the hotel told him we where staying one more night, so he changed our tour date without our concent. Which you cannot do. Refund was clearly out of the table - this guys are mercenaries: you can take what they offer or nothing at all. He event though it fit to demonstrate his kicking abilities when he felt intimidated. Not kidding. He speaks English very well, and talks to no end so as to confuse custumers.And of course we did not fly in the first group so we missed the sunrise.Talking with some other, more serious travel agent, we were told this guys owe money to half Turkey.Save yourself trouble - go elsewhereDisclaimer: the present review is only for the company Insider, not the Company that actually provided our Hot Air Balloon Tour - Skyways Balloon.

My flight wasn't scheduled to leave until 23:00, but I didn't review the itinerary before booking so my fault. The return flight to Istanbul was delayed about 30 minutes. By the time I exited the airport it was 01:00 or so and there was no one to pick me up for the transfer to my hotel. I was so tired I jumped in a cab. Mr. Savas Aral from Insider Travel told me after I returned home that the driver waited 30 min. only then was advised to leave the airport without me. They obviously didn't check the flight arrival time. I wouldn't book again with this company for that reason.I did the Red Tour the first day with a really knowledgeable tour guide and a small group of about 15 people. Very enjoyable. I don't remember the guide's name but he isn't an employee of I.T. The second day was the Green Tour which involves more walking and an Underground City. I ended up in a big bus with over 30 people which was way too many people for the Green Tour. I.T. advertises small groups of 15 people. False advertising.The Mystic Cave Hotel is so so. My toilet stopped working the morning I was leaving and it took over 10 minutes with the water running to get a hot shower.You get what you pay for!"

My son was made extremely welcome and everyone was particularly nice to him. Turkey is a great place for kids, and Insider is a great travel agency. I recommend them."

She was shouting at the group to move at EVERY single stop, so she obviously didn't realize the main point for tourists with these tours is usually first to enjoy the landscapes and the atmosphere of the places, really tune into the surroundings, and just then hear about the facts, history and interesting details. Everything she told was pretty much the stuff u could guess on your own anyway (\"this is a kitchen and this used to be an oven/fridge/fire place\" or \"guess what this is - oh it is a well/air vent, guess what they did with them\") and her whole point seemed to be just to run through all the places forcing people to listen to her and then rush everyone out. And yes, the tour ended up in a jewelry store where we had the most time to hang out then in any of the other places - BLAH!Only good thing was that the stops were all amazing. But since exactly the same green tour is offered by all the other tour agencies in G\u00f6reme, I would definitely advise everyone to use them, not this one."

But the one in green tour spoke a bit too fast, and the tour is bit too packed somehow. I hope the shopping part could be minimized in the green tour if possible... So that we could have a longer time spent in the ilhara valley.But anyways, Insider Travel staff are all very friendly.P.s. recommend the Turkish night, the belly dance in the finale is fabulous!! We spent a wonderful night there! (Well.. just don't expect too much about the food in the Turkish night..)"

The hotel \" mystic cave hotel\" run by this company is of reasonable price (we stayed in 6bed dorm),very convenient location and clean. Part of the tours bring you to shops,which make the trip a little bit hasty(the southern tour has longer driving time, thus shorter time for the sights), we don't mind shop a little to help out the quiet business in winter time, but can improve in arrangements of time. All in all, their trip is enjoyable and tour guides knowledgeable to the history n background of Cappadocia."

They went the extra mile to help me out and assist in anyway they could. Alper was a very good tour guide, really intelligent and carries a good vibe with him. I definitely recommend the red tour. The food is definitely a bonus on that tour. As for the office. Extremely helpful.

He avoided questions and had hardly any knowledge on any of the places we visited. He seemed to hardly care about anything and spent more time talking to other tour guides and chatting up the female tour guides than explaining anything or engaging us in any sort of conversation about the places we were at. We would be waiting to get into something and he would just stand there ignoring everyone and talking to other tour guides! Even if I asked a question he would blow me off. I am very interested in history, particularly early Anatolian history, so I was incredibly disappointed. We rushed through the underground city, which was the coolest place, but then spent ages at a JEWELLERY SHOP! I am incredibly disappointed and I do not recommend. Insider Tours, educate your guides on the regions and places they're discussing, and also on how to respond to questions! If he didn't know the answer to a simple question, he would just make something up. On a lighter note, lunch was nice and the places visited were too."

The tourist sites were not nearly important as my relations with the people and culture. You can't find better people than Muset (manager) and Keyvah who work at their Istanbul office. They both speak English very well. These guys will take care of you, and if a problem arises they will make it right. Prices were the same range as what we had found online. In other words you were paying the same as if we arranged it ourselves. Traveling in Turkey can be a bit crazy. Unless you speak Turkish you really put your trust in the people who make the arrangements. We took a bus to Cappadocia and the transfers were pretty exciting to say the least. Insider made sure there were people there who got us from one bus to another. The shuttles got us to Goreme and back without a problem or hassle. They arranged balloon fights were were wonderful. They arranged our bus to Cappadocia region, Goreme which went smoothly. They arranged a Bosphorus Cruise who had a wonderful tour guide who put up with me asking him 1000 questions about Turkey. You actually just ride on a ferry boat and you pay a bit extra for the English speaking tour guide. You also stop off at a mosque and Spice market during the tour. The first day of our balloon trip there was a mechanical problem with our balloon. I was very pleased that they chose the side of safety and decided not to fly that balloon. We were given the choice flying 1/2 hour later or wait till the next day. We waited for the next days flight which was wonderful.  Muset from Insider found out about the problem and gave us a call at our Hotel in Goreme to check up on us and make sure we were rescheduled. That is the kind of service he delivers. Take the time to accept his tea which he will offer and take the time to get to get to know him and Keyvah. Wonderful people. Something to consider. If we were to do it again, I would fly to Cappadocia region. Because we chose a night bus we had to arrange late check outs from the hotel and killing some time before the bus left in the evening. Also you arrive in the morning before check in. (Adora, Grand Cave Suites and Anemon were all great in accommodating us). From experience, talking,and reading, bus rides in Turkey are a bit hit or miss. Sometimes they are great experiences, other times not much air conditioning, frequent stops with lights coming on. Or, If I had the time I might take a day bus just so I could see the country side as we traveled overnight."

He gave us little information and just left us with a meeting time at each point (he didn't not walk around with the group and talk about things, he only gave a snippet of info before releasing us). Even a novice traveler or a tourist could easily have gone to the places independently and saved 35 Euro. The worst part of the tour was at the end when we stopped for \"shopping\" at a leather shop. We were walked in and had to endure a mini-fashion show, then walked through the store. Only 1 person of our group stopped to buy anything. Had we understood this as the last stop, we would have left the group at the previous stop and not wasted our time. I don't know what their other tours are like, but I wouldn't recommend this one- perhaps, it was just our guide. I don't even remember his name as the tour was so un-tour like."

Kadir was our contact at the office and he was so incredibly helpful (Thank you, Kadir!!!). He set up fantastic tours, fixed a miscommunication we had with one of the balloon companies, arranged transportation or drove us himself, was very kind and professional and was always available with either a quick phone call or a stop by the office if we needed him. We did the North tour with Deniz, the South tour with Tugba, Turkish Night, the Whirling Dervish Ceremony and the Balloon Ride. They were all phenomenal experiences and if you have the time, I highly recommend doing them all. If you have to choose only a few, you must do the North and South tours and the balloon ride...WOW!!!Everyone we met through Insider Travel was very knowledgeable, helpful and fun. The prices for everything were very reasonable. Insider Travel will definitely make sure you have a great time during your stay in Cappadocia!"

However, what we experienced with Insider travel was simply terrible. The driver hit on my sister and tried to lie down on her when we were sitting on floor cushions in a restaurant. We then told the manger who promised he would take care of the situation and we would not have the same driver on the second day. Low and behold on day two we had the same driver. At the end of the tour we talked again to the manager who said that he asked the driver what happened and the driver said nothing ever did. I would not recommend this tour company to anyone as there are plenty of others in the area with a better track record."

Ozcan never informed us that the cable car is not working and when I complained to him about part of the tour, he pretends he cannot hear me from the phone. He charged people differently for the same tour. So do not use them.The tour itself is a disaster. The driver constantly switches lane., drives very fast and at the same time talk on the Mobile phone. Although the tour does include lunch you might as well not. As the food is horrible. The food in McDonalds (which I normally do not like) is better than what this tour have provided. The meat is like donor kebab meat but dry. One of the stop that they drop us to - mount Olympus / uldag has no views full of rubbish and cars. Yet we need to stay here for an hour doing nothing. When we complained to the guide he was not helpful but just say I am doing what the brochure tells me. I am not sure he is insterested in his job. As after we complaint his attitude change completely. He did not take us to the olives market as according to the bronchure. When he takes us to see a very old tree I asked him what is So special his answer was you go and see it yourself. When he drops us off he did not even bother to come down from the car to say goodbye or help!!!! How unprofessional. His English is not good enough to be a guide as very often when we asked him question he does not understand!!!!"

We arranged to travel on an all day trip taking in the following: Dolmabaha\u00e7e Palace, Spice Market, Lunch beneath Galata Bridge, Cable Car @ Piere Loti Hill and Bosphorus by Boat.Collection at our hotel meant a 5 minute walk to the minibus as stopping outside our hotel was a bit of a no no. Our first port of call having traipsed round Istanbul collecting various passengers was the Dolmabaha\u00e7e Palace. It is a vast place with many interesting artefacts and decorations, the rooms are overlarge and very ornate (If visiting independently, you will require a guide) It took well over an hour to traverse all the rooms that are open to the public and there are several renovations in progress. It is something not to be missed on a visit to Istanbul.The Spice Market was our next port of call and we were given about 50 minutes to look round and purchase anything we liked. Having met up with most of our fellow travellers (two went walkabouts) we walked to the restaurant under the Galata Bridge. We were given a \"mese\" starter and offered fish or chicken for main course finishing with fresh fruit. It was what one would normally expect on such a trip. Whilst lunching we were able to observe the comings and goings on the Golden Horn not forgetting the many fishing lines from the bridge of locals catching their supper.Having located our miscreants we made our way to the bus and headed to the Piere Loti Hill, which afforded spectacular views of the inlet. Returning to road level we headed for our final port of call, the boat ride up the Bosphorus. We caught on of the many ferries that ply their trade along this route. It was a pleasurable way to spend an hour and a half cruising between Europe and Asia. (Note: wrap up warm as the wind can knock the temperature down many a notch).The whole day was an excellent way to spend our last full day in Istanbul. Our Guide for the day was most knowledgeable and had a very good command of the English language. He never stopped imparting information as to our surroundings.Although pricey, it was well worth the money as we had a wonderful day out. Thank you Fuad."

We were a group of two families total of four adults , four kids, and three infants, we had spent three days in Istanbul visiting museums on our own, it was ok since most have the audio guide which was really helpful, the kids were tiered from walking around historical sights so we decided to take a tour to bursa for a change, that's when we were deceived by the insider travel into paying 90 euros per person which we were told would include the transportation, lunch and a cable car trip to the top of uludag, and visiting an ottoman mosque and tomb. We were told that the trip there is around three hours total,We booked our trip a day before ( which was the last day of the holy festival, bayram) , we were told that they would pick us up on 8:15 am, but they arrived 7:30am and were rushing us, you can imagine how things are in the morning with kids, we were at the bus 7:50 am , we were taken to a gathering point where we waited 30 min , that's when our tour guide started saying that they might skip the cable car ride because of the weather ( which actually seemed ok) , on the way there we stopped at a Turkish delights shop for half an hour, then in a so called shopping mall for over an hour, nothing special in either. By then the kids started getting fed up with the trip, we arrived at bursa after the guide claimed he got a phone call from X saying the cable cars were closed and that we were visiting an old tree instead , we asked our guide to take us to the cable car station but he refused, we spent 30 min watching a very big tree, we then arrived at the area were the restaurant , the mosque and the tomb are, we were givin an hour and 20 min free time ( no guide) for lunch and visiting the sights, by then it was 3:35 pm. We had lunch at the restaurant where we asked for a table with a view and they refused, claiming that it was the agency that reserved the tables, the kids had to wash, then we had about 15 min left to visit the mosque and the tomb, not enough to take pics , we rushed to the bus, that's when we were told that since its the last day of the festival the roads will be crowded, and it really were we arrived back at the hotel 11:40 pm .we spent ten hours on the bus and we weren't givin enough time to see bursa not even the uludag mountain. The whole group thought It was a total waste of money and more important time. No one was satisfied at all.The next day we complained to the agency they were very rude and unprofessional handling our complain, they were not even willing to apologise verbally . I don't recommend this agency at all."

The Insider Tour representative walked us from the Bus Station to the Insider Tours office adjacent to the station. The tour bus was yet to arrive, and so the tour guide very thoughtfully drove us to our hotel in his own car! Our tour (Green Tour) started on time and the Tour Guide was very pleasant. Though a lot of us were tired from the overnight bus ride into Cappadocia, the guide was very energetic and took the pains to explain the tour and account for relaxation time. The tour of the underground cave city was simply superb and is a must try experience!The valley walk was nice, but not necessarily unique - so was a little tiring. The food was a bit of a problem as we were vegetarian and the fare was edible at best. However, the guide was very kind to notice that we weren't enjoying our meal and offered to have sandwiches made for us. Through the tour the guide was friendly and regularly enquired about our experience.We were very tired at the end of the tour on day-1 and hence wanted to pull-out of the tour on day-2 (Red Tour), as we had a balloon tour in the morning as well. We informed Insider Tour in the evening and the response was cordial and understanding. In fact, he voluntarily returned the tour fee (and its not often that travel agents act so professionally). The balloon tour, also organised by Insider was excellent, through rainbow balloons. The balloon ride started early in the morning at 5am and we had some sandwiches and tea at the Rainbow balloons office. Once the balloon was ready, we were taken to the site to board the balloon. The ride lasted about an hour and we had an experienced pilot. The ride was capped off with a champagne party upon landing (and a perfect one at that). We thoroughly enjoyed the ride.Overall, in our brief visit to Turkey, we rate Insider as one of the best operators that we saw in the country."

We were lucky enough to have him for both tours. His English is great and was extremely personable and explained everything incredibly well. He mixed history, stories, and humor throughout both days making us wish the tour would never end. Request Asim and you will not be disappointed!!Insider Travel as a whole seemed extremely professional and truly catered to everyone's needs.

My children asked me to translate to them which I really tried to avoid .Most of the Arab tourists did not enjoy the trip not because only the unavailable Arabic translator but also the unnecessary stops we made plus the horrible lunch provided to us . I decided to leave the agency in cable car because they did not provide the second stop in the cable car which is the most beautiful and came back to Istanbul by taxi which I paid from my money. Next day I went to the agency to complain and I met the representative who spoke to his manager whose name is Ozcan. This manager was trying to convince that this condition is not written , so I realized from the beginning that he is not a problem solving . I had my witness when the representative assured me with my condition. Ozcan shouted at me and asked me to get out of his office !!!!! A clue of a good service. I decided to complain to the Turkish tourism office but my witness managed the situation with the agency and the offered me a free trip inside Istanbul. Although the situation somehow managed not by Ozcan , I really do not recommend this agency not only because of the bad service but also because of the bad attitude of the manager Ozcan."

Before we ever got to Turkey every detail was planned, organized, and communicated to me by Emre. I knew every flight we would be taking, every hotel we would stay at (and hotel website so I could check them out in advance), historical sites we would be visiting, as well as, various side activities to consider. In addition, Emre listened to and responded to ALL my questions/concerns about travel in Turkey. One of the best things about Emre is his initiative--he takes his job very seriously and wants to make sure that his client's expectations are met. He finds out what your interests are so that he can personalize the travel experience as much as possible. In my case, I love cooking so Emre set up a morning of preparing a tandoori lunch with a lovely and amazing local woman in her home. That experience was just one of the highlights of the trip (and, the food was beyond delicious--one of the best of my life!) Emre is very organized yet flexible if tell him you would like to make a change in the days activities. Emre is a personable and open guy--very easy to talk to. He wants you to know about Turkish history and how all the pieces fit together. He clearly loves his job and his country. Lastly, we always felt absolutely safe with Emre and his drivers. Everyone we met through Emre was professional, kind, well spoken and competent. I give Emre my highest recommendation."

We had an amazing time in Turkey touring Pamukale, Kusadasi, Ephesus and Istanbul. yes all that in just tow days. I must say it would not have been possible with our the expertise of our guide Emre.He is simply incredible, very professional and phenomenal in managing all our requests for the various sites with our limited time.We not just saw the sites but also enjoyed his company as he is very friendly and spoke very fluent English. Right from the moment I had send him my first inquiry email to the last moment, when he dropped us off to the airport, he was very patient, helpful and everything happened smoothly. His guidance was simply amazing. The transportation, entrance fees, hotels- everything was very well organized and of top quality.We were warmly received at the Izmir airport by him and his associate( an amazing person also) , and then we set off on our amazing tour of Pamukalee and all the interesting smaller cities that were on the way. Emre told us interesting facts and details of cities like Nazili, Atca, Aydan and more. Pamukale and the ruins of Hierapolisi were very marvelous. Definitely worth the long drive. The sunset over the pools of Pamukale was amazing and sunrise on the shores of the Kusadasi was breathtaking. Another highlight of our tour was Ephesus. Fascinating history and Incredible town planning from thousands of years ago. So much can be said about the city of Istanbul. The magnificent architecture, tiles and art work of the Blue Mosque, Aya Sofia and the Topkapi palace are beyond description.Emre has a genuine passion for history which makes him very knowledgeable and made the entire tour very interesting and educational for us. Looking at the beautiful scenery and sites is one thing, but knowing the history behind them makes it all the more fascinating and interesting.We concluded our incredible tour of Turkey with the show of the mesmerizing Twirling Dervish. We had an unbelievable time. I just have to go back for another tour as there is still so much to see in Turkey and there is no doubt that Emre will be our guide. His pleasant company added to make our trip so awesome.He was truly a great reflection of Turkish hospitality and culture, I will definitely recommend him."

He helped plan our itinerary, recommended hotels, internal flights and restaurants. He accommodated our preference to walk a lot (as opposed to sitting in a car all the time). He is knowledgeable about history, Islam, local sites, flora, and fauna. He answered our endless questions skillfully and patiently. He planned a pace that was busy but left time to shop or take photos. We saw all the key sites but had extras as well: a river trip on the Bosphorus, a multi-course lunch with wine tastings at a vineyard in Ephesus, cooking with a local woman in Cappadocia. He met my special request to visit a clinic and school. We also did a great hike in Cappadocia. He also accommodated us in other ways, for example, we did not want to have a big lunch and dinner every day so he found quick and tasty places to have a light lunch many days. I would highly recommend him."

Finally we got first class vehicles in both cities, baby seats were OK and we even got a Van with WIFI.

My parents and I booked a private day tour with Nesrin as our guide as my father uses a wheelchair and conventional tours do not work logistically for us. We arrived via cruise ship to Kusadasi port and called Nesrin as we were early. She happily accommodated our time change and we easily met up. We had all been to the more typical Kusadasi stuff a couple times before, Ephasus, the house of Mary, a rug factory, etc. so we arranged with Nesrin something more unique and different. Nesrin is a sweetheart - knowledgeable and passionate about her country. Our driver was friendly and extremely helpful, we enjoyed getting to know him. Both spoke great English! The vehicle was clean, comfortable, and easily accommodated the wheelchair. Nesrin took us first to the Basilica of St. John, where she gave us an excellent historical overview if the evolution of Ephasus and Selcek. Then, we went to the Ephasus museum - witch was fabulous and very well done. I wish I had know about it the last time I visited. Nesrin guided us in the museum and made sure we understood the importance of many of the pieces. Afterward. I mentioned that I loved Turkish pottery, so she brought us to a lovely place where they hand make the most intricately beautiful pottery where we received a private demonstration of pottery throwing and painting. Lastly, we visited a wonderful winery where we had a beautiful outdoor patio to eat on overlooking the rows of grapes. We invited our driver and Nesrin to join us and thoroughly enjoyed the conversation! Overall, our tour was one of the better experiences we've ever had travelling. It was well planned, yet flexible and accommodating. I could not have asked for more, it was also quite affordable. I highly recommend!"

After reading lots of reviews we were fortunate to find and decide to hire Nesrin for our tour of Ephesus and the other wonders in that area. And we hired Emre for two days of guiding in Istanbul. Both Nesrin and Emre are amazing historians as well as understand how to allow you to pace yourself from place to place. Emre suggested using a car service for our time together in Istanbul and that turned out to be a great idea. The comfort of having a car there when you were ready to move on and also to be able to leave jackets and umbrellas and water was a great comfort. We visited so many major sites in two days as well as had some wonder meals together. His knowledge as an historian was just as everyone has described. And his personality is such that you want to leave the tour knowing he will be an acquaintance for life!Nesrin greated us at our hotel the day of our tour but also called us upon our arrival in Kusadasi to make sure we were settled and happy in our hotel. We met her for our tour of Ephesus and Sirince Village for lunch as well as Virgin Mary's house and St., John Basilica. The day was amazing and we had Mithat, her driver with us to help make our day complete.Nesrin arrange for us to be with Mithat the following day and we went to a Haman and then to a winery outside of Kusadasi. It was a special place with great wine and a wonderful meal; one of the best we had in Turkey! And Turkey has amazing food. I cannot recommend this couple enough and we are already thinking about our next trip so we can book them for Capadocia and more of the Aegean coast. They are busy so don't waste more time seaching and try to book them for your needs. I will recommend that both in Istanbul as well as in Ezmir, you utilize the taxi services to settle you in your hotel and save the money to use Emre's and Nesrin's drivers the day of your tours. Their vehicles are very comfortble and it's great to be able to talk with them while moving around. The savings is great and there are good taxi's in Turkey if you are going to a known hotel or have directions written in the Turkish language to pass the driver at the airports. The hotel can get your back to the airport in a taxi as well."

I had arrived in Istanbul alone, and because of Nesrin\u2019s thorough insider knowledge of the city, I was able to see the passages and nooks and crannies which I wouldn\u2019t have found in otherwise.

My mother-daughter trip was made better not only because of Nesrin's flexibility and knowledge, but it was lovely to have a friend for the day. She's personable, kind, and very intelligent. I highly recommend this tour team, as they are great guides and great people. Will be sure to keep their contact information for future adventures! Thanks, Nesrin and Emre for taking care of my family!"

They both have excellent English and are both easy and fun to be with. We learned so much about the history of Turkey! Their knowledge was amazing! We had lunch at a beautiful Ottoman restaurant with a wonderful outdoor patio. We went to the bazaar and to the spice market where they helped us find all the treasures we were looking for. We stopped to rest our feet and had Turkish coffee and baklava in the afternoon. Each day lasted until 5:30 and we were so pleased with our experience. It could not have been any better. I will treasure the memory of being in Istanbul forever thanks to these two warm, friendly, and professional guides."

            "review": "Delightful Istanbul Tour. On May 2, 2015 we, six Canadians, contracted Nesrin for the 7 hour Istanbul Waking Tour. Nesrin is the most passionate professional guide we ever met. She speaks excellent English and delivers very well a nice presentation of the history of her country and particularly its historic sites. From our meeting time at cruise ship, 8:30 AM, she quickly enquired particular interest of everyone in the group as she spent time with each person while travelling to the main attractions.We walked about five minutes from the ship to the nearly tram station for the 15 minutes tram ride. We found ourselves in the middle of most important history sites of Istanbul: the Hippodrome, Blue Mosque, Topkapi Palace, Hagia Sophia, Underground Cistern and finally the Grand Bazaar. Except for the Blue Mosque all other sites were entered on a fast track system. She prepared us before entering a site and provided more information once in. While lines up existed in certain rooms of the compound she would make an effort to seek permission to cut lines with success in most situations. We had lunch with her at an excellent restaurant she recommended. Prices were reasonable on the terrace overlooking the city and the river from the roof of a hotel. She gave us more than the seven hours stated in the contract as she said goodbye past 5:00 PM. On our behalf, she also took care of all the transportation costs and entry fees at all venues. Back on the cruise we compared notes with others that bought similar tour from the ship. We found that, being a small group, we received far more benefits from Nesrin than those from the ship for half the price. We saw far more exhibits mainly because we walked from one venue to the other, while a large bus was used for the ship tour."

She arranged lunch in an excellent restaurant frequented by locals. She has a wonderful command of English. Nesrin responded appropriately to all questions.

Our family of four spent two weeks in July in Turkey under the able guidance of Emre Ozkara and his colleague Seraat, who did an outstanding job of driving us across Turkey between Cappadochia and the West coast. It was clearly one of the best vacations we have had. Turkey is inherently a beautiful country with rich history and at the cross roads between the East and the West. There is so much to see and experience, it is easy to get overwhelmed and lost.Emre did a great job helping us with our planning, itinerary design and focused our limited time on some of the best examples of Turkish culture - history, nature, people, arts and craft, life, cuisine etc. The breadth and depth of his knowledge of local history, the archaeology, sights and scenes was impressive and very educational. It makes our pictures more meaningful to look at long after departing Turkey.He took us beyond the beaten path to get us closer to the genuine local people, places, practices and helped us interact by being a patient translator. Among our highlights were some sumptuous traditional lunches at some small family run restaurants in far flung places. We fondly remember the people, faces and the wonderful dishes.During our planning phase he helped us choose some of the best Hotels to suit our taste and price points. He was always pleasant and patient to work with, remotely from the US before we finally met him in Istanbul to start our tour. I would highly recommend Emre and his team for those who want a very personalized experience and high quality service during their visit to Turkey.

In our case we knew that during the evening hours it would be closed, but that should not stop anyone from going. Both the Hagia Sophia and the Blue Mosque were spectacular and lit beautifully at night. Emre was profoundly knowledgeable and his English is terrific. After touring we went for dinner on Kumkapi Street: a fantastic street filled with restaurants and musicians. Very popular with locals. The fresh fish was AMAZING. The starters were also delicious. After dinner we returned to the airport all with enough time to catch our flight. We felt badly for all those people who spent the entire layover at the airport. We actually felt energized by the entire experience (even with having been on the first flight for almost 13 hours) We loved our mini excursion to Istanbul and know that we would be delighted to return.

As a History Teacher I had specific interest such as the walls of Constantinople and fortresses of Istanbul that many tours leave out or rush you through in record time. Emre drove my wife and I around Istanbul and we even drove past Taksim Square with no difficulties. He narrated as he drove pointing out all sight of significance and answered all of our questions. We never felt rushed at a sight and we were encouraged to take our time and really spend some time at each site. We went to many places such as a tour of multiple sections of the Walls, Yedikule Dungeons, Rumeli Fortress, Kucuksu Palace and lunch at a small non-tourist restaurant on the Asia side. This customized tour was the best day we spent in Instanbul and we enjoyed every day! We toured many areas on our own using travel guides and our faithful feet. Istanbul is a must see city! It is safe, inviting and the people are very helpful. Set up the tour of your dreams and reserve with Delightful Istanbul Tours. I cannot fully describe how awesome it was compared to other tours we have taken!"

We had arranged for Emre to meet us at the airport and on the way to our hotel we discussed how best to use two days with Emre. He was most helpful in explaining to us how we would be able to meet all our interests. Day 1 was spent in a walking tour of the top spots in old Istanbul. Emre was knowledgable and helped us learn our way around the amazing Istanbul. He explained much about Turkish history and we started to get a real feel for the culture of this wonderful country. We were able to explore Topkapi, and the fascinating area around the palace, as well as visiting the Blue Mosque and walking through the cobbled stone streets. We all enjoying a yummy meal in a great location. We made plans for day 2. Emre arrived In his comfortable and spacious van and we then traveled to farther reaches of Istanbul and we visited both the largest mosque in the city as well as a precious ancient church with incredible frescos. Emre was well versed on the history and art techniques of both sacred places . After an amazing meal at a beautiful restaurant , we headed for Asia and the summer palace of one of the sultans. Thanks to Emre, we felt we got a real taste of Turkish culture and we were treated as guests, not tourists. I hope that everyone who reads this will have as much fun and learn as much as we did. We all hope to go back and go to Ephesus with Emre as our guide. Thank you Emre for making our time so enjoyable."

Passing through in November 2013, Emre met me and my work colleagues at the airport and built a custom tour around our rather odd arrival and departure times. With a skilled driver and very comfortable vehicle, Emre was able to take advantage of the driving time to teach us about Istanbul's history. At the sights, he got us past the lines and focused our attention on the most significant details so we didn't miss anything. It would have taken us days to see and learn everything Emre packed into just a few hours. Amazing. When I returned with a larger group of colleagues in February 2014, the first thing we did was book another tour with Emre. The tour was every bit as delightful as the first. Don't spend your time hanging around the airport -- Call Emre and experience the city. Highly recommended."

Emre met us on our first day in Istanbul and showed us all the sites we wanted to see. He is polite, friendly, knowledgable and very helpful. As a government accredited guide, he was able to skip all the long queues at Istanbul's major sites, which allowed us to visit some many more places in a day. At the end of the day, he worked late to get us back to our hotel safely. In the days after our tour, he provided us with an itinerary and advice on how to plan our own private travel in Turkey. His advice was invaluable in helping us plan our own trip. He also referred us to his friend and fellow government accredited guide, Mustafa. Mustafa met us at our hotel the night before he guided us around Ephesus and other historic sites around Kusadarsi. He is also polite, polite, friendly, knowledgable and very helpful. I recommended these guys to my friends who are visiting Turkey later this year and would do so again without hesitation. We had such a great holiday in Turkey, both guided and independent travel, and it was because of these guys. Thank you!"

My cousin and her husband found Emre and his wife Nesrin on an earlier trip, and had such a good time with them that they thought we would be well served to use them again during this visit. That turned out to have been an excellent decision. Emre took point, and was the perfect host and guide. He listened to our interests and desires (four of our group had been before, two were there for the first time), met and exceeded our expectations, and helped us learn so much about the city, about Turkey and about their culture, all while becoming much more than a guide...a real friend. When our group split to see different things, Nesrin stepped in to act as guide for the splinter group. She is equally delightful, knowledgable and helpful. We would absolutely book Delightful Istanbul Tours the next time we go, and have already recommended them to others. You won't be disappointed!"

He planned our days with us ahead of time, so that we got to accomplish our itinerary as well enjoy many new sights and experiences. A couple of our favorites were a private boat ride down the Bosphorus Strait. With Emre's knowledge of Istanbul's history and the sights we were able to see, it was like stepping back 1000 years in time. And, he suggested we drive to Asia to see some sights. Just the drive alone was worth it! Crazy fun! We are coming back to Istanbul again and have already signed up with Emre!"

Everything you would expect in a tour guide (great english, prompt professional, knowledgable etc) but he was so much more than we expected. Emery made us felt welcome and we saw sites, found local business that you would never find on your own or through a regular arranged tour. Emery was flexiable and quickly adjusted to meet our every need. More importantly he not only had a vast amount of knowledge of the City and sites but he shared so much depth of culture and what life is like living in Turkey. We were in Istanbul for a Turkish wedding so Mrs. Emery taught the ladies how to belly dance which was a big part of the celebrations and we really were able to enjoy since we knew the basics of how to dance. I would highly recommend Delightful Istanbul Tours."

Emre was recommended to me by a fellow Cruise Critic member, and via email I arranged a customized 1 1/2 day tour of Istanbul for a group of 12 during our cruise ship stop there in October 2013. Through email exchanges over a period of several months prior to the cruise, Emre provided a number of suggestions and feedback about itinerary ideas, timetables and costs, and put together a custom tour schedule in response to the interests of our group. His guide price was quite reasonable, and a great value for such a complete and customized tour compared to what was offered by the cruise line -- since the transportation costs were fixed no matter the group size, it was more affordable to have a group of at least 8 people; we had 12 but a group of 8 or at most 10 is what I'd recommend. When we arrived in Istanbul, Emre met us right outside the ship Sunday morning with a clean, comfortable Mercedes van (and driver), and we headed out on tour immediately. Emre's command of English is quite good and we had no problem understanding him; as we drove around the city he provided us with a historical and cultural perspective to the area and the sights. In less than 2 full days, we were able to visit several palaces, mosques, and bazaars as well as the amazing underground cistern. Emre amazed us with his extensive in-depth knowledge of each location we visited, and generally gave us sufficient time to explore a bit on our own after guiding us through the main areas. In hindsight, we would have been better served to let Emre purchase all our entrance tickets as a group which would have saved us some time and aggravation-- it turned out we could not use our credit cards at all the sites as we had planned to do. We also ran into a problem with our visit to the Spice Market when holiday traffic combined with scheduling changes required that we cut short our tour there in order to get back to the ship on time -- it would have been better to visit there early in the day and spend a bit less time at the palace. Overall, I highly recommend a custom tour with Emre to anyone visiting Istanbul and Turkey."

Our six day itinerary was very busy, with several plane trips and different hotels. Tujan made all the arrangements and everything went very smoothly. She truly is the best and everyone should experience this beautiful, friendly country at least once. Shah Mat travel was very efficient and gave us the best service possible. Their tour guides and drivers (especially Mr. Nezvet) were top quality. Thank you Tujan, Chora Travel, and Shah Mat for providing us with an unforgettable experience in a magical place!"

When our hot air balloon ride in Capadoccia was cancelled due to inclement weather, our group planned to wake up early the morning of our departure to watch the balloons rise. Even if we couldn't ride, we still wanted to partake in the experience. On our way to the launch site, Nevzat heard about our situation and encouraged us to jump in the balloon ride that morning. We were worried about missing our flight, but this wise man guaranteed us that he would get us to our flight on time. This was the best last minute decision we made on our trip! We heeded Nevzat's advice, jumped on a balloon, and he was waiting to take us to the airport right after we landed. Needless to say, the risk paid off and we made it to our flight on time. We have Nevzat to thank for making our trip memorable and ensuring that we didn't miss out on a experience of a lifetime!"

First of all a big thanks to Ms. Tujan for co-coordinating from this India/Istanbul. Once we reached Kapadokya, we were taken care at each and every point. Right from the airport shuttle to the places, we had a great time. Our flight was delayed by an hour, however, that was very well compensated by the local travel Agents. A big thanks to Mr. Nevzat. He was not just a driver, but a guide, explaining to us about the history, culture and nature of cappadocia. Taking us through the exotic trails on red valley, love valley, taking pictures and what not! He was a true entertainer. I am sure people would want to visit Turkey again because of his hospitality, kind and helpful nature. To give a jist of what we covered in the last 2 days - Uchisar Castle, Three beauties, Fairy Chimneys, Love valley, Red valley, Red river (Suspension Bridge), Goreme Panoramic View, Sultan's pottery, Underground city, Imaginary valley, Monk's valley and Devrent. We also took an optional Hot Air Balloon (Please dont miss this! It is worth every penny.) The tour agency start at 9 am and end the tour at 4 30 pm. Lunch is included and the restaurants were awesome. Vegetarians please specify to the tour guide so that they make necessary arrangements. I want to say a BIG THANKS to NEVZAT (Driver, guide, photographer), Kubra (Day 1 guide), OGUR (Day 2 guide) and last but not the least Ms. Tujan Cevik (Without her, these would not have been possible). We are very happy with their services and I would suggest these names and people to all my friends who would want to visit Turkey again!Thanks!Vijay Soundararajan"

When my friend suggested this the first time, I admit I felt the walls closing in on me and thought this would be restricting and we would have to follow a stringent tour schedule and worse, we would be stuck with the big bus of large tour groups. That was FAR from our experience. I was pleasantly surprised how much I enjoyed my trip.We took the Istanbul, Cappadocia, Ephesus and Pamukkale tour package. This included transfers to and from airport to hotels, breakfast, lunch, transportation during tours and airfare between cities.We had our own personal guide, Metin Ylmaz during our walking tour of Istanbul. He was the best! He was very knowledgable, helpful, thoughtful, easy going, flexible and most of all, FUN! He gave us the standard sites PLUS local insights. We had so much fun, it felt like we were just hanging out with a friend we've known for a while. When you get a chance, request for him to show you around Istanbul!For our Cappadocia tour, we had varying groups but it ranged between 6-10 people. Our days were filled with hikes, cave house visits, underground city and panorama visits, and best of all, hot air balloon ride over Cappadocia mountain and valleys! And while you will have to wake up super early, the balloon ride is so memorable and worth it! Our super cool and fun driver Nevzat even shared with us his amazing photos of the hot air balloon from different seasons and points of view! During the hike, our guide was so helpful and patient with my friend who was struggling with the pace by the other folks. Kubra was also so pleasant and she and Nevzat made everyone feel at ease and safe.Our visit to Ephesus and to the Blessed Mary's house was amazing! Seeing this ancient city and walking and experiencing the scale helped us envision what life might have been like back then. Plus our knowledgeable guide pointed so many small details that we may have missed had we gone on our own.Pamukkale was another natural wonder worth seeing. The white terraces and blue hot pools looked unreal it was breathtaking. They let us decide how we would want to spend 2 hours of our time between the terraces and Cleopatra's Pool. Our guide, Octavio was entertaining with his own brand of sense of humor. He was also nice enough to let people rest during the 3 hour drive from Kusadasi to Pamukkale.If I have some pointers, be prepared to eat lots of Turkish meals! The food is practically the same in every city. Also, do not be afraid to voice out if you are not interested in seeing or participating in one or two activities or sites they offer. This is your vacation anyway and you paid for it!All that said, this was one country where joining the tour group was well worth it!"

Nevzat was my driver for the tour. The amount of passion, hospitality and humor this man possess will guarantee to put a smile on your face. Don't hesitate to ask him anything from side excursions to additional activities. It'll all be arranged accordingly to your schedule/likings. The whole tour was through, on point and at ease for anyone including if you're traveling with kids/elderly. There's so much more to say about Cappadocia, something you have to experience for yourself however. However I will add a slight note to weather. Since I'm traveling in mid March, day 1 was sunny and vibrant... shorts/t-shirt is perfect. Day 2, wow what a change... slight rain and temperature dropped at least 10 C, coat/pants/GLOVES/Umbrella will be more suitable. *To anyone who wish to do the balloon ride, please make sure the weather/wind conditions are within launch range AT THE DAY You're traveling or else it'll be canceled.* with refund of course. All in all, an absolutely terrific experience. 5/5"

We (6 of us) researched thoroughly before we left Australia, and am so glad that it lead to a day been shown around by Metin Yilmaz, our brilliant guide from Chora Travel. His English was impeccable, his smile and friendliness seemed genuine, and his obvious love and pride of beautiful Istanbul was infectious. We were picked up directly at the port and were delivered back at the appointed time. We had an amazing day going to all the places that one must visit when one is in Istanbul, but we were also taken to a wonderful traditional restaurant for lunch, and had amazing Turkish coffee and the BEST BAKLAVA in a small local market. I highly recommend booking through this company, and if you can, ask for Metin Yilmaz, and tell him Lisa sent you!!"

I travelled to Turkey by myself for a few weeks in 2003 and was looking through various travel forums for advice and best transfers from Airport to my hotel in Istanbul. Nejo replied with a few suggestions and over a few emails back and forth he had my transfer organised. I decided to go in and see him at his travel agency when I got to Istanbul and get a few tips on what to do whilst in Turkey.Nejo was fabulous! He arranged my whole itinerary and suggested some wonderful places to visit that I hadn\u2019t even known about. As I was travelling by myself, he made sure that I was staying in safe hotels and even had people keep an eye out for me throughout my journey. Nejo is a very trustworthy man and I would highly recommend his assistance if planning your solo adventure around Turkey.I hope to visit Turkey again next year and I will definitely be using Chora Travel again!

Our drivers and tour guides were extremely knowledgeable about all the sites, took special interest in making each traveler feel comfortable and were always prompt. They began each day with an overview of the activities for the day, preparing us for any long walks or drives, informing us of how much free time we would have at each location and when to conserve our cell phone/camera batteries for better shots up ahead. At the end of each day our tour guides would make sure that we had all the information we needed for our next transfer or the plan for the following day. All the hotels we stayed at were comfortable and the one specifically in Cappadocia absolutely charming. A special thank you to driver Navzat and tour guide Suat who created a playful, culturally informative and educational environment at the beginning which then continued for our entire trip. Bottom-line... had a blast... no wasted time standing in lines or worrying about luggage... even the long drives were accompanied by spectacular landscapes and sunsets... =)"

Our initial itinerary from Chora was to do North on the first day but some reason it was the South tour running that day but in hindsight the sequence doesn't really matter as we saw different things and the guide's explanations doesn't assume you've already been to other sites.The best parts of this trip however were: (1) the hot air balloon ride, which allowed us to appreciate the natural beauty of the place from above. It was already moving towards winter so the scenery was devoid of green (which would have been nice I imagine) but it was all beautiful nonetheless; and (2) our driver NEVZAT who made the tour a lot of fun -- he tags along with the group during the walks and is always more than glad to take your pictures -- he's a pro and took superb pictures that we otherwise wouldn't have been able to take with our amateurish skills! If you do these tours, see if you can have him as your driver and for sure it is going to be a very pleasant experience!"

As advertised, our private tour with Metin included the Hagia Sophia, Hippodrome, Topkapi Palace, Blue Mosque and Grand Bazaar. The highlight was lunch at a small hole-in-the-wall eatery inside the Grand Bazaar where we scrunched shoulder-to-shoulder with locals for delicious beans, rice and meatballs. After we had viewed the obligatory \"top five,\" Metin -- who was justifiably very proud of his native city -- escorted us on the trams and finicular to walk Taksim Square, Istiklal pedestrian street and the many \"passages.\" When dark fell, this modern part of Istanbul came alive as its restaurants, bars and musicians spilled out on to the streets. If only we'd had more time in this wonderful city ... thank you Metin for showing us a superb time in Istanbul."

Fatih did a great job coordinating all the transfers and reservations. Our guide in Istanbul, Matin, gave us a nice tour with exercise along with some good shopping advice. The guide and driver in Cappadocia (Suat and Nezvat, respectively), were very patient with the group and kept a good sense of humor. In Antalya, Ferdi (I think I've got that right), was our guide and quite funny with his view of Roman times. The driver (Ali, maybe) kept good care of our stuff and provided excellent baklava. Redwan, our Pamukkale guide was also quite good at coordinating things and kept things in order. In Ephasus, Sedar was very knowledgable on the history of the region. Almost everything ran very smoothly with very few hiccups (there was a miscue with the transfer from the bus in Antayla, but they made up for it by providing much needed breakfast after the night bus). The hotels were all pretty decent and the locations were very good, especially in Istanbul and Antalya. Overall great tour and I'd recommend Chora to anyone considering."

The tour was really good but could have been better for us if Tujan had given us a DETAILED itinerary BEFORE booking. We ended up with 2 days in a row with 4.30am starts & on one of those days we didn't get to our next hotel till nearly midnight (that's a 20 hour day)! We are in our 60\u2019s so that resulted in us being a little too tired to really enjoy the tour as much as we might have. If we had known the timing before the bookings were made, we would have added an extra day, so I strongly suggest you ask for ALL the details, before you actually book! We found (& another couple we spoke to did as well) that the company does not offer advice or alternatives, which is a real shame. That being said, things were organized well and we did enjoy the small group tours & the hotels. The Ferman Hotel in Istanbul is looking quite tired & my husband went through the suggested hotels in the other locations & we chose what we wanted (of a higher standard) so that was good. The lunches on tour were very good, particularly in Northern Cappadocia. On the whole is was a positive experience & Turkey is amazing! We would highly recommend doing a balloon flight as well - it was a standout for us!"

Lunch was included in the tour but was not very good, we had to share a water between the 2 of us. Turkey has wonderful food so opt to eat something better. The hippodrome is a waste of time since it doesnt actually exist you just see 2 obelisks in a park area which you see withour a tour. The tour ended at the Grand Bazaar but really the guide just took us in then the tour was over and he left? It seemed really abrupt. It was an ok tour but felt like it was lacking."

You have to request for Neuzat as your driver and you get so much more in return!Neuzat was more than a driver. He came specially to hike with us through the Red Valley though he could have parked and waited at the end of the route. He made the journey so much more fun with little discoveries along the path peppered with his jokes. He also took loads of pictures for us and even ended the day with beautiful souvenirs made by his wife for all the ladies. A pleasant surprise from a driver.As we had a co-guide for the underground city, Suat did not share much. But he opened up and joked more during the Red Valley walk. Well, an unexpected wonderful day out with a great driver!"

            "review": "Terrific Turkey!. Our group (two couples) organised our whole trip in Turkey with Chora Travel through Nejo. We booked with them as their itinerary suited our dates and where we wanted to go however it was their reviews on Trip Advisor that ultimately make our decision for us to book through them and they well and truly lived up them! It was effortless to book through them, they were very responsive and informative and organised a very memorable trip for us.We booked the 16 day Turkey Package Tour-Istanbul/ Gallipoli/ Troy/ Pergamum/ Ephesus/ Pamukkale/ Fethiye/ Blue Cruise/Antalya/ Konya /Cappadocia (Exclusive Tour) and would definitely recommend it as a great way to see the key areas in Turkey. The Blue Cruise was the highlight of the tour and definitely something you should include in your Turkey holiday. We had different guides in each area and they were all really knowledgeable and informative. A special mention to two outstanding guides \u2013 Metin in Istanbul (we had a memorable 13 hour day with him which included a day walking tour of the Old City, a cruise on the Bosphorus and what turned out to be an early evening walking tour of Taksim) and Suat in Cappadocia. And our driver Nevzat who made the long drive from Antalya to Cappadocia very entertaining with his charming wit and personality, as well as his amazing photography skills! We booked the Exclusive tour which meant some amazing 4/5 star hotels however we found in some instances that these hotels were either away from the city centres or in an adjacent town. This meant you were away from restaurants and shops but you could easily take a taxi. When this occurred, we found that Chora had automatically included dinner in our booking which was nice (look for half board on the voucher). All the hotels were really good except for the Parion Hotel at Canakkale which although a nice hotel it was a way out of town, the food was not the greatest and the wait and bar staff were very inexperienced which caused some frustration.Some tips to look out for:- Always take note of the name of the travel operators on your vouchers, because it varies and it really helps to have your voucher when being picked from a bus station.- The inter-city bus gives you an insight into the joys of public transport in Turkey so sit back and enjoy it for what it is. Note it generally took longer than noted on the itinerary as well.- The sales people in shops and markets in the touristy areas can been quite aggressive. We found if you said \u201cno thanks\u201d too quickly they would get quite argumentative saying you didn\u2019t even bother listening to them. So we found it easier to just go along with the banter (\u201cwhere are you from, etc) and then let them do their sales spiel and then say a polite no.Overall, an outstanding holiday destination and Chora do a great job of helping you experience all that Turkey has to offer."

He personally walked us through the many attractions, took tons of photos for us, shared some of his great collection of photos and told us a lot about the area. If you have a choice, ask for Nevzat as your driver. Our guide was Suat. He was informative but pretty laid back. He generally gave you an overview and then left you to walk the attractions on your own. His best work was at the underground city. The day two food at Aydede Cafe & Restuarant was great. The day one buffet was very average. Overall, a great experience and a really great driver!"

We arrived very early at the airport and were soon greeted by Nevzat who whisked us off to the offices of Chora Travel Day Trips with great some music and a comfortable van. He accompanied us on our first day by not only safely driving us from place to place, but also by walking with us along winding paths, keeping us on time, taking our photos wherever we wished, and sharing his own photography tips and awesome photos. Turns out he's a professional photographer! His charisma and easy going nature really made the day memorable. We had a fine guide both days, Suat, who is very relaxed and informative. We especially enjoyed our time in the underground cave city on our second day and Suat shared some great insights there. Overall, we were quite satisfied with Chora, and would recommend them to anyone visiting this incredibly historic and unique area in Turkey."

Special thanks to Metin Yilmaz - our passionate and informative Istanbul expert guide for taking us to all the top attractions and many places that tourists would not normally see (go Galatasaray!!!!). Also special thanks to Nevzat (\"I am only the driver\") Gundogdu who was much more than a driver on our very long trip from Antalya to Cappadocia via Konya and also our driver for Cappadocia tour. Nevzat's humour and good nature made our time with him so enjoyable. One of the big highlights was the Blue sea Cruise - a big thank you to the captain and crew of the Alaturka 81 for a great laid back and entertaining cruise which only added to the spectacularly awesome Turkish Riviera - a must do when you visit Turkey.Chora Travel put together a comprehensive and well organized itinerary which encompassed great accommodation, pickups and all modes of transport which was very reassuring to us non Turkish speaking tourists.You would be mad not to choose this wonderful travel agency for your Turkish experience."

Not only did she organise the trip exactly as we wanted to fit in with the places we wanted to visit in the time frame we had but she was completely professional and great to communicate with. Before arriving in Turkey we had been traveling for three weeks where we had to organise everything ourselves. It was so nice in Turkey to have everything done for us. All of our transfers and tours ran so smoothly, we had breakfast included everyday and lunch all but one day. We only had to organise dinner for ourselves, otherwise everything was done for us. I cannot thank Nil enough for the great effort she put in and for everything running so smoothly and stress-free.We had one day in Istanbul where we did a walking tour of the Old City and there was only one other person in our group. Metin, our tour guide, was awesome. He was so knowledgeable and passionate which made it much more enjoyable. He also gave us advice along the way about traveling around Istanbul and Turkey and knew the best way to get into and see every site. The place we stopped for lunch was great also (the best place for food we were taken to in Turkey by a tour).I would highly recommend using Nil to organise your holiday in Turkey and Metin to take you around Istanbul.

My husband and I planned a two-week honeymoon in Turkey and Greece and wanted to explore the highlights of Turkey in a short 3-4 day tour, and came across Chora Travels via Daily Istanbul Tours which had good reviews On TripAdvisor.Nil Yilmaz was our contact person, and she was very prompt in her email replies and put together a 4-day tour of Cappadocia, Ephesus and Pamukkale for us, and took into account our flight time into Turkey (which resulted in an extra night in Goreme) and our wish to watch the whirling dervishes and also the hot air balloon (an absolute MUST).We enjoyed our time in Cappadocia the most, and liked our guide and driver team there the most - Suat and Nevzat - and were very lucky to get them for both days in Cappadocia. Suat was pretty chill but certainly knew his stuff, and Nevzat went beyond his driver duties by accompanying us up some hikes and took photos for us. We later realized his passion for photography - he would tell us where to stand and took really great photos!Some tips to look out for:-Always take note the name of the travel operators on your vouchers, because it varies. If you're not sure what time they are coming to pick up (normally it's written in the itinerary) you can always get your hotel to call them first to check.-You can do your own Web check-in for the internal flights (Turkish Airlines) and not worry abt getting to the airport too early. The booking codes will be sent with the itinerary.-Be prepared to be brought for some shopping of local specialties. In our case, we went to an onyx/jewellery workshop, pottery workshop, carpet shop, leather outlet. They say no obligations to buy, so be firm if you really don't wanna buy, but they certainly stage it well that you will be tempted. But some were really interesting because they gave some demonstrations and it's really part of their local culture. Just heads up!"

Fatih was kind enough to meet us at our hotel in Istanbul to go over the details of our five day trip to Cappadocia, Konya and Pammukule, and answer any questions we had. In Cappadocia, we did a hike, saw an underground city and churches from the early Christian era, and walked through valleys with the region's characteristic rock formations. The hot air balloon ride was definitely the highlight for us and a must do if you can, along with just walking around, people watching and playing with the cats :D in the small town of Goreme. One thing I would change though would be the time we spent at a couple shops they took us to during the trip. Both of us would have preferred to have more time enjoying Cappadocia's natural beauty - for example 15 minutes at the Pigeon Valley overlook wasn't enough. From Cappadocia we drove on to Konya and Pammukule with our driver Nevzat, who was an excellent host and did everything he could to really take care of us. Besides being nice, easy to talk to and funny, Nevzat truly treated us as his royal guests. Nevzat also offered us a glimpse into the local side of Turkey that we otherwise would have missed by answering questions and providing commentary on Turkish life and culture. He was more a host than a driver, and made our long car ride one of the highlights of our trip by teaching us things that we otherwise would have missed as tourists. Think Anthony Bourdain (but much more handsome and funny) in driver form. Ask for him as your driver and you won't be disappointed. Nevzat suggested stopping by the Caravanserai on the way to Konya which is not only beautiful but has some awesome history, and I recommend that as well. In Konya we had lunch and visited the Mavlana Museum and then headed on to Pammukule. Aside from slipping and dropping my cellphone in one of the pools, I still enjoyed Pammukule - especially the Cleopatra pool which lets you to actually swim in the water. Thanks Chora and Nevzat for an awesome trip! We hope to see you again the next time we come to Turkey."

I was lucky enough to find Chora Travel via trusty Google and from my initial enquiry to after I returned home the service I experienced was outstanding. My contact at Chora was Fatih who put together a great package that included Istanbul, Gallipoli (Canakkale), Kusadasi, Ephesus, Pamukkale, and Capadoccia over 12 days (including arrival and departure days). I Was very impressed with the email correspondence leading up to my trip, in particular the prompt replies to my queries and the detailed information provided. On top of that he met me at my hotel the day I arrived to sit down and go through the itinerary and then showed me around the area. The trip included 2 private transfers on the long legs between Canakkale and Kusadasi and Pamukkale and Cappadocia which were very comfortable with very experienced drivers. The tours included in the itinerary were a walking tour of Istanbul, guided tour of Gallipoli through Crowded House tours (this tour felt a bit rushed but was still a highlight being an Australian), the remaining tours to Ephesus, Pamukkale/Hierapolis and Cappadocia were through Shah Mat tours and were all outstanding. My tour highlights were all of the above but in particular the hot air balloon ride over Cappadocia (optional extra but worth every cent!). The accommodation they organised was another highlight, with very comfortable rooms provided through out the stay. Ferman Hotel in Istanbul, Grand ANZAC in Canakkale, Effe Boutique Hotel in Kusadasi (right on the water with every room having a balcony looking out over the bay), Tripolis Hotel in Pamukkale and the Dervish Cave Hotel in Gerome (Cappadocia). All hotels provided well appointed rooms in, great locations with very polite and friendly staff. Another bonus was that breakfast was included every day and most days lunch too. I cannot begin to effectively describe how memorable this trip was, met great people, saw stunning architecture and natural landscapes, was enveloped in incredible history and saw beautiful and rich culture that clearly demonstrates how multiple cultures and religions can work in harmony in the majority of instances. Chora Travel and Fatih I particular contributed to this through the great itinerary they put together. I would highly recommend them to those looking for a great experience in Turkey."

Both made us fell free to explore, to ask , to share view points. I spent two days touring with them and I have no regrets. They were both gentile, respectful and always willing to make us feel confortable. Nevzat is a careful driver, he took care of all of us. He is a real character!My only complain was the driver who picked me up from and to the airport. I do not know his name but he a was careles driver. He did not know where my hotel was and kept me running around Goreme until 4:20 am. I almost miss my Globe trip, since they were supposed to pick me up at 4:30am. The driver did not know where the hotetel was and I had to tell him after going all over the city. On my way back, I had the same driver and he was as careless as the day he picked me up fron the airport. He was on the phone, talking and texting most of the time. Very dangerous trip."

Then , we joined a bigger van to transport us to the house of the Virgin Mary. The atmosphere of this place yield holy. Then , we went to Ephesus to see the ruins and the Library of Celsus. Guide knowledgeable but can be cocky. We then were shown the basilica of st john but did not go down. Instead, our tour took us to a carpet store for 45 minutes. I would have preferred to go to the ruins of St. John and skipped the carpet store. After which, we went to the temple of artemis. The tour finished with more than enough time for us to catch our flight back to Istanbul. Tour was satisfactory but was quite expensive at $320 per person."

Nevzat went out of his way to make sure we had an enjoyable trip. The highlight was the balloon ride which you cannot miss! Nevzat is obviously known by a lot of the companies and he helped us secure a spot in the balloon for just me and my husband, rather than share with 5 other people. He's also a great photographer!

Of course, we saw all of the main tourist attractions but Metin even went out of his way to take us to some of the less touristy areas of Istanbul which was a really great and unique experience. With Metin as guide, we saw the true culture of the city that is not seen when you have a tour that only visits the main tourist sites. He certainly went above and beyond to ensure that we had a fun and meaningful tour experience and offered to take us to extra places around the city even after our tour had ended!"

After 4 gruelling days of walking around Turkey, our last tour was scheduled with Chora Travel Agency, through Shah Mat Tours. Our tour guide, Suat, was fantastic - sarcastic, entertaining, and able to provide enough information to make the tour insightful but not overbearing. Also, the tour schedule itself was perfect - enough walking and sites, but not with an overwhelming amount of walking, which was becoming more and more burdensome in the offensive and intolerable heat of August. Furthermore, we were taken to an excellent buffet for lunch that had delicious, fresh, and plentiful veggies, salads, mains, and deserts to keep you quite happy for hours afterwards. However, the real jewel? The driver Nevzat, who was hilarious and cheeky. The tour included 2 Americans, 3 Canadians (us), and 2 Australians - and he was an endless stress of jokes and sound effects. Much needed after many information-heavy (and somewhat boring) day trips. A HUGE thumbs up. Thoroughly recommend both the tour company and the guide / driver combo if possible. Well done gentlemen... we had a blast!~"

I decided to extend my travels in the Middle East and had only 6 days to spend in Turkey. I wanted to make the most of my time there and see and do as much as I could in as little of a time as I had. I found this company on TripAdvisor due to its high rankings and excellent reviews and I can see why! I had nothing but excellent experiences from the moment I decided to book to the end of my trip. I booked both the 4 day/3 night tour to Cappadocia, Ephesus, and Pamukkale as well as the daily Istanbul tour. There is no way I would have been able to organize all this on my own. Everything worked out flawlessly from the hotels (all very nice!) to the flights to the airport transfers. Nil Yilmaz was SUCH a pleasure to work with, so helpful and went above and beyond in everything that she did. She answered my hundreds of questions via e-mail with patience and was very thorough in explaining everything. She even met me at my hotel on the day of my arrival to go over last minute things and answer any remaining questions! She was also readily available throughout the entire trip to answer any questions or concerns I had. She was a real pleasure to work with and made my travels easy and care/stress-free. I would also like to highly recommend Metin Yilmaz who was my amazing tour guide for the daily Istanbul tour. I ended up being the only one on my tour that day and ended up getting a private tour! He was very knowledgeable and catered the tour to me. His energy and love for the city was contagious. We got to see and do so much. He went above and beyond a \"normal guide.\" He convinced my to add on the Bosporus cruise and I'm glad I did (definitely something you need to do with a guide)! After the tour was over, he even showed me his favorite baklava place as he knew how much I loved food! He added some local authenticity to the tour. He was a great guide as well as friend. Request him if you ever find yourself in Istanbul. I am so happy and pleased with my experience with this company and only wish I had more time to explore such an amazing country! If you ever find yourself in Turkey, I HIGHLY recommended booking whatever tours/experiences through this company!"

I went on an 8 day tour around Turkey Gallipoli, troy, Pergamum, Ephesus and Cappadocia. Fatih our tour coordinator from Chora was helpful from my first email to the last and the trip went without a hitch! The highlight (there were many) like many of the review here was Nevzat a.ka. Abeyyyyy our driver in Cappadocia he was to say the least a LEGEND slightly crazy but super nice and cool! Try driving 4 hours with this guy alone and you will find out! All in all if you are going to Turkey Chora is the way to go for all your Turkish needs! Serefe"

I found Chora Travels on Trip Advisor as the highest recommended and decided to reach out to them. Since we were a group of 9 and had our own itinerary in mind, I asked them if they would be willing to work with us. They were more than friendly and worked with us in creating our itinerary, giving their suggestions and recommendations along the way. We had no issues right from the time we landed till the time we left Turkey. The staff is very friendly. We had the best hotels everywhere and everything was as promised. The tour guides were knowledgeable and English speaking. I would definitely recommend Chora Travels to anyone travelling to Turkey. Ask for Fatih and he will make sure your tour is as per expectation. Our tour consisted of old parents and small children and Chora Travels made sure they made all the necessary arrangement to make our tour enjoyable."

From the start of our planning right through to our tour through Turkey, and finally our drop off at the airport, Chora was prompt and always willing to please. During our planning we had an idea of what we wanted to see and emailed Chora after a friend's recommendation, and looking at Trip Advisor reviews. Chora Travel was extremely prompt in replying and was able to guide a group of four through what we could do in the time frame available. We were met at the airport and transferred to a hotel, and the next morning our driver, Nejoo met us and began our journey. Chora Travel organised brilliant tour guides as we visited Gallipoli, Troy, Kusadasi, Ephasus, Pamukkale and Cappadocia. Each of these guides were so knowledgeable about their subject areas. Chora Travel had organised our accommodation and even took us off the beaten track to some interesting cafes for fabulous lunches,and one lunch managed to cater for a birthday. We spent our tour as we had wanted to, full of laughter and wonderful memories. Thank you so much to our driver Nejoo and Chora Travel! Your assistance helped us achieve the holiday of a lifetime!!

We decided to go for the economic option which turned out to be fine as the only economic aspect of the tour was the accommodation. The hotels were clean and staff were polite and helpful. The transfers provided by Chora travel were on time and made this trip stress-free. The only negative part of this trip was the transfer to Goreme which felt like forever with all the waiting and unnecessary transfers onto different buses. We went around Turkey in different vans with different small groups of other tourists (I think everyone booked under Chora travel). This provided us opportunity to meet different and interesting people. Chora travel's partner agencies were good too (Shah Mat in Cappadocia and Ephesus, Mislina in Pamukkale). Our guides were friendly, knowledgeable and made the trip more enjoyable- Metin in Istanbul, Suat in Cappadocia, Aysun in Pamukkale and Gokce in Ephesus - Thank you."

Our tour guide in Instambul - METIN YILMAZ-was so energetic and passionated about his city that it was contagious. We could see the Blue Mosque, Hagia Sophia and Topkapi palace in few hours. You save time not doing long lines to get tickets. Metin was not only fun but very informative about the beautiful history of his country. People like him makes you come back for sure!.SUPER RECOMMENDED HOTEL IN INSTAMBUL: FERMAN HOTEL. Personnal hotel with the best view you can have from the city. Top terrace with 360 degree view of Instambul: Blue Mosque, Hagia Sophia, Topkapi Palace and the beautiful Bosphoro. A dream come true!!!We also went to Capadocccia , Epheso and Pamukkale. Totally different places from each other, worth it to visit all of then.Capadoccia: Hot balloons tour are a MUST, $ 150 a ride but you will keep the memories of your life. Not only you go up to witness the beauty of Capadoccia but go down inside the valley almost touching the rock formations, ONLY THERE.Hotel Nostalgia was I_N_C_R_E_D_I_B_L_E as it is owned by a wonderful family and make you feel you are turkish. Amazing breakfast in an open terrace overviewing Gomere.I was really impressed with Turkey, mrs civilized, friendly and beautiful that I have ever imagine. Want to go back."

Prior to arriving, Nejoo was amazingly prompt in all his correspondence and worked hard to include all our requests in a custom made tour.All our transfers and pick ups were on time, our van was clean and comfortable, our hotels were of a standard we requested, and above all, our guides were truly amazing. Informative, but also open and friendly, we found we absolutely laughed our way around Turkey in the company of these wonderful people. In fact, we also ate our way around Turkey- with Nejoo never failing to suggest authentic and interesting lunch stops. Nejoo and our kind and generous guides worked hard to make us feel comfortable and we felt very safe at all times. Turkey was the surprise of a lifetime of travel. Astonishing beauty, history and culture. Beautiful clean and modern cities, services and attractions which amazed at every turn.

He swapped our tour days to accommodate us getting a flight out via the right airport. The only thing that would have elevated our experience would be some more specific times on the itinerary as the activity order swapped and our balloon ride pick up was earlier than we were told by 1.5 hours. I am not normally a fan of tours but everyone has been so helpful, the accommodation and food has been quality and the small numbers on the tour has made it a really enjoyable experience.I would HIGHLY recommend it and happily use Chora travel again in the future"

It was the best part of our trip to Turkey for many in the group! Highlights: - Tour guide was great. An agent came to our hotel the night before to review pricing, give us our flight tickets, and itinerary. - Easy since Daily Istanbul Tours planned the entire things from Istanbul and back. They even picked us up and dropped us off at different hotel locations!- The fairy chimney's and scenery in general seems like it's from a Dr. Seuss book. So beautiful it's unreal! Tips: - If you have enough people for a private tour, ask the guide to cater to your groups preference. Perhaps you want to schedule a two hour hike instead of more time at the museum. - Cave hotels can be expensive. We stayed at the Sha Maht Hotel. Cheaper, still beautiful, and great service! - Pay for the balloon ride! It was worth it 110%. Just know that you'll have to wake up at 3:30am. - Don't pay for any souvenirs (jewelry or pottery) at workshop stops with a tour guide. The sticker price is the price with a guide, with out a guide you should pay half, and locals pay 30% of that cost. Barter in town or local shops if you want gifts."

It was 10 days trip and I decided to pick Chora after reviewing a few others on line. My judgement was not wrong. It was amazing service by them. I was given a few choices to fill up that 10 days and they suggested the best option. The agency is very accommodating to fulfill my request. The package that they gave us include most of the things that we wanted. They received us at the airport without any delay or waiting; which i'm really concern when come to time. We spent 2 days in Istanbul; a magnificent city of Turkey. The guide that they gave us has a excellent knowledge on history of Turkey; spoke English very well and very punctual. Bargained for us with shopping.Then we moved to Kusadasi by internal flight, and spent 3 nights there. We were given a 5 stars hotel as our accommodation. The foods are fantastic. We had an ample time to visit many interesting places; with the company of a very good guide and safe driver. Our final destination before back to Istanbul was Cappadocia; where we met 2 great people at a great place; MR NEVZAT and MR SUAT. Cappaodicia is a very interesting place to visit full with history and very picturesque scenery. Nevzat is a great driver; safe and full with sense of humor. Very helpful and caring. Always there for us. Suat is a knowledgeable guide. This was the most memorable vacation that I ever had; visiting turkey with CHORA is like travelling back into time to the historical era and of course things are more exciting when with NEVZAT. Miss the Turkish Kebab!"

            "review": "Stress-Free Travels. My friend and I partook in Chora's 9-day economic tour. The only economic aspect of the tour was the accommodation, which actually turned out to be perfectly adequate. (We particularly enjoyed our stay in Hotel Ilkay, Istanbul). All transfers were seamless and on time, apart from the one arranged by the bus company Nevsehir Seyahat to the bus station for our overnight bus to Goreme. It took 2.5 hours in total to actually get to the bus station but Chora is of course not to be blamed for this. Although we were on an economic tour, we went around Turkey in very small groups. In Istanbul there were only 3 in our group! Every group was different as well so it was a nice opportunity to meet new people. Chora's partner agencies were great too (Shah Mat in Cappadocia and Ephesus, Mislina in Pamukkale). Our guides were professional, friendly and knowledgeable - Metin in Istanbul, Suat in Cappadocia, Aysun in Pamukkale and Gokce in Ephesus - all excellent. I had a fabulous time in Turkey and can't wait to go back!"

From the very first enquiry, email correspondence with Nejo was prompt & professional. He was able to accommodate special requests & multiple changes to the itinerary in the months before we traveled. It was also very reassuring that we could contact Nejo at any time during the trip itself.All arrangements were clearly outlined, with no hidden charges. The trip was excellent value for money--the hotels, meals, guides (Metin & Mr Ozkan), and service far exceeded our expectations.Our domestic flights were on Pegasus Airlines. The planes were fine & the flights were on time, but do note that included checked baggage is 15 kg, with 8 kg carry on.If you intend to do a lot of shopping, consider adding extra luggage allowance.Thank you, Nejo, for such a memorable trip!"

The owner Nejo helped us plan a private trip just my husband and myself, and we covered Istanbul, Ephesus, Pamukkale and Cappadocia. We were very lucky that he accompanied us throughout the trip. He arranged local guides at Istanbul,Troy & Pergamum, Ephesus, who were all knowledgeable, helpful and friendly. The hotels he picked up for us were well located within the city, and when they were exotically located away from the centre, our dinners too were arranged. For lunch we would try out the local cuisine at different places and thanks to him we got to taste some of the best home made vegetarian Turkish meals. Our tour was relaxed and flexible. Nejo even helped us plan our free and easy days and did not mind adding a few places that we wanted to visit. Thank you Nejo for a wonderful trip and we wish you and your agency all the very best. May Chora Travels grow up to be the most sought after travel agency. God bless !!"

After browsing the net to get informations on which tour agent will make our vacation a wonderful one, I finally chose Chora Travel and I must say that I have no regret about it. The person incharge, Mr Neco, promptly replied our mails and questions regardless of time and day of the week. He gave advice on the places that we should visit to fit in the 12 days we going to spent in this beautiful country. The service that they provided was excellent right from receiving us at the airport till we embarked to our country home. We spent first two days in Istanbul and i must say that it was too short to explore this magnificent city, The guide that they gave us was very pleasant, spoke English very well and very helpful.Because of the distance from one place to the other are quite a distance, we took domestic flights and the drivers that received us at the airport were very punctual and very helpful with our luggage. From Istanbul we moved to Kusadasi, and spent 3 nights there. The hotel that they chose for us was a lovely beach side hotel. We visited many historical places and was explained and described well by the guides.The next destination was Pamukkale, which was a 5 hours drive. They provide an excellent driver and guide that make us feel safe in their hand. pamukkale is just another majestic place to visit.Cappadocia was our final destination, and we were so fortunate to have MR NEVZAT to entertain us for the whole stay of ours in Cappadocia. He was such a fine gentleman that will goes beyond his duty as a driver to serve Chora Travel. The guide MR SUAT was a very knowledgeable person that make us feel that we travel back against the time during the Roman Empire.Great job by NEVZAT that really care for my children. They really love him.I really recommend Chora Travel to whom who wishes to visit Turkey.Miss you Turkey and NEVZAT!"

All flights, hotels and transfers were spot on and perfectly organized. In Cappadocia we had Shah Mat Travel as our 2 day hosts. Our hotel was wonderful (MDC Cave Hotel). I cannot say enough good things about our guide Suat and driver Nevzat. We had a wonderful time with them. They provided our best tours of our trip. Our breakfasts and lunches were included and all meals were good. Our other tours in Ephesus and Pamukkale were good but Suat and Nevzat were just so outstanding! Would definitely recommend Chora Travel to arrange a complete itinerary. If you are just going to Cappadocia, you could book your own flight and arrange directly with Shah Mat. One negative is flights on Pegasus. Seating is very tight. Flights on Turkish Air are more comfortable. Do not be afraid of using the \"Metro\" Bus system. We had a 2.5 hour bus ride from Ephesus to Pamukkale and service was excellent."

            "review": "It could be better.. We purchased the 12 days Turkey Tour Istanbul Cappadocia Antalya Pamukkale Ephesus and Kusadasi (Exclusive Tour) with an extra day in Guzelyurt and Kusadasi. Chora travel subcontracts most of the tours out to other tour services in the various localities outside of Istanbul. It is a little hard to rate the travel agency apart from the services received from the local travel agencies and the hotels. That being said, if I were to rate the quality of the tours overall, I'd say good but not excellent. Sometimes our guides just gave large chunks of information and left us to sit down and wait for us at the end. I noticed that on other tour groups the guide would walk with the groups more to each portion of the attraction and then give the talk in smaller more frequent portions.The Istanbul walking city tour began late in picking us up due to \"miscommunication because of the weekend.\" Everyone on our tour felt that the tour was very rushed. The guide tried to sell us the Bosphorous tour 3 times during the tour. We didn't get the Grand Bazaar tour because it was closed on Sunday. Our tour was over by 2:30pm.I would not recommend an extra day in Ihlara Valley as we had. It's very similar to what we already did the day before. I wish that Chora travel could have given me more information/advice on this. As a tourist whose never visited the area you really on your travel agency for this type of guidance.One of the best guides we had was during the Aspendos Perge tour from Blue Sea Garden. He was hilarious and knowledgeable.Of the five hotels we stayed in, we had a major issue with Mediterra Art Hotel in Antalya (clogged shower drain which caused water pooling all over the bathroom and hallway and bites from a mosquito in room; uncooperative service from staff to change room) and moderate issue with La Vista in Kusadasi (major backhoe digging up the whole street to lay down new sewer pipe right in front of hotel next to the swimming pool which caused closure of the street, dust clouds and very loud noise from 8:30am to 7pm. The driver dropped us off at the corner when we came into town. Since we were here for 3 nights, it wasn't as pleasant as it could have been. We had to walk by that mess to get to town. La Vista's views, rooms and food were superior but unfortunately, we didn't want to linger or use the pool because of the noise and dust. I wish that Chora Travel could have checked that out beforehand or had been alerted by the driver when he dropped us off at the end of the street.The other 3 hotels had very good food and amenities Dosso Dossi, Istanbul; Nostalgia Cave, Cappadocia; and Pam Thermal, Pamukkale.Regarding the transfers: We got to everywhere as promised but I think the transitions could have been smoother with a little more help from Chora. For example, when you have a non-english speaking driver just drop us off at a Bus Station with a ticket all in Turkish, it would be helpful to have a written note as to what number gate/zone we should go to and what number bus we are looking for and what time the bus will leave.Also, the ride to Kusadasi has a rest/toilet stop at a mini-mart that is swarming with mosquitos (got bit 3x) so let me warn you all now to put on insect repellent beforehand.The tour guide who took us to the Cleopatra Swimming Pool told us we could leave our stuff on the van. Instead she should have given us instructions to get our swim suits before the van drove away."

We covered Istanbul, Cappadocia, Pamukkale, Kusadasi (Ephesus).Highlights of the trip:a) our driver NEVZAT in Cappadocia. He was awesome. Really took care of us like family - always conscious and concerned about our well being. Ensuring that we are having a good time, sad when we were a little less upbeat. He went the extra mile to make our stay in Cappadocia very good.b) our day tour guide Metil in Istanbul. Such a bubbly energetic and passionate lad. Has very good knowledge about Istanbul historic scene. Showed us all the important and good parts, and kept us entertained through his humor and energy. Great person to be around.c) Suat - our tour guide in Cappadocia. Very knowledgeable and well informed. Quite calm demeanor which suits some of the sights in Cappadocia.d) Hotel arrangements - overall very good, esp in Kusadasi (Hotel Ilayada Avantgarde) and Hotel Ferman in Istanbul. The reception in-charge VEYSEL in Hotel Ferman was very helpfule) overall coordination and transfers between different cities & to-&-fro to the airportAreas of improvementa) Chora knew our itinerary and that we were spending 4 days in Istanbul. I would have loved if they had suggested we stay an extra day in Kusadasi (which is a beautiful lively beach town) and spend 3 days in Istanbul. Of course, we should have also done our homework before the trip. b) We missed our balloon ride in Cappadocia, partly due to weather but partly due to some disorganized operations of Air Cappadocia. We had a window when almost 100 balloons went up one day (& 6 of our fellow Chora passengers got a ride) but we missed the ride because Air Cappadocia picked us up very late, by which time the weather had turned against us. c) Some transfers didnt meet expectation - for example, we were told that Cappadocia to Pamukkale takes 6 hrs, but it took us 8.5 hrs. The second leg from Konya to Pamukkale was almost twice the time we thought it would take (5.5hrs instead of 3).d) Hotel Tripolis in Pamukkale - it's a fancy nice hotel, but internet connection was very patchy and service was impersonal. Quite a different experience than other hotels Chora booked us inDespite the 4 areas of improvement, I think Chora did an excellent job in giving us a taste of Turkey. It is a beautiful country with awesome fun people and great food and most beautiful landscapes, monuments and history. Must visit for everyone."

Since we were only there for a day, we had to choose either North or South Cappadocia (we went to the North). Really fascinating area - lots of picture opportunities! We were in a group of only 7, which was nice, and we had a very knowledgeable tour guide, Zuhal.Being in my 60's, some of the terrain was pretty steep. Driver Nevzat was fabulous in helping me get up and down the hilly areas and I was very grateful for his help! 5 stars for him!!! I'd suggest going to Cappadocia for 2 days (lots of hotels in the area) if you have the time so you can see the whole area, but the one day trip worked out well for us, even though it made for a very long day."

However, Nil at Chora Travel arranged 8 wonderful days in Istanbul and Cappadocia. What made the trip so easy were the prescheduled tours and transportation to and from the airports. I immediately felt comfortable with a driver waiting for me at the airport to transport me into the center of Istanbul. Nil was waiting for me at the hotel, with a full itinerary to review. Every day, either a tour guide or driver would pick me up for the next experience (tours or airport transport). The Ferman Hotel was very accommodating and eager to help. A delicious breakfast was served on the rooftop with a view of the Hagia Sofia and the Bosphorus. There is a lot of hiking in Cappadocia and I would recommend good hiking shoes to avoid slipping when walking downhill (or walking sticks). Otherwise, it was beautiful and an unmissable experience.

All our tours were in small groups of not more then 8 people with English speaking tour guides who were very knowledgeable about the area. The buffets at the restaurants were amazing and all hotels were 5 stars except at Pemmakule which I would give a 4star. All domestic flights were very well coordinated. We even found some alone time to do things on our own, which was a pleasant surprise ! All the touristy business places were optional which made our trip more enjoyable, since we were more interested in seeing the places. All thanks go to Fatih Dogan of Chora Travels . We highly recommend Fatih Dogan for his extreme diligence in answering and addressing our concerns as soon as it arose. Our Turkey trip was memorable in every way with no glitches what so ever.

We travelled to Turkey in October 2014.This is the first time we have used a travel agent to book our trip and also Tripadvisor as a guide in choosing our travel agent, I was rather hesitant and worried at first. But after using Chora Travels, we were extremely happy. Fatih helped with arranging our tours. He was very prompt with his replies to all our questions. The tour was 11 day and customized to our needs which included all the sites I wanted to visit.When we reached Istanbul airport we were a bit confused as there were a lot of agencies picking up people and our names were written along with a lot of other names. But once we realised what we needed to do we were fine. Fatih came to collect the rest of the payment from our hotel in Istanbul and explained our tour itinerary. He also asked us to contact him on Whatsup at any time which was extremely useful as this helped us on two occasions.I need to specially mention the tour guide -Ufuk on the Istanbul walking tour and Shah Mat travels in Cappadocia. Suat and Nevzat were excellentThis trip was very reasonable priced and we were very happy with our decision in booking Chora Travels."

            "review": "A memorable customer service experience. The idea of traveling in a tour group with a tight schedule is unattractive. I was rather apprehensive with booking a tour. However, as I decided to join my friend at the last minute we had no time to plan for our travels. Ms Nil Yilmaz did the bookings efficiently and was patient with me with regards to the payment of the tour. The payment mode was flexible - cash, transfer or credit card. The tour group was small - the maximum it got was 11 people - and the guides were proficient in English. The accomodations at the various locations were pleasant and comfortable. We were able to walk around the town on our own after the day tour ended. In fact, even when my friend lost her wallet (one of a tourist's worst nightmare), Ms Nil rendered her assistance and called the relevant parties (e.g. airport, restaurant - as overseas calls are expensive) to enquire about the missing wallet. Her services were beyond words as she provided assistance even after office hours. I was touched by her efforts.The lines of communication with the various vendors throughout the trip was commendable. In an instance, after making a police report, Ms Nil managed to get in touch with our cab driver and informed him to drive us straight to the local tour agency so that we can begin our tour of the day.It was a memorable vacation even with the mishap. We enjoyed the sense of traveling independently without the fuss of researching and booking multiple tours, accomodations and transportations. What we assumed to be a rushed tour vacation in Turkey turned out to be a memorable trip full of adventures and excellent customer service. Thank you Ms Nil for your dedication and passion in the service/ travel industry."

I would like to extend my gratitude to Ms Nil Yilmaz for her excellence and commitment to going above and beyond, and providing exceptional travel consultation. Nil and her amazing team at Chora Travel truly makes sure their customers are taken care of no matter what, and regardless of time of day.We booked a 9-day package covering Ephesus, Kusadasi, Pamukkale, Antalya, and Cappadocia. Part of what drew me was the intimate group size; it allows the freedom to move around and engage with the guides and surroundings. And as another reviewer mentioned, it is about as close as you can come to independent travelling while at the same time having someone take care of all of the arrangements. From the outset, Nil was patient, quick to respond, and pro-active with suggestions. Six days into the trip, we faced a travel blunder. And by \"travel blunder\", I mean I committed the ultimate rookie mistake of losing my wallet abroad. After checking into the hotel in Cappadocia - which is really lovely by the way - I had an awful realization that my wallet was four hundred over miles away at Sabiha G\u00f6k\u00e7en Airport. Nil was my hero - she was professional and ultimately saved the trip (and my sanity) by making genuine efforts to resolve the issue.I believe it was past business hours, but Nil took it upon herself to contact the relevant persons and provided regular updates on the status. She even rescheduled the balloon tour that was about to take place in the crack of dawn. Thankfully, my cash-strapped state was only temporary as Nil brought good news the following morning. This allowed me to put my anxieties to rest and enjoy the remainder of my trip.The excellent customer service did not end there. Shah Mat Travel, Chora's partner agency in Cappadocia, was informed by Nil of my predicament and kindly offered assistance if I found myself in financial difficulty. And though we were initially booked to fly out to Atat\u00fcrk Airport, Nil re-booked our flights back to Sabiha G\u00f6k\u00e7en airport so I could retrieve my wallet - and at no additional cost! Thank you so much Nil for arranging our trip to your beautiful country. My friend and I had a fantastic time - we did and saw so much and we now have a treasure trove of special memories."

With Chora, Nejo helped with arranging our tours. Being someone who always wants to be in the know of every little detail, I asked Nejo tons of questions, I kept emailing him. He was patient and very responsive in answering all my emails and questions. I always got a response from him within a few hours. We booked 5 days Capadoccia, Pamukkale, and Ephesus. I have a friend who lives nearby Pamukkale, and I wanted to spend a night in Pamukkale instead of Kusadasi (which is about 2 hours away from Pamukkale). We had no problem at all with modifying the tour and Nejo got us an excellent location of hotel, right in front of Pamukkale. A Chora staff came to retrieve the rest of the payment from our hotel in Istanbul, a day before we started our tour, during which time he explained our tour itinerary. The next day, we were picked up from our hotel and brought to airport on-time.All of our guides were not only knowledgeable of their areas, but they were also very friendly, funny, and ready to answer any questions. And the drivers were also very nice and helpful. We spent one week in Istanbul after our 5 days tour in Capadoccia, Pamukkale and Ephesus.. Whenever I had questions or needed some advice on what to do or see in Istanbul, Nejo was always accessible via email, sms, or phone even though I didn't book anything else through Chora. This is definitely a big bonus!Oh also, the price is very reasonable, and no hidden fee at all!I am glad I booked out tours in Turkey through Chora. We had a wonderful time!"

The tour to Cappadocia was fine after reading some reviews from trip advisor and our shopping tours were cut down from 5 places to 3 places where we highlighted this to Ms Nil to have more time for sight seeing.I compared their prices with other agencies and find that it is a bit higher but decided to go for them based on the recommendations from the review. They also provided small group size of max 8 pax.Hiccups occurred during the booking of domestic flights as their website dailyistanbultours have preset boxes for us to enter all details of our name, family name, father's name to book our air tickets (unlike normal airline companies which only requested for our first & last name).

            "review": "How to see and experience Turkey. When you travel to a new country, the usual starting questions are often what to see and experience, and how best to do that. For a country as large and diverse as Turkey those questions can be even more challenging if you have only a limited amount of time in which to do it. But the answers can come easily if you decide that you will be best served if you use the experience, knowledge, and connections of someone who knows the country intimately and who already has a reputation as an excellent guide. This is what lead our small group of 4 travellers from Canada to Chora Travel Day Trips - thanks in part to previous TripAdvisor reviews. In our initial inquiries and communications with Chora and its primary contact/owner Nejo, it became immediately clear that their/his primary interest was to satisfy OUR interests. In this regard, I must add that early on we came to the inescapable conclusion that Nejo is someone who must never sleep or else has a special relationship with his smartphone because our emails were always answered within hours if not minutes even though we were 10 time zones apart (do the math, our daytime = his nighttime). Our interests were not only to see, during a brief 2 week period, as many of the key historical, cultural, architectural, and geographical wonders that Turkey is famous for, but to have some opportunities to experience the local cuisine and way of life of the everyday Turkish resident. Rather than have these expectations simply acknowledged and covered over with an itinerary that could as easily be obtained from any number of other tour providers, Nejo undertook to personally become our primary escort and guide for the majority of our travels rather than assign our \"file\" to any of the other 30+ staff and contractors within the Chora network.Certainly we \"hit\" many of the highlights that are on the travel agenda of many if not most tourist visitors to Turkey including Istanbul, Troy, Pergamon, Kusadasi, Ephesus, Pamukkale, Hierapolis, Fethiye, Saklikent Gorge, Antalya, Kursunlu waterfall, Perge, Aspendos, Konya, Cappadocia, and back again to Istanbul. But we also had innumerable opportunities amongst these stops to experience an array of regional cuisines and out of the way local restaurants and eateries. Personal contacts and knowledge of local establishments by Nejo along with his advice and language interpretation skills made for an extraordinarily unforgettable experience. This included our introduction by Nejo to some of his own property and land where he, with his parents help, have a fledgling orchard. Furthermore, when opportunity or circumstance required (e.g. unexpected rainy weather) Nejo was quickly able to amend our travel plans to accommodate our desires. This included alternate tour sites as well as brief shopping stops at reputable shops and businesses.All in all, if the measure of a trip is the fond memories and remembrances one brings back and keeps, then our experience with Chora and Nejo was exceptional and they are highly recommended to anyone who wants to make their Turkish visit a unique and memorable one."

Previously, when we have travelled outside North America, we have had a local travel agent make most of the arrangements. For this trip, because of the very positive reviews of Chora Travel on Trip Advisor, we decided to contact them and have them organize our adventure. I was somewhat anxious but after my initial email to Chora Nejo responded promptly and from then on the process was easy and smooth. We travelled with two other good friends and a couple of our requests were that we have a \u2018private\u2019 tour and that we have a chance to experience great local cuisine. We flew into Istanbul. Though it was late in the evening Nejo met us and went over the itinerary to make sure that is still met our expectations. We then spent two whirlwind days with our guide, Mehmet, seeing all of the highlights. Mehmet was knowledgeable, personable, energetic and fun. A great introduction to Turkey!Nejo himself drove us on our private 10 day tour. After the first day he noticed that the seating arrangement in the van was not optimal and so changed vehicles. We travelled hundreds of kilometers staying in Kusadasi, Pamukkale, Fethiye, Antalya and Cappadocia. We had been undecided about going on a balloon ride in Cappadocia, Nejo arranged one for us last minute with a reputable company and it was a great experience.Nejo made sure that we saw as much as possible in our limited time. In Ephesus he arranged Serdar to be our guide. Serdar was a wealth of information which he shared in a thoughtful interesting way. In Cappadocia Nejo acted as our guide and had Nevzat drive us. Nejo is from Cappadocia so it was a pleasure to learn about the region from someone who loves the area. Nevzat was a friendly and charming.Each day at lunch we were treated to something different and wonderful, eating at places we could never have discovered on our own. Entrances to sites, checking into hotels was all simple and quick. The only \u2018shopping\u2019 excursions were ones that we requested.All in all a fabulous trip with no glitches thanks to Chora Travel."

The owner of Chora is polite and says that you're not required to ship, but the bus goes there rather than seeing sights for more time.

But when we were in Istanbul, we stopped by the office, and it was actually an office, with very helpful and competent staff members. All the pick-ups, hotels, and excursions were great. We finally figured out that this type of travel is like an airport -- the planes (buses and guides) go in the same direction all the time; it's the passengers (tourists) who change. So you will switch out guides and co-tourists a lot. It works, and beautifully. We will have no hesitation to work with Chora Travel in the future."

We are hoping someday he will come to Canada and we can do the same for him!Our trip with our dear friends Nile and Janice to Turkey was a wonderful experience from beginning to end. We spent 15 days with Nejo. He was our driver and guide for most of our time in Turkey and he was responsible for making it the excellent time it was. We travelled with him from Istanbul to Gallipoli, down the coast to Kusodasi and on to Fethiya, we spent 3 days/nights on a gullet then continued to Cappadocia . We did not have to concern ourselves with making arrangements, booking tickets, hotel reservations or even deciding restaurant choices. Nejo graciously did it all! He was always courteous, prompt and extremely helpful. All of the excursions were timely, interesting and well organized. We learned so much about the culture of Turkey through our time visiting and eating traditional ethnic dishes ( off the beaten track) with Nejo. Not only was he our guide, he became our friend!All of the guides we met were reliable, friendly and professional. While in Istanbul we had the pleasure of having Oslem as our guide. She was extremely knowledgeable and did an excellent job of explaining the history of Turkey while visiting the Blue Mosque, Hagis Sophia, Topkapi Palace and other places within the area of our walking tour. We were also able to avoid the long lines with her as our guide.At Gallipoli, Hassan our guide did a wonderful job of sharing his knowledge of the events that took place during WW1 at these memorial sites. Sardar, our guide at Ephesus was the best story teller I have heard. His passion for mythology and teaching was very apparent through his stories as we toured the beautiful ruins of Ephesus.Nejo demonstrated his love of his homeland of Cappadocia while visiting the Underground City, Open Air Museum and the many unique rock formations. He willingly answered all of our questions about the culture and traditions of Turkey. If you are considering a trip to Turkey, my recommendation is to contact Nejo. He will respond immediately and you can go from there. You will not regret it!"

Our guides -- Mehmet in Istanbul, Serdar in Ephesus and Ozkan in Cappadocia -- were first class, very knowledgeable, sensed what our interests were and made the whole tour delightful.With hiking and horseback riding available, we will be returning to Cappadocia soon.One tip -- if you are spending only one day in various outlying areas, book a room at the TAV Airport hotel in Istanbul and do daily flights out to each city -- much easier than carting luggage to the various places."

All the transportations (planes, mini buses, cars) were satisfactory, we were provided with an excellent driver (Nevzat) and good tour guides in every region. Nejo has always been responsive even when I inquire at odd hours (due to the flight times etc). Truly recommended!"

            "review": "Outstanding tour company!. My mom and I contacted Chora Day trips to book a tour to Cappadocia before our trip to Istanbul in July 2014. Right from the start, I was sure that this was the right company for us. All of my questions (and I had many) were answered promptly. Demir explained everything we would do and see. He made sure that we had all necessary vouchers before leaving on our tour. He was so helpful and kind. We were so pleased with the company that we booked a second tour around istanbul. Ali, our guide around Istanbul was one of the best I have ever had (and I have been on many guided tours throughout Europe). He was extremely professional and knowledgeable. He answered all of our questions and shared so many stories about the city as we walked around the old town. We never felt rushed (which was important because my mom loves taking pictures) and yet we still were able to see so much. Ali even spent an extra 2 hours with us at the end of our tour because we wanted to see the Underground Cistern. He saved us so much time and hassle because we didn't have to wander the city to find it and we didn't have to wait in line for tickets. He shared tips with me on how to best barter in the Grand Baazar, which i was able to put into practice as well. We had a wonderful time with Ali and learned so much and by the end of the full day, I felt like I had made a new Turkish friend. Thank you Ali for making such an amazing memory for us on our first day in Istanbul! Now if you are going to Turkey, Cappadocia cannot be missed! Especially with this tour company! Before we left we were a bit nervous being two women, but once we arrived we realized we were in good hands. The driver taking us to the airport was prompt and professional, the flight was comfortable, the Cave hotel where we stayed was clean and they even upgraded our room for us to the king suite. :-) Our guide was fantastic. He was so sweet and had a great sense of humour. He was extremely professional. I learned so much about Cappadocia from all of his stories as we hiked through the valleys. We saw so many things in two days I can't list them all on here but the highlights for me were the hikes through red and rose valley, the delicious tandoori chicken feast at lunch, the mushroom rock formations and the balloon ride at dawn above the beautiful landscape!. Thank you to everybody at Chora travel that made our trip unforgettable. You are the best! :-)"

I contacted Chora travel another company in Turkey and 2 companies in Australia.While looking at the itineraries there was something with all of them that didn't suit.All were inflexible to change the itinerary except Nejo from Chora travel. Nejo was prompt in replying to my emails and made the changes that I requested to the itinerary. He gave me a list of hotels and when I looked up the reviews on Tripadvisor 2 of them didn't have good reviews, so I told Nejo and he happily changed the hotels. I booked a 3 week tour with Chora. My husband and I felt like we were doing a private tour as most of the time we travelled on our own but when we were with a group there was never any more than 15 and that was only on 2 occasions. All the hotels were in excellent central locations. What I also liked about Chora was only 3 dinners were included and that gave us the opportunity to explore the local restaurants. The tour wasn't fast paced and we always had at least one free day in each city which gave us a chance to either relax, go to the beach or go exploring the city at our own pace. There was only one hiccup where one driver charged me for a transfer, I tried to tell him I had paid for it but he got aggressive so I paid him. When I got into the hotel I rang Nejo and he was very apologetic and the next morning there was an envelope waiting for me in reception with the money. Hubby and I were very happy with Chora travel and highly recommend using them."

We have been mailing him from South Africa for months before our trip, and he has always been patient and keen to answer all of our questions.We did three tours through Yusuf: - 3 day Istanbul tour- North Cappadocia tour- South Cappadocia tourChora organized all three, sorted all of our travel (including hotel transfers to airports, collections when we landed in Cappadocia etc). It was all arranged before the time, with Yusuf handling every detail, and nothing falling through the cracks.I would, absolutely recommend all tours we did. The Istanbul tour takes you through all the major sights, with the exception of the Basillica Cistern (this is also a really worthwhile thing to see).Yusuf also organized discounts on our behalf at places where he has a relationship with the owners. One story which truly shows the honestly and integrity of the man, is that we paid for our Cappadocia tours in cash when we arrived. Because we had people in our group from all over the show, we paid in lira, dollars and euros. We had calculated the amount using the exchange rates, and paid over a mixture of currencies. Yusuf calculated that we had paid $20 too much (note, in total on a +- $ 3,000 bill, so he brought our change to our hotel himself."

My family and I decided to take a nine-day trip to Turkey but wanted to spend some time in various cities across the country (Instanbul, Cappadocia, Ephesus, Izmir, and Pamukkale). After some preliminary research, I came upon this company based on its reviews on Trip Advisor. The reviews were stellar and deservedly so. I emailed the company to see what they might advise and they responded immediately. The company -- and Nejo, in particular -- was a dream to work with on our trip. They were incredibly responsive, resourceful, and patient with our shifting schedules, interests, and preferences. They even came to our hotel in Istanbul the day we landed to provide us our in-country orientation with all the tickets and vouchers and answer our questions. And despite adding on trips and requests in-country (all via email as we didn't get a cell phone), Nejo and his team always responded with the highest standards of customer service. We highly recommend this company to anyone who would like to travel in Turkey. Very reasonable pricing (especially relative to other travel companies) and amazing service!!!"

Although my fellow Malaysians usually like to take tours from Malaysia, I personally prefer to take a tour from a local tour agent in the country that I intend to visit. The main reason is that I get to meet people from all over the world. With no idea of which is a best tour agent in Turkey, I just googled and \"wallah\" I came across \"Chora Travels\" and Yusuf Ozen. It was God sent. Then a series of emails began between Yusuf and I to decide which tour was suitable for my girlfriend and I. We did a 10 day tour of Turkey and extended 2 more days in Istanbul. Yusuf was very prompt in handling my numerous queries and never once lost his cool when handling my demands. As a perfectionist, i always expect perfection and Yusuf's delivery was beyond expectations.The guides were very well informed and the daily pick up times were spot on. We made many new friends, from US, Canada, Pakistan, Singapore, Australia etc and many of them have become my facebook friends as well.I haven't stopped talking about Turkey since my return and have been recommending Chora Travels to all my friends. Turkey is a \"must visit\" country. History has been very well preserved.Yusuf, thank you again for making our visit memorable and for putting up with all my demands.Anusuyah Selvadurai"

A very smooth and informative process. The way you manage to coordinate the intertwining paths of the various travellers in our group is a testament to your experience in your field.And thirdly the way you managed a last minute reschedule when my wife became ill was done so smoothly that we had no additional worries that arrangements had to be changed. You and your colleagues were calm, considerate and highly competent.Nejo, I hope you will feel free to use this an endorsement to reassure those hesitant to book on line with an unknown tour company, that Chora is a organisation you can rely on throughout the whole process.

The email communication between us was exceptional. Whenever we had a question, and these things come up, we would email and get an immediate response. That was comforting in that we were taking a trip to an unknown country. Our trip was to fly to Istanbul at our expense. After that, CHORA took over. We had the first day to ourselves, Day 2 with a full day Bosphorus Cruise tour with lunch and other sites. The cruise, no matter which company you book, is but a few hours, but informative, Back to the hotel at 5pm. Day 3 was a wlking tour of Istanbul, Day 4 we flew to tour Cappadocia, two-day north and south tour, then flying to Izmir for a Pamukkale and Hierapolis tour(s), then Ephesus. Fly back to Istanbul, Day 9 on our own: the Spice Market & Grand Bazaar for souveniers.HERE ARE THE IMPORTANT DETAILS: When we arrived at Istanbul, AND at IZmur, and KaDASKI AIRPORTS, THE DRIVERS WERE WAITING FOR US AND HAD OUR NAMES ON THE SIGNS. all HOTELS WERE BOOKED AS WE AGREED, The hotels had fantastic breakfasts, all lunches were above par (mostly big buffets), the tours were 1st class, hotel pickups were as promised to get to the sirports, We were able to review the hotels via TripAdvisor first and they were just as promised. The optional tours were more than expected! When we arrived at our 1st hotel, the Chora representative met us there and got the balance of $$ owed via credit card. Overall, we had NO negative events, which is almost unheard of for multiple hotels, multiple flights, multiple transfers, multiple tours and meals, etc etc. Eveything was on-time and as agreed. Thank you Chora for a wonderful vacation, fantastic memories, and what a beautiful country!!!!"

From February to April, while booking the trip and anytime I had a question, I emailed Nejo who owns Chora Travel, and he responded to my questions directly and immediately so I was confident this would be a great trip and I was right. First of all, my husband and I booked the private one day tour to Cappadocia from Istanbul. Nejo made all the arrangements including private transfers to and from the airport, the flights to and from Keysari (the airport closest to Cappadocia), as well as the private guide for the day. To our great surprise, Nejo himself was our private guide and it made the day so special. Nejo is from Cappadocia and to have his perspective of this beautiful city made this tour even more wonderful. To really see all that Cappadocia has to offer in one day is difficult so I recommend if you have the time, make it a two day trip and stay in one of the cave hotels overnight. If you don't have the time to do two days (we didn't), don't shy away from it, just be prepared for a full day but don't miss it. It's well worth the time and money. Cappadocia is a fascinating and beautiful place. Nejo was so enthusiastic, knowledgeable, friendly, and fun. He went out of his way to show us everything possible - the Goreme Open Air Museum, the underground city, Pasabag, and beautiful points in between. Nejo has friends all over the area so we were able to see special sights off the beaten path and have an authentic Turkish lunch at a place you would never know to choose if you were on your own. Nejo did take us to a pottery place (again, one of his friends) at the end of the day but we didn't feel any pressure, it was really interesting and we did end up buying a piece because each piece was unique and beautiful. This was a highlight of our trip and Nejo was fantastic! Don't miss Cappadocia on your trip to Turkey and don't miss planning your experience with Chora Travel, you won't regret it!"

Our tour program was sent on a timely manner, clear and nicely arranged in a neat package. I admire Chora Teams flexibility as well. During one of those un-avoidable episode where our flight was cancelled due to bad weather, Nejo promptly sent his driver Nevzat (which by the way, I highly recommend and will request his service again on our next visit) to the airport, picked us up and find a hotel for us to spend the night. One thing that we hope changed is the Buffet restaurant (Hans) portion. It doesn\u2019t meet the Turkish food standard. We felt like we were at an American fast food buffet. Other than that, the other restaurant set ups were all outstanding and highly recommended.We totally enjoyed our trip. We will definitely visit Turkey again in the future. A great part of this fabulous experience was due to the outstanding planning and execution by Chora Team. Thank you for the great memories."

Before liaising with Chora i was with another agent and all he asked was deposit payments ASAP. However with Chora, Yusuf particularly; their needs were to ensure that we as travelers are happy and accommodate whatever our request were. As much as skeptical as I was, he never disappoint me at any time. When we arrive, he made the initiate to explain in detail on our tour and finally spoke about payment. Yusuf particularly has great knowledge, patients and importantly he is very honest which assures you so many doubts whilst you are busy planning from far away in your country.My family kept complimenting how professional Chora travels were. Their organizing skills was excellent, great hotel location, very good vehicles used for tours and knowledgeable tour guides. Highly recommended for anyone who needs a tour in Turkey!"

Our drivers were waiting for us promptly everytime they were supposed to meet up with us. Our tour guides were very well versed in the history and facts of the places that we were visiting and their English was great! They provided for our every need throughout each of the days events. The provided meal on the one day Ephesus trip was actually very good and piping hot for a buffet. Everyone associated with Chora travel was friendly and sported smiles and laughter which seems to a rare thing with most of the people residing in Turkey. I would suggest Chora Travel for anyone touring the sites in Turkey!"

I contacted several other agencies and Chora was by far the cheapest. I remember asking Nejo why his trip was US$600 or US$300 cheaper than everyone Including other Turkish agents and Canadian agents and he said that the others are ripping you off. I asked for small group tours but specified the hotels had to be 5-stars. So it was easy to compare prices. Nejo was also able to ensure that we timed the travel so we didn't have to go back through Istanbul after going to Ephesus by taking a local discount airline to Cappadocia.Even though we were leaving early mornings at 5:00am, we never missed a pickup or transfer. We did have a poor guide in Cappadocia due to sickness of the regular guide and a flight delay, but these things will happen and are beyond the control of Chora. Nejo was also able to book us into the MDC hotel--see our separate superb review--in Cappadocia when on line it was saying that the hotel was full. It also appears that the rates for the hotels from Chora are cheaper or as good as on line.If you want to save some money and still have someone with the experience and knowledge to make your Turkish holiday a delight, I would recommend Chora Travel."

This was by far the best holiday I've ever had, largely due to the amazing country itself but this experience was further enhanced by Yusuf Ozen and Chora Travel. We communicated via email to organise our private holiday through Turkey and everything was organised with meticulous attention and to perfection. I couldn't ask for anything more. We travelled through Istanbul, Cappadocia, Konya, Pemukkale, Kusadasi and Ephesus in 10 days. Yusuf picked the best hotels in each location, ensuring they were central with easy access to all the sites and with great service. I especially liked Gulhane Park Hotel in Istanbul and Efe Boutique Hotel in Kusadasi (simply brilliant!). Chora's partner travel agencies in Cappadocia (Shah Mat Travel with our awesome guide Harun, brilliant drivers Shakir, Hussain and Jengis), in Pemukkale (Misilina Travel with another great guide Embry), and Ephesus with Hakan were all simply the best. For two girls travelling on their own to an unknown region we were a little uncertain about how we would find things but Yusuf and his amazing network of guides looked after us as though we were VIP's and at no stage did we have any troubles. We are so pleased with our trip to Turkey and with Chora travel that we are already thinking about another holiday in Turkey! If you're planning a trip to Turkey, you cannot go past Chora Travel. Yusuf and his team will surely look after you as they have looked after us. The prices are very competitive and the experience is simply priceless!"

I felt blessed that all hotels and transportation had been organised, and all we had to do was to enjoy ourselves. I would have spent one more night in Kusadasi if I knew the hotel - EFE Boutique Hotel was that nice! What could be better than overseeing the Aegean Sea while having breakfast!

On the whole the trip was amazing and I can't thank Nejo and Engin enough for making it so enjoyable we finished up at Ovacik .

Chora Travel gave very quick response to my enquiry, emailed me all the vouches for domestic flights, hotels, and tours.

The arrangement for one night at Cave Hotel Room of Cappadocia did provide good experience. The only suggestion for improvement of the one-day Pamukkale Tour provided by Mislina Travel is to arrange a hotel that provides bathroom facility for non-overnight guest. Because I travelled from Cappadocia by 10-hour night bus, it means I arrived at Pamukkale by 6 am. I was picked up at bus station and was transferred to a local hotel to have a rest at the hotel lobby and to wait for day tour starting at 9:30 am, completing at 4 pm.

It was also good value for money. Additionally, I felt safe as a single female traveller and it was a blessing that everything was already organised and that I did not have to plan or worry about anything (the company organised/paid for pick up from hotels and airport, food while on the tour, entrance fees to the various attractions).After putting him through the last minute planning, it was certainly a pleasure meeting Nejo when I overnighted in Cappadocia and invited to share in dinner.

The hot air balloon ride with Jao Rodrigues was also impressive as was the ride through central Turkey onto the coast. Kemal our Sprinter driver was good company and never did we hear a murmur of discontent from him though he drove hundreds of kilometers. In all a big thank you to Nejo and his team at Chora Travels."

We were a bit apprehensive, at first of making booking arrangements through internet and what more to pay 30% advance to a company outside our country. But this turned out to be reliable and a pleasant experience with punctual pick ups and smooth arrangements. We thorougly enjoyed the tours and visits and the extra days we had was put to good use in doing a bit of shopping for Turkish items for souveniers and exploring Istanbul ourselves. Thank you to Chora travel for the good arrangements. The English speaking tour guides like Halil (Istanbul), Mustapha (Ephesus) and Yawuz (Pukalale) are very good. I am sorry I cannot remember their Turkish names. Thank you also to Yusuf whom we met on the first day in Istanbul."

A big thank you to Chora travels for the well planned itinerary that they had chalked down for us. It was a well organised trip. We were very hesitant to book through the net, but once when we spoke to Nejo over skype, we knew we were in safe hands. We would like to thank everyone who made our trip so wonderful, the Captains who were so punctual, the guides in Istanbul, Harun in Cappadocia who was very understanding and he went out of his way to get us good bargains, the hot air balloon ride was just an out of the world experience with Joao Rodrigues, Hakan in Kusadasi too was really very good.

We thoroughly enjoyed a trip that was well organised and worked like clockwork. We can definitely recommend Chora Travel to anyone who is looking for a fabulous experience. All our tour guides were good and we never had more than 12 people on a tour, sometimes there were only 5 of us. Yusuf was very insistent that we do a balloon ride, it was spectacular, don't miss it. We had over 100 balloons in the air at the same time following 2 previous days of unsuitable weather. We heard about the unfortunate balloon crash which could put people off taking the ride, but hey, cars crash every day and people still ride in them. I must mention one tour guide by the name,Harun Yalcin from Shah Mat Travel who looked after us in Cappadocia, he was fantastic. He really made that part of the trip special. All the hotels booked for us were outstanding. I wish I could get Yusuf to organise all our overseas trips! It is great to be able to tailor make ones Itinerary and not be tied down to specific starting dates and length of a tour. Flexibility is the name of the game. If we were to go back to Turkey we would definitely do our bookings through Chora Travel."

My wife and I were doing Turkey as our Honeymoon and we had a wonderful time. Leading up to the Holiday, I was in regular contact with Yusuf, from Chora, via emails and he was very prompt with his replies and gave some great advise about my original itinerary. I paid a 30% deposit and the remainder in cash $ on arrival.We did Istanbul, Cappadoccia, Ephusus and Pammakule for 10 days. This involved 4 internal flights. One bit of advise if you are travelling from Cappadoccia via Kayseri to Izmir, there is only a direct flight on certain days, otherwise you have to fly to Istanbul and then catch another plane to Izmir. Our dates weren't flexible so we had no other choice, but if you have flexibility rather try and work it so you can have a direct flight.The hotels that Yusuf booked for us were outstanding. I would even say that they were more fancy than what we expected, but we were on Honeymoon so it was well received. Our hotels were 4 star , with one 5 star. If one was to travel on a slightly tighter budget, I would pressume then that the 3 star hotels would be more than adequate.We had private guides and transport in all of the places we visited. The vehicles were of a very high standard ( one mini van was brand new ) and the pick ups at the airports worked very well. Yusuf gave us his cell phone number when he personally met us at our hotel, and he was very pleasant when we phoned with even minor queries... even on a Sunday morning.Our guides were of a very high standard and their English was spot on. Farouk in Istanbul, and Haroon in Cappadoccia were 2 that stood out for us.My parents are planning on going to Turkey in the near future and I will be reccomending Chora travel."

Yusuf ensured all details of our transport and accommodations were efficiently planned, booked and executed smoothly, with no hitches at all, during the trip. Yusuf was extremely responsive for months as we planned the trip, and despite my asking endless questions he promptly and patiently replied to everything and graciously made changes when asked. We felt we were in excellent hands and could completely rely on Yusuf. When we met Yusuf and his brother in person they were both charming and continued to be as helpful as possible. Our guide Sirhan was extremely pleasant and did all he could to please us and make the trip as memorable as possible. The accommodations Yusuf suggested were all of good standards. Since we are the kind to enjoy ourselves no matter what, we had a fun few days on the gulet from Fethiye, and thoroughly enjoyed our companions on the sail. The food was terrific and the gulet captain and cook were extremely pleasant and helpful, but the gulet itself and its accommodation and cleanliness were extremely sub-standard - we were quite shocked as were our companions. Perhaps Chora Travel should change gulet operators or demand better from the company they use. We also would have liked a little more opportunity to customise our itinerary (away from the standardised one, to avoid some of the tacky tourist places (e.g. the baths at Pamukkale). We want to thank Chora Travel, but Yusuf in particular, for his outstanding service. Without hesitation, we recommend his service to anyone. We had a marvellous holiday - thanks to Yusuf, who made what could have been complicated and stressful planning, very easy! Thank you Yusuf!"

I usually like to make travel arrangements myself, but didn't have the energy to do it this time around. Enter Nejo at Chora Travel, who provided valuable advice on how to structure our itinerary, where to stay, and what to do. He responded to emails at lightning speed with thorough and detailed answers. After we settled on an itinerary, he and his team made all of the arrangements (2 intra-country flights, 5 hotels, 2 bus trips, 1 private driver, 4 day tours/excursions, and at least 10 transfers between various hotel / bus stations / airport / etc.) and ta-da! I had a customized vacation all ready to go! It was like magic. Each leg of the journey was smooth and every tour / transfer was on time. The transfers were invaluable to us -- it was a relief to stumble off of a plane or bus and find the driver holding a sign with our name on it, ready to whisk us off to our next destination vs trying to figure out the local transportation system or possibly getting scammed by a taxi. In summary, we were very satisfied with Chora Travel and would recommend Nejo and his team to anyone in need of travel services in Turkey. My parents have also booked through Nejo for their trip in October, 2013 and are looking forward to the experience!"

I went visiting Istanbul and Kappadokia (Northern and Souther major actractions) with a short but intensive trip, organized on request over 4 nights stays and 3 full visiting days, and with all the services and accomodations directly managed by this local tour operator, that we contacted from Italy. I booked all the services by a single contact point (an Italian Tourist Agent, living in Istanbul and working as freelance tourist guide for ChoraTravel) and we arrived with no major issues at the hotel in Istanbul, directly from the airtport with a private car, that was waiting us after the landing. Unfortunately, despite the information received prior leaving Italy, at the arrival at the hotel no one from Chora Travel was waiting us at the hotel or contacted us somehow, so I had to contact the single contact point by myself, in order to define schedules for the day after. The appointment has been fixed at 9.00 a.m. for a guided tour in Istanbul city: our guide (the single contact point in that case) arrived half an hour later with no advice, and we had to contact her by ourself again. The rest of the day went almost fine, apart a long stop (pretty an hour!) at the Chora Travel agency offices, to receive payement receipts and to pay for the air balloon booking. The second day we moved to Goreme in Kappadokia, with an internal fligth. We arrived as per the schedules with no issues, but again with no information provided by our single contact point about the person who was expected to meet that day there. Our private driver arrived later (about an hour delay) and the the local organization decided with no advice to change the tour plan for the first day, from the original Northern visit to Souther visit. Again, we had to contact by ourself the single contact point, and require for an explaination on those changes. Unclear the motivations, and very disappointing the trip that day (driver and car not at the level of the price payed). After my complains to the single contact point, third day went and passed very fine: different driver and differt car, the driver very polite and keeping attention to our interests, made that final day a fantastic one, the best over the entire visit in Turkey. Perfectly organized also the air balloon trip, started at the dawn that day, and resulting in a very exciting experience.In conclusion: I cannot say Chora Travel worked bad, but nevertheless the global quality of the services provided was not at the top, until I complained with them. On the other side, they reacted quickly and saved the last day, but honestly they should have payed more attention to the overall organization by the beginning. Considering the high price payed for the non standard tour I bought, I have to rate not fully acceptable the quality. To all of whome are interested in this travel agency, I certainly suggest you to evaluate their offert, but please be aware some difficulties can appear if you do not pay attention."

My parents enjoyed Turkey like nobody - they had a blast with the food, with the attractions, loved the cave hotel, the caves in Cappadoccia, the tour in Ephesus, they found Izmir as an unbelievably beautiful place, and of course, Istanbul was simply magic. Thank you!"

It got more interesting as days went by. It was a cosy trip as most of the guided tour was in small groups. We even made more friends during this trip. The hotels recommended by Chora was amazing even though they were 3 star hotels! Overall, I was very satisfied with the trip! Thank you!"

            "review": "Professional service with a personal feel. Chora Travel organized a five-day itinerary for me when I was traveling solo during my last week of a three-week holiday in Turkey. I contacted Chora Travel because they were mentioned by other travelers as the agency that arranged for a stay at Vineyard Cave Hotel in Goreme, Cappadocia region. I also noted the many positive reviews on TA about Chora Travel itself. I appreciated the quick response from Yusuf to the initial inquiry I sent via their website, even though I sent it very late at night. The subsequent e-mail exchanges were no earlier either because I was out and about Istanbul during the day, yet Yusuf promptly responded to all of them and addressed all of my questions. On the first day of the tour, Engin picked me up from the ISG Airport Hotel at 5 a.m. because I would be meeting a group in Taksim, about 40 km away. He even bought me breakfast at a borekcisi on our way to Taksim. Freshly-baked borek and apple tea helped ease my worries about traveling solo for the next few days. In Taksim, I joined a small group for a tour of Gallipoli. RSL Tours, the agency in Cannakale that Chora Travel worked with, was great. We were a van of 12 tourists who had booked the tour with various agencies in Istanbul. The drive from Istanbul (Taksim Square) to the RSL Tours office in Eacebat was about five hours. When the Gallipoli tour ran longer than expected and I missed the ferry to cross the Dardanelles, our RSL Tours guide, Hassan, drove me to another ferry terminal on the peninsula, so that I could catch another ferry instead of waiting an hour for the next ferry at the original terminal. It was great that Hassan was also our tour guide to Troy the following day. Transportation from Canakkale to Kusadasi following the Troy tour was via public buses, Truva from Canakkale to Izmer, then Pamukkale from Izmir to Kusadasi. I was fortunate to have befriended another American family so I did not have to do this leg of the journey on my own. I e-mailed Yusuf regarding some concerns I had about the transportation logistics of this part of the itinerary, and he was very open to my feedback and addressed my concerns.  The following day, when I shared some questions and concerns I had of the arrangements with Crossroads Travel private driver in Ephesus, Yusuf amended the situation and I was promptly refunded. I truly appreciated this level of customer service from Chora Travel; I felt reassured that even though I was traveling alone and far from Istanbul, Yusuf (and any assistance) was only a phone call/text/e-mail away. Yusuf\u2019s openness to feedback and prompt responses to my e-mails demonstrated professionalism with a personal feel. On the next leg of the journey, the bus transportation, again with Pamukkale, as well as the transfer from Kusadasi to Antalya was much improved. T4T travel agency in Pamukkale was very helpful in getting to the right bus on time following a small group tour of Hierapolis-Pamukkale. I was also very happy with the accommodations at Mediterra Art Hotel in Kaleici (old town) Antalya, which Chora Travel booked for me at no extra cost when the original accommodations had no room. In Antalya, there was no group tour available for me to join, so Chora booked me an excellent private car driver, Hussein. He not only had an excellent command of English, but also very well-versed in a variety of topics. I enjoyed our discussions during the drive between sites and learned a lot from him about Turkish culture. It was Mr. Hussein who picked me up from the Antalya otogar when I arrived, drive me to the ruins of Perge, Aspendos, and Side, and dropped me off at Antalya airport when I left. It was a joy to explore the ruins on my own instead of being part of a tour group, because I could spend as much or as little time on seeing something without inconveniencing anyone. Upon my return to Istanbul, I was keen on meeting Yusuf in person so I could thank him for the assistance he gave. I had tried to meet up with him in Sultanahmet before I left, we seemed to miss each other every time. Consequently, my entire itinerary had been arranged online and apart from a couple of minor glitches, my five-day itinerary was truly enjoyable. Yusuf went out of his way to meet up with me for a drink on my last night in Istanbul,and was so kind to drop me off at the Metro so I can go to Sultanahmet to meet up with another friend. Because of the help from Chora Travel, Yusuf, Engin, their team, and their travel agency partners in Canakkale, Aydin, Denizli, and Antalya, I had an enriching travel experience in Turkey. I hope to have a return visit soon and plan to have Chora Travel a part of that."

Over that time,between what I wanted to do and with their suggestions we agreed upon an itinerary that suited our requirements.Our trip to Turkey couldn't have been better. Accommodation was fantastic, organised travel arrangements were spot on and the tours that we took in various parts of the country were exceptional.Nero, who we met in Goreme, was very keen to ensure that our on-going arrangements were well understood. Particular mention has to be made of Engin, who picked us up at the bus depot in Istanbul and several days later took us to Istanbul airport for departure. Nero, Engin and the other Chora Travel members that we met could not have been more helpful, friendly and accommodating.Whilst we had a problem with Crossroads Travel in Selcuk when they failed to book us onto a bus to Canakkale, this was not Chora Travel's fault and when we contacted Chora Travel regarding this they compensated us.Having spent almost three weeks in Turkey we couldn't speak highly enough of Nejo and ChoraTravel. Our time in Turkey was great, we saw everything we wanted to see in our time there and Chora Travel took the plane/car/bus time organisation out of our hands."

Never having been to Turkey before, we had no idea where to start with planning the trip, but tripadvisor's great reviews of Chora Travel led us to them. After a lot of back-and forth we ended up with a comprehensively planned, well-balanced 18-day tour which went off without a single hitch. Yusuf was amazingly patient, exchanging literally dozens of emails and meeting us on the first day to go over the plans in detail. He hand-picked the hotels according to our preferences, and they were all fantastic, many with swimming pools which is a great way to wind up a long day of touring. Our guide, Sarjan, and driver, Walid, good-humouredly put up with our incessant questions and requests for deviation from the schedule, and as a result we not only saw the travel highlights, we experienced a lot of local colour and cuisine as well. The gulet trip on the Turkish Mediterranean was a particular highlight, strategically timed to provide some downtime in the middle of an otherwise quite intensive tour. I would recommend Chora without reservation; the only advice I would give is to do some advance research of your own as well. There are so many options it is impossible to do everything, so it is better if you can help Chora slant the tour towards your own personal interests and energy level."

It was smooth from the start with Nejo patiently tweaking our itinerary for our 14 day trip through Istanbul, Cappadocia, Ephesus and Fethiye. All the guides (Eren, Burak, A\u015fk\u0131n) were friendly and knowledgeable and the groups were small so you make friends easily and feel like you are travelling with friends. All our transfers from place to place ran like clockwork, and for once it was nice not to have to worry about anything and just focus on enjoying ourselves. Even though there was a small hiccup in our hotel room booking at Fethiye, it was promptly attended to and resolved by Yusuf (and this was already late in the night after office hours). I really appreciate that we had him as our main point of contact in Turkey \u2013 it is great knowing there was someone who was always there to make our trip as smooth and enjoyable as possible.So thumbs up for Chora Travel and I would not hesitate to recommend them for anyone thinking of travelling around Turkey."

As a single traveller, I like to have the transfers all taken care of so I don't have to worry. Everything was as it should have been. No hiccups at all.My agent was Nejo and he was very professional. I loved the way he got back to me with suggestions and we worked together.Anyone who has any hestitations about booking through them need not worry at all.For me, one of the great things was that my trip was exclusively mine ie I was not part of a huge tour. I had different people with me on the day trips. I really liked the idea of being part of smaller groups for a day rather than travelling on the same bus with the same people all of the time. As a solo traveller, I got to meet so many interesting people, tourists and locals (on the local buses).In fact one of my memorable experiences was being seated next to a Turkish woman on a local bus. I was suprised how good and effecient they were (I think Australia can take a leaf out of their book). My trip also included local flights.Also, whilst I had a few 1 night stays, they were in between 2 and 3 night stays. Flexibility plus.In general the Turkish people are friendly and helpful. It is a great country with such a rich history. Chora Travel helped me to experience this and so much more. It would be wonderful to find other local travel agents this good - it would make travelling the world so much easier!!"

If you want an experience to remember you cannot do any better than a small private tour with Chora Travel. Our group of four adults recently enjoyed a fantastic holiday with this wonderful company. From the earliest emails right through to our last day in Turkey the emphasis was on what we wanted. Hence our itinerary was personalised but with built in flexibility that allowed us to take advantage of opportunities that arose throughout our travels. Even so, the holiday went off without a hitch - all transfers were on time, as were our pre-arranged guided tours and the hotels (mainly small boutique style) were exactly what we wanted. I cannot sing the praises of Nejo and his staff highly enough - their professionalism and attention to detail is second to none. Similarly, Chora's team of drivers and guides cannot be faulted. For the whole 2 weeks the four of us felt that it was like holidaying with some long-time Turkish friends whose genuine warmth, sense of humour and friendliness helped us to better appreciate what it is that makes Turkey such a special place. We were fortunate to have Nejo with us for the whole time. What a fun-loving, caring and affable person! He quickly appreciated that we weren't interested in just the usual tourist destinations and throughout our time with him introduced us to some wonderful traditions which gave us a better understanding of the Turkish people and their culture. Simple activities like eating at small family roadside \"restaurants\" and meeting the local people were very special indeed. Needless to say, at the end of our holiday with him it was like saying goodbye to a good friend - a sad departure but we are hopeful of returning some day. And who will we use for our next Turkish adventure? Nejo and his fabulous team at Chora Travel, of course!"

Our communications with Nejo via email helped us to decide on an itinerary that we were happy with and allowed us to create the flexibility we wanted. Whilst Nejo oversaw our holiday, in some places we had a guide and a driver for the day, at others a driver and at others the time to explore ourselves. The itinerary was also flexible enough for us to make some spur of the moment decisions. All transfers and pick ups were punctual and all hotels were well chosen for their location, friendliness and cleanliness? All guides and drivers were knowledgable and professional but with a much appreciated warmth and sense of humour.We especially appreciated our guide in Gallipoli whose keen interest in the events gave us some very interesting insights to consider. Overall, we were given a very positive view of Turkey and welcomed by local Turkish communities. Nejo's knowledge helped us, amongst other things, to eat outside the tourist places and experience home style cooking. It was fabulous to experience the cuisine we tasted , the marvellously preserved ancient sites , lwhich could rival many places in the world , and for an understanding of the customs. Our guides in Gallipoli, Ephesus , Aphrodesias, Permakale and Cappadocia left us all more enlightened about Turkey's past and Turkey today. Nejo's genuine belief in the value of Turkey and it's culture is an added bonus and he shares this more as a friend having a conversation than a guide giving a lecture. We thoroughly recommend the private tour and hope we will be back some day.We thoroughly recommend Chora Travel."

It has taken us a while to add our comments about Chora travels. A big Thank you to Burc for being a great travel agent - you will do well in your career, you have great people skills and are very helpful. It did not matter what time of the day or night; Burc from Chora Travel was available to us 24 x 7 on his mobile to answer any queries that we had. I only have good things to say about Chora Travels; these guys are professionals; they know exactly what they are doing. Right from the time we landed in Turkey till (13 days after) us boarding the plane back home everything was like clock work. I do not know how they do it but it all seems like a supercomputer managing our tour itinerary. Initially we were not sure about booking our tour online with someone you dint know, but thanks to the many reviews from tourists, it gave us the confidence to go ahead and do it online. Turkey itself was just amazing, my total outlook about Turkey changed after this visit. I will surely love to visit again. This trip was made memorable through Chora travels and the way Burc Bahar organised our accommodation, travels etc. Always right on time to pick us up in the morning. They were very considerate and more importantly made us feel at home and we felt safe, especially travelling with a 3 year-old.I would highly recommend Burc Bahar from Chora Travel to anyone wishing to visit Turkey."

I was very apprehensive booking via the internet, but once arriving at Chora's comfortable office and arriving at our lovely hotel, The Gulhane Park Hotel, I felt reassured that I had made the right decision. All our day trips in Istanbul were very informative and we enjoyed the days with Baruk our guide. Our hotel in Kusadasi was quite unbelievable with a 180 degree sea view, we could have spent another day here. We had a lovely day trip in Ephasus. and Pamukkale including the ancient town of Hierapolis. Our Blue Cruise was unbelievable with the most amazing staff of husband and wife, Captain Yusuf and Fathima - a wonderful cook and Hussain, the deck hand, as well as the great company we enjoyed - we were really lucky to get such a great bunch of people. Antalaya and Perge was a lovely, unexpected experience and then onto Konya and Goreme (Cappadocia) in a private car enjoying the scenery and drive. Erin was our lovely guide in Goreme for 2 days and was well informed on the vast history that we experienced here. Then it was back to Istanbul. All of this amazing trip would not have been possible if it wasn't for the great arrangements made by Yusuf Ozen. All the guides on the various day trips were well informed and accommodating. Next time I visit Turkey, we would like to explore the Black Sea and Eastern side of Turkey and would without a doubt use Yusuf at Chora Travel."

Our july family vacation was planned for Turkey, but we wanted to sightsee more than the usual travel agents had to offer but at the same time be flexible to accommodate the 6 children we were traveling with.After sending out enquiries to a few Turkish travel agents the quick and effecient response I received from Chora Travel was what helped make my decision . With the assistance of Yusuf Ozen's friendly and immediate response to my daily emails ,we tailormade a tour that would suit my family. After 5 months of back and forth emailing and constant changing (without any complaint from Yusuf) we finally arrived in the beautiful city of Istanbul.We were greeted at the airport by the travel agent and from then on for the next 2 weeks our vacation was taken care off by them. Our drive down the coast of Turkey was made very comfortable by the friendly and obliging driver (Haroon) and tour guide(Sachin). Chora travel had arranged an airconditioned clean Sprinter for us to travel in. Considering we were travelling with 6 children ranging between the ages of 13 to 1years, these two really made every effort to make sure our journey was comfortable and obligingly made stops whenever we needed. They were patient with the children and their 101 questions! It really made a difference having them with us as in the smaller towns language communication was a problem and Sachin was always to happy to assist. Our holiday was great and this is thanks to Chora Travel. Every small detail was well taken care of and all the hotels they recommended were GREAT. Yusuf called regulary to check up if we were all well and needed anything. Even our last minute decision to add the Bosphorous cruise to our tour was handled with a smile.Once again Thank You to Chora Travel for making our holiday AMAZING!!"

We have been to many countries before and experienced several travel agents and companies, but have found Chora Travel to be one of the best, if not the very best, travel service we have ever worked with! Not only did they arrange our day trips but in the end they were prepared to arrange all our accommodation and travel arrangements for one full week in Turkey. From the very 1st email to the very last mail, Nejo was very kind, patient, friendly and most helpful. Some of the people in our group were very skeptical about my trusting Chora Travel after only working with them through the internet. But Nejo was true to his word every time! Our entire group was very, very impressed with their arrangements, punctuality and the people and guides they work with. We could not have asked for any better. Chora Travel surely made our experience of Turkey and its people extremely pleasant. Our hotels were just great and our guides , well they were super people with whom we learnt and laughed a lot. The mini-bus they had arranged for our group of 11, was just perfect too!Chora Travel did a superb job and offered our group a very professional and personal service and I would recommend them any day!Marike Hendriksz"

I chanced upon Chora Travel while surfing the net, sent them an e-mail which was promptly replied by Yusuf Ozen. Good 'first impression' I'd say! There was a lot of e-mail exchanges between us as I tried to make our itinerary as best as possible and Yusuf patiently answered all my queries almost immediately. I eventually settled on a 4-day daily trip (inclusive of one day to Bursa) with 3 free days. Almost at the last minute, I still requested for minor changes - I was very glad Yusuf had no problems accommodating to our needs. However, I still had a bit of a doubt as everything was done online ... would it be ok once we get to Istanbul?My worries were unfounded as everything went smoothly and up to our expectation. Yusuf was indeed efficient and friendly. We enjoyed all our tours; the guides were very well-informed, courteous and helpful especially Burak Kabas. He was wonderful! We truly appreciate his excellent service, in fact we felt like we were sight-seeing with an old friend :)Asur Hotel, where we stayed was very clean and comfortable; the staff polite and helpful. At the end of my stay, I requested them to help me post a letter to my friend in Uskudar and she (my friend) received it in due time. How very trustworthy!We truly enjoyed Istanbul and Bursa - the sights, the food, the people and not to forget, the seagulls!! :) I would recommend Chora Travel, anytime. Thanks again, Yusuf & the Chora team ... sizi seviyoruz!"

It was made possible with the help of Chora Travel, especially by the agent, Burc Bahar. He helped me with a 6 days tour to Cappadocia, Pamukkale dan Kusadasi while we were there. It was a great experience in Cappadocia, especially the hot air balloon tour and the walk through the beautiful park/alley. Oh yes, the thermal water of Pamukkale is also awesome. It is not to be missed by everyone visiting this country, apart from Ephesus and lots of museums available over there. Thank you Burc :-)"

How does one fit hundreds of travelers with different itineraries, different arrival times, different preferences, etc and make their trip memorable? Well Chora did. I am so amazed how they fit everything in so well and still make it profitable. In Singapore we often try to book a trip and find that it was cancelled because because there are less than a certain number. Also the itinerary and departure are fixed. With this you can have your won itinerary and timing!Yusuf was very prompt with email replies and answered all my concerns. The guides were very knowledgeable and helpful. Of special mentioned must be Hassan who took our Gallipoli and Troy tour. My husband who loves history and war had a great time. Hassan's knowledge of both kept me attentive even though I had no interest in either. We asked for 4 star hotels and except for one they were great. We were not always on time but their pick ups are! I will recommend Chora if you want a great trip tailor-made to your liking."

Yusuf who did the arrangement was very responsive. We had Burak in Istanbul and Sercan for the rest as tour guides and a great driver, Azmi. They were very helpful with my group of 7 including 3 seniors and 2 children. I strongly recomment working out a customised tour with Chora if you like to see more at a steady pace of this amazing country as compared to normal packaged tours. For anyone deciding to travel from Istanbul to Canakkale by car, it's a 6 hrs journey plus traffic conditions in Istanbul so starting early is more ideal."

Yusuf from Chora Travel was excellent, nothing we required was ever a problem. The guides that picked us up from the hotel always spoke English & were alaways on time. Our trip was for 10 days, so it involved visit to other parts of Turkey, such as Cappadocia, Antalaya, Kusadasi, to name just a few. Our travel was done either by car, Coach or plane, & I can honestly say that we had no problem whatsoever, Yusuf ensured that every little detail was taken care of.

The contact from the agent was very good and overall we are very happy for the tour. The hotels we stayed were of 4 stars and very clean and tidy. The tour guide for Gallipoli was brilliant and very knowledgable about the war. He gave us a very different perspective about the war compared to what we heard at home (we are Australians). Highly recommended to be guided by him again for the same tour.The only thing we were not so happy about was that during the 4-day tour, we were taken to the carpet factories twice. If once, we are okay with it as supporting local business during low tourist season is important. However twice in 2 days was a bit too much for us. We would like to fly back to istanbul in an earlier flght instead of the latest one of the day because we were taken to a carpet shop and a leather shop!"

            "review": "14 day tour everything we asked for, but needed an extra day. We did the 14 day tour around Turkey, including Istanbul, Troy, Ephesus, Pamukkale, 4 day boat cruise and Cappadocia. First up, this was an excellent tour and we had a fabulous time. We saw everything we wanted to and felt very comfortable traveling around. Something which may not be clear when looking at the website, this is not a bus tour where you get on a bus and travel with the same people the whole time. It's more like a backpacker tour without all the work. Most of the attractions are handled by different companies and traveling from one destination to another is either by local bus, plane or tour guide. For us, this was the perfect combination of both worlds. We still had the freedom to do our own thing in the evening, but still met many great people and discovered much more about the various sites than we may have done on our own.Perhaps if we had realized up front the flexibility this type of tour offered we would have been more willing to modify it before hand. At one point in the tour we travel from Demre to Olympos to Antalya to Cappadocia. The bus ride from Demre to Olympos is part of the Blue Cruise portion. We thought the boat was dropping us off at Olympos. We did know about the bus to Antalya and then taking the overnight bus from Antalya to Cappadocia. In hindsight, wish we had either booked a night in Olympos or Antalya, to break up all the bus travel, or opted to take the flight option from Antalya to Cappadocia. We arrived in Cappadocia around 7am, extremely tired and hungry. And we couldn't check in to the hotel until 10am, which is normal, but still made for a difficult day. Personally, I think the best option would be to travel straight to Antalya from Demre and take the flight option, spend an extra night in Cappadocia, wake up fresh the next day, take a horse back ride, rent an ATV or hike some of the local valleys. There is a lot to see in Cappadocia and an extra day wouldn't be a problem. One last head's up. Bring your own towel for the boat cruise. This is standard for most boat cruises of this size but I forgot and had to buy a towel in Kas. Overall, we had an excellent time. Yusuf was extremely helpful, even driving us to the airport at 5:30 in the morning!! Thanks Yusuf for organizing a great trip!"

In Istanbul, we had a private tour with Burak who was excellent and extremely knowledgeable. Engin was prompt and an excellent driver. The problem came when we went to Cappadocia. Our tour was a group, some English speaking, some Spanish speaking, with two guides. We actually learned more from the Spanish speaking guide than the English speaking one. Two other sets of people on parts of this tour were also under the impression that they had booked a PRIVATE tour. The drive to Konya...well the driver did not speak English or any other language the four of us on the minivan tried (remember I was travelling with one friend). In Pamukkale, not private. In Ephesus, we were led about by Zeti (excuse if the spelling is wrong) and a blue umbrella. Decidedly NOT PRIVATE. I have never had to follow an umbrella on a PRIVATE tour. However knowledgeable the guides, however wonderous the sights, however efficient the organization, I was utterly disappointed that it was NOT a private tour. They need to take the word PRIVATE out of the description."

As my cousin and I had litle time to prepare for our trip we researched where we wanted go and then gave Nejo a rough outline. Nejo was very patient as we altered our requirements and our final itinerary was excellent. Our subsequent trip fulfilled all our expectations and beyond. I am not saying that all our accomodation was perfect and up to the 4-star standard we had been promised. There were a couple of hiccups mainly due to sub-contracted firms and a fairly scary local bus ride but on every occasion help and reassurance was only a phone call away. Yusuf in Istanbul was a great help. A total highlight of this trip were the two days we spent with a car and driver organised by Nejo to take us from Goreme to Konya and down to the coast at Olympe. The trip was made totally memorable by the courtesy, charm and patience of our chauffeur - we will never forget him. Our gulet trip was also a magical time but then we always seemed to be reaching for superlatives as each experience unfolded. I am now in the middle of planning another trip in Turkey and Nejo is once again being very patient with my queries. First time travellers to Turkey especially can feel very confident that Chora Travel will try their best to make their trip a true taste of Turkey."

We travelled to Istanbul, Gallipolli, Kusadasi, Pamukkal and Cappadocia. As three women travelling alone we felt very safe and knowing that we could call on Yusuf if we needed to was very comforting.So I would like to thank all of the staff at Chora Travel for making our holiday to Turkey very relaxed and trouble free.

In Turkey, based on Tripadvisor recommendation, I had Nejo from Chora travel (aka Daily Istanbul Tours) create a custom tour for us. Nejo made changes to the standard 9 day tour, and was flexible with the changes and fair and honest with pricing.Nejo booked all our hotels, flights, airport transfers and 4 different day tours.I could not have asked for better hotels - see my reviews for Vineyard in Goreme and Valide Sultan Konagi in Istanbul. Nejo found a flight from Cappadocia to Ephesus, which flies only twice a week, that was not on any of US airline search engines.The tour of Istanbul, and 2-day tour of Cappadocia were run by Chora and were superb. Adem, in Cappadocia, was knowledgeable, charming and accommodating. Burak in Istanbul was knowledgeable and went out of his way to please everybody. Both tours were just 6 people.Unfortunately, there were issues when Chora subcontracted to others. Crossroads Travel in Ephesus picked us up from hotel, and had us wait in the plaza for 1 hour 20 minutes for the rest of group (24 people total) to join us.Tur-ista tour in Istanbul started disastrously \u2013 English tour guide did not show up for the first 30 minutes, so we just followed Spanish and Russian guides. Fortunately, once I spoke to Nejo, he immediately organized a private tour for us, that was, again, great. Burak has encyclopedic knowledge of Istanbul and was more than happy to share it.So, as long you get Chora staff, you can\u2019t have a better tour of Turkey."

We traveled western and central Turkey for 2 weeks in March, just before the start of the high season, all booked through Chora Travel. We had researched and contacted other agencies, but Yusuf was the only agent who consistently stayed in touch, even when we were slow to make decisions. He was friendly, accommodating, answered all our questions with a sincere interest in creating a wonderful experience with us. And it was so wonderful! Went over and above our expectations, and we fell in love with Turkey. The combination of friendly and knowledgeable guides and personalized day tours, bus travel through the Turkish countryside, reasonably priced accommodations in wonderful historic districts, and the highly important English-speaking assistance from drivers and guides to make sure we met our travel connections made the trip unforgettable. This was our first trip to Turkey; we were inexperienced with a of travel service but learned to relax and go with the flow, appreciate the culture, people and beauty of Turkey. We highly recommend Chora for the novice or experienced traveler, and can't wait to return to see new sights!"

I only had a few precious days to make the most of my trip from Dubai to Turkey before heading home to Toronto Canada. Yusuf put an itinerary together for me - a spectacular private tour of Istanbul with must see attractions such as Grand Bazaar, Spice Market, Aya Sophia, Blue Mosque and Topkai Palace and the Harum Eunuchs . Burak was an amazing & knowledgable guide. Yusuf arranged all my hotels and transfers from various airports and arranged air travel to Cappadokya for 2 days including balloon ride. Absolutely stunning and unforgetable especially staying at the Vineyard Cave Hotel. A must stay with Hassan (cave man) in Gerome. I saw the fairy chimmenies and underground cities. My Cappadokya trip was topped off with an unforgetable winter Hot Air Balloon ride before heading home. After 4 days in Turkey and over 2200 photos, the trip was nothing short of breath taking. Yusuf was absolutely amazing, on top of everything making this a worry free dream trip for me. I cannot thank Yusuf, Engin enough for all their efforts. I will be planning my next visit to Turkey shortly and it has to be with Yusuf at Chora Travel in Istanbul. My humble thanks to you and your team! Lana"

I travelled to Turkey by myself for a few weeks in 2003 and was looking through various travel forums for advice and best transfers from Airport to my hotel in Istanbul. Nejo replied with a few suggestions and over a few emails back and forth he had my transfer organised. I decided to go in and see him at his travel agency when I got to Istanbul and get a few tips on what to do whilst in Turkey.Nejo was fabulous! He arranged my whole itinerary and suggested some wonderful places to visit that I hadn\u2019t even known about. As I was travelling by myself, he made sure that I was staying in safe hotels and even had people keep an eye out for me throughout my journey. Nejo is a very trustworthy man and I would highly recommend his assistance if planning your solo adventure around Turkey.I hope to visit Turkey again next year and I will definitely be using Chora Travel again!"

We have travelled all over, but it turns out that our Turkey trip was the most enjoyable trip we have taken, and has become the trip that we always compare other trips to. \"It was great, but not as fun as the Turkey trip that Nejo arranged!...\") Seriously!! Nejo really went out of his way to coordinate each minute detail of the trip, with great hotels, wonderful tour guides, and many experiences around Turkey that we wouldn't have known to arrange ourselves. We visited many interesting cities in Turkey: Istanbul, Kusadasi, Fethye, Pamukkale, Cappadocia (Goreme), Antalya, and back to Istanbul. Nejo made sure that all of our connections with guides or transportation came together without any problems, even when times were altered at the last minute for whatever reason. We will cherish the experiences we had for the rest of our lives. Not only did we have great tours, but we also had opportunities to meet other travellers from all over the world in our small group tours, and local people in each area we visited. What an enriching trip! It was just the right combination of planned tours and unplanned times where we could explore the communities (and visit with locals) where we stayed. When we wanted to change the tour or add another destination on the fly, Nejo was there to help us out.If you are thinking about a trip to Turkey, it is our great pleasure to tell you, \"Don't hesitate to contact Nejo at Chora Travel. He will do an excellent job to make sure you have the fullest possible experience in his wonderful country!\""

The location of the hotel in Istanbul (Gulhane Park) was privileged; the cave hotel in Cappadoccia (Taskonaklar in the Dove Valley) was gorgeous - a one in a lifetime experience - the air balloon travel in Capadoccia was unforgivable. The tour in Ephesus was incredible. All the hotels, guides, food, etc. was very well arranged and organized. We were treated like kings. We felt at home all the time.

Look, research, work out what you want to do . . .then present it to Nejo for suggestions, advise and a quote. Then be guided by what he suggests . . . . He genuinely wants your individual experience of Turkey to be a positive and happy one.My Husband, my girlfriend, and I wanted to add a trip to Turkey after our tour of Italy in 2010. We did not want a big tour, but did not know what type of travelling we could do in Turkey or how to go about booking. I looked through trip advisor, Lonely planet, eyewitness travel and after much reading decided to try Elite travel, which is managed by a efficient and delightful man called Nejo. ( now Chora travel http://www.choratravel.com/ )Nejo took into account all my ideas and made many suggestions regarding an itinerary, sights to see, accommodation and tours that would work for the time we had and the places we wished to see. We did not want a big tour or the real touristy destinations, all the time. We wished to experience some of the culture and meet the people whenever possible, but in comfort. We decided to have Nejo organize a hire car and a driver. He suggested we choose a larger air-conditioned car, which we appreciated. The driver paid for the tolls, parked, picked up, waited, and organized our timing, which made the entire tour an unhindered delight.Roads were in good condition when we travelled in 2010. However, Turkey is HUGE.One thing I would have done different is the time we allocated to travel. I would have allowed more time to have impromptu stops to look at things of interest on the way.(Nejo did suggest this to me through his email contact, but we were limited with our time) Sometimes there was 5 hours driving in-between our destinations. Highlights Corresponding with Nejo, who Loves his country and is prepared to share his time and extensive knowledge with humor and extreme patience.Staying in the Sultanahmet area of Istanbul. Laying amongst the pillows outside of an evening, eating. Walking & looking. . . .you could spend days here. Istanbul walking tour, with Sonar as our guide. (Topkapi palace,Harem,Blue mosque,Hagia Sophia, Basilica cistern were all fascinating)Trip on the Bospherus to see buildings. Grand Bazaar. Spice marketsGallipoli \u2013 this is a must see experience. Very emotional.Troy. Don\u2019t miss the Terrace houses in EphesusRest in Hot water spa in Pamukkale at night time. Walking up the cotton candy cliffs of Pamukkale. Hierapolis bathing pools.Shopping in Selcuk at night. We Visited the Black sheep carpet place. Moonlight silver shop. Visiting a caravansary at night, to see the whirling Dervishes. Early morning Ballooning in Cappadocia. Sunrise and ChampagneStaying in the Anatolian cave houses \u2013 unique and beautiful.Turkey is a wonderful country and Chora travel does ensure you have an exceptional experience.Please give my very best wishes to Nejo . . . .

Nejo from Chora Travel suggested a custom made 10-day tour with a starting date and destinations we specified.Nejo's approach was to use public transport: airplanes, buses (great quality!) and private cars to move us from place to place. By skillfully using a network of staff and links to professional sighseing services on the ground in all key cities, we were met at each juncture of our tour (to and from transport, accommodation, and sightseeing) and arrangements made for the next phase of our trip.This approach gave the impression of individual travel rather than tour travel without the headaches and made the tour interesting and memorable.The key to success was the high level of professionalism and organisation of Chora staff. If we needed assistance there was always someone that we could contact.The arrangements overall were exceptional and allowed us to see a great deal of the beauty, culture and antiquities Turkey has to offer, in a short time. We especiallly enjoyed our time in Cappidocia, Antalya, Ephesus and Pergumum."

Working with Chora Travel was like having your personal travel agent. He and his colleague in Istanbul were more than accommodating despite our numerous itinerary changes. (By the way, the reason why our plans kept changing was because we seriously underestimated how beautiful the rest of Turkey was outside Istanbul and didn't initially allot enough days for places like Cappadocia and Pamukkale.) If you are planning a trip to Turkey, I suggest you call Chora. Because there will undoubtedly be so much to see in this gorgeous country, Chora will give you the best options for managing the different pieces.Here are some examples: 1) Cappadocia wasn't in our initial plans, but when we told Nejo that we'd ilke to see it, he was able to quickly find us flights at reasonable prices; 2) While in Cappadocia, we decided at the last minute that we wanted to see a whirling dervish dinner show, and Nejo was able to find one instantly; 3) When we wanted to add one more person to the hot air balloon ride, Nejo was able to do that without a problem; and 4) When we told Nejo that we didn't want a tour in Pamukkale and instead preferred to drive ourselves around, he was able to locate a rental car in the area that fit our needs at a better rate than available on the web. Now, I understand that this wasn't altruism on his part, and that Chora Travel only stood to financially benefit from booking us on more events. Still, I was very appreciative of Nejo's and his partner's abilities to meet our requests quickly and effectively. I also got the sense that they sincerely wanted us to have a good time and enjoy the country that they are obviously very proud of. Not only that, I felt completely at ease giving Nejo my credit card information from the US because he runs a completely honest business, and often that is the biggest worry when planning a trip overseas.Our itinerary:1) 2 nights in Istanbul - All of the major sites were beautiful and deeply enriching, and just walking around in the historic area was a great time.2) 2 nights Cappadocia - Guided tour of rock formations were unforgettable; you MUST do the hot-air balloon ride; underground cities were worth seeing; dinner show was so-so.3) 1 night back in Istanbul to see the sites that we missed.4) Overnight train from Istanbul to Izmir - our first time on an overnight train was an interesting experience5) 1 night in Pamukkale - rented a car and drove ourselves; the walk up Pamukkale and the hot spring were well worth the drive.6) 1 night in Ephesus.7) Flew out of Izmir to Athens.If you want any specific tips, feel free to contact me via TA."

Despite purchasing our tickets for Turkey ten months prior to departure, pressure of work unfortunately meant we left organising our trip very late.Upon a recommendation of an acquaintance at Monash University in Australia, who highly praised Chora Travel based in Istanbul and Cappadocia, we contacted them.After much correspondence via email we settled on an itinerary we felt comfortable with, much of it based on the expert advice of Nejo at Chora. He choose a variety of key and less frequently explored sites both archaeological (our main interests) and natural. He arranged hotels, bus travel and tickets, someone to meet and return us to bus stations and hotels, private drivers, small intimate quality tours and many extras which we appreciated. We did, however, make some suggestions for hotel upgrades based upon reviews in trip advisor and booking.com which was organised for us. A couple of luxurious establishments in beautiful surrounds refreshed us on our travels.We relied upon Nejo's experience as a former tour guide and were thrilled with his and Chora office staff''s detailed and meticulous planning. During our five weeks , we spoke with numerous travellers and were so pleased and relieved that everything proceeded exceptionally smoothly.Amongst the many highlights arranged for us was a balloon ride over Goreme in Cappadocia, small group tours of Cappadocia, a three day trip to Mt Nemrut and Sanliurfa, the ruins of Hierapolis and the Pamukkale Terraces, Ephesus, Pergamum, Trios, Aspendos, Perge, Saklikent Gorge and some unusual sites suggested such as Karian Caves, Termessos, Telmessos, Xanthos, Kayakoy Ghost City, Antalya old town and places around Fethiyre. Perhaps we should mention that arrivals at bus stations can be stressful if no one is there to meet you but the bus sometimes arrives early, or at Istanbul, two hours late. We found the bus companies great as they would ring the hotel or arrange a free shuttle. In fact strangers offered to do the same thing in many places. Bus travel is an ideal and cheap way to see Turkey if you accept that things don't often go to plan. We were given a preprogrammed phone and charger from Chora Travel in Istanbul which, I think, we used once to check on bus tickets. It does give peace of mind to know you can ring in the event of the unforeseen occurring.We plan to return to Turkey with our grandchildren in a few years and will ask Nejo at Chora Travel to arrange a tour perhaps with a private driver and van. We covered a lot of territory during our time but there is so much to see. The Turkish people are amongst the warmest we have encountered in our visits to 30+ countries.If you are thinking of planning a trip or take tours for any length of time, please seriously consider Chora Travel. We can assure you that you will be thankful for their expert advice, careful organisation and wonderful warm and friendly service."

Tim also stayed extra time with us and showed us the underground cistern and did a complimentary visit to Karakoy for us (which is fabulous)! He made our itinerary for the next few days in Istanbul with detailed information & also about our next trip to Antalya!

It was a wonderful visit to a city we love.Ozlem has stayed a friend and is highly recommended for her knowledge, her enthusiasm and her love of this city. Her English is excellent and we will use her if we return to Istanbul in the future."

The turkey travel centre arranged everything including our meals and it worked brilliantly. Tim Kar was our excellent guide!! He is very knowledgeable, provides all the information about the great sites we visited and ensures we get to see all we desired. We also learn the secrets of Istanbul including shopping, food and site visits. Hagia Sophia, Baghdad Street, Grand Bazaar, Spice Bazar, Ferry to Asia, Archeological museum, Topkapi the Palace - he explained each of the place very well. He is very informative, lovely personality and I would highly recommend this leader to any traveler visiting Istanbul. I wish to visit Istanbul one day again and for sure will look for Tim again for his guide!"

Tim met me at the hotel in the morning and we spent the day in old town Istanbul, visiting Haggai Sophia, Topkapi Palace, Blue Mosque, Basilica Cistern and surrounding area. I couldn't recommend PTI enough, we saw ALL the sights I wanted to and would have had time for more had we not gone at my (slow) pace. Tim had excellent knowledge on the sights as well as broader Turkish social, political and religious history which really added value to the day and led to fascinating discussions. I would recommend booking PTI direct from the website as I sensed the hotel took a big percentage of the fee that should have gone directly to PTI. Have fun in Istanbul."

Our local tour guide was Ozlem. She has a lot of knowledge and is extremely friendly and welcoming.The language barrier was no problem as Ozlem speaks excellent English. We are from New Zealand.Ozlem met us at our hotel and we went to The Hippodrome, The Blue Mosque, Topkapi Palace and The Hagia Sophia before being taken to an authentic Turkish restaurant for lunch which was absolutely delicious. After eating we were treated to a visit of local authentic potters where we were greeted with Turkish coffee or Apple tea. Then we got to experience The Istanbul Markets. I can highly recommend this particular tour. Easy pace and a wonderful, unforgettable experience."

We corresponded quite a bit and set up a date. The thing I liked about Ozi and I assume her brother Tim, is that the tour is VERY CUSTOMIZABLE. A lot of the tours are a set itin and we didn't want that.Ozi met us promptly int he hotel lobby on our first full day in IST. We didn't return until almost 700 that night. She gave us a wonderful into to Istanbul and how to get around on the tram and or ferry system. We were able to negotiate our way around for the next 4 days before our Black Sea cruise. My review date indicates May 2016, but the actual date was May 2014.I highly recommend Ozi for a local Ist. tour. She is very knowledgeable about the buildings and the history. One of the highlights of our tour was crossing back from the Asian side on a ferry. There were these three elderly women on board. One of them was actually a retired teacher of Ozi. They had a lot of questions for us Americans and Ozi translated. The funny thing is they wanted to know about the TV show Dallas. Too funny. So we were immersed in some local conversation thru Ozi. Little things like that make using them well worth it and the tour is a great value.We still occasionally contact each other as well. How many of your former tour guides do you stay in contact with?"

            "review": "Green Bursa Tour. I used their services last year and had a wonderful time. This year, I have decided to repeat the Green Bursa Tour. It was horrible. This tour should be called ''Shopping Tour for Arabs''. We didn't see anything. We spent more time in some random shops (we were left in some random shops three times, spending 1 hour and 30 minutes there - and only 30 minutes for the biggest attractions of Bursa which are Green Mosque, Turbe, and Silk House). We had two different guides - one on Arabic language and the other one on English. Unfortunately, we were the only ones on English and we had a guide who didn't even know who built the Green Mosque. Our guide was more than useless! The only thing he was good at was when forcing us to buy some random stuff and wasting our money. The only thing we were told all day was ''We are entering Bursa'', ''We are climbing on Uludag'', and some random talk about our guide's phone. Not a single word about anything related to attractions we were visiting. All the time you have the feeling like you're in some Arabic country, which I don't like! You are listening to Arabic music, visiting stores that are interesting for their shopping. I came to experience Turkey! As simple as that! When we finally climbed to Uludag, we were offered (forced) to take ATV's and this wasn't mentioned. It is a lot of money for some rude people who almost shout at us. We spent the most of time here and if we hadn't took the ATV's, we would be left alone with our guide up in the mountains (that is not much interesting for someone who had seen the trees and rocks before). I do understand that a mountain can be interesting for someone coming from a desert, but you should be careful and name this tour '' a shopping tour for Arabs''. Nobody else will be interested in spending more time looking at trees than hearing at least a couple of sentences about the Green Mosque! As I said before, I have booked this tour last year and the schedule was almost the same. However, our guide was more than amazing. He was telling us some interesting stories all the time. The guy was educated and polite. We spent enough time in the Mosque and Turbe. The guide was telling us everything there is to know about these (the most important) places in Bursa. And that is what I was expecting this year as well. Such a terrible waste of time and money. All in all - the worst experience ever! I wouldn't recommend this tour to anyone who is looking to see some culture and historical monuments or to hear some interesting facts about Bursa or anything else related to Turkey. This tour is not for Europeans or anyone else who doesn't find trees so fascinating! Uludag is definitely worth seeing, but this is not THE ONLY reason why people book this tour! After a day of torture, the only thing I feel is anger for wasting my money on some random shopping tour for Arabs and looking at trees! We have seen the Turkish delight store last year, as well. However, it was perfectly scheduled in our tour. This year, everything was about shopping and trees. Instead of advising me where to spend our money (like the amazing guide from the last year), this guide was almost forcing us to buy almost everything we have seen because he obviously knew the people selling the stuff. And the last thing, when we have returned to Istanbul, we were left with an extremely rude guide who didn't know English (...) and we couldn't understand what he was telling (to Arabs) at one of the stops on our way back. Luckily, there was a couple of Arabs who live in USA and translated that we had to get off the bus. Otherwise, we would be left in the bus (driving around for few more hours because of the traffic jam in Istanbul). The Arabic guide didn't even say ''hello'' to us all day! I can understand that someone doesn't speak English, but we speak enough of Turkish and we expected some basic manners from our guide. I have tried to ask him something in Turkish a couple of times and he would just turn away and keep ignoring us. Don't book this tour! Ever!"

Moonlight tour2. Heritage tour3. Green Bursa tour4. Princess island tour5. Airport pick and drop service.Let me tell you that this was a gift for my parents hence wanted to pay in advance for their trip. Mr. Tariq made everything so easy and smooth regarding booking confirmation for all the tours, now i had paid everything in ADVANCE and was worried for any uncertain circumstance. But on the contrary Mr. TARIQ was all along communicating with me and everything was spot on right from the airport pick up to drop off.My parents being a bit aged even missed the bus due to their delay on one tour, however this is where Mr. Tariq blew me away, he contacted me via whats upp and arranged the pick up for my parents again for the tour. I am very glad that i chose this company.I would highly recommend this to others as it was a very safe and memorable trip for my parents as they were happy with all the guides and their service.Thank you Mr. TARIQ for all ur support. May God bless you.Regards,Khalid."

We were picked up on time from our hotel (08.15), we then picked up a couple of more people then finally ended up at a car park waiting for about half an hour. We then transferred to another minibus and were eventually on our way this took about 1 hour 15 minutes from being collected.We enjoyed the visit to the mosque and the guided tour around the old sultan's palace. This was the highlight of the trip.What we did not enjoy was the unexpected visit to the leather shop. None of the group were interested in buying any leather but we still had to sit through a number of young girls parading around with leather jackets and were handed small paper pads and pencils to write down the ones we were interested in. This fiasco took up about 30 minutes of a valuable day and this detour was not mentioned on the itinerary otherwise I would not have booked the tour as I only had 2 days in Istanbul.After the leather shop tour we were taken to the restaurant for lunch where we stayed for 1 hour and 40 minutes. The whole thing could have been completed in an hour. It felt that we were simply sitting around killing time so that the afternoon tour people could be collected together.We then went on to the Bosphorus cruise part of the day. When we arrived we then found out that our boat was running 30 minutes late so more time we were just hanging around. The cruise itself was good and we enjoyed this.We then went onto the cable car and once again this was good but we did not have much time at the top as we was running late.In the end the whole trip was running so late that the stop at the spice bazaar was skipped if you wanted to be returned to your hotel (which we did). You could opt to be dropped off but find your own way back to your hotel which we did not want to do as we were staying a fair distance from the spice bazaar.It become apparent that Adore actually sub contracted out this city tour to a company called \"Yes Tours\" who to be honest have poor reviews on TA and I would not knowingly book them or recommend this tour unless you are happy to wait around for extended periods.Perhaps we were unlucky but after having a private tour the day before I really wished I had paid more and done the same on the second day."

We booked it on their web site, the prices are fixed & competitive and you don\u2019t have to pay until you get to your destination each way, also they give you choice of currency, useful if you don\u2019t have Turkish Lira with you, (tip, take euro or dollar and change it in Turkey, you get much better rates). We arrived at the airport we were greeted at the arrivals, the driver was polite and courteous, he took our luggage and we followed him to a luxury Mercedes van. The long drive to the hotel was very comfortable, he was driving safely throughout and we had a very relaxed journey. Great start to a short break with the wife.On the way back to the airport, the pickup time was at 4.00 pm, the same driver came to pick us up, he was few minutes early all good and ready waiting at the reception, we got in the luxury van and started our journey back to the airport, 15 minutes later we were stuck in traffic due to an unexpected demonstration that started in the city. It could\u2019ve been a nightmare, but thanks to Mr Ahmet (the diver) he made few detours, used the ferry, and got us to the airport in time, at one point we were sitting in the car waiting to get on the ferry for 40 minutes (and the air-condition was on just to make us comfortable). He was calm, professional, safe and competent, he really saved the day.The price was very reasonable and for the service we received it was really worth it, they gave us 110% service wise."

I was out and about for 8 hours total, so by the end I was drained. At the end of the last 4-hour tour, I somehow got lost and despite the rules stating that the tour doesn't wait for customers that are late, the tour guide was there waiting for me when I got un-lost. He then proceeded to ask me when my flight home was. He then told the bus driver to drive me to the ferry which would take me to the asian side of Istanbul. From there I planned to take a taxi. Long story short I ended up asking a Turkish woman for directions and she walked me (quite out of her way) to the exact bus I needed to ride to the airport. Both of these acts of kindness probably saved me over $100 in taxi costs.The tour itself was good. There were some obvious upsells...they tried to get me to buy stuff in the bazaar (prices are 1/5 outside the bazaar). I assume they have some kind of deal with the store(s) in there. Anyway, great tour company, generous Turkish people, and a new city to explore made this a great day."

However the terms of the trip were that we paid for a private service just 2 people to Pendik station, along the way with no notification we stopped and collected 2 more passengers from a hotel. The other passengers had also paid for a private transfer, they were also quite upset. We got to the destination with plenty of time so no problems there, I refused to pay until we were picked up, this caused a little discussion but it was agreed upon. At this point I had lost my trust in the company to keep their end of the bargain.The pickup was great, the driver was there on time with my name and was a good driver. On arrival he asked for the full price of a private return transfer, which I paid to avoid argument, and it most probably was not the drivers concern anyway.There should have been monetary compensation and the courtesy of being asked if it was OK to do this. I only received an explanation on arrival at the train station after negotiating to pay upon the return. I did this to ensure that the company would honour the agreement.I wrote to the director of the company and have yet to hear back from him. I would hope that this is not their usual practice. I have read other reviews and they seem to be good."

So, 3 hours and 40 minutes were consisting of: visiting Spice market (1 hour, without guide), Bosphor boat tour (1 hour and 15 minutes). You are probably wondering what's happened with 1 hour and 25 minutes? Well, you spend this time in the bus - transfering from new European part of the city to the old one and getting back - either to Kabatas (as starting point for all boat tours) or to hotel.This half day tour costs (with \"discount included\") 29 euros! If you want to see Bosphor individually, you should spend ONLY 5 euros for the above mentioned boat trip. So, explore Istanbul on your own! It wouldn't be so expensive!!!"

Not only was he historically sound with both the political background of the time as well as the campaign itself, it was his perspective from the Turkish viewpoint that made the day. His pride in his country and his portrayal of the bond developed forever between Turkey and Aus/NZ was inspiring as it appears that both Australia and Turkey created their identities from that campaign. Only negative was choice of meal stop both going and coming back from Istanbul. With a 5 hour drive the stop was only 1 hour out of Istanbul at an expensive fixed buffet set price restaurant. Too early going down and too late coming back."

If u are into paying for something u will never get, if u are ok to be treated without respect and be left alone in a strange city never the less u payed for being taken care of and like to get super rude feed back to your complaints about unsatisfactory service than welcome to TARIK OZAKTAS`Istanbul Daily City Tour!Super expensive one way ride around the city and absence of transfer to the hotel. They just left me and my parents in a middle of nowhere, so we had to get a taxi to get back to the hotel. If u want to get a Bosphorus Boat tour just go to the harbor, get on any boat and enjoy it for 12 lira instead of wasting half day of your time and 27 euros (around 90 lira). What they call city excursion is just driving from your hotel to another bus station, putting you on another bus that drives same way back and brings u to Egyptian market, leaves u there for 1 hour, and gets u to the boat. After 1 hour trip u are all alone on a left bank of the city and there is no one waiting for u to drive u back to the hotel, even though u payed for it! So good luck to wasting time and paying 10 time more than it costs!!!!Oh yes, If u feel like to call them after to get any explanation about your transfer to the hotel, be ready to hear that u are the one who found them, you are in their country and its your own fault!Latter on I got an e-mail from the owner that says that it was us who decided to stay and told to the driver to leave without us. We have never seen anyone waiting for us and never spoken to the driver. This is totally unacceptable way of treating people and pure disgrace. I would never recommend this company but would strongly advice avoid any services they provide. Super unpleasant experience!!!"

Do wear comfortable flat walking shoes/sandals as streets are cobbled and you are on you feet most of the day, also Ladies do bring a scarf to cover head and shoulders and don't wear scanty clothing i.e. tiny straps on tops and shorts as you do need to cover up and it is respectable in their culture.Even men shouldn't wear shorts in the religious sites.After the tour was finished Mehmet made sure we went to correct transport for journey home. We stayed near the airport so had to pay extra for our taxi but didn't mind as were well looked after. Felt very safe all the timeWould recommend This Tour company to anyone , but as it was walking all day you need to have a good level of fitness."

We were two blonde girls at the age of 21, we had just been to Alanya(party place), and there is a big cultural difference. We hadn't given it any thought, that they would treat us differently from Alanya. But they do. So cover up. These men cannot handle it, they don't know how to act so they get all nasty or all loving. But thats just istanbul. The tour was great! Although our guide kinda felt the same way as the rest of the men, and asked for our telephone numbers and sending us cheeky faces.. But it is also a little funny. Didn't ruin the trip at all.If there was something they should change, it should be the information about starting location. We didn't know that there was a location where trip began. It would have been way easier to just go there, instead of going to the hotel to get picked up and then going to the starting point."

The visit to the Hagia Sophia Museum,, the Blue Mosque and Topkapi Palace were the star attractions but even very early on a Saturday morning the crowds were daunting- to the point that enjoyment was hard to measure. The guide was utterly fantastic- his knowledge of Turkish history and frankly English was impressive. But, it became impossible to see a fraction of the sights. The visit to Topkapi Palace alone lasted about 2 and 1/2 hours but the queues for the Treasury and the Imperial Harem were each over 90 minutes- in the heat! We did not get in."

            "review": "Avoid booking from this company at all costs! . So, my first impression of this company was great - I booked the full-day Istanbul Heritage Tour and within minutes I received a confirmation E-mail of my booking and the pick-up time (8:15 am), which I thought was excellent. I'm a big fan of companies with strong online organisation and right away I was impressed by their level of service. However, they didn't turn out to be so great. The driver showed up 15 minutes earlier than the agreed time; we were still having breakfast at that time and were rushed to finish earing. On the way to the bus, my dad made a comment to the driver, who was very unwelcoming of feedback, about how he had arrived 15 minutes before the stipulated time. The driver just nodded and told us to get on the bus.After getting on the bus, we drove for at least 20 minutes to 2 different hotels in order to pick up the rest of the people in the tour. We then drove a further 10 minutes to pick-up the tour guide, whose name I believe was \u00c7akir or Shakir, and an additional floc of tourists. In total, we had 20-25 tourists squeezed into one bus with barely any room to move around - I had to sit 2 chairs away from my family, next to a woman who also was sitting away from her family. To make things worse, the guide started handing in radio headsets, which you wear to hear the guide in places where there's significant noise. When I made the booking, I was under the impression that the company runs small-group tours. But now, I did not only have to squeeze through the dozens of tourists to find our guide, I had to wear an old piece of equipment which has been worn a hundred time just to hear his commentary. This takes me to the worst part of the tour - the guide himself. As I mentioned earlier his name was \u00c7akir (or something along those lines). While his English was acceptable, half of the time I had to concentrate so hard in order to understand what he was saying. He was trying too hard to put on an American accent, but it was only making his speech harder to grasp. Our first destination was the Blue Mosque. Here's my biggest complaint: instead of focusing on the history and architecture of the mosque, which is what I expected to learn about especially that I'm a student in those fields, the guide focused solely on Islamic practices in the mosque, as if he was on a mission to convert us! He completely ignored the fact that different tourists might be interested in different aspects of the building and instead started preaching us about religion. I even started to notice that some tourists were losing interest. Next, he took us to Hagia Sophia. Again, he made no single reference to the architecture of the building and how it inspired generations of designers and focused instead on comparing Islam and Christianity, which I found was offensive and aggregating for the Christian tourists in the group. He spoke about the Iconic movement and how Christians destroyed places of worship. Perhaps his biggest derogatory comment was his statement that Christians are similar to certain hostile groups operating in the Middle East today. These comments should not have been made to a group that is not there to indulge in religious discussion, but rather to see the historical significance of the buildings they were seeing. After that, \u00c7akir took us to the Grand Bazaar. Well, not really; before he even showed us where the bazaar was, he took us into a building that belongs to a company that sells Turkish hand-made rugs for a \"demonstration\". He promised that it'd take 15 minutes at max, but ended up taking 1 full hour! So here's my experience: if you'd like to give this company a shot, then go ahead but be weary of this specific guide. There's other companies that offer the same tour, but in groups of 9. I can assure you that you'd have much more fun and education (without your guide rambling on and on about religion) if you were to take one of those small group tours."

The shuttle (to pick us up from the hotel) always came within 15 min of the indicated pickup times. The tours were all great, the tour guides were particularly impressive, very knowledgeable, very hardworking people, they took their job seriously. We learnt a lot from them. The taxi service from the airport to Istanbul and then later back was very impressive. They waited for us at the airport with a sign with my name on it. The cars were high end cars, spotless, driver safe courteous. Over the period of the preparations and our stay there (in Istanbul) I must have sent a dozen emails to Mr Mehmet Ozaktas, general manager of Adore Tours, either asking questions, or modifying taxi pickup times. He always replied within a few hours and arranged what I asked for. Truly excellent customer service. I would use Adore tours again."

I have not given an excellent rating for two reasons:- we were kept waiting when we arrived for about 20 minutes - admittedly our plane was late and it took us ages to get through passport control etc. We were just told to go and sit over by a cafe but it was not explained what we were waiting for. We were tired and thirsty and somehow it wasn't a nice welcome - however, the journey then to our hotel was absolutely fine and the little bottles of water supplied were just what we needed- the driver on the return journey spent a lot of time on the phone (holding to his ear) so therefore driving with one hand on the steering wheel. Why can't they have a hands free device fitted? Would be so much safer.Despite these two negatives, the service is good, the drivers polite and carry your luggage. The uniform and whole image is one of professionalism."

Super clean and spacious vehicle and friendly and knowledgeable driver who knew his routes very well indeed to try and beat the traffic.Also super value for money against hotel transfer cost.If you want a professional, personal safe service then I recommend you only consider Adore, one of the best companies I have used in over 30 years on International travel."

My hotel is situated quite outside the city center but I was properly picked-up on time and also returned there as well.The itinerary was great, so was our guide who spoke English very well. We also had lunch which worked fine, too - nothing to complain about.The only thing on the criticism side would be that the tour is fast-paced - so the speed of walking around is I would say above-average. We did of course not \"run\" but don't expect lots of time for photo stops (e.g. you spend max 10 minutes in the mosques). The reason for this is the very good itinerary which covers lots of spots - so there is a trade-off between \"seeing many things\" and \"spending time\", since the overall tour time is only around 3hrs (in the morning, and then after lunch once again). But for me the tour-pace was compeltely fine.Definitely I can recommend the tour and would book there again."

The company has safe, punctual drivers; relatively new vehicles; and a very professional general manager.My wife, daughter, and I recently travelled from the Gulf Region to Istanbul for a five day trip. Prior to commencing this trip, I contacted several airport transportation services in Istanbul via the Internet. The General Manager of Adore Tourism, Tarik Ozaktas, impressed me by his timely and informative email responses. Unlike the other companies, Tarik's messages also made sense and demonstrated genuine professionalism.Tarik delivered on all of his promises. Moreover, when I needed him to revise previous plans based on changes in my family's schedule, Tarik readily adapted and implemented required actions. He also offered prices that are less than a commercial taxi and a comfortable van that is considerably larger than a commercial taxi.Bottom Line: If I ever travel to Istanbul again and require ground transportation, I will seek Tarik's assistance."

That was a bit of a disappointment, and it would have been better if this had been indicated beforehand so that we could have rearranged to another day.The guide we had was excellent. His English was perfect, and and he kept us very well informed throughout about what we were seeing plus plenty of background material on Turkish history, current politics, and even about forthcoming sporting events involving Turkish and British football teams! The length of the tour was just right for us. There was an option to add on a lunch and an afternoon tour, but we declined this. For others I think the full day would have been perfect.My wife made the mistake of not having suitable head covering for visiting the mosques. This was little problem as there were plenty of people selling shawls, but a word of warning in the tour description would have been helpful.All in all, we would recommend the tour."

Adore Tourism was prompt to reply, I booked the afternoon Bosphorous cruise on that morning itself and they replied promptly and advised us where to wait for the bus. I think for those staying in area outside old city should consider this as they provide pick up service nearer to where your hotel is. For us that stayed in Taksim Square, this service is much appreciated.Bosphorous Cruise cost 29euros and the Istanbul Heritage Tour costs 59euros, both are relatively cheaper than those I have researched on (usually 35euros and 70 euros respectively)Bosphorous cruise is just something leisure where we cruise along the Bosphorous which seperates the Asia and Europe of Turkey. Before the cruise, we were brought to the Spice Market, just took a short walk and took some pictures, did not really have much time to shop but it is fine with us.Istanbul Heritage tour is a whole day tour which covers a number of sites such as The Blue Mosque, Hagia Sohpia, Grand Bazaar etc etc... The time in grand bazaar was relatively short, not much time to shop as well. But some requested to be dropped off at Grand Bazaar after the tour and the guide gladly agreed. Nothing really fanciful at grand bazaar so we were ok with the time given (about 30 minutes)Lunch provided was mediocre, try to avoid ordering drinks from the restaurant you were brought to as it can be quite expensive (7TL for a can of drink)All in all the tours are fine"

In both cases, communication from the company could have been clearer. I was picked up in the morning at my hotel by drivers with no English, so it was initially not clear where we were going. I also think the Troy and Gallipoli tours could be organized a little more tightly; if they were, a tour to Troy could last from 7 am to 10 pm, for instance, rather than 6:30 am to 11:30 pm. But these are minor matters. On the whole, the tours were good and fairly well organized."

Drinks were served promptly on demand, no matter how often you would call the servant or go to the bar yourself. There was comment and explanation on every sight we sailed by; the acoustic quality of the sound system however was poor, which made it very hard to understand everything. The entertainment program was amusing, but not every act was of the same quality. However one cannot complain too much on a program with a magic show, singing and dancing. The belly dancer was charming and showed some great interaction with the (male) spectators. All in all I certainly would recommend this evening for a night out in Istanbul."

The actual tour time was less than the rest (pick up time, waiting time and carpet sales).I booked a private tour the next day from a different company and that was tailor made for us and not much more expansive than this organised tour with a huge group."

Once we were assembled with others the guide and driver were full of information about sites we were to visit. Our visit to the historical site were very busy as there were four cruise ships in port. However our guides were able to skirt around some of the line ups with prebooked entry tickets. The small air conditioned coaches were comfortable and able to manouver through traffic. Our first impression of Istanbul was \"wow\". This being our first trip to Istanbul we were impressed by the road side flowers that were everywhere. Our historical city tour of two continents was amazing and will be etched in our memory forever. Thanks to Adore Tourism and Tarik Ozaktas for arranging a wonderful day in Istanbul."

Booking and confirmation was efficient.We were picked up at the appointed time.Guide professional and courteous.Princess island amazing BUTTTTTT ....... the horse carriage tour over the island was disastrous.Its something I will never forget! The two horses pulling our carriage were both in near 'death' condition. They were very badly cut from lack of food, lack of care, and a very hard harness that cut deep into their skin as they were skin over bone due to lack of care.. They were actually bleeding from their sores and their cuts...... IFFFFF I had seen this beforehand, I would NEVER ever have taken this tour. At the half way point on a very steep hill, there was a 10min stop, for the horses to be rested and watered......The driver did neither and had a coffee himself,.To be honest, i was disgusted and the worst case of animal abuse to date.This was reported to Adore Travel, and driver carriage advised. If anything was done by them, I have no idea. Even writing this and thinking about it, gives me the shivers.No money or tourism is worth this surely?!It left a very bad taste in my mouth every time I think of Adore and this particular tour."

I was picked up at my hotel on time in a small van and then we picked up 8-10 other people then went to a central meeting location to be distributed into the correct tour group. The full day group was in a large bus and we started at the Spice Market where he had an hour. That was not enough time for me but it was good to have an introduction to it. The Bosphorus curise was interesting and it was nice to see the shoreline and there was narration in English, French and German. After that we went to a restaurant that had a nice view of the city and was actually good food - normally tour food is not so great. Then we crossed the bridge to the Asian side to see a park with a view and a lovely palace. The tour guide was very informative and friendly."

I was in Istanbul recently for the weekend only and wanted to take advantage of using a tour company to get an enjoyable experience from a tour company to give me some insights and make my experience of Istanbul even more interesting.I chose the DOLMABAHCE PALACE & YILDIZ ROYAL GARDEN 1/2 day tour. The guide that we had for this tour was rude - not to me personally - but definitely to some of the guests in our group. As an example when the group were moving between rooms in the Palace one member at the back of the group asked nicely if he wouldn't mind waiting for the full group to arrive into the room before he started explaining what was in that room. He responded by saying \"I've been doing this for 20 years - I think I know what I'm doing\". Which came as a bit of a surprise. The other thing about this tour is that they include a \"fashion show\" as part of the tour - which is just dodgy and seedy and then they take you on to the shop floor to buy the leather jackets from the fashion show at \"amazing\" super discounted prices. I was dumbstruck that a tour that I had paid for the service of were actually forcing me through a fashion show and to try and get me to purchase their goods. If it had been a free tour then I wouldn't have thought much of it - I've had these kind of things thrown at me before, but for a paid tour this was completely unexpected.Also the trip as a half day trip was advised to be 3 hours. In total it was 5 hours because the last 1.5 hours were spent in the fashion show and leather shop. Luckily I wasn't relying on the 3 hours to catch a plane, but it did leave it a little close for me.I did love Istanbul though and seeing the Dolmabahce Palace was a wonderful expereince."

Tucked away off the major tourist center of Sultanahmet, the Kucuk Ayasofya Camii (Little Ayasofya Mosque) is about a 7-8 minute walk from the main square. Built by Justinian in the 6th century, it is said to be the prototype for the much-larger Aya Sofia in Sultanahmet Square.The 7-8 minute walk will take you along well-traveled streets lined with a mix of shops and restaurants catering to both tourists and locals, and a few hotels.It was converted (as the Aya Sofia was) to a mosque after Constantinople fell to Mehmet the Conquerer in 1453. Kucuk Ayasofya is a working mosque; women are required to dress appropriately with headscarves; shoes are removed in the little alcove just inside the entrance - there's a convenient cubby-hole system along one wall to place your shoes until you are ready to leave. You'll see an older ablution fountain with a (non-working) hand pump on the inside - the current washing fountains are outside the structure in the courtyard.Elements of when the Greeks held the city are evident in the 'Greek key' architectural details, and you can climb the short flight of stairs to a platform and overlook the interior. Not many tourists, therefore very peaceful inside. Shades of cream and blue abound, and the interior design work of carvings, tiles, and paintings are not as overwhelming as some of the larger mosques. The cream and blue colors reminded us of Greece; as this was a Greek church for centuries, perhaps this is color scheme was an intentional choice.We can't say for certain if there was an entrance fee - we were so taken in by how lovely the mosque is - we recall leaving a 10 TL each donation (as of June 2016, ~$3.42), but due to our limited understanding of Turkish were not sure if that was an entrance fee or not.In many ways, we found Kucuk Ayasofya more beautiful than the better-known Aya Sofia because it is smaller, much less crowded, and it you can get much closer to see the beautiful tilework and architectural details. And, as long as there are no prayer services, you can sit as long as you like and enjoy the serenity."

It is a beautiful example of a 6th century church, dedicated to 2 Christian Roman soldiers, although all the Byzantine mosaics and frescos were removed in the 16th century when it was converted into an Ottoman mosque. But the beautiful pillars and their intricately carved capitals, and the Greek friezes above them were left undamaged, either by the Ottomans or the more recent renovations. Although technically a museum since the Republic was formed in 1922, it seems to have again become a mosque after renovation, meaning ladies must now cover up and making viewing tricky on a Friday But definitely worth a visit. Make sure you go upstairs (but be careful on worn steps)."

We began our explorations today at the K\u0215\u00e7\u0215k Ayasofya Mosque, built in the Sixth Century by the Byzantine Emperor Justinian as a church honoring Saints Sergius and Bacchus, the Fourth Century Roman Christian martyrs who appeared to the emperor in a dream. Because the \u201cLittle Hagia Sophia,\u201d as it is known, retains the architectural features of the original church, it struck us as an example of the Ottoman practice of re-purposing Christian religious structures, often whitewashing over mosaics and frescoes, rather than tearing churches down to build mosques. Whether this practice demonstrated tolerance or frugality, it was a treat to see the surviving examples of Byzantine art."

I think it is worth going out of one's way to visit because of the Byzantine architecture and the building's history. The red-brick structure features an imposing dome and an irregular octagon shape. Inside, big columns remain from the building's days as a church. Justinian and his wife, Theodora, built the little church at some point between 527 and 536, just before Justinian's massive Aya Sofya went up. The minaret and madrasah, now used for other purposes, date from the church's conversion to a mosque in 1500.The mosque proved to be extremely quiet. Only one other person joined us inside. We took about 10 minutes to look around and then left for the small tea room that occupies part of the former madrasah. The tea was good; the WC proved to be in deplorable condition."

Expect to remove your shoes too, I left mine outside with no issue.It was my first trip to a mosque and I was a little unsure (worried to ignorantly offend if I'm honest), but it is a quiet area away from the hustle and the 'process' for visiting is clearly marked out on helpful signs to allow you to get on with it respectfully.It's a beautiful building and quite old - I specifically visited in order to see the Byzantine frieze that runs beneath the gallery inside. Amazing.It was also a great education.There is no charge for visiting active mosques, but donations are welcome - there is a box for this just after the cloakroom."

Ayasofya is a bit more special because of it's historical background, once being a church and a great location just in between of Topkapi palace and Blue Mosque. I didn't have a chance to go inside, but it's a great place to take a photo."

We were not disappointed. This beautifully proportioned space is decorated minimally compared to the bigger and more visited attractions and is all the more appealing (and more refreshing) for that. The many fewer visitors allow the reasonable chance of photos without the intrusion of the human figure and the possibility to roam all over the building, to the gallery, to the top of the added enclosure etc which allows many viewpoints such that you start to notice things like the edges of vertical surfaces that are sculpted and decorated to look like drawn-back curtains and the fact that the building is not quite true on its axis. The intimacy of the smaller space and the more restrained decoration soon made us warm to this building; maybe we felt it as a bit more European than Eastern, a bit more retaining of its Christian heritage despite its conversion to a mosque? Outside there is almost a cloisters containing the ablutions station with retail outlets offering ceramics, glassware, literature, refreshments etc. and in the nearby streets are some interesting local artists working away in their studios and selling their art. After the hectic confusion and bustle of the larger monuments, this quiet and serene tucked-away jewel of a building is a tonic for wearying sight-seers"

This was the first place we visited on our day tour of the Old City & it was the only place that was quiet & where one could gaze at the beauty of the architecture without crowds of people. This little church was built just before Aya Sophia & was originally covered with gold mosaics, like its big cousin! These were removed by the Ottomans but the graceful lines of the dome & marble columns still make it a place of great beauty. Well worth a visit & a chance to relax far from the madding crowd in the garden."

Good travel books will probably drop a few lines about the existence of this much smaller church from the same period that now operates as a mosque. Little Ayasofia (k\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck ayasofia) is a much smaller temple but its interior is better conserved - you can look at the inscriptions in Greek. The church has an octogonal plan with beautiful columns and wall paintings, and a gallery that provides a great view from a different angle.It is interesting to see how the mirhab (the central piece where the faithful offer their prayers) had been built. Since the church was built without Mecca in mind and the mirhab has to be oriented towards Mecca, the solution was to place it off center.Little Ayasofia (k\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck ayasofia) is located in the Sultanahmed region but removed from the main attractions around its larger sister. No tour buses seem to stop there so you can enjoy a quiet visit. The blocks around the church are a nice place to walk and relax, away from the stressful movement of tourists and street vendors elsewhere."

We loved the hand printing shop - but right next door is a very special jewellery shop. It has the most unusual beautiful handmade jewellery and is not expensive. I bought the most precious ring there and everybody I have shown it to says it the most beautiful ring they have ever seen. I wish I had bought gifts for everyone there.

We have some nice shots of the mosque from outside and the inside is amazing. There is no fee for entering, at least I did not pay, I just wanted to pray.It is worth going especially during sunset time if you just want to enjoy some time chatting with your companion during sipping a hot cup of tea of coffee as you enjoy the scene.

They apparently used some of their construction ideas on this church as a prototype before embarking on the huge Hagia Sophia project, so its worth seeing for that reason. It dates back to the 600 AD era, but is very well restored and is a fully functioning Mosque, so no traces of its early Christian heritage remain, unless you look closely at some of the carved lettering along the balcony edge, which are in Latin and Greek. Some bright spark had the idea of building a railway line in 1870 some two metres form the structure and the resulting vibrations almost destroyed it. But its all been strenghened and shored up and should survive another 1400 years."

Built in the 6th century, it is beautifully preserved just inside the old city walls. In the cloister area outside is the station where worshipers wash themselves before entering the mosque and a small cemetery. The inside of the mosque is tranquil and peaceful with beautiful windows and painted ceilings. The Imam was there to show people around and he insisted that we go upstairs to get a better look. The mosque is carpeted, but under the carpet you can feel the uneven stones that have been worn down over the centuries. After the crowds at other mosques and churches I had visited, this was a pleasant And meaningful interlude. There is no admission, but you will probably want to leave a donation to help with preservation. I highly recommend a visit!"

The stairs up are sometimes broken and the handrail is best irgnored but you can have a totally different perspective on a mosque from the gallery. Since it is a bit off the beaten track, it is not that rushed and you can enjoy the architecture and the beautiful silence more or less alone without the hundreds of (noisy) tourists at the big mosque. It is also situated in a small nice park so a good idea to get some peace of mind back in busy Istanbul.Of course, proper dress code is required."

It was one of the few mosques left in Istanbul which still was floored with individual carpets instead of the wall-to-wall that is in most of the major mosques today. The only thing that bothers me about the \"restorations\" of mosques in Istanbul is that rather than maintaining the historic feel, they tend to repaint in a way that makes the interior look like it's fresh out of the box and a look at the pictures tells me it's happened here too.There's not an official fee but it's good to make a donation.The small madrassah across the way is a lovely quite place to have tea, enjoy the flowers and talk with people who practice and teach traditioal Ottoman crafts."

It was late in the afternoon and it was only me in the building. A very polite man, who was obviously looking after the mosque, invited me to get inside as I was not sure whether I was allowed to. I only had to take my shoes off (I was not asked to cover my head) and then to step inside. I was charmed by what I saw: it was an impressive mixture of two religious cultures. The building is a mosque now but the original architecture has survived remarkably well, not like the original interior decoration. It must have been a beautiful church \u2013 with the elegant two-storey colonnade and walls covered in golden mosaics (like those that survived from this period in Ravenna) and probably frescoes as well. The capitals of the marble columns are splendid and still bear the monograms of Justinian and Theodora. It was interesting to learn that this edifice is even older that one of the present museum Haghia Sophia. It was begun by Justinian and his Empress Theodora in 527, five years before the commencement of the building of Haghia Sofia itself. Likely, the Sains Sergius and Bacchus was a model for St Sophia. Today, it is also known as the Little Haghia Sophia because of its resemblance to the Great Church.SS. Sergius and Bacchus served as a church for nearly 1,000 years after its founding, but then in the first decade of the sixteenth century it was converted into a mosque. SS. Sergius and Bacchus were two Roman soldiers martyred for their espousal of Christianity. The saints were especially dear to Justinian because they saved his life some years before he came to the throne. It was my last day of our five days break in Istanbul and was really glad that I didn\u2019t miss seeing this church. It is just less than a 10 minutes\u2019 walk from the Hippodrome and 5 minutes from our Dara Hotel. The area, where the church is located, is residential and it\u2019s pretty nice to see how people live there. To me this church-mosque is one of the most charming architectural treasures in Istanbul."

The interior is a total aesthetic delight, with every detail harmonising perfectly, and visitors are encouraged to go up to the gallery for more wonderful views and photo opportunities. Although there is no charge, a modest donation of a Lira or two to the mosque via its guardian would be appropriate.Dress code rules applying in smaller mosques. While the larger ones have more detailed information boards and issue plastic bags to carry your shoes around in, smaller mosques are more problematical. From my own observations 1) a woman trying to enter wearing a hat will be turned back \u2013 a shawl or scarf is expected 2) shoes should be taken off before standing on the carpet at the entrance to the mosque \u2013 I saw visitors told off for not doing this. They had reasonably assumed that they only needed to be shoeless once past the door and the prohibition is not made explicitly clear in the mosques with less tourist traffic 3) taking off your shoes and carrying them in your hands is frowned upon (while carrying them in the plastic bags provided in the larger mosques is fine)."

We decided to visit the \"Little Hagia Sophia\" (so called because it was also built by Justinian, along similar lines to the Hagia Sophia) before visiting some of the larger and more famous buildings. It is certainly less spectacular than the Hagia Sophia, but it has something to offer for people who are interested in older buildings. Do not expect original Byzantine architecture, however, as it has been heavily modified over the centuries, most recently to brace it against the vibrations from the railroad which runs right next to the building.For one thing, it is far less crowded, and you can take your time examining the paintings which decorate the upper galleries without feeling pushed or rushed. Although we did not have a language in common, the caretaker ensured that we saw all public parts of the building, by inviting us to climb to the gallery when we otherwise wouldn't have done so.As with all active mosques, you need to take off your shoes before entering, and women are asked to wear a headscarf. There were headscarfs you could borrow just inside the door. There is no charge to visit."

This is one of the greatest treats that the city of Istanbul can offer...It's a quiet, loving, accepting place surrounded by coffee houses and artists' studios. It's the kind of site that allows for a special level of devotion and/or \"special pleading\"--like Gobekli Tepe in Mesopotamia, the Frick Museum in NYC, Santiago De Compostela, and Cerveceria Catalana (for the best tapas in the world) or Sta. Maria Del Mar in Barcelona.\"Kacuk Ayasofya\" was the church of St. Sergius and Bacchus, the Patron Saints of the Military (the Orthodox tradition) for over 1000 years and it is still a place of pilgrimage for Christians, Sufis, poets, and secular humanists--straight and gay--as well as a fully functioning mosque. To accommodate the change from church to mosque, the orientation of the minbar and qibla were shifted off-axis and the altar removed, but this does nothing to detract from the sanctity--or balancing energy--of the place.I should also not that down the street (on a side street, 5 minutes away) is a masterpiece from the great Sinan: the Sokollu Mehmet Pasa Camii, making this a one-two punch of sacred architecture in what is my favorite city in the world: first Hagia Sophia and the Blue Mosque (5 minutes up the hill), then lunch (at \"Cesme\" down the street) and the aforementioned duo of Sokollu Mehmet and Kacuk Ayasoya...followed by \"chai\" in the garden next door. There's a day with a taste of Heaven...It's one of my favorite places in the world. True to Rumi's motto, it is a place to \"Come--whoever you are, Come!\". For any tour of Istanbul, it should be a \"must see\" (and don't forget there's an upstairs area which is perfect for reading and reflection). Enjoy--it still has a great deal to teach us...PS: One of the reviewers below mistakenly suggests that there is a cover charge--there is for the Great Hagia Sophia up the hill (now a museum), but not for this lovely shrine--it is still a place of worship. This little wonder was begun 5 years before its better known neighbor. John Romer pays homage to this \"Camii\" in his wonderful 4-part documentary, BYZANTIUM: THE LOST EMPIRE. Watching that excellent series (on dvd) would give you more than enough information with which to visit this site without a guide and enhance your appreciate of the city as a whole."

In the medrassa area there are now little shops selling crafts and usually with the tradesmen in the shops. Opposite there is a calligraphy bazaar. It is all on a small scale so a nice change from huge monuments and crowds."

This building is in fact older than Hagia Sophia. It made me slightly sad, the sterile way they have worked on the interior, no matter how beautiful the interior is though. It just clashes with all that history.It is a peaceful place though, I was all alone when I visited and afterwards I enjoyed sitting on the benches outside, watching kids playing football. There are also some beatiful Ottoman grave stones around the building."

The former church was dedicated to two Roman soldiers martyred for their faith. The Camii dates from 536. I walked inside and found this place to be a peaceful respite from the outside world. I was all alone and climbed up the very steep stairs to the balcony to get a better view of the interior. There I could see the lovely red and green marble columns. An intricate frieze which is over 1400 years carved in Greek mentions The founders of the church. Outside the mosque is a small cemetery and various shops of artisans where you can buy small articles. There is also a place to stop for tea underneath the trees.A little different than the Blue Mosque, but special in its own way."

The lack of many visitors is a dream after the bustle of the usual tourist sights. An upper gallery from its Christian era (today for female worshippers) gives excellent views down on to the main area of the mosque. Take a tripod to capture the best pictures of the inside. The caretaker is very proud of his building and will happily talk for hours, especially if you can chat to him in Turkish."
