As well as getting you from A to B you get a visual explosion of views no matter where you travel in the harbour. The ferries are old but clean & reliable. They run to a strict timetable & are easily visible with their green & yellow colour. They are well used by locals & tourists alike. It was not expensive either for the convenience, rather than taking your car."

Other cities with harbours should look to Sydney for tips. The service was always on time, was fast and efficient, and really inexpensive. Even without guides, it is still and good way to see the sites."

A wonderful and memorable trip sailing out alongside the iconic Harbour Bridge and Opera House. Beautiful views on both the northern shore suburbs and the Eastern suburbs on the way out to Manley. Manly is well worth a visit too. It has a lovely 'village' feel with great beaches and a fabulous seafood restaurant opposite the Manley terminal (see review for Garfish) I think it is a must-do for anyone visiting Sydney, as the city is all about the harbour and the estuary and this is the perfect way to experience it.."

            "review": "Cheapest way to see Sydney Harbour. You can spend 6AUD for a one-way ferry trip that will take you out into the Harbour where you'll get fantastic views of the Harbour Bridge and Sydney Opera House. Depending on the route you choose you'll get a chance to see Luna Park up close, visit Taronga Zoo or any number of the attractions at Darling Harbour (Madame Tussauds, the aquarium and the Maritime museum to name a few).Just make sure you check the timetables as they don't run 24x7. You'll need an Opal card. They can be bought at the airport, Circular Quay and many newsagents, post offices and supermarket. If you have a smartphone you can download the app and register your card, keep track of the balance and top it up wherever you are. Two important points though, make sure you swipe your Opal card when boarding and again when disembarking or you may be overcharged for your journey. There are signs everywhere reminding you. Also if you need to top up your balance then if you use the app there is a 40AUD minimum top up per card. If you use one of the top up machines at Circular Quay or any of there other ports then you can top up with a minimum of 10AUD per card. And you can register all Opal cards for the family on the one smartphone account."

Opal cards can be purchased at the airport, visitor centres and other places throughout Sydney. Credit top-up machines are located at almost every ferry stop. The Manly ferry gets pretty busy on a weekend. Once a ferry load of passenger has tagged through, the gates close and remaining passengers have to wait for the next ferry. The operators are also very strict about the gate close time and won't open them. Plan your trip and arrive early so you don't get locked out and don't abuse the crew because you get locked out and miss the ferry; they're doing their job and adhering to safety protocols. It's a great service."

A ferry to Watsons Bay followed by walk across to the Gap Heads walkway for spectacular VIEWS , picnic in the park, fush and chips on the wharf or high tea on the verandah of the historic homestead is perfection. Or under the bridge at night in the direction of Balmain past a vibrantly lit Lunar Park ..all the exploring is amazing. Check final ferry times if you ard wanting returns. .I got caught out missing the last ferry back to Circular Quay at 4.45pm from Watsons. .but the spectacular bus ride back to central via Bondi was just as much fun.

Whether it's the ferry between Circluar Quay to Manly, which takes you across the heads, or simple a scoot across from the city to an inner city location like Milson Point or Balmain, there's no better way to experience the harbour just like a local - and just for the cost of a normal commuter trip, covered by the handy Opal card."

It is still a great way to see the Bridge, Opera House, the cruise terminal and a major part of the outer harbour. The last trip we took was marred somewhat by the lack of ticket agents who had just been replaced by ticket machines that worked erratically and had long queues. Single trip becoming a bit expensive but were advised to get a travel card for unlimited travel around Sydney. Still a must do in Sydney but allow time for the dratted ticket machines."

But a couple times I've gotten to the wharf early and tapped on to ensure a spot on the ferry, but people just start cramming toward the entrance. A couple weeks ago a friend and I tried to take the Watsons Bay ferry. We go there 20 min early to ensure our spot, but so many people started coming and pushing and cutting their way through that we didn't even end up getting on. It would've been another 30 min till the next ferry and who knows if we would've been pushed out of that one too. Ended up going on a random other one. Very disappointing."

They are fast and comfortable. Toilets are onboard and I think the ferry that we were on also had a snack bar. The ferry services don't use paper tickets. You need to pirchase an OPAL card and put some cash on it then just 'tap' on and off the ferries and buses. For the tourist the cards are valid for 9 years.

Great photo opportunities of Fort Denison, Sydney Opera House, Shark Island, Luna Park, Sydney Harbour Bridge.....the list goes on and on.If you like a bit of an adventure DO choose a windy day and sit/stand outside on the lower deck (bow end) as you travel toward Manly. The adventure outside on a windy day as the ferry passes through the somewhat notorious \" Sydney Heads\" (the land points of North Head and South Head) gives the brave travellers a good soaking (great on a very hot day but not so great on a cold day) and provides other indoor travellers with great amusement and laughter, along with many oooh's and aaah's. It's advisable if participating in the adventurous lower deck fun to NOT be drinking a hot beverage and /or munching on a doughnut either, unless you really love the salty sea water taste of the waves crashing over the decks and onto your food & drinks. Lots of fun though whether indoors or outdoors and whether windy or not.Highly recommended."

Another favourite is the Darling Harbour 'cruise' - past Luna Park, McMahons Point, Balmain, Darling Harbour - sometimes Cockatoo Island - and again - timing is the thing - try to catch the Sydney skyline lighting up for the evening - twinkling lights on the water. Third favourite - the River Cats up the Parramatta River - historic buildings, plenty of things to see."

Amazed by the majestic Harbour Bridge, look into the waterside residences, mesmerised by the curved rooftops of the Sydney Opera House & the life at Circular Quay.A trip to Sydney will never be complete without a ride on the yellow-green Sydney ferries."

Ferries from circular quay go from there to everywhere across the harbour .. so manly beach , Milson point , tarunga zoo, rose bay, fort denison , darling harbour pyrmont bay etc .. in a nutshell I can avoid sydney peak hour traffic if you're intending to travel by bus or taxi. If you're at walking distance it's all good . But certain destinations outside city centre have to be reached by bus or ferry . Staying close to the quay is a good idea for easy access"

My husband and I used the train to get from our apartment to Circular Quay then used the ferries not only as a mode of transport but as sightseeing vessels too. Most lines have 2 ferries per hour and you get amazing views as you travel by water."

The Manly ferry is a wonderful ride and takes 40 minutes. When you alight from the ferry walk straight across at the pedestrian lights and head down The Corso, a pedestrian walk then when you reach the surf beach walk to the right and that will take you on a scenic level walk to Cabbage Tree Bay. You can have lunch at the restaurant there or coffee and meander past a few shops. When you are ready to go back you follow the same path back. There are many eateries to sample Fish and Chips or try one of the many pubs for lunch - we often eat at the Ivanhoe Hotel you can sit upstairs on the balcony and watch the passing parade on the Corso. Return to the wharf to catch the ferry to return to Circular Quay. Enjoy!"

It's a very long time since I have been on the Manly Ferry and we were fortunate to be at the front of the queue when it came into Circular Quay which enabled us to be first on board and grab a seat at the front, I thought. So much for being a smarty pants, these boats are pointed at both ends and we actually were seated at the stern but this turned out to be to our advantage as we got really good views of the bridge and the Opera House as the ferry pulled away from the Quay. Tip for anyone, if you can board the ferry and find seats facing the railway station you'll get a good view from this position, fantastic for taking photos. However, you'll have to change seats if you want to see were the ferry is going."

The usual way to see a city is by land - we see the \"front\" of everything. Viewing the city from the waterways has given us the \"rear view\" of places and activities. From the heads to the harbour and Manly, around the many harbour coves and beaches, the harbour islands, the Zoo, then the Opera House and spectacularly under the Harbour Bridge, more islands and on to Sydney Olympic Park and the Homebush Bay precinct, then on through the eery mangrove waters to Parramatta. It's impossible in a day. So take a day or a week of days, relax on board the ferries, of many shapes and sizes, from calm waters to rough seas (sometimes). Of course fireworks always look fabulous from the water. We really enjoy the ferry trips."

Also plenty of room on board to sit. They have a cafe and toilets on the ferry. Really great public transport and an awesome way to see Sydney on a sunny day."

We traveled into Circular Quay by train, then by ferry to Taronga Zoo where we got a bus up to the zoo entrance, and completed the return journey all for free as we'd reached our weekly cap!The ferries vary considerably in size and age, but all have more than adequate seating and you can always go on deck to admire the view.

Go up the Parramatta River, over to Watsons Bay for the best fish and chips, across to Balmain or Darling Harbour to see different sides to this beautiful city of Sydney. Or take the family over to Milson's Point to visit our Luna Park.

And if you are planning a visit to Sydney and are a senior check out the opal website and pre-apply and it will only be $2.50 every day!"

If this happens just jump across to the Manly Fast Ferry where there are lots of helpful staff - it's not as iconic but it gets there quicker and is friendlier."

Last week we took a ferry to Manly and return, sitting up front and outside, despite the wind and showers. Truly exhilarating! We even enjoyed the rock and roll as we passed the famed Sydney Heads. For a quieter ride was also took a smaller ferry, heading under the bridge and up the harbour to places like Greenwich and Woolwich. A beautifully scenic way to enjoy the city, and thoroughly recommended. The only problem: the bureaucrats have made it almost impossible to buy tickets. Why does it have to be such a slow, frustrating and difficult process for visitors? At one stage we almost gave up. It was as though the authorities who run the ferry service have systematically tried to discourage tourists from travelling with them."

The view is always lovely on the water and it's a relaxing way to travel. As mentioned in the previous person's review, you need the Opal card which can be bought at many small convenience stores etc. My sister visited from interstate and bought a card and will hang onto it until her next visit, so it won't go to waste. She had to get to the airport to return home and it was super easy to go on the ferry to Circular Quay and then just up the escalator to the train station above the Quay to catch the train to the airport. The trains run very regularly (around every 15 minutes or so?) and the airport is only a short few stops away. All in all the ferries offer a great alternative form of travel in Sydney."

As paper tickets are no longer accepted we had to purchase an \"Opal Card\" which we then used to touch on and off at each stop. The card itself initially had to be loaded with $20 minimum and we did have to top it up another 3 times over the course of our weekend as we only topped up $10 at a time. The most expensive ferry trip was over to Taronga Zoo... $5.45 each way (10 to 15 minute ride, no stops) Most other trips we took which included a number of stops was around the $3.50 mark. The ferries themselves were clean with lots of seating upstairs and down. We chose to sit outside at the front to get the best views and photo opportunities. Overall i think the ferries are a fabulous way of seeing the harbour and all the sights along the way including The Harbor Bridge and The Opera House....there are photo opportunities at every turn."

We travelled on a week day so a weekend might be a bit more crowded, but the ferries run every half hour.

Sydney Harbour is the most spectacular harbour in the world and yes I am biased but I am well travel and therefore also qualified to say this. You can catch a ferry to Luna Park; a fun park on the shores of the harbour and a 5 minute ferry ride. Of course you can also walk there by crossing our famous Harbour Bridge but if time is of the essence a ferry ride is perfect. You can catch a ferry to the Zoo, ride the condola up to the top and then walk down and catch the ferry back to the Quay. You can catch the ferry to Manly Beach for lunch and then back again. That is about a 45min voyage and a beautiful one. Whilst in Manly you can just wander around; there are hundreds of cafes to choose from along the beach front or go to the North Fort display which is a Defence of Sydney display with gun implacements and tunnels used in WWII; and a Memorial Walk of Commemoration for our Soldiers in all wars. There is also a lovely Cafe for lunch and walks with amazing views of our spectacular harbour. You can get there by bus.You can catch a ferry to Parramatta up the Parramatta River. This was the first area settled after they realised the ground of Sydney Cove was not good for growing food. The farms at Parramatta saved the colony from starvation. In those days they used to row a small boat which also had a small sail. Whilst at Parramatta you can see the Old Government House, where the gate house is now a lovely Cafe; Hambley Cottage, lots of small colonial homes that now are now occupied by Law firms, accountants, architects, and medical rooms but the outside of them are original. Parramatta is also a very cosmopolitan city in it's own right and well worth the visit. There are many restaurants alfresco or inside. The ferries however, don't run as frequently to and from Parramatta and you will need to ask when boarding what time they will be available to return to the city. This has a lot to do with the tides in the river. If the ferry is not available the trains or the buses will be. I hope when you come to my city of Sydney you have a wonderful time. It is a beautiful city. The best times are from March to November unless you like the heat of Summer. If that is the case you will enjoy our city all year round although it can get cold, wet and windy in Winter. June, July August. Happy Travels."

The most cost effective way to do it is buy an opal card. You can do this at the newsagency at the ferry wharf."

Like taking the ferry to Taronga Park Zoo and having lunch near the exotic animals or taking a ferry to Parramatta and visiting Old Government House in Parramatta Park. Sure there is a little bit of walking involved from the wharves, but well worth your exploration. Take a ferry to Manly for some fish and chips at the ocean beach, or to Balmain East Wharf for a historic walk up Darling Street to a nice shopping strip with some nice cafes for lunch or dinner. It is really nice to have that Titanic moment when you stand at the bow of the ferry with your arms stretched out and the wind in your hair. Be adventurous and ferry to some new horizons. Great for families and couples alike."

The traditional cream and green ferries are one of the easiest ways to get around the significant points on the Harbour.There are four main types of ferries, the largest are the Circular Quay to Manly ferries which go the length of the harbour, it's a great way see the spectacular waterfront houses and little bays. Some trivia about the names of ferries, Manly ferries tradionally are named after the Northern surf beaches - Narrabeen, Freshwater or Collaroy for instance. Next in size are the Lady Class (named after the wives of Governors). These work heavy usage inner harbour routes like the Circular Quay to Tarronga Zoo. The \"First Fleet\" class are named after the ships of the First Fleet that brought the first convicts and settlers to Australia. These are the backbone of the inner harbour fleet and go to places like Neutral Bay, Mosman and Darling Harbour. The fourth class are the sleek, low profile \"Rivercat\" class, named after Australian female Olympians, they go under the Harbour Bridge and up the Parramatta River to places like the Sydney Olympic venue. Nearly all the ferries run to and from Circular Quay, at the end of the main streets of Sydney. Get advice about ticket types and timetables either at Circular Quay or on the transportnsw.info website. One favourite trip for Sydneysiders is taking a ferry to Rose Bay for a drawn out seafood lunch and swim. No need to worry about parking and the ferry ride back to Circular Quay combats the effects of a fine lunch."

Even if it was a dumb question - the staff need to be understanding that tourists are trying to sort it all out...we heard some overseas tourists being spoken to in a very abrupt manner. Really no need for that! However, do take the ferries - we took our grandchildren (6 & 8) all over the place (now get a Senior's discount)...not only Balmain but Manly beach, Taronga Park and the City Centre (we stayed in Balmain).

            "review": "A love since childhood. I have ridden the Sydney ferries since I can remember. I love it. If you are visiting Sydney, these commuter ferries will give you a great view of Sydney Harbour at a small price. Take the \"Manly Ferry\", a classic ferry ride, and see the length of the harbour. Lots to do in Manly before you jump back on. The trip will take you past the harbour bridge, Opera House, Pinchgut (Fort Denison in the middle of the harbour), past places like Taronga Park Zoo and past the grand North & South Heads of the harbour. Make sure you take the older ferry, it is cheaper and a great experience. There is a fast ferry for a few more dollars. This is fine if you are a commuter or in a hurry. BTW, if the weather is a bit rummy, you may find the Manly ferry a wild ride near the heads. If this sounds a little too adventurous, there are lots of ferry options in safe waters near the bridge. Another great option is to take the cat (ferry) to Parramatta and see a completely different view of the harbour."

If there is a better way of getting around Sydney without stress and tearing your hair out in traffic jams, then I've yet to find it.From the airport (or other destinations in NSW) simply catch the train to Central station then get on any of the City Circle line trains for a quick 3 stop trip to Circular Quay and you will see the Ferry terminals a few minutes walk away, with the Harbour Bridge to your left and the Opera House to your right.By far the most popular route is the famous Manly Ferry, which always seems packed with tourists no matter which day of the year you travel on it, but if you have time to spare sailing around on the Harbour, try a trip to one of the other beautiful places, such as Watsons Bay, Neutral Bay, Darling Harbour, or my favourite (apart from Manly) Mosman Bay.If you want a longer trip just to sightsee from the Ferry, then a trip to Parramatta is a good way of passing the time of day.There are various ticket prices ranging from concessions to return trips so it's advisable to check with Sydney Transport about your options before you go."

We loved touring by ferry, hopping on and off. Taking the long ride out to Manly and strolling along Manly beach, or taking the ferry around the harbor and hopping on and off at places like Luna Park, which is a very unusual 50's style park, with no admission charge, and lots of things to see. The rides can be a bit pricy, if you can't justify the very reasonably priced season pass, but it's a fun place to stroll. And from there, you can take the ferry or the subway back across the bridge.

Have been to Manly many times in the past, always found it a great place to go to - away from the city - just a half hour ferry trip, which is so beautiful and enjoyable as you get to experience a fair bit of the beautiful Sydney harbour - for visitors from interstate or overseas, you definitely have to visit manly before you leave Sydney.Anyways haven't been to Manly for many years, so while my husband and I were spending a weekend in the city (Sydney) for Vivid - we took the ferry trip to manly beach, was so beautiful loads of restaurants, some shops, and an amazing quiet beach to relax. Next time we spend a weekend in the city we are going to end staying at Manly.We are so blessed to live in this beautiful part of Australia Sydney."

Passing by the Opera House, Fort Denison and Shark Island gives you a seagulls eye view of these historic landmarks. I prefer the older ferries to the hydrofoils as the trip is slower and allows passenger the advantage of riding on the outside deck. For me rough weather is a bonus but if you dislike getting wet stay in the cabin."

This is a delightful half hour of bliss, just chugging across the harbour, watching the scenery slide by. Of course, the most exciting section of this iconic ferry trip, is crossing the Heads, which is where the entrance to Sudney Harbour is. Sometimes the swell coming in through the Heads can turn a placid harbour ride into a wild, bucking, rolling ride for that 5 minute section across the Heads. So for anyone visiting Sydney, head to Circular Quay, wharf 4. Your ferry leaves every half hour to Manly \"seven miles from Sydney & a thousand miles from care\"."

And as long as it's not raining, you can sit outside and enjoy the fresh sea breeze of the Pacific Ocean as it rolls into Sydney, between the North and South Heads.There are many commercial floating wine and dine cruisers, but taking making your own simple local adventure can be fun too.When the height of a Sydney Summer hits, we often take a ferry around the harbour just to relax, cool off and enjoy the sunset views over the Bridge and the Opera House."

The lady who served us managed to dispense the requested tickets without looking at us once, cracking a smile or uttering a word. She was far too busy searching the internet on her mobile phone, I could see through the glass she was on Toni & Guys website. As a manager of a small office, if one of my staff was so rude to a customer they wouldn't be working for me for much longer. It might seem bit petty but I found it exceptionally rude."

What i strongly suggest is to get an Opal Card prior to coming to Australia, or to pick one up at one of the authorized service centers. Do a Google search for \"opal card\". With such a card you will get free travel after 8 trips in one week across all different travel options that accept the Opal Card. The nost unbeatable deal I have seen anywhere.

Saturday's just as bad. So sit back & enjoy the harbour ride on a Manly Ferry. One of the best Harbours in the world. Breath taking on a sunny day. Keep your eyes open may see a fairy penguin."

If you're here on a Sunday then it will be extremely cheap (As of 2016, Sunday travel is capped at $2.50 for all ferry, rail, and bus trips you take). Top recommendation would be the ferry from Circular Quay to Manly as it takes you through some of the most scenic parts of the Harbour including around the Opera House. A short walk in Manly and you can find restaurants, cafes, coffee, and beaches. Hop back on the ferry to return to the city. A short blast ferry trip would be the F4 line. It is a loop that will take you from Circular Quay to Darling Harbour and back. This means you travel past the Opera House and under the Harbour Bridge. This will get you to Darling Harbour in about 30 minutes. You can either walk back through the city to your next destination, or stay on the ferry another 30 minutes to return to Circular Quay. If you plan to visit the Zoo, then the best way from the city is the ferry anyway - and you'll get great views of the Opera House and middle Harbour on the way."

With free wifi on the Rivercat, clear signage and display boards, upgraded pontoons, great and comfortable seating right at the front of the craft out in the open air, it's perfect for when you have a bit more time to take in the scenery. Just remember to check the tides and timetables if you are planning to head all the way into Parramatta that at low tide they will make you board a bus at Rydalmere to make the last leg of the journey.

We only waited a few minutes before the ferry arrived and within a very short while we were alighting at Circular Quay. When we were ready to reclaim the car,we just caught another ferry back. Staff are always helpful and friendly, even when this infrequent ferry user asks what might seem like silly questions, and seeing a more elderly person, they are always willing to offer a helping hand for me to board and disembark....one lad assured me that it was much easier to help me because of the paperwork he'd have to fill in if I fell into the water!

Some of the ferry terminals are quaint - a favourite of mine is Greenwich up against a rocky peninsula."

No bars or food concessions so bring your own water to drink. Sit on the top for the best views or out on the deck if you like wind. Spectacular ride - goes right past the opera house and under the \"coat hanger\" bridge on way to Darling Harbor - where else in the world can you get a ride like this for around $6.00 u.s. money. The best value in Sydney. Don't miss it!"

Catching the Kirribilli Ferry to Vivid is a magical way to see the caleidoscope of colours and patterns of the Sydney Opera House, Harbour Bridge, Museum of Modern Art and Circular Quay. You can catch the train to Milson's Point train station and walk down to Kirribilli Wharf. You are required to purchase an Opal card online or at an outlet such as a supermarket to tap on and tap off to get on and off the ferry. During Vivid 27 May-18 June the ferries are lit up with colourful animals such as rhinoceros, turtles and platypus. We deliberately took an indirect route to Circular Quay to see the harbour. We stopped at North Sydney, Neutral Bay, Kurraba Point, Kirribilli again and then Circular Quay. Best viewing is outside at the front of the ferry. You get a wonderful view of the brilliantly lit up Harbour Bridge and Luna Park. The ferry deliberately detoured to the Opera House to spend some time soaking in the magnificent indigenous patterns,colours and sealife. After seeing the visual feast at Vivid the return journey is by Circular Quay. Waiting for the ferry gives you a fantastic view of the Opera House without the crowds with a seat. A magical night!"

Most ferries take you to areas with a few shops and somewhere to eat. You get some great views of the harbour and always see something new or interesting like some navy ships or cruise ships."

It was about a 17 minute journey from Circular Quay to Watsons Bay with one stop at Rose Bay enroute. Just beware, not all queuing ticketed passengers were allowed to board the ferry so allow yourself plenty of time so that you don't have to wait for the next ferry. Safety was well considered on the ferry especially where children were concerned."

We have been to Sydney a few times and this time we bought ourselves a pre-paid Opal card which allows you to use all the public transport including the ferries. The brilliant thing about the Opal card is that the maximum you will be charged for any one day is around $7.00. We went from Circular Quay to Manly the first day so got great views of the opera house, Fort Dennison and the bridge. The next day we took the ferry all the way to Parramatta which was lovely. (Although the last bit was through industrial areas). Then we caught the train back. That night we traveled from Circular Quay to Darling harbour which gave great views of the lights of the city. You can pick up the Opal cards at the main stations and at 7/11 dairies."

Purchase an Opal card and once you spend $15 in fares the rest of the day is free. Basically $15 gets you on and off public transport around Sydney for the whole day unlimited times. We caught the Sydney ferry system to get from Circular Quay around the harbour over to Paddy's Markets and to the Zoo. Both times we started at Circular Quay and it was extremely easy to understand the timetables, where to get the right ferry and any questions we had were fielded by the staff at the booths. The ferries go all over the Harbour and around the foreshores offering a cheap and effective way to see all the sights from the water. The ferries offer an excellent viewing of the big sights like the Sydney Harbour Bridge and Opera House. The Bridge is amazing from the boat as it just dwarfs everything in the harbour. The Ferry system is also a good way to get to Lunar Park, the Casino and Darlington Harbour saving a lot of time on the roads. During busy periods (before/ after work) we noticed the ferries could be quite busy however we had no issues finding a seat."

This became quite dangerous as many pushing. Maybe because this is family cheap fare day, with many, many, families lots of kids and strollers.

It can be a bit if a squash getting on and off, just like a train at peak hour and do be careful with young children. (We saw one fall in the water from a pier next to a ferry) However, if you plan your day you can have a magnificent time seeing all the harbourside ports of call.

Last time we went towards Parramatta exit in Homebush to go back to Circular quay because that was only option if you want to get to the circular Quay.

To get to the ferries we had a 5 min walk to Town Hall Station to catch a train to Circular Quay. You come out of a tunnel and the Opera House is right there its so lovely! TIP- if you buy an OPAL card your train travel can be paid using this and also your ferry trip (it is a marginally cheaper than just buyng a ferry trip) but the real bonus is once you have spent $15 all your travel for the rest of he day is free. A ferry trip to Manly return was just over $14 for an adult (and $11 tot he zoo) so all the rest of the travel that day was free. Quite a saving and much more convenient just tapping on and off as we went. The trip on the ferry on the harbour is so efficient, they run on time and the view is amazing. The only way to travel."

I believe they are available at some corner stores and online or at major ferry stops.There were toilets on all ferries we went on, so that is helpful with the kids....

A Darling Harbour ferry goes past the new Berangaroo waterfront with modernised wharves and old 3 mastered wooden ships.Or go up to river on a river cat, past Cockatoo Island, have lunch and return later.Any or all of these trips I can highly recommend - sit back relax and enjoy the harbour.All tickets available at Circular Quay, with timetables and length of ferry trips available."

The ferry drops you off right at the Maritime Museum at Darling Harbour and you should plan on spending a couple of hours walking around this additional up and coming development area in Sydney. For another one of a kind experience, you could check out a movie at the world's largest IMAX screen, located right in Darling Harbour.

Pinchgut, Double Bay, Darling Harbour, Cockatoo Island, Watsons Bay, the Zoo.... on a beautiful day it's all quite amazing. Living on the Northern beaches my favourite way into town.... avoiding the exorbitant parking costs........ park at Old Cremorne ( free street parking, ferry stop 5 minutes ) or take a beautiful 20 minute scenic water side walk around to Cremorne Point itself and it's only 5 minutes across to Circular quay..... then nearly everything you could want to see is within walking or short bus. distance..........enjoy magical Sydney and it's harbour. If your'e an Australian senior and have an Opal card all this for $2.50.00 a day."

Great ferries and great Harbour but by geez they need to delegate a bit of responsibility to direct patrons and to advise what is going on when passengers are preparing to board. Its a bit of a rabble and it is possible to check in with Opal card only to find that too many passengers onboard and you have to wait another half an hour with no way of backing out once past the scanning breaks. They should count heads as they go through and prevent entry once maximum numbers are reached for the size of the vessel, giving a chance to cancel. Wake up Sydney Ferries, this is an international tourist destination."

Get the Zoo ferry and walk east to the point, or the Mosman ferry and walk west along the coast. Or go up the Parramatta River and have lunch at the end of the trip. The fast ferry to Manly has a bar, and sunset on the harbour with a glass of wine is not to be missed. Even more exciting when there's a big sea as you cross the Heads! Enjoy!"

They gave a different view of all the famous places in Sydney and the service and efficiency of the staff was always spot on.

Another trip I'd recommend is to Watsons Bay - this is where I go to lay on the sand (great if like me you're not so keen on the waves - just don't tell everyone!) and you can enjoy most of the landmarks and photo opps as on the Manly ferry."

My favourites are the Mosman ferry, about an hour there and back, the ferry to the Zoo, and the Manly ferry. If the weather is nice you can easily spend the day at Manly- have a swim at the surf beach at the end of the Corso(pedestrian walk from the ferry to the other end of Manly), have some fish and chips, wander around."

We take our toddler granddaughter out with us on many of these trips and as we use a buggy for her, I have always found the ferry staff very helpful especially on the Parramatta run and the Double Bay run. I can't see why people would pay huge amounts to use private ferries and half day cruises etc, when Sydney Ferries covers all the places you would want to see.

Great ride and plenty to see from all decks. If you love a bit of history, these old vessels will really get you in. Having studied to be a Master V class skipper and worked as a deckhand, my old friend and skipper brought to Melbourne the Lady Cutler, who worked the \"Harbour\" for many years. I guess there is nothing like being on the water, and for a meager seven odd dollars, (One way)where else could you be entertained for that price?"

I sat through 2 ferries that were listed on the passenger board to be due to depart for the zoo in 3 minutes. However, without any further notice, the ferries arrived, unloaded the passengers, and then left empty, without boarding on any new passengers.The passenger board was updated for the next ferry arrival. Over an hour was lost waiting for the 3rd ferry, that actually boarded passengers to go to the zoo. After complaining about this to one of the locals, I was told to never take the yellow colored local ferries, but to only take the high speed, which look like a white catamaran. You have to go to any of the ticket booths that sell the high speed tickets."

Dinner if you wish.Research the ferry timetables in fine detail, allowing time for visits and connection times at Circular Quay.Get yourself an OPAL card for seamless access to the ferries.I guarantee you'll have a wonderful experience on Sydney Harbour - my harbour.OMG - I want to get on that beautiful harbour tomorrow!!"

Particularly after a storm when half way, where the swell and currents intersect mid stream.. Big squeals from the girls. Fun!National Park to explore on arrival as a bonus. Harbour and boat rides are always enjoyed by everyone."

The waves coming thru the head lands made it a more exciting trip than normal! The ferry was bobbing around up and down, side to side and the funniest thing was watching the excitement of the tourists who had never experienced this before. Sydney ferries is a wonderful way to get around Sydney in one of the most beautiful harbours in the world!"

There are sure to be day pass type tickets so donlt restrict yourself to the Sydney Manly service. Try also the Rivercat service to Parramatta, taking in all the upper harbour spots. Another great trip is the ferry Circular Quay to Watsons Bay. You can walk south to Bondi, but have a map handy as it is not possibly to \"hug\" the coast for this walk. Alternatively take the bus service Watsons Bay to Bondi. If you have time left in your day, now walk the coast walk Bondi to Coogee; takes between one and two hours with fabulous coastal scenery. Plenty of coffee shops and eateries at Coogee before you can bus it back to the city."

The journey there and back was excellent - 18 minutes each way, quick entry and exit. The boat was very clean; the crew were great and it was around $8.50 each way.My only complaint is the lack of Opal Card facilities. It makes no sense at all that the only transport card in NSW is not accepted on these boats! Fix this and I would give you 5 star rating."

I take the Woolwich to Circular Quay service 2-3 days a week and never tire of the great scenery. Stopping at Greenwich, Birchgrove and Balmain you get a majestic view of the new city precinct of Barangaroo (Which used to be a retired wharf) and then under the coat hanger; aka Sydney Harbour Bridge and past the Sydney Opera House into Circular Quay. During cruising season there will likely be a cruise ship moored at West Circular Quay.Your ferry crews are friendly and helpful. Listen for their announcements at Circular Quay to get a flavour of Aussie Humour.Recently on a trip home from Circular Quay the deck hand who opens the gate to let you on gave his variation of greeting starting with \"This is not the ferry to Portofino but it is going to Cockatoo Island, stopping at Balmain, Birchgrove, Greenwich, Woolwich and then Cockatoo Island\".There are plenty of destinations to choose from; including Taronga Park Zoo, Watsons Bay, and of course Manly.You can't beat a ferry!"

As part of the NSW transport system their timetable is integrated with that of the buses so you get off the ferry and at most points will find a bus waiting to take you inland. Also, purchase of the ubiquitous Opal card means that you tap on and tap off for both transport modes so no need to worry about purchasing tickets - as long as you keep the card topped up! If you are using them to tie in with onwards journeys the terminus at Central Quay is a 5 minute walk from the main rail station.In addition to the practicality they are one of the best ways of seeing Sydney harbour and it is always a buzz to pull into Central Quay between the Harbour bridge to your right and the Opera House to your left."

            "review": "The only way to become a Sydney-sider, replete with shades and take-our capucchino. I have, as most Sydney-siders do as well, a love affair with the crushed sapphire liquid expanse of the harbour. It girds the city like a liquid lover, a staged tableaux orchestrated by the beauty of its surrounding suburbs. No trip to Sydney is complete without clambering aboard one of these picture-postcard, green & yellow ferries that ply their trade as they have for a century- and- a- half. Why not join me and the rest of the 14 million people who criss-cross the harbour annually, chugging out from mommy-central-hub of Circular Quay to head west up the Parramatta River (known as the Parra), or north on the legendary voyage to Manly or east to Watsons Bay. When the femme and i want to drink and dine in Balmain, shop in Double Bay, sight-see Taronga Zoo with the wee munchkins or glamp at Cockatoo Island, the Sydney Ferries are the way to go. Ditch the car. I am fascinated by the variety and array of ferries, all 28 of them, some stately old dames called \"schoolers\", others called First Fleet models, to the sleek, fast catamarans that glide the river and harbour... connecting all of watery Sydney with 29 wharves across 37 kms of harbour. So, put on your shades, baby, settle back on the upper deck, alfresco and soak up the cheapest , coolest and quintessetionally best local experience.Check out the following Routes: Manly. Known charmingly as \"seven miles from Sydney, a thousand miles from care\" is an easy target via the Manly ferry. It's a unique thrill... the soothing chug of the motors... the tranquil churn of the BIG BLUe beneath... the spectacle vistas passing by all encased in the smug serenity of knowing that only in Sydney can you make this run. If adrenalin is your mistress, then choose an inclement day fraught with strong winds and experience the roller-coaster ride to be had crossing infront of the Heads.Parramatta. Skip the congested 23 kms of noisy highway between the CBD and here by taking the sexy option of zooming from Circular Quay along the backwaters by a sleek, super-fast RverCat catamaran for a one-hour relaxed journey. Mosman.... Getting close and personal with this historic and beautiful enclave is best done with a ferry that glides past the gorgeous harbour real-estate, Cremorn Point, Taronga Zoo, South Mosman, Old Cremorn and finally the queen-in-residence, Mosman Bay. You will spot the difference especially seeing how the other half of Sydney lives. Its very posh, expensive and gloriously enriched by exceptional historic architectural piles of sandstone magic. Cockatoo Island.... Named after the squawky sulpher-crested parrots who lord it in the skies over Sydney at high decibel sounds. This is Sydney's largest harbour island, 18 hectares in size and boasts the premier glamping site in and hosts The BIENNALE while still out-wowing the art showings. The ferry ride is a wonderful glide past iconic places in Sydney. Pack a picnic and enjoy the bounty that this magic spot offers. Darling Harbour..... only a 20- minute riding under the beautiful Harbour Bridge across from the Opera House via the gourmet village of Balmain with its nexus of eateries , bars and cafes bringing you to the Entertainment Quarter, Imax Theatre, Sydney Aquarium Wildflower World, Chinese Gardens , Madame Tussors, and the panoply of restaurants in Cockle Bay and King Street Wharf. Watsons Bay..... this is the ride to \"the long lunch\" destination. Its the most refreshing experience by ferry in terms of passing beauty and the culinary options of fish and chips or a slap-up-do with wine to accompany this iconic kiss- of- beauty location. I would recommend a gentle walk apres your indulgences, to nearby Lady Beach, where wowsers beware: there is a legal nude beach. Always carry a towel my good mother advised. Enjoy."

Even the Thames Clippers which are far more of a commuter experience and run by local authorities in London have a bar selling wine and beer. Well just a thought. I guess they won't get any more travelers but they might make a bit more profit."

This service is cost effective and gives you a new perspective on the Harbour and Parramatta River.We recently took our three grandchildren with uis on a visit to Manly from the Quay and the three of them loved it, although we had to restrain the 6 year old from leaning over the rail! But that's just what kids do, I know I did it to my parents.All in all, a fantastic asset to the city and to the people of Sydney."

During my time in Sydney, I used the ferries on a regular basis to get to the north side and to visit Parramatta, Olympic Park, Manley, Darling Harbour etc. Being in the middle of Sydney Harbour bobbing up and down with one of the best 360\u00ba views in the world, will forever be one of my most cherished memories of Sydney.

Easy to use but keep an eye on your card if your credit is too low you cannot get on without topping up your card as they have just gone ticketless. Ferries really easy to use, choose your destination see when the ferry is departing on which quay and jump on and off. Best news is any journey on a Sunday is fixed at 2 dollars 50, the same for the buses. So if you are going to visit places further afield like Manley go Sunday. The ferries are very reliable and come on time with quick turnaround. Seating is inside and outside perfect for the tourist photos of the harbour bridge and opera house. We used the ferries for Manley, Watsons Bay and a quick trip to Darling Harbour. The Opel card you purchase for the great ferries can also be used on the bus services to Bondi etc."

The locals take these old ferries for granted as they are used for public transportation on the Opal Card system and plenty use them from little piers and the big Manly pier to get to work at Circular Quay and nearby. So if you avoid the rush hour crowd, and you are not unlucky to get a big swell or pelting rain, sit outside and enjoy the view as you go past the Opera House and Harbour Bridge and visit a jetty or a pier. The frequency of some services, including the one to the Zoo, could be better but simple planning will fix that. The view coming into Taronga Zoo is fabulous and the skyrail up is just great and that part is free until you want to enter the zoo itself."

A few trip you will decide to do are only accessible from Circular Quay but the Darling Harbour ferry will take you.

It is really quick if you aim at going at Manly (and its beaches) as the roads are really busy.On sundays the price for any transportation is reduced to 2,5 dollars if i am not wrong... Anyway you have to get an OPAL CARD. You put some money on it and never pay over something like 15 dollars a day even if you get on many trips that worth each something like 6 dollars...Short distance are costing something like 3 dollars...Generally no change available at the bus driver and please never ask him something when he/ she drives !! That's not Paris"

Lots of ferry destinations , good time to go is after peak hour rush and if possible in good weather so you can sit outside and take in all the views. What ever the destination , plan to get off and have either a look around ,swim at some points , shop in others, or just walk some of the tracks , then have lunch and the back to the city. Most points like the Zoo will take all day , Parramatta is also an all day trip> Manly ,the beach ,Watsons . bay is the Gap and walks , Balmain , shops and restaurants, Milsons point ,shop and Luna Park. Darling harbour is a short trip under the bridge to shops and food area around the harbour front."

Despite the information boards saying that a service was due in a few minutes, the reality was this was a Sunday, the sun was shining, it was holiday time and all the boats were packed. So two services decided to miss out our stop and we only found out when we pressed the Information Button and spoke to an operative that was unaware of the problem.Worse was to follow as we decided to head \u201cup stream\u201d to Paramatta, after all we were travellers and it seemed like a good idea at the time. Indeed the journey inland was good, only to find when we got there, that the next two ferries were full. We were given boarding cards and told to wait an hour for the next available service.We caught up with a guy from Lancashire and had a bit of banter and eventually arrived @ Circular Quay three hours later than we intended. BUT the fantastic views from the front of the CAT as we came through Darling Harbour and underneath the iconic Sydney Harbour Bridge, made up for the delay.We did use the ferry service during the week and no problem what so ever. The boats were on time and had plenty of room. So if I was to give you any advice it would be to expect problems at weekends when half of Sydney, plus tourists like me decide it would be fun to mess around on boats."

A ferry ride is almost mandatory for any visitor to Sydney who wishes to gain an authentic feeling for how this city started, developed and continues to breathe life into its inhabitants. There are many trips to choose from, but the trip to Manly is arguably the most impressive, offering a lengthy ride almost to the heads of the harbour and swimming opportunities at the other end. The old ferries are still in use and give a taste of how Sydneysiders have travelled the harbour over many decades, for work and pleasure. Don't forget to give yourself time to buy a ticket or top up the Opel card that is now increasingly used by commuters for public transport in Sydney."

Little did we know that it was a cheap Sunday deal and every one in Sydney (just about) was using them. Very confusing experience for us as we figured out how it all worked. Staff however were very helpful and patient with us. The behaviour of so many fellow passengers was disgusting as they pushed to get on. We have never experienced such rudeness when using public transport. Our 11 year old son was squished near to being frightened as the people behind swelled to get on board. It was frustrating that Sydney Ferries does nothing to manage this when obviously it was needed. Other passengers also visiting were equally alarmed and concerned. It was outright dangerous. Surely it would not be so hard to install temporary measures and more staff to manage the large amount of passengers on these special days. Having said that, our other experiences once the crowds had settled down were easy and as expected. It is a lovely experience to ride the waters to move around the Harbor. In our time there we took a Ferry to Watsons Bay, Manly, Cockatoo Island, Darling Harbor and Lunar Park."

( rail, bus, light rail and ferry) They told us we could travel to the Blue mountains or Wollongong on the ticket also. So the cost to travel on the harbour was fantastic. We used the ticket to access Taronga Zoo and on another day all the way tp visit Manly. So we were sure of great visual of the Opera House and Fort Denison and many other sights on the harbour."

You can purchase an Opal card from many retailers (we got ours at a local seven eleven store) and can top it up with however many dollars you think that you will need. We averaged out at about $10 a day each. You tap the opal card on at the start of a journey and off at the end (you don't need to tap off on the Manly ferries) and the amount of the journey is deducted. If you spend over $15 a day - the amount is capped at $15, On Sundays, the amount is capped at $2.50 which makes Sunday travel especially good value. You can use the cards on all of the public transport - not just the ferries. But the ferries are particularly great value as the views of the harbour are so good.They are very well run; efficient and a great way of getting around. One word of warning - when we were on our way back from Watsons Bay it was really busy. There were people still in the queue and spaces on the ferry but the gates were shut and people appeared to be left behind. It seemed that being on time was more important than taking everyone who was there!"

There was plenty of room both directions for me up there, and I found it easy to select a seat on the aisle. If you sit facing left as you depart the harbor, you'll get a stunning view of the bridge ... a little hard to photograph depending on the shutter speed of your camera, given boat motion, but not impossible. I did not get wet although signs warned of this.If you are likewise going to the Zoo, keep an eye on departure times. The Ferry will not wait! And when you get off at the Zoo, go right on in to take the Sky Taxi (Ferry ticket includes entrance fee) to get in ... consider leaving from the Harbor side of the view instead of waiting in the long lines at end of business when you depart."

Sydney ferries are the best way to explore this huge harbour and you can catch a ferry, have lunch at a \"pub\", wander around the area and then return at your leisure. The majority run from Circular Quary, accessable by train and are cheap and regular. Take the ride to Parramatta past the 2000 Olympic Stadium and explore the suburbs to the west of the CBD with a return trip included in the cheap price. Enjoy the ferry ride to Taronga zoo, then catch the cablecar to the top of the hill and spend the day walking downhill through the zoo and back to the ferry home. Sydney ferries are really good."

If you are a tourist, there are many ways to get around the harbour, but for the cost of a local ferry (a form of public transport here), and even using your 'opal' transport card, you can get a local ferry, sit outside in the sun, and have a glorious harbour tour while also getting to your destination. The ferries run frequently, are easy to find, cheap, and if you take the ferry back to Sydney around sunset, you even get a sunset harbour view! So worth it!"

I took the Circular Quay to Manly ferry as well as the Circular Quay to Taronga Zoo ferry. The ferries are a bit on the slow side, but it serves its purpose for visitors who wish to take pictures of Sydney Harbour. The ferries are stable though and do seem to be on time. The ferries themselves are old and could definitely use an upgrade. The ferries did seem to be fairly clean though. The restrooms/toilets were clean.Food options are horrible though. There is an on-board station that sells food, but it looked like the pies and other food items have sat there for days.I would definitely suggest taking the ferry to Taronga Zoo as it gives you a great view of Sydney Harbour and it drops you off extremely close to the entrance of the zoo. The ferries probably won't be the best option for regular commuters, but it's a great choice for tourists."

There's no crashing waves upon a nearby beach simply because there isn't one! It's a harbour village complete with four operational ferry wharves. Balmain is actually where Sydney ferries end their shifts and dock for the night at Mort Bay, home to Sydney Ports Authority. Unbeknown to the thousands of ferry commuters using their services each day, their history harks back to Sydney's first years as a fledgling settlement when much smaller ferries were essential to move workers as well as cargo between the numerous rocky outcrops of this burgeoning trading town. Our ferries have changed according to this harbour city's needs over the years. But still play an essential role in it's every day movements of todays' workers."

Our first trip was the compulsory ride across the heads to Manly and all of it's wonders - pedestrian shopping precinct, local pubs, restaurants and of course the beach. The walk around to Shelly Beach was a hidden gem.Next we went to Cockatoo Island and discovered an insight into the convict days, some grand old houses and the best placed tennis court I have ever seen.The next day found us on the harbour again this time on our way to Watson's Bay to enjoy a wonderful lunch of fish & chips at the local pub. The view of the houses facing the harbour were amazing. We explored the walk along the coast on the other side of Watson's Bay and saw the amazing view of the Gap and the cliff face. You also get a good view of the heads from here.Our final trip was an entirely different flavour. Even the ferry was of a different variety - a catamaran because it was to take us up the Parramatta river all the way to Parramatta. It was amazing to see just how big this harbour is and all the bays and inlets along the way. The lifestyle afforded to the residents along the way was very enviable indeed, while Parramatta was an interesting destination in itself. The only negative is that the quay could be a lot nicer, it's a bit tired and desperately needs an update. However most of the ferries are in good condition."

Dunbar House at Watsons Bay is also delightful.

My favourite is the ferry to Manly which swings past the opera house and Lady Macquarie's chair and Garden island but also provides views of the bridge. And it takes you to Manly for all it has to offer. Take the train or bus to Circular Quay and the ferry terminal is there. Walk around the quay and enjoy and ice-cream and the buskers, too."

Manly itself is a great tourist destination, but the journey there in the ferry trip is just awesome. Take in the majesty of the iconic Opera House and Harbour Bridge and pass by some of the great areas of Sydney including hectares of National Park within cooee of the city centre. Pass by Nielsen Parks iconic harbour beach, Watson Bay (Another journey worth taking) and past the heads which can be quite adventurous if there is a big Eastern swell coming through. If in Sydney you must get out on the harbour, and this us one of the easiest ways to experience it."

The price was only a few dollar, for which we got a ride of over an hour, ending up going under the harbour bridge and past the Opera House. Well worth the minimal cost."

On Sundays, the maximum deduction is $2.50, but the ferries can be very crowded then.For the SYD Harbor Bridge Walk - You can do the Pylon Lookout, then continue on to walk across the bridge. Have lunch at Ripples (water view restaurant). Take the ferry (or train) from Milsons Point back to Circular Quay.Or do it in reverse:Take ferry or train from CQ to Milson's Point. Walk across bridge to Pylon Lookout. Finish the walk and have lunch in The Rocks.It is a 6 minute ferry ride.Manley - Ride the ferry from CQ to Manley. It is a 30 minute ride. Taronga Zoo - Ride ferry from CQ to the Taronga Zoo. Then ride the Sky Safari to the Upper zoo entrance. It is a 12 minute ferry ride.Darling Harbor - Ride ferry from CQ to Darling Harbor. It makes quick stops at Milsons Point, McMahons Point & Balmain East. It is a 26 minute ferry ride, which can be done in either direction.The ferry from CQ to Milsons Point and also the ride from Milsons Point to McMahons Point provide great photos of both the bridge and the Opera House and are also excellent night time photos when both are lit up.All of these rides glide past the Opera House for good views from the water.

The Sydney Ferry (including Buses and Trains) rock!\nThe ferries glide across Sydney's Harbour taking visitors practically near and far and if your destination is inland a bus is usually waiting which will complete the journey all under one efficient and economical pass- the Opal Pass. Buy it and cruise the world of Sydney. Highly recommended."

Whether you go on a calm, sunny day and sit outside taking photos of the beautiful harbour (probably most people's preferred option) or go on a windy, rainy day and crash and roll your way across the \"heads\" to or from Manly, sitting outside with the ocean spray needling your skin or inside watching the water, then the sky, then the water... This is one of the cheapest and most scenic ferry rides in the world.You get to see most of Sydney Harbour's iconic landmarks and end up in the city at circular quay at one end or Manly at the other, either of which is full of things to do.It's roughly half an hour each way, you can eat and drink on board (there is a kiosk, but I don't think it's open on every trip?) and there's even wifi so the kids don't have to look up at the wonders passing them by.We are locals and this is our preferred way of getting into the city bar none."

Using the ferries to navigate around Sydney hot spots was not only easy, but well priced with some of the best views of downtown, the harbor bridge and Sydney Opera House. Sturdy yellow ferries transport passengers to and from Darling Harbor restaurants and the Maritime Museum, Circle Quay by the Opera House, Taronga Zoo, Fort Denison, Kirribilli, Manly Beach and dozens of other locations. They run on schedule at $2.50/person all day on Sunday no matter how many stops or how far you go. Some of our best photos of the bridge and Opera House were from the ferries, day and night. Plus the skill of the captains and deckhands in maneuvering and docking was a pleasure to watch in and of itself. If you are using an Opal card for bus, light rail and train transportation in Sydney, you can also use it to pay your fee for the ferries. (The maximum transportation fee total for any one day Mon-Sat on Opal-paid transportation is $15/person, whatever the mode of transportation and whatever the distance.) Be sure to Tap On AND Tap Off, so that the charge on your Opal smart card is accurate for the ride you took, especially if your total transportation fares any particular day will total less than the $15 daily max. Buy your Opal Card at any 7-11 store, and the store attendant can explain details further. Note that crowds are heavy on Saturdays and especially Sundays on routes to and from beaches. Plan to travel early and/or late to miss the heaviest traffic and get the most peaceful and picturesque of rides. "

Ferries service most areas of Sydney harbour, you can even get a ferry that goes up the Parramatta River. For someone visiting Sydney for the first time it's a great way to see the harbour from the water. Most wharves are linked to bus stops or train stations, so once you get to your desired wharf you can then conect to more public transport to get to your final destination. Most ferries allow you to sit inside and out and also have toilets for your convenience. All in all a fun way to get around."

While in Sydney recently we used the ferries to go to Parramatta, Taronga Park Zoo, Fort Denison, Watson's Bay and Manly.The ferries are a great way to travel around Sydney and t see the city and suburbs from a different perspective.It's a good idea to check the timetables so that you don't waste time hanging about waiting. All of the ferries we used were clean, the staff were pleasant and helpful, boarding was easy.Tickets an be purchased at Circular Quay but the introduction of the Opal Card may change that. As concession holders we were able to purchase an All Day Excursion ticket fro $2.50 which could be used for bus, train and ferries all day. Certain ferries are excluded eg the Fast Ferry to Manly. It's a great way travel"

            "review": "Compulsory for every tourist. You cannot visit Sydney without at least a single ferry trip. A major part of Sydney's charm is its world record deep harbour. If you are in Sydney for more than a couple of days, the cheapest way to travel on the ferries is to purchase an Opal card from a newsagent (look for shops with an Opal sign). The Opal card will cost $10, but the local secret is that during a single week from Sunday to Monday, Opal will only charge 8 single trips (within an hour of each other), and the rest of the week is free. Sunday's are also capped at $2.50. Every day is also capped.With that in mind, if travelling after your 8 trip cap (or Sunday), ferries are extremely cheap. But even if you're taking several ferry trips using Opal, it is still a must for tourists.Recommended trips in order would include:All ferries depart from Circular Quay and trips I would recommend in order are:1. Manly return (visit Manly beach)2. Parramatta river return (soak up the view on the way - inner harbour is very different)3. Cockatoo Island or Taronga Zoo4. Watsons Bay"

We took the public transport ferry. No need to get the hop on and hop off. Get Opal cards. There so many freebies with this card. If you use it a certain number of times during the week, the rest of your ride is free. So count the number of usage before you top off. Very convenient to top off also.

Yes, the views are normally really good; yes, it feels awesome to travel into the city from suburbia by a boat cruising through the calm harbour; yes, it is also quite a reasonable network. But, before you head out to catch a ferry please beware of the following. First, it can get VERY crowded, so it's not necessarily going to be a picturesque cruising experience that many require, it's often like being on a train crammed together like sardines with a mix of tourists and office workers. The lines can be really long, even arriving as early as 45 minutes before departure and buying a ticket doesn't necessarily mean you'll get on the ferry you've bought the ticket for. Once you buy a ticket all that does is give you the rights to go past the barricades, if the ferry is full (they don't limit the number of tickets they sell) then you'll need to wait for the next one which can sometimes be up to an hour away, often meaning you've wasted your ticket money unless you want to hang around for another ferry (after already having spent heaps of time waiting for this one). That's happened to me on several occasions in Sydney, so if you're looking for a legitimate form of public transport stick to trains and buses. But, if you're in no rush and looking for a relatively cool experience then give the ferries a go!"

Returned to Circular Quay and joined a ferry bound for Parramatta. The ride was perfect and really go tsee the suburbs from another angle...a couple of school eights were on rowing practice. After lunch back to Circular Quay and off to Taronga Zoo for an afternoon with the animals. Finally back to Circular Quay and back to my hotel exhausted but satiated. If one does this ferry travel on a Sunday the cost is $2.50 AU in total."

You can get anywhere in Sydney and the surrounding areas by train, bus, light rail and ferry. From downtown Sydney, the ferries leave from Circular Quay and the time tables are published online. The best photos of the Harbour Bridge and the Opera House are from a ferry. An important tip is to buy an Opal Card online before going or at any convenience store after you arrive. They are good on the trains, light rail, buses, and harbor ferries, except the Manly Fast Ferry. The card must be purchased in increments of 10 AUD and as you use up the amount on the card, you can top it up online (a 40 AUD minimum top up), at kiosks in the train stations or at any convenience store in 10 AUD increments. There is also a 15 AUD per day maximum and when you have spent that amount using the card, all fares after you reach the limit are free. You still need to \u201ctap on and tap off\u201d but they will not deduct anything over 15 AUD per day from the card. Don\u2019t take the train to and from the airport because there is a large airport fee in addition to the train fare. There is another post that will tell you how to get around the airport fee by taking a bus to connect to the trains but it\u2019s more hassle than it\u2019s worth. Just take a taxi to and from the airport. It\u2019s marginally more expensive but worth the ease and convenience. Also, be sure to create an online account on the Opal website and register your card(s) just in case they are lost or stolen. The Opal Card system is the best transit scheme I have ever seen anywhere in the world."

(he also has tips on travelling in Europe) The trip to Manly takes about 1/2 hour and you can get off there and walk to Manly beach, shops and restaurants, or stay on board for the return trip (no extra charge)A great and inexpensive way to see Sydney Harbour and get fantastic photos of the City, Harbour bridge, Opera House, Fort Denison etc etc etc."

We used Opal Smartcard. very convenient. use the same card for buses and trains."

If you're a tourist any ride is fun, with Manly as one of the longest journeys.Watch the harbour pass you by and see the best views from a different vantage point.Best on a clear day with calm waters, but best avoided on a wet and windy winters day (unless you enjoy a bumpy ride).Think of combining a trip to Taronga Zoo and make a great day of it."

If you are a senior buy the all day pass for $2:50 and use all the Sydney transport to travel on trains or buses from in a 200 kilometre radius around Sydney in 24 hrs. No better value !!"

When I arrived at Sydney airport, I purchased an Opal Smartcard at the giftshop. My husband was on business in Parramatta so I was on my own. I rode trains, buses and ferries. At the time, I saved money over just paying as you go. The ferries were clean and a great way to travel. The ferry to and from Manly Beach was very full but I still had a seat. The ride from Parramatta to Sydney was beautiful and relaxing."

Cheaper than taking a tour and you can do things at your own pace. Loading and unloading the ferries is a quick and easy operation considering the amount of people using them.

The ferries are part of Sydney's public transport system with some locals choosing to live where they'll need to use one to commute to work. It's a great way to start and end a working day.It's also the cheapest way to see the harbour. Yes, you can pay for an organised cruise with running commentary and catering if that's your thing but you can also save $$ by just joining the locals on any one of the great round trips. My personal favourite is the ferry that runs to Balmain because you get to go under the bridge and around some very pretty parts of the harbour. The Manly ferry is the well known route but this one is likely to be less crowded and offers you opportunities to hop off and hop back on again. For a real treat, check if the Balmain markets are on and jump the bus up and back to the wharf, or explore Cockatoo Island for a couple of hours and enjoy some military history."

If you buy an Opal ticket you will have access to all public transport in Sydney including ferries and after I think it is 6 \"tap on's\" of the ticket starting on Monday morning, the rest of your travel is free. You still 'tap on' but the machine does not deduct funds. I bought my opal card at Central Station and put $50.00 on it. After that I did not need to think about fares except to 'tap on & tap off'.It is fun to explore the harbour by riding on the ferries and the River Cat goes right out to Parramatta although if the tide is out and the river is low you may need to disembark before Parramatta. If this happens a bus will meet you to take you the rest of the way. I was on the last Cat to get through on the day i went and it was touch and go whether the boat would make it all the way. The driver was tentatively & slowly feeling the way through.The Manly Ferry is the longest journey and it crosses the 'Heads' (ie the point at which the open ocean has access to the harbout because it leaves from Circular Quay on the south side of the harbour and crosses to Manly which is on the north shore and very close to the North Head. Another interesting journey is to Watson's Bay for Fish and Chips at the Hotel or take away from the famous Doyles Restaurant. You can travel into all the nooks and crannies of the harbour either to the east or the west of the Quay. Take your time and have fun or go back for a different trip each day. You will meet fellow travelers and have a chance to swap stories and information."

Spending time on the harbour is a glorious thing to do and if time is what you lack take a Sydney ferry from Circular Quay to Manly or round to Darling Harbour. If you take a return trip,get off, explore and and take ferry back or to some other destination on the route. Sydney Ferries - way to go!Visitors, buy your Opal Card at the airport or Newslink agencies around Sydney and enjoy the convenience it offers on ferries, buses, the light rail and train. In Sydney always have a very light weight rain coat and on the water a sweater if it is windy or cool. Even in the rain the ferry is fun. Open and covered seating is available."

Plan your trip/s; there's a free bus 555 from central to the Quays. For residents living near to the Harbour, the service is the only really practical way to commute and so you might want to avoid rush hours. For the visitor, I suggest the following spectacular destinations: Manly, Parramatta, Taronga Zoo, and Darling Harbour. Each destination is worth a stop but obviously the Zoo needs a goodly amount of time and so should be a separate day out. It's a much better Zoo than Regents Park London and getting there on the ferry and by the cable car are more of an experience.Circular Quay provides access to another 40 wharves - from Manly at the northern end of Sydney Harbour to Balmain peninsula and Darling Harbour at the southern end. Trips both North and South are recommended. Manly for a day out at the beach, Balmain to see an old Aus town and discover the peninsular. I love the Harbour at night and so recommend a late night ferry from, repeat from, Balmain to Circular Quay. "

We found that we only had to wait more than a few minutes once and that was on a sunday. We received above and beyond service from many of the staff on board the ferries. On the Sunday my son had forgotten his opal card and one of the workers hopped off at circular quay with us to let us though and ensure we didn't have to pay anything. On another trip one of the workers went around all of the tourists on bvoard taking photos for them in all the best spots with the bridge and the opera house behind - his name was Grant and he was such a friendly man.

Sat. Sun. and Public Hols. 7.38am. but first ferry not till 9.00am nearly missed my flight."

Whether it is the longer ferry ride to Manly, where you can walk through the pedestrian plaza from the ferry terminal to the ocean beach, or shorter rides to many locations, it is just a beautiful experience. The ferry terminal at Circular Quay is right in the city, so every ferry going out from there gives you a fantastic view of the Harbour Bridge and the Opera House. Well worth it."

I've been travelling to Manly on the Ferry for fifty years and still not sick of the sights, the Opera House.Botanic Gardens,other boats and the capitalists living in their their million dollar houses over looking the harbour. View is even better at night with all lights from boats and residents.The water is so clean sometimes I'm tempted to dive in but would probably become shark bait. They have WiFi, it's a bit slow but most of the time it works. By the time I get to Manly I'm so relaxed I don't wont to get off and sometimes stay on for the return trip. They have other ferries as well to go to different places on the harbour like the zoo, but the best is the trip to Manly. Take the kids they'll enjoy it too especially on a rough day when they'll be sharing their breakfast or lunch with you. Dont worry they can fill up again once they get to Manly, Look Mummy there's Maccas! I feel better now. Enjoy it I do."

From Circular Quay railway station it's a 1 minute walk to wharf 3 to catch a ferry to Manly. Cost is around $7 for adults each way but if you have a seniors card its part of the $2.50 fare. After leaving on the left you get an idea of the size of the Sydney Harbour Bridge and on the right you pass close to the Sydney Opera House. Several small beaches and an historic jail nicknamed Pinchgut are also passed before crossing The Heads, a gap between two cliffs that welcomes ships to Sydney Harbour. Finally Manly is reached which has a Corso of shops leading to Sydney's famous beach. There are plenty of restaurants and three hotels fir all levels of dining. There is also an Aquarium to your left as you leave the wharf. Overall the best day out !!!"

All the services are usually on time and well patronized though in off peak there is usually less competition for the seats and very rarely does one have to stand. I do find that some people are very competitive for position on boarding b it a ferry ,bus or train and have no consideration for elderly or incapacitated passengers. The staff are always friendly and informative if one has a question about the service or a connection . Our public transport in NSW covers a wide area and travelling to it's extremities is a fulfilling journey in comfortable airconditioned environment, except for those ghastly Oscar Trains to Wyong and Kiama which are just uncorftable seating for such a long journey but new trains to replace the interurban fleet are on their way so all is looking good. Get out there and take a trip especially on these sunny spring days you'll see so much more of our great city and surrounds and if you travel on a Sunday all the family can go for just $2.50 per head.

All services converge on accessible Circular Quay at the northern end of the CBD and beside the historical Rocks area.

At Manly, walk along the Corso to the ocean front. Enjoy fish and chips, followed by ice cream. If you go on a Sunday there are market stalls to browse.Then return to Circular Quay by ferry. If you're energetic, you can return by walking the 10km Harbourside walk from Manly to the Spit, then hop on a bus to return to the city centre."

My recommendation is the jump on a ferry at Circular Quay and head out to Watsons Bay. Be sure to sit at the back of the Ferry to enjoy the fresh air and light sea spray which is always welcome on the hotter days. Grab some fish and chips at Watsons Bay, eat them on the beach or in the park, and be sure to visit The Gap as well when you walk off lunch! Then jump back onto a Ferry to Circular Quay. What a great day!"

Leaving the central quay, we had great views of the Harbour Bridge, the Opera House, the downtown skyline, and the Botanical Gardens. Manly is a busy beach town with restaurants, shops and surfers. Other ferries will take you to the zoo, Darling Harbour, or other points. Riding the ferries is a great way to experience Sydney.(Tip: The OPAL card used for train rides can also be used on the ferry.)"

On my first visit to Sydney, I took some friendly advice and bought a Opal mass transit card and took the Ferry from Circular Quay to Manly. As a tip, this trip is capped and very affordable if you just want to take a boat ride to see the harbour, Opera House, etc.The ferries had basic facilities on board (you can buy coffee and sandwiches) and were really more geared towards people movers. Nonetheless, it was a nice trip out to Manly with the \"real people of Sydney\" (opposed to with out tourists).Really, you can't go wrong and I'd probably carve out a couple of hours on my next visit to make the trip again."

Anotherinteresting journey from circular Quay take a ferry to a place called Parramatta which is the last stop the journey goes along the parramatta river the journey is 1 1/2 hrs you will gauge how this city has expanded over the years, at parramattathere are very good cafes and eating places to have lunch and return back to the city."

We started at the Rose Bay warf took the ferry to Circular Quay and then got onto the Manly ferry total time about 1hour to get to Manly on a beautiful sunny day, seas calm, the view on the harbour magnificent. Got off at Manly at 12noon walked to the end of the mall just before reaching Manly Beach and listened to an outstanding young singer ( busker) for 30 until she finished at 1pm. Ventured to some of the streets off the main area and found many cafes at more affordable prices. After lunch walked to Shelly Beach and returned to the warf at 3 for the return to Circular uay and back to Rose Bay. In summer take your swimmers and towel for a swim at either Manly or Shelly Beach.If you are in Sydney for a short time I would also recomend the Ferry Cat to Parramatta and return as well about 1.5hours to add on to the day."

The ferries are very reliable and timely. It is wise to get an Opal card, and travel on off peak hours if you can. The cost is very reasonable. In addition, as the ferries main port is Circular Quay, you can use the Opal card to travel on the city train as well. It allows you to go a variety of places with ease. Do remember to \"top up\" if your card is getting low."

Whether you go one stop or to the end of the line, you have to pay the full $6-7. Going to Manly cost us $15 each return. We ended up getting a Day Pass for $24 which meant as much transport as we could use in one day. This is very viable if wanting to get on and off the ferries. Not so for just a few train or bus trips. Our last trip on the ferries was again with a Day Pass so we could get on and off to enjoy a different route, that which went to Olympic Park for the Bledisloe Cup. We stopped off to enjoy Cockatoo Island and when we went to get back on, the captain called out, only 14 could get on. Lucky for us that most were heading back to Circular Quay. With a very full boat load there were many passengers sitting and standing out the front. We joined them as the inside area was full. This was when the captain of the boat decided to have a bit of fun with the plebs. A couple of faster, larger boats passed us, creating a wake which our esteemed captain, appeared to race into and over, causing a massive wave literally over the top of the heads of all of those standing that side of the boat. My husband was drenched from his head down and was not impressed. The fact that the crew and the captain were laughing their heads of indicates it is not the first time it has happened. Any other time you can handle a bit of water and a bit of a laugh, but not when the majority of the boat are dressed for an event in the middle of winter. It was a wet cold night for a lot of us and yes I have a picture of the crew and shall be following up with it. So just be warned for even though there is a sign stating that no liability will be taken for any electronic items that get wet, this was covered up by passengers leaning against the front. It is not a pleasant occurrence and as an Australian I was battling to find the humour at that time of year."

For a thorough site seeing trip of the harbour take the ferry up the harbour and across the Heads to Manly, then, in the other direction, to Parramatta. Start early. Catch the Manly ferry from Circular Quay and have brunch or lunch in Manly overlooking the surf beach or the harbour. Back to Circular Quay and change ferries for a scenic trip up the Parramatta River. There are interesting historical sites and walks in Parramatta. Finally return downriver or, if time is short, catch the train back to the city."

Most tourists catch the Manly ferry, which is very exciting crossing 'The Heads' if there is any ocean swell, and it lands you at Manly with a 2-300m walk straight ahead to Manly Beach. But other ferries (Woolwich, Parramatta) take you to parts of Sydney most tourists never see. And Sunday is 'family day' (cheaper fares)."

Also a lovely route is the Manly/Cremorne circuit. It is really enchanting to do this around sunset or after dinner. Also board at Circular Quay. Make sure you come prepared with a jacket if the weather is cool and sit outside or outside up front. Even better outside up front if the water is rough. We were on it when the waves were breaking over the people standing up front. It was so exciting."

To darling harbour, then waited until the sun went down to cruise back into circular quay to see the city, bridge & opera house all lit up.If had more time wouldve gone to more beaches & up to parramatta.The ferries are really easy to use, just look for the screens which show next departures etc. I didnt use ferry during commuting times so they werent full/busy.Sydney has a beautiful waterfront(s) & catching ferries is an awesum way to see the sights, wish we had an awesum service like this in Auckland."

But it's the views as you travel from one part of the harbour to another which make this a must do.Don't miss some of the smaller craft that go to lesser known calls, they can be the best.

Sydney Harbour is by far one of the most beautiful in the world. It is a wonderful, busy environment for working vessels and leisure craft. Some of the older ferries of Sydney exude that old world charm as they elegantly ply the generally smooth waters of the vast harbour. Relax and take in all the varied sights from harbourside mansions, city skyline views, Opera House, Harbour Bridge, Botanical Gardens, pretty suburbs, Harbour forts, Taronga Zoo and an endless list of other sights. Well worth a couple of hours of relaxed tourism."

It is a charming way to see Sydney & we have always found it to be a reliable service.We love taking the Circular Quay route (it is beautiful at night) when the opera house, harbour bridge & Luna Park are lit up. We take this route on a Saturday & get off at Balmain East-we walk up Darling St, enjoy breakfast in a cafe along the way & browse the shopping strip of Balmain. We walk this road further to Rozelle which has a market in the Prinary school every Saturday (this is a treasure trove & brings many moments of nostalgia for things past). The bus service also takes you up Darling St if you don't feel like the walk.Another popular trip for us is the ferry to Manly (near Sydney heads)' another beautiful trip.Definitely take the ferry to Taronga zoo, it adds to the experience. Some services have a kiosk, such as Manly route.Sydney transport now has the Opal card, which allows you to top up rather than buy individual tickets every time you want to travel. The card is free, but top ups are $20 increments & we were able to use these cards to get the train to the airport. At the conclusion of our trip we registered our cards, & if the money on the card is not used it is automatically credited back to the credit card you register on the account.I'm sure the morning / afternoon tea, lunch /dinner cruises on the harbour are great, but we love the Sydney Ferries-it just depends what type of experience you are looking for."

If you do the Manly trip go on a Sunday (Sunday Fun Day) because then everyone rides for one cheap fare, and it saves you quite a bit of money than if you were to go on a Sat. For the Zoo we bought the Zoo Pass which is a ferry ride and a Zoo entrance, there as well you can save a bit of dough, plus you can ride the Zoo gondola up to the entrance, while those without the pass have to take a bus to the entrance.

There are commercial trips but don't waste your money - this is the best way."

We would sit there patiently waiting for the arrival of the ferry for half an hour or so, only to be advised by a person on the PA system a couple of minutes before the ferry is due to arrive that it is full and will not stop at Drummoyne. Couldn't they advise customers as soon as they know the ferry is full (which would be at least a couple of stops before Drummoyne), so that we can go to catch the bus? Why make people waste time waiting? Who is to say that the next ferry is not going to be full again? Couldn't they put extra ferries on days when they should know that there is going a lot patronage. Disgraceful. They wouldn't how to run a crook raffle, let alone Sydney ferries."

My favourite place if I have time is to go to Manly by Ferry (have a wander from Manly Harbour to the Open Sea, grab some Fish & Chips and sit on the beach and share with the seagulls, maybe visit the local Gallery and/or Aquarium located on foreshore). If time poor, I like to get the Watsons Bay Ferry. This is a Fast-Ferry and often I sit on the top deck and dont even get off when we arrive at Watson's Bay, just stay on for return to Circular Quay. This particular Ferry goes to Double Bay, Rose Bay and Garden Island. If its night time, get the Ferry from C.Quay to Darling Harbour. This also continues across the Harbour to Luna Park before going back to the Quay -great night-time photos and views of Sydney. Then there's the River Cat which can take you all the way to Parramatta with an interesting stop at Olympic site at Homebush (from the water) - or grab a Ferry to Taronga Zoo - my advice is \"get on the water\" if your a visitor to Sydney - see for yourself why everyone raves about our Harbour and about our Ferries !"

Hop there train to Bondi Junction, then a bus to Bondi Beach, do the coastal walk to the south, awesome. Money very well spent because you will spend a heck of a lot more on individual trips. The AIRPORT train is NOT included in the One Week Pass, but pay for the airport to & from when you buy your pass.

We had a beer in a bar at the peer, had a walk, met our frind for lunch then walked around the park just in time to return to the peer bar for a quick pint before catching the boat back. A lovely way to travel.We also caught the ferry back from the Olympic Park following a day trip out and we took a ferry to Manly, a place you must visit.I would suggest taking a look early in your trip at all the destinations then go to and make a plan. Free timetables are available from the ferry kiosks. We picked up our timetables and sat having breakfast in a great 24 hour place watching the ferries coming and going. There is the usual rush when the gates open to board the ferry so if you have walking difficulties or young children with a pushchair I would try and get help before the ferries open the gates as they may board you first or at least give you a helping hand.It's better than walking and you see so much. Defiantly recommend."

There are a few options to eat there including the legendary Doyles as well as less expensive take away options as well as the Watsons Bay Hotel to sit and relax in the beer garden.The trip up the Parramatta river takes you to the west of Sydney where many travellers don't get to but it is an eye opening trip with many views of suburban Sydney.If you have the time I thoroughly recommend both these destinationsChoose a nice sunny day when the harbour truly dazzles"

On the way you will see all the great sights around Sydney Harbour, and feel the Pacific swell too. The same probably applies to the other ferries, but at Manly you can walk from the ferry terminal to the Pacific Ocean in just five minutes and watch the breakers and the surfers."

Had assistance from helpful crew to pull it apart inside so it was out of the way for other commuters. (Handy hint: take an occy strap as you can easily tie bike to things as you travel). NOTE: when disembarking at smaller terminals the ferry uses an onboard version of a gangplank which is narrower. I could wheel my bike off, but the deckhands had to help me lift the trailer off the ferry onto the wharf. Ive done this a few times now and there are ALWAYS helpful Sydney commuters and ferry workers eager to assist. Ferries are a wonderful way to see more of Sydney and great fun for the young kids."

We have been on family holidays to Sydney a couple of times and we have found the Sydney Ferries to be a fun and convenient way to explore Sydney Harbour. Whether that be the ferry to Manly, Rose Bay or a quick ride from Circular Quay to Darling Harbour, the ferries were a cost effective means of transport with fantastic views of the Harbour Bridge, Opera House and other Sydney attractions."

On a fine day, do the Mosman route or Hunters Hill to see some of the Harbour bays. It's much cheaper than a tourist cruise, and you see some of ordinary Sydney life."

Their food is mainly seafood but I had a steak which was just awesome - and I sat in front of the best view on the planet.The cafe is right on the walkway which is on the Pacific Ocean. Paddle boarders, swimmers, sunbathers, bikinis, are there and present a delightful picture. This is Sydney at its best, and the experience is cheap, easy, fun, and good quality.The ferries run all over Sydney Harbor, to Parramatta at one end to Manly at the other. They are safe, comfortable, frequent, and are the best way to absorb the beauty of the harbor at an affordable price."

You can book the cruises which cost a lot more, but if you use your Opal card you can go all day to a range of places on the water. My favourite trip is Circular Quay to Watsons Bay or Rose Bay. I catch the ferry to the city sometimes from Milsons Point just to get a chance to be on the water. you can sit outside or inside. the best view of the bridge is from Milsons Point to Darling Point, and you can get amazing photos. Go and do it the trip is well worth it."

Taking ferries around the Harbour beats paying for a cruise hands down. You won't get commentary, but there's not much you'll want to know that you can't get from a guide book or by asking other commuters. Get off at almost any stop and you'll find a beautiful walk or a cute little cafe, and frequently both. You can explore the harbour-side suburbs, go to the Zoo, go to the beach, shop, walk, see a special exhibition or visit unusual spots like Cockatoo Island. And don't neglect the River Cat which will take you up river to Parramatta. It's a great trip and you can hop off at any number of great suburbs as well as Sydney Olympic Park on the way. For more information visit http://www.transport.nsw.gov.au/content/sydney-ferriesand there's a great network map athttp://www.transportnsw.info/resources/documents/maps/sydney-ferries-network-map.pdf"

It is most definitely worth it. While it is a \"normal\" commuter ferry, it doubles up as a tourist trip. Manly offers a lot of attractions, both cafes, restaurants and an amazing beach (where the first surfing world championship took place in 1966). But if you have a chance to arrive back towards the city at sunset, you will have an amazing, unforgettable view of the red sunset light projected onto the CBD buildings. Ah, and forgot to mention the Sydney Opera and the Sydney Harbour Bridge!!"

You could buy yourself a daily unlimited MyMulti Day pass and just take asmany ferry trips as possible and it would be a day well spent. Just avoid the morning and evening hours unless you want to watch commuters and may end up standing. This could be interesting though as well so don't rule it out. I am not sure if the MyMulti pass includes the Rivercats but if it does then you could combine multiple trips around Harbour eg Manly, Milsons Point(Luna Park) with a nice rivercat to Parramatta from Circular Quay which is particularly good. Get off and have lunch at Abbotsford at the Sydney Rowing club and you won't regret it but be warned though there is a steep walk up from the Ferry to the club. Best to not go on a weekend as it can get crowded or go a little early or late for lunch if do go on weekend. Food price is average but you can just get a drink and look at water and eat elsewhere. Further along the route to Parramatta,Meadowbank has a nice park and walk if the kids need to cut loose.There are BBQs in the park but they can be hard to find. When you leave ferry turn left and walk under the bridge. Almost immediately there is a set of stairs/path ledaing up on the right. You can walk up through the trees and away on the left are some BBQs and play area with swings. If you have bikes the park is great for cycling."

Just missed one back to Circular Quay so hopped on the public ferry and bought an Opal card at the Quay. Fantastic that this was an option and the ferry staff and Sydney transport guy were wonderful with the help. Hopped onto the next ferry to Manly to catch up with friends.it was so nice crossing the harbour, ferry was comfortable and the people were so friendly and gave me lots of advice on where to go and what to see.Caught a late ferry back from Manly and seeing the Sydney skyline at night was beautiful.Caught a ferry down the Parramatta River after being dropped off somewhere from a bus trip to the Blue Mountains.I was dumbfounded by what I saw on the other side of the Sydney Harbour Bridge. Beautiful houses, bays and the James Cook ferry we were on was really quick.Also had a trip on the bus to Bondi Beach then Watson's Bay and back to Sydney.Public transport in Sydney seems much more efficient than in Melbourne but then in Melbourne I use my car for everything.Would have been nice if the ferry had of run later to get back from Doyle's in Watson's Bay to Circular Quay.Am actually looking forward to going back to Sydney so I can ride the ferries more on Sydney harbour."

Sydney Ferries offer the perfect way to appreciate the wonder that is Sydney Harbor.On Sunday's take advantage of the special day trip offer for the family.Depart from Circular Quay early morning with a fresh coffee and muffin and plan the day of travel.The all day pass allows you to take in the view of the Bridge and Opera House.Spend a few hours at Luna Park to allow the kids to have a fun day riding the many rides available.Grab a sandwich or two and visit Taroonga Zoo then travel to Watson Bay seeing the magnificent homes of the Rich and not so famous.Plan on an early afternoon return to the city and you have a perfect day for very little money."

Many visitors to Sydney want to enjoy a harbour cruise and most cruise ships provide for this but at a HUGE cost, around $100 and more depending on the ship. A MUCH cheaper alternative is to take a ferry to Manly at around $10. Make sure you go on the ferry NOT the jetcat or hydrofoil a these travel too fast and you are kept indoors..instead the ferry is a wonderful 40 minute trip right down the harbour passing all the popular spots and you can walk around the outside of the ferry or just sit in the open soaking up the sun and views. When you get to Manly get out and walk around. go down the Corso to the surf beach. have a seafood lunch or snack and any of the multitude of eateries and return at you leasure. It is a wonderful way to see Sydney harbour and all it has to offer for a very small price"

For tourists looking to see Sydney, jump on a Manly Ferry (30 Minutes each way to Manly) or an inner-harbour ferry (such as the Taronga Zoo ferry, or East Balmain Ferry) which loop around the harbour for a fraction of the cost. No need to book - simply go to Circular Quay and find a route which suits. On windy days I would avoid the Manly Ferry though, as the surf chop from the Heads can make it slightly rough. My favourite is the East Balmain / Millers Point ferry loop, which goes from Circular Quay, under the bridge, to Luna Park, and back. Much, much better than paying $50 for one of those silly Coffee cruises!"

It was Easter and the sun was shining so they could have predicted high demand. Anyway, our return from Manly to Circular Quay was ok,good crowd mgt in Manly. But Circular Quay for the next bit to Darling Harbour was downright dangerous. Too many people on the wharf, and a last minute switch of sides saw two huge crowds trying to swap sides for their ferry. Some people didn't realise because the announcements were terrible, so they were trying to get off as others were swarming on. Terrible. People getting hysterical, terrible crush, no control. I was appalled and furious."

The ferries vary in both shape and size, but each have their own delights. Take a picnic lunch, a thermos of tea or coffee or simply hop on and off and savour the local delights of Sydney's cafe society. Make sure you have your digital camera handy to snap a landing sea plane or a pelican soaring on thermals or skimming the water or view architectural delights or a square rigger, Luna Park, The Harbour Bridge, Pinch Gut Island (Fort Dennison) or the world renowned Opera House. View some of the worlds most expensive real estate on the way to Watsons Bay, hop off and enjoy Doyle's famous \"Fish N Chips\", take in the view from Camp Cove or imbibe Manly's vintage holiday atmosphere and use Sydney Ferry's free Wi Fi to see what Wiki has to say about various landmarks.

Good Sydney weather is a bonus.Here's my advice. Get off at Homebush Bay & catch another ferry back. The section up the muddy, mangrove lined Parramatta River is done at \"no wash\" speed, is dead boring & adds an hour onto the return trip.Take your own refreshments & nibbles to enjoy along the way.

They are incredibly easy to access and use -- many of Sydney's citizens commute on them daily from around giant Sydney Harbour. Whether you're taking a water taxi to tiny Fort Denison for lunch in the middle of the harbour or a ferry to Manly Beach with its quaint Corso walk and a delicious lunch at famous Hugo's, the ride is glorious, the views of all of the hills and islands around the harbour absolutely spectacular."

Sydney - one of the great harbours of the works - is ready for one of the most exciting nights of the year: people are bustling about, others are taking a leisurely stroll. The atmosphere is bouyed up by expectation. On the Harbour, on a Sydney Ferry, you can be in your own world, viewing whatever you'd like, taking in the scene as the ferry goes from one bay to the next, one wharf to the other.A wonderfully relaxing way to see the sights and take on the ambience of the occasion.Make sure you get back to your destination before the last scheduled ferry, as more and more people are coming to the city for the evening.A must! An annual event for us!!"

If you have plenty of time, riding the different ferries provide wonderful sightseeing without tiring your legs. The Manly Ferry is wonderful and SLOW. The Watsons Bay Ferry is wonderful and FAST---it stops at Darling Point, Double Bay, Rose Bay, and finally Watsons Bay. The ferry that goes to Parammatta takes 3 hours one-way.How we got to ride the ferries for free??? Since we were going to be in Australia for 3 weeks, we started out by loading AUD$50 on each of our Opal cards. All we did was use the Opal card 8 times anywhere in the city, with intervals of one hour between each ride. With so much to see, we had used the Opal card 8X in 2 days! So on the third day, anywhere we went on the Sydney train, ferry, bus, or light rail was FREE:))) Do know that the Opal card week is from Monday to Sunday. We also went to Blue Mountain for Free doing this. Enjoy!What else is free??? There's also Free Bus #555 that goes up and down George Street, both directions every 10-15 minutes, between Circular Quay and Central Station (Railway Square). Runs Monday to Friday 9AM -3:30PM, until 9PM on Thursdays only. Saturday and Sunday, 9:30AM to 6PM."

I suppose many people use the Sydney Harbour ferries to commute to the city either to get to the workplace or to shop, or to attend entertainment venues in the city - very pleasant and convenient! I am retired and hold a seniors's card and a pensioners' card, so I can use my $2.50 excursion card to travel to Circular Quay by rail, and then to travel by ferry to Manly (30 mins. each way) or to Parramatta (90 mins. each way) or to Watson's bay or Rose Bay. The trip to Manly has the advantage of a cafe on board (which closes at 7.00 pm) so you can buy coffee, pies, sandwiches and sweets. The ferry has to cross the open water (1 nautical mile) between the heads, and sometimes the conditions can be rough, so the boat rolls around and dips quite alarmingly at times (how exciting!) but I have never heard of the boat's actually capsizing. The ferry also has wi-fi access on the upper deck. I have made the round trip many times on these ferries (very pleasant and relaxing!) but a word of caution on Sundays in the late afternoon on the Manly ferry, because you will probably be ordered off the boat when it reaches Manly, and will have to join an enormously long queue to make the return journey, because it is just so popular on Sundays. I have spent up to an hour in the queue at this time. Graham Miller, Summer Hill."

But they are a really great option for both getting around as a tourist, and as a \"tour\" in their own right.They are very efficient and easy to use, and I highly recommend getting the opal cashless ticket ( like Oyster for London). One particular boon with this is that on a Sunday, the total cost of ferry travel (well - all public transport) is capped at just $2.50 all day.Ferries on all the routes run frequently, with long operatijg hours, and clear timetables."

Also took the small ferry from Cronulla to Jibbon Beach,(hope I spelled those correctly) walked around the bay and again into the National Park with good walking track, fantastic sandstone formations, beaches and aborigine art. You don't necessarily need a car in Sydney, great train and ferry service can get you to many places, even the Blue mountains, without any of the aggravations of travelling by car, just relax and let someone else get you there!"

If you don't want to swum - have coffee or lunch at the Manly Peer and see penquins in the water or try your hand at sailboardingAnother nice ferry trip is to Darling Harbour - where you sail under the bridge.For an overview of Sydney suburbs you can take the ferry to Parramatta - free bus to the stationAnother lovely ferry trip is to the Zoo - take the gondala up to the top for magnificent harbour views and walk your way back down.Most cost effective and pleasant way to see the harbour at your own leisure."

And keep your eyes open for whales at the right time of year. My wife and I spend the occasional Sunday just sitting on the chairs on the side of a ferry and watch the harbour roll past.

After being allowed through the gate to board the ferry we are then directed away from the board ramp as \"the ferry is full\". No apology only the comment \"i cannot do anything\". We and others who missed the ferry line up at the boarding gate waiting for the next ferry in 30 minuets. The ferry arrives and then there is a mumbled announcement that the ferry will be leaving from the other side of the jetty. All passengers who were waiting from the previous missed ferry again line up at the correct gate. They then open the far gate to the jetty and all the the passenger who had already missed one ferry were pushed to the back of the line. Again another missed ferry! We had only missed two ferries so far so I do not know how the other passenger were feeling who were now waiting to board their fourth ferry due to the incompetence of the Sydney Ferries staff. On our third attempt, now 1 hour late, we were able to board and begin our journey.It is no good ringing Sydney Ferries on a Sunday to complain as no-one is there to answer the phone.Lucky we maintained contact with the restaurant who keep our table for us even though they had a long cue of waiting customers at the time. On speaking to the restaurant staff they commented that it was not an unusual occurrence and as the \"Sydney Ferries staff were public servants they could not be sacked unless they murdered someone\".The meal and service we received from Doyls was outstanding. The service from Sydney Ferries is another matter and I guess they will not be happy until they have destroyed all tourism on Sydney harbour."

Each time I visit Sydney for work or leisure I make sure to allow time in my schedule to take a brief ferrie trip from Cirqular Quay to Darling harbour these 2 destinations are fairly close together and you can easily stroll from one to the other or to each from many hotels in the CBD however this short ferry ride takes a scenic swoop trough Sydney harbour itself allowing FANTASTIC views and photo ops for the Sydney Opera House, Darling Harbour, The City Scape and The Sydney Harbour Bridge! I also treasure it as a brief moment of cool calm and collectedness when I am staying in the city. You get about 20 mins with Beautiful breezes off the ocean and some priceless views! Very affordable and fun treat!"

There is nothing more relaxing and enjoyable than a trip on a Manly Ferry from Circular Quay to Manly starting with a up close view of the Opera House on your right to a close up view of the Sydney Harbour Bridge on the left two of the great icons of Australia.The Ferry passes Fort Denison a magnificient Stone Fortress passing Rose Bay where you still see Flying Boats arrive & depart crossing the Sydney Harbour Heads looking out to The Tasman Sea ( their can be a little rough swell) however the Manly Ferry goes through it with ease. Arriving at Manly Wharf make your way to a Paradise of Shopping,Restaurants,Hotels and swimming at the Faboulas Manly Beach.Then enjoy the Ferry trip back to Circular Quay.What a way to spend a day"

Friends from interstate or overseas would comment how great it was to be able to travel on public transport with such great views. The reality is, that as public transport it falls short on too many fronts. Firstly, the \"all roads lead to Rome\" theory that consecutive planners have forced on this city has created a hectic mess. Not just the ferries, but the roads and rail and to some extent the buses. If I wanted to go from Drummoyne to Birkenhead Point I would have to go to the Quay to get on another loop and pay twice. These wharves are less than a kilometre from each other. And for instance, the last time I had friends from OS in town I took them to Doyles at Watsons Bay for lunch. From East Balmain to Watsons Bay should be Inner Harbour to Inner Harbour. Instead, you pay returns via the Quay at $12 each. That's $24 x four people? When a cab is cheaper than public transport, there is something wrong. The government should be subsidising the ferry service in order to keep cars and buses off the road."

These cover the whole of Sydney Harbour - from Parramatta to Manly, from Luna Park to Darling Harbour, they are a great way to explore Sydney. It is very relaxing and with the right ticket you can get off and on for lunch or a walk around the Ferry wharf."

Obtain for yourself an Opal card and load with an appropriate amount of credit. If you're doing a lot of travel around Sydney then a card is excellent value as there's a $15 fare cap per day ($2.50 on Sunday). The Manly ferry is $14 return any further trips after one more would be free for that day.We used the Watson Bay ferry and Manly ferry in our 4 day stay. You get superb views of the harbour features and surroundings."

If you are going to be in Sydney a week or more, be sure to get an Opal card to use for travel. The cards are free, and you put money on them to use as tickets on most transportation, light rail, ferries, buses and trains. Fares are cheaper in general with Opal card and also during non commute times. You scan your card on an Opal reader before and after traveling. If it's a hot day, riding the ferry will actually cool you off. There are various ferry trips, which run regularly, get a brochure where you buy tickets to see the various lines.  While it's more expensive and takes longer to ride ferries then trains or buses, it's definitely a \"must do\" experience of Sydney. Our favorite trip is to Watsons Bay for seafood at Doyle's on the Wharf and a view of the Pacific on the other side of South Head!"

Not only will they get you where you want to be but you will also get an excellent view of this beautiful area. Ferries are regular and you can either but a ticket before you start from newsagents or 7Eleven stores. Even better an Opal card will save you money and can also be used on the busses. Nice one Sydney!"

The ferry stopped and picked passengers from some stops along the trip.The ferry stops at the Maritime Museum, Luna Park and some other stops before reaching Circular Quay. Shortly it continues its return trip to Darling Harbour and the trip takes about 50 to 60 mins.There is a free wifi on board. I took the the trip at sunset and I got to see the view in daylight and night. The scenery is magnificent and worth the trip. Don't miss it if you are in Sydney."

It cost $6 each way and we should have looked into the possibility of getting a card for discounts during our visit but in 3 days used this a dozen times as we stayed in North sydney.Head for the top deck, there is outdoor seating and get your camera ready.Tip: you have to queue to pay for you trip during busy precious once you arrive in circulat quay as there are no ticket selling facilities from milson point, so to get through barrier it is torturous to buy out of machine, do look into a tourist pass.Friendly staff, great views and a chance to travel in the beautiful harbour."

Each one was fine, on time, efficient and provided a nice, cool (temp wise) experience.The tip we have is to buy an Opal card. You put money on the card and then it is a simple tap to gt on and tap to get off. The best thing about them is they only charge a maximum of $15 AUD is any one day. I think there is a weekly max too.We took the ferry to Manly in the morning, and returned to Sydney about 4:30. This is about 14.50 AUD per person. That evening, we took the train to Newton for dinner. 64 cents round trip.. because we hit the daily maximum! This means you could ride the ferries all day for $15. Why get a harbor tour? No narratives of course.Any remaining money on the Opal card is not refunded.. we just gave ours to our family who lives there."

What a beautiful, relaxed way to see this magnificent harbour, the islands and the waterfronts, both industrial and residential.The trip to Parramatta was curtailed at Rydalmere because of low tide but still woth every cent.Some of the old houses facing the waterfront remind us of the history of Sydney, many pre-dating the modern bridges and having originally been accessed exclusively by water. And now the more modern buildings using new technology to maximise the views with expanses of glass. Very different but interesting in other ways.Similarly the boats, old and new moored independently and in marinas along both sides of the river were fascinating."

We used not only as a means of getting to a destination, but also as an activity in itself.Can highly recommend a trip up to Paramatta and back as an excellent way of spending a few wonderful hours. So much to see and take in. This trip can be broken by a stop off at Cockatoo Island. Excellent presentation provided on the history of the place.The Ferry was not airconditioned so on a hot and humid day it can be a little warm and muggy, but alternate from inside to the front deck and it will make the trip much more enjoyable.Also highly suggest the Mosman Ferry. when you get to the Mosman wharfe, take the short walk around to the \"Rowers\" Club. Imbibe in a nice cold beverage or 2 while you wait to catch a return ferry. Aboslutely wonderfull"

Recently took the ferry to Manly as a way of seeing both the harbour and an outlying suburb of Sydney on a glorious sunny day.The ferry commenced its journey from Circular Quay, which is between the bridge and the Opera House, the trip takes roughly twenty minutes, we took the non stop, direct ferry.The ferry offered many outdoor viewing spots to take lots of photographs and the going was very smooth.Manly itself is quaint and very popular especially on a lovely sunny day and has a good variety of different beaches. The child friendly beach is close to the ferry terminal and has some lovely bars/cafes which also offer good views into the bay.Overall this is a most pleasant way of spending a day whilst in Sydney."

The views on route are special and although the trip can get a little bumpy on a windy day there was no need for seasickness tablets. Walk to the surf side of Manly and have lunch in the Manly pub. Don't rush this trip, make a day of it. There are plenty of shops to keep the ladies happy and I enjoyed watching the numerous fish under the wharf. The ferries run regularly and the costs is reasonable."

Our trip consisted of a ferry from Darling habour to Circular Quay, to connect with a ferry to Wastons Bay and return.The First ferry was 10 minutes late which resulted in us missing the second ferry. Due to the Watson bay ferry running about every hour, we were an hour late for lunch with friends.The watsons Bay service seemed very popular and the service is still lacking. On the way home we had to line up for 45 minutes on the Watsons Bay wharf to board the ferry to return, many people were not allowed on due to large numbers of passengers. This is very poor service, can't recommend ferries to Watsons Bay."

Highly recommend getting an Opal Card if you're going to use public transport during your stay in Sydney as the max you pay per day is $15 (adult), $7.50 (child). Travel on Sundays max $5! I ordered our cards online from NSW Transport a few weeks before we went & cards were posted to us. We had to top up cards to min $40 (adult), $20 (child) but they say unused funds may be refunded upon request. We found this very convenient & excellent value rather than buying say mymulti passes or individual tickets each time. There were big queues for people buying ferry tickets, but we just walked through by tapping our opal card."

Difficult to add much more to the reviews already posted by others - but have here a wonderfully reliable service, incredibly 'cheap' (I would say so by European rates) - and just stunning views on every trip.Rather than staying in Sydney centre, this time had decided to stay in Manly and bought a 7-day 'Multipass 3' ticket. For $63 you have access to all the ferries, buses and metro/tube in the Sydney area.Public transportation that is reasonably priced and pleasant to use! A rare experience."

Take advantage of the ferries to specific places (what a way to commute) or to have a lazy cruise round the harbour. I visited many places in this way and was never let down. I also took a longer trip to Parramatta. 1 1/2 hours each way. Sat outside in the sun taking in the fabulous sights. Lucky Sydneyites!!!"

Just take a ferry from the Circular Quay to Manly beach and you will get to see the Opera house, Harbour bridge, Luna park, Taroonga Zoo and take a few perfect shots too. Its a great way to explore the city center areas. Highly recommended."

Living 50 metres from a ferry stop gives me some qualification to write about this experience.Indeed, Sydney Ferries offer a wonderful and reasonably priced way to exp[lore our magnificent harbour. You don't need to get on a harbour cruise- just take a few ferry rides and you can easily spend a half day seeing so much. There have been some welcome improvements like offering free wifi- excellent, but the overall experience is still not up to the surroundings.E.G. wouldn't it be great if you could have a cup of coffee or something to snack on like those wonderful ferries in say Stockholm, where you really feel that it's an experience as well as a commute. We have some old fashioned idea that the ferry needs to be sterile..what a shame."

A suggestion from a long standing resident of this beautiful city. The best way to see the harbour and sample typical Australian culture, is to ride on a suburban ferry route. Many of these depart from the Circular Quay wharves and are a very cheap way of viewing the harbour fore shores. I would suggest the Watsons Bay trip. This leaves the Circular Quay terminal and in a circular manner visits many of the Eastern Suburbs and returns to Circular Quay about 60 minutes later. No need to hop on the tourist cruises run mainly by Captain Cook Cruises. The other trip recommended is the Manly ferry. The trip across takes 35 minutes and you get to view all of the eastern section of the harbour ... In clouding the coat hanger (the harbour Bridge and the Opera House etc). Both trips are cheap and highly recommended."

The ferry's leave on time, most days they are very full with both locals and visitors, so try and arrive early so that you can get a seat on board. There are seats inside and a few bench like seats along the outside of the ferry. The ride to Manly was about 20 minutes, but I wish it was longer, as the views of all the sailboats and kite surfers was wonderful. There are limited restrooms on board the ferries. The ferries are a wonderful way to see Sydney and its surrounding areas."

Yes, you can pay a lot of money for tours of the harbor but you can also join the locals on the ferries and get a great tour of the harbor and beyond for much less money plus you feel kind of part of the Sydney \"scene\" rather than a tourist. Most of the ferries leave from Circular Quay which in and of itself is fascinating, I have never seen a busier ferry terminal anywhere (nor one in such an amazing setting). Boats are arriving and leaving constantly from very early to very late and it's easy to spend 30 minutes or more just watching them come and go. There are many routes stopping at many different places. The boats are all clean, pretty comfortable and run impressively close to schedule. Some are older and have a sort charm because of that (I love the \"double-ended\" Manley Ferries) and others are quite modern catamarans. Most have a small buffet if you want a coffee and a sausage roll. Sure, there isn't a commentary but that's really not necessary in my view and in honesty, if want to get around Sydney the ferries are a great way to commute even if you don't care about the sightseeing. When in Sydney riding the ferries is a \"must do\" so don't miss it!"

The fare is relatively cheap for travel in Australia & you can't get lost as you can catch a ferry to the city from any wharf. Circular Quay has destination boards & you can pick up a route card & an Opal transport pass there too, or from many newsagents & other outlets listed at u & you can also plan your route using public transport around Sydney at http://tp.transportnsw.info/nsw/XSLT_TRIP_REQUEST2?language=en or choose your own language for the site.

Like any big city, Sydney has many attractions to see which are in the vicinity of the Harbour Bridge, the Opera House, Star Casino, and two museums and a multitude of very good restaurants in the surrounding streets , BUT, have a good look at the Sydney Ferries. You can take one to many excellent places in the harbour, out to the Heads and west to Parramatta where the tourists will not get ripped off. Also here are some very excellent restaurants and on selected days, there are fairs with street stalls. The best trips on the ferries are to the Taronga Zoo,(a tip.... take your own food/drink, lockers available) Manly beach and Doyles on the Beach at Watsons Bay..... but, be careful here as the prices are well over the top. Have a feed at the wharf instead as it's the same fresh fish and chips as the restaurant but at least half the cost. If you want to see these places cheaply, go for the 'ticket options' which are really good value for the visitor. After you have done the city limits and filled your mind with information, take a leisurely train ride up to the Central Coast, go to Gosford and hop a bus to The Entrance for the day. Chat to the locals, they love it and will be happy to meet someone from far away. I know I do!!"

            "review": "A thousand miles from care.. The Manly Ferries have been an enormous part of the growth and spread of Sydney for over a hundred years. There are many other ferries going in other directions but the Manly Ferries opened up an access to the 'Northern Beaches' and a whole new population emerged from that 'small step'. The first visitors had \"weekenders\" in the area to escape the hustle and bustle of Sydney Town. This transformed into permanent residential living thanks to the ferries. Years later, the ferries take commuters and tourists on a 30 minute cruise between the city and the beach suburb of Manly, my birthplace. Slow enough to afford a panoramic view of headlands and bush covered landscape that looks, for all the world, like an Australian painting. Commuters sit with their newspaper in hand to read on their daily journey and rarely get past page 5 while looking dreamily at the passing scenery. On rough days, there is a frisson of excitement as the ferry sails past the heads and a natural roll takes place with the slow heartbeat of the swell coming into harbour. Add sunshine and smiles and you are transported in more ways than one."

I recommend trying to time your trip in to Circular Quay from Manly Wharf around sunset, as this is the time Sydney Harbour looks most spectacular. Park at Manly Council Carpark, take the ferry to Circular Quay, have a delicious dinner at the Rocks, and have a nice little cruise back to Manly on the ferry. Alternatively, Manly Grill (great ribs and steaks) is open till around 10:30pm if you can make it back to Manly in time."

But they also afford a wonderful way to see the city's waterside delights - and at remarkably low cost. They are even included in the $2.50 pensioner one-day ticket that covers all the city's bus and rail systems. But even at regular fares they are terrific value. From Circular Quay, go across to Mosman, up river to Cockatoo Island and beyond, or out round the bays beyond Bondi. Look at routes map and take your pick. Fantastic views of amazing waterside houses and gardens (modern and older), some climbing precariously up steep, wooded cliffs - much to envy!  The only challenge is finding where the boat you want actually goes from, and even when you have found the right Quay (numbered 1-6, but 5 and 6 are for cruises), need to keep alert to ensure you get on the right vessel . . . Wear a well-secured sunhat, and may need jacket (can be quite breezy); remember sunscreen. Once on board, just sit back and gaze around you!"

Fantastic use of 45 minutes and we are glad we crammed it in. We had a MyMulti DayPass so no drama getting through the turnstiles and onto the Ferry. We sat at the back of the boat, a great vantage point to view the wash and see where we've been. Those Sydney Ferries may be looking their age, but they still have plenty of 'go' in them! It would have only taken about 15 minutes max. to arrive at McMahon's Point, after one other stop being Milson's Point Wharf where Luna Park is. We no sooner got off the ferry, walked through the ferry shelter to the grass park along the shore and sat down to take in the views..when another ferry came from Darling Harbour direction to pick us up. By then it was starting to spit rain, so good timing all round. Sydney Ferry staff were courteous and very efficient. Next time I'm in the big city, I will endeavour to take the bigger ferry to Manly."

One evening we took a VIP taxi ferry over to Manly for evening dinner and caught the last ferry back at 21:30. The sights of Sydney by night were out of this world. This is bucket list stuff... On a second afternoon I took the same connection up to Manly and back just to repeat the feeling. There is so much to see on the water and that view as you approach the Sydney Opera House and the Sydney Harbour bridge is just out of this world!"

Sometimes, especially when the jacaranda trees are in bloom it is lovely to catch a Rivercat up the Parramatta River. A short walk away is the Parramatta Arts Centre which often has an interesting exhibition. There is a permanent exhibition featuring the history of Parramatta which was central in the establishment of the early colony of Sydney. A ferry to Kirribilli only takes approximately 10 minutes but once there you can go to Luna Park (free entry, fees for rides) or walk around Kirribilli which has some very pretty streets. The little village has several cafes and other places to buy food."

On a good day we would probably have taken a couple of ferry rides but the rain did restrict visibility so we settled on the Manly one as it crosses the harbourAn overcast windy, wet day but an enjoyable trip over even in the wet the harbour and views were good. There was a warning to come inside the ferry as the seas were very heavy at The Heads and there would be severe roll and yes there was lots of rolling but remained enjoyable. The rain was very heavy so we did not get off the ferry simply completed a round trip.It is worth the climb upstairs as the view is much better. Our trip was early afternoon 2.45pm but it was already getting busy I would definitely avoid the peak hour travel.An All Day Excursion ticket allows travel between 9am and 4pm. Well worth it as it gives you access to all buses, trains and ferries. We used it to travel around the city loop getting off where we wanted a good means of transport."

Other times when at a wharf the ferry master has seen people running to catch it and have waited specifically.All in all the service is great.The only downside is that more people don't use the river and harbour as a means of transport so the frequency is not as great as everyone would like.But as a way to get to work, second to none!As a way to see Sydney Harbour, absolutely brilliant."

Located in the heart of the city's Harbour arena, and a few meters from historic landmark The Customs House, Circular Quay provides a world class multiple ferry line service which encompasses the full scope of Sydney Harbour & beyond. It's a popular choice for city office workers requiring a quick daily commute, anyone wanting most accessible transport to Sydney's Opera House/Botanic Gardens/theatres/Art Galleries etc & a quick connect to buses & trains traveling to extended suburbs. The Manly ferry is especially popular with visitors/tourists keen to have an uninterrupted view of iconic sites - notably Admiralty House & Kirribilli House (official Sydney residences to the Governor-General & Prime Minister respectively), the Lighthouse & Mrs Macquarie's Chair before passing through the famous Sydney Heads which form the two km wide entrance into the Sydney Harbour. I especially recommend taking the Ferry from CQ to Luna Park, having lunch or dinner @ wonderfully quaint Ripples restaurant (BYO) a few steps from alighting & afterwards taking a memorable stroll under the Harbour Bridge - if you're feeling energetic it's a picturesque walk back into the city; alternatively the ferry timetable works well."

Sydney is well known for it's Sydney Harbour Bridge, the Opera House, Taronga Zoo, Darling Harbour, Historical Parramatta, Vaucluse and many other places.But did you know that you can access all the above places by water? All ferries depart from Circular Quay.Now I don't recommend you do all this in one day, you'll be pretty exhausted if you do.For instance a trip up the Parramatta River and back will take you almost half a day on it's own.Taronga Zoo will take a day or more if you really want to get into it.A 'day trip' to Manly will take you how long? You guess! That is if you get off the boat and stroll around. Walk up the hill to North Head, Back down to Manly Beach, lunch on 'Fish n Chips' on the Corso', relax in the shade of the great Norfolk Pines; all this makes for a great outing.Then there is the trip to Watson's Bay, where you can get off and lunch at the famous 'Doyle's Fish Cafe', enjoy the Harbour beach, walk up the hill for spectacular views of the ocean at the 'Gap'.Make sure you get back in time to catch the ferry back to Circular Quay, or alternatively catch a long bus ride back to the City.Exploring Sydney by Ferry is inexpensive. It is public transport after all and people use it for all reasons, including commuting to work. Ask about special tour tickets, or pay individual fares, whichever suits you best.Welcome to Sydney waterways!"

The Mosman ferry is a 45 minute round trip from Circular Quay, taking in waterfront mansions and maxi yachts. You can eat some lunch and take in one of the best harbours in the world. The other favourite is the Manly ferry, taking in a \"ground\" level view of the Sydney heads looking east. Both ferries give a close up view of the Sydney Opera House too. They are a cheaper alternative to a tourist charter, the only downside being a lack of commentary."

Seeing the harbour from the water is magic, especially if you choose a trip at dusk. Watching the twinkling lights come on is beautiful. A ferry ride is a relaxing way to traverse the waterways. You can choose to stay inside or ride outside with the breeze in your hair. It's also a great way to see the houses and buildings along the water's edge and you share the ride with tourists and locals, with business suits and strollers."

You get to see up close the Sydney Opera house but as well as see how locals live by looking at those living in the many suburbs next to the shoreline. The bonus is getting to Manly and walk over the other side to see the beauty of Manly beach. Eat like the local and eat fish and chips at the local fish and chip shop. We always bring all our overseas visitors to take this ride. And its the cheapest ride which can take the afternoon full of priceless views of Sydney."

There are so many options -- short jaunts around the inner harbour, a special watery vantage point of Darling Harbour, a lingering sojourn across the harbour to Manly or Watson's Bay. There is so much to see, from the variety of boats in the harbour, to the waterfront homes from Victorian to modern, and then there are many special walks along the foreshore between ferry stops. There is just something special about the Sydney Ferries. If you are a senior (AU), you can go all day for $2.50, and there are day passes available. So when you visit Sydney, please take the time to explore the ferry system."

Last Sunday we used our Opal cards to play tourist in Sydney; all travel on public transport is capped at $2.50 on Sundays, so by the time we reached Circular Quay by train, all subsequent travel was \"free\".We boarded the River Cat at Circular Quay in perfect Spring weather and took an outdoor seat at the front of the ferry. What a journey...under the Sydney Harbour bridge, Darling Harbour, the waterfront suburbs, the myriad yachts, boats and commercial watercraft and finally the narrow, winding mangrove area of the river where the ferry must navigate between port and starboard markers. Although I live in Sydney, I'd never taken this 90+ minute trip before; it was fantastic.I would wholeheartedly recommend this trip to tourists and locals alike.And I'll tell you again, it is essentially FREE on a Sunday for users of the Opal card."

Rest assured if the water is to choppy, they may cancel the service. There are tour boat operators who do the harbour run, if you are a tourist, in no hurry you, you can hop on the ferries over a couple of days for a fraction of the cost of going on tour operated boats,view Sydney skyline from a differnet perspective, do try to do a twighlight ferry ride as the sun sets, it is truly magical on the harbour. Sydney harbour is one of the great harbours of the world so enjoy the ride or two.Oh yes while in Sydeny take a walk across the harbour bridge to the north side, there are cafes and you can photograph Sydney from a different perspective."

One important piece of advice - get there 5-10 mins early before your ferry is scheduled to arrive, as they mercilessly shut the gates early so that they ferry can leave on time. It's easy to miss the ferry because of this."

When it became obvious that we would not get on board because of the numbers in front of us we decided to go to Watsons Bay instead. Again a large crowd was waiting on the wharf. The ferry that took us to Watsons Bay did not move into position or allow passengers to board until exactly the time it was due to depart.It had remained idle at the adjacent wharf for 25mins and had clear access to our wharf for the last 15mins of that time.Allowing for the time for passengers to board ( not all were able to because it reached capacity) the ferry departed 15 mins late. We and lots of others had waited over an hour at Circular Quay for a ferry we could board.Apart from the need for more ferry services, it is obvious that the ferry timetable is determined by the union-run Ferry Master and staff. There is never any sign of management staff controlling scheduling at Circular Quay."

The market still exists, but the distinctive ferry is no more.We went to Manly - Cheap, on time and all the expected things a ferry provides.Sad to see the cleaning and maintenance was sadly lacking - a lot of rust and dirt ruined the tourist view I thought. The gangplanks are gone - replaced with drop down walkways powered by hydraulics instead of brawny sailors.

We took our concierge's suggestion to do this trip rather than several pricey tours designed to fleece tourists - the one trip that stops at all 8 wharfs is a bit too much for one day. Trip to Darling Harbour from Circular Quays also highly recommended passing under the Harbour Bridge and past the main harbour berthing big cruise ships."

You'll get a different visual perspective of the Opera House, the bridge, Luna Park and houses clinging on to the water's edge. If you have time, I suggest exploring the neighbourhood then take the later ferry back to Circular Quay.I thoroughly recommend taking the ferries that ply to places including Manly, Mosman, Rosebay or even up the Parramata River."

            "review": "Easily the cheapest way to see the World's most beautiful city.. There are plenty of up-market cruises around Sydney Harbour, but easily the least expensive way to see the World's most stunningly beautiful city from its centrepiece, Sydney Harbour, is to take public transport - Sydney ferries. Most leave from Circular Quay, undoubtedly so-called because it's rectangular:) 'The Quay', as locals call it, has a station on Sydney's underground rail system and most buses that travel north on George or Elizabeth Streets also terminate there. Large ferries and higher-speed hydrofoils travel from The Quay to the beach-side suburb of Manly. Forget the Hydrofoils if you're sight-seeing. You won't see much. Take the stately old ferries, grab a seat on the outside and sit back to enjoy the views. The trip takes about 30 mins each way, though do spend some time wandering from the ferry wharf in Manly through the shopping area to the surf beach. Just a word of warning - there can be a fair bit of wind chill on the outside of the ferries if the weather is coolish, so be prepared to rug up a bit.A word of warning though, if you get sea-sick. Check the weather, especially the surf conditions. If there is a large swell forecast - especially if it's coming from the SE - the ferries will pitch and roll quite a bit for about 5 minutes as they cross inside the Heads (the entrance to the harbour). There's little danger. The Manly ferries have stabilisers. In fact, they were built in Scotland and sailed to Australia, so they can handle the open ocean. The ferry to Manly is the only one that is affected by ocean swell.Smaller ferries service numerous wharves up and down the harbour. Perhaps the best trip is across to Taronga Park Zoo, well worth a visit in its own right. It has to be one of the most visually stunning locations for a zoo anywhere in the world. When you get off the ferry there, it's a good idea to get a connecting bus up to the Zoo's main entrance, so you can then walk through the Zoo DOWN to the ferry. The walk in the other direction is quite a climb.To really get some idea of the way Sydney clusters round the harbour, take a River Cat ride up the harbour all the way to Parramatta, Australia's second oldest city. River Cats are modern, quick catamarans with shallow draughts so they can get well up river. (Sydney Harbour is really a river flowing into a geological feature known as a 'drowned valley'.) Although you'll be in an enclosed craft, the large picture windows provide excellent viewing.The River Cats will take you where no other cruises go.The fares on Sydney ferries are a small fraction of what you'd pay for more 'touristy' cruises. So take your own food and drinks, and save lots all round. You can get multi-trip tickets, which reduce overall costs even more. Tickets can be purchased at any newsagency, or at Circular Quay.Sydney Harbour is simply stunning and the best way to get great, up close views of the Opera House, the Harbour Bridge, Pinchgut and all the many harbour-side site is from the water. Sydney Ferries are easily the least expensive way to see those views."

All of them were in time, there was always plenty of seating, they were clean, and the crew members dealing with the embarkation and disembarkation were always courteous.Coming from England, where I am mostly used to public transport in London, I have to say that I think Sydney has got it right. And of course having ferries in the mix makes it much more interesting. Even when (as it was on this occasion) raining a lot, you can travel all over under cover.We both enjoyed our ferry trips a lot, and will be using them again extensively next time."

Catch one that is heading toward the Darling Harbour area, you will be in for a treat to go under the Sydney Harbour bridge a well as see both icons. The schedule of departures is very much on time; therefore, it is a good idea to double-check the timeframe before heading out. Again, if you purchase a Sydney Multipass 3, the Sydney ferries fare is covered with it. There are quite a few different ferry rides to take, depending where you are interested to go as well as how much time you have but one must definitely take a ride on the Sydney ferries- probably nice to go once during the day and another time either at sunset or evening for the different colors and lighting.

At Manly, everything was clean and sparkling, with the most amazing array of foods in the ferry terminal. The food closer to the beach wasn't nearly as amazing or well-priced, though. Anyway, the Sydney ferries are great. Tourists: be aware that there are other ferries that market themselves more obviously to Manly but that are far more expensive!"

Ferries departed on time and you have a choice of either sitting outside (to get better photo opportunity of major landmarks as well as to feel the cool breeze), or inside (warm and cozy with a cafe). I came during the winter season, which to me, it is still fine to have a seat outside. The crews were so friendly and responsible. They came and suggested politely for me to sit inside, in order to prevent myself from getting wet due to the weather conditions. Luckily we heeded his advise as minutes later, the waves were so strong that my previous seat was swept by the waves. Once, due to the choppy seas, the barista was unable to make us a cup of hot chocolate. Highly recommended form of transportation, to at least try once."

Be aware on the Sydney side they do not always post the trip information until after the ferry has left the dock. THis did happen to us and we missed the last ferry of the day to the place we needed to go in Mosman. So we had to take another ferry to Moasman, and you would not think Moaman was that big but it is! Then on the Mosman side we had to taked a bush and the drive was very helpful inthat we, silly us, did not know the exact name of the road we needed. But he got us to the center of Moasman and with his help we were able to get back to where we needed to be. The ferries are a good value and really quite easy to navigate, just ask some one if you are not sure. But you really do need to be aware and look at the posting often. And as I said earlier some times the ferry posting is not posted until after the ferry has left....And our situation still left us with good feelings and attitude about the 'counrty down under'!"

So, the right time to use the ferries as a tourist is after the morning rush hour has ended and before the afternoon rush hour begins. The harbor unfolds in front of you\u2014and behind you, and on both sides. The best views of the Opera House and the Harbor Bridge are from a ferry.In my opinion, if you want to experience Sydney, taking ferry trips is a must."

Once in Manly there is a great shopping strip and eateries everywhere. The trip itself was very smooth and comfortable."

The best one for scenic experiences is the one to Manly. However, if you have a transport pass, the only one that will cover that ferry is the three zone pass. Most tourists won't need a pass that will cover that kind of distance. If you're in Sydney for more than a couple of days, but the pass for the distance you need and then buy the Manly ferry ticket separately. No matter how you do it, but sure to take your camera. There are great views any time of day, although morning views might have better light."

But if you want a real surprise take a trip up the Parramatta River. Its a real eye opener for anyone that hasn't done the trip. Once you get past Rhodes, the ferry slows, the river narrows and the mangroves take precedence. You wont believe that you are in the heart of Sydney. At the end of your trip is the Parramatta wharf and weir. Great place for a coffee or lunch. Alternatively walk back down along the river to the updated Albion Hotel which has a lovely courtyard or catch the free shuttle bus over to Parramatta Park and have lunch at the Parramatta RSL Club. Wonderful way to spend a lazy Sunday with your friends and family. Leave the car at home, avoid the traffic and enjoy!"

At balmoral I walked up the old tramway rock cutting where the trams wound there way up and down from George\"s Heights to Balmoral. It was then getting dark, so I caught a bus from Balmoral to Athol Wharf (Taronga Zoo). The bus connected nicely with a ferry back to Circular Quay. It was then a train to Central and my Hotel. During the morning I travelled round the Western suburbs by train and the extenstion of the Light Rail. Being a Senior Card holder, all this travel was done for the amazing cost of a day ticket at $2.50. A great way to see Sydney."

There are many round (return) trips that take only about 30 minutes to complete. Try Mosman and Neutral Bay if your time is limited. Watson's Bay is another good choice for lovely scenery and it is a very interesting destination to spend time above the cliffs that face the sea. It is a lot cheaper than taking a Tour type trip on Private ferries also operating from Circular Quay. You may also like to try Darling Harbour, Taronga Park Zoo or Manly which are also interesting Sydney ferry destinations. Nearly all routes have regular services, and you may also consider alighting at one of the smaller stops along the way and walking parts of the harbour, and picking up a ferry again at an entirely different point. Cremorne/Mosman ferry is very good for this option but there are many choices too."

(Take comfortable shoes as a lot of the zoo is on hilly and steep walkways) There are several cafe's and shops at the top."

Ferries in Sydney and around Sydney have been going since 1789 this is just one year after the first fleet landed in Sydney Cove (Port Jackson) in 1788 and this first service was set up to go to the new farming settlement of Parramatta.The ferry (or Rivercats now) ride up the Parramatta river is spectacular and takes you by some of our most historic areas. It will also take you past some of our modern and very busy areas as well.A good day is jumping on a rivercat at Parramatta wharf, traveling along the Parramatta River into Circular Quay then changing and jumping on a Manly Ferry.What a great way to see Sydney, its surrounding areas and of course the most beautiful harbour in the the world Sydney Harbour.Parking is plentiful at Parramatta, but be mindful of the return rivercat times to Parramatta in the evening or night, it's a LONG way out there if you miss the last ferry.Prices are reasonable, food and drinks are available on all rivercats and most of the Sydney harbour & Manly ferries. All day tickets are also available.Also if you have time, be sure to take a ferry ride to Darling Harbour, Balmain and around the inner harbour areas. Of course a full day will be needed if you plan on taking a ferry to Taronga Zoo, and this is a magnificent ferry ride as well to visit one of the worlds best located zoo's with magnificent views of they city of Sydney, the Sydney Opera House and the Sydney Harbour Bridge.Be sure to bring a camera with a decent (at least 10X) zoom, as from this vantage point, and anywhere on any ferry some amazing photography is available."

The ferries are a wonderful piece of local culture: whether you take the river cat up the Parramatta River or the ferry to Manly (or one of the many other smaller ferries to the myriad of harbour wharves)...they all share one thing in common. You'll pull out of Sydney's first white settlement location, see the Opera House and Harbour Bridge from a completely different angle and most importantly, arrive somewhere that offers an alternative to the hubbub of the CBD. My personal favourite is Manly. Its pre-metric motto of \"7 miles from Sydney, 1000 miles from care\"...really sums up its charm. Stand on that deck, feel the wind in your hair, smell the salt in your nostrils....and keep your eyes open...little fairy penguins play on the rocky outcrops all around the foreshores."

Better still, have fish and chips at the legendary Doyle's restaurant in Watson's Bay. Or even better - but much more upmarket - Catalina's at Rose Bay and watch the seaplanes arrive and depart.

Take the romantic night dinner cruise with your special on and have a memory to remember visiting Sydney. I would recommend taking the day and night cruise to absorb the Sydney Harbor beauty."

No traffic can stop them lime a bus, but be careful, fog can disrupt their running in winter, so have a back up plan if fog is forecast and toy want to travel early morning."

This very evening a departing ferry returned (having barely moved) to the wharf to collect late arrivals; a fantastic gesture and rare in our calcified times. Shame not all the ferry passengers saw the good side: what a pity your journey home was delayed by a max 5 minutes when the beauty of the gesture saw a family smiling, elated and relieved to be getting their kids home on time after seeing Vivid in the flesh. Those kids are our future and they need their sleep! Thank you Sydney Ferries for a fantastic attitude."

Doyles have a take away fish and chip cafe on the wharf and it is very reasonable and delicious. You can also do a harbour cruise.

From Circular Quay you can also visit Darling Harbour and historic Balmain, buzzing with quirky pubs and restaurants.."

It takes about 40 minutes by traditional ferry - my choice -through there are faster ferry for the time poor. Have a stroll around Manly and check out the beach. have some lunch and catch the ferry back - or there's a bus if you want to see some of the suburbs??!! Some say Sydney is upstaged by its harbour but for those of us who live here, the harbour is Sydney. I always take visitors from overseas on a ferry trip. The ferry fare is not exactly cheap but you can feel pretty special nonetheless."

The Ferry to Manly was jam packed solid, so I would be advising you all to make sure you are not one of the last people on the ferry if you want a good view. I stood outside and was filming with my camera all the way. As you leave the Circular Quay port, you have Sydney Harbour Bridge to your left and the Opera House to your right. Must be one of the best ferry rides in the world. I really think it was worth the price. Do not worry about sea sickness, as Sydney waters rarely get choppy, and the ferries themselves are extremely safe. Staff were pleasant and helpful, and the presentation of the ferry was clean. You have to take a ride on a Sydney Ferry once in your lifetime, it just has to be done."

During a weekend visit to Sydney, we had a Sunday afternoon trip on the Manly ferry from Circular Quay to Manly and return and then later in the evening we travelled by a smaller ferry from Circular Quay to Darling Harbour.We caught the 2.00pm ferry to Manly after standing in a short queue at the Circular Quay ticket box to purchase our tickets. When we boarded the Manly ferry we found it to be very crowded with no seating left unoccupied on the outside decks. We therefore had to find seats in the enclosed upper deck. It was a very warm, humid autumn day and it was quite hot and stuffy in the enclosed upper deck. The voyage across the harbour took 30 minutes and we enjoyed what we could see of the views. Disembarkation at the Manly Wharf was orderly and quick, considering the large number of people onboard.We caught a return ferry to Circular Quay at approximately 6.00pm. This time the ferry was much less crowded and we were able to sit outside on the lower deck. From this vantage point we were much better able to take in the views of the Sydney skyline. This was a good time to travel in this direction on the ferry as the lights of the city were just starting to come on as evening approached. As the ferry approaches Circular Quay you get a spectacular close-up view of the Sydney Opera House. At Circular Quay, disembarkation was again well-managed and achieved quickly and efficiently.Later in the evening we caught a smaller ferry from Circular Quay to Darling Harbour where we were staying. We experienced some difficulty with the ticket machine rejecting our $5 notes and we again had to go to the ticket box to purchase our tickets. We also found some of the signage at Circular Quay a little confusing and we almost missed our ferry because when we went to the wrong wharf. Tip here:- look at the illuminated timetables near the ticket boxes, not the painted signs at the entrance to the wharfs, to find out which wharf your ferry departs from.The ferry trip to Darling Harbour took about 20 minutes with three stops en-route. The first stop was the most interesting when, after passing under the Harbour Bridge we arrived at the Luna Park wharf. It was spectacular sight at night, with the large laughing face entrance to Luna Park being brightly and colourfully illuminated. The journey into Darling Harbour was also quite impressive at night-time with a number of interesting illuminations to be observed.Sydney ferries are a great way to get to see various points of interest around Sydney Harbour. Buying single trip tickets for trips is not particularly cheap but there are other more cost cost-effective ways of purchasing tickets available for those who have time to investigate them."

The Sydney ferries provide an amazing alternative means of transport, that provide breathtaking views of the Opera House, Harbour Bridge, Circular Quay and the CBD. Taking the Manly ferry for the first time was quite an experience. The trip is about 40 minutes across the harbour, very smooth and comfortable. Plenty of seating, even a caf\u00e9 on board for snacks and drinks. You have the choice of being out the front or inside and two levels, gives you plenty of access for great photos when passing the Opera House. Easy to get tickets and go aboard, and sit back and enjoy the ride with spectacular views.Arrival at Manly is a breeze, a few minutes to wait before heading onshore and enjoy the Manly area. The ferries are daily commuters for workers as well, and during peak times can be full with students and workers. Pick your time to go on a ferry to avoid the rush and crowds. Our perfect Manly trip was between 11am and 3pm, and did not encounter any large crowds or queues. Would certainly do this trip when again in Sydney.The weather turned nasty on the return trip with heavy rain and high seas, but the trip was still good, except very difficult to get any photos or videos outside! On the way into Sydney ferry terminal the heavy rain was in the direction the ferry was travelling meaning it was not possible to sit on the outside front deck to enjoy the views back into the city.Another ferry trip was straight across from Circular Quay to Milson Point (home of Luna Park), takes eight minutes, and for a shorter trip this is an ideal stop. To go on to darling Harbour is another few minutes. The views again are amazing and you are right under the harbour bridge @ Milsons Point, well worth the effort to do the trip. Note a school at Milsons Point is out at 3pm and a lot of students are at the Milsons Point ferry terminal.Once @ Milsons Point outside Luna Park, there are no shops, and if Luna Park is closed, as it doe's weekdays @ 3pm, there's nothing much there, except the Sydney Olympic Pool. The ferries that serve this short route do not have cafe on board. But all have toilets and washrooms.They run very strict to time and while the harbour has a lot of water craft, the ferries travel well and safely and you can be assured staff are friendly and helpful.The ferry terminal @ Circular Quay is well signposted so you know exactly where to go for your destination.Ferries go to Taronga Zoo and Watsons Bay and other destinations and are a great way to get around. Highly recommended and for Australian Seniors only $2.50 ticket all day for Sydney trains, buses and ferries to go anywhere."

Parramatta itself offers some nice walks and the buildings in Church street give you a feel that you go back to the 30's. And if you want you can take the ferry back to Sydney or take the train. Overall a wonderful package that only sets you back about AUS$ 14 per person. A price that cannot be beat by any other tour operator."

I was the first passenger to arrive at the wharf and yet they didn't give me a boarding pass upon entering the wharf or when they walked around giving boarding passes. Since when did you need a boarding pass to get on a ferry when you have a ticket?Next ferry was 1 hr later. I didn't get a seat on that one because the boarding pass they gave me was the wrong colour. Next ferry 1 hr later, I had the right boarding pass, the right colour but the ferry was full. Finally got a seat on the next ferry 4 hrs after I should have got a seat. Hence I had to wait 4 hrs for a ferry. The people on the wharf saw me with these issues, just laughed and didn't care. Typical public servants alright. Never again."

If we had been Australian citizens we could have done the complete trip for $2.50 each. That must be the best value for money tourist ticket in Sydney.

With just one day in Sydney, we did a lot of walking and it wasn't until late afternoon that we wondered about a boat trip in the harbour. We were too late for any of the pricey tours, so we decided to just jump on a ferry at Circular Quay.For the princely sum of $6pp we were treated to those classic views of the Opera House and bridge from several different angles. We also got a close-up look at Luna Park and several different views of the Sydney skyline before arriving at Darling Harbour. We'd made two or three stops along the way, which made the short trip (20 mins?) more interesting.If you don't have the time or don't want to splash out on a full harbour tour, the ferry is a great way to see the iconic views of Sydney and take in that different perspective that you always get from the water."

The Sydney Harbour ferries are a utilitarian operation designed to move people efficiently around the city, but they are an inexpensive way to see a huge amount of the city from a truly unique perspective. We enjoyed just \"riding the ferries\" using our travel pass to just select a destination and hop on a ferry and go. Sometimes we would go for lunch -- hop on the ferry to Parramatta and have lunch at the riverside restaurant and marvel at how we had gone from the wide expanses of the Harbour to the tidal weir on a narrow river in the space of 45 minutes.Hardy high class, luxury travel, but a lot of fun and a great way to visit both the hot spots, and some neat out of the way locations. And yes, as some other travelers have noted, the Aussies tend to be a pretty courteous and friendly lot which makes the trips even more fun."

By far the best way to travel in Sydney - which otherwise has a pretty shocking transport system - the ferry was always a pleasure to get to places... It's relatively cheap, and there are bulk/week pass options to make it cheaper still. Seeing the city from the sea as a tourist was actually a great way to get an appreciation for it, and I imagine that as a commute it would have to be amongst the best! We used the ferry regularly to get to and from Circular Quay from Cremorne and Mosman, and chose to go other places simply for the ride..."

There are a number of these vessels plying the waters of Sydney Harbour concurrently and daily, with an ambling speed that the rider can enjoy either inside on chairs, or outside on benches or chairs. The views they offer of the city are spectacular, and well worth a trip just to enjoy that aspect.

On the Ferry, you can sit outside on a beautiful day, or inside if you prefer. Toilets on board. No food for sale on most ferries, but you can purchase beforehand at the many kiosks. The Manly Ferry is the largest and probably the most popular. Go with time to spare as there is often a queue to get on to one. Go to Watsons Bay for a meal and stunning view, Taronga Zoo, or head inland to Parramatta with the Parramatta RiverCat. Take some water in summer, a hat and sunscreen as our sun can burn you very quickly. Ferry trips are my favourite thing to do on our beautiful harbour, and I was born here!

You can travel the whole network for $2.50 for the day.If you are not a senior buy the Opal Pass-,$52 for unlimited travel for a week, still great value.Take the Manly ferry and walk around Manly, or take the Watsons Bay Ferry to visit that beautiful village. The Neutral Bay ferry takes 11 minutes and you can lunch or have coffee at Thelma and Louises cute Cafe ,right on the water with no walking effort. Or take the Darling Harbour ferry ,you can spend at least a day here.After a week here we have found the ferry staff friendly and helpful and the service most efficient."

It's about 40 mins each way and the most wonderful 'ride' in the harbour, especially when you go past the heads. Be warned that on a rough day, you may get a little wet if you sit outside but that's all part of the fun. If you don't have enough time for Manly, then the Darling Harbour ferry is the next best option, and if you still don't have enough time, then at least hop on the Neutral Bay ferry. The Darling Harbour route goes across the harbour to Milsons Point and directly under the Sydney Harbour Bridge, so you get a chance to really experience the majestic size of its construction. The Neutral Bay ferry goes by Kirribilli House, and there's a great cafe at the Neutral Bay Ferry Wharf, with good coffee, delicious treats and fabulous views. You can also get some great photos of the bridge from almost any of the ferries."

Wherever you're coming from, get the train to Circular Quay, and hop aboard one of the gaily painted ferries so conveniently close on exiting the station; if there's a wait, it won't be a long one and there's plenty of excellent coffee houses from which to people-watch. If you have a specific destination in mind sometimes the cost of the ferry is included. Or if you're open to suggestions, get a day pass and wander at will. I travelled in from South Sydney, about 45 mins on the train but for $23 my ticket would take me on any bus, train or ferry until 3am the next morning! Most of the top attractions in Sydney are accessible from the sea, including Olympic Stadium half way down the river to Parramatta on a river cat. Kirribilli, a leafy suburb right under the bridge is 5 mins away - the whole round trip back to Neutral Bay and back to the Quay would be barely 20 mins. Go to Manley for lunch and walk the historic Corso and Steyne. Or Watson's Bay to sit on a glorious beach and eat fish and chips. Or get a take-out and enjoy lunch or dinner on board with an open sky overhead, dozens of water craft in every direction and the wind in your hair. Doesn't have to be junk food either. Plenty of healthy options close to the station. if you want something more active, ferry to Darling Harbour, visit one of the attractions there or have a look around - perhaps see the Chinese Gardens - and walk back to Circular Quay via The Rocks and finish with a wine or a meal in one of the myriad of restaurants, some with historic value. The Glenmore pub has a rooftop bar with great views - but don't go on a Friday night if you'd like peace and quiet! The logistics of keeping these craft criss-crossing this glorious harbour defies belief. Well done, Sydney."

If you would like to take a tour around the Sydney harbour and surrounding area, see the Harbour bridge and Opera house fromt he seaside without having to spend a lot of money for going on a cruise, simply buy a day ticket for yourself and the family to the regular Sydney ferries. The take you more or less the same places, without the guides and a small refreshment, but you get a great view of all the interesting sights from the seaside at a much lower price.We bought the family pass, which I believe was AUD 55,- for the family and spend 3-4 hours touring around Sydney and got the see all we wanted.So thumbs up to this way of seeing Sydney fromt he waterside."

You just cannot beat the Sydney Ferries for both moving about downtown Sydney and for excellent waterfront sightseeing.As an American I am not overly given to riding public transportation but you just can't beat this system. For the price of about three trips you can get an unlimited all-day use pass which gives you as many rides as you like on the Sydney Ferries. Our first day in Sydney we took our rental car downtown, parked it in a car park (garage) for the day, and set out to explore. Soon, we were riding the ferry everywhere. Even better, our second day, we left the car at the hotel (in the suburbs) and just rode the ferry into town, then all over town, and out to Manly.The ferries are all clean and comfortable. At some peak riding times they can be quite full but mostly all day long there is plenty of room. And, they all DO run on time.Wherever you choose to board, you can purchase your tickets at the landing. Americans should probably understand that credit cards in Australia all come with PIN numbers (just like debit cards) so even after you swipe your credit card you are asked for a PIN number. You just say \"It's a signature card\" and they print a paper receipt for you to sign. At some of the ferry landings, you will find the only tickets are sold by automated machines that cannot handle \"signature credit cards\" but this is not a problem. It is OKAY to BOARD the ferry without a ticket, since you can buy a ticket once you are aboard from the ferry crew. And, they can handle \"signature credit cards.\"The ferry timetables are a little complicated to read. Even though they are posted everywhere, at all the landings, on the ferries themselves, and in numerous brochures, it takes a few minutes of study to figure out when the next ferry will come by. This is not really a problem. You just wait at the landing and a ferry shows up, usually in the next few minutes. It is important, however, to understand that some routes are run on Saturdays only or not run on Sundays, so maybe a little time studying the timetables is worthwhile.We goofed up and, not realizing the ferry we needed back to our hotel ceased to operate early on Sunday evenings found ourselves stranded downtown far from our hotel. Still not a problem! The all-day pass is called a \"my multi\" and it works not only for the ferries but the trains and busses, too. After a bit of helpful advice we located the correct bus and simply rode back to our hotel that way. (What took us 12-14 minutes in our car took only 20 minutes on the bus. Not bad.)The only other thing you really need to understand is that downtown at the main station, Circular Quays, the ferries operate from several distinct wharves. Certain ferry routes sail only from specific wharves. We found our selves on the wrong wharf once looking for our route, but it was quickly figured out and the wharves are only a couple of yards apart.So take a clue: leave your reticence over public transit behind, skip the expensive tour tickets, and just buy a very reasonably priced all-day ferry pass. Go aboard, pull out your (free) tourist guide you pick up at the many information kiosks, and read about the famous landmarks you see as you pass them by. Or just soak in the view of this fabulous waterfront city from the harbor side view."

One way fare of 7.80 dollars for the 30 minute journey to Manly represent value for money but 6 dollars for the 10 minute journey to Cremorne Point is excessive."

Meanwhile I was waiting for the ferry at least four Sydney ferries left for circular quay. The next day went to Manly and took Sydney ferries, it was as quick and a lot cheaper too."

It's worth buying an all day pass to ride the buses and ferries.The ferries are two level with adequate seating on the insideand outside. The restroom are acceptable.

Second was Circular uays to Darling Harbour - for me this was the better trip involving 4 stops, sailing beneath the Bridge on the good ferry Scarborough, able to look back through the Bridge at the Opera House, before rounding to Darling Harbour which is a tremendous place to be - well worth the relatively low cost.

I have been to Manly which is a good place to visit, this time I went to Watsons Bay, it was a beautiful, bright, sunny day. There are walks at the Bay and you can get a bus to Bondi.

Sydney ferries, leaving from Circular Quay below the train station there, are the ideal way to combine getting to places, such as the zoo, Darling Harbour, and Manly, with marvellous views of the harbour itself. No need for cruises when the ferries themselves can take you to most of the harbour and harbourside places you want to go. Given the beauties of Sydney's harbour location, and the convenience also of the ferries, trips by ferry should be at the top of everyone's list of \"what to do in Sydney\"."

If the weather is fine, its best to sit outside and enjoy the harbour views as the ferry moves between its destinations. All are wheelchair accessable. The Harbour is full of history, so a harbour cruise with commentary is a good idea for visitors. Ferries can be used to acccess harbour walks....some brochures are available at Manly Info Centre near the wharf."

The best is saved for last as you come closer and closer to Circular Quay. You get to see the skyline of the city from a distance, then the Harbour Bridge and the Opera House; outstanding. As far as my knowledge goes the Sydney ferries are the second biggest in the world (in terms of routes), first being British Columbia, Canada. Today I literally had to run to get on the ferry at Olympic Park. The crew were just putting the foot bridge back on to the ferry and then saw me running towards it. They stopped what they were doing and put the foot bridge back and then they thanked me for making an effort to get on board! The way they said it was so jovial, kind and friendly. The fee was $7.20 cash to get in to the city. I have done the Circular Quay to Manly route a few times and the ride is also very beautiful. Thank you Sydney Ferries; keep up the good work!!"

After a week of paying for both (NOTE THIS ALSO HAPPENED ON THE BUS)2) The ticket machines will only sell one ticket at a time. When traveling in a group / family this is extremely inefficient. 3) Maximum change from the ticket machine is $19, meaning that tourists with $50 will always lose money -- especially given point 2 above."

The outgoing trip we sat at the rear of the ferry to get some snaps but soon found out others like to stand in front of the seats making it difficult to get a good photo. On the return trip we sat on the starboard side external seating which allowed for us to take as many unimpeded shots as we liked. The weather was lovely and we were glad we had taken the sunscreen.

We therefore decided to do a reccie and do most things in one day and then return on another day to places where we wanted to spend more time. We were staying near Darling Harbour and so walked to Kings Wharf. We travelled by ferry on a 22 AUD day ticket for ferries, trains and buses from Darling Harbour to Sydney Harbour, Circular Quay. We bought this ticket from a machine by the ferry terminal. Had a coffee in the cafe in the Sydney Opera House with free wifi and excellent gift shop and then caught the 30 minute ferry to Manly. Walked through the pedestrian subway and spent some time on Manly Beach and then caught the ferry back to Circular Quay. We then caught a 25 minute ferry to Watson Bay and had fish and chips at Doyles and a general lookaround. The last ferry to Watson Bay is 3.10pm Monday to Friday and this one is the last one back too so if you want a return ferry ride, you will need to go earlier. Also if you want to eat at Doyles on the Beach rather than Doyles on the Wharf/takeaway, please note they are closed for food from 3pm to 5.30pm. We then caught bus 380 to Bondi Beach where we watched the surfers. We then caught bus 333 to Circular Quay and then a ferry back to Darling Harbour. This was really good value for 22 AUD. The ferries are an excellent way of seeing the areas around the city and you get up close to the Sydney Harbour Bridge and Opera House from these ferries. I was pleased we had the day ticket because you have to have the correct money on the buses."

Visited the Tarango Zoo one day and a trip out to Manly Beach and Watson's Bay was spectacular and very enjoyable. We always rode them just after the morning rush hour and one night we chose to return 2 runs before the last ferry scheduled. Returning to the Opera House area as the sun set. A truly magical sight. This way we felt there was no need to rent a car. The one tour bus ride we took out to the Blue Mountains ended at a ferry terminal. Since we had the multi day pass we told the tour guide that we could go on our way and not have to wait for him to figure out everyone's tickets that was included in the tour."

I went when I still could use my student pass (for concession), so the cost was very reasonable (I think around $20 for a 10-trip ticket). I got to see lots of places that would have taken a long time to travel to by car (so wouldn't have gone to as I was taking public transport during my stay) and the place where I was staying was only a 5 min walk to one of the docks and then a 5-10 min ride to Circular Quay on a ferry, so it was really convenient too!

Luna Park is at Milsons Point. So we got some great photos of the entrance (that famous smiling face) before meeting friends for dinner. We took a taxi back as the ferries stopped for the night quite early. We also took the ferry from Circular Quay to Pyrmont. Circular Quay is a very busy place but quite easy to navigate. There are ticket booths on the wharf. We had some difficulty with paying for our first trip as there is nowhere to pay at Pyrmont or on the ferry. We had asked at the hotel and been told that Sydney Ferries were installing a new ticketing system and not to worry if we couldn't pay. So we got a free ride. It's not in my nature to do that and I wouldn't recommend it. As Sydney Harbour is such a major tourist destination I felt this aspect was not being handled well."

You get to see beyond the harbor, which in itself is fabulous, but allows you to get a glimpse of townships that comprise Sydney. There are so many ferries to choose from and I'm sure the evening ferry provides a whole new experience than during the day.Being on a budget, we chose the simple route which gives a straight shot ride across the harbor to Manly Beach and return, so the fee is roundtrip. The ferry doesn't even turn around; it goes backward. I looked at my pictures for the name, didn't find it, but they're popular. It's the big green one with the two tiered yellow top. It's amazing how many people they pack on there and with speed and efficiency. There is a restroom and a bar on the ferry and it is wheelchair accessible.It moves at quite a clip and along the way, the scenery is beautiful. Again, I took way too many pictures. Once at Manly Wharf, we took the time to explore the main road of Manly Beach and wished we had another day or so to spend there, as well as other little towns we saw. It was dusk on our return and what a sight. The harbor skyline is amazing as the sun sets. I would definitely consider a ferry ride late afternoon, early evening. Regardless, it was money well spent, fun, relaxing and a great opportunity for photo ops, not to mention, seeing another side of Sydney that we would not have seen."

If you are a visitor to Sydney that this is a must do. You get great pictures of the Sydney Harbor Bridge, the famous Opera House and all the activity of one of the best harbors in the world! You can take a ferry to Taronga Park Zoo and any other stop around this beautiful harbor. Of course I am most passionate about Manly - even though most visitors want to see the famous Bondi Beach. Manly beach is amazing. You can walk along the promenade and around to Shelley Beach and enjoy the sparkling waters and fresh air. Lots of cafes along the waterfront and many to choose from - plus many hotels to choose from. A walk up the Corso from the ferry to the beach is charming. Bring your bathing suit and sun block and a towel. Great surfing and lots to see. Everyone walking their dogs each morning, mothers with strollers on their morning power walks, early morning surfers braving the winter which is really not that cold. You will also see the gorgeous Sulphur Crested Cockatoos grazing on the grass down at the harbor front - a great photo opportunity as they are quite oblivious to your 2ft distance! Then it is back to the City and maybe another ride on these efficient and charming ferries!"

Get up close and personal with the face of Luna Park. It's a photographers paradise and you'll get fabulous shots to take home by night, or day and in any weather.The round trip back to Circular Quay will cost well under A $10!Simply enjoy, pack your camera, avoid peak business commute hours and you'll probably find a Sydney Ferry ride will call you back again and again. Also recommend the trip out to Paramatta, along the Parramatta river, in the flat bottomed Rivercat ferry, past the Homebush 2000 Olympic Games site to Paramatta itself. Home of Elizabeth and Experimental Farm and Old Government House. Another lovely day trip of historic interest.Then there is the ferry-Zoo ticket deal, available at the Circular Quay Terminal, an iconic Sydney must, or if you simply want to chill awhile. try the longer trip, across to Manly.Sydney Ferry Crew are always cheery and obliging, from my experience.

I've been to Sydney many times and I always head straight to Circular Quary then take a ferry - it's the best way to experience Sydney Harbour. Ignore the booths and brochures promoting expensive cruises. The ferries are a fraction of the cost and give pretty much the same experience (unless you want a meal onboard, but I think it's much better to just enjoy the harbour and eat at one of Sydney's great restaurants).Here are my favourite routes:Mosman - you can get off at Cremorne Point, walk the easy and very beautiful path around Mosman Bay, have lunch if you like at the Rowers Club along the way, then catch a ferry back from Mosman Bay to Circ.Quay. A great option.Taronga Zoo - to cross the harbour and go to the amazing zoo (animals never have a better view than here!)Darling Harbour - it's not as special as Circ.Quay but worth a visit and the ferry trip is very scenic.Eastern Suburbs - to see or get off at glitzy but very pretty Double Bay and Rose Bay or to go to Watsons Bay (but suggest not eating at the well-known fish restaurant there as it's grossly overpriced and the food is very ordinary).Neutral Bay - a short round trip across the harbour and past the Prime Minister's residence.Manly - ferry travels the full length of the harbour and arrives at this ocean beach where there's plenty to see and do inc. a lovely oceanfront walk.The staff at the ticket offices are helpful if you're unsure and there are easy-to-follow timetables for all routes.Sydney ferries - love them!"

            "review": "Don't overlook the connecting bus services. Sydney's ferries have a long and colourful history. Before the harbour bridge opened in 1932, ferries were the main form of transport from the north shore to the city area. Circular Quay was the hub of the public transport system which once had one of the world's biggest tram systems.Today's ferry routes are all interesting in different ways.The main tourist trip is probably the Manly ferry. There is also the ride up the harbour and into the Parramatta River.Plus several of the \"traditional\" commuter routes including my favourite, Mosman.Many ferry terminals have connecting buses and it's possible to make some interesting \"round trips\".For seniors (from anywhere in Australia) the $2.50 \"pensioner\" day ticket is excellent value and allows unlimited riding on most public transport on a huge area around the greater Sydney area.Ferries are iconic to Sydney and should be on the agenda for any first time visitor."

After walking for hours exploring the central area of Sydney, a ferry ride was a wonderful way to relax and explore other Sydney spots not easily accessible e.g. Manly, Watson's Bay, Darling Harbor, Balmain, Olympic Park, etc. I usually chose to sit outside either in the front deck or the upper rear section in order to get the best views, but that depends upon the size of the ferry. To Manly, the ferry was large whereas to Watson Bay, it was much smaller and much less crowded. On one trip, we saw dolphins and the captain slowed down the boat so everyone could get a glimpse. That was a treat!The views of the Opera House and CBD can't be beat but as interesting were other neighborhoods along the way, e.g. Double Bay as well as the small tucked away beaches and rocky cliffs.Tip - buy the multi-day pass if you stay for more than a few days. I certainly got my money's worth!"

I've never been on one that didn't depart on time and the only 2 times it didn't arrive on time was when we had to wait for a cruise ship to be towed out of Sydney harbour, which is pretty cool to watch anyway. Sometimes you see fireworks across the harbour as you're approaching.There's a cafe on board as well as charge points for your phone and a filtered water fountain.The front and back sections fill up quickly so if you want to get a good view and take some pictures, try and get to the front of the queue."

It was a bit expensive to ride it one way across from Darling Harbor to Circular Quay because we did not have children! We were hurrying through the gates to catch it and they left just as we got to the gangway (they saw us coming, but still pulled the gangway almost out from under us). Consequently we had to wait for about 15 minutes for another one. It was typical for a ferry in that everyone rushed forward to get on first. Once on, we enjoyed the ride."

There are pamphlets for each trip at the various stations. tickets are got from machines, get the person in the booth to help you figure out how to use them. some trips take an hour, so take coffee and sandwiches. Just be sure you know what times the ferries are coming back at if you are going to a particular destination. Cockatoo Island, Watson Bay etc etc...otherwise you'll have a long walk!!"

If you're flying into Sydney for your first visit, consider buying a MyMulti weekly pass ($44AUD/7 Days/Zone 1) that includes all your ferry, subway, train, and bus travel within the zone of your choice. For an extra $20AUD, you can also add on a RT transfer from Kingsford-Smith Int'l airport to the downtown Sydney train loop (Central, Town Hall, St. James, Wynward, Circular Quay, etc.) that is in easy walking distance to many of the major hotels in that area. Check out this website for all the information you'll need to buy a CityRail pass that suits your needs. (http://www.cityrail.info/tickets/which/mymulti)When exiting customs, follow the signs above (go right to the end of the lobby) that will take you to an escalator down to the trains. A convenient CityRail ticket office sits at the bottom of the escalator where you can purchase your MyMulti Pass and airport transfers.With your pass, the Sydney Ferries will give you the best views of the city skyline and harbour - particularly the Manly Ferry that departs from Wharf 5 about every 30 minutes. Here's a good website for more ferry/timetable informaton - http://www.transport.nsw.gov.au/content/sydney-ferries.The Manly Ferry: the upper deck seating at the rear of the boat will give you the best views of Circular Quay and the Opera House as you depart the wharf. When returning to Sydney from Manly, I would suggest the upper deck boarding queue/ramp for best seating availability. And, in both directions, beware that the bay can become a bit rough as you pass by the harbour entrance, causing some wave splash (at times) at the bow of the boat that could potentially wet down unaware passengers and their cameras !!The Darling Harbour Ferry: is especially good for getting great photos of the Sydney Harbour bridge, especially as you pass underneath this impressive span. Check out the photo of the Sydney Opera House after you've passed underneath the bridge - a classic money shot. You'll eventually end up at the Aquarium Ferry Wharf next to the Sea Life Sydney Aquarium - but keep walking towards the IMAX theater until you find Paddy's Market http://www.paddysmarkets.com.au/). This \"street market\" is definitely a full afternoon endeavor - clothes/shoes/souvenir stands galore - and don't forget to take in the upper floors where you'll find several outlet stores and a food court.The Watson's Bay ferry: will take you to the South Head Heritage Trail - a short walk from the Watson's Bay Wharf that shouldn't be missed. Here's a great reference PDF - www.nationalparks.nsw.gov.au/~/.../south-head-map-pdf.ashx. There are also some great photos of downtown Sydney in the distance from the top of the hill or from the Doyles Restaurant wharf (a spendy dining experience that is well worth the price !!) And, if you have time, definitely check out the Taranga Zoo and Paramatta ferries - both providing their own unique views of Sydney Harbour life.I've found Sydney to be one of the best transportation cities in the world - easy in, easy around, easy out - and using the Sydney Ferries by way of the MyMulti Pass is one of the biggest reason why this is so - enjoy !!"

We bought a weekly ticket for trains, ferries and busses and used the ferries much more than any other transport. The ferries nip along at a fair speed but speed is not the main attraction. You can enjoy a harbour cruise, check emails with the free wifi and get over to Circular Quay easily. We took ferries to Parramatta, Manly (which costs extra), and pretty much every stop in the harbour. The ferry stops are great starting and finishing points for a walk or a cycle. The green ferries are as much a special feature as the Opera House and the Harbour Bridge. Please keep then as old fashioned and inefficient as they are."

For first timers there really is no other way to introduce yourself to Sydney. As you get closer, pass the other harbours and the fantastic houses who are lucky enough to enjoy that view everyday. The ferry takes you under the bridge, so close you could almost touch it and just when you think it can't get any better, there in front of you is the opera house. It's just amazing! If you're lucky enough to catch a cruise ferry in the harbour that's fun to see too. This is a fantastic trip for anyone of any age. All his for about $16 for a return trip which you have to buy in two separate single tickets or a day rider which is more expensive, cheaper than a train or parking. It's cheaper if your an pensioner about $2.50 -fab!! The only thing I think it's missing is a tour guide. It's a fantastic opportunity to tell of the history of sydney as you pass so much on the way. Even if its just a recorded one that could be purchased in Addition, it's a commuter ferry so not everyone will want to hear by I'd definitely buy that."

We twice purchased weekly MyMulti tickets for ressonable charges, then rode the ferries (buses and trains as well for the same low charge), all week long.If you have never been on this ferry system, you are missing something. From Circular Quay (downtown Sydney), you can easily and often catch a ferry that will whisk you to grand locales within the harbour system, such as: Darling Harbour, Manly, Watson's Bay and Taronga Zoo. All were easy and fun rides. We enjoyed the ferry system and had no troubles, despite the severe physical limitations my wife has due to the ravages of illness. She walks in pain and has many weakened joints, yet we had no trouble as long as we took it easy and took our time. The ferry employees really look out for people and we found the other travelers to be mostly very understanding of the disabled.Thus, I rate the Sydney ferry system as world-class and worth every penny. Use it, and the buses and trains, to easily get around Sydney."

The iconic trip is to Manly from Circular Quay and any visitor to Sydney should do this trip, get out at Manly for the beach cafes, walk to Shelly Beach and then return. But dont leave it there. There are many interesting ferry trips to be had, particularly up the river commencing with Darling Harbour and on towards Parramatta, the birthplace of the nation with lots of historic walks and buildings. They all seem to leave and arrive at Circular Quay so thats the place to go. The ferries provide a different perspective on the city and surrounds and perhaps a slightly slower, more gentile mode of travel."

Head down to Circular Quay (the Harbour) and take the many ferries available at the 6 quays. You can dine and cruise, cruise only or just take a single or multiple ferry trips to see the beautiful coastal attraction off Sydney.With the Cruise at Quay No.6, you pay AUD28 for \"hop-on, hop-off\" cruise to Taronga Zoo, Watson Bay, Manly Beach, Luna Park and many other places. You can hop-off to explore these places or stay in the yatch for a 2 hour cruise. Buy your lunch before you board, though as there is no food or drink sold on board. Get ready for a wonderful trip and see both the Sydney harbour and The Sydney Opera House. And while you are at the Harbour, make that tour to the Opera House. The tour will set you back for AUD35 while it's free to roam outside it.And... don't forget the fish and chips....there's nothing like eating takeaway fish and chips with the scent of the ocean around you...and the flocks of seagulls...and Ibis....enjoy !!!"

We purchased a 7 day transit pass, which included all ferries, buses, light rail, and commuter trains, for only $51. They offer a number of different passes, included ferry only passes. The ferries run on a very regular schedule during the day, usually ever 20 minutes, and offer ample seating, both inside and out. We spent a whole day just riding the different ferry lines and exploring the neighborhoods at the other end. At the very minimum, one should take the ferry to Manly Beach, as well as Watson's Bay (which offers some amazing views of where the harbour meets the sea via the two walkways from the ferry terminal). The river ferry is also a good choice to see a different side of Sydney.It is very easy to find the right ferry from the main ferry terminal, as the piers are clearly marked and there are plenty of electronic signs. Unfortunately, the other ferry piers are much less user friendly, often lacking any electronic signs, as well as very limited schedule info. Since some piers are served by multiple ferries, you have to make sure you are getting on the right boat. Also, if you plan on traveling after 7pm, make sure you know the schedule in advance, as ferry service becomes much less frequent, and many stops are taken out of service. We made the mistake of taking the river ferry at 7pm, waiting until the sun started to set on a 40+ degree C day. As it turned out, rather than going to the normal final stop, Parramatta Pier (which is a large suburb which is well served by buses and rail), the ferry only went to the Olympic pier. The ferry schedule indicated that a bus serviced this station, but we found out that the bus only runs during very limited hours. We hoped that we would at least be able to walk around and see some of the olympic stadiums/structures, while waiting for the next ferry, in an hour. Unfortunately, this pier is miles away from anything whatsoever, in the absolute middle of nowhere. The only people who use it are people who park their cars and ride the ferry, so I would not advise anyone else to get off here, and I cannot imagine why anyone would be so ignorant as to make such an isolated stop the terminus pier on a ferry line (as just about every other stop before and after it is well served by bus and rail service)."

Single or return tickets but the best value is a day ticket or a weekly MULTI ticket which can be used on ferries, bus and some trains. For instance, ferry trip to Manley takes half an hour, and passes the Opera House, Bridge, Government House, the fabulous houses on the harbours edge, Chowder Bay and Balmoral Beach before arriving at Manley Wharf. And the return is another half an hour of pure pleasure. A ride on several of the ferries shows the beauty and the diversity of this wonderful harbour. We too have found the staff on the ferries to exceed expectation in customer service. We find it a more interesting alternative, and more cost effective than a Harbour Tour.

Friendly smiling faces and young people willing to offer assistance and help to a couple of oldies unused to the current Sydney system. This did not happen once but consistently over a few days. We were made to feel special and important. We were welcomed aboard and wished a happy day by young smiling people.Congratulations to whomever runs this show you are finally getting it right and a special thanks to all those young people who helped us you did very well indeed.

The cost of a trip on the ferry is minimal when you consider just how dear food and other essentials are in Australia, but travel be it by train or ferry is very good value. Recently I took the ferry to Watson'sBay from circular key's, it was the high speed ferry and we decided to sit /stand at the back which is in the open, however you do have comfortable covered areas if you prefer, as for myself I prefer to be out in the open and to feel the wind as it either run's through your hair or sends spray up over your face, depending on the weather. The ferry services are regular, the ferries are in good working order, I personally have not travelled on a ferry that has suffered any mechanical failures. I have always found the staff to be very courteous and friendly. I feel that Sydney without the ferries just would be not well Sydney! a bit like morecambe without wise, if you know what I mean. Great value and a great service, it is one of the thing's that I look forward to whenever I visit sydney, a trip out on a ferry. Where it goe's does not matter to me it is just the magical experience and feeling that goes along with the pleasure. And great value for money."

If you are staying in the Circular Quay area, the Rocks or Darling Harbour id recommend the ferries as a good way to get around. Its the best and most scenic way from the City to the Zoo, Luna Park and Manly. Also good way to get around to Darling Harbour and the Naval Museum or vice versa to Circular Quay. The ferries themselves are comfortable, have lots of seating, and are modern inside but painted like an old Melbourne tram outside with the cream and colonial green colour sceme."

She is envious as can be that I had a seniors card and was able to travel the length and breadth of the Sydney public transport system for $2.50 PER DAY. Unbelievable. First thing we did was get the train from Bondi Junction to Circular Quay to catch a ferry to Manly Beach. Excellent!Next day we went back (another $2.50 out of my pocket while she shelled out) and hopped on a ferry that went all the way to Watson's Bay then back via Double Bay and Rose Bay on its return to Circular Quay. This time my wife purchased an all day all-inclusive ticket that covered rail, bus and all ferries for $21.00 and you guessed it: I still only paid $2.50! No sooner did we finish the one ferry but we hopped on another to Mosman Bay via Cremorne, South Cremorne and Old Cremorne. These would be the singularly most scenic bays we had seen after two weeks of traipsing about Sydney and its many beaches.If you really want to see the best of Sydney, take the ferries."

Sydneysiders use harbour craft for celebrating, partying, dining, recreating, commuting and sightseeing. No trip to Sydney is complete without at least one ferry ride. Sydney ferries range from the nostalgic and old fashioned queens of the harbour to the hydrofoils for fast movement between destinations. The ferries range as far as the upper reaches of the Parramatta River to Parramatta itself and to every other nook and cranny and water suburb. A night sightseeing ride would show you a side of the harbour that will stay with you for ever. If you are here at New Years and are lucky enough to see the fireworks from the water, you will never leave this city. Take your camera, a tripod if it is after sunset."

If the very poor \u00a3sterling/dollar exchange rate is sqeezing your Budget, the ferry trips from Circular Quay offer a splendid variety of short river trips at a relatively cheap price. If you are visiting with children the Transport System provides a special deal on Sundays; for $2.50 per person you can purchase a family ticket which provides train and ferry transport to all areas covered for the day. If the weather is good, go to Manly, it is a lovely area with \"Little Manly Beach\" for Small Children, or the Main Surfing Beach for adults and older children. Manly has a very nice promenade.Ferries also go to Darling Harbour, which has an excellent (free) water park for Kids, and there are several restaurants offering good Lunch Deals. Well Work a trip.Also close to Darling Harbour is Paddy's Market. This is a massive market selling all sorts of products. Many of them are cheap trinkets, clothes etc. from China, but with clever selection it is possible to make a good buy."

If you get a day ticket you can get on and off as the fancy takes you, explore, have a bit of lunch and a drink, and then get on again a bit later on to either carry on or return to the centre. You also get different views of the harbour bridge, the opera house and the skyline from the water too."

Close views of the Opera House and Harbour bridge on the early part of the journey, then the scenery changes as you pass many little beaches and inlets. Close to Many you will pass the \"heads\" which is the outlet where vessels leave the harbour to proceed out to sea. At this point, there may be some \"rocking\" of the ferry, depending on the weather conditions of the day. So much to see at Manly. Lovely seaside shops, eateries,the aquarium, many walk paths and beaches. Also this is a pleasant journey by night as the ferry approaches the lights of the city and Manly."

We took the ferry from the Darling Harbour terminal to Rydalmere, then bus-titution (ie bus substitute for ferry) to Parramatta due to low river tide. My son is not into boating (I am) but he loved it. In winter, secure head and eye protection is a good idea if you want to travel on the exposed deck for a better view - the wind chill factor can be awesome once you travel beyond the harbour bridge. As previous reviewers have mentioned, there is free on-board wireless internet - for details, see http://www.sydneyferries.info/experience-sydney/wifi-on-manly-ferry.htm. But did you notice the power sockets near the indoors seats? Worth finding out if you can plug in your laptop/smartphone etc for recharging while you get a recharge up on deck. I wish all public transport had these features."

Got on the ferry at Pyrmont bay where the casino is and went to circular quay. There was nowhere to buy a ticket at the wharf in Pyrmont and when we asked a ferry staff member we got some rude grunt of an answer we couldn't understand. You can buy the tickets at circular quay on your way out. The view on the ferry was great and the ferries were very clean and well maintained. I suggest walking from circular quay to the casino and checking out Darling Harbour and relaxing on the ferry on the way back."

They will tend to fill up quickly, but if you get a seat there, you will have lots of opportunities to take pics. For the best views of the Opera House, sit on the starboard (right) side leaving Sydney dock and port on the way back. For best views of Harbour Bridge, do the opposite."

That gave us two different, but equally enjoyable experiences. Living in a river town, I was interested in the narrowness of the channel to Parramatta, and the way it changed from one side of the river to the other, as well as the mangroves growing along the edge, which gave a feeling of how the river would have looked before white settlement. We had good views of harbour side houses and bays, as well as a number of bridges, all different in style. The trip to Manly took us close to Sydney heads, across a much wider and more open section of the harbour, where there was more harbour traffic such as yachts and a cruise ship. We got off and spent some time on the wharf at the lolly shop and Aldi, and walked through to the beach which was pretty. It was a very enjoyable day out."

I think you go for the trip...not Parramatta, although the city and Old Government house is there. Restaurants abound including one at the wharf which is fairly good. You can go all stops which might include Darling Harbour but another spot is the rowing club at the Abbotsford stop which is a great spot on the river for a drink or lunch. Alternatively, the express no stops except Rydalmere and Parramatta. If it has been raining heavily, you have to change to the bus for a ten minute ride. Best to turn around or not go after heavy rain. Friendly staff. Nice trip on a sunny day."

            "review": "Quite worthwhile.. Start off with a caveat: The Sydney Ferries are not tourist cruises. They are part of the public transportation system that just happens to be conducive to tourist activities. If, as a tourist, you hop aboard one expecting to be catered to, then your expectations will not be met.That being said, the ferries offer an inexpensive way to see the harbor, as well as get out to suburbs of Sydney that really aren't easy to get to, such as Parramatta or Manly. For around $A50, you can get a weekly pass that covers the ferries, as well as trains and buses. Hard to beat, when a tailored-for-tourists harbor cruise would run nearly that much, if not more.The ferries are relatively clean, not eat-off-the-floor quality, but that's not a big deal. They're safe, the crews are attentive to passengers, there is food available once in a while, nothing special. You can get some great views if you're able to get to the front or back and get by the railing - beaches, forests, the open ocean, random watersport enthusiasts buzzing the ferries on their windsurfing boards. If you take the ferry to Manly, you can see the backside of the Opera House, which is a view not everyone gets.The ferries run on a fairly tight schedule, seem to only vary by around 5 minutes. I'm sure in really poor weather there are problems, but that's just how it goes. The schedules could be difficult for a non-English speaker, but should be easy to figure out in a few minutes for any English speaker.Essentially, this isn't necessarily an attraction to visit, but an attraction that also happens to be a great way to get around the city if you have an adventurous inclination and free time."

Firstly you'll cruise out fo Circular Quay, which is the main Ferry Station. Immediately you'll have spectacular views of the Sydney Harbour Bridge and the Opera House, and all the surrounding harbour . Cruising to Manly is an iconic trip, and a great and cheap way to see surrounding bays and harbour beaches of Sydney. You can also marvel at some of the beautiful harbour frontage houses.If you go to Manly it will cruise east towards The Heads, which are the cliff edges at each side of the entrance to Sydney Harbour from the Ocean. North Heads are the Manly side , and the South Head is Watsons Bay.At Manly you can walk up the mall to Manly Beach, shop, and visit nice restaurants.You'll also get so see plenty of other harbour craft, often sail boats and other ferries cruising around. Its a very relaxing way to take in the grandeur of Sydney Harbour, which is one of the most beautiful harbours in the world.A Ferry ride to the Zoo is quicker than the Ferry ride to Manly, but also a nice way to see the Harbour is you have only a little time, however the Zoo is another amazing day trip, and you'd could really spend an entire day there.There are lots of other Ferry Trip, like to Darling Harbour, and you '' cruise past theh Opera House and directly under the Sydney Harbour Bridge. This is a quick trip also, and it keeps you on the city side of the Harbour, At Darling Harbour, theres many restaurants surronding a lovely bay, shopping, gardens and water features."

In addition to the older fleet of wooden ferries, there are the newer 'rivercats' - sleeker boats with more shallow hulls- that travel up the Parramatta River.

We didn't know what to expect, just wanted to get back to the place we were staying.The trip is unbelievable and worth ten times the price. You have wonderful photo opportunties as you zig zag across the harbour, past the opera house and under the bridge.Fantastic"

For all the politics and problems (privatisation, cuts to services, etc), I still rate the ferries as one of the best things in Sydney. I especially love the 'First Fleet' ferries (named after the boat of the First Fleet), but the Manly ferries and those that go to Mosman Bay are also charming. My favourite routes are: Darling Harbour in the early evening as the lights of the city sparkle over the water; Manly -- a great trip at any time; Mosman Bay/Cremorne, which is probably the prettiest trip on the Harbour; and Neutral Bay for a quick pretty trip. Highly recommended to anyone visiting Sydney, and locals too!!!"

You will get some marvellous photo opportunities along the way starting with the Opera House The Harbour Bridge, Manly, etc. You can hop off and back on when you wish to linger at one of the stops along the way. Quite an experience and one you won't forget in a while, an absolute must-do when in Sydney. The same as the Star Ferry in Hong Kong but with arguably better views."

The best value of all is on Sundays during the 18foot skiff racing season between October and the end of February. 18 foot skiffs are known as the Formula One of sailing. The fastest thing on the water under sail and the hardest thing in the world to sail. If there's a bit of wind, the fleet flies. Really flies. There are about 20 sponsored boats, each sailed by 3 impossibly fit, way too good-looking young men, out on harnesses, risking their lives. The spectator ferry leaves Double Bay wharf at 2.15 (tickets are $15 from the Club which is on the wharf). There is a bookmaker on board (a century old tradition) so you can have a light-hearted bet on the boat you like the look of. For your fifteen bucks you get a stunning view of Sydney's amazing harbour for about 2 hours and a ringside seat at the most exciting sailing in the world. Even a commentator to tell you what's going on."

For the price of a cafe meal you can board an historic boat and enjoy the glorious Sydney harbour. These ferries are not a 'tourist attraction' (although they are deservedly popular with tourists) but a necessary part of the public transport system in a city built around a harbour. Residents and regular visitors divide clearly into those with a long term love affair with these glorious vessels and those that just don't get it. We still have friends sneer at us when we announce that we plan to spend the day on the ferries, but on a clear day, no matter what the season, there a few things more enjoyable that a few hours chugging around the harbour. Highly recommended as a low cost tourist activity with particular appeal for kids. If you live in Sydney and you've never been out on a ferry then give it a go. You might just be surprised."

Also make sure to take at least one ferry that goes under the bridge such as the Paramatta Rivercat or Darling Harbour to Circular Quay ferry. It can get pretty breezy and cold on the outside decks, so keep that in mind when looking for a seat."

A trip on a Sydney Ferry is just so lovely and relaxing and you will get to see parts of Sydney from the ferry that you will never see by road or air. The atmosphere on a Sydney Ferry is just so relaxing. There are many trips available; the visit to Manly and to Taronga Zoo are probably the most popular but going up river to Parramatta (about 1 hour from Circular Quay) is a delightful way to spend a couple of hours (there and back) before heading back into Circular Quay area for ice-cream, wine, food, other attractions or all things put together and more! There are also trips to Watson's Bay (via Rose Bay) amongst many, many others. On the trip up river to Parramatta you may get lucky and see some amazing kingfishers (brightly coloured bluey/green Australian native bird) in the mangroves amongst other natural delights; and the incredible apartments/micro cities being built and developed along the river at various intervals. The old ferries take you through a time machine back to the years when Sydney was a booming industrial metropolis with the harbour being the focus for Sydney's shipping industry; in the days when the now modernised and developed finger wharves serviced the industrial needs of the city. When men wore dress hats with their cuffed-pant, wide lapelled suits and women wore gloves; matching handbags and shoes ... and hats. Enjoy the nostalgia, a totally different view of Sydney and a relaxing trip on the water."

Continue around the walkway to the right and you will follow the coastline to Cabbage Tree Bay (Shelly Beach) where the best snorkling in Sydney can be found. Where else can you snorkle, swim, sunbake and have lunch with a glass of wine right on the beach? The walk to Shelly takes about 20 minutes and is well worth it.

During the week, local Sydney-siders use the ferries to commute to work, so they're not the most sophisticated way to travel but they will afford you a less expensive look at the harbour. Take a ferry to the Zoo, Manly or Watson's Bay and check out all the pleasure crafts, big houses, places you'd like to explore further, etc. Be warned - when the sea gets a bit choppy, the Manly ferry can be a bit like taking a scary ride at an amusement park, complete with sprays of water."

Depending on which ferry you take the rides are not that long (so young kids won't get antsy). There are a couple of things you HAVE to do in Sydney. Riding a ferry is one of them. You can also purchase a MyMulti ticket (one day or weekly) which allows you to travel the trains, buses, and ferries for one price.

The ferries are named after the First Fleet and on Australia Day (26 January) there is a fantastic 'Ferrython' on the Harbour where the ferries don their Sunday best and race against each other across the Harbour - all in the name of Australian spirit and fun.I'd recommend taking the Darling Harbour ferry from Wharf 4 or 5 (check the board) and going back and forth from Circular Quay to Pyrmont Bay where you can hop off and take in some lunch or visit the museums in Darling Harbour.Another great ferry ride is the Circular Quay to Watsons Bay ferry. This takes around 25 minutes and upon arrival you'll be greeted by the smells of fish and chips at Doyles. You can walk up to The Gap and take in the roaring sea or walk along the Heads to the lighthouse.The other must-do ferry ride is the Manly Ferry which goes from Circular Quay. Get there early as it gets pretty busy and nab a great seat outside. If you want views of Sydney, sit on the right, for views of the Lower North Shore and the Zoo, sit on the left. This journey takes around 30 minutes.A cost effective way of taking the ferries is to purchase a MyFerry Ten Ticket, however, if you are doing a lot of travelling, it's better to purchase the MyMulti ticket which includes buses and trains. Bear in mind that the Manly Ferry is covered by a MyFerry2 ticket or a MyMulti1. Enjoy!I love the ferries and it's a great way to get around, I'm very lucky to live very near a ferry wharf so occasionally take the ferry to work; a fab way to start your day!"

It's probably true of all cities on the water, but the ferries really do take you do different places, and you see quite a different vista depending on whether you go up to Manly or over to the East or the West... and it's worth taking each trip. Because they are regular commuter ferries, some are included on trip passes, but also are fairly cheap to take. If you're going to Taronga Zoo, you really SHOULD take the ferry. Definitely a highlight. If you tend to mild seasickness, a lot of them are fine, but the ferry out to Manly can be a bit trickier."

The latter shows scenic views of many Sydney waterfront suburbs and the outer harbor, including the cliffs guarding the ocean entrance to the harbor.The ferries are painted with 2-tone colors. Most ferries are small and look like cute toys. The ride is steady and comfy. There are seats inside and outside (bow, stern and both sides). On a sunny clear day, you may not want to disembark but keep on cruising!In my opinion, Sydney has the best scenic ferry routes in the world.

It seems weird to say that a form of public transportation would be one of your favorite parts of visiting a city, but in the case of the Sydney ferries, it's true! The ferries are so easy to use: they run frequently, the schedules are clearly posted, and they run on-time. We used them to access Darling Harbour, Manly, Taronga Zoo, Watson's Bay, and neighborhoods along the river. Staff on-board was always helpful. Best of all, it's a completely pleasurable way to get from place-to-place -- you are sailing through Sydney Harbour, with gorgeous views of the Opera House, Harbour Bridge, and wonderful waterside homes and buildings of the city! These moments on the boats were some of our favorite Sydney memories."

The wharfs on each end were clean and nice, and we got to to experience Manly, which we probably wouldn't have done otherwise. If you go to Manly in the morning from Circular Quay, and come back in the evening, you'll get better pictures (you won't be looking at the sun) if you sit facing the harbour bridge in the AM, and the other side of the boat in the afternoon."

The views of the Royal Botanical Gardens, and the Opera House were fabulous.Next we journeyed to Manly where we had lunch at one of the many great eateries in the area. We enjoyed a pleasant walk along the path/park above manly beach and enjoyed watching surfing lessons and the beautiful blue water and sky. Then we went on the ferry that goes all the way to Parramatta - what a great journey this was - under the Sydney Harbour Bridge, stop off at Luna Park, more lovely homes, historical sites, boats, other ferries, the list is really endless. It was getting dark as we arrived in Darling Harbour and the lights of the buildings were magical as was the changing sky.A really great way to see a lot of Sydney and enjoy the variety of ferries - so many of them are so cute!!!"

The return ferry is the best way to see the Sydney skyline. It takes 30 minutes each way, and runs throughout the day. If you have little time, you can take a ferry to Taronga Zoo and back, you get the great harbour views, 12 minutes each way! If you have more time, take the ferry to Parramatta. The express service takes just under one hour each way. If you combine the Manly and Parramatta ferries, you've seen the entire Harbour, and the river that feeds it! If you're doing both in one day, I suggest starting early, and going to Parramatta first. You can walk a few blocks, get a coffee, and take the ferry back to Sydney. Lunch in Circular Quay, or Manly. NIce cafes in both spots. Walk along Manly's beautiful beach. Stay in Manly until dark, the city lights from the ferry are outstanding. The rail and ferries in combination offer tourists a great way to see most of the city, and some of the best beaches, without the bother of hiring (and parking) a car.website... http://www.sydneyferries.info/"

Maybe it helps that the weather was great - blue skies and warm - when I was there (supposedly this was winter!) but the ferries were a marvellous attraction in their own right. They are practical commuter transport on the routes they serve; and in my experience (6 trips) efficient, reliable, well-organised (good information provided about the many routes available from Circular Quay) and with some notably friendly staff.As a tourist, I was using them as much to enjoy cruising around the harbour and river as to go anywhere in particular. The varying views of the harbour (not just the Opera House and that Bridge) are terrific - you do need to be outside the cabin, preferably in the bow. I can recommend the trip to Watson's Bay - a few minutes walk brings you to the Gap and clifftop views over the open sea. I enjoyed going upriver to Paramatta too - it's not as scenic in any wow factor way but you do see a different, surprisingly quiet at times, part of Sydney (with some low-key heritage attractions). I got the train back just for a change of experience and scenery. Which leads to the point made by others that the best value way to use the ferries and local trains and buses is with a combined pass: I used a Daytripper ticket costing 17.40 Australian dollars in August 2009 .Personally, I much prefer this way of travelling (on \"normal\" services) to specialized trips for tourists - so much cheaper, more flexible and no commentary!(I was also impressed with Sydney's trains and buses - maybe it's because I live in the UK!)"

Now, down to ONE mid-day \"cruise.\" They had 1 lousy sandwich \"selection\" at the cafe... and most people were BYO food and BOOZE! Not a way to run a cruise! To make matters worse, the SLOW BOAT TO CHINA dropped off one of the crew at the \"workyard\" (an unscheduled, time wasting stop). It's far better to waste 20 minutes of 100 tourists time than to give 1 crewmember cab fare to the workyard. Plus, those tourists must have really enjoyed seeing that \"SIGHT.\" Something is going downhill fast here. The FAST CAT to Manly has ceased to run... PERIOD! The remaining CAT to Palmaretta went SLOWLY and at the end of the river had to CREEP. It was a boring and stupid river excursion. Well, they are saving big bucks I guess by providing outdated and SLOW ferries... \"NO WORRIES\" about running a fast and reliable CAT! If you should get stuck on one of the state run ferries, check out how dirty and worn out the seats and carpets are. We took a good roll when a competing company went by and a dirty filthy mop fell down across the passageway. Of course, there was nobody to attend to it. You could see the PRIDE and excellent seamanship of the staff all summed up in that dirty filthy mop that they were possibly swabbing the decks with OCCASIONALLY! Best advice on the ferries... Use the buses instead if you need to get somewhere. If you want to tour the harbour or go to Manly, use a PRIVATE operator. And don't even think of using these ferries for a cruise. TAKE A PRIVATELY OPERATED DINNER CRUISE (\"STEAM or SAIL!\"). What a sad sad Ferry \"System.\""

Sydney tourists can save many dollars by taking various public ferries around Sydney Harbour (operator is government owned Sydney Ferries) rather than paying for expensive and overpriced Captain Cooks' or similar private enterprise tours.Buy an A$16 multi-modal Day Rover from any railway station or ferry terminal and make as many trips as you wish in a day. You can travel to about 60km from the Sydney CBD though of course the ferries do not operate as far from Sydney's CBD as the trains or buses. There is an excellent walking tours brochure available from the Tourist Information stall near Circular Quay.The iconic trip is a return journey from Circular Quay to Manly, because in 30 minutes each way you can be subject to the swells from the mouth of Sydney Harbour. Occasionally these ferries are cancelled due to rough weather, but Manly as a destination is delightful with many short or longish walks possible, some involving a walk through parts of Sydney Harbour National Park.The Inner Harbour ferries trundle slowly from wharf to wharf such as Old Cremorne. This is a ritzy part of town (you'll see the Prime Minister's and Governor General's residences) and if you alight at one of the wharves, a walk along the Harbour is possible. Either return to Circular Quay by ferry or choose a bus terminus and travel back across the Sydney Harbour Bridge.On the southern shore, a visit to Watsons Bay is a special treat, with walks and lunch at Doyles a favourite.Lastly there is the slow Rivercats to Parramatta along the River of the latter city's name. This passes through many mangroves with the riverbanks at times playing host to unattractive industries, although redevelopment is occuring in some places. It is not difficult to return by CityRail train but the walk between the ferry and the railway station takes about 15 minutes for a reasonably fast walker.Don't forget the obligatory shot of your family or friends on board a ferry passing the Sydney Opera House!"
