Lovely and interesting wander around Ho Chi Minh's residences and gardens - including a collection of his cars! Be aware that it closes at 4pm sharp - you could spend anywhere between 30 minutes and a couple of hours here. Drinks available at the end - we recommend the whole coconuts (drink the water and then get them to chop it in half so you can spoon out the flesh). Unlike some other reviewers, we weren't expecting to see inside the Palace (didn't have time anyway), so were happy with our visit. Don't lean on painted walls - it comes off!"

He did not live in the palace, but in the servants quarters, then a house on stilts. It takes you through some of the history of his life. Definitely better with a guide. Also, be aware that there are times when you cannot view the bidy due to maintenance. Check first if that is something you want to do."

This is definitely a palace fit for a president, but apparently Ho Chi Minh was a conservative type that was not interested in all of the finery that this palace offered. He opted instead to live in the adjacent stilt house which did not even have in suite bathrooms. This is a beautiful property with many beautiful trails through the trees. It is a great place to commune with nature."

A walk through the old building as it has been basically preserved from those days. The old American communications centre in the basement and graphic displays of the war in video and photo. It is one of those experiences that once again we are assured of \"man's inhumaity to man\". Not to be missed if only as a lesson on the present as well as an historical archive.

They do not open on Monday and Friday. There are student groups and tour groups queueing for the two different attraction everyday. For free & easy traveller, it can be very confusing and the soldiers do not speak English and so help is limited. Some suggestion: 1) Go early before opening time 2) The 2 attractions are at the Ba Dinh square and there are two different queues for the two attraction. it is very crowded and so take note of people jumping queue 3) Bring small bags because they will do security scan 4) No bermudas and slippers allowed. Wear decent 5) forget about going on sat and sun. the queue is too long 6) If you want to visit both attraction, queue for Ho Chi Minh's Mausoleum first because the queue is longer. 7) Tell the taxi driver to stop at the area for the queue because Ba Dinh square is quite big and you may have to walk a long way to the queueing area if he stop at other side of the square. 8) Tell the hotel to write the attraction in vietnamese so that you can show it to the soldiers to check which queue for which attraction."

Mrs. Yank and I visited the Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum, and since this is next door, we gave it a look. The palace is handsome, but closed to the public apparently. But the \"stilt house\", Ho's final home, in the palace gardens is open for viewing. It's very simple - 2 rooms, still furnished as they were at his death in 1969. Expect a long line, but it moves quickly, and it's far shorter than the line for the mausoleum. There's a garage with 3 old cars, 1 Peugeot and 2 Soviet vehicles. The gardens and lake are very attractive and well-kept. If you're already at the mausoleum, you might as well check this out. The cost is minimal (40,000 VND)."

The large presidential palace, formerly the residence of the French governor in colonial times, was not open (and our understanding from the guide is that it never is). But the grounds are interesting and the paths lead inevitably to the \"house on stilts\", where Ho Chi Minh lived rather than in the palatial residence to which he was entitled. Adjacent to the house on stilts is a small, bunkered bedroom in which Ho died in 1969. Although the grounds tend to be crowded, especially on the weekends, everyone was moving well when we toured. It's a slight disadvantage that there is so little signage, and what little there is is only in Vietnamese. Well worth a visit as a reflection of Vietnamese history."

We were even lucky enough to see a ceremony on the grounds were exceptional communist party members were presented with medals. The grounds held peaceful gardens, Koi carp pond, palace and a collection of vintage cars. Also the site helped reveal Ho Chi Minh's modesty and how he humbly wished to better Vietnam.

This was an unpleasant experience and a waste of half a day. We are trying not to let it spoil our impression of Vietnam, however. Here is a list of issues, in no particular order: - The entrance is unfathomably difficult to find.  - It is closed for half the day and no one seemed to know the opening times.  - The guards are unfriendly.  - The mausoleum is ugly.  - There are no signposts and the site is huge so you end up walking in circles a lot - The museum is worse than useless: just a load of communist propaganda trying to justify the regime.  - The one pillar pagoda is deeply unimpressive.  - The botanical garden entrance is not at all close and is hard to find, despite being next door. And it is the worst botanical garden I've been to.  - There is an unnecessary dress code (long trousers). A waste of time - half a day of my life that I won't get back."

Presidential palace was built between 1900 and 1906 to house the then french governor. post independence in 1954, president Ho chi Minh decided not to stay in such palatial building and decided to build a Vietnam style house adjacent to presidential palace. I am told that palace is used as president's office. You can see the palace from a close distance only. Entire area is kept neatly with flowers. Behind the palace is the stilt that ho Minh built for his stay. He stayed there from 1958 till death in 69. Very simple place with almost basic setting that shows the humbleness of the man. Place is well maintained. Three cars are there which president received. One of them as I remember was from Russia. Ho chi Minh mausoleum is also there but I couldn't go inside.Good place and a must see in hanoi. There are time restrictions here and hence need to check with guide before going."

After we visited the Mausoleum we really wanted to go to the Ho Chi Minh Museum but it seemed that the only way to get there was to go through the Presidential Palace site which was a separate small entrance fee. There was a sign pointing to the museum but on attempting to follow it a guard made it clear that we must not go that way. It sort of felt like they were forcing you to do the entire complex when we wanted to skip this part.In the Presidential Palace complex we saw the garage of his cars and the small stilted house where he slept and worked. It was interesting but didn't contain any information that we didn't get elsewhere. It was also very busy and the pathways are narrow so you can't skip parts of this either as you just have to shuffle along with the crowds through the designated pathway. i stopped to wait for my husband who had been caught behind another group and a guard used his megaphone to blast a sound in my direction and waved me along."

The story goes that he considered the palace too grand for him and that one act, of living in a typical humble workers house really brings to life the nature and the charisma of the leader of the nationalist movement. Its a lovely setting and worth the few dollars entrance fee. Good cafe, shops and amenties availiable."

Additionally, the masses of Vietnamese visitors stands as a tribute to their continued devotion to their beloved leader."

The initial yellow and grand French buildings were lived in for only 4 years before he decided to live in a more ethnic building. His people dutifully built a house on stilts across the lake where he continued to be served his meals which were prepared and cooked from the French house. Do not miss the personal bunker situated right next to his ethnic house, accessed through his guard's building. The green low building next to the house on stilts was built for his medical team. An interesting visit if you can stand crowds - kept in orderly queues by uniformed guards!"

But you can walk around the extensive gardens and see the little house that Ho Chi Minh chose to live in, shunning the luxury of the place. The house is preserved exactly as it was in Ho's time with old furniture and pones etc and you can get a very good feel of what it was like as he was leading his country from there. You can also see the vintage cars that he was given as gifts. The Gardens themselves are also lovely, with lakes and some very interesting trees and plants. Though it was a very hot day the gardens are quite cool and you can see why Ho chose to spend so much of his time here.Overall I would say that this a definite must see if you visit Hanoi."

There is a display of \u2018Ho Chi Minh\u2019s automobiles he used during his life.In stark contrast to the understated stilt house is the imposing Presidential Palace, a beautifully restored colonial building constructed in 1906 as the Palace of the Governor General of Indochina.

While I was intrigued by the experience of visiting the Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum I found walking through the presidential palace grounds and visiting the house Ho lived in much more interesting. We were lucky our tour guide was with us to add more detail and colour to what we were seeing. You can see the rooms Ho lived in initially as president (which apparently were tradesmen's quarters on the palace grounds) see the cars he used which were gifted by other countries for his use, and most interesting the longhouse he lived most in. I found it very interesting to learn there is no kitchen in his house as he often ate with staff in another building. The site is a popular with Vietnamese so very crowded and unfortunately pressure to keep moving when I would liked to spent more time looking at the house. The grounds are very pleasant to walk through."

This site comprises the Presidential Palace, a simple house on stilts, a museum, gardens, and cars used by the President during his 15 year stay before his death in 1969. It's located close to Ho Chi Minh's mausoleum. There's also pagoda nearby.The imposing yellow-painted Presidential Palace (originally built by the French colonisers) is not open to the public and is these days apparently used occasionally to greet foreign dignitaries. Understandably HCM didn't stay in it. Instead he had a simple timber house on stilts built in the grounds (it is claimed) which served as his living and working quarters. The house has just two rooms with personal effects on display (desk, bed, clock etc.) and, strangely, no toilet. The house is set in a large botanical garden filled with mango trees and a large pond full of carp. There is also an orchard and pergola.There are other buildings close to the stilt house and probably where HCM spent most of his time, and a little safer and hidden during the war time I'd imagine. We saw a dining room with a table set and a study. Next to these were three cars claimed to have been used by the President. Within the same complex but closer to the mausoleum is the One Pillar Pagoda representing a lotus flower. It's an interesting building, but not the original 1049 construction (that was destroyed by the retreating French in 1954 - why, oh why I ask - what strategic value was there?). Fortunately it was rebuilt almost straight away.All in all, it is an interesting place to visit, and I can understand why it is revered by most Vietnamese. You get a sense of the history it is capturing and the pinnacle upon which Ho Chi Minh is placed in Vietnam."

The President seems like resting/sleeping peacefully.What i want to comment here is during my visit to the presidential (old house) where when i just walked in and strolling over the house area, trying to read and learn about HCM history, furniture, etc. suddenly me and my family were chased away/OUT from that area just because it's their lunch time, what?? Seriously, lunch time at 11:00 a.m??And how can a tourist spot can be closed for lunch time?? What???We paid 20K VD just to enter the HCM old house, yes it's very little money but it's NOT free!! But the mausoleum is free.At the end of my trip, especially at the HCM Square I can say I learned NOTHING!It seems that this place is 'NOT READY' to 'share' their history stories to the tourist yet. I was very disappointed during my whole visit. I was waiting to come to this place months and months before, and what I expect from this place maybe little higher than what they can give, probably. But, lunch time at tourist stop? hmm..Hopefully they will improved.My advice, just come very early, meaning 08:00 AM you have to be there at the Square already."

The majestic French colonial yellow building was stunning. We couldn\u2019t go inside, but it was lovely to see from the outside and its surrounding gardens were very picturesque. Ho Chi Minh had no family and the palace is so large that he chose instead to live in other residences on the property. You can visit these: house number 54 where he lived and worked since 1954, including a selection of cars he received as gifts from Russia, and his house on stilts. It was nice to walk around and look at the well planned and laid out gardens. The topiary trees were very decorative and impressive. The huge central lake with Koi fish was also very scenic. This complex is also home to the One Pillar Pagoda.The complex is well worth visiting."

The French architecture is well preserved and the palace ground is beautifully tree-lined (the Mango Lane) and well-kept.

The gardens and small lake are stunning and so quiet and peaceful.There is also a visitors quarters and a bomb shelter that Ho Chi Minh would retire to if the bell was sounded.

The Presidential Palace itself is off-limits to the public; but the nearby Mausoleum, the house that HCM lived in the 1950's with an attached garage (with like three cars inside), his house-on-stilts that he lived in the 1960's with a big lake in front, and the HCM Museum are all open to the public. And after you're done with the \"HCM area\" there's also One Pillar Pagoda nearby which apparently is a very famous temple of Vietnam although it's just a tiny building on a pillar in the middle of a small pond.All the above mentioned places together will take about four hours so it's enough time to do them all in one morning, but I'm not sure about the line for the Mausoleum as it was closed due to a renovation or something when I visited back in September, 2014, but it shouldn't be too bad if you arrive early in the morning like at 7 or 7 30 am when they open.About a 40-minute walk from the Hanoi train station (Ga Hanoi) on Le Duan then turning left onto Dien Bien Phu, just be sure to stay on Dien Bien Phu when you get past Lenin Park and get to like the fork with the big Flag Tower on the right because going that way will take you to the Thang Long Citadel instead of the mausoleum, museum and palace, so be sure to keep walking on Dien Bien Phu as the road bears left from that fork."

You would have already placed your belongings at the very entrance.Worth to check out to know the man. First, you'll see his old house. A simple man with limited amount of possession, by choice. You do see his cars which were all gifts by the Americans and Russians. Second, you'll then proceed to the lake house (or stilt house) where you can to see similar type of setup. It usually consist of a room to sleep, a place to conduct meeting, a place to dine, and a place to read / lay back to think (with a writing table & many books). You'll also observe the strong influence of both Lenin and Marxism in almost all the rooms. Third, is the presidential palace which we are not allowed to enter. It looks very grand on the outside.I left with three questions in mind. One, how much of the preservation is true to the man, or it is kept the way the people want to see him as? Two, which all the books all over in different places, what is he wants a book from somewhere and forget where he placed it? It'll be quite a bummer to try to find that book. Three, the modern generation seem to have forgot or lost the ability to tell the difference between a \"Need\" and a \"Want\".Guards are very focused on their job. They'll make sure everyone, especially the local, kept to the regulations. They are more forgiving to foreigners.Go in the morning to avoid the warm weather and huge crowd. There are many places to sit and chill, and gift shops to buy things. I'd buy their local perfumes because it smells not bad. But I'm still going to many other ASEAN countries so decided to only take pictures and bring back memories. :)"

When we arrived at the gates my mind went back to the last days of the war and a tank crashing trough the gates of the Palace, and here I was in person. I was pleased as we went through the palace that it had remained in the form that it was at the wars end. Our guides commentary was brilliant and we covered every room and floor of the palace and he explained what each room contained and what it was used for. I would recommend using a guide as the commentary brings the place alive as it once was."

The garden was vast, quiet and serene, As I was leaving this place, I witnessed the saddest sight I have ever seen in a place this beautiful. It was a caged peacock with not even enough room to spread its wings. Picture this, that you are only able to stand in one spot which is the center of a hemisphere and turn in circles. If you move a centimeter or two away from the tallest point, you will not be able to stand anymore. I have written to the embassy to no avail. I have contacted AnimalsAsia.org and they have tried contacting the palace with no success. For many days after my visit and for the rest of my time in Vietnam, I could not get that peacock and the sadness that engulfed me out of my system."

The French Colonial Presidential Palace was thought too grand to live in by Ho Chi Minh, so he had a traditional Vietnamese stilt house with only two simple upper rooms built for himself just a few steps away. Here he lived in Spartan simplicity, tending his gardens and feeding the carp in the nearby garden pond. Everything is exactly as he left it, and on display are his motor vehicles, his typewriter, and even his electric alarm clock. The site was mobbed with mostly Vietnamese citizens paying their respect to this important figure of 20th century history. Some reviewers complained of propaganda, but I think I felt national pride more than anything else. I felt a hushed silence imbued with honor and respect for Ho Chi Minh."

Here you can see three cars he was given as a gift from France, China and Russia. There's a picturesque pond next to the residence and on the other side is the House on Stilts. On one of his birthdays, he was given the house as a gift. Earlier in his life, he had spent time with the hill tribes in northwest Vietnam and they used to live in these types of homes, so one was built for him in 1958. In behind that was a bunker. This is part of the whole Ho Chi Minh experience as the Mausoleum is right next door and worth the visit for anyone interested in the history of the country."

They are located next to one another but you can do one and not the other or do both if you choose. For this attraction, you enter the grounds of the Presidential Palace which is full of beautiful gardens and ponds, the old servants' quarters where Ho Chi Minh lived for 4 years and his stilt house where he lived until his death. There were a lot of people so not much ability to enjoy the scenery peacefully and without distraction. You basically walk with the mob through the defined paths to see the various attractions. With that said, though, I still highly recommend visiting. The deep gold and green colors were awesome for photographs and the reflections on the ponds worked well with the camera too. I suggest going with a guide to explain what you will be seeing as there are not many captions or signs to read on your own. It is all outside so be cognizant of the weather when you choose to go. Considering the lines and crowd, I'd make sure to leave at least 1-2hrs to get in and out."

Weird, when one thinks that HCM wanted only to be cremated and have his ashes scattered around his beloved Vietnam.

You are not able to take any photographs inside but once you are outside you can visit the rest of the grounds which show Ho Chi Minh's house where he chose to live, the presidential palace and the beautiful grounds. He truly was a person of the people choosing to stay in a humble dwelling rather than the palace. This tour really gave you an insight into why the Vietnamese people love Ho Chi Minh so much."

The exception is the stilt house where Comrade Ho lived, very sparingly one would think with US bombs being dropped all over. The stilt house and the views through glassed-in doors in his work and reception rooms and garage reveal a man who lived very simply. This site has no bells and whistles, it is very simple in its essence and presentation but nevertheless, is well worth visiting. The security presence here is not as intrusive as at Ho's mausoleum. The tourist shops all the way to the gate are a disappointment in such a historically important site. An area of calm well worth visiting."

The only downside was the crowds. It wasn't so crowded that it was difficult to walk around, but it was difficult to take pictures and stop and discuss aspects of the sites. When in Hanoi, definitely hire a guide and check out the palace, house on stilts, pagoda, and mango road."

There are toilet facilities, but I didn't go in them, so can't vouch for how clean they are.

It is not too hot if you are there morning and because of lot of trees there.An interesting place to learn more about Ho Chi Minh. The site will close at 11.00am for lunch. There are local people waiting outside the exit gate there and asking for your tickets. Once they got your tickets, they will resell to others. I do not mind to give it to them but sometime they are really rude in getting your tickets. It happened to my friend that a person just take his ticket without asking his permission.

You get to see his old house along with the house on stilts that he moved into with a bomb shelter immediate next to it in case this complex was bombed. A big pond sits in the middle of the complex and you do get to see 3 antique cars that Ho used during his time. I would deem visiting this site worthwhile only in conjunction with the Mausoleum but not making an exclusive trip just to see this site..."

The Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum (with his embalmed body still lying in state) and Presidential Palace look interesting from outside, but were closed due to renovations. Instead we went to the beautiful Buddhist Temple, Tran Quoc, which was the best Temple we experienced in Vietnam. It's nearby and worth a visit."

The Ho Chi Minh quarter looks at the life of the father of modern Vietnam, where you visit the Ho Chi Minh Museum, showing where and how he lived. Very hard to take photos into the rooms on display, as they have very shiny windows which reflect. Great photo opportunity of the palace though! When you enter, make sure you get your ticket checked to the right of the gate, as it isn't in line with the path, and the poor man was having trouble with the crowds who were entering. Amusing for us, but not for him!"

There is some explanatory signage but a guide makes the experience more rewarding and I recommend it. A guide costs no more than $40 for the entire day.

The French colonial palace with its columns is impressive \u2013 large, beautifully designed, very yellow. Tourists are not allowed to go into the palace, but it is worthwhile seeing from the outside. When independence came to Viet Nam, Ho Chi Minh chose not to live in such elaborate style, choosing rather to live in an extremely simple 2-room stilt house on the nearby pond. The contrast to the Governor\u2019s Palace is striking. The furnishings in the rooms were also simple, although the antique cars used by Ho Chi Minh and displayed in the area were quite elegant.Again, in contrast to the simple housing in which Ho Chi Minh lived, his imposing mausoleum is huge, tall, with multiple columns, heavily guarded, built to impress. When we visited the area in November 2012, we were not permitted to go into the mausoleum, but the view from the outside was impressive.Also in the area is the one pillar pagoda, an interesting structure and a place many tourists, including the two of us, had our pictures taken. The gardens in the area were very pretty and peaceful. The gardens are not far from the \u201cHanoi Hilton\u201d where US prisoners were held during the \u201cAmerican War, \u201c as the Vietnamese call it.This is a site we would recommend you see, not just for the buildings and gardens, but also for a sense of history of this country."

He was detailed enough to make it seem so real for us and to hear it whilst visiting this place gives us a better feel of what he was telling us. It is a very interesting site to visit. The only disappointment is that Uncle Ho's body is sent to Russia for \"maintenance\" every year around this time so I missed visiting the mausoleum. We were told that the body will be away for 1-2 months every year so I guess it will be next time to get to see it. Even then, it was still nice to visit the places where he used to stay and walked about.

I caught a moto from the old quarter for 30,000 dong and the entrance fee wasn't much more. There is a huge monument or mausoleum built to house the embalmed preserved body of Ho Chi Minh, Vietnams great communist leader. The day I visited the building wasn't open so that was disappointing. I'm sure I was there before 12 noon. Anyway the building itself is fairly over the top and nothing amazing but the walk around his residence when he was in power is very cool. I liked the architecture and the grounds and the lake in which you walk around to view the buildings.. You can imagine him in residence here or sitting by the lake consulting the oracle. Worth a visit and if you time it right hopefully they're not doing maintenance on his preserved body."

He can speaks 29 different languages and he can write at least 6 different languages internationally. He was a genuine & genius. We visited his residential and his house he used to be stayed before we saw his old cars displayed on his residential. And we saw his underground tunnel he used to hide before during war and many more memories on his throne. Highly recommended to all tourists to visit and must see. Thank you!"

You cannot bring your camera in with you and have to check it at the gate as you get in line. I did use my IPhone to take photos while we were outside in line and no one seemed to mind that. I did not take any photos inside.

It's a sort of natural progression after visiting his mausoleum and as many have said here on TA the simple and tranquil surroundings within his residence suggest a quieter and more normal side to such a powerful man. The residence building itself, which we couldn't access, is beautiful. The yellow elevations and architectural style stand out but it is his more simple garden buildings which suggest he was more real. The gardens and central lake area are beautiful and some of the outer buildings where meetings took place site perfectly within their surroundings. Even the few cars which are on display suggest another side to the leader but perhaps these are only a sample of what he actually owned. I thought this place was great and would have been better if the local Vietnamese knew anything about following in an orderly queue and keeping their kids under control. The only down side was we were continually being pushed past and bumped as people couldn't just go with the flow. Overall the place was superb, but wish I could have drifted around on my own."

It's an interesting place, right in the shadow of the very prominent mausoleum is the former residence which is quite grand and very French colonial in architecture. The gardens and ponds are very peaceful. I found his smaller cabin residence more interesting - Ho Chi Minh considered himself one of the people and didn't believe in grand things and gestures, so to see the contrast of the plainer living against the luxurious residence building is interesting. And also the man himself did not want to be interred into a mausoleum, a lot of things seem to go against his wishes and he has an almost \"God like\" status amongst the Vietnamese."

The whole of the mausoleum site is a national monument and looked after by the Vietnamese army. The most simplistic bedroom, study, and work spaces to Ho Chi Min with a striking contrast to the rather baroque palace built next door by the French government general to Indochina in the 1930s.Be prepared to leave your bags behind the door, go through the usual security checking, and take money to buy water once you're inside.

The most interesting aspects of his modest home is the book collection and pictures of Lennon What is unfortunate is the lack of time you have to view his home through the glass walls from outside. You have to stand in a single queue and walk at a fast pace along with all the visitors. The structure was heavily guarded with soldiers in white uniforms that were adorned with badges and metals. Their were no sign cards that were informative. The vintage cars were interesting as they were rare and gifts from France and Russia. You cannot bring a camera onto the grounds. But they do allow a smart phone. My suggestion is to go there before 10am before the tourists arrive. I was there during the government holiday so it was almost all Vietnamese visitors. The most interesting aspect of the visit is to see the North Vietnamese's respect and admiration for their former leader Ho Chi Minh."

Well worth a visit..long queues so go with a tour to get ahead in the queue."

It's obvious that he was a very humble man who decided to live in a small house instead of the presidential palace. There are really two houses where he lived. One is a normal house, and the other is the famous \"stilt house.\" You can look inside the regular house as you walk by, but it's not open to visitors. When we were there, the stilt house could be seen from the outside but there was no access to the inside. The house are all set in a beautiful park behind the Ho Chi Minh pagoda. The flowers and trees are well worth seeing, as are the huge bonzais."

You can go inside Ho Chi Minh's minimalist stilted building if you are prepared to queue for a long time. An argument erupted between one of the soldiers guarding the house and someone in the queue. I don't know what it was over, possibly someone took a photo of something that wasn't allowed. This added an uncomfortable air of tension to the queue. There are a lot of rules when visiting this place, but its hard to know what they are. The only fun part of the visit was the quirky One Pillar Pagoda."

No sunglassses or hats, bags to be left on bus. No cameras or phones. Hands not in pockets. Silence when entering mausoleum until you come out. Follow all instructions by the guards. Usual wait of 20 mins on a good day, hours in the summer. Nice covered walk way which will be good in the hot sun. Lots of people so pre arrange where to meet up after."

With all the hustle and bustle of the big city, a little house on the lake would be where I would settle that's for sure!It's not like Japanese movies like I'd thought. You know how how everything is dark green and then there's a pristine white pavilion. This was more like brown ground and palm trees. like Burma. I got a few ideas for my own house. It's very calming. loved the vege patch."

The dress code is strict - shoulders and back covered, clothes to at least knees etc. You must also check in backpacks, large bags, and water to the free luggage check in. The complex is only open from 830 to around 11am so timing is important. I get there around 930am and join the long queue. All up, it's probably 1km or so of queuing under shaded awning. Luckily today it was busy but we moved forward at a slow walking pace rather than being stopped. It ends up being a scenic and leisurely stroll through the park grounds so it's not too bad.I watch the changing of the guards in their crisp white uniforms, bayonets, and sharply defined steps. Entering the Mausoleum we are gestured by guards to remove hats and be silent. We file through the marblesque tomb past Ho Chi Minh embalmed and under spotlight. He looks rather like a wax figure from Madam Tussaud's. I don't know why people say it's creepy; I thought it was very reverent.I loved the moment when the guards around Uncle Ho changed and two of the young men smiled at each other as they swapped. The young guy struggled for a few moments to swap the smile for a Buckingham Palace guard type look and had to keep his face ducked down; I'm not sure if anyone else noticed.From there, we file outside and follow the path through the grounds. The Presidential Palace is viewed from the outside as is the Stilt House - though the windows are open so that we can view the interior. It looks homey and I can see why it would be more comfortable living there by the lake then in the palace."

Ho Chi Minh was a revolutionary who set about ending the French colonialist's grip on the country after 100 years of them enslaving and exploiting the Vietnamese people until around 1954. Ho's modest living quarters are preserved allegedly as they were when he resided here for 15 years until 1969. It seems the President was fond of Rolls Royces and Peugeots, some of them still aging undisturbed in the garage. There are several buildings which are in good repair, and nicely presented, and visitors can view a number rooms, including Ho's basically furnished bedroom, through the windows and doorways. Lots of people arrive in guided tours, however I found I could make my own way at my own pace, opportunistically eavesdropping on some of the commentary here and there to pick up a little bit of extra information.The impressive stately Presidential Palace, appears to be in good repair and sits nearby, amongst well established well kept gardens, but is not open to the public, being used only for ceremonial purposes. The precinct includes a small artificial lake, stocked with fish and on the far side is Uncle Ho's summer house, a delightful two storey wooden structure which looks almost new, so perfect is it's preservation. The lower floor has no walls on three sides, allowing air flow during the hot season, and upstairs are his bedroom and private office/library, with personal items and authentic furnishings. Wonderful. Take a walk in the whole garden and you will discover some delightful spaces used by the President. You may also seek out an odd underground rest room. Most guards were happy to be photographed and would offer directions and a little information if asked."

The palace and several residences are all housed within the same park, and all of them are really accessible by flat paths, so good for those in a wheelchair. You can't go into the palace, (it's only now used to host visiting dignitaries) and there are stairs into the wooden house, but it's just a simple wooden structure, with nothing to see inside, so it's enough to view it from the outside. The brick structure at the back of the wooden residence is where he died, but you can't go in here either. There are cafes and toilets at the exit.Fine to visit to say you've been there, but nothing overly exciting, except a nice walk around the park, if you can ignore the hundreds of other visitors."

It is a shame that the war time bunkers are not open to the public as this would have been interesting to see this aspect of his life at that time."

But no, they built a huge mausoleum to him. I'm sure he wouldn't have been happy with this.Having said that, for tourists its definitely worth a visit. Unfortunately, we visited on a Friday (closed) and couldn't see his body, but the lake and house behind the Mausoleum, next to the Palace, is actually where he preferred to live. Amazingly simple yet beautiful. Don't miss it."

In any event, on Monday, when next door the mausoleum is closed: silence and dignified grandeur in this place of historical policy in the city center, but shielded from street noise and bustle, which may be due to three things: the rest of the few visitors, the architectural imposing nature of French architecture of the monumental residence of the early 20th Century and not least also the impressive giant trees bathe the entire park as a forest in deep shade. The latter is already out of botanical interest worth a visit! The French construction was not to enter, but a central wooden stilts on the lake, which had been inhabited by Ho Chi Minh, with authentic interiors of his time. At the outlet a few souvenirs or. Devotionalienb\u00fcdchen with Ho Chi Minh-shirts, nostalgic postcards, small flags and busts in all sizes at low prices, perhaps a touching gift for the occasional old soixante home, to general East Asian knickknacks. But all is not intrusive, at least in January. On the edge of the complex Ho Chin Minh museum worth seeing, too, because affording insight into the history of the country's self-representation and his government put up generous. If you already in the park, it's definitely worth the visit."

There is a little story behind this pagoda, which I will leave to your curiosity or your tour guide to inform you. The pagoda is also where locals go to for prayers in fertility."

The mausoleum of Ho-Chi-Minh was closed on Monday, when we did our guided city tour of Hanoi, so after marveling at the building from the outside we went on to visit the complex containing Ho-Chi-Minh's residence. Without being negative about the visit, of course there is understandably a bit of a cult about Ho-Chi-Minh in Vietnam, up to the kind of sandals he usually wore. So, while there is nothing spectacular about the visit, it is a nice walk over the grounds supported by morsels of information about the complex and the life of Ho-Chi-Minh by our guide. Interesting as part of the tour, but no show-stopper."

Tried to explain to him that we only wanted to go to the grounds and not to the mausoleum. Not sure if he didn\u2019t understand us or simply could not understand why somebody wouldn\u2019t want to go to see the body at the mausoleum. We tried again to explain that we only wanted to go to the gardens at the entry gates. No we were told to go in the queue for the mausoleum. No entry fee but closes at 11am. Closed Fridays and Mondays. You need to cover your knees & shoulders. I had to buy a scarf to wrap around me as I had a sleeveless shirt on, skirt was ok as it went past my knees. Hubby was ok in his shirt and knee length shorts. Both of us had thongs on our feet. Seems like we were going to the mausoleum, whether we wanted to or not, just so we could get to the gardens. Trouped past HCM and then at last we could get to the gardens. For Vietnamese entrance is free. For us it was 25,000 dong each You can take photos of the Presidential Palace, but from a distance. You don\u2019t go inside. Then you can walk around to the house where HCM lived & worked from 1954 to 1958, see his office and his cars. The house on Stilts is where he lived and worked from 1958 to 1969. Small and plainly decorated. The grounds are enormous and a huge lake is in the middle of it. There are signs telling you what you are looking at and a bit of the history. No need for a guide. Just as you leave the grounds, this is where you will find the 1 pillar Pagoda, and the museum."

The location of Ho Chi Minh's stilt house is very peaceful and relaxing, which is presumably what it was designed to be, and it is certainly historically interesting to look at the artifacts and imagine them being used by Ho as he planned his campaigns. But the claim that he lived there rather than in the nearby palace (a simple man of the people living in a simple peasant house etc) does not stand up to scrutiny. The only rooms are a bedroom and an office. There is no kitchen and no bathroom. It may well have been his \"shed at the bottom of the garden\" where he like to spend a lot of time but he almost certainly did not live there full-time. But don't let that spoil your enjoyment - it is a relaxing spot to spend some time after the sobering experience of visiting the mausoleum and seeing Ho's embalmed body."

Ours said that the building is in the gothic style. I thought that I misheard and asked him to repeat what he said. I then informed him that it is in a slightly Napoleon and mostly Beaux-Art style. He proceeded to get into an argument with me about how his book said it was gothic. I finally said to him that I lived in Paris and studied architecture, and that before giving his paid customers misinformation, he should do a little research. It was such hilarity that I couldn't help myself but laugh. \"The book said it!\" I still get a good laugh out of it now. Besides the point, the building is great for pictures in the winter because all the mist makes everything grey, so the pictures come out well with the yellow background."

You were only allowed to view it from outside the gates. There was a military style ceremony taking place so this probably explains it.

When you visit the place you'd realize how great Ho Chi Minh was in terms of simplicity of living; reminds you of how Mahatma Gandhi Livid almost the same life. You get to see the simple house in which he lived (though the whole place is spruced up and polished now) the minimalistic things he used and worked with, not difficult to see why people revere him as almost a God. The lake and the landscaping is OK, you get to see the cars he was presented by the Russians, many kinds of trees, only some of them could be identified by our guide, he said they are all presents from foreign countries. If you're going in without a guide, spend some time on the web reading up on the place so you can better understand the stories behind the walk, we wish we had done that before we went in. When we came out, we got to see the army practicing outside a slow motion kind off walk, was a great watch.Your Hanoi tour would not be complete without at least a look see at Ho Chi Minh's Residence."

The old time\u2019s atmosphere is still preserved in this place."

In a very big garden with a lake is this common house, where he lived and hold the meetings. The house is very small, wooden and stand on some pillars. Inside the house there are the original equipments, which Ho Chi Minh used (old phone, desk ...). To see how he lived and work give a small overview about his personality. To walk around the area, his cars are shown (russian) and certainly a souvenirshop offers some nice things."

Tour includes the 2 houses Ho Chi Minh lived in as well as viewing of the cars he owned, a bunker and his garden. Very interesting."

The Presidential Palace is part of the Ho Chi Minh complex, containing the museum, mausoleum, residences, one-pillar pagoda, etc so you'll see it as you walk past. It's a huge French-style building, looks very nice, but Ho Chi Minh didn't live here, it was too big - so he lived next door. The palace is used now for high level people to stay. You can't go inside or get anywhere near, so it's just to snap a photo and move on."

The residence is part of the Ho Chi Minh presidential complex, including the Ho Chi Minh Museum, the Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum, and the Presidential Palace, so if you go for one, definitely worth the short time it takes to see all of the above.The residence is mostly interesting because instead of living at the massive Presidential Palace next door, Ho Chi Minh opted to live at this very modest home, with a carp pond, and a garage for his three old cars. It's a nice place to see in context mostly, so you'll want to visit with a guide who can share with you information about what you're seeing (there are not really any signs to help you along, and when there are, the tour groups maul the front so you can't read them anyway). You also see his later residence, which is the house on stilts like the countryside people have. It's a nice walk-thru, only takes about 20 minutes, not really enlightening without a guide, but a nice part of your visit to the complex."
