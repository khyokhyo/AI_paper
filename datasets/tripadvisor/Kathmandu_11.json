When you visit this place you will see and experience the Nepali culture not only through the buildings and infrastructures but also the people behind the magnificent temples. They often celebrate their festivals in this place and there's a lot of people walking around. If you truly want to get a taste of their local culture, you must visit Basantapur."

Visited the Basantapur Tower on 2 January 2015 , arranged by Outshine Adventures ,with our knowledgeable guide Mr.Prasant.We regret that we didn't write a review sooner ,reading recent reviews here , said that the Tower already reduced to rubble, because of the 25 April 2015 Gorkha earthquake .Now our pictures are just beautiful memories of this magnificent and beautiful place.In our hearts ,we hoped that somehow , it can be rebuild to its original state..The location of the Basantapur Tower is on the South of Nasal Chowk, we managed to climb to the top level , the 9th level , and stunning view towards the Kathmandu Durbar Square.Beautiful architecture , with red bricks , wood and stone carvings , timber reinforced beams."

Yes, it's destroyed to bits, it's impossible to rebuild it back with how the origin is , but what left is the memory, the story and always the nepal people will always keep us reminded of this quake that has happened to them. Let's all together people and visitor all over the world, visit nepal, even more important now then later, to boost their tourism , and most importantly to show them that we care, they are not alone ,never alone, let's together restore the faith in humanity and the pride in what Nepalese believe in . Visit Nepal 2015 people"

It's also a great place for photos as this place is very old and gives you a good flavour of how Kathmandu was in antiquity. All in all a great place."
