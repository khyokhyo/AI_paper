If you can walk up the stairs (any there are a lot) the walk to the tower is definitely worth it.I was very lucky that I decided to walk in on one of the days that there was a service happening. It was beautiful so if you can find out when a service is taking place that will be a bonus.St Isaac's is not a full-on cathedral anymore. The architecture is awe inspring and has been well kept however the cathedral became the centre for anti-religion under the communist regime. There is an amazing history to hear about whether you are religious or not.I tagged on to the one English guide there on the day and he was really informative. I didn't book and was again lucky there was an American couple in need of a guide as well so we joined forces.Definitely worth the visit."

The stair itself is worth seeing and climbing that 200 steps up.The museum inside is not worth the money you pay unless you fancy glossy mid-XIXth cent. kitsch made from expensive materials, or like guides, telling you 200 years old gossip in a really bad English.My recommendation: take the ticket to the viewpoint only - it is much cheaper and really cool."

It is located in St Isaac\u2019s Square. The main dome is over 100 metres in height. It is plated with pure gold. There are sculptures of angels on the dome. The cathedral\u2019s facades are decorated with sculptures and great granite columns are made of single pieces of red granite. It looks awesome. When you enter inside, your jaw will drop. The doors are made of bronze and have beautiful designs on them. The columns within the cathedral rise majestically. They are made of lapis lazuli and malachite. The floor is made of granite. There are paintings by Russian artists and mosaics. A large, brightly colored stained glass window of the Jesus Christ is inside the main altar. The cathedral is open daily (except Wednesdays) between 10.30am to 6pm. During the summer the cathedral has extended opening hours in the period from 1st May to 30th September 6pm to 10.30pm. Admission prices are 250 Rubles per adult and 50 Rubles per child. You pay an additional 150 Rubles to climb up the 300 steps of the colonnade to get nice views of the city. I would recommend visiting this cathedral."

While Saint Isaac\u2019s is Petersburg\u2019s largest, it is also the largest orthodox basilica and fourth largest cathedral in the world, by volume/space under the cupola. It\u2019s dedicated to Isaac of Dalmatia, patron saint of Peter the Great, who was born on the feast day of St Isaac. This is the fifth cathedral incarnation constructed at the same site, which to 40 years\u20141818 to 1858\u2014due largely to the mammoth undertaking constructed on an unsecure foundation which required 25,000 pilings driven into the boggy land. That\u2019s good to know, especially since this basilica\u2019s capacity is 14,000 people. There are 112 stone columns, each weighing 117 tons. Soviets stripped all religious ornamentation, and in 1931 converted it into Museum of History of Religion and Atheism. During WWII the gold dome was painted gray, to keep Nazis from bombing the building. (The gray color blended with almost constant rain clouds.) This worked! Nazis bombed more than a quarter of Petersburg\u2019s historic buildings.As a cathedral/basilica, it exceeds all expectations. As a museum, most art objects have religious connotations. Both aspects are excellent and make this a must-see museum. I was fortunate to be part of a guided tour, so there was much information not readily available to the lone visitor. Enjoy!"

We just paid for the climb up to the top; stairs were easy and not nearly as worn and difficult as many English churches, and the views right over St Petersburg at the top made it all very worthwhile. It put the canals and rivers and various areas into perspective and fun to look down on all the different domes and streets."

As the largest orthodox basilica in the world, it also takes fourth place on the list of greatest volume of space under a cupola.For me, the use of columns overlaid with the brilliant blues of lapis and the brilliant greens of malachite, offsetting the striking rich red of the garment worn by Jesus, that shines brightly from the rear of the Sanctuary thru the open Holy Doors of the iconostasis\u2026\u2026..provides a visual distinction from all other churches I have ever visited. It is a remarkable interior.I wish we had time to climb the colonnade stairway to the roof for the view of the city and presumably placing us closer to heaven."

We joined celebrity Eclipse at Southampton, and traveled to St Petersburg, stopping at Tailin Estonia, Warmondom Germany, Helsinki Finland, Stockholm Sweden, Copenhagen Denmark. We stayed two nights in St Petersburg and arranged two trips, one to a local indoor market to buy food with two of the on board chefs. We then were guided by a lovely Russian girl through the streets of the City, where we had a Vodka tasting session and sample Russian food. It was a great experience, especially on our return to the ship, where that evening the Chefs cooked the food for us in one of the theme restaurants. It was fantastic. The second day in the City we toured Cathedrals, which were extremely busy with thousands of other tourists shoulder to shoulder trying to move around. Our guide was very good, and she tried very hard to keep us all together using the head phone system, which was crucial for communication. Some of our group became nervous of the situation and we're pleased when we returned to the ship. The City in places is very poor, but the Russians albeit tough looking were very friendly and whilst in the Market on the first day, we're happy to barter on the cost of the food with a smile. The whole cruise was wonderful with the other destinations a must to visit. (Not enough space here to go through each City that we visited) A wonderful ship, our 4th time on board. The cost of the excursions have increased dramatically over the past years, with many people complaining about it. You can of course arrange your own excursions, by taking local taxis, or open top tour busses. The entertainment is fantastic on the ship, with many bars to suit all tastes, even an ice bar, where experienced mixologist perform wonders with cocktails. Try and buy a drinks package, because, if like me you enjoy a good Gin and Tonic it will work out very good value. My favourite bar was the Sky lounge on the 12 deck, with panoramic views to the bow overlooking the sea.We could not fault any of the staff at all. So friendly and helpful. If you fancy a cruise and never been before, my advice is to try a taster cruise for two or three days to see if you like it, because it is not for every one. I love the sea, so it's for me and my wife, who enjoys just as much as me. We have cruised with many companies and most are very good to be honest, but with Celebrity you can arrange some good deals direct."

The view from the collonade is absolutely worth paying for - I was there at sunset and got nice pictures where the city shined in golden and red tones. But when I went inside the building - currently a museum - I had a weird feeling. What the Cathedral has to show in opulence, evident in the gold and marble all around you, it seems to lack in beauty. To make things worse, a rather ugly modern art exhibit was covering one of the chapels.If you do not have a lot of time, my suggestion is that you forget the museum and climb to the collonade.PS: if you visit the Fortress across the river, you may be able to take nice pictures where St. Isaac's can be seen. It is quite a view."

Just by seeing the size and beauty of the Bronze doors you know this is going to be huge. The size, opulence and works of art in mosaics are unique.

We had a guide showing us around but sadly, the only historical information we were provided with was 'Peter the Great was born on St Isaac's Day, that's why he dedicated this church to him.'. The rest of the tour was 'We took this material from Finland/Ukraine/wherever and we built this church from it.' which I found highly disappointing. I don't really care where they stole the materials from, and how they built the church. At least I don't care enough to hear about it for half an hour."

There are ticket machines outside, not all seemed to accept cash, which I found out when I was rushing to see it before I had to get back to the port, until I figured out some accepted cards only. It cost RUB 150.00. Because it was a beautiful day it was busy so it might take a while for you to take the shot you want. But worth it. Definitely was a fantastic way to say goodbye to the city. Things to note though, It's closed on Wednesdays and it has different prices depending on what time of day you are visiting. There are evening openings of the Cathedral and Colonnade in the summer but it's good to note it's double the price of the daytime admission. And the Colonnade is open at night for the White nights when the bridges are up and it's RUB 400 (June 1 - August 20). Last admission in the evening is 5.30 and it closes at 6PM for daytime admission. Summer evenings admission 6 pm to 10.30 pm. So pays to check your times."

This is another must-see when in SPB, and like the Church of the Savior on Spilled Blood, it is a museum rather than a working religious building (which means you can take pictures - otherwise prohibited in Russian orthodox churches). The inside is stunning, with colourful paintings covering every inch of the ceiling. If you enter just before ticket sales close (at 17.30, I think), you can enjoy the building with relatively few visitors around in the last few minutes before closing time.Entrance to the top of the building (150 rubles, over 200 steps) is separate from entrance to the museum, and tickets can be bought separately."

It is plated with pure gold and is decorated with statues of angels.The exterior is made of with gray and pink stones, decorated with sculptures and red granite columns.The stunning interior is adorned with incredibly mosaic icons, paintings and columns made of semiprecious stone malachite and lapis lazuli. Everywhere you look you see beautiful paintings, marble, gold, in the walls, in the ceiling and in the floor. Also worth mentioning the chandeliers and the interior of the great dome, honoring the Holy Spirit. A lot of people recommend to climb the 300 steps up to the walkway accessible to tourists located in the cathedral's rotunda of the uppermost dome, to enjoy the magnificent views over the city. My husband and I decided not to climb so many steps. Tip: Buy entrance tickets at the street-level ticket booth located at the right of the tourist information booth, almost at the opposite side of the cathedral entrance. Beware of pickpockets. When my husband was buying the tickets, a young girl well dressed, which was just beside him in the line, unzipped the pouch he takes tied at the waist. Thank God the wind had blown the girl's scarf her toward him and he realized what was happening before he had been stolen."

Gorgeous rich colors and towering structures make it visually very appealing. The book sold inside contains a lot of information about the building and the narrative around this massive and beautiful museum, If you are going to visit, do double check the hours as they are different from the hours that the ticket office is open. On the day we went, the ticket office AND the automatic ticket terminals, were all closed from 530 until 600pm on the dot. It was a very odd part of our visit but we did it. Also remember that it is not a church and admission isn't cheap at around $15 US. The staff either do not speak English or appear totally disinterested in humans even if you want to buy items at the souvenir stands inside."

We visited both the museum and the dome at 6pm (tickets are sold from 10am to 5.30pm and from 6pm to 10pm). The dome entrance costs 300 roubles and the museum 400 roubles. There are machines to sell the tickets both next to the ticket office and next to the main entrance. The Dome offers an amazing view of Saint Petersburg, totally worth to visit. There are 110 stairs so no hurry. You need to exit the dome and go back to the street before going inside the museum. The museum is outstanding. The iconography and the bronze doors are beautiful. Malaquite columns are quite impressive as well."

If you don't have time to visit both this one and the Church on the Spilled Blood, the latter is the better choice. Prices to the colonnade remain the same throughout the day, but the museum does not accept reduced fees for students (ISIC card) and has a higher price from 18h on.

Still, the cathedral was impressive and memorable.We returned this summer and found the cathedral equally impressive.St. Isaac's is one of the largest cathedrals in the world. Much of the size is due to its great height and the large golden dome. The exterior of part of the dome is currently under renovation, but you can still see most of it and the interior is unaffected.While the size is impressive, its the lavish opulence and artwork that makes it especially amazing. It's almost impossible to list the many intricate and grand details - the enormous dome, pillars made of malachite or lapus lazuli, over 150 murals or paintings, stained glass, marble, gold, etc. Together it is awe-inspiring, but take some time to view just a sample of the many details and they are exquisite as well.You can also tour the tower at an extra cost, with its great views of St. Petersburg, although if you are sensitive to heights this may not be for you.St. Isaac's is one of the most popular attractions in St. Petersburg.

Got tickets to the colonnade by accident, having not understood the lady at the ticket booth :) Bit of a shock being confronted with an endless spiral staircase, but....! It was worth it! Nice view of the city and you get a good idea of how St Petersburg is really laid out. It was a little rainy that day but I think on a clear day it would be fantastic! Open late too for nice evening views. Worth a visit!"

This was an expensive church to build. St. Isaac\u2019s was built in the 19th century by the French architect, Auguste Montferrand. It is one enormous cathedral that features incredibly detailed mosaics, icons, paintings and columns made of malachite and lapis lazuli. It also boasts the most impressive views of the city from its dome (you have to climb 300 steps to see this view). The fa\u00e7ade is decorated with sculptures and massive granite columns (made of single pieces of red granite). Within the main altar, there is a large, brightly colored stained glass window of the \"Resurrected Christ\". We were told the church can accommodate up to 14,000 standing worshipers. Admission Fee \u2013 Wheelchair accessible."

This was, for me, the most impressive of the three, with magnificent bronze doors, enormous columns of malachite and lapis lazuli, a glorious set of doors to the Sanctuary. Despite all the religious art etc it still doesn't have that church-like feel, probably because it became a museum in Soviet times, and whilst there are now religious services in part of it, it feels more like a tourist attraction than a place of spirituality."

This is the church whose golden dome dominates the St Petersburg skyline and was built between 1818 and 1858, our guide told us, in a fusion of architectural styles. It is the fourth church of St Isaac to be built in St Petersburg, mainly because Peter the Great was born on the Saint's day. Alexander 1 ordered this fourth construction and 7000 people attended the consecration. The interior is decorated with oil paintings and some mosaics but the plan for much more ornate decoration came to a halt when the Church of the Spilt Blood was begun. The huge columns weigh 114 tons each and are held in place by gravity alone. The icon columns are of bronze and malachite and the dove, 100 meters up, is finished in silver. Although it is now a museum, some services are held in a side chapel. Again there were many people here but it was not such a scrum as in the Church of the Spilt Blood. Perhaps because this church can accommdate 14,000 people standing. As we were on a tour, we did not have time to climb the 300 steps up to the colonnade for views over the city."

The dome of St. Isaac's Cathedral dominates the skyline of St. Petersburg and its gold-gilded cupola can be seen glistening from all over the city even from the outlying and more remote locations of the city.The church itself is an architectural marvel and intended to be the main church of the Russian Empire. Auguste Montferrand, an outstanding French architect, built it. It is the 4th largest cathedral in the world after St. Peter\u2019s in Rome, St. Paul\u2019s in London, and Santa Maria del Fiore in Florence.The columns are amazing and intimidating. They are made of single pieces of red granite and weigh 80 tons each. Inside the church, many of the icons were created using mosaic techniques and the iconostasis (a wall that separates the altar from the rest of the church) is decorated with 8 malachite and 2 lapis lazuli columns. The cathedral can accommodate 14,000 worshipers, but now it primarily a museum and services are held only on significant ecclesiastical holidays.In St. Isaac\u2019s Square, you will see the sculpture in honor of Nicholas I. The sculptor Piotr Klodt was the architect and he was so precise in his calculations that there are only 2 points of support for the mounting of the horse. "

The sheer size leaves an unforgettable impression. Gold is in abundant use throughout. Your eyes are first drawn to the lower stone walls of marble and granite void of icons, then upwards towards the mosaic icons and murals climaxing at the main dome with its vibrant fresco and at the center of the cupola hangs a silver pigeon representing the Holy Spirit. Just as impressive, the incredibly beautiful altar with a huge stained-glass portrait of Christ framed by two massive golden doors and 10 malachite and 2 lazurite columns dividing the portraits of holy figures lining the wall. Bathed in soft radiant light, the interior inspires reverence and contemplation. My husband loved this Church. He kept asking me if I couldn't just feel the omega waves radiating."

The frescos and ornate carvings are incredible and you also have to remember that during WW2 St Petersburg (Leningrad ) went through massive destruction and as the same with Peterhof the restoration work carried out is first class. If you have the legs for it the climb to the top of the building is worth a look but to be honest it not such a great skyline as can be seen of other city's. As I said worth a look but if you have travelled a lot you wont be awed and if its a busy day you will be ducking selfie sticks as you negotiate the narrow walkway."

Once inside, be prepared to be wowed! The Icons are beautiful and are still n use today, please be respectful to those who are praying to their Icon. Where ever you loo, there are mosaics, Icons and pictures, from floor to ceiling, there is beauty to be seen and because it is a museum, they allow photography, I took well over 200 pictures when I was there, Stand under the dome and loo up, even more artwork. Like other Cathedrals, there are dome tours, where you are able to go outside and see St. Petersburg from a panoramic perspective, great if you like heights, definitely not for the faint hearted. Well worth a visit and no matter how many times you visit this building, you will see something new!"

Not only it's amazing from the inside but you can get a nice view on the top over St. Petersburg as well. During approx. Jun 1-Aug 1 (not 100% sure what the exact dates were) the walkway on top of the Cathedral is open until 4 am so you can get a nice view at night or during sunrise. You should go there twice, during daylight and during night time as you cannot get the great view of St. Petersburg during the night."

The outside is grand and dignified, with strong pillars and sculptures, and carved scenes on the gables. The huge doors have religious sculptures and carvings all over them, both inside and outside. And the inside of the church is virtually completely covered in religious paintings. There are side chapels, at least two large mosaics, a dove in the centre of the dome. Wherever you look, each view is different. The building is now seen as a museum, but it was clearly built and decorated as a very grand church."

It's maybe a 10 minute walk from the Winter Palace. Lots of people visit, so there is a long line even if you get there when the place opens for the day. Be sure to buy tickets to climb up to the roof! The interior of the cathedral is opulent and beautiful, with lots of booths where you can buy souvenirs. But our favorite part was climbing the stairs (I don't remember an elevator) to the observation deck on the roof. The entrance to the stairs is outside the cathedral, but it's well marked so you'll find it. It was a gorgeous day for us and the view could not be beat. Walking around the outside of the dome gave you a 360 degree view of the city. Fantastic!"

Saint Isaac's cathedral is located in the admiralty section of Saint Petersburg and is a fine example religious grandeur viewed through an imperial lens. The building is not regularly used for religious services, so it feels far more like a Museum than a place of worship. This also makes it a good place for visiting because it might seem awkward to intrude on people while they worship. The interior is vast an cavernous and is decorated with splendid columns, icons and paintings. If you pay extra, you can visit the colonnade, which is accessed by climbing around two hundred stairs. The effort is worth it though because the platform offers access to a 360 degree unobstructed view of the city."

The able bodied can get a ticket that includes climbing to the outside cupola, from which there are stunning views of this stunning city."

The cathedral -- called the museum, presumably because it stopped being used as a \"full-service\" church in 1928, and even became an anti-religious museum in 1937 -- is a stunning work of art regardless of your religious point of view. The interior continues the rich decorative style with extensive guilding and craftsmanship seen in many Romanov cathedrals and palaces. It was interesting that the cathedral was started in 1818 by Alexander I, demolishing and replaced a previous cathedral on the site that had been completed just a few years earlier, but which Alexander seemed to consider disappointing and unworthy.Access to the Colonnade provides a splendid view of St. Petersburg in all directions, assuming the weather cooperates. You do have to climb (and eventually descend) approximately 250 steps, so be prepared. If you want to visit the Colonnade, it requires a separate admission from the Museum -- buy both tickets at once, so you don't have to wait through the ticket line twice."

In the end of Voznesensky Prospekt (Ascension Prospekt), one of the most important boulevards beside the Nevsky Prospekt in St.Petersburg, is located this gorgeous orthodox temple. That is a largest Russian Orthodox cathedral (sobor) in the city. We decided to see the interior of the Sobor and also to mount to the colonnade for the views of St.Petersburg from atop.The cupola (the dome) is very impressive one and it rises 101.5 metres above the ground. The dome is plated with pure gold and is decorated with twelve statues of angels.The Cathedral is located in Isaakiyevskaya Square where can be seen the famous Astoria Hotel. Before, here in this square was situated the glorious monument to the Peter the Great on the horse, so called the Bronze Horseman, but later was moved closer to the Neva embankments. Also there is an equestrian monument of the Tsar Nicholas I in the front of the Cathedral.The Cathedral is dedicated to the Saint Isaac of Dalmatia, who was the saint patron of Peter the Great.The exterior is faced with gray and pink stone and features 112 red granite columns with Corinthian capitals. The main fronton or pediment is richly ornamented and carved in bronze with the features from the Bible and St.Isaac himself blessing the Roman Emperor.The interior is quite impressive as well, since the volume under the cupola comes as the fourth largest in the world counting among the cathedrals. The main gate or doors are of bronze , then iconostasis is very nice, consisted of the malachite columns, then comes the Shrine to the Wonderwork and Sanctuary with the display of Saint Isaac in the red vestment. If You point out Your glance above, You'll perceive suspended underneath the peak of the dome a sculpted white dove representing the Holy Spirit.Outstanding Cathedral of St.Isaac, here in St.Petersburg, that's for sure."

Designated as a museum during the 1930s, the lavish interior features highly decorated granite and marble columns and pilasters. The main iconostasis is, framed by eight ornate columns. The dome, one of the largest in the world, is covered with almost 100kgs of pure gold. Get there early and beat the hordes."

The most interesting part of St. Isaac's Cathedral is the ascent to the walkway around the cupola, from where the view on a clear day is magnificent. This is certainly worth while. The interior of the church, now a museum, is quite beautiful (one part is currently under restauration and not accessible), but we could not find a shred of information about all the artwork. While the ascent to the walkway costs 300 rubles (about 4,5 Euro at current rate), the entrance to the museum is 400 rubles, which we found a bit exaggerated for the experience. Personally, I thought that there were too many souvenir stalls, even for a museum, at least three, if not four, in a comparatively small space.As to my opinion, St. Isaac's Cathedral cannot compete with the Church of the Saviour on Spilt blood. If I had to choose one for a visit, it would be the latter."

Once out on the exterior of the cathedral, you are met with 360 degree views over the city and also a birdseye view of the building....it is unmissable.However, I would not recommend this part of the visit to anyone with health/fitness issues or young children, as the safety barriers are perfectly adequate but not robust for small children."

The exterior is impressive in scale and, in the columns on one side, you can still see shell marks from the WW2 occupation/siege of the city. It's on the inside, though, as in many Orthodox churches, where the true splendours lie. We particularly liked the bright green and blue columns amid all the splendid decor.We also paid to go up on the exterior colonnade, just beneath the dome, and this was well worthwhile, as there are great views out across the city. We made this visit independent of our tour group and it was not expensive, only a few hundred roubles. One note of caution - the tickets were being sold outside, some distance from the entrances, so this necessitated a far bit of toing and froing and some long queues. Well worth it, though."

My advise is go inside the cathedral and ask the guid about history, he will tell very historical things don't forgot to ask about basilica . You can Also go on the Top of the Cathedral by 269 stairs to definitely worth view at the top looking out over St Petersburg .This is the largest orthodox basilica and 4th tallest cathedra in the world . local people says that makers use 5000 tons of marble used to built this cathedra. Best time to visit early evening for capture best moment form the top of st. petersburg . About entrance fees its 300 rubles for inside view and 150 view for top. you must pay for audio guid worth 100 rubles."

In my opinion it is the best to visit it during the white nights period. If you go inside make sure to ask for a guide, because they will tell you really interesting facts about the basilica. Make sure to ask about the mechanism which opens the huge doors.If you're fit you can climb to the top and there you can enjoy the beautiful view from the top. Because there are lots of tourists, I think that the best time to visit this place is early in the morning so that you can enjoy more time at the top. However during the evening you also make some great pictures from the park in front of the basilica."

Rent an audio guide for two people for only 100 rubles to learn more about how they construed the Cathedral as you view several models on display.one portion of the interior was under renovation/restoration but that didn't hinder the visit one bit.

For 150 extra rubles, you can climb to the top of the Colonnade which I highly recommend. There is 360 degree view of St. Petersburg and you are able to see the entire city. It's actually not a bad walk up the spiral staircase and is enclosed until you get near the top. I believe it is around 260 steps (and they are even marked in increments of 10) with landings if you want to take a break. Definitely worth the climb. The cathedral and colonnade are definitely worth the visit. From a practical perspective, I went on an icy day and the footpath around the entire cathedral had not been salted and was very slippery so be careful if you are walking around on a cold icy day. It may not seem like a big deal but the taxi dropped me off at the front and I had to walk to the ticket booth which was behind and then back to the front to the entrance. The exit to the cathedral is at the back so you have to walk to the front again to climb the Colonnade so another icy trip so just be careful. This is something you simply must put on your itinerary when coming to St. Petersburg."

This cathedral took at least 40 years to build and was intended to be the greatest one in the Russian Empire; however it is still officially a museum today. The interior central dome is very height and magnificently decorated. The paintings are still very well preserved and colorful. We noticed many sculptures and reliefs on the inside and outside of the cathedral, and the many granite columns at the front entrance.A nice photo to take is from the outside close to the Monument to Nicholas I in the center of St. Isaac\u2019s Square facing the cathedral.

This is one of the must-do locations on your 'church day' in St Petersburg, but make sure to go at sunset and get the best views across the city from the top of the 260-something steps to the collonade. It's absolutely the most breathtaking part of the (outdoor) visit. Meanwhile, inside you can view incredible architectural features, stunning mosaics, and beautiful paintings that adorn the walls. Make sure to look up! Particularly at the main dome, the dove at the pinnacle of the spherical painting is really something to behold.As always, I recommend a tour - I just got the audio version and it was great value for your 50 US cents or whatever it is. I also eavesdropped just a little on the English guided tours going around and they seemed strong as well (although probably a touch more expensive). Finally, there are blessings available in the small altar which you can quietly and respectfully view if you're a non-believer. These give you a bit of an insight into the religious practices and are quite interesting to observe."

It's a 262 step climb to the top of the dome (circa 115m high) and it gets very narrow and windy at the top!!

It is the largest Orthodox Basilica and the 4th tallest Cathedral in the world after St. Peter's in Rome, St. Paul's in London and the Santa Maria del Flore in Florence. St.Isaac of Dalmatia was the patron Saint of Peter the Great, as he was born on the day that this Saint was celebrated. Built from 1818 - 1858 by French architect Auguste de Montferrand, it was ordered by Tsar Alexander I and the cost reached the amount of 1.000.000 gold rubles, six times more than the cost of the Winter Palace! The 40 years of construction left an expression in the Finnish language - To build like St.Isaac's Church - meaning something that never ends. In 1931, after the Russian Revolution, the building was stripped from all its treasures and became The Museum of Atheism! The dove symbolizing the Holy Spirit, was replaced by the Foucault pendulum according to Copernicus' theory. In 1937 it became the Cathedral's Museum and remains a Museum up to now. Only exceptional religious services take place here from time to time. The design and especially the Dome, influenced the building of the United States Capitol, the Wisconsin State Capitol and the Helsinki Cathedral.There are 112 red granite Corinthian pillars around the building. The portico columns were raised using wooden frameworks, a model of which is displayed inside the Cathedral.14.000 people may stand in the interior that covers 4.000 sq.m. 400 kg of gold, 1000 tons of bronze and 16 tons of malachite, 43 kinds of minerals and 14 different marbles were used for the decoration. The mosaics cover 600 sq.m. surface.24 angels by Josef Hermann surround the Dome, 101.5 m high and fully covered by 100 kgs of pure gold. The bronze doors of each entrance with reliefs by Ivan Vitali are designed after the Baptistery in Florence.If you have time, you may climb the 262 steps, at an extra cost, to the colonnade walkway to have an unforgettable view over St.Petersburg."

Notwithstanding that I strongly recommend visiting this building.One thing I did find of all the major tourist attractions in St. Petersburg was they have DVDs available in a number of languages available with both high quality photography and excellent descriptions of all aspects of the building. I made a collection of these DVDs that I am going through now that I am back in Australia.

I only rented them once during my trip and was very disappointed in that only superficial info was available on the tape.

In the museum, there is a gift shop, where there were beautiful gold art of different saints for sale.

The carved metal and wooden doors are very detailed, and depict a lot of historical events.Inside there are inlaid mosaics, sumptuous paintings, mosaic floors, and carved art sculptures made of precious and semi-precious stones. The massive stained glass window of Jesus at the rear of the Church is absolutely stunning \u2013 to say the least.The Golden Dome is phenomenal from the outside, as well as from the inside.

It was the tallest structure in St. Petersburg. Massive columns in front, ceiling frescoes and walls with lavish mosaics are the reasons to go. Inside, scale models of the Cathedral's designs - small to current, as well as model showing how the columns were erected are also interesting."

It was located in one of the best part of the city and near most of the good hotels of the city, and also in a walking distance from Hermitage Museum.You can see the golden dome of the building even from far away, no wonder it has the reputation of the greatest cathedral of the whole Orthodox world. In front of the cathedral lies the great statue of Peter the Great with his three daughters (if I am correct, fingers crossed).St. Isaac used to be a operative cathedral, but in the Communist era under Stalin it was changed into a museum for religious and atheist people. After 1991 it started working again as both meusem and operative church. However, as of 2015, it is not working anymore. When we got there it was closed for some unknown reasons, later when I passed by it I saw people were frequenting inside and outside of it.I guess the builders of Uinted States Capitol has taken sufficient inspiration from the architecture of this Golden Dome House of God."

What distinguishes it however, is its massive size inside and out. This is not to say it is not beautiful, just that it lacks the magnitude and number of mosaics seen in other churches. Since Russian Orthodox churches do not allow paintings, decorations are generally mosaics. St Isaac's Cathedral breaks the general rule as it has one large stained glass window which is quite beautiful. Don't miss the scale model of the scaffolding demonstrating how the massive columns were put in place with benefit of machines. It's located in a corner to the left of the entrance.

The admission price increases after 18:30, so if you are in a budget try to go earlier. However, is slower during the evening so its nice to avoid the masses. To climb the Colonade is a MUST DO! If you do only one thing, skip the museum and do this one. Gives you a great bird's eye view of the city!!!"

St Isaac's is truly remarkable in terms of its sheer size, its interior design, the color and detail of its walls and ceilings. Our guide was very knowledgeable about the cathedral and its constructions - undertaken over 10 years - including 5 years to lay the foundations to support the immense weight of the finished cathedral. Inside the cathedral there is a wooden 166th scale model of the cathedral in exquisite detail. We were told the carpenter (a serf) took 10 years to carve the model - his reward for completing the model was his freedom. Plan on spending a good couple of hours here to get the most out of your visit."

When we moved into our hotel, the Hotel Angleterre, St Isaac's was right across the street, so we had lots of time to explore it. We started by buying a ticket that lets you walk up 292 steps to the observation platform that wraps around the outside of the dome of the cathedral. Once up there, the view of the city is fantastic. Walking around the platform around the dome gives you a 360 degree look at the city of St Petersburg. I was with my wife, and it seemed as though everyone was offering to take picture of both of us, with the city view in the background. Once this happened to us, we were the ones making the offers to take pictures. Just make sure you are in shape to go up the winding staircases and the final straight stretch of stairways that goes up the final 60 feet or so.Inside the cathedral (with a different ticket to et in) , you will see beautiful artwork, statues, ceiling paintings and a wonderful floor. The tour guides, if you booked one, provide detailed descriptions of the cathedral, which is now a museum, but is used or services several times a year."

If you are already visiting Church of the Savior on the Spilled Blood and the Peter and Paul Cathedral, you should feel absolutely free to skip this one."

They also have a lot of painting on huge inside that are actually mosaic as the weather destroys paintings. The alter is very impressive with a gray stained glass of Jesus. It is not a working church so you can wear shorts etc. It is definitely a must visit for St Petersburg."

If religious sites are not your thing, this is still worth a visit to walk up the 210 steps to the base of the colonnade around the dome. The views are 360 and give a clear sense of the layout of St Petersburg. That said, beware the lines again. Queuing at the ticket booth is old school: a scrum to get into the shortest line. If you do both the museum, that is the church interior, and the colonnade, be prepared to walk around the building twice because oddly one the exits of both attractions are the rear and the entrance to both are the front. and the ticket booth is at the rear too."

If you're only in St. Petersburg for a couple hours or less than a day, make sure this is one of your stops in the city.St. Isaac's cathedral is amazing outside and in. The architecture of the cathedral and its massive dome was historical at the time. You really don't appreciate it's size until you get inside. The walls are completely decorated with paintings and frescos, although to many of the frescos are now being recreated as mosiacs, but it's still amazing.The colors and designs inside cannot be expressed in words and this is also one of the few cathedrals in St. Petersburg that has stained glass.You will be blown away by this cathedral and it's on our list as one of the beautiful we've ever seen in the world."

One of the most interesting things about St. Isaac's are the mosaics which were designed to replaced the original painting decoration. These carefully crafted mosaics are indistinguishable from paintings until you are right next to them. The entire building is astoundingly grand."

Everything about this church is massive. The interior can hold 5000 people. Inside at either end of the church there are pairs of 20 ton carved wooden doors. Only a small alcove is used for Orthodox services now. If you want to go in that part, women must cover their heads. Since this is essentially a museum now there are displays with history on how the church was built, etc. I say do not miss this site"

There was a big problem with the machines not accepting almost pristine bank notes which was driving some people, understandably nuts. You can use your credit/ debit card but don't forget to get the tickets which are dispensed under the key pad. The climb to the top isn't really arduous and the views worth it. There is a hairy bit at the top both going up and down, not for the nervous. If you are caught for time I didn't think the interior was as spectacular as other cathedrals in terms of atmosphere (Kazan Cathedral, Monastery of Alexander Nevsky)."

They charge separate entry prices for the cathedral interior, the colonnade and audio guide for the interior (by the way - the English version is narrated by Toyah Wilcox!), which is available in several languages and well worth it, as it is very comprehensive. Apart from the golden dome the rest of the exterior of the cathedral looks almost drab and severe compared to the Church of the Saviour on Spilled Blood, but the interior offers some serious competition. This church had fantastic marble and stone interiors with sumptuous paintings, mosaics and floors. The stained glass window of Jesus at the rear of the church is gorgeous and rear lighting genuinely makes him glow behind the main altar. Once you have exited the church, take the just over 200 steps up to the colonnade and enjoy the breathtaking views of the city, you can hire binoculars if you wish when buying your tickets. Plan for a whole morning or afternoon and take your time. You won't regret visiting and like with all St Petersburg attractions, the summer will be crowded and expect to queue for tickets. You will be rewarded with a fantastic attraction however."

A minimal entrance fee is collected which is very reasonable considering the spectacle that can be seen inside. Photography inside the cathedral is allowed. The interior of the cathedral is even more marvellous than the exterior. The columns, pillars and beams are made of granite and marble. There is gold decor everywhere including on the icons.

There are two separate tickets available, one for the colonnade and one for the museum, or 400 rubles for both, well worth it.The colonnade is a fair old climb, around 300 steps according to the leaflet, however the views are great. The exterior is undergoing renovation currently but you get a close-ish look at the great bells and roof architecture as well.At ground level do not let the term museum put you off. If you ignore the multiple attempts to sell you tourist trinkets there is a fantastic history of the Cathedral, from the new building techniques it involved, with great models and pictures showing the history. I read TA which said there was a free tour so I tagged on to an American couple as they were the only ones speaking English and nobody seemed to mind. I could spend an hour looking at the great doors alone, at 20 tonnes each they must be one of the largest moving works of art? One you have walked around do it again looking up all the time. This is just spectacular, fascinating both in scale, talent and opulence.This is more of a museum than an Cathedral (see the history as a centre of anti-religion in the earlier 20th Century) however the Orthodox church have permission to perform rituals on special occasions. I was lucky enough to see the Easter blessing and it was amazing. I am not a member of the church but appreciated the beauty of the service."

It is the largest orthodox basilica and the fourth largest cathedral in the world. Today it serves as a museum, but since June 1991, the church community received the authorization to conduct services on special days. Built during the years 1818-1858, by the architect Auguste Montferrand in the late classicism style, the cathedral majestically rises above the city. By visiting the cathedral, many tourists admire the beauty of the interior decoration and the unique collection of monumental paintings of the first half of XIX century (150 panels and pictures). An unforgettable impression leaves the stained glass window in the main altar, depicting the Risen Savior - this is the first stained glass window approved and designed in Orthodox churches."

This time it seemed to me as a Pantheon to what money can buy, artists can achieve and architects design - and how 60 spray painters can die spraying the dome with gold. Now I am no way religious, but this building that took 40 years to complete, and as many Tripadvisors comment - is a selling place for Souvenirs. It may be the largest Russian Orthodox cathedral in the world and the 4th largest Cathedral world wide - but to me it just looks like a big lump of art - not something built with loving hands for people to \"love their neighbor.\" Ask the Russian neighbors of Ukraine. They seem to be missing the point somehow. But since Russia were last to free their Surfs,I guess it is going to take some time. Unfortunately.Brian, from Perth. W. Australia."

All that gold, the extraordinary craftsmanship in those magnificent malachite and lapis lazuli pillars, the sheer opulence of the place, the thought of the conditions people worked under and how many of them must have been needed all raised contradictory emotions. It may be a museum today, but small side chapels are still being touchingly used as a place of worship by ordinary people. We did not \"do\" a guided tour, but simply wandered around absorbing what interested us most, and I think this was wise."

Occupying a privileged position bordering a square that contains a dramatically carved equestrian statue of Tsar Nicholas 1st, and facing the Mariinsky Palace, this large neo-classical structure with its extravagant gold-leaved central dome surrounded by 4 smaller domes, and built over a 40-year period in the first half of the 18th Cent., would be completely out of place in any Russian city other than the very non-Russian St. Petersburg. Its enormity and architectural style echoes that of the Kazan Cathedral, both of which stand in stark contrast to the Church of Our Saviour with its colourful onion-skinned roof, but it is decorated as profusely and ostentatiously as the latter. Regrettably, it lives a schizoid existence: most of the interior space functions as a hangover from the Soviet era when it was one of the country\u2019s many Museums of Atheism, and less than half is used for religious services. The exterior has some stunning sculptures and friezes, notably above the main entrance on the corner pediments and as well as a large door carved in the Florentine manner. There are also 24 splendid statues surrounding the main dome that can be more intimately viewed when you take the highly recommended walk up the steps to the base of the dome itself, and treat yourself to some stunning views of the city. A further 24 statues adorn the rest of the roof but are hard to visualize in their entirety. Once inside, the huge ribbed dome is the outstanding attraction, its cupola beautifully painted at the top, and below its glass windows there is a circular \u201cgallery\u201d consisting of 12 striking statues alternating with 12 beautiful frescoes of saints and prophets. The roof over the alter is occupied by an awesome painting of The Last Judgment, and the chancel contains a dramatic stained glass window of the Resurrected Christ in flaming red attire. The Spanish Chapel is a gem not to be missed, as is the little chapel containing the Tikhin Icon ----one of the most beautiful work in this genre that I have ever seen. The Iconostasis is a beautiful construction, containing ---- among many notable elements --- a series of pillars made of semi-precious stones such as jasper, malachite and porphyry. To comprehend the treat in store, you have to know that the building is supported by 112 Columns made up of 14 different types of marble; 350 sculptures by Russia\u2019 greatest artists and many foreign craftsmen of distinction; and that the entire structure contains 400 kg of gold. On the practical side, you will need separate tickets for the general entrance and for the ascent to the dome, and they are purchased in two different locations. Wednesday is closing say, but the Church is open from 10am \u2013 7 pm on the other six. I am not sure about the Museum component, but when we were there, the overall themes --- very well presented in photographs and narrative ---- dealt with the history of the church in its many incarnations, and the nature of life in Leningrad (as it then was) during the Nazi invasion."

You can not miss this cathedral because is considered the largest in Russia.This alone makes it worth a visit.Technically it is a museum as it was during the communist regime.Things not to miss from outside:the red granite columns, the south doors ,statues of the Apostles on the top of the cathedral (four of them at each corner) and the Dome.My review will refer only to the Dome (I did not visit the interior)The Dome is accessible by climbing almost 300 stairs.At the beginning it seems a lot but the climbing is easy.The stairs have numbers so you can follow your approach to the top.There is a fine view and a close one towards the angels mentioned before.After arriving to the top you will have a breathtaking 360 degrees view across the city including of course the Neva river.The climbing is open till the late hours of the day adding more color to the view at late evenings .It is said that the view is even more beautiful around dusk during the winter.There is a separate entrance to the Dome and another to the interior of the cathedral.It is situated just behind the Admiralty, conveniently close to all main attractions of the city."

The cathedral is the fouth largest cathedral in the world, and it took 40 years to build, from 1818 to 1858. It's main dome rises 333 feet and is plated with pure gold. The interior is lavishly decorated with mosaics, icons and columns of malachite and lapis lazuli. Most of the paintings were removed when they began to deteriorate due to the cold, damp conditions inside the cathedral. They were painstakingly reproduced as mosaics. This work was never completed. The meticulous and detailed work on constructing St. Isaac's Cathedral left an expression in the Finnish language that means \"to build like St. Isaac's Church\", for lengthy and never-ending projects."

You must pay about /450 rubles (11-13\u20ac) in orden to see the Church and to climb up the tower ( about 200 steps with NO LIFT ) from where you can get extraordinary views of San Petersburg.

Also, both places charged 250 rubles, and it was felt that in comparison, St. Isaac's doesn't seem 'worth it' as there was considerably less to see, but the comparisons may not be valid. St. Isaac is beautiful in its own right as a traditional Cathedral.If you've got time, be sure to see it.

There are no seats so everyone stood during the 1-2 hour services, even the Czars.

Unlike many European cathedrals I've seen. the one is not morose with a dying Jesus bleeding to death on the cross, but more vibrant.

It was jaw dropping beautiful inside. Huge reddish streaked marble columns formed arches through which we walked towards the center of the church. These arches were surrounded by gilt trim and the inside of each arch was painted with biblical figures in bright blues and reds on a gold background. At the front of the church, on each side of the altar screen, were quite a few fluted green malachite columns which separated the life sized mosaics of biblical figures. The door of this tall gilt altar screen was open so we could see the altar and behind it a huge stained glass window of Jesus done in brilliant colors like blues, reds, and white. The huge main dome in the center of the space featured a dove soaring into the sky which was to symbolize the Holy Ghost/Spirit. The dove was surrounded by beautiful colored paintings of biblical figures. It didn't matter where we looked in either of the 2 naves or in the central part, we saw beautiful ornate details, much gilt trim, marble columns and mosaics of biblical figures. The tall massive heavy black doors have sculptures on them, making them more interesting. Like in other Russian churches, there are no pews or rows of seats in this church because it is not a working church. Inside there is a gift shop. This church represents more Western church architecture than Russian since it was styled after St. Paul's Basilica in Rome. Outside the entry, the red granite columns are massive and are repeated higher up around the dome. Many sculptures of biblical figures surround the gold dome and decorate the pediments as well. Our tour guide bought our tickets so there was no line up for us. Expect crowds as it is a major sight in St. Petersburg."

Well worth seeing and spending time marvelling at its huge dome, the fine paintings, the sense of space and of peace. And the views from the Colonnade around the outside of the base of the dome are amazing - right the way across the city in every direction, and it's open till 11.00pm in summer - when of course it's still broad daylight. You do have to pay for a separate ticket though, and NB that there are around 230 steps to climb to reach the Colonnade level though they're wide and fairly easy. And don't forget after leaving the cathedral to walk across the road towards the river Neva to enjoy the gardens by the Decembrist Square and to view the statue of the Bronze Horseman."

The extra cost to see the city from atop was more than worth it."

You can see the Cathedral from the bus as you\u2019re approaching it - it is majestic with golden turrets. Once inside it has a very good art collection and excellent murals. Unfortunately, we found it difficult to appreciate the numerous works of art because the cathedral was overwhelmed with visitors. But; we enjoyed the visit. And, because of time constraints, we did not have an opportunity to visit the top of the cathedral; which was perhaps OK because it was raining. If you have time please consider spending at least 1 to 2 hours here; that should be sufficient.Tip: If you\u2019re interested in viewing the surrounding area from the top of the cathedral (which I believe is an extra charge), please consider going there on a sunny day; which we were told does not happen often in St Petersburg."

But it's a pittance, really, and, if your heart's up for it, the view is spectacular.It's a bit of a thriller, too, because you walk across long, metal-grated walkways for the 360-degree panorama over the city and the Neva River.If you weren't into prayer before, you might think about it going up."

The audio tour was well done and made you see things that you would have missed otherwise. There are plenty of seats strategically placed for admiring the inside of the dome.

In order to take photographs there is a small charge. Our guide collected this on board the coach before we arrived. We were asked for 3 euros for photos or 5 euros for video. The guide will mention euros or dollars. I had changed some money into Roubles so asked the guide to pay in Roubles . She took 100 roubles . This did cover all the churches we visited. The guides will take roubles if you ask them. On arrival it was very very busy but the guides give you headsets. One does have to move rather quicker than I would have liked.It is the largest Russian Orthodox Cathedral and its gilded Cupola can be seen from all over the city - it is now a museum and only holds services on significant ecclesiastical holidays and is in front of a square with a large monument to Nicholas IThe Dome is 101 metres plated with pure goldThe Bronze Doors are covered in reliefs similar to those on the Bastillero di san Giovanni in FlorenceInside many of the icons are created in mosaics, fourteen different colours of marble, many precious stones, and artists of the time such as painter Karl Briullov and sculptors Ivan Vitali and Peter Clodt collaborated to create the most striking decorations Inside the dome is a striking fresco depicting Maria surrounded by saints and at the centre of the fresco hangs a silver dove with a wingspan of 263 ft - this represents the Holy GhostThe walls are decorated with magnificent frescoes and mosaicsAbsolutely beautiful but unfortunately very busy when we visited, however, not to be missed."

With its 100 meters high, its 4000 square meters, its big golden dome surrounded by 4 small ones, it took 40 years to complete the construction (from 1818 to 1858). Apparently, it is considered to be the third biggest church in the world after St. Peter's Basilica in Rome. Unfortunately, we only stopped for a few photo shots, so we could not visit the inside. Nevertheless, the building is by itself, something you would want to see during your visit in St. Petersburg. The place is very touristic with buses for guided tours. So, you might want to do just the same if you wish to see it. Those able to visit the inside can also borrow the stairs that lead to the middle top. On a hot sunny day, we were actually glad we did not have to do that! The structure is quite a monument with more than 350 beautiful sculptures all around it, exposing their finest details. Even if for a short stop, it is worth it!"

We had seem some impressive churches in or travels, particularly the baroque churches of Austria, but with the exception of Gaudi\u2019s La Sagrada Familia in Barcelona this would equal anything we have seen bearing in mind we have never seen Saint Peters in Rome.The malachite and azurite columns, the general artwork and quality of marblework and brass work on the gates had us looking in wonder for hours.Strangely we spent more time here than the Church of Spilled Blood but we did spend quite a bit of time uo top looking out over Saint Petersburg."

I visited in September 2013 with a business colleague who has some walking difficulties.As I found throughout my visit to Russia in general municipalities are not over accommodating for disabled people. There is a clear absence of wheelchair ramps and elevators or lifts to assist them in special attractions.Having said that my colleague was able to ascend the stairs, if somewhat slowly, and get into the inside of the building which is a very, very worthwhile visit.I shot off around the corner to purchase the tickets which are around 300 Rubles per person so it's quite cheap to get in and then I took off for the 300 stair climb to the top of the building!! This certainly accounted for my gym for the day!Beautiful views wait at the top and it's one of my great joys in the journey of life to view cities from the highest possible peaks.Once back down and in the building what can one say other than WOW!I was extremely impressed with the beauty of the biblically depicted scenes particularly of the resurrected Christ being almost a center piece in one of the biggest arches. I was sad to see so many great churches that were once functioning houses of worship are now just simply museums.However that being said as non-functioning churches the rules for entrance and what you can do inside is a little more relaxed so you can take a lot of photographs and get into some of the buildings that you wouldn't be able to do if they were still functional.The inside of St Isaac's Cathedral is just simply one of the most impressive works of art that you will ever see anywhere in the world.Renovations and care for the internal side of the building has been kept at a high level so kudos to those responsible for this!One could easily spend an hour inside the cathedral just embracing and taking in the beauty of the mosaics and the artwork. I enjoyed the fact that there is adequate natural lighting inside to help with a simple camera to produce some really beautiful photographs.On a practical note there are no restrooms in the area but there is one outside across the road but it is not free, you pay a small amount of 3 Rubles to make use of the facilities which is well worth it if you need it!All in all one of St Petersburg outstanding attractions and whilst it is looking a little shabby due to age and perhaps pollution on the outside, the interior is simply off the charts!In my opinion, this is a definite visit during your time in St Petersburg!"

This means that there is not a strict dress code and you can take photos to your heart's content, it does however leave it with a certain \"coldness\"; no ranks of glowing candles in front of the icons, no priests chanting in basso profundo."

The other three are Smolny Cathedral, Church of the Savior on Blood and the St Sampson`s Cathedral. Most of the churches and cathedrals we visited in St. Petersburg are no longer used for its original purpose but are magnificent museums. After the October Revolution of 1917 the cathedral was converted into a museum. You can spend 10 minutes walking (900 m / 0.56 mile) from the State Hermitage Museum to St. Isaac\u2019s Cathedral and enjoy these two museums in the same day.The construction of the St. Isaac\u2019s Cathedral took 40 years from 1818 to 1858 by the order of Tsar Alexander I. Reaching 101.5 m (333 ft) in height, the cathedral's enormous 25 m (83 ft) diameter main dome, one of the largest in the world, is covered with 100 kg (220 pounds) of pure gold and dominates the city skyline. When you approach either entrance, you can see the giant red/brown granite pillars. Those pillars are 18m (60 ft) tall and 2 m (7 ft) in diameter. Inside the cathedral is awesome as well. The decorations used expensive, various color marbles and semi-precious stones. When you look up at the dome, you can find Maria surrounded by saints on the beautiful fresco. You will immediately notice a silver pigeon in the center of fresco. I had to wait until I could find the exactly center to take the photo of the wonderful painting. The walls were decorated with magnificent paintings and mosaics. The iconostasis was decorated with green and blue columns, and there was a large stained glass window, the \"Resurrected Christ,\" inside the gilded bronze Royal doors of the main altar. Beside the doors were mosaics with a gilded sculpture of Christ above the door. That is why it took another sixteen years and lots of money to decorate the interior before the grand opening in 1858.This was our last visited attraction after 2 days\u2019 travel of the amazing city - St. Petersburg. Although we were only there for 2 days, we managed to see 7 of the most popular attractions in the city. I do believe there is so much more to see in St. Petersburg, and we will return in the future. I also hope that they can provide at least English, or better yet, Chinese - the most spoken language, descriptions on the displays beside Russian. With that, I believe more people will learn more about Russian history and culture."

Inside you can see very nice golden decorations and paintings and if you go to the Colonnato(you need a different ticket for it and you've to go out and enter from another entrance for it) walking through more than 200 steps you reach the Colonnato around the cupola from where you can have nice views of the city."

It is well worth anyone seeing for the art. For the spiritually-minded, it is an inspiring place with a moving history. For the physically able, I highly recommend climbing the 200+ steps to the Colonnade level. The panoramic views are incredible, and it is fascinating to see the angels, who seem moderately-sized at street level, in their fullness... It gives perspective to how high the dome rises. I will likely climb up every time I go to St. Petersburg, to see and document on film this gorgeous city."

Over the years I have had the opportunity to visit many many churches and not many could match this one in outright audacious splendour.

Because St. Petersburg was basically built on a swamp, it is a city that does not have the sort of skyscrapers that many other major cities have. So that makes St. Isaac's all the more amazing, the way it dominates the St. Petersburg skyline.I would recommend seeing St. Isaac's at the beginning of your stay in St. Petersburg. Then, for the rest of your trip, you can look for St. Isaac's from wherever you are, and you will see it. You will begin to think of St. Isaac's as a \"friend,\" and by the end of your trip, you will share some of the sentiment that St. Petersburg residents have for the great and noble structure. The gold dome is enormous, and only a couple of world cathedrals have a larger dome. The artwork is world class. The view from the top level (the cupola) is breathtaking. And after spending some time there, you will feel a sense of respect and reverence, and understand the special feeling that locals have for St. Isaac's. It is no surprise, when you meet some of the middle aged locals, to learn that when the communist era ended, many of these Russian Orthodox believers renewed their marriage vows at St. Isaac's.Like St. Peter's in Rome and St. Paul's in London, St. Isaac's has world significance far beyond its tremendous religious importance."

Compared to a lot of drab European cathedrals and churches the Russian version is very colourful. The colour came from all the icons on the walls. Initially I thought that they were paintings however I later found out that they are mosaics because the weather is so damp in St Petersburg that paintings would deteriorate very quickly. Magnificent and well worth seeing."

It has a couple of real advantages therefore: you can enjoy its beauty without fear of trespassing on someone's devotions and it stays open very late in a city where there are so many other things to see and do. When we were there it was open until 10.If you have time and energy you can climb to the top of the cupola for views over the city, but the day we went it was raining so we chose that as an excuse not to climb the 260 stairs. This stays open to 4am.The surrounding area is also interesting and worth a wander.We enjoyed the cafe called Happiness (in English) on a corner opposite."

Although built as a cathedral, St Isaac's was never re-consecrated after the Soviet era, so it's not a functioning church and is now, in fact, a museum. This means it is open for visitors in large numbers and at times when a church wouldn't be open to the public (i.e. during services and weddings). It also means there is no hushed, reverential silence or any need to dress conservatively, as is expected in a church.The artwork and decor is impressive, and the internal architecture is overwhelming in size and scale. The lack of church furniture (seating, etc) creates an even greater sense of space.Expect long queues at times though, as it's very much on the coach-party trail. It stays open quite late at evenings, which is the best time to go. Excellent views from the top of the dome, if you can manage the 262 steps up to the top!!"

Lots of souvenirs are also for sale.The entrance to the colonnade walk requires you to return to the ticket area and ascend via a staircase to the right hand side. The walk up was fairly straightforward, with mostly even steps which were easy to climb. The steps counted down as you climbed, so you knew how many more steps were required to get to the top (which our 5 year old child enjoyed). The views from the top were amazing, with a 360-degree platform to take everything in. We visited in the late afternoon, which was nice. We were intrigued to see that the Colonnade Walk was open until 4am, presumably to see the nightscape of the city during the summer months!"

I recommend this wonderful stop on your visit here in St. Petersburg!"

You can also pay to walk the 200 plus steps up to the colonnade. It is a tiring walk up the steps, but at the top you have a nice view of the many site in downtown since this is one of the higher points around. You have a very good view of St Nicholas Cathedral in the distance (the blue & white cathedral). On our first day it rained a lot at the top so we had to go back today while it is sunny. So much better with sun. Almost not worth paying to go up if it is raining. The cost to go up is 150 rub. Unfortunately they have construction with scaffolding and tarps on almost all side and some of the top sides so photos of the beauty of this place is difficult. Inside is more pleasing to the eye."

At the top of the stairs, there are two narrow bridges to the central area...one for entry and one for exit....make sure you use the correct one when leaving, or an ancient crone \"jobsworth\" will appear from a little wooden shed, and shout at you !

It really gives you a taste of how magnificent is St. Petersburg. Watching the rooftops of the city definitely gives an idea of the tough history of the city, and the struggle to maintain the cultural history through harsh times. The church itself is beautiful on its scale and composition. Orthodox mosaics dominate the altar, but I particularly liked the beautiful dome with a representation of the Holy Spirit in the form of a 2 meter dove. Something not very common."

Our tour guide spoke well about these pillars of malachite and those pillars of lazurite. Technically it is a marvel, but one story floored me. The exterior dome is coated in gold. Mercury was used in the process of applying it, and perhaps 60 to 100 people were to die from making it. I could not get my head around this death-toll.Perhaps they died long afterwards, perhaps no-one realized how poisonous the mercury would be. I was left reeling, appalled at this exercise in deliberately brutal gigantism. A Tsar wanted a dome bigger than everyone else's. He wanted gold, where others were copper. He wanted everything about this church to scream of scale, and expense. Well, it did that, at the expense of too many lives."

It really is a gem of an attraction in a city which has lots to see and do."

Even though it is a museum, it also retains religious functions, so a moderately reverent atmosphere pervades the building. Women do not need headscarves in the museum portion, and the active area is roped off for the believers. The iconstasis is remarkable and the view of the central dome from the center of the cathedral is gorgeous. There are a few fun exhibits, but the real treasures are the icons. If you do not like religious art, consider the colonnade. If you do not like religious art or staircases, then this isn't the nightclub you're looking for. Personally, I love religious art and the treasures here are some of the best in the world. See this along with Kazan Cathedral and Church on the Spilled Blood for the St. Petersburg cathedral trifecta."

There was also a collection of photographs depicting the history of the cathedral, which was interesting. I did not climb to the colonnade, but on a clear day the view is probably incredible. I don't think a tour guide is necessary. In fact, it is probably best to go alone and enjoy the place at your leisure."

The audioguides are excellent and not expensive. Do not take a tour to visit. They take you very fast and the information they provide is incomplete and frequently erroneous. You have to spent time inside! That is why you have to do it independently. Also go to the collonade. You have to pay another ticket but the views are very nice and excellent for pictures! They church is also open late at night. It is very empty but the ticket is more expensive. Better to go around 400 pm when the tours have left. Even if you go at the time the tours are there, the cathedral is so big that in general they will not prevent you from enjoying it."

Massive pillars of marble all around.The inside is very nicely decorated with wonderful mosaics on walls and ceilings. The internal center of the dome has a silvery dove in the center, representing the holy spirit, I believe. Massive stained glass behind the altar that is very beautiful as well.There is a fee to enter this building and a separate fee that allows you to climb up to the colonade for a very nice view of the city up near the dome. Must be capable to climb 200+ steps up, no handicap access available."

They had a touch screen television that you could get additional information on some of the art work on the huge doors. I had never seen anything like that and found it very informative and interesting technology. During WWII the gold dome was painted over because it made a very visible target.

We used Ulko Tours while we were in St. Petersburg, and our guide, Mariana, knew all about the art work and the history of St. Isaac's. I'm so glad she gave us the option of going inside. I loved the mosaics. They were stunning and looked as if they were paintings. The stained glass was also wonderful. \"St. Isaac's is the fourth largest domed cathedral of its type in the world after St. Peter's in Rome, St. Paul's in London and Santa Maria dei Fiori in Florence.\" I had been iside the other three cathedrals and was glad to check St. Isaac's off my list."

There is an entry fee in to the 'museum' which in reality is the entire ground floor of the church. Inside you'll find some stunning ceiling paintings and art but also a strange mismatch of souvenir stall selling religious tat and temporary exhibitions. Worth a visit for the ceilings alone but does get quite busy (we went 11am). You can pay separately to go up to the viewing platform outside for views over the city."

All the architectural details are amazing, and everything kind of glows in the dim lighting. The light rays coming in from the center dome was pretty great too. Make sure you go up to the top while you are there. It does suck a little that they charge extra for visiting the roof area but it's worth it. You'll get a 360 view of St. Petersburg with the main canal and the Hermitage on one side and other churches and cathedrals as well as residential areas on the other side. There's no elevator and you'll have to climb 262 steps to the top. But they are shallow steps so it's not too bad. It won't take too long to see the cathedral and go up to the top, so it's definitely worth a visit even if you do not have a lot of time in St. Petersburg.note: there were still constructions when I went, but it wasn't too bad or distracting at all."

I didn't say which is the most beautiful church of all,because Europe hasseveral top-beauty of the baroque churches : Gesu (Jesus),St Ignace of Loyola,Santa Maria Maggiore,San Giovanni in Laterano (papal residence,prior to the Vatican) - all of them in Rome (Italy) - or the church of Melk monastery (Austria). The most beautiful interior of churches is in Baroque style and the most beautiful church exterior in the world belongs to the Dome of Florence (Italy). I visited all the churches above,I've got photos and albums about them,so that I can make a comparison in this matter.If I am to compare St Isaak Cathedral with another one,I would compare it only withSt Paul's Basilica in Vatican,where dominate the Carrara white marble and the gildeddecorations,including the dome; we can add here colored marbles (green,black,brown,red) of the pavement and of some sumptuous tombs of pops,as well as Bernini'ssplendid canopy placed above the grave site of St Peter. Overall,a breathtaking beauty !I don't say which cathedral is the most beautiful.I only say that St Isaak Cathedral in St Petersburg (Russia) is the most LUXURIOUSBaroque church in the world,because it has not only marbles (white and colored) andgold, but also semi-precious stones (malachite,lazurite) ,superb stained glass windowsand superb gold plated statues. BREATHTAKING, by BEAUTY and LUXURY !This is what I saw and felt in St Isaak Cathedral, St Petersburg. I join several photos taken in place,so everyone can judge for himself.Too bad it was too dark inside the church and the splendors were not emphasized asthey fully deserve !"

It's nearly impossible to actually view it from up close (and it is hemmed in on three sides by roads and buildings) and even crossing to the small park to try to get a photo only emphasizes the size of this absolutely enormous church. The huge porticos with heavy columns are impressive, and give the church a very heavy, solid look. No soaring gables here, no light-as-air windows. This feels more like a huge mausoleum plopped down into the center of town, topped by a gleaming gold dome that is visible above the surrounding buildings.Tickets to go inside to view the church (and the various exhibits inside, it is more museum than church) and to climb up the colonnade for views out over the city are sold separately. It is definitely worth the haul up the 265 stairs to the gallery around the colonnade (I was disappointed that you don't actually get to go up the final spiral staircase to the very top of the dome, but that's not permitted), with great views over the city, especially on a sunny day. Nearly every other landmark is visible. The spiral staircase is quite wide and easy to maneuver for most of the way, then narrows down as you reach the last few turns (with a good railing). The last bit of the climb is an external straight stair up to the colonnade, quite a relief from all the circling. There are two staircases, one for up and one for down, so you aren't trying to pass anyone on the stairs. There is no time limit on climbing up, or just sitting up on the colonnade to enjoy the view.Inside, the decorated dome and arches are beautiful, and the sheer size of the place is a bit more obvious. There are various displays of icons nad paintings, and models of the domes and church to peer at, but most of the time is spent staring up at the ornate walls and dome. It's quite different from the shining interior of Church on the Spilled Blood, or the inside of the Kazan Cathedral, but it is impressive to look up into the huge dome and soaring arches, and to see the hugely thick doors (almost like vault doors) leading in to the church. Not a huge amount of gold leaf in here.The colonnade and church are open quite late (even later in summer), but the ticket kiosk moves to the other side of the building, so you have walk around to get in. Easy, but our first visit, we didn't realize that the church was still open, since we didn't see the location of the \"night\" ticket window.Climb up for the view, but don't miss seeing the inside of this enormous building, either. Perhaps it's not the \"traditional\" church interior, but don't miss it."

So plan accordingly, if your interested in going inside. This is one of the largest buildings in St. Petersburg, and that's saying a lot. Its huge golden dome and massive structure not only makes a great reference point, but the grand scale and historical significance of this church makes for an interesting visit. Due to us going on the day the inside was closed, we could only go up to its observation colonnade, which in itself was worth the price (80R if I remember correctly). The commanding view of the city from this point really gives you an appreciation for how big St. Petersburg is, not to mention a view of other distant sites and the river Neva. We went on a day that was quite warm, so the breeze up there was also very refreshing. Note: The stairwell leading up to the observation colonnade is long, somewhat narrow, winding and at times poorly lit so use good judgement if planning to go up. The good part was when we went, the inner stairwell was still very cool inside."

The pendulum of Fuko, which had been here since 1930ies, a period of antireligious strife, till 1989. it was a popular trick: a pendulum with a very long thread (almost 100 m) due to influence of the earth rotation changes visibly direction of swinging. I remember my astonishment some 45 years ago. Then, looking ironically, in 1989 they have decided to abolish this proof of the rotation (either thinking that it is obvious - or abolishing rotation in general) with the original silver dove, the symbol of the Holy Ghost. Here we can also remember about another ghost, Marx's Ghost of Communism from his famous manifesto. Then, probably that pendulum was an embodiement of the Ghost of communism?One recent addition reminds about the New testament episode with Christ driving moneylenders out of the Temple. Nowadays they have managed to make their way back to St.Isaac's: by the exit you will find an ITM machine..."

            "review": "Don't miss it if you come to St Petersburg. St Isaac 's is definitely one of the must-see sights in St Petersburg. You might think that you've been to so many cathedrals in different countries that you can do very well without another one , but that ' s where you are wrong . Outside, it might be as impressive as some other big cathedrals , but inside, it beats a good many of them.The cathedral used to be Russia ' s major Orthodox church in the 19th century. The interior walls are faced with 14 kinds of different- colored marble and decorated with numerous paintings, murals , and mosaics by Russia ' s eminent 19th -century artists. The iconostasis with golden mosaic icons and huge columns of bright- green malachite and bright -blue lapis lazuly is really stunning , so make sure you bring your camera to take some gorgeous pictures of the inside.The booking -office is right next to the entrance : An adult ticket is 320 rubles (about USD 10) and no credit cards accepted - it has to be cash, and Russian rubles only. To take pictures of the inside , you have to book a camera permit inside the cathedral (50 rubles - about USD 1.70) .Besides seeing the inside, you can climb up to the observation platform at the top of the colonnade to get the best panoramic view of St Petersburg and its main river , the Neva. You will need to book a separate ticket to go up (worth 100 rubles - about USD 3), but think twice before you decide to do it: There is no elevator , which means you will have to spend quite a while climbing up the 300 steps of the spiral stairway inside the thick wall. If you have done this in St Paul ' s in London, then you have a pretty good idea of what the climb in St Isaac 's is like. When you do get to the top , however , you are rewarded with a magnificent view of the city 's historical center."

            "review": "Awesome _ Inside, Outside and on Top...!!. St Isaac's is located on a prominent square rubbing shoulders with the Astoria (which sports a menu handwritten and ordered by the Fuhrer to commomerate capture of St Petersburg, an event which never happened) and Blue Bridge (the widest of the hundreds of bridges in St Petersburg). The tall dark granite columns and the magnificent dome of this almost 200 yrs old, and the largest of St Petersburg's cathedrals, are reminiscent of St Paul's, London and St Peter's Basilica, Vatican and are no less impressive. The huge bronze doors hide an awe inspiring interior - the insides host a wealth of Orthodox Russian Icons, murals and paintings, the sight of which more than compensates for the large entrance fee. The icon of Tikhvin is especially considered as healing and wonder-working. A suspended dove is seen from inside below the dome and is said to depict the Holy Spirit. A visit to this museum complex isnt complete without climbing up onto the top of the collanades - this offers an all round view of the great city from almost 100 metres height. This square is perhaps the only one in this city to have been spared the Nazi bombing and what you see is very much the original from the outside."

Now it has been restored to being a church, but without worshippers, so is called a museum. At the ticket office we were a little confused between \"museum\" and \"collonade\" if you want to go in the church its the museum price and the collonade is to go up to the dome fore view. We didn't do the collonade, but we did go inside the church and it was pretty spectacular. It has lapis lazuli and malachite columns at one end with plenty of mosaics as well. There are displays on the changes to the church since it was built, which are interesting to look at as well. It was well worth the visit!"
