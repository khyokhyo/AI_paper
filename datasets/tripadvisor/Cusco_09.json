The guide books say it is open until 5:30 but the guards won't let anyone in after 4:30 pm. They can't leave until the last person gets out so they are not thrilled to let you in late. The drive up was worth it with fantastic views."

Reportedly the Incas studied how different seeds and plants might optimally grow in different soils which were imported. Native farmers still beneficially grow products in the imported terrace soils around the country."

I took a tipon bound bus from the avenida de la cultura stop, across from the hospital. I asked the bus driver to let me know when we were at my stop and he did. Then once I arrived (1 hour, 2 soles), I took a taxi to the ruins for 8 soles (they will try and get you to pay 12). I read in my Lonely Planet book that you could walk to the ruins, but the road was really windy and steep with buses flying up and down it so I took a taxi instead. The ruins themselves were really cool with an aqueduct system and big terraces. The view from the top is also breathtaking. Then I took a taxi back down to the bus stop (I just waited for one to come up and drop someone else off and then took it back down to tipon)."

However, we still managed to see plenty! The site is very well maintained and the water still runs through the ancient channels! Take your time on this one - we spent about 40 minutes here but would have needed probably double that (or more) to be able to see all of it! The site is spread out over quite a large area with amazing views no matter where you are! We read up on the site before our visit and found it sufficient, otherwise I would recommend a guide as there is no information or signage. There are toilets at the entrance (not the cleanest, no toilet paper and a hole in the door where the lock should be, so anyone can see inside)! Wear sunscreen and a hat as you\u2019re exposed to the sun the entire time. Entry is by Boleto Turistico."

We were glad to have taken the taxi vs a tour because it allowed us to take the time where we wanted. We did spend a few hours walking the Tipon area. The sophistication of the aqueduct system they built there was interesting to us, and therefore worth the visit. On this same day, we went to see Pikillacta which we found very interesting- an old large Huari city. It was very different than the Inca structures, so we enjoyed exploring it. In this area, the Rumicolca passageway is very close, so we stopped there as well. It is just once gateway, but interesting in structure with an aqueduct running along the top of this very tall structure. Although we went to the churches in Andahuaylillas and in and in Huaro, and they were impressive with their murals, they were just not our kind of thing. What we were successful in finding in Huaro, right on the same square where the church is is a museum of sacred stones. This is a relatively new museum housed in what seemed to be the same building with the village offices, but it was quite interesting to me, to see some of the stonework used in the aqueducts, but more than that a stone 'music table' that was very unique- where you they used a stone tapped on different places on the rock slab to make different tones... They also had stones with carvings, and petroglyphs there, pipes, and an authentic mummy. Kind of diverse collection of things, but many that we'd not seen in other museums, so we were glad we found it. (The taxi driver was not familiar with it, so we had to persist in the fact it was there in the village. The taxi driver was quite interested in the items in the musuem, so I think he was glad we persisted too!)."

We booked a taxi tour through Taxidatum of Peru for Southern Valley tour. It took us about 40 minutes from our hotel to reach the site in the morning (including some rush hour traffic). It is way up in the mountain. The artificially created terraces are big and the irrigation system flows on both sides of each terrace. The amazing thing is that both the open channel and the underground ducts are still functioning after at least 500 years or more. Amazing Inka (or Wari?) ingenuity. In my opinion, this is a must see site if you come to Cusco. The entrance fee is covered by the Boleto Touristico."

(Bring Snacks if you don't like street food)We started by taking the city bus to the city of Tipon. It took around 45min and cost 4 soles. These are the buses that are racing through the city of Cusco and it'll have the name Tipon and other destinations printed on the bus. You arrive in Tipon on the highway and it's a very small town. There are always taxis waiting to pick people up and we arranged a round trip deal. If you don't do this they might up the prices for the trip back. When we arrived at the ruin site we used our Boleto Turistica del Cusco ( Ticket for Tourists in Cusco, it lets you into many sites and is quite cheap ) and entered the site. We never do tours because they tend to rush you and we like to set our own pace. The main site is amazing and easy to navigate. The real treasure here is on the left side when you enter. You can find older paths that lead up the mountain and ancient road that goes quite high up. We did this whole extra hike and loved it. I've heard that tours discourage this route. After we explored everything we took our taxi back to the town of Tipon and wait for the bus that took us back to Cusco. Great day and a great way to see some ruins for cheap. :)"

We found this site interesting for 3 reasons, first was the amount of water flowing at the site, although not all the fountains are still operating, there is still a lot of water flowing here. The second reason is that there is a section of Inca trail above the site with an aqueduct in the middle and it still has water flowing in it. The third reason is that aside from locals having pick-nicks, the site was almost empty, I think we only saw 6 or 8 other tourists while there."

To the right are small ruins and the trail to the left takes you up to more ruins and even more spectacular views.

The day I was there, with a dedicated guide, there was one smallish tour group - and a lot of local Cusco families.Tipon consists of a series of very-carefully-laid out terraces, with a single watering source, characterized by its magnificent four-spout fountain. This fountain feeds water into the hight terrace, and from there channels and engineered water-falls feed the water to the lower terraces.An overlooking ridge sports a \"high place\" placed strategically to overlook both the valley below and the terraces. And more than one ancient Inca road-way connects this site to others nearby.[This site is part of the full-fare Boleto Turistico for Cusco and Sacred Valley ruins.]"

We went straight to the ruins of Tipon and got a guide- this was the only ruins we visited where the guide told us that payment was voluntary. The ruins are not as extensive as some of the others we visited, but there is more water. I guess if you like ruins you will like these. I did. We did run into a couple who must have walked up or had their taxi leave and they were stranded up there. Sadly, no room in our taxi for them- so be aware to know how you are getting back into town. Our guide said the best place in the town of Tipon for 'cuy', or guinea pig, was El Rancho. That is where we ate. It was succulent, tender, the skin was crisp and fatty. If you have had rabbit, it is similar. It had been stuffed with some herbs that looked vaguely like yarrow. Between the two of us we could not finish one cuy. I think it was 35 soles, or about 12USD. We heard in Cusco that if you are in Tipon, any restaurant will have good cuy, and we saw the little domed ovens all along the road. I thought it was worth the trip- but I always taste the local food. We were back in San Blas before 1pm."

It's not very popular among tourists, we arrived there in the afternoon on our first day in Cusco, and there were 3-4 dozen people there who mostly left by the time we were leaving. This is a definite plus. The site is thought to be a park for the Inca elite and the wide terraces support this notion as they are unusually wide to compare with agricultural terraces of Pisac or Machu Picchu. But the main attraction here are the fountains with water supplied thru the elaborate irrigation system of above- and underground canals. You can climb up to the fortress ruins (signs for Pukara) and from there hike up the Inca canal, the main water artery. It's a multi-tier aqueduct going up the hill where remains of some Inca structure are located. A hike there may take 1-1.5 hours in my estimate. I regret we didn't do that since in addition to seeing the source of water and getting a great view from the top it would be a nice way to acclimatize ourselves to the altitude of Cusco. I should have read a bit more on the subject before arrival. Anyway, we walked up 5 sections of the aqueduct up to the alternative water source running underground from a nearby hill. The main spring at the top is probably dry and the upper portion of the canal is not functional at this time. Along the canal there is a small ritual plaza with nice stonework. Going back to the fortress will lead you down to the temple with a small fountain. It took us about 2-2.5 hours to do the site, but with the hike up the hill you can spend the entire day there. We hired a taxi from Cusco and went to Piquillacta and Rumicolca after visiting Tipon. Excellent site. Included in the Boleto Turistico."

As a result your are often the only ones there and it retains a very peaceful and spiritual character that puts you in touch with history. The heart of Tipon is the flow of water through its aqueducts and the terracing that falls dramatically down the site. The views are spectacular and if you make the effort to hike up the trail to your left as you walk into the site you will end up with a dramatic view across the Andes, especially at dusk as the sun sets. If you follow the aqueduct up into the hills you will be amazed at how far it goes and the peacefulness that you find. Apparently it is a two hour hike to the upper ruins and the source of the water. I have been there twice with groups of students and we have had a local shaman or holy man who has done a blessing ceremony. It is quite moving in this setting."

Of course I would recommend everyone seeing Machu Picchu and the Sacred Valley, but Tipon and the South Valley are a must. A lot of tourist agencies in the heart of the city offer tours to the South Valley for about 60 soles, not including entrance fees. You could get a taxi too, and if you do you should catch it on Pavitos street, just a few blocks away from the Avenida el sol. The Tipon ruins are the most peaceful and include a beautiful view looking down. If you go on any of the tours though you may not have enough time to enjoy the regional delicacy of cui, or guinea pig. If you do have time, you will notice in the main part of the town numerous cuyerias or restaurants that serve them. Tipon is known for its guinea pig, and it beats anything you'd find in the city of Cusco proper where they serve you a slice and charge you a huge chunk of change. In Tipon, they serve the whole thing, stuffed with herbs, and alongside other sides, generally potatoes. It looks small, but it's filling, more so when the altitude cuts back your appetite. If you are really serious about trying cui, this is a place where you can't go wrong. Sometimes there are people outside waiting to greet and convince you to go to their family's restaurant. If this happens to you...I say you should go for it. It means they got their stuff up and running, and you'll be getting your cui quickly. If you have people with you who don't want guinea pig, then there might be other meat options available too, like the Cuscenian style chicharrones, not pork rinds but fried pork bits."

Our guide suggested to explore the ancient aqueducts on the top and from there to enjoy a lovely walking following one of the inca trails. The view of the archeological site is wonderful and after the first hike and getting to the fountains where we put our feet in the cold water renew us at the level to have the courage to walk down to the valley by the inca trail. We recommend to take your day for this and to bring some fruits and enough water due that there is nothing around. Our van was not expensive and for the four of us we payed $ 40 from Cusco. We loved the place and would like to explore the mountain in the top and as good hikers, we will return soon to Peru to visit other areas."

            "review": "Surprisingly nice. This was not on our original plan, but a guide at another site recommended it and we had time, so we added it on, and it was truly lovely. Not many people there, and no guides, either. The site is an homage to water, so has channels and fountains and was quite pretty. We climbed to the top, which had surprise interesting ruins and an unbelievable view.We hired a taxi for the day and had him drive us around the Sacred Valley; as the buses all follow the same schedule, this meant we were able to go to sites when the buses weren't there. It was awesome to be able to do this (we had many sites practically to ourselves), we spent as much or as little time as we wanted at each place, and had no \"forced\" shopping experiences that others told us about. Highly recommend this approach (it cost more than bus tickets, but I'm sure we saved money in the markets!!!). The taxi was also able to drop us off at one end of a site and pick us up at another spot, so we didn't have to backtrack."

The place is not full of tourists and very well conserved. At Tipon you will see some of the famous \"terrazas agricolas\", place where the Inca people used to plant and cultivate many different foods."

They were all interesting and not many tourists. The road up to Tipon was under construction so they only let you go up during the lunch hour and you have to head back down by 1 PM or you have to stay up there till 4PM. We were only at the site for 45 minutes which was rushing it but glad we made the effort. The irrigation engineering was amazing and the site is well preserved."

            "review": "Eat cuy, hike to Tipon. From Cusco I took a taxi to the bus terminal heading to urcos. Between s3 and s4. Bus to Tipon itself cost s2 and took 50 mins. Ask to be let off at the junction to the ruins.Walking along that road you'll come across at least two cuyeria that do roasted or deep fried guinea pig. It's so good! I had the cuy al horno or roasted version. For s30 I had a whole pig, noodles and four potatoes. The walk to the ruins is fairly straight forward. There are distance markings so just follow those. You should pass a rather sad looking zoo. That's the half way mark. Bring water. There's no store up there. The site itself is pretty massive if you're willing to walk the entire thing.Students bring your ISIC card. Like most national attractions you get a discount when you show it. Did I mention how amazing the view is from top?"

I\u2019d already been to a few Inca ruins including MP and the sites around Cusco and Ollantaytambo in the previous week and I didn\u2019t think there was anything unique at Tipon. However, I still enjoyed it \u2013 it was very peaceful and I spent about 2 hours walking round the site and taking photos.I travelled there independently from Cusco \u2013 caught a bus from Av de le Cultura to Tipon township and then a taxi up the hill to the ruins. There was a queue of taxis at the Tipon bus stop waiting for passengers to get off. I\u2018m glad I didn\u2019t attempt to walk up the hill \u2013 the 4 km road is quite steep and it rises to 3400 metres. I walked back down; taxis passed me on the way but I didn\u2019t mind the downhill walk.Entry to this site is included on the Boleto Turistico, or you can pay an entry fee (S/. 10) when you get there.If you wanted to see more ruins and had the energy you could catch another bus from Tipon to Pikillacqta (further along on the same road)."
