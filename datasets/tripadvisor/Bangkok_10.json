The lion share of the tour is within the grounds of the temple, and for a good reason. the temple area is rich in Buddhist decorations, statues, and other small buildings. The emerald Buddha in the main building is very impressive. I do recommend the audio tour, as it provides a good historical perspective on the different elements of the temples. Sometimes it is a bit boring, but you can skip to the next section."

They are not so touristy savvy like the Americans in marketing their places of interest. Even trying to get decent fridge magnets was not possible.The entrance fees for both the Grand Palace (250 bahts) and Emerald Buddha ( 250 bahts ) can be bought together.They are open from 8.20am-12 pm then  from 1pm-3.30pm.It is better to go early and make it the first port of call since the crowd builds up afterwards. The so called Emerald Buddha is actually made of jade and no one is allowed to take pictures or videos inside.Dress code is strictly adhered - no shorts or sleeveless clothing and hats or sandals/slippers when entering.The king is the only one who can dress up the Emerald Buddha during occasions.The various gifts given to the King by visiting dignitaries are also displayed in this place.A must see place whilst visiting Bangkok."

The Temple of the Emerald Buddah is within the grounds of the Grand Palace and is so beautiful, this was the first place I visited while at the Grand Palace.You must remove your shoes and place them on a rack before entering. There were so many people in the temple that you could barely move, but it was worth it, Phra Kaew was stunning to see, even though he was quite small, the temple in which he is housed is huge. You cannot take photos inside the temple but I was told it is ok to take photos from the outside if you have a camera with a good zoom, so I tried and the photos are not that great but at least you can see him.Even though I am not religious I felt overwhelmed, it really was amazing to see.Make sure you show respect and dress appropriately with your shoulders and knees covered."

            "review": "Stunning complex of temples, although hot and busy. This temple is part of the Grand Palace complex, and like most temples in this part of the world is an assortment of different structures. The main 'Wat' houses the Emerald Buddha - surprisingly small, but high up and well lit, and with a lovely deep green colour. The rest of the complex has lots to see - golden chedis (tapering towers), jewelled temples, roofs with curled gables, statues of demons and mythical creatures, and even a scale model of Angkor Wat. It is a very busy place so don't expect to have it alone, even if you're there in low season. Getting there early might help (I didn't, so can't say for sure). The crowds were generally good natured, but even so a big press of people all trying to photograph each other in front of the same monuments, in high heat and humidity, is never the nicest thing. Take patience, a sense of humour, and a water bottle and try to give yourself plenty of time so you can relax.It is a religious site so you need to dress modestly (this is enforced) and remove your shoes before going up to the Wat itself. It's fine to take photographs apart from inside the temple with the emerald Buddha itself, although you can take a picture from outside. Many Buddhists consider 'selfies' with Buddha images to be disrespectful, therefore I avoid taking them (although you'll see plenty of people who do)."

It houses the tiny (between 60 and 75 cm) Emerald Buddha, which is located high above the heads of the worshippers and tourists. Not much is known for certain about the statue, except that it isn't actually made of emerald but rather of green jade or jasper. The 'robe' that it wears is changed 3 times each year by the King himself, at the start of each season: A diamond encrusted gold robe during the hot season, a solid gold robe in the cool season and a gilded monk's robe in the rainy season.There are also many other Buddha images inside the temple. Round the interior walls are murals depicting the jataka stories. These are located according to the typical Thai conventions inside temples. The ones facing the altar depict the victory of the Buddha over the evil demon Mara, as he subdues her and achieves enlightenment. As is normal for Thai temples, shoes must be taken off before entering into the temple."

This temple is very different from the temples in Indonesia. Temples in Indonesia was made of stone structure, while the Temple of the Emerald Buddha (Wat Phra Kaew) was made of ornaments such as coating metals such as gold and colorful glass. It was look so beautifull. When you enter Temple of the Emerald Buddha (Wat Phra Kaew), you can simultaneously enter the Grand Palace sights thereafter. Foreign travelers only need to pay a ticket for 250 bath (in 2014) or almost equivalent to 100,000 IDR (Indonesian Rupiah). while for domestic tourists do not need to pay the ticket. We were lucky to get in for free because my husband was studying at a university in Bangkok, and our faces to look like the people of southern Thailand.I'ts amazing, beautifull, and unforgottable..I highly recommend you to visit this temple if you come to Bangkok, Thailand."

He wouldn't return the camera for about 15 minutes.Snapping a quick photo for you may seem okay, but it is not okay for Thai people. Don't risk it!

Entering the main hall, one has to take off shoes and hats (as any shrine would have make you) and no photography is allowed inside the area where the emerald Buddha is located. You must also be properly dressed to be allowed to enter.It is so small from our view because it was hoisted and I learned that only the King of Thailand is the only one allowed to go near it.Upon paying the 500baht ticket when going inside the Grand Palace, you will be guided to this temple next.

Emerald Buddha) + B/Reclining Buddha + C/Temple of Dawn ~ because they're near each other geographically. But need to start out early because of traffic, time to que, and early closing hours. Grand Palace closes at 3:30 pm and should spend the most time there among the 3 places. The other 2 places close at 6:30 pm.By geography, you should visit B, then A, then C.However, by closing time, you should do A, B, C or A,C,B. But you will have difficulty with transportation because traveling by boat or by car is restricted to one-way traffic. Also, these 3 places are in a triangular location on the map so any sequence / route planning is difficult in itself.4) beware of dishonest taxi and tuk tuk drivers. Taxi might not be willing to use meter. Need to negotiate fixed amount. Consider walking to avoid the hassle.5) Bring lots of water.6) beware of dress code. If you don't want to rent clothes, can buy new ones from street vendors nearby 7) buy tickets from official box office, not street vendors8) if take boat, there's tourist boat (40 baht per pax) and normal boat (14 baht per pax). Both offer similar service. Don't get tricked to take private boat, can cost up to 1500 baht per boat"

As soon as the doors open. The light will also be much more flattering for any photos and you will not suffer the heat as much. Please wear respectful clothing inside the temples and speak quietly. Covered knees and elbows are custom for both men and women. Preferably long sleeves and pants or skirt /sarong but as long as you wear shorts covering knees, a t-shirt will do as long as you wear a scarf over your upper body. Also do not sit in front of a statue or monk with the palms of the feet facing them. It's considered an insult and poor manors. Otherwise feel free to walk around. Talk to the monks. They like to talk! Remember though Always greet them with palms together as in prayer with the thumbs in front of your nose and make a slight bow. Then talk away and ask any question! :-)"

Some important details:-Wear clothing that covers your shoulders AND goes well past your knees. Skip the leggings even if they cover your knees, I saw the staff tell 2 ladies in leggings to cover up. Cover ups are free of charge, not sure what this extra charge other people mentioned was about??-before you dive into the center to see the temple areas, take a walk on the edge of the entire perimeter (where the paintings are along a walk on your left hand side). There are some beautifully detailed paintings worth seeing here, plus less people up there. ha! -It was really hard to take photos of the beautiful architecture when there were hundreds of people trying to take the perfect selfie (I think some people actually dressed up in gold to match the temples for better selfies!!) in every nook and cranny of the area. Really, the selfie thing is out of control in general. Do we go to these historic sights REALLY just to post photos of ourselves on FB? This makes me feel disheartened.

This temple is adorned with lots of precious stones & gold. The bad thing is that you can't take pictures of the inside of the temple but you are allowed to take pics outside of it. Because if you try to be defiant if the guards catch you doing so they will confiscate your phone/device as I saw this happen to several visitors. Also make sure that you are appropriately dressed if you want to go inside of the temple, they follow strict Buddhist guidelines. So no shorts, tank tops, or skimpy revealing clothing; you won't be allowed in. Also they will ask you to remove your shoes before entering so make sure your feet are clean & well looking haha... One recommendation is that since this is a temple make sure that once you are inside that you are on your best behavior (especially kids), try not to talk & definitely do not be loud. Lots of tourists go in there thinking that it's just another building but do remember that it is a temple & there are monks & others in there worshipping their god. But overall you'll be so impressed on how beautiful this temple is & how clean & elaborate it is. This is definitely a must see when visiting Thailand."

We should definitely preface this by saying that we visited on a very hot and humid day, and as Canadians, we are not built for that kind of weather.We arrived around my midday and passed a security guard who was pointing out people who needed to cover up more. Since she didn't point out either my partner nor I, we joined the long line for security. There were a lot of people, many pushing, and most of the time we were in the scorching sun. Then we walked to buy our tickets (which was 500 bahts a person) and then tried to enter the temple.That's when a security guard pointed to my fiance's shorts, which covered his knees. \"Not allowed!\" So we had to go back to the front and line up to put down a fully refundable deposit for a pair of pants. This line up took about 15 minutes. As an aside, as a woman I had read that we are supposed to cover up shoulders and knees, which I did. The security guard never pointed me out, but when we went to borrow the pants, the people behind the desk said I should probably borrow something too. My pants are a capris-length and go lower than the skirts the staff women were wearing, so the temple would prefer women to wear over the knee skirts (or full pants).So... by the time we actually entered the temple, we had been in the sun for around 45 min. The temple grounds are very beautiful but expect a lot of people taking a lot of pictures holding a lot of umbrellas. Also, be prepared to take off your shoes and given the hot day, unfortunately a lot of temples smelled like feet. Apparently this temple is an important place for practising Buddhists and while the grounds were a sight that we don't regret seeing, we found that the Wat Pho suited our interests more.So overall, it's a beautiful temple but expect a lot of people and strict rules."

The emerald Buddha is inside of a seperate building on the top of the altar. You can't really go close to it but you can still see cllearly. As all the other temples, you have to dress properly (shoulders and knees covered) but in case you are not dressed like this you can rent pants or skirt at the location but the line is usually quite long so try to dress into your own clothes (maybe this is the only good use of the baggy elephant print pants). The area of the temple is quite big with lots of overdecorated sparkly buildings. The details are truly impressive. It's easy to get overwhelmed by all the details and sparkly decorations so take it easy and take a break if you can't take more or don't spend too much time with one building. You will still probably end up taking hundreds of photos. The way to the exit is quite tricky but just follow the singns for 5-10 minutes and you will be out while seeing even more temple buildings. The dress code is the most stricked here and this is also one of the most expensive temples. I am not sure but I think around 400 baht, but it worth it."

I visited Bangkok often and been here many times.It always crowded and pack with tourist and local.A good place to worship but some privacy and local cultures need to be respected.Dont talk loudly and no mini skirts. Dont use your selfie stick and grab all the attentions. Respect the culture even when taking a picture. Give those who are sincere in worshiping a chance. You will definitely have your chance to take picture."

Ticket prixe 500 Bhat that includes grand palace , emerlad budda and museum of queen jwelery. Every one must wear pant ( covering legs ) and tops qith covering shoulders.. no sleeve less.

Especially coming into the main entrance, so many tour groups and it is so hard to get pictures with many people crowding and jostling. As advised, we arrived early, but alas, everyone had the same idea and we were swept along the tide of people. There is almost no shade, so I would still advise to go early morning so it will be slightly cooler. Might be nice to have a guide if you have a big group of people just so you would have an idea what you are looking at, but mostly it is nice to wander around the structures and marvel at the opulence of this temple. It is a working temple. You cannot take pictures inside the temple where the emerald Buddha is housed, but you go in one door and exit on the other side. As with temples, knees and shoulders need to be covered and shoes are taken off. After a visit to the Buddha, just wander around and enjoy taking pictures. The emerald Buddha is place high up on a pedestal and you cannot really get close to it and appreciate that it is made of emerald. Might be tough with small children but bring plenty of water and bribe with coconut ice cream after."

However it doesn't have anything different to the rest of the buildings within the palace groundswhich are all magnificent.

The good natured mass propelled us into the temple and slowed only momentarily as we went through one door and out of the other.

It is where only Royals used to be allowed to worship. It was basically the King's private temple in the old days. A lot of history here. Admission fee includes a free audio guide. And also you can see the Royal Palace on the same premise. Very unique building that combines Western and Thai design. Worth the visit...."

Please also note if you are closer to Temple of Emerald Buddha the Tourism authority also have free guided tour for a minimum number of people where you could become a part, this tour is more limited to Emerald Buddha temple and they guide you around the vicinity. Overall a great experience. On a hot humid day you can struggle and keep water at disposal , water is available at outlets at twice the cost.Don't miss this as it is the one main attraction when in Bangkok."

Normal tickets are 500 baht per adult, a little less than $15 USD. It is definitely worth it. The area is very large and there is a lot to see! You will need a couple of hours to make it though everything. Make sure you have some water and use the restroom before you enter, as toilets become scarce. Remember to be respectful. You may not enter if you are not dressed properly. No exposed shoulders and no shorts. Wear shoes not flip-flops. There is a rental shop right outside where you can rent a wrap to cover up if you need to. Overall it was an amazing sight and an interesting look into the culture and beliefs in Thailand."

We didn't have exact change so had to go find a store that would accept larger bills as payment to get change. Then we had to wait in line all over again.

However, in recent years, it's been completely overrun by tourists.

Forget trying to see the Emerald Buddha; Wat Phra Kaew is so crowded that you can't even fit in. And so many of the tourists seem to have so little regard to the fact that this is a very holy site; they treat it like it's Disneyland, and it really pains me to see this.

But this must be the most crowded temple I have visited in Thailand. It is obviously not the temples fault, but the experience was somewhat affected by the massive crowd inside. And people should show more respect. I am not a buddhist, but I always do my best to respect places of worship in general. The staff did their best to keep people quiet, not taking pictures where not allowed, and stay off lawns. I don't know if there is a time when it is quieter, but would recommend to go there anyway."

The Buddha is fairly high up on lots of golden plinths and it is possible to get quite close to look at it. You are not allowed to take photos in the temple though.

Do your research and don't believe anyone who wants to tell you something different! The better their English the more likely they are to relieve you of your cash!! They pose as security men policemen even undercover cops anything to scam the innocent Westerner out if his or her holiday money..be warned!!!"

Lots of local architecture which was very pleasant to the eyes. The Temple of Emerald Buddha is the holiest of the temples and photography was prohibited inside the temple compound. The place was packed with people. Ticket price was 500 baht per person.P.S There is a dress code and bare legs or sleeveless clothes are not allowed.We did not take any guide or translator, didn't feel the need to do so. FYI we covered four temples in one day with ease:1) Wat Pho (The Temple of Reclining Buddha)2) Wat Traimitr (The temple of Golden Budhha)3) The Grand Palace & The Temple of the Emerald Buddha (Wat Pra Kaew)4) Wat Benchamabopith (The Marble Temple) - The The marble temple was the smallest and least picturesque though the Budhha Idol inside was equally mesmerizing. It can be skipped if you are time constraint.We paid 1500 Baht to the taxi driver who stayed with us for the whole day. You need not hire any tour guide to visit the temples, just a reliable taxi driver will do ( we were 4 adults and 2 children, so hired a Toyota Innova). We were free by 1600 hrs."

We was in a que for ages finally got to the front, there was a male office staff member arqueing with a customer about her ticket and she had a few kids with her. She was trying to be reasonable but he was very rude and alpha male. The staff in the office were rude and uninterested. Our clothing was then checked ( we were both fully covered as per the dress code) we were then told we had to rent more clothing at 100 baht a piece and go next door to put it on. The scene next door was a ruckus of people grabbing clothing. The extra clothing was going to cost a further 500 baht! At this point we walked feeling very pissed off and grumpy..

I was hoping to get an audio guide, but you can only rent one if you leave your PASSPORT or CREDIT CARD behind as a kind of insurance. Even a driving license is not accepted. It's a policy that is hard to understand. I find it high suspicious and cannot help but think that those documents are asked for only because there is something to be gained from it - that is, either an identity or money will be stolen. The horrible attitude of the lady at the window made me feel that that is exactly what is intended. The map provided was useless and there are no signs to tell you what you are looking at."

There are vendors that rent and sell temple attire. Maybe even recommend buying some of those thai pants as souvenirs. The entry fee is 500b for tourist. Cost is too high as this place gets tons of visitors everyday and where does the money go. However I do love the wall murals all along the temple and if you get a guide they can tell you about the stories behind the murals. This place is outdoors in the middle of the city so its really HOT!!! be prepared. I love taking the chao praya river cruise boats to this destination. Also a few cool riverside restaurants not to far away (The Deck is walking distance)."

Wat Pho (Reclining Buddha) and Wat Arun (Temple of Dawn) should be also be include in your day's journey of amazement. I have visited Wat Phra Kaew over 300+ times and have always found something new, something to see again, something to fell in its beauty. Your first time will give you a sense of awe. But during each visit, scam artists will tell you the Temple and Grand Palace are closed for an hour. They have at most times convinced my first time Thai residents friends, but believe me, it is not CLOSED. The scam artists want you to take another 1-2 hour not worth the time and expense. You will be doing a lot of walking all day and Wat Pho, were King Rama I built the temple for the Reclining Buddha, is also the school were Thai people obtain their Massage License. I would avoid getting a massage their and pay just $1-3 more at the many Massage Parlors close, but away from Central Bangkok. It will add to the days experience."

Later on a bit of stucco pealed off revealing a green color inside. The priest removed all the stucco and lo behold-the Emerald Buddha was revealed. It remeined in Chiang Mai for many years and then was removed to other places before finally being installed in the temple in the Grand Palace.Like most other Buddhist temples there is a dress code- no shorts or revealing clothes. Women rent a long shawl & men fisherman pants near the ticket counter. The Temple is located within the Grand Palace & is located on Na Phra Lan Road, Old City. It is open daily, tickets sold from 8:30 am to 3:30 pm."

Do prepared that it is an incredibly crowded place with a billion tourists. So be ready to deal with a crowd! Oh and this shouldn't be a surprise in Bangkok, but oh boy was it hot!

Photos don't do it justice, you need to see and experience it, you will not regret it and it is cheap to get in. I can think of more expensive attractions back home that are nowhere near the quality of this. It is very busy so you need to be patient if there is a particular photo you want to take without a forest of selfie sticks in the way but it is worth the effort. Take plenty of water with you as there aren't any shops inside the temple complex. If you are in or near Bangkok then go visit, it's a must."

But the highlight for me was going into the Temple of the Emerald Buddha. It was breath-taking. unfortunately we were not allowed to take photos but so much gold on so many pillars and then at the very top the Emerald Buddha sat. it was worth going round just to see that alone, so don't get disheartened if you are disillusioned by what you are allowed to see at the Palace, especially if you need to cover your shoulders and knees (pay a deposit to hire long items of clothing) but so glad to persevered to see what else there was to offer."

Spectacular and with plenty of photo opportunities, yes, including for the Emerald Buddha image itself (you can\u2019t take pictures in the hall, but shooting through the open windows seems acceptable), but once you get past the almost airport-type security and get your expensive ticket (currently 500 THB) it\u2019s wall-to-wall tourists and brusque staff policing them with a marked lack of Thai smiles.Go, take your pictures, tick it off on the list \u2013 but then get a tuk-tuk outside (declining any \u201cspecial offers\u201d) or just walk the block to Wat Pho, the Temple of the Reclining Buddha. Every bit as spectacular, but with an entrance charge of only 100 THB (and they give you a free bottle of water), and far fewer visitors."

You must wear long pants and a shirt with sleeves (short sleeves are fine) or you will have to rent clothes from a kiosk to the right of the entrance. A scarf around your shoulders is not sufficient, but you can wrap a sarong around your legs.Don't miss the silk shop located right next to the clothing rental area. It's not well marked so it's easy to miss. They sell all kinds of gorgeous things made of silk for actually very reasonable prices. If you go out of the clothing rental area, look right and you'll see glass doors. It's also extremely well air conditioned so not a bad place to catch your breath before leaving!Two tips: 1.) There are about 5 million massive Asian tour groups. They tend to move as a one, like schools of fish, so never assume you need to wait in line for something just because you see a huge group of people...they are probably all just standing there!2.) Beware of selfie sticks and umbrellas. Nearly lost an eye on several occasions."

No worries even if you didn't you can get a \"sarong\" to wrap yourself :)Actually, before we went, i always thought i will get to see a huge statue of Buddha Emerald, but its' was actually a standard statue placed inside a room, so we can only view from Far. It's interesting to know that if you go there during different season, you will actually see the change in costume for the Emerald. Hot season - a stepped, pointed headpiece; a breast pendant; a sash; a number of armlets, bracelets and other items of royal attire. All items are made of enameled gold and embedded with precious and semi-precious stones.Rainy season - a pointed headpiece of enameled gold studded with sapphires; a gold-embossed monk's robe draped over one shoulder.Cool season - a gold headpiece studded with diamonds; a jewel-fringed gold-mesh shawl draped over the rainy season attire."

Several Thai locals told us the temple was closed for a 'holiday', one said it was closed until 2 pm for 'lunch', another said it was closed till 1:30 pm for prayers. These are all LIES! They lie to keep you spending money on the outside of the complex. A man standing outside of the wall with a brown security shirt told us it was closed as well, locals BUY police/security uniforms to ward away the tourists. So rule of thumb; LISTEN TO NO ONE. SEE FOR YOURSELF, walk up to the entrance, ignore everyone, and see if it is closed with your own eyes. The Palace and Temple do not close! They hold the same times every day. Thanks for reading, and please click the 'Helpful' button so no other tourists get tricked like us! Also eat before you go, food is expensive around this area. And as a rule ALWAYS research a tour before you go on it, we were conned into spending 800 BHT per person for a \"boat tour\" that was nothing but driving up and down the canal. Don't spend too long in Bangkok, you only need a day, and then go somewhere nice like Chiang Mai (the people and city are wonderful there)!"

I got to know when I was at the gate to buy tickets, but I attempted to go the next day and enjoyed my visit."

The history was fascinating and I was expecting it to be well within sight of a camera shot. Unfortunately so were hundreds of other people. It is on-high and unless you are very tall, or have very sharp elbows it is difficult to see. Fortunately I had an official guide who was very determined for me to see and photograph, actually pushed the tourists aside for me to get through, I was a little embarrassed but really appreciated her brisk approach. Hope you have a better view than I, perhaps you should either go early in the morning or later in the day, do check opening and closing times before you go or you may be disappointed!"

The temple was a bit crowded, but it was totally worth seeing.  What I like about the Wat is that there are many paintings inside the Wat. You can see the stories of Thai legend that were told from century to century. When I visited, there was also a guide who would lead us from place to place. That made it easy for us because it allowed us to visit the important ones and the guide also gave great explanations about each place. For example, when we visited one of the Wat with lots of paintings, the guide explained what the paintings were about and what the stories told. I found these stories very interesting. I would recommend you to ask for a guide so that he or she could explain the architecture to you. What I disliked was that it was crowded, so you might find it a bit irritating walking around with many people blocking your way. Another thing was that it was very hot on the day I visited, so I was sweating all over. We had to occasionally hide in the shade before visiting each new section. The most important thing to remember when going there is that you should bring an umbrella because it gets very hot in the afternoon. Other than an umbrella, you might bring hats or sunglasses to protect you from the UV of the sun. I would also recommend you to apply on sunblock because the ray of the sun might cause you to have sunburn. Other than that, you should be able to enjoy the amazing architecture of Wat Phra Kaew."

The architectures outside and inside were indeed remarkable. The temple located inside the grand palace and entrance fee are included in the 500Bath grand palace ticket. Open everyday 8.30am to 4 pmbjt last entrance allowed was 3.30pm.Proper clothing should be use, no shoes, no hats, no sunglasses were allowed inside. Shoes should be placed at the shoes rack outside but they dont guarantee its safety. So if you travel in pair or groups, you can take turns going inside whilst the other guarding the shoes or you can bring your own shoe bag to carry it. Oh and no worries if you dont dress properly, at the main gate they rent you proper clothing and there were also changing rooms if you bring your own clothing for thia visit."

Got there by BTS and boat. Starting point (Central pier) of the Tourist boat is located at the exit 2 of the BTS Saphan Taksin Station. You can spend 40 Baht to get the Grand Palace and Wat Phra Kaew, or buy a one day pass (150 Baht ) to get multiple spots along the river.The temples were built in the Rattanakosin style, with a very elegant and splendid decoration. The roof is embellished with polished orange and green tiles and the pillars are inlaid in brilliant mosaic. Gorgeous temples!!There were so many tourists. Very crowded. Be noticed that the opening time is from 8:30 AM to 3:30 PM."

By far the most expensive temple Thai I visited, but at a cost of approximately $16 it was well worth the price of admission. This is a must see. It is very crowded and takes quite a long time to see the entire complex. I made a day of it by visiting Wat Pho and Wat Phra Kaew on the same day. Big mistake. Do yourself a favor and visit each temple complex separately, you will be glad you did. A lot of tourists combine both temples into a single trip because of their close proximity, but I will hold fast to the opinion that you will get more from your experience if you visit them separately.Also, be sure to visit the museum before you leave the grounds. Crowded, crowded, crowded. Prepare yourself mentally for a huge crowd and very long lines, and you will enjoy this delightful temple with all of its rich ornaments. Almost every inch of the exterior as well as the interior is adorned with shiny, sparkly, lavish, faux jewels of some kind. Simply Amazing. Allow yourself to get lost in the splendor.NOTE: There is no photography allowed inside the Temple of the Emerald Buddha. Please do not be the obnoxious person who gets caught taking photos. Trust me, it really distracts from the tremendous spiritual experience. Put your camera down and simply bask in the aura of the atmosphere. Great place for a quick meditation and or prayer. You will blend right in.This temple is stunning to say the least."

I will begin by saying that I have been to Japan twice and though this was our first time in Thailand, we had already visited many temples as part of our travels. From Tokyo to Nara, Kyoto, Phuket and Ayutthaya... we have been to a number of very famous temples and thus I feel travelled enough to pass comment on the temple. Unfortunately, maybe through no fault of its own, Wat Phra Kaew ranks towards the bottom!We visited here with our two boys (6 and 2) at the end of March and just found it VERY stressful to be honest. Firstly, it was just insanely busy and full of groups of Chinese tourists pushing and shoving. Secondly, one of the ladies who works there was very aggressive and rude to my wife in demanding she covered her shoulders. While we respect tradition and customs, the manner in which she was told was horrible. I know one person cannot be held accountable for the whole site, but it was still poor. What ensued was a LONG queue to pay a (returnable) deposit for appropriate robes and then another VERY LONG wait to receive our money back. The whole system wasted time (not good in the sweltering heat, especially with young kids) queueing like cattle for robes and people pushing in the queue etc. Many of the other temples in Thailand just have a box of clothes and operate on a basis of trust (i.e. you will return anything you borrow) so I am guessing that given the size and popularity of the place, it has been a victim of its own success. Nevertheless, the system needs reviewing. I estimate over an hour was spent (in total) queueing.The temple and grounds itself was impressive; lots of gold and flamboyance and perhaps on a quieter day, we might have been able to enjoy it, but on this occasion, especially considering it was the most expensive temple we have visited (some are just 50 - 100 BHT) it failed to deliver, sorry. I would therefore advise travellers to try and avoid the traffic and get there earlier (we went around 2pm) or maybe even later. Traveller tip 1 - see above (re: times of arrival)Traveller tip 2 - Wat Pho (5-10 mins walk) is close to Phra Kaew and I found this to be more enjoyable.Traveller tip 3 - be careful outside and avoid the con-artists. We were approached within seconds of getting out of our taxi by a \"friendly\" localler wanting to know where we were visiting. When we told him, he told us that it was closed. I assume he wanted to take us to buy jewels or a tailored suit or something. Fortunately, I had been clued up beforehand but the more naive or trusting of travellers might have fallen victim to it."

They actually dress the emerald Buddha in 3 different sets of gold clothing which is changed for each of Thailand's 3 seasons (i.e summer, rainy, and cool). The actual emerald Buddha statue was a lot smaller than I anticipated though. Also, our guide indicated that emerald is just the color, it is actually made from a jade or jasper material. The temple is a large compound beside the Grand Palace. The temple is well maintained/preserved with other interesting architecture features and statues. Another feature that they have is a miniature model of the famous Cambodian temple complex Angkor Wat. Since I had actually been to Angkor Wat, the model was not all that impressive to me. My ticket was for both the Grand Palace and Wat Pra Keaw; so combing the 2 attractions, this has to be one of the top attractions in Bangkok. Maybe even the top one."

Open sandals were ok but must cover shoulders and have at least three quarter length trousers on. When visiting the Emerald Buddha, all shoes must be removed. The buddha is up quite high and fascinating to hear that his 'clothes' are changed season to season, and that it is the King himself who does the change (or his son if his health does not allow it!) Details from a tour guide (and MANY more) which we would've been unaware of if we'd visited alone! Thoroughly enjoyed this visit, would highly recommend as part of any Bangkok itinerary! "

It's an amazing visit and so beautiful, you mustn't miss out on visiting if you are in Bangkok. One issue we had was how many thousands of tourists were there when we visited. It can get a bit overwhelming trying to deal with the crowds to really enjoy the experience. We asked our hotel concierge who suggested if we make another visit we aim to be there for the very first two or last two hours of the day to get away from the crowds, and to have a little less heat to deal with. Nonetheless, it was a wonderful experience and so very beautiful. Make sure you're clear on what to wear when you go - it's easy to find out, but we saw so many people turning up in sleeveless T-shirts or shorts that needed to cover up. Worth knowing is that for a deposit, before entering you can use a locker and change from your shorts into long trousers which will be lent to you."

The most exciting part of your experience will be getting close to one of the standing fans to get a cool breeze and break from the heat. It also does help alleviate the smell of the hundreds of shoe tourists who have been walking on those stinky feet all day. It may sound harsh, and it's nothing I've seen in any of the reviews but I'm going to tell you honestly that the most overwhelming thing about the temple of the Emerald is the stench of sweaty toes.

I just to Bangkok March 12-20, 2016.Wat Phra Kaew is the most important Thai temple. It is located in the Grand Palace Complex BUT these are in fact different things. The main temple grounds are IN the Grand Palace compound. So there is more to see, if visiting the Grand Palace, than just the temples.This temple has so many buildings within it. We did a tour which was well worth it because we got to see everything important. We spent most of our tour time here (1.5 hours out of the 4 hour tour) because that's how much time you need to see everything. So many temples within this temple and such beauty! This is a must! While there are hundreds of temples in Bangkok alone, we visited the top 5 and this is definitely on the top of the list.Time: We did the tour in 1.5 hours because we had a guide. But if you are on your own, I'd say you could do this tour in 1 hour.Tip for ALL Thai Temples (some may be different but generally all are the same). I did my research before, knowing how religious Thai people are. Clothing: I cannot emphasize how important clothing is for all temples. You WILL be turned away for inappropriate clothing. They have a strict code for both men and women but I think it is best for everyone to stay covered. -No shoulders showing (absolutely no tank tops for men or women)-Nothing above the knee (I wore athletic pants and a t-shirt for all my tours and had no problems. Some websites prohibit athletic wear but I just went 2 weeks ago and found that that material doesn't matter at all because they are only looking for coverage. I think for women maxis are the best way to go, making sure your shoulders are covered! Shoes or sandals are fine to wear. They will tell you when you must take off your footwear)Do not touch anything. Everything in the temples is obviously old and historic and hand done. Also, do not try and mimic what the locals are doing. To you, this is an attraction, but to them, it could be their main place of worship. Be mindful of that and don't follow what they do since they will take offense to someone who isn't Buddhist or Hindu following their actions.They will tell you when photos are acceptable. This temple didn't prohibit photos anywhere, but there will be signs posted. They aren't kidding around. We witnessed a security guard taking someone's phone and deleting photos.I also read that it is considered disrespectful to turn your back to any statue of Buddha. Thai people will definitely appreciate if you follow rule.At the end of the day, these temples are sightseeing attractions to us. Look around and appreciate the detail. There is so much to see. If you are on a tour, your guide will take you to everything you need to see so don't worry. If you are not on a tour, go at your own pace, but remember that if you rush through everything assuming it's the same, you will definitely miss some stuff."

Monastics are given extreme respect and are treated almost like gods in most of Bangkok. Any perceived disrespect is not tolerated by the public, let alone by the police!Also, ensure you dress modestly, no knees showing, no sleeveless tops, not even if covered by a shawl or scarf. "

This was my third visit over the past twenty years, and I am sad to say this time was quite unpleasant due to the huge crowds of Chinese tourists. To understand how crowded it was, try to picture being shoulder-to-shoulder with a moving mob and being pushed from all sides. I was appalled at their rudeness...We arrived at about 9am in an attempt to beat the mid-day heat and the crowds. As mentioned above, we certainly did not miss the crowds. By the time we left at 11am, the crowds at the entrance seemed to decrease a little. It may be better to arrive late morning or afternoon. Personally, I would rather deal with the mid-day, Bangkok sun than thousands of pushy tourists.Please read about the dress code before you go! You must wear long pants and your shirt must cover your shoulders. Woman can wear a sarong as a skirt over shorts, so that you don't have to wear long pants during the rest of your day. My wife and her friend both wore sarongs. However, I saw several men (including my friend) refused entry for wearing a sarong over shorts. The guard said that a sarong is womens' clothes, and men must wear long pants. The dress code was definitely enforced more strictly than in the past... In general, I would recommend that everyone obey the dress code as you are visiting Temple that is of great importance to the Thais, so you should be respectful of their culture.Unfortunately, there is a lot of corruption in Thailand. I recommend that you read about the various scams before your visit. There are many scams that are repeated over-and-over, but are easily avoided. A typical scam at Wat Phra Kaew is for someone to approach you as you are just outside and tell you that it is currently closed. When this happened to me a few years ago, the scammer offered to take us on a tour over various sites in Bangkok (of course, for a fee), and then he would bring us back to the Wat in the afternoon when it \"opens\". I was suspicious, so I told him that I would just walk inside to check on the opening hours myself. It was open! I later learned that this is a very typical scam. Ignore them! Just keep walking!In general, if you are in a tourist area and someone approaches you and starts asking where you are going or giving you suggestions, it is best to ignore them and just keep walking."

Take the reviews about arriving early seriously, because I think we accidentally hit peak group-tour-time and unfortunately the aggressive and gigantic clumps of people really took away from the serenity of the gorgeous surroundings. We did find a few quiet corners, and overall absolutely still worth it, but plan well! Ticket includes Grand Palace and a couple museums, and easy to get here by metro plus water bus. Quick tip - guards were really strict on dress code when we were there, some women with scarves covering tank-tops were turned away, no shorts for men, and leggings have to be covered by a skirt/scarf wrapped as a skirt. Footwear was more lax."

Worth a visit.The only downside are the crowds of tourists. I don't think you can avoid them. We went on a week day and it was still ridiculously busy. It's also not that cheap in terms of the entry fee, but you also get access to the Grand Palace."

Both men and women must wear long clothes, although men are allowed to wear t-shirts. Locals go in for free and foreigners pay around 500 baht (if I remember correctly). It us around 1hr 30 mins to 2 hours to go round the whole area, this included to stop a couple of times to pay our respects to the Buddha (foreigners don't have to do this, Thai ppl most likely will do it, but as my gf is thai I wanted to pay my respects too) The grounds also include a museum which displays elephant bones and architectural relics found under the temple, so there is a historical element to it too and also a caf\u00e9 where u can sit and have some refreshments.

We rented the audio guide - very informative and value for money as the guide to The Grand Palace Complex is included as well. Bring water. It is a long walk around the whole complex - almost two hours.What we didn't like:The 1000s of mainland Chinese tourists who were pushy, rude, disrespectful and obnoxious: Laud when the signs asked for 'Silence Please', took photos when the signs said 'No Photo', climbed barriers to touch and have their photos taken with statues when the signs said 'Do Not Climb/Do Not Touch'. Without the mainland Chinese tourists it would definitely have been a 5 star attraction - but only 3 stars after having been poked in the face by their umbrellas (sun), pushed in the back, and loudly yelled at for not moving quickly enough. Try to get there as early as possible - to avoid most of the busloads of Chinese tourists. And no, I am not xenophobic - I live in Hong Kong."

The enormous amount of tourists determined to see the Smaragd statue of Buddha might spoil your experience and you might also find statues of Buddha in adjacent temples are bigger and more adorable. The ticket costs 500 baht and can be bought once you are in the complex.While there try to catch the change of guards in front of the palace - we caught one at 12:00."

It was just a sea of people which in this degree of heat and humidity was exhausting! For me it isn't the tiny emerald buddah which is the highlight of this complex; it's the fabulous wall paintings depicting images of the Ramayana. Don't listen to touts who will tell you the temples are closed to drag you off to a\"sponsor\" - often a tailor or gem factory- the Palaces open every day and close only if there is a member of the Royal family visiting. Don't let the weather put you off either, I had one of my best visits when the wind blew through the chimes hanging around the eves, creating the most amazing atmosphere. Do try the express ferry from one of the piers, getting off at Tha Thian, but this option is a complete no go for those with nervous or very small children and older people with less mobility, as you need to be fleet of foot to get on and off the ferries quickly."

Make sure to take plenty of water as you will be doing a lot of walking around and Bangkok is known to be very hot.

If there are a lot of people on the day (and there usually is every day), this can take a lot of time, so be prepared and pack something extra to put on in your bag. Also, we found the ice cream stand after you exit is very very expensive! We paid more there than in Australia, and we won't be having ice cream there again. The day we went, there were a lot of Chinese tour groups who disobeyed the signs asking for silence, and were yelling out to their friends and family. Please respect the temple as it is a sacred place for Buddhists. Also, they kept hitting us with their selfie sticks, but thats not the fault of the temple in any way."

As part of the admission you can visit the Grand Palace. Actually, you must see the Grand Palace as it is on the way out via the only exit. Also, at the very end of your journey you will be able to go into the Queen Sirikit Museum. This is also included in the temple admission so why not check it out?

This was the only wat I encountered (so far) in Bangkok that pictures were not allowed inside but I could get over that. What was more surprising was that the emerald buddha is tiny; maybe that's why pictures are not allowed, because they don't want people thinking they may have wasted their time before your baht is in their pocket. I was literally jaw dropped at the tiny size of this buddha and, unlike most temples visited, quick to leave.Do not allow this to detract you from visiting the Grand Palace though, it is beautiful.

He proceeded to tell us where else to visit one of which was a special export centre which was open to the public for just one week a year and today was the final day. It sold expensive jewellery to the trade normally but one week a year opened its doors to the public and was run on behalf of the Thai government (so he told us). He flagged down a passing Tuk Tuk and told the driver where to take us and that because it was a \"special\" week he would only charge us 100 baht for the whole afternoon showing us temples and the export centre. He told us the government paid Tuk Tuk drivers for their fuel on this special day so tourists can enjoy the delights of Bangkok. We went to the first temple where there was only one guy in there. He started chatting to us, and he told us he was on holiday from the UK but his family were from Singapore. He asked where we had been and where we planned to go for the rest of the day. We mentioned about the export centre and he got very excited telling us he had just come from there and bought lots of ruby gems at a huge discount as there were no taxes to pay so these pieces were upto 200% cheaper than normal. He told us we must go and showed us photos of the items he said he had bought. Eventually we got to the \"export\" centre which was called \"Mannee Thai\". The \"Manager\" there repeated the same line - that it was government controlled and they were open to the public just this week only and that we could each buy 3 pieces of jewellery at huge discount without paying tax. The pieces they showed us looked really good but we know nothing about jewellery. My wife is recovering from life saving surgery so I thought it might be great to buy her some special jewellery if we didn't have to pay then taxes on them. We ended up buying 2 pieces for quite a lot of money and filled in some forms to confirm they were for personal use and not for resale or business. We came away from there feeling happy and a little later on called our daughter to tell her the story. She immediately became suspicious and told us to research the \"export\" centre on Google. We couldn't believe what we read - we had been the victims of a sophisticated scam involving the \"gateman\" at the temple - the Tuk Tuk driver - The guy who pretended to be a fellow tourist from the UK in the temple and of course the store itself. The stories on google from other tourist \"victims\" of this scam told a very similar tale of how they ended up in the same place. We called the police the following day and went down to the nearby Police Station. The officer there was helpful and took us to the store but the staff there were completely different to the previous day. There were also a couple of \"heavies\" who came out from the shadows who were a little intimidating. The Police officer told the Manager we wanted a refund but she said we were only entitled to 80% refund because of the \"contract\" we had signed. She was very brazen and didn't seem concerned about the police officers presence. We told her we had been told by her colleague the previous day that the store was government run and there were no taxes to pay but she disputed this and said we must have misunderstood. Eventually, after a few heated exchanges, the police officer phoned the local \"tourist police\". I spoke to an interpreter who explained this \"scam\" was well known to them but there was little they could do because we ha entered the store of our own free will and purchased the jewellery at a price we agreed. I explained that was true but we had been misled by the claims of there being no taxes to pay and reassured by the statement that the store was controlled by the government, so we believed we were dealing with a reputable and safe merchandiser. We were told this was not a criminal matter but rather it was a civil dispute, unless we could prove the jewellery was fake. The interpreter also told us the store operating this scam made their money from the 20% it retained after refunding most tourists the 80%. We refused to accept the 80% and instead contacted our credit card provider who put a hold on the payment pending an investigation into the \"dispute\". We have no idea how things will finally work out but the message we send here is that if you are approached in a similar way please don't fall into the same trap that we did. We are educated people and normally very cautious but were thrown off our normal course by the amount of people involved in the operation of the scam. Put a huge cloud over our stay in Bangkok, which is a real shame."

Just practicalities:1.Arrive early, preferably before the gates open at 8.30am. Start your day of sightseeing with this particular attraction! There will still be a crowd but at least manageable. Besides, that early the heat is less. The ticket is 500 Bahts per person but is well worth every Baht as this is the most revered Thai temple and consequently most visited . The temple compound is rather crammed with numerous fabulous buildings, statues, stoops etc, all dripping with gold. Further more reason to come early to avoid the maddening crowds later. We needed 1.5h for the Temple and another 1.5h for the Palace and finished just before mid-day including some break for a drink. At the time the crowds at the entrance and ticket office nearly prevented us from leaving. See what I mean?2.To get there best use a taxi but make sure they use a meter. Taxis are cheap and reliable plus give you a moment of respite in their air-conditioned, cool interior. Tipping welcome(10Bahts perhaps?)3.Observe the dress code: long trousers, covered shoulders and knees or you won\u2019t get let in. Can use a sarong if you like and after fold it for the rest of the day. Taking photos of the inside of the buildings is not permitted. The place simply takes your breath away and briskly transports you to the fairyland."

I hired a tour guide in the end- she was knowledgeable and gave good advice on where to stand to photograph or video vistas in the palace complex. She also lent me a very colourful shirt to hide my ' bare arms'! Beware the strict dress code. She threw in a bottle of water and provided shade with her umbrella. A useful trick by the guides was to have pre-purchased tickets to beat the queues. Very useful lady. Don't try and photograph the jade Buddha - I witnessed the officials dragging offenders bodily over to instant 'fine' boxes to atone for the disrespect. That also applied to zoomed photos through the open entrance but was clearly harder to police. "

There were hordes of people from tour groups and the worst crush of people I have ever seen other than watching TV pictures of Times Square on New Years Eve. There was virtually no crowd control -- no organization to the process of removing and storing shoes before entering the temple -- and people were packed so tightly that it was impossible to go anywhere. I would suggest trying to go to this temple in late afternoon, when (perhaps) the hordes of tour groups have left. Or go to Wat Po, which is far less crowded, and in my view has more interesting buildings and the very good massage center."

Tickets are not sold at the gate, but at a booth following security check.Remember this ticket set also covers Dusit sights such as Vimanmek Mansion and Ananda Samakhorn Throne Hall. Best way to arrive is via express river boat, use Tha Chang pier to disembark and walk straight down the road to the opening in the huge white wall. Once into the temple grounds, murals line the walls. Many fine Buddha depictions, and of course in the ordination bot is the most prized, the Emerald Buddha.

The architecture is impressive and all the sculptures too. The small temples you can visit (with pants and shoulders covered) are all very beautiful and seems peaceful even with the crowd there. (There is a good respect). Don't answer to anything people tell you outside of the temple, it is taxi drivers that will tell you its closed, or can't go with pants, and than will drive you somewhere else to buy things from them. We however passed by the Grand Palace that is not really worth it (this explains the 4 out of 5 on my review)"

With a 500 baht admission fee for foreigners I was not in a hurry to visit Wat Phra Kaew again, but I had visitors from Australia so it fell to me to take them there.Thais are admitted free to this temple, the most sacred in Thailand, and it is a cause of controversy and commentary that foreigners are charged 500 baht. There are frequent letters on the subject to the editors of the English language press in Thailand.Having said that, Wat Phra Kaew, or the Temple of the Emerald Buddha as it is more commonly known, is a \"must see\" for any first-time visitor to Bangkok.The Emerald Buddha is probably the most sacred item in Thailand and only the King or his son, the Crown Prince, are allowed to touch it, which they do when they change its seasonal robes. Although it is called the Emerald Buddha, it is in fact carved from jade.The temple grounds are a kaleidoscope of mosaic walls, murals, giant guardian demons, apsaras (angels) stupas and smaller wats.Wat Phra Kaew is still plagued by scam artists at the entrance gates who rush to meet you when you approach the temple to tell you it is closed to foreigners today \"because of a religious ceremony\". They then offer to take you on a private tour of Bangkok, which inevitably includes stopping off at jewelers shops and silk shops where you are under heavy pressure to purchase something.Don't be taken in. Proceed to the gates and check out for yourself whether it is closed or not.Modest dress is obligatory, which means below the knee dresses and shorts, and no exposed shoulders or plunging necklines."

We took a taxi ride because the river crossing was closed. I like walking and i walk miles with dogs but I don't think I would of wanted to walk from Wat Arun to Wat Phra Kaew. Distance and safety, Bangkok is a dangerous city, this isn't just my opinion it's from someone who lives and works in Bankok. We knew the Wat would be closed but we enjoyed the walk around the outside and taking photos of Wat and surrounding area, It must of taken around 30 minites or more, if you try it in the day time I can imagine you will get very warm, It was still busy along the pavement with people selling things. We didn't walk through that area for safety reasons. Probably ok but not worth the risk. I would love to see this place at night from inside the grounds, just to take some photos of the building. It's a wow factor. This is my second trip to Bangkok and a must see next time. I hope it's spectacular in the day."

We had a guide, and it was very worthwhile, to learn about the history and the relevance of each building. It can get very hot as the sun reflects off the buildings and pavements, so it is advisable to take a god supply of water with you. Also there are rules to abide by, dress modestly covering shoulders and knees, take off shoes when entering temples, do not drink in the temples (we witnessed a lady being escorted out of the Emerald Buddha temple for taking a sip of water) and do not take photographs if it is forbidden. This was the case in The Emerald Buddha temple, our guide informed us that not only would the offending photograph be deleted but the memory chip would be wiped clean."

Talking on religion related, some of them may do chanting across between old and new year. Some of them do a temple tour for worship for 9 temples. Why 9 ? Nine in Thai word is \"Kao\" which is short representing \"Kaona\" or progressive in the meaning. And one of hot spot among those 9 temples is of course the Emerald Buddha (Grand Palace). I went there yesterday for the same purpose but I did 1 only. It's always great to be there eventhough this time it's pretty much fulled with tourist. Of course, majority is from China (again) for apporx. 40% and the rest are from other countries including local Thai. This time of the year the Buddha will wear the winter clothing which is a real gold allover. The Buddha will gets change next time a summer clothing and rainy season clothing respectively - which will be in different style too. Buddha clothing will be changed by the Royal Crown Prince only on behalf of the King. It's only small story sharing here due to a limited of comment space. By the way, I wish everyone visiting Thailand a prosperous year and whatever you guys wish for may come true. Happy new year 2016 !"

The Emerald Buddha is kept in a nice building around the palace grounds. You are not allowed to take pictures from the inside but sometimes you can see the Buddha from the outside and you can take the pictures. The Buddha is not very big as the other Buddhas but it certainly is emerald green and beautiful. When the season in Thailand changes the Buddha will be dressed in that season\u2019s theme. It is called the Emerald Buddha but we are not sure if it\u2019s real emerald or not. The other buildings in the temple are amazing too! The architecture is superb and gold is everywhere. The buildings are usually tall and mostly in gold color, some buildings have small colored mirrors and plates on them to create an image or pattern. There was an area where the walls are painted too! The old pictures on the walls are all made to tell stories about the history and the mythical events. The paintings are very detailed that it almost look like real trees and buildings. It was a great temple but it sometimes get very crowded during the afternoon. So it will be very hot when we can\u2019t show many parts of our skin. There are sometimes pick pockets too so don\u2019t bring too much stuff. And don\u2019t take too much pictures or it will not be respectful to the temple\u2019s property."

The temple is gorgeous with high pillars and lots of colored glass (I think); the architecture is stunning. You have to take off your shoes (but you don't need to wear socks, although the tiles in the sun obviously get scorching hot) and leave them outside, but don't worry about anyone taking your shoes. Once you get inside make sure to point your feet away from the Buddha to show respect. No photos or video allowed, although if you want a photo of the Buddha you can take one from outside - there's a space to see in, although your photo won't be that great. People are meditating and praying inside, so please be respectful. I've only visited in December, so it's the 'cold' season, so Buddha wears his cold season jacket - I find it fascinating they change his attire for the seasons! The statue is not made of real emerald but rather jade or something like it, but it's still amazing to see. It's also pretty hot inside as there are a lot of people jostling for a view and only a fan or two. Definitely a must see while you're at the Grand Palace!"

However, the strict rules make it very difficult to enjoy it. My family was denied to enter due to inappropriate dressing, however both my dad and brother wore shorts that covered their knees. We were not aware that they need to come in long sleeve trousers, so prepare to be rigorously checked (some people passed the first control, but then they were returned at the second control after they bought their tickets). I understand the several security checkpoints and the strong presence of soldiers and police, however I do not get why is it necessary that they shout with the visitors for any reason. It is so crowded that probably it is challenging to keep the order, but after paying 500 baht (which is crazy much compared to other temples where you pay around 100 baht) you want to have a relaxing time and enjoy your visit. I personally could not enjoy the visit, despite that the site is breathtaking."

The Emerald Buddha itself was much smaller than expected even though we'd read it measures 45 cm. The temple was dark inside after coming in from a blazing sunny day outside. A worship service was in progress, and no photographs were allowed inside. Considering it nothing unusual to find groups worshiping at Christian holy places anywhere in the world, we should not be surprised at similar devotions taking place here. The devout are everywhere in the complex, not just inside with the Emerald (actually jade) Buddha."

I thought that maybe it would be a good idea to limit the number of tourists at any one time to preserve the temple atmosphere. You are required to take off your shoes prior to entering the temple and you wonder if your shoes among the sea of footwear would still there when you come back.

Inside the temple, the emerald Buddha room was a bit crowded, but we were able to sit down for a while and take in statues and paintings in the walls.We then had plenty of time to get the history of the place and get some fun stories from the guide.The Emerald Buddha visit was the highlight of our trip."

We were also told that we visited out of peak tourist season so I hate to think what it's like during peak times. Often we had to fight our way through huge crowds of tourists to see anything and the massive downpour of rain didn't help but obviously that couldn't be avoided as it was monsoon season! It may considerably help matters if they limited the number of people entry at one time. The majority of people were very respectful during their time and wore the appropriate clothing (which was checked at entry) but sadly there were a select few people that weren't and they did make a poor impression. We have a responsibility as tourists to leave a good impression of our country as undoubtedly, people will make generalisations. Beware the market stall sellers & tuk tuk drivers as they will try and tell you all manner of stories en route, such as 'the temple is closed exclusively for monk worship today', 'you are not dressed appropriately and so they won't let you in' (they offer you alternative clothing for a returnable deposit on entry at the temple so there really is no excuse) & 'it's going to be too busy today, come back another day and we'll take you to another site'. All of this sounds quite negative at the moment but I have still given the attraction a 'very good' rating as sadly a lot of this you will experience anywhere in Thailand and as a visitor to the country, you should prepare and adapt to it.All of that aside, the buildings were magnificent and at times when the crowds dispersed for a brief second I did get quite overwhelmed with the beauty and atmosphere within the temples. If you are open-minded to the different world that is Thailand you have entered into then you will reap the rewards of this beautiful attraction."

So ladies, you can wear your shorts in the heat and humidity, while using the sarong to cover up (sarongs are sort of like long beach wraps), and also make sure your shoulders are covered. Don't make the mistake of wearing long pants thinking you're covered and will be allowed into this temple. There's a sign saying only women with skirts are allowed in and if you attempt to go in while wearing pants you will be whipped. Not seriously whipped, but there's a little dude who will appear out of nowhere with a few thin sticks and whip you a few times so you get the message. It's actually a bit comical. Also, no pictures inside the temple, you'll get whipped for that one too. So even with long pants, you'll need a sarong to wrap around yourself. Gents,your knees and shoulders have to be covered as well. Street vendors sell a light material pants that the guys can use to cover up. But don't let the dress rules deter you from visiting this temple because it's worth a visit. And like most temples in south east Asia, you have to cover up anyways, so just be respectful."

This is the most crowded area inside Grand Palace Complex!Emerald being a soft stone, it's not possible to make Buddha from Emerald Actually. So, u got it right, that this Buddha is not of Emerald, but some type of Green Stones. But still it's popularly known as Emerald Buddha!Photography is prohibited inside, but still found lots of people taking snaps.The Temple is a live one, so you need to pay Respect to Thai Culture and Devotion, they show towards Lords Buddha, Like Do not Spread your Legs Toward Buddha and always sit inside the inner arena and don't remain stand up.As a whole, if you are in Grand Palace, this one is a must."

On the upper terrace, you can admire the mini stone Angor Wat, the golden Aponsi (a mythical half woman half lion statue), and the beautiful colors of the Royal Pantheon.

At the entrance there are guides who offer you to take you around in different languages in 1 hour, but 1 hour is not enough! take the Personal Audio Guide (PAG) for 200 Baht for 2 hours, because of the locals english accent, its a better choice. 1 is enough for 2 person if you use 1 headset each."

You'll be photographing non-stop.Once you've seen the temples, then visit the gates of the Grand Palace and see the royal guards on sentry duty and some of the grand royal buildings nearby within the compound.Situated right next to the Reclining Buddah compound, it's best to put aside a day and see both attractions. They are the principal Bangkok Thai cultural attractions.If you only see these two sites, you can leave BKK having seen the best."

There is a small snack / ice cream bar inside the compound. It is a huge compound, with a couple of museums also. Be prepared to walk a lot among jostling crowds.

I just wish we had a chance to really enjoy the sight in peace."

Once you have entered the Wat housing the Statue, you will see the 2 foot high Jade image of a seated Buddha well above eye level. The Buddha dats back to the 1400's and has been housed in this Temple since the late 1700's.By tradition it is clothed in gold robes-- and the Kingor Crown Prince comes here 3 times each year to change the dress at the start of the seasons ( Summer, Cool and Rainy).Definitely impressive, as is the entire Grad Palace complex, and yet another 'must see' for Bangkok"

The Emerald Buddha, located high atop the alter of the main temple building, is beautiful and is attired by the monks for each season. Please do not fail to visit this temple while you are in Bangkok.And, as others have noted, pay attention to the presence of pickpockets. Don't carry a wallet in a rear pocket.

Avoid the hassle of queuing by dressing modestly.

But don't let the squeezing that is needed to get into the place deter you from going in. Once in, most tour group immediately visits the main emerald temple at the centre. While they does that, simply walk around the perimeter of the ground and believe me you won't be disappointed. There's just beauty everywhere (definitely lots of instagram worthy spots!) and most importantly it's quiet with no tourist group in sight. After exploring the perimeter you can then slowly explore the center portion where all the main architecture are found, which by then the number of tour group should have lessen as they head out for lunch.Definitely a must-visit place in Bangkok. Although the entrance fee is a tad too expensive, but it was definitely worth it. There's water refill point around the temple too to quench your thrist."

You get an idea, entering the Royal Palace and Wat Phra Kaew, that the Burmese sack of Ayutthaya in 1767 didn't put as much a dent in the coffers of the Thai monarchy as it's usually assumed. Moving to Thonburi across the river and then onto Bangkok, Wat Phra Kaew was built to house the Emerald Buddha.You notice immediately that Gold. Is. Everything. Every building, every sculpture, and most importantly every roof is adorned in gold leaf mixed with crystal panelling. The Ramakien is told along the wall of the external shaded pathway, and even that is painted in gold.The temples soar. You see them for a mile crossing the field from the north, and are visible as far away as Wat Pho to the south. There are so many pagodas and stupas there that once you enter you find it impossible to count them all. Some are gold, some purple, some blue and white, but all of them are a thing of majesty.Remember: long pants (they will give you some for a deposit) and covered shoulders - this is the king's palace still, and it's considered a form of lese-majeste to not obey the dress code. Touts outside the gates will tell you that the temple is closed and will try to take you to the \"Big Buddha\" temple (aka the Grand Extortion) - don't listen. The palace and Wat Phra Kaew have loudspeakers warning tourists about this. It is open every day! Enjoy it every day!"

For men, full-length trousers (no shorts, cutoffs). If you do not conform to the dress code, you will have to stand in another queue to go to the changing room where you will have to pay THB200 for a sarong or trousers. The money is refunded to you after you return the clothing.The temple is one of the highlights of the visit to the Grand Palace. Photography is not allowed inside.

With peak season, taking photos was very hard and frustrating as everyone was pushing each other away from their photos and etc. However disregarding other unwanted tourists, as we all do, the Temple was amazingly built to tower all of us humans. The palace was massive, walking around can take at least a minimum of 1.5hrs, not included how much picture perfect photos you want to take. There were thai art painted on the interiors of the temple, which told the mythical legends of Heaven and Hell, surrounding the human world, of course in a Buddhism context. There were also huge statues of the protectors between the gateway from human to the spirit world. Additionally, the Emerald Buddha was a highlight, worth seeing, unfortunately no photos was allowed inside the temple, taking the photo from the outside wasn't enough to describe how the Emerald Buddha looked, I guess you all will have to go to visit him yourselves!"

The only bad thing about visiting the temple is the amount of tourists in this place, we were lucky to find a tour within the temple that's English guided free tour (but please tip afterwards) Our guide Jeffrey is very knowledgeable and he know all the history about both the Grand Palace and the Temple, which we learned so much about everything here. I'm not sure if there's a slow tourist season, but if there is one, come visit during that time."

Went inside and bought our tickets for 500 Baht. - the most expensive ticket we purchased but definitely the most worth it. Suggest you go to The Grand Palace by the Chao Phraya River and just walk towards it. Of course you have to remember the basics when travelling in Thailand:1. Wear or bring soft cotton pants. You cannot go inside if you're wearing shorts. But it so hot so better bring those cotton pants.2. Bring LOT OF WATER. There are water dispensers available in the area, so don't throw away your bottle.3. Wear nice socks. You will be exposing them. lol.4. BRING A CAMERA. If you like pictures, and you forgot your camera, just go home. You'll regret not bringing a camera. :P5. Respect the Thai tradition. If they say no picture taking, so please don't do it. it's plain simple.6. Visit the coin museum. Not only it is cold there, but it will give you a change to see some of Thailand's royal family's history. Very interesting."

Some part of the paintings are painted in gold making those part embossed and beauitful. Seems like some history but no hint at all. Better go early so that you can spend more time in the compound.

People from many country would come and visit the temple and it would be really packed and hot.  If you have a Thai national you don\u2019t need to buy the ticket but, if you are foreigner you need to buy the ticket in order to visit temple. The price of the ticket isn\u2019t that high and it worth the price.  Overall it was a nice and fantastic temple if it wasn\u2019t too crowded and hot.

I highly recommend getting the map so that you can find your way around and know what you're looking at, as otherwise it just looks like a lot of beautiful buildings grouped together. You aren't allowed to take photos of the Emerald Buddha so keep that in mind as it is enforced. Inside the temple is absolutely beautiful and I found it really peaceful and calming to sit for a couple of minutes and check out the inside and just sit with all of these people from all over the world coming together to pray in front of this statue. The Buddha itself is not that interesting, it's pretty small and you have to sit at a distance from it. I was really impressed with the level of upkeep of the temple though, and there is a box where you can leave a donation towards this but that is optional. Just make sure you dress appropriately, wear shoes that are easy to take off, and take water! It is seriously crowded and gets really, really hot, especially with that Thai humidity."

So all of the Tuk Tuks around the Temples will offer to drive you around the city for practically free, but their true intentions are to take you to shops that pay them commission for bringing in tourists. Nothing wrong with that, except that is good to know what is going on. This one time I tried to hire a Tuk Tuk because it was raining, I offered to pay him good if he would take me to the Skytrain station, NO STOPS on the way. He refused. He insisted on at least ONE stop, the suits factory. I refused. I said NO stops, straight to Skytrain station. He insisted on at least ONE stop or there would be no deal..There was no deal! I don't know how much commission they get, but must be a lot for them to put it as a condition for a ride. Nothing wrong with that, just be informed."

Lastly, if you go there you will miss this temple so much. It is very pretty temple. Thai people also love this temple."

Take time to visit the museum next to it to understand the restoration process."

Photos are not permitted inside the actual temple housing the Emerald Buddha but that's not a problem - there are lots of excellent guide books available at very cheap prices. You can even get cold towels, which are much appreciated if you are not used to the humidity.ONE WARNING - the ferry stop near the temple has one of the 'local attractions' you want to avoid. A smartly dressed middle-aged man complete w/ briefcase and 'Tourist Police' badge (which was flashed very quickly) approached us as we left the ferry and warned us to be careful of pick-pockets, etc. He then produced a map and gave us directions to the temple but told us it wasn't open for another couple of hours and suggested another place to visit. At this point a local young lady who had just left the ferry told us not to take any notice of what he was saying, that he was known in the area as a fraud (as was his Tourist Police badge) and he would just try to get us to the other attraction - probably a shop owned by him or his family. Not surprisingly he disappeared very quickly but was still hanging around the ferry waiting area when we returned several hours later. Be careful!"

He chatted us up for a while and I said I just wanted to walk by anyway. My husband, who had been a cop for 25 years, didn't even realize we were being scammed! All that being said, it was a beautiful place. If you are not dressed appropriately, you can rent cloths. My husband had to pay 20 baht for a pair of loose pants, he got his deposit back when the pants were returned. No where else in Thailand did we encounter that.

The ceiling and walls are covered with murals. The outer wall of the compound has a covered roof that goes all the way around the interior walls. It is open to the inner court of the temple grounds. The interior wall of the compound is completely covered with murals documenting the history of Thailand in the Asian style. The mural was painted about 80 years ago and much of it has been restored recently. We spent about 1/2 of our time on the temple grounds walking around looking at the murals. The rest of the time was spent taking pictures, admiring the statues and buildings in the middle of the compound and then going into the place of worship to watch the Buddhists worship and see the curious workmanship there. My wife and I wore shoes, pants and button up travel shirts. I would visit this location again in a few years if I went with friends that had never been."

It was hard to enjoy the beauty of the place with so many people there focused more on getting the perfect selfie and less on the gorgeous surroundings around us. I also went on a weekend so that probably contributed to the crowds. I suggest you get there early!Tip: regarding attire for this visit, you should definitely wear clothing that covers below the knee. Most tops with sleeves were ok, no need to wear clothing to the elbows. And despite the concierge at my hotel being concerned about my sandals they were fine. Note to women, just covering your shoulders with a shawl won't fly here you need to have a proper shirt to pass inspection."

Emerald Buddha is part of the Grand Palace complex, which cost us 500 baht per person to enter. You need to dress appropriately to enter, which means no shorts or short skirts, covering your knees/shins, shoulders, chest and mid-section. I would also recommend slip-on shoes since you need to remove them before entering any temples. The temple is beautiful with amazing intricate details - the entire grounds feel very peaceful and breathtaking, so take your time and enjoy it. But please be respectful of their culture. Don't point your feet to Buddha or turn your back to him. These are important religious grounds for the Thai people.

So you will also be visiting the Palace at the same time. There is an entrance fee for both together. Ticket cost is 500 Baht (over priced )One of the easiest way to reach it is to take a BTS Silom line to Sapan Taskin station and the exit will take you directly to Central Pier from where you can take a Orange flag boat to Pier N9 (fare 15 Baht per trip per person). Just walk of the pier and you will come to a cross road.

Going straight along the white wall you from the junction will take you to Grand Palace.DO NOT GET MISLEAD by self proclaimed English speaking guides or tuk tuk drivers who say the place is closed and will offer you a tour elsewhere. Another scam is that if you are not wearing the right attire. Your dress has to cover your knees and ladies will have to wear tops with sleeves. At the entrance they will provide with the proper attire FREE OF COST. Do not get mislead by some one from outside trying to sell you a dress to visit the palace.Palace is open from 8 a.m. Avoid week ends, we landed there in a week end and there was hardly any place for you to step without running into others. Also ideal will be to reach the place early as crowd builds up after eleven.If you want some one to explain take a guide who will charge you at least 100 or 200 Baht per hour but for just a visit follow the arrow marks.The temple itself is very good. The Buddha will be dressed as per the season - hot, rainy, or spring."

Basically the buildings are unlike anything we're used to, since well they are incredibly colourfull and shiny and vry, very intricately decorated everywhere. The buddha itself is, well actually pretty small, since it's made of a single jade stone. Small but very impressive. The part that we and especially my kids liked most was the mural all along the outer wall which we guess tells the (mythological) story of Thailand and its rulers. We didn't get an audio guide and apparantly there is no booklet for sale explaining it. Which we think is a greatly missed opportunity.

I've been to a number of temples around Asia, but this was definitely one of the most impressive. The detail was incredible. Each building was unique. Each painting was unique. Do make sure you are respectful of their rules. I saw a man begging a guard to return his phone as he was escorted out of the building for taking photos.The Emerald Buddha itself is quite small. As it's housed in such a spectacular room I at first didn't realise that I had seen it and walked around the complex looking for it. Another friend also thought she'd missed it, so it's possibly a common mistake.The fee of 500 baht is quite high, but includes entrance to the Grand Palace and, we found out later, Dusit Palace (definitely worth the visit) and probably some other places, but I didn't have time to see any more."

I would say, don't get the audio guide, it is expensive in my opinion and with the map you are good enough (maps have explanations).. also, if you rent the audio guide, they give you 2h to do the whole visit (the temple + royal palace) so you can't really go at your pace. It is a great place to spend a lot of time there, but it get really hot, so bring water (and lots).You can't take pictures inside the chapel where the Emerald Buddha is, but everywhere else you can."

Located in the Grand Palace, the whole complex was an amazing array of temples and buildings surrounded by glorious statues and mural-ed walkways. Arrived in the morning and it was already filled to the brim with tourists and some of the Chinese groups were pretty distracting to put it politely.Be prepared to spend 3-4 hours looking around and it was very hot when I was there with little respite, so look out for the water stores and buy 2-3 bottles as they weren't easy to find.Got some amazing images and memories and very pleased I went. Big tip is to dress for the visit, wear long pants and a sleeved shirt - those who had to get clothes to cover up had a queue a mile long and they were forking out time and money for just being pretty ignorant.A must see with the Temple of the Reclining Buddha while in Bangkok."

You have to leave a deposit of 200TBH per item (this was 800TBH for two trousers and two shirts) - clothing is light but still exceptionally warm and does not get washed between uses. Once finished you are expected to join a queue. However, hat nobody tells you is that you need to return the clothing, get your ticket stamped and then join the queue to receive your deposit back. This confused numerous people and involved people queuing twice! The whole process takes about 30 minutes. What's also frustrating is they insist on giving you back the exact notes you left, rather than just distribute notes from a till based on what your receipt says - this delays the whole process and is enough for me to say don't bother going unless you've got your own long clothing. Add to this the fact that tickets are 500TBH each and they let far too many people in at once, I'd save your time and money and visit the Reclining Buddha instead!"

When we have friends or family come to Thailand we take them to interesting sights. In June we took our family to the Temple of the Emerald Buddha. This has been a \u201cmust do\u201d for all visitors to Thailand.We arrived at the temple about 8:30 AM only to be surrounded by masses of tourists. The walkways to the area to purchase the tickets were totally jammed but we were successful in purchasing tickets. Since the tours had already arranged their tickets they did not compete in this line. After obtaining tickets we queued to go in. My wife, being Thai, was in the Thai line but was unceremoniously shoved aside by a tour guide from another country so he could take his group in ahead of her.Once inside the place was totally jammed with people taking photos, selfies and talking. The serenity of a Thai Buddhist temple was not in evidence.We won\u2019t be going to this temple in the future. It\u2019s off our list permanently. We\u2019ll suggest our friends watch a video of how it used to be and visit one of the many other temples in Thailand that are more representative of how a Buddhist temple should be.The Thai government could correct this problem but the temptations of mass tourism and money are so great. They could set a daily limit on the number of people that can visit this temple i.e. 25% of those presently. Also the Buddhist Sabbath which occurs every 7 or 8 days could be reserved for Thais only to practice their faith. Tour groups could easily plan around these dates. However in the days of money tourism neither of these changes are likely."

So if like us, you opted not to hire a tour guide outside, you miss out on the history etc of the place.The Buddha is just amazing to see. But I guess holds more significance for those that are Buddhists.Must see once."

Google to look for pictures of this place instead of braving it yourself.Icing on the cake of this disastrous visit was the visit to the gift shop when the salesgirl rolled her eyes and let out an irritated grunt that I've interrupted her social chat with her colleague when I asked for help."

The entrance fee was 500 Baht per person and it gives you access to the temple, the grand palace and a museum. We did the temple and grand palace and then headed out to Wat Pho. They do have a dress code but they also supply you with a sarong if needed. We bought a scarf and a sarong outside for cheap since we knew we would be doing multiple temples. You don't have to do that it was just our preference. There are no time limits to visiting the temple you can do it in 1 hour or 4 hours. We took about 2 and a half hours to walk around. The surrounding architectures really make the place special, the emerald buddha is very small compared to the larger scale of the grounds but it is worth it to see it."

The ticket itself is 500 THB (about $15 USD), plus 200 THB for the optional self-paced audio tour (available in multiple languages). I do not know if you can get into the Wat itself without paying for the whole Grand Palace ticket. This is an amazing temple complex that includes several buildings built over several hundred years of Thai History. This Wat is unique in that it does not have any monks living there permanently, but instead was initially intended as a worship place for the King. Now it is mostly a tourist location, but people are still expected to act with reverence and respect when in the presence if the Emerald Buddha who is inside the Wat.Around the walls of the Wat and the outer buildings are paintings from the Ramakian (the most famous Epic of Thailand), which I personally find to be the most interesting part of the temple. However, there is plenty of architectural and cultural attractions within this Wat and outer buildings to keep just about anyone interested. All and all this is a Must-see for anyone visiting Thailand. The audio tour itself is well worth the 200 THB that it costs. It will have you walk around the Wat Parakaew and Grand Palace in a specific order that takes about 2 hours. It tells the history and architectural features of many the buildings, and points out unique features to look for. Tips for traveler: Wear appropriate clothing! Sleeves must cover shoulders / mid arm length, and long skirts (for female) or long clean pants (for men), are required. It is possible to rent or purchase sarongs for about 100 THB if you do not have these. No shoes, cameras, backpacks, hats, etc are allowed within the temple of the Emerald Buddha if self. For this reason I recommend bringing any money or valuables in a separate neck or belt pouch. Additionally, you are expected to sit down I front of the Buddha and do not face your feet in his direction. All of this is described within the Audio Tour."

Upon entering the temple per se, you will have to take off your shoes so if you don't feel that confortable going barefoot, put on socks as well or bring a pair to put on when taking off your shoes. The fee (the most expensive of all the attractions in BKK) includes the temple and grounds plus the Royal Palace AND entrance to the WIMANEK mansion across town, so keep the good half of the ticket safe if you want to visit the mansion and grounds (including the FABULOUS Throne Hall).

We had another day back in Bangkok on our way back, and as we hadn't seen the Emerald Buddha yet we made this a priority. By this time we had already seen quite a few temples across Thailand, and while the temples themselves were nice, we actually weren't that impressed with the Emerald Buddha. Maybe we are being harsh because we had seen so much already, but I think we had heard so much about it that it was a bit of an anti climax. It is probably still worth a visit, but if I was returning on a second visit I wouldn't go back personally. Be sure you bring water with you as it's very crowded and hot, and remember you can't wear footwear in to the temple so wear something comfortable that you can slip on/off easily"

The building are lovely. The palace grounds are very colorful (if not gaudy). Unfortunately, we visited the Temple of the Reclining Buddha first (which is HUGE!) so when we got to the Temple of the Emerald Buddha (which is really jade), it just seemed soooooo tiny. You walk into this room with a massive golden alter. You can't get even slightly close to it, and at the very tippy top of it is a tiny greenish figurine. It took me several minutes to realize that THAT was the famous Emerald Buddha. It almost made me chuckle. Sure for being a solid piece of carved jade, yes it was impressive, but why have it so high and far away? The alter itself was more impressive than the Buddha itself. I don't discourage you from going to see it, but if you have a choice in terms of which order you see things, go to the Temple of the Reclining Buddha second or else the jade buddha will seem even smaller than it actually is."

Each time I find new things to see and appreciate regarding Thai culture. There is so much to see that it is easy to get sensory overload. Although appropriate clothing can be obtained on site, it is best to review the clothing restrictions ahead of time and dress accordingly. Wat Phra Kaew and the Grand Palace are excellent for learning about Thai culture."

Women can wear pants, skirt or a modest dress with below knee length and sleeves. The temple is a sacred ground, where people worship, so be respectful. The Emerald Buddha's robe is changed 4 times a year by the King or his designee. There are much culture and arts to appreciate. Shoes are not allowed inside the building. I have visited some other temples and lost shoes. Someone either wore them by mistake or had stolen them. i learned from that experience to bring a plastic bag for my shoes then put them in my knapsack rather then not having a pair of shoes to wear. The temple might be closed for official ceremonies, so be sure to check before going. The temple may be reached by boat, bus, or taxi. Beware of scammers lurking outside the temple. They seem to be polite and helpful and would suggest other temples and places to visit. They would tell you that the temple doesn't open until later because of some legitimate sounding reason\u3002They would tell you about some government promotional sales that you don't want to miss as it was the last day. If you fell for it, they would help you get in to a Tuk Tuk (motorized trishaw) that would cost 40 Bahts to take you to all these wonderful places and back in time for the temple's opening. Once you get in to the Tuk Tuk, you are taken to see a few Buddhas. Another person would approach and help you go to the promotional sale. The Tuk Tuk would take you to a small clothing shop operated by Indians. There, they would try to make you have suits and shirts made for ridiculously high price. If you say you have no Thai money, they would say that any currency would do. They would go as far as having you show them the knid of money you have in your wallet. They would have someone take you to an ATM machine to show you how to withdraw money. If you have gone that far, you might be paying big bucks for junk stuff they claimed to have tailored made for you. If you realized you have been scammed and try to get out, they find every which way to hold on to you. Get out quickly as one never knows what might happen next. This is true as it happened to my friends, who were lucky enough to get out. If you do not want to be scammed, don't easily believe In strangers. Check legitimacy to avoid becoming a victim.

The main building is the most lavish building i have ever seen, and I was rendered speechless by it for a good ten minutes! That being said, i enjoyed Wat Pho and Wat Arun more because they were equally awe inspiring in their own ways and not overwhelmingly crowded."

The Temple of the Emerald Buddha is situated in the Royal Palace complex.Failing to visit Wat Phra Kaew - the Temple of the Emerald Buddha, would be like missing out the Vatican and the Sistine Chapel in Rome.Let me offer two reasons for this.1. The sheer scale of the glittering, soaring beauty of the Temple itself is beautiful. You can photograph and film to your heart's content - from outside the Temple. Wat Phra Kaew is the Holiest of Holy sites in Thailand. Thai Buddhists in particular will make a special visit to the Emerald Buddha - which many of them believe is endowed with 'special powers.'2. The second reason is because, as well as being steeped in centuries of myth and supposed magic the Emerald Buddha, the statue itself is lovely. Until the King of Thailand became ill recently he would ascend the steps around the bot and change the garments of the Emerald Buddha. Each change of clothing to reflect the season of the year - there are three in Thailand.This robing of the Emerald Buddha is now carried out by the son of the King, the Crown Prince.Before you enter the Temple, you must remove your footwear. There are lots of racks - just remember to note the position of your shoes. Don't worry - no person will take your shoes.From the blazing sunlight - you are cast into the muted light of the Inner Temple. Remember, this is a VERY Holy place - so be absolutely respectful. If you try to use a camera of any kind - you will be asked politely to leave. If you insist toclick away - your camera may be confiscated. Respect the rules.There are no chairs - people stand at the back or sit on the floor.When you sit - DO NOT POINT your FEET in the direction of the Buddha. It is a gross insult.The Emerald Buddha statue is very small - so don't expect a colossus. Also \"Emerald\" refers to the colour. The stone of the Emerald Buddha is Green Jade or jasper.Is it lovely - In its special setting, with Thai devotees and a huge sense of peace - yes it is very lovely.Once outside you can buy photos of the Emerald Buddha itself.How to get there?Cheapest and fastest? Take the Skytrain to Saphan Taksin station and walk a few metres into the Public Ferry landing. Unless you are very rich - skip the offers of a long tailed boat for 500 baht - go to the window and buy a ticket to Grand Palace for 11 baht. It is much more comfortable than the long-tailed boats and your fellow passengers are many monks on their way to the many Temples and Schools which line the Chao Praya river.Disembark at the Grand Palace Pier - ask - everyone will help you.Directly in front of you is the Grand Palace.Crooks will come to you and say the Palace is closed - it is a lie - they want to take you to a jewellery shop where they receive large commissions.The Grand Palace is big - make sure you have comfortable shoes.Bare shoulders, midriffs or mini-skirts are NOT permitted. It is a respect thing. For about 100 baht you can 'borrow' a pair of 'pyjama trousers' and a 'drape over blouse'. Enjoy your visit."

The Phra Kaew image is also special. I expected a giant but it's small and a clear object of reverence."

A bigger inconvenience was trying to get a taxi to return to my hotel - I paid three times the price to return to my hotel than I did on the trip to the temple as all taxis refused to use their metre and I had to barter.

The Wat Phra Kaew grounds are stunning and well-maintained, and it's obvious why this site is such a treasure. I particularly enjoyed walking around the buildings surrounding the Temple of the Emerald Buddha, which itself was completed mobbed with people. You can find a nice spot to rest in the shade on the steps of one of the outlying mural halls. HOWEVER, as other reviews have noted, the overwhelming theme is the aggressive mobs of tour groups, seemingly often from China, who move like a battalion of soldiers, unafraid to mow down innocent bystanders who are unlucky enough to get caught in their path. It's really a shame that the temple's administration can't organize timed admissions, so that at least there is some regulation of the crowd. I arrived at 8am for the 8:30 opening, and by 8:15am there was already a queue of bus tour folk pressing against my back to get in. I know that different cultures have different understandings of personal space, but this was still extreme. I'm glad that I went, but be forewarned of this unfortunate aspect. Another tip: a lot of cab drivers around the site seem to want to take advantage of tourists. I went through 4 before 1 agreed to turn his meter on. Be careful!!"

It's impossible to walk to around and admire and appreciate the beauty of this historic and national treasure.Also beware of scammers outside the entrance. They tell you that the Enerald Buddha doesn't open until a certain time when free admission is offered for the day. They try to get you to take a tuk tuk to other sites until it's time to enter the temple. The temple opens daily from 8:30am - 3:30pm. Do not fall for these scams! I think they should do a better job regulating the number of visitors that can enter each time. What a shame! This amazing sight that has such significance in Thai history has become extremely chaotic and nearly impossible to navigate. "

The temple itself is located within the Royal Palace, to get inside, you need to wear closed toe and closed-toe shoes. Those who do not, can be rented at the entrance. Thais are very sensitive to his shrine in the temple is always crowded, people come to ask the Buddha about the performance of their desires.The entrance to the street is a bowl of holy water and a vase with lotuses. Before entering the temple itself need to sprinkle holy water three times by a lotus, then removing the shoes go up to the Temple. In no case can not tread on the threshold, step over. Inside the walls of the temple are painted murals. Buddha statue itself is located at a considerable elevation, a golden throne. Each season, the King of Thailand Buddha disguises in new clothes. We were in November, it is winter in Thai Buddha was dressed in a gold coat, if you can call it that. Could see only green head, a small statue itself -polmetra wide and almost the same height. Pictures in the Temple of smoking, but coming on the street, you can remove the Buddha in the window. it is directly opposite and is always open."

I thought it was too good to be true. Well it actually was - it was cheap but he did take me to many of his 'sponsors' where if you spend time at these places he gets a small commission along with commission on any purchases you make.Nevertheless, this was his livelihood and so I supported that. But he took me to places that I only saw in text books at school, and it was very overwhelming when seeing it finally with my own eyes.This temple was magnificent, you felt the power and energy and I was just in awe at the ancient culture and how strong it was still within Thailand. The people have never negotiated with any of their spiritual values and that's what makes it so special for me. Genuine authenticity.I would highly recommend getting out and seeing this temple in particular. I went on a Tuesday morning, and there wasn't too many tourists and basically had the place to myself to wonder around.Anyways, great experience."

It is the beautiful home of a delightful little emerald Buddha who sits atop an impressive structure. It serves as both a place of worship and a place to stand and admire.The exterior of the temple is beautiful. It is a large building with Buddhist-style design that speaks to the rising sun. Colourful and vivid, the temple is a joy to look at if it can be seen through the hordes of other tourists. It compares well with other temples and is the most important point to see in the Grand Palace complex.Shoes are removed before entering. This does mean the experience is not a pleasure to all the senses, especially inside the temple.Photos are not allowed inside but for anyone with a zoom of pretty much any description it is possible to photograph the Emerald Buddha from outside.The Emerald Buddha itself is fairly small. It is really quite hard to see any detail with the naked eye. It is a radiant green colour enhanced by the lighting effects that focus directly on its presence. The remainder of the interior has less focus but the structure the Buddha sits on is a gleaming and interesting pillar.For those who view Wat Phra Kaew as a place of worship it must be spectacular. For others, the exterior and the location are great though the small size of the Emerald Buddha itself and the impact of so many other people being around does have an effect."

Such beautiful and handsome. And the atmosphere inside was so magical. The Grand Palace Rama I contains a variety of architectural differences, European and Chinese. Bangkok busy traffic. At the entrance to the temple, do not forget to take your shoes off. This applies to all the royal temples in Thailand. In addition to the ruins. Much of the architecture gets certified Gold (gold leaf). It is a beautiful sight. My advice would be to hire a guide who will show you all the temples in Bangkok. It is better to take a Thai guide which will show you and tell you stories. Changing of the Guard pleasant sight. Protection must stand still for 2 hours."

The guides will be standing next to the mural depicting a story about Ramayana (a monkey god and a princess, a similar story as to the one from Bali, the story is reenacted in UluWatu together with a kecak dance).The tour was great as it explained about the current whereabouts of the Buddha artefacts as well as the customs of the Thai people. The temple was in a very beautiful gold and blue shade."

We didn't get close enough to the Emerald Buddha to really see it, but the temple area itself is a dizzying experience of color, stories, and energy. Are we glad we went, yes indeed!

Helpful hints; Shoulders and long trousers - psychodelic long trousers can be bought for 100bht just outside of the temple in the shops so don't hire inside or from guides; don't be fooled when an official guy says the palace closes for lunch...they don't! this is a ploy to bundle you into a tuktuk and take a canal boat ride - don't be afraid to say no at the river if this happens; take an umbrella to shade you from the intense sun as very little shade available, plus plenty of water; hire a guide (inexpensive) as they will cut you through all queues and bat away annoying selfie sticks when you are trying to get through crowds ( very busy with Chinese when we went). The guide gave a step by step history so you could look up whilst listening instead of reading from a leaflet - he also advised great photo spots from where to take best pictures. Be sure not to miss this temple and go as early as possible - a good couple of hours to do this site justice."

It consists of a group of very elaborate buildings, statues, and pagodas. The Ordination hall is a peaceful, majestic and beautifully decorated place. I am ashamed to say that I was so overawed by the building that I missed the tiny Buddha which sits high within the hall raised up on a series of platforms. It is carved from a single block of jade and is one of the most significant religious artefacts for the Thai people but it is very small compared to nearby buddhist statues.The tiny Buddha is covered in seasonal robes corresponding to the summer, winter, and rainy seasons. The ritual changing of these robes is performed only by the King of Thailand to bring continuing good fortune to the country. No other mortals are allowed near the statue.There are many other attractions on site including a model of Angkor Wat, which was built under the order of King Rama IV when Cambodia was under Siamese control. The Ramayana which considered to one of the great Hindu epics has been adapted and incorporated into Thai Buddhist tradition. Murals inside the balcony tell this story entirety and on the columns of the balcony are stone inscriptions of the verses describing the murals. Each gate of the Balcony is guarded by huge 5 metre tall gate-keeping giants called Yaksa Tavarnbal. These fearsome characters are taken from the same epic.To get the best from the temple arrive early and I recommend taking a guide or audio tour and remember that Temples are active and very sacred places. Remove your shoes and dress appropriately. Male and females should ensure that there is no exposed flesh between neck and knee. No shorts are allowed for either sex but trousers are available for hire if you have the correct money and can put up with the inefficient queues. Admission to the temple is 400 THB (\u00a38) for tourists and it closes at 15:30."

But imagine Bangkok in April, 35\u00b0C and hundreds of tourists without shoes sitting in the temple. Not very pleasant and calm. There are some locals that come to pray and show their respect but there is at least 10x more chinese tourists that try to take pictures and are noisy. It is beatiful and well maintained but that's just for making money off the tourists. It's not a temple with the purpose to praise Buddha and his teachings and it really never used to be, because before it was a money making machine it was exclusively build for the King and royal family to pray in."

He suggested a visit to the other temple over the other side of the river and started to lead the way to the river boat.

The Temples was ornate and beautiful and hundreds of people were visiting this special temple to see the Emerald Buddha. Of course, it is important to respect the local customs of taking off your shoes before entering the temple. It is my strong recommendation that you carry several plastic bags so you can put your shoes in a bag and carry it with you. For you never know, you may come out and find your shoes missing. It is good to be trusting, but why chance it. It is also important to be sure to get a guide before visiting the temple or purchase a small book to give you the historical context of the Temple and the significance of the Emerald Buddha. It is worth the crowds and time to visit the Emerald Buddha. Enjoy."

The temple was heaving with tourists, but don't let this put you off. To walk round the temple you should be wearing long trousers and your arms should be covered. However, don't panic if you are not dressed correctly - you can borrow long trousers and shirts from a loan facility near the entrance, where you pay a deposit to borrow appropriate clothing then you get your deposit back. Make sure your batteries are fully charged up in your phones and cameras, there are lots of photos to be taken"

The day we were there, the king was sick so the temple was actually closed to the public while the monks prayed for the king's health. All we could do was look through an open door and catch a glimpse of the buddha. I was surprised that it appeared golden, not green but found out that it is shrouded in a golden cloak. The temple itself is architecturally beautiful. It was actually a very solemn and spiritual experience as so many people were lighting candles and praying for the king."

The free maps are a great help for getting you round and there is plenty of security around. It's a bit of a free for all getting in as you'll have to use the 'foreigners' queue but it's worth the pushing. Make sure you cover your knees, although to be honest, they didn't seem that strict on it and a lot of people just loosely wore sarongs. The only downside? The sheer amount of selfie taking Japanese tourists. In every area you can't really see for the amount of cameras twisted into awkward positions to capture them doing the peace symbol with every Buddha!

If you don't have long clothes you can borrow for free (deposit of 200B) There are places where you can fill up your water bottle inside. I thought 500B was expensive and considering the crowd, they sure are making some serious money at this place. I was disappointed with seeing the Emerald Buddha as it is so far away from where you are allowed to stand and it was shrouded in its clothes of a gold cloak, I saw no green at all. Around the temple that houses the emerald Buddha are loads of other temples which mostly you are not allowed in to see but the outsides are very photographic and despite the crowds, there are some quiet areas that you can find to sit and rest in the shade. I found some of the gold, coloured glass and bright paint that covered all the buildings and statues a bit tacky but it was nice to see all the same. Take toilet roll or buy at the toilets."

The overwhelming crowd is something one has to contend with. Do note that one has to be properly dressed to gain entry to the palace. Men must wear long pants and shirts with sleeves. Women must be modestly dressed with the shoulders covered. However, there is a booth near the entrance that can provide clothes to cover you up properly. It is best to observe the dress code before gaining entry to the palace as the queue at the booth may be long or they may run out of clothes. Free guided tours in English are provided at pre-determined time slots. We decided to visit the Coin & Regalia museum while queuing up to enter the Temple of the Emerald Buddha. It was educational and a cool respite from the scorching heat. Bring along lots of water, a hat and a camera as this temple will offer you lots of photo opportunities."

A weekday is best, because the palace - which is included in the entrance fee - is closed at weekends, though it doesn't sound as important as the temple complex. Allow 1.5-2 hours for the temple complex - many stunning constructions and exotic statues and wall paintings to see as well as the temple of the emerald buddha - and then maybe 45 mins for the palace (I don't know, it was closed when we went.) DON'T be put off by anyone outside who may tell you that it is closed, or that you are wearing incorrect clothes. They just want to take you somewhere else where they will get a commission. This happens so often that they now have a loudspeaker outside telling you this. You have to wear clothing covering shoulders and knees, but they loan you a free coverup inside if you forget. Wear old shoes, as you have to leave them outside the door of the temple itself, though you can wear them around the temple complex. I've never had a pair stolen but mine are deliberately old. You can get an audio guide in several languages. The hire is for two hours, and it was very good and gave you a guided tour of the whole place. There is a cafe. There is a river boat stop (no 9?) very close and tourist river buses (40 baht) and public river buses (15 baht) go there. It's a nice cool way to travel."

Great for culture, but get there very early as it soon fills up with tourists and tour groups from cruise ships etc. plus it's very big with lots to see. Do not listen to anyone who tells you it is closed and tries to take you somewhere else, they are scamming you! we saw this so much right outside the entrance gate despite the loud speaker saying repeatedly not to ignore anyone telling you it's closed. Enter through gate three, keep walking till you find it, again ignoring many scammers.You must have your knees and shoulders covered, don't be an ignorant tourist and think you can get into a holy place without being respectful and dressing appropriatly! This is strictly enforced on both men as well as women. if you aren't covered up you will be refused entry until you rent trousers/shawl onsite by paying a deposit. It is definitely worth the visit, put aside at least three hours. Don't miss out the grand palace too."

Give it the respect it deserves and look for beauty everwhere - it takes a while to soak it all in. The Thai people are internationally known for being polite and friendly, so getting around is not difficult. Expect to pay a small entrance fee if you're not Thai - this happens at many places and is their way of taking care of their own. Most Thai are not rich and this is their heritage, so I think it's a good idea they can get in to their own temples for free.Also, a countrywide note about Buddhism, always treat Buddha with respect - you should never buy a Buddha or get one as a tattoo. Also, never make bad comments about the King or Queen, they are very loved by Thai people, you would be insulting their parents!"

The most important thing in this gigantic praying room is \"Emerald Buddha\" that Thai people believe that he can bring whatever you wish in a positive way to you and others. Emerald Buddha is unique in Thailand and he has three costumes in three seasons (summer, winter, rainy seasons). Another important thing is the Ramayana story that is beautifully painted on the wall around the palace (please study the Ramayana story before visiting the place and you will find it very interesting). You can also see the Himmapayana animal statues around the palace (e.g. Kinnaree - a half bird half woman creature, Singha - a lion, Garuda - a bird, etc.). These animals are believed to be the guardians of the palace as well as Vessuwan Giants - a God of demon. The statue of Guan-in or Guan-im Bothisattva is here. Some believe that he/she will become the future Buddha. Moreover, this is the place to commemorate the previous Kings' goodness and has the former Kings' ashes inside. There're so many details in this sacred place that I can't explain all in this space and every small details are meaningful. For example, the Garuda (bird) statue that holds Naga (snake) in hand has a long fighting legend, some pavilions named after the heavens (e.g. Dusit, etc.), the pagoda that has many Giants at the basement holding it is also in Thai legend, and so many more for you to discover.Before visiting, please check the ticket price at the Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT) online or at the official booths because there're many fake guides. Please respect the place and dress politely. There's the place to change your clothes if you dress improperly (I'm not sure whether you have to pay or deposit cash or not). The Grand Palace is the main tourist attraction so there're many tourists all year round."

I would suggest you go in the AM, as the afternoon heat, along with crowds can make for an unpleasant visit. Taking the tour on your own is very possible as once you get your ticket and proceed into the Temple yard you can sign up for a free English and other language tour given by one of their guides at no cost.

First off, when dropped off by a taxi driver, don't expect to get dropped off right at the entrance- they get in trouble for that (as my taxi driver apparently discovered). Also, when you get to the entrance, there will be many toots wearing official looking badges and saying something about tickets, and the palace being closed, and trying to escort you somewhere else. Ignore them, they aren't official and they probably are trying to cheat you, but the police will do nothing about them other than posting signs giving you the same advice. 500 Baht gets you a ticket to see the Emerald Buddha and Grand Palace complex, plus free entry into the coin and jewelry antiquities museum (which I felt was small but well done). The Emerald Buddha is impressive to your eye in spite of its small stature and distance, but the guards are very brusque about trying to move people through and if you take a picture (which you aren't supposed to), they will strong arm you into deleting it while they watch. As a result, what has the potential to be an impressive memory becomes damaged by the rush of it all.The buildings, though, set in multiple styles, are a treat to the architecturally inclined. But because the buildings are intended for the use by the Thai king and his family, entry into most of the buildings is either impossible or limited to a few special occasions a year. Surrounding the entire complex is a covered walkway with, I think 700+ murals describing the life of Buddha, but I didn't find them particularly enlightening. If you can be there just before 10 or 10:30 am, or 1 or 1:30, there are guided tours done in heavily Thai accented English (which I had no problems with, but some in our group were more aurally challenged). The tour is very informative and covers both parts of the entire complex, but with a catch: once you move over to the Grand Palace, you will not be allowed to return to the Emerald Buddha, so make sure you saw your fill before you take the tour.When taking your picture with the demons and monkeys, please remember to stand with the monkeys if you want to get more intelligence and with the demons if you want more power!My biggest disappointment is that they don't make it possible to stand above the scale model of Angkor Wat that is on the grounds. Only being able to view it from the side is not very worthwhile."

According to legend the Emerald Buddha statue originated in India, however other legends claimm it was originally from first vassal Kingdom of Cambodia. The image disappeared when Burmese raiders sacked Ayuttaya also spelt \"Ayudaya\" and the image was feared lost.[1]Statue of a kinnara in Wat Phra Kaew, Bangkok (Thailand).Continuing with the legend of the saint Nagasena of India, after remaining in Pataliputra (present day Patna) for three hundred years, the Emerald Buddha image was taken to Sri Lanka to save it from a civil war. In 457, King Anuruth of Burma sent a mission to Ceylon with a request for Buddhist scriptures and the Emerald Buddha, in order to promote Buddhism in his country. These requests were granted, but the ship lost its way in a storm during the return voyage and landed in Cambodia. When the Thais captured Angkor Wat in 1432 (following the ravage of the bubonic plague), the Emerald Buddha was taken to Ayutthaya, Kamphaeng Phet, Laos and finally Chiang Rai, where the ruler of the city hid it. Cambodian historians recorded capture of the Buddha statue in their famous Preah Ko Preah Keo legend"

The tour groups are a-plenty and we were very disappointed that they had very little respect for the sanctity of the Temple as they spoke loudly and shouted at one another. Almost all of them! This included the tour operators. They also had even less respect for other tourists as they pushed and shoved their way around to get to the front of the line at all the entrances and the better view for a good camera shot. Very annoying! Being half Asian, I was embarassed by them. I almost wished that the authorities would limit the number of large tour groups at any given time and give priority to other smaller numbers or single tourists. In any case, this is a must visit when one is in Bangkok. Be sure to wear long pants and sleeved t-shirts (no sleeveless). Lest you want to queue to get a loaned sarong / shirt!"

One of the star attractions in Bangkok is the the beautiful Emerald Buddha located in the Grand Palace complex.The Buddha image is not very large and is covered in a gold coat the changes depending on whether it's summer or winter.To pay your respect to the Buddha you will need, like all other temples to remove your shoes before entering the buildings. No photography is allowed inside. As the most revered Buddha image, Thai's visit to pray so you will need to respect them. It gets extremely busy with crowds throughout the day so it's best to get there early."

The ostentatious exterior of the temple makes you wonder at the amount of wealth that has gone in to its creation. And then you enter the 'sanctum' where you find the emerald buddha right at the pinnacle. There was a replica of the Angkor Wat Temple in Cambodia that we saw here and the detailing was superb! There is a dress code in place here. Shorts, short dresses or skirts, sleeveless shirts/tops, tights, jeggings and the like are prohibited. If you do make the mistake of wearing something like that, appropriate clothing is available within the premises for a refundable amount. But we witnessed several people who were in violation of the dress code walking around freely which was unnerving. The entrance fee we thought was exorbitant and no amount of walking around or exploring gave us the feeling that we got our money's worth!

If you are pulled out of line you can either buy clothes at the little shop right there, or return to the main entry of the Palace grounds to borrow free clothing.

Especially important if you plan on taking pictures and don't want people walking through your shot every three seconds. 2) unless you've done your research I would suggest renting the audio guide for 200baht. I didn't and had no I dea what I was looking at. You'll need a credit card or original passport to hand in, copies and drivers licence don't cut it. Also, if you're staying down on Khao San Road, don't take a tuk tuk there is absoutely no need. Just walk over to the busy highway a block over from KSR, cross at the cross walk with the giant elephant statue, hang a right and take the first street. You will probably see buses already and loads of tourists walking in the right direction. The walk shouldn't take longer than 15 minutes tops. Saves you the hassle of tuk tuk drivers. And regardless of what they say, it IS open, 8:30 am."

The temple is just like any other Thai Buddhist temple, unless you are really keen on seeing a Jade statue you can skip this reason being the Buddha is kept in a hall surrounded by lot of other things like offerings and nearly 20+ ft above ground level, so you can only appriciate the existence of Jade Statue but can not enjoy the details."

Two distinct aspects will contribute to your experience in that Temp,\u00c9: the beauty of the building, and it's religious meaning to the Buddhist. In the first feature, you will see a very impressive assemble of mosaics, mother of pearls, statuary, all these in the external area. Inside, you'll have the Emerald Budha.A little word of advice - it is a very small statue, that os in a very high place - so you will hardly see it. But the chamber in which it is located is richly painted. There are also statues and other ornaments near by the Budha. The people inside, bringing offerings and saying prayers is some sort of attraction itself. It is kind of difficult to get inside - the Temple is crowded, and the stairs are full with people. it is a.so very hot inside. The visit inside is necessarily short - crowd + heat usually have that effect in people, but it is still worthy. And the outside, which is beautiful, do not suffer from the same limitations, so you can take your time.Always remember, the dress code totally applies, and people are very restrict about it."

Wat Phra Kaew or the Temple of the Emerald Buddha has all the treasures accumulated in one temple next to the Royal Palace. Normally whether it is an independent visit or a guided tour, the two important attractions are combined as one sightseeing tour. Many visitors were confused with the different areas visited whether it was in the temple or the palace. Therefore as a simple rule, anythings that were allow to be photographed are likely to be in the temple ground. Simply take a look at the photos taken in the Emerald Buddha Temple in the TripAdvisor and that can give you the sights not to be missed."

Also, if you have a private guide, who is good as Am was for us, she avoided the lines and crowds, and deftly guided us through this attraction like a local. This added so much to the experience to not have to stand in lines or be bulked up with huge crowds.TIPS: Be ready for a hot day and be hydrated. Also, as with any temple, dress with LONG pants and no breasts showing for women. If you have on shorts, the temple will provide clothing for the visit, but wearing long, light clothes also works. As for hydration, if you have an amazing local guide like Am, she will provide you will cold drinks for your visit. Stay hydrated during the visit."

I would start with the Emerald Buddha and palace grounds. While it is small, and raised on a pedestal, its religious significance can not be denied. I was here in the late morning and this seems to be the peak time for tour groups. I noticed that the crowds were much lower at the entrance when I was leaving, suggesting that early afternoons will be much less crowded. There is easy access to the palace via the water bus system. Just beware of the Tourist Police (in uniform) who will tell you the palace is closed and redirect you to a Tuk Tuk driver who will then take you on \"tour\" and shopping trip (for 40 Baht I actually had an enjoyable tour but do not fall victim to the shops they take you to)."

The one unpleasant aspect was that the floor was somewhat sticky/smelly. No pix but crowd flowed in and out nicelyThere is a museum nearby with the Buddha's other seasonal garb (all gold)....The summer outfit seemed the most dramatic. (you apparently need a pink slip to get in...it's right near the Nepalese gift stand on the way in....I didn't have the pink ticket, but showed the guard all the others I had, and they laughed and let me in~ It was well worth the visit)."

I should preface my review with this disclaimer: I visited Wat Pho and Wat Traimit the day before and I am completely \"templed\" out. That, and then they asked me to wear a sarong over my leggings (even though I was wearing a long shirt, with sleeves, that covered my bottom, which was perfectly acceptable at BOTH temples yesterday) I was completely over it. I would not have even gone into the palace/temple if we hadn't already paid for admission in advance through our tour group. I should also note I am completely over Bangkok to the point where the only thing that recommends a visit is the exchange rate, unless you need clothing tailor-made or you happen to enjoy visiting large urban cities with mass poverty. Seriously, if this place is a \"bucket-list\" place for you, spend two days max, do a bike tour to hit highlights and then get out. That off my chest, the temple was pretty but not nearly as impressive as anything in Europe. It is only around 200 years old at the maximum. So you spend hours looking at temple that looks like all the others (as if someone built spires/buildings out of tile and then went crazy with glitter and mirror pieces). And then they show you some two-dimensional murals and we are supposed to be impressed? No thanks. I recommend you pick one or if you have to do them all, run through it to say you did it and then go get lunch."

Catch the subway to Saphan Taksim station ( central pier) and take the boat from, you don't have to pay anything until on board. Don't go to ticket counter they will charge you 42 Bachts. It's very easy and simple you just need a detailed map from the hotel and patience. Most of Thai ppl don't speak English. Having said that, once you arrive at the GrandPalace stop which is pier N9. For men no shorts and women shoulders and legs must be covered. Don't worry they provide pants and shawls at the door in case. The Palace visit should take half of day if not the whole day, so plan accordingly, do buy some food or fruits from the stalls outside the pier, I.

The Emerald Buddha has to be high on your to do list when visiting Bangkok. The Buddha is inside the Wat Phra Kaew Temple which itself is inside and on the grounds of The Grand Palace. Once inside the grounds, just look for signs to guide you to the Emerald Buddha. There are racks to store your footware, which is not allowed inside the temple. Wear old or dark socks. Once inside you may do like many and glance around looking for some large life size figure. Just look straight ahead and up as high as you can look, because the Emerald Buddha is a small figure nestled high up off the ground and behind roped off guarded space. For its small size it is a magnificent sight. Carved from a single piece of jade, it represents the most important symbol of Thailand. Buddha has 3 change of clothing for the 3 primary seasons of Thailand and the royalty takes part in the tri year ceremony to change buddha's clothing. The Buddha and the temple are spectacularly decorated with vivid colors and designs representative of Buddhism and its culture. Will not go on with the history, you can certainly read up on it yourself, but just say, do not miss this site. Also proper dress required inside the palace grounds, long pants for men, and some sort of sleeve shirt. No tank tops, shoulders showing, flip flops. Etc. Thai double standard applies here, 500 baht entrance fee for foreigners, 100 for locals."

All of the temples require you to be fully covered up and if you have jeans it can get uncomfortable.Also buy the coins and think about what you want as you drop the coins into the pails. The monks then take this to buy food as I understand it."

Don't wear short shorts or short skirts. If you do, take a sarong or wrap to cover up. Take water as it will get very very hot. Be prepared for huge crowds when you get off the boat, it's just crazy. Really wish I had gone early in the morning. If you take a tuk tuk, specifically as for sathorn pier. If you just say 'river', they will take you to one of their friend's river tours, which could cost upwards of 1500 baht/person.

Opulent and beautiful.Admission is a very steep 500 baht, but worth it if you've never been here before. It was my 5 th visit and I do not begrudge the fee which helps to maintain these magnificent edifices. Admission includes the grand palace and the Villamook palace which is in another location but well worth visiting.Be WARNED, they strictly enforce their dress code, no sleeveless attire for women, modest tops and no short skirts. Men and women can not wear shorts or 3/4 length pants. You can \"borrow\" suitable attire from the building immediately to your right when you enter the main exterior gate.

Here you will be inspected for appropriate dress and sent back if you don't comply. The ticket lines go quickly - don't be daunted. My breath was taken away as soon as I stepped into this compound. Whereas Wat Pho looked like a garden of temples, this compound was chock a block with colorful, golden and mirrored buildings one against another, all the hallways decorated with murals and tiles and small statuettes, the pathways filled with people, all moving smoothly and easily together. Again, getting in to see the Emerald Buddha was easy and smooth despite the crowds. I was thrilled (who knows why...) at seeing that his clothes had been ceremoniously changed for the new season. My husband waited outside (one temple was enough for him) and we arranged to meet a half an hour later at the 'first' exit, which is right by the ticket line. I found it by following the general route of the tours and guides, otherwise, the place could be a maze of gates and passageways.

There is a free tour that goes every half hour, only lasts an hour, but will help you get so much more out of the sights than if you were just to walk around yourself. And IT IS AMAZING! So ornate and there is so much history. Every angle is a different view of unsurpassed beauty. The gold is so bright!The emerald Buddha is really only a miniscule part of what Wat Phra Kaew has to offer with most of the other buildings having more history associated to them and a ton more impressive. You do need to be sure to have your legs and arms covered and there are free pants (men), serongs (women), and scarves (women) for those who did not dress properly. Since it is soooo hot, I was not about to wear long sleeves/pants the whole day so I opted for this service as did many others and the clothes were clean and quality. Flip flops and sandles appeared to be permissable."

The Palace was closed at this time for a ceremony. Therefore, there were A LOT of people there. My boyfriend had been here before and he said it was busy.. but nothing like we experienced. At first you could barely move.. there were so many people. This was our last day in Bangkok and the temple was free (I've heard people mention it cost them money, so I'm not sure if it was just free this day?) Anyway, we decided to go in to see if it was any less packed once we got past the entrance. It was not. Never-the-less, to our benefit a massive storm came in. We hid out in one of the temples until it passed. It took awhile to wait it out, but when we emerged the place had emptied out quite a bit. This was my first wat visit, but I thought it was extraordinary. The emerald Buddha is very small, but very interesting. I loved walking around the outer perimeter looking at the murals and the stories they depicted. Since we hung out here for so long to avoid the storm, we were around as the sun started to go down. I love being at wats at this time, as it is very interesting to sit and observe the monks chanting. Also I think this is one of the best times at the wat in terms of number of tourists. By the time we were leaving there was next to no one here. Consequently, it was a lot easier to take photos and not have a crowd of people ruining them and your experience."

Take your shoes off before entering the shrine area.Be aware of the touts outside the temple, most are just trying to make a living, but it can be annoying and frustrating. Walk along a bit to try to get a taxi, with luck you will eventually find one that uses the meter.The cost is 500 baht (about 10 pounds), which doesn't seem a lot for a tourist, but Thais get in for free, whether they are there to worship or not.

Dress code is the same as in other royal properties, cover your knees and shoulders. Sarong is available for rent but you may want to skip the queue. Local style long pants are available for sale (200B) opposite the main entrance.If you are a bit adventurous go to Sanam Luang and hop on bus number 15. The bus will pass some old buildings, including a fort and many temples. Just press the button when you want to get off and continue your ride with the next bus. It will eventually take you to MBK and Siam. Depending on the bus, you might get free bus or have to pay 6.5 baht each person, flat fare. Cheap but most of them are old buses with no aircon."

Only much later was the plaster accidentally cracked and the emerald was seen.Make sure not to point your feet at the buddha as a sign of respect."

This was my second time at Wat Phra Kaew and can clearly say now that even though this place is absolutely beautiful, there are other temples that take the cake over that one. The architecture and grandiose of this area is not questionable but there are way too many people there every day and very hard to get the picture you want. Of course it is impossible to visit Bangkok without visiting this iconic area, but it is almost $20 USD per person and you have to be covered from head to toe if you want to go in. No ripped jeans, no short blouses for women either. You must have long pants and cover as much as you can on top as well especially if you are a woman. They are very strict on dress code there and will turn you around if they do not see fit.Overall, a must see in Bangkok but with a bigger admission price and definitely a lot of sweating along the way."

I think I was more impressed with the building than the Emerald Buddha. I thought it was going to be bigger than it was. But I don't want to take away it's sheer beauty. It is stunning but I only wish you could get closer. You have to wait your turn to take photos but with a good lens you can get reasonably decent photos. It's quite amazing to think how old it is.Well worth a visit."

Although the temple was full to overflowing as were the entire grounds of the Grand Palace with thousands of noisy, rude, pushy and disrespectful Chinese tour groups the workmanship that has gone into this building is amazing. Very difficult to get a good look at the Buddha and the surroundings due to the absolute crush of people, however the building itself is breathtaking. No photos allowed which I totally respect, this is after all a religious site. The floor is made of inlaid marble of several different colours in a very intricate pattern. I only wished my son-in-law who is a stone mason could have seen it. He would have been awestruck. As with the entire grand Palace precinct, I believe it needs to have some restrictions put on visitor numbers. A higher entry that includes a guide and maybe even a pre-booking system for non Thais would lead to a much more enjoyable experience."

Wat Phra Kaew is regarded as the most important Buddhist Temple in Thailand and is located within the grounds of the Grand Palace complex. We were there in mid-December and it was really crowded.Once we walked past the main gate of the Grand Palace complex occupied by an army \u201ccheckpoint\u201d, we could see the Temple Complex to the left across the open field.Past the Temple entrance, the first attraction on the site is a statue of the \u201chermit doctor\u201d who is supposed to have healing powers. Directly behind the hermit doctor statue is Wat Phra Kaew.In the same area around, the hermit doctor, we encountered the imposing 5 metre tall (16 feet) guards for the temple complex towering over the tourists. These guardians of the gate called Yakshis are common throughout the temples in the country.Once you\u2019re at the Temple, you\u2019ll notice the decorations on the outside of the temple wall. The walls of the bot (ordination hall) have 112 golden garudas - mythical bird like creatures with a humanoid form.The Emerald Buddha is carved from a single block of jade and is around 66 centimetres (26 inches) in height. The Emerald Buddha is relatively small, is also elevated on a pedestal and is cordoned off. As a result you cannot get close enough to get a really good look. It might be a good idea to bring a pair of binoculars.The Emerald Buddha has three changes of robes each year corresponding to the three seasons - the summer \u2013 diamond encrusted gold robe, winter - solid gold robe and the rainy season \u2013 a gilded monk\u2019s robe. No one is allowed near or to touch the Emerald Buddha except the King of Thailand. That being the case, the King performs the changing of the robe ceremony during each season to bring good fortune.Before you enter the temple you will have to remove your shoes and NO photography is allowed inside. A tourist took some photos inside and security quickly came and confiscated the camera. I don\u2019t know what happened to the tourist and the camera.Our group spent at most 30 minutes at the actual temple.Before and after the visit of the Emerald Buddha, we walked through the Temple grounds. On the grounds you will be able to see many monuments, structures and statues including the following:\u2022 Gold coloured statues of kinnara (male) and kinnaris (female) - a half human, half bird creature.\u2022 Phra Mondhop \u2013 library next to Phra Si Rattana Chedi\u2022 Phra Si Rattana Chedi - a gold coloured, bell shaped structure with a spire \u2013 a place for prayer\u2022 Phra Chedi Thong (The Twin Golden Stupas) \u2013 demons and monkeys \u201cholding up\u201d the stupa (prayer mound).\u2022 Close to the Temple, you\u2019ll also see a model of Angkor Wat \u2013 a famous 12th century temple in Cambodia. From what I have read, the King Rama IV started the model project and the King Rama V completed this model to celebrate the centennial of Bangkok as the Royal City and show Thailand\u2019s early history of owning what is now called Cambodia.We spent somewhere around 90 minutes visiting the complex; anything less and you would be doing a disservice to yourself. I probably could have spent at least another 30-60 minutes at the site.The architecture of the various buildings and the many mythical statues within the Temple complex are spectacular in my opinion because of its beauty, symbolism and the uniqueness. One could argue the architecture and the mythical creature statues were much more interesting than the actual Emerald Buddha. If there was a separate rating / review for the Wat Phra Kaew complex (not including the Temple) I would give it a higher rating of 4+ out of 5.In my opinion, the Emerald Buddha is interesting but the Reclining Buddha at Wat Pho is more impressive. Although, I will say the Temple housing the Emerald Buddha is quite nice. I would rate the Emerald Buddha site as just average; at most 3+ out 5.Notes and Tips\u2022 When you pay your entrance fee, be sure to pick up a map of the Grand Palace complex.\u2022 There are no monks resident in this temple complex unlike the many other temples.\u2022 We were quite prepared in terms of what clothes to wear and not to wear so we did have any issues entering the Grand Palace grounds. If your clothing is deemed inappropriate, you can rent clothes for a nominal fee (refundable deposit) at the front gate or another option is to buy some clothes from street vendors.\u2022 There are 12 Yakshis with a pair standing at each of the 6 gates to the Temple complex. Each of them has a different name. In addition to the 12 guarding the gates, there are more inside the complex. There are 4 more pairs guarding each of the four entrances at Phra Mondop (library).\u2022 If you\u2019re into photography, in my opinion, a 200 mm telephoto lens (slr camera) would be the minimum to get an average close up of the Emerald Buddha. If you have a regular digital camera like many people; one with 20x or 30x optical zoom (not digital zoom) would be ideal.\u2022 Like Wat Pho \u2013 Temple of the Reclining Buddha, there is more to Wat Phra Kaew than the temple. There are lots of interesting structures.\u2022 The Grand Palace complex sits adjacent to the Wat Pho complex. It is approximately 1 kilometre (6/10th of mile) to the entrance.\u2022 This was day 2 of 3 of our Bangkok tour through Wandee Tours. Our tour guide Wandee spoke fairly good English; good enough for us to understand.\u2022 Days 1 and 3 included tours of the Jim Thompson House, the Golden Buddha, Chinatown, the Flower Market, the train market, a canal boat tour and the floating market.\u2022 Our ship the Azamara Journey has a capacity of 694 passengers and because it is a smaller ship, it can dock \u201cdowntown\u201d. The larger ships dock farther away resulting in longer transportation times to the downtown core.\u2022 The first thing I noticed while I was on the bus was the amount of traffic on the roads. Regardless of the time of day it appeared that \u201crush hour\u201d was all day and evening. Furthermore, the shoulder of the road becomes an \u201cextra\u201d lane."

However, to be perfectly honest I was a bit disappointed with the inside of the building. The Buddha is a teeny tiny little thing. There were so many people inside the temple trying to look at him, and that combined with the extreme heat made the experience was draining for me. Never the less, even if you only see the outside of the temple it is still worth visiting. Plus, the combination of the other beautiful temples in the complex makes it worth while. As a side note, my husband and I are Christians so perhaps that is why we did not enjoy the temple quite as much as others have. Other helpful information: -There is a fee to get inside the palace grounds, but no extra fees to see the temple. -Bring a bottle of water, or two! We were there in the middle of summer and became very dehydrated. The water outside the palace is over priced because everyone needs it so badly. -There are lots of steps everywhere you go with no wheel chair access. Be prepared for that if have problems with mobility.-This is not really a place for children. Although this a great place for looking at beautiful architecture, it is something small children would find boring."

There are guides available who speak English but I preferred to simply find my own way, at my pace, and not join a tour. Whilst avoiding using a guide I might have missed out on interesting facts, what I came for could not be missed. The breathtaking spend our of Wat Phra Kaerw cannot be overstated (though that may be a personal opinion not shared by all). The attraction is only opened for entry until 3.30pm so don't leave it late in the day to visit or you may be disappointed in not seeing as much as you would have liked. Entrance for foreigners is 500baht but that get you full access. Expect to pay to \"spend a penny\" and also make sure that you dress respectfully or you simply will not be allowed entry. If you go early enough in the day on the water bus like I did it is also possible to take in Wat Arun which lies one stop down river on the opposite bank (free entry if I remember from my last visit)."

A complete visit of the Grand Palace and Wat Phra Kaew is certainly highly recommended for all visitors to Thailand.Wat Phra Kaew can be a very serene and peaceful place. But it's definitely best to visit at non-peak hours (avoid from mid-morning till early afternoon) to avoid the tourist mobs and noise. The emerald Buddha itself (the source of all the hype around Wat Phra Kaew) is somewhat under-whelming in my opinion.

There are con/scam artists that sit out in front of the gates. Some claim to be police or security. They will be happy to tell you that no shorts are allowed and you can pay them for a tour, and a boat tour, etc. Ignore them but be polite. Once you enter the temple, yes, you cannot wear shorts. If you made this transgression, you rent long baggy pants. In May, in the unforgiving heat, I was impressed at how much sweat my legs could produce.Recommendation: We stayed at the Doubletree Sukhomvit - you can leave the temple, walk 5 mins and catch the river taxi. i even had tine for a super cold beer. Take a 15 min awesome ride up a depressingly polluted river and catch the skytrain back to Sukhomvit."

Both temple and Buddha image are exquisitely beautiful. Go to the museum first and you can see the seasonal changes of clothing for the emerald green jade Buddha image, all in fine gold work. You can also watch a very short film of the King in his younger days performing the change of clothing ceremony. You need to prepare yourself properly: as always in Thai temples, show respect - long trousers for men and no bare arms for ladies.. Read a good guide book and be prepared to be patient. Reading other reviews makes it clear there are issues some difficult days and on the day we went a 10 minute wait was needed as a group of dignitaries passed through. But they do seem to mange the numbers inside quite well. You can't take photos inside but there are numerous photo opportunities if you study the beautifully decorated exterior, for example, if you stand at the front door end and look down the side colonnade to the right. I was not aware that our guide paid any charge here other than the original Grand Palace entry charge. As I said, you need a bit of patience and it is also worth noting the obvious reverence of the locals. It is not only a question of what it looks like, you need to try to grasp what it means to people from that culture."

My travel companion arrived there wearing long trousers, sleeveless top and a shawl as cover up, but she was still requested to 'cover' her shoulders. Clothes rental is available at the entrance for 200 baht. Save yourself from the hassle though. Also, I think it is best to wear sandals or slip ons, as there are places in the palace wherein you won't be allowed to enter unless you take off your shoes. Outside the temple, there will be cons who will approach tourists and travellers, saying that the temple will close earlier, and that he knows which entrance to go and will offer to guide you instead. Don't fall for this - they dress up like professionals and can pass for an accredited tourist guide. They will charge you more and will cheat you to go somewhere else.Entrance fee at the Grand Palace and Wat Phra Kaew is 500 baht per person. It's usually very crowded. Once inside, prepare to be amazed with the structures and the intricate beauty of the temples. Don't miss to enter the temple of the Emerald Buddha. It's amazing.You also have the option to visit Queen Sirikit Museum. They have a separate entrance fee for this, but this is something that you should not miss while you're there at the Grand Palace. - Bring an umbrella or a hat, it can get very hot especially when you're visiting around 1:00pm to 2:00pm.- Take a bottle of water with you. The area is quite massive and the walk trip might exhaust you. It's good to be prepared, as some vendors outside the palace will try to charge you more than half the price of their bottled water."

When visiting the Buddha you need to remove your shoes and wait respectfully in the line. You can purchase offering there if you want to make a Buddhist offering. This place is a must, if you're in Bangkok. Don't forget your camera and take your time. It's really a place worth exploring and take in the atmosphere. Even after seeing many beautiful temples it's still one of my favorites in the country. There is a coffee souvenir shop if you can find it, it has some very cheap good quality book on the place and temple."

I suggest to sit down on the floor, even if you are not a Buddhist or believer of anything, to enable you to explore all the small details, and there is all the time more and more. An uplifting experience and a visit is 'obligatory' so if you do nothing else in Bangkok, I recommend a visit to Wat Phra Kaew, and look for the green on Buddha statue in the sea of all gold."

This is the most famous place that is a must visit for Thailand trip for sure. It is a large compound located near Sanam Luang in the very heart of Bangkok. The Grand Palace and the Temple of the Emerald Buddha are Magnificent with several buildings in different styles of architecture with gold accented and attention to every details with used of jewels that sparkles everywhere you looked. There are so elegant and gorgeous buildings.The grounds also are covered with interesting sculpture of animals in mythology that are very beautiful and well maintained. Inside the Emerald Temple is unbelievable beautiful, there are extensive mural paintings depicting scenes from the famous epic \"Ramayana\". It is the longest wall painting in the Thailand. In the center and up high is the most highly revered Buddha carved from a single block of find Jade which is pretty tiny that you won't be able to see any detail at all( NO picture taking and should respect that). Beside being such a tiny Buddha and sitting up high, he also cover in outfit and I believed they have a ceremony changing the outfit for the Emerald Buddha 4 times a year(Spring, Summer, Fall and Winter). Even that NO ONE can take pictures and this including Thais. A distinctive characteristic of this temple is that there are NO monks living in this temple like any other temples in Thailand.Emerald Temple is GORGEOUS Temple and the most important temple in Thailand. Visitors are requested to be dressed properly and appropriately upon entering the ground of the Grand Palace. And we tourist should totally respected that( I had read a lot of complaint about how hot it is to have to wear a certain cloths or shoe that expecting us to do. I think we need to learn to adopt to Thai culture when we come to Thailand period. If we are going to a Muslims Country which would definitely have more severe punishment, would you respect their cultures? So please stop complaining about the dress codes for Temples in Thailand, and show some respect for the place and people here.It opens at 8:30 am to 3:30 pm every single day. The early you come, the mostly likely you can get in without waiting in line and less crowded it is. There is wet frozen towel for you to buy and it helps for 30 BTH and it last for a couple hours. The fee to get in is 500 BTH but it worth it. NO other Temple is this beautiful. I love it and revisiting quite often with friends from all over the world."

The Emerald Buddha is impressive but very small! Another beautiful building is the Mondop (library) - can't go inside but worth walking around the exterior. Next to it is a small reproduction of Angkor Wat, worth a look if you've seen the real thing or are going to see the real thing. And do not miss the beautiful wall paintings in the Ramakien Gallery. If you are short of time and can't visit both the Wat and the Grand Palace, I'd visit the wat or spend more time there. The Palace is pretty but not as interesting as the wat."

            "review": "Scam day at the Temple. What a shame such a wonderful tourist attraction is tainted by a total lack of regulation of street scamsters! This is one of the world's great attractions, but yet we had a very ordinary experience which ruined what should have been a great day. From Sapphin Taksin station we walked to the river where we were conned into a river boat ride to the temple at 150 bht when we thought we were getting on the public ferry which is just 15 bht. Then had to pay a 50 bht \"landing fee\" to a beefed up tough guy on the dock at the temple end. From the dock we walked up the road and were ushered across to an entrance to the palace about 11am where we halted at a gate by an official looking guy and an apparent palace soldier in uniform and hold we could not enter. They said the Palace closed on Monday until 2pm and suggested we could fill the time by visiting a couple of local temples in a tuk tuk for 40 bht round trip. Also today we were sooo lucky because \"this is the one week of the year when the wholesale export outlets are open to the public\" so they would take us there for a look. Sadly we agreed not realising at first that this was a scam. The first temple actually wasn't too bad but at the second temple which was very ordinary we found ourselves in conversation with a tall thin young Asian man with good English and excellent knowledge of Australian culture who informed us that he was on his 7th trip from his home country of Singapore. He took the opportunity to also restate how lucky we were that this was a really good week to be checking out the export outlets. Our suspicions were immediately raised. We were then escorted around 3 or 4 export outlets with the highest pressure salespeople I've ever seen at Chinese and Indian trading houses where they pushed hard to get us to buy jewellery and suits. By 1pm we had had enough and asked to be taken back to the Palace, but our tuk tuk driver insisted on one last stop which was a travel agency. When the girl at the travel agency asked us where we would like to go she was quite shocked when I said we were not interested in booking anything and promptly escorted us to the door. When we finally returned to the Palace about 1.30 we were annoyed to find it had been open since 8:30. Needless to say - not impressed.We were picked up by a guide for a guided tour at the correct main gate. He claimed to be a retired Royal Guard. He seemed authentic and did give us an informative tour of the site, although our concerns were raised when near the end of the tour when he seemed quite happy to pass us back to a couple of high pressure people selling canal cruises at 1600 bht. Needless to say we passed on that idea and chose to find another way home. We would regard ourselves as quite experienced travellers and have never been so blatantly scammed anywhere else in the world. I hope this serves as a warning to other travellers to cultural sites in BKK."

If they are less than 120 cm, which cannot happen with regular western kids of 6 and older. They force you to dress like a monk if you wear shorts or short sleeves, with pants and sarongs they lend you (another 500B deposit, but you get it back when out). I mean, this is crazy, my daughters had shorts to the knee, and shoulders covered. We're in BKK, come on, it's 38\u00b0C out there! All this for so-called buddhist thing. Well, monks are supposed, according to buddhism, to carry only vital items, nothing fancy, right? So why do they wander around with tablets, cell phones, and leather briefcases? I can't accept that an iPhone owner wearing an orange dress and no hair on skull forces my daughters to wear a thick dress from neck to toes by such temperatures.Anyways, back to the temple itself. Yep, that's interesting. Emerald Buddha can be seen only if you have a 400 mm lens at f/2 (in this case, you won't bother with the entrance fee!) or a good telescope. Tiny little thing on a very high pedestal. Temples you can't photograph, all red and gold. Packed with people. Unfriendly staff. Take your 2000 B you would have spent for family visit and get a nice book about emerald buddha and grand palace.And if you still want to go there: beware of all scammers out there, telling you the temple is closed, or any othe BS. All they say is untrue. And when back, walk for at least half a km before you can find honest taxi or tuktuk."

He proposed a boat cruise and found Tuk-tuks to transport us.

The rides are fun, but if you just want to get to the Grand Palace, then ask at the public Information booth to make sure you're in the right place. The ferry costs 20 baht. When you get off the ferry, you'll walk through a market. Best to wait until you return to buy anything. Things are a little less expensive the further you get from the ferry. People will tell you that the palace and temple are closed or are opening late.

First the bad part - The moment you drop off from a taxi onto the walls of the temple and grand palace, you will lose your orientation and will not be able to recognise which is the main entrance. Locals get in free from all exits, but foreigners have to get a ticket from only one entrance. Anyone else that comes up to you, however friendly or with a \"tourist guide\" badge, or tells you that it is closed today for prayers and recommends elsewhere, is a scammer and you should just smile and walk away. That said, the entrance is basically near to a traffic light crossing where the opposite is a row of shops consisting of cafes, etc. There is a ticket booth there as well as a dress code where you have to borrow scarfs to cover up if you are not properly dressed. The interiors are amazingly well maintained, and the gilded gold images on the walls tell of the epic battles and legends from Ramayana. The Emerald Buddha is also a wonderful sight to visit, and the building that houses it is also intricately designed and constructed. This place is well worth the price to visit."

It is pretty cool but you can't take its picture from inside the temple, where you can go to see it much closer up. Pictures must be taken from outside, which is where I took mine (long zoom capabilities on my camera). Worth seeing but it only takes a few minutes. The Grand Palace grounds, themselves, are what will take up most of your trip here."

The Highlight of your visit to the Grand Palace is Wat Phra Kaew (Temple of the Emerald Buddha), which is considered to be the sacred Buddhist temple in Thailand and the location where you can see the famous Emerald Buddha. The temple is found at the Upper Terrace of the Grand Palace and is a highly decorative building, featuring Rattanakosin (old Bangkok) style architecture, immaculate exterior carvings, pillars and design, lovely interior wall murals as well as the sacred Emerald Buddha, which was discovered in 1434 in a stupa in Chiang Rai. Beyond its discovery, Its origins are unknown. The Buddha image is enshrined in a throne case, it is covered in one of three seasonal costumes and situated in the main ordination hall for all to see. Of interesting note, when viewing the Emerald Buddha, you'll probably notice that it doesn't appear to be made of emerald. This is because it is actually carved out of green jade instead. The name was given by the monk who originally found the object and mistakenly thought the Buddha was of emerald stone. After visiting the Temple of the Emerald Buddha, it is well worth seeing the other interesting attractions at the Upper Terrace including the Phra Siratani Chedi, a 19th-century, Sri Lankan style stupa building with is believed to hold ashes of the Lord Buddha. You can also see the important Phra Mondop building, which holds historic Buddhist scriptures that are inscribed on palm leaves which are contained within a decorative, mother-of-pearl inlaid cabinet. There is also a sandstone model of Angkor Wat (circa 1860), which was commissioned when Thailand ruled over this modern day Cambodian World Heritage Sight. You can also find, many decorative statues, elephants and other nice images spread around the Upper Terrace. These are all lovely to see before or after you experience the Temple of the Emerald Buddha. In the end, if there is only one thing you are going to see during your visit to the Grand Palace, it should be the Temple of the Emerald Buddha. You can stay there for as little as 5 minutes or you can spend as much time as you like inside the ordination hall, viewing this sacred Buddha. Then you can visit other areas of the Grand Palace. Tip: Photography isn't allowed within the Ordination Hall that houses the Emerald Buddha. Tip: You must remove your shoes prior to entering the temple. There are plenty of racks available for you store you shoes located just before the entrance."

The paintings on the walls are superb and so are the other decorations. The Buddha is dressed in different sets of clothes dependent on the season and since there are three seasons in Thailand there are three sets of clothes made out of gold. The clothes are changed by the King or his family members in a ceremony , this part of the information was courtesy the guide."

Absolutely amazing! What a wonderful service offered to the tourists who visit the palace. We also appreciated the generous service of loaning garments for those who not appropriately attired. After the long trek to the temple, we would have hated to leave since my husband was in shorts, but they loaned us pants and have a well operated lending station. The temple and Royal Palace are worth the admission price of 500 baht and so is the guide."

Demons have green faces and wear shoes, Monkeys are open mouthed and barefoot. There's a huge mural depicting the Ramayana in one of the halls. No photos allowed in the main hall housing the Buddha, so you will have to buy a postcard if you want to remember what he was like.

As Thai, I have been there few times....This temple is an important place for Thai people; it used to be where the Kings lived at the establishment period of Bangkok but the monarchy has not been living there for ages; the temple is still used in some formal royal ceremonies. You will get to see different architecture styles. However, it is prohibited to take photos of Emerald Buddha himself. If you would like to see cultures and learn a bit more of Thai history then, you have to visit this place.If you are not that interested in history, it's still worth visiting this place to see beautiful Thai architectures.If you miss visiting this place when coming to Bangkok, it'd be like you go to Rome without visiting the Colosseum! Anyway, the tips are to wear long pants and t-shirt or shirts with sleeves. There is a sarong (Thai long skirt) and long pants rental available in case you got your shorts and tank tops on.Furthermore, it's really hot and humid so bring a small towel and a bottle of water with you.

This is a Buddha which strikes you as being quite different when you come here after having seen the massive reclining gold plated Buddha. This idol is made from green jade, although it is called called the Emerald Buddha! A misnomer!You move in a queue and go up a few steps to enter a large hall and then you see the pale green idol, raised up high on a pedestal. It was interesting to learn that the garb of the Buddha is changed thrice a year depending on the season. The dressing of the Buddha used to be done by the King. Now that the king has aged, it falls on the Crown Prince to reach up to the pedestal to change its clothes! I expect the Prince must be hoisted up on a cherry picker or similar device. And on the three days in the year when the idol is having its seasonal change of clothes, I was told the temple is closed to visitors. But given the number of similar scams in Bangkok, I would check this out!"

This complex of buildings, statues and monuments, including the Temple of the Emerald Buddha and the royal palace is one of the great places to visit in the world. Everywhere you look is a beautiful sight....inspired Thai architecture, golden statures and spires, high roofed buildings, and beautiful planted details. The complex is a major holy sight to he Buddhist people, so proper dress is required. 3 men in our tour group were wearing shorts, and they had to rent long pants in order to visit the Temple. Same for women....those is shorts or short skirts had to rent a cloth to make into a wraparound skirt, and those with bare shoulders had to wear a cloth shawl.The grounds are fairly large, and are totally immaculate....no trash anywhere, and the maintenance on the buildings, grounds and lawns is perfect. The Emerald Buddha is in a typically opulent building. You must remove your shoes to enter, and no pictures are allowed inside where the Buddha is located. It is about 2-3 feet tall, and is made of jade. Every couple of months the king has to come and change the Buddha's clothing...apparently there are several different outfits.This visit is certainly on a par with Notre Dame in Paris, the Blue Mosque in Istanbul and the palaces in St. Petersburg as 'bucket list' sights that you don't want to miss."

We found the architecture absolutely extraordinary, and all the buildings magnificent. It was interesting how there was this humongous area for such a small Buddha, because the actual \"Emerald Buddha\" (made of Jade) is quite small. The cultural and religious experiences at this temple are endless, and those of all ethnic backgrounds will enjoy it thoroughly. Even my two children (ages 14 and 8) were beyond thrilled! An important thing to remember is to wear long pants and sleeved shirts because you will not be allowed into the temple without them.

The Temple is on the Grand Palace grounds, and you must pay admission for entry to the temple, even though there is no fee to get into the gated grounds of the palace complex.Proper attire is required of everyone visiting the palace grounds. Visitors can't wear shorts or sleeveless tops, and women can't wear short dresses. You can rent appropriate clothing just inside the main gate for 200 baht, which is refundable when you return the clothing. Vendors also sell proper clothing just outside the gate. There is no refund for those items though.Admission to the Temple grounds is about $15 US, which gains you access to all areas except the administrative and residential buildings. A complimentary brochure is provided at the entrance, which gives you background information and history, so you know what you're looking at. Once inside, you can also buy a guided tour for an additional $15 US, but I find that I can't understand the English of most tour guides in Bangkok. It's difficult to describe the splendor here. Plan to spend a few hours gawking at every ornate inch of the magnificent architecture throughout the palace grounds. The inside of the Temple is adorned with so much gold, it almost hurts your eyes to look. Photography is prohibited inside. The Emerald Buddha is, in fact, carved from a block of jade and has a fascinating history.End your visit at the coffee bar just outside the clothing rental area, where cold fruit smoothies are available for about $2.50 US. Don't miss the Temple of the Emerald Buddha."

Our guide for the day was Rio, a very enrtertaining and informative guide. We found both the temple and palace visits to be very interesting. The one thing that spoils almost every trip or tour in Bangkok, seems to be the \"connection\" between the taxis and tour busses and the local gemstone shops. Every single taxi and tour wants to take you past the gemstone factory where you are told that you will be told how gem stones are mined and cut. Quite interesting we thought, not so! You are whisked past the \"factory side\" very quickly and shown around their giant show room where pushy and demanding sales people become rather sulky when you fail to purchase. We were conned into this visit once and then a second time when we took a random taxi. So a major tip, INSIST on going directly to the destination of your choice and do not be conned into a visit to a tailor or a gemstone shop - its a waste of good holiday time and not a pleasant experience if you don't shop at the stores!"

None of my arms or upper shoulder was exposed so I was not sure why this was but didn't want to argue. This policy is not universally enforced as we walked past many women with spaghetti straps. Whatever you do, don't get stuck wearing one of their borrowed shirts. They don't make for very flattering pictures. We went on a Monday morning. It was very crowded However, it was not so crowded that you couldn't take a picture if you were willing to wait for a few minutes. We arrived around 10am and left around 12pm. It was sweltering hot.

In my opinion, it's one of those attractions that you can miss but if you're in the area, then stop in."

We visited the Temple of the Emerald Buddha just after the Chinese New Year and although quite a few people at the site it wasn't too bad.We went with the River Tourist Bus which cost 40 Baht each way and it was great fun and the river pier is only 5 minutes walk from the entrance to the Temple and the adjoining Grand Palace which you can visit at the same time.The temple grounds are full of smaller temples, stupas and buildings in fantastic Thai architecture covered in amazing gold mosaics and wall decorations and together with Beautiful statues in the perfectly manicured gardens make this quite a special place.The Emerald Buddha is sited in the main temple surrounded by lavish ornaments and decorations.This is the most important Buddha statue for the Thai people and it's imperative that visitors realise that this is a place of worship so long trousers and shirts with sleeves is a must.To us this is the must visit place in Bangkok and it encapsulates everything that is Thailand.Don't miss it."

As our visit was in the middle of winter we expected wearing the mandatory covered shoulders and ankles wouldn't be a problem, we were wrong, there is a lot of ground to cover at the grand palace before you arrive at the emerald Buddha, and it's hot! Luckily we bought some banana leaf traditional Thai umbrella's (3 for 500baht) before we went in because we wouldn't have made the whole tour.We had 6 people (each with different levels of enthusiasm and interest) So we decided to get a guide I think we paid 500 baht, our guide spoke good English as gave us enough information that we felt like we learned about the Thia history, traditions and monarchy-which is of great importance to the Thia's and valuable to know about if you plan on spending any amount of time here. Our guide was incredibly patient, as half of our group are filmmakers and consequently like to \"capture\" their experiences-which can be timely, while waiting for our group to catch up, she shared her knowledge and experiences with us generously.Make sure you wear a hat/buy an umbrella pack your camera and take a water bottle."

Also take care for the \"advisors\" in the street just at the entrance to Grand Palace who try to convince you to visit different other Buddha monuments instead. We were told that the Palace is closed but \"naturally\" it was open. Someone else told us that What Arun is closed but again it was open. Do onot listen to these people!Wat Phra Kaeo includes several beautifully decorated buildings including the home of emerald Buddha. You may spend 2 hours among thees building there are so many beauties around.Unfortunately there are no English information tables this is why some time it is difficult to understand what you see."

Depending on the time of year he is dressed in different outfits (made of Gold!). I would recommend visiting this attraction along with the rest of the Grand Palace!"

The Buddha itself is small and is actually made from Jade but the sheer size and nature of the complex itself is truly amazing and it takes nearly a half a day to thoroughly get around all the buildings to see everything on offer. This is the second time i have been through this complex and i think only now the second time have i managed to experience the entire place! Be aware though that both male and females need to be appropriately dressed, so to get in quicker make sure you carry a sarong or long pants in your pack and wear a shirt that covers your shoulders. Also, there are always those people outside the palace who will try to tell you the place is closed or redirect you to the wrong entrance.

The temple seemed to just glitter and shine on the day we were there.Make sure you dress appropriately, otherwise you will have to rent uncomfortable hot clothing.Tour guides wait outside to offer to help you. I prefer not to have someone talking the whole time. Instead just leaisurly explore the temple. Bring one of the DK books to give you insight instead.The Emerald Buddha was much smaller than we expected."

The entire temple and the Grand Palace are all breathtaking and really provide an insight into Thai culture and Buddhism itself. I would recommend renting an audio guide for 200Baht, as it provides an in-depth guide to all the attractions, and will leave you with a wealth of knowledge. Remember to wear long pants, as you will required to rent these if you do not. This venue requires 1-3 hours to explore and try to be patient with the horde of tourists that will be there. Water is required or face the overpriced stall owners. Many great photo opportunities here and a MUST visit!"

It's tough to see the Buddha because it is not huge, and it sits on a high pedestal in the middle of the temple. Many people kneel to pray in front so you can't get too close, and no photos are allowed. Interesting history, though, on how and where it was discovered.

Sadly they do not allow you to take photographs inside the temple which is understandable considering the fact that it is still an active temple. The only problem is that the crowd gets to you in your experience and if you seek for a little time to admire the place, then it could be difficult. While there I also saw some of the monks in practice and it was a divine view to have experienced with the whole interiors of the temple. The temple forms the part of the Grand Palace complex and like many other structures around it, the place is breathtaking. The place opens around 8 in the morning and expects you to be modestly dressed. It will be a good thing to catch this place early in the morning to avoid the push and pulls of the crowds."

Be sure to be close to the main entrance of the palace complex so that you can be at the temple complex with minimal people around. It gets very crowded very fast and it'll be hard to take photos.Its good to take a guide who will explain about the history of this temple and other palaces inside grand palace. Believe me i didnt took a guide and i wasnt able to understand anything.Believe me after seeing so many temples you will get bored and tired of walking inside grand palace, hence you need a guide who will keep your interest."

Be sure to be close to the main entrance of the palace complex so that you can be at the temple complex with minimal people around. It gets very crowded very fast and it'll be hard to take photos. Nowadays its a trend to visit the temple complex first and then other places within the palace complex. So, try to visit the temple complex in the end, within the grand palace complex so that the crowd could be relatively lesser. Temple and its surroundings are just amazing with vivid colors. The actual Emarald Buddha statue is small and you're not allowed to take photos of it within the main temple. A fee of 150 BHT for the entrance of Grand palace is worth the views in the temple complex."

We were not just looking but gaining a knowledge and insight into its history and building of this exquisite Wat Phra Kaeo.This building was only a portion of the tour which included The Royal Grand Palace, The Reclining Buddha etc. Ms Pu kindly took photos of the numerous points of interest for me, being an older person, and of myself and daughter.Thoroughly enjoyed our tour although a bit tiring - not to be missed though."

Nothing to compare with the Lying Down Budda or the thousand buddas at Wat Pho. If you have the time and you were at the Grand Palace, might as well have a visit. However, if there are lots of people and you hate the heat, then you can skip."

There's a neat story about this Buddha, but first, logistics: this temple is located within the walls of the Grand Palace compound, so you'll need to pay admission to the palace grounds in order to see it. If you're there anyway -- and you should be! -- it's worth visiting the Temple of the Emerald Buddha, which is considered the most sacred Buddhist Temple in Thailand. Remember that you will not be permitted inside sacred temples or royal sites such as this one without proper attire: covered shoulders (t-shirts okay) and pants or skirts at least a couple inches below the knee. You can rent pants or a long skirt at the main gate for ~$7. Flip-flops are allowed but you'll have to take any footwear off when entering certain buildings, including this one.Though legend dates this carved Buddha back about two thousand years, modern chronicles place its discovery in the early 15th century, after a lightning storm struck a temple in Chiang Rai. The statue, covered in plaster to conceal its value and placed among other lesser images, fell to the ground and revealed a glimmer of green stone. Monks discovered a perfect carved Buddha, about two feet tall, made from a single hunk of jade. (Yes, jade -- not an actual emerald.) It has traveled a great deal since then, until being housed reverentially on the Grand Palace grounds in 1782. Only the king can touch it. So yes, it is small; and no, pictures are not allowed out of respect for its religious significance. But even so and even at a distance, the emerald Buddha is quite a sight."

As we moved in we noticed several huge pagodas and yakshas and kinnaras. Each building was more beautiful than the other and it is a photographers paradise. The yakshas guarding each room entrance are beautifully carved and along with the smaller versions of the same they set up the ambience of the temple very well. The golden pagoda and the spires of the other pagodas form a beautiful backdrop to this amazing temple. Take time to soak in the richness and the intricacy of the architecture. The carving on every wall has been very carefully and meticulously done and as you proceed to see the Emerald Buddha spend some time to also notice the painting of the Ramakien or the Ramayana as it is popularly known. There are very colorful and lavish paintings of this epic all along the walls of this temple, The paintings are simply exotic.The Emerald Buddha is a very small statue but a stunning one. And the room in which he is housed is gorgeously and richly decorated. You have to spend couple of minutes to admire the detail of the paintings on the ceiling and the walls. You can take pictures of Buddha from outside. In all it is a stunning temple and a must visit when in Bangkok."

Walking around wouldn't do it, it really pays to have a tour guide with you. The key to this experience is in the details of the stories behind the attraction.Coming up close to the temples & seeing the detailed handcrafted work done on it, and not to mention its size, it's simply amazing.It's a little crowded though, and it gets hot later in the day. There's not much to rest your feet too. If you're in Bangkok, don't miss this one.Tip: dress appropriately. Ask locals what to wear. We wore black & white only because it was a time if mourning for the nation at that time. Red was discouraged because of a political uprising involving that color at that time too. Bring water, umbrella (for the heat or in case it rains), and shades."

Besides the overwhelming architecture and despite how crowded it can get, you can actually feel peace and well being while walking around the place. The emerald Buddha is the most revered image in Thailand, so dress accordingly, don't photograph it and don't point your feet to it while sitting!!! It is better to walk the place in flip flops or sandals because you must be barefoot to enter any building. Being a religious place, no shouting is allowed. If you are lucky, you can take pictures of monks passing by. Once you tour the site (including an incredible maquette of Angkor wat!) you get to the royal palace, which stands out from the others since it looks very European.Take your time to walk the place!

This is located on the grounds of the Grand Palace, and is the first area that you have access to after going through security. There are quite a lot of details to be seen on the Wat Phra Kaew grounds. This is almost like the \u201ccan\u2019t see the trees because of the forest\u201d. Besides all the highly decorated temples, you will see the first of several giant ogres. There are many other mythical creatures on the ground that are highly decorated. You can see from the many photos of the sites how beautiful all the building on the temple grounds are decorated. The inside of the walls that surround the whole complex is painted with murals that were originally painted in the late 1700.Prior to your visit to the temple area, it would be helpful as an aid to print out a map of Wat Phra Kaeo from Wikipedia. This map has all the structures and figures label as to what it is and their locations. I noted that some reviewers only describe their visit to the main temple that house the Emerald Buddha, and yes, it would be disappointing if this was the only thing to be seen here. The temple area is a very large complex, and it would take several hours to see everything in this one section.Visit Notes:The three attractions, Grand Palace, Wat Pho (Temple of the Emerald Buddha, and Wat Pho, will consume a good portion of your day. The main entrance is located on the middle of the north wall. The street areas are lined with sidewalk vendors. The entry fee, which includes both Wat Phra Kaeo and the Grand Palace is 500 baht. To enter the temple that housed the Emerald Buddha, you will have to take your shoes off outside. No photography is allowed inside this temple. Bring your own water, as there are no vendors once inside the paid entry area. No bare shoulder, shorts, capri pants is allowed when visiting the Grand Place ground. Once through the gate, you may have to temporary rent a shawl, sarong, or a pair of pants. You only have to put a deposit of 200 baht for the rental and the 200 baht is returned at the end of the visit. Other reviewers are miss-informed, thinking they had to rent the garment for 200 baht. You get your 200 baht back when you return the garment. Miss-information and Scams:Depending on how you get there, taxi, tut-tut, ferry, you may be approached or informed by your driver that the place is closed for a holiday or a special event is taking place and no one is allowed in for a few hours. They will then volunteer to take you to another place that is just as good or better. On the way, they will stop off at the \u201csponsor\u201d, who has great prices on anything you want to buy. This is just a scam, in the high fare to take you to the \u201cbetter spot\u201d, and to the store front with the great prices."

On the list was Temple of Dawn, Reclining Buddha, and Emerald Buddha. In that order it was cheapest to most expensive entry fees at 50, 100, 500 baht per person. While I felt the Emerald Buddha was a must do and I still think it is, the experience was not awesome. After leaving the Reclining Buddha we thought it would be an easy walk to the Grand Palace entrance but it was quite far(wish we had taken a tuk-tuk but they are WAY over-priced in this area!). After arriving at the entrance I could barely see the ground because there were so many tourists(hoards of Chinese!). We debated going in because we thought it was going to be 400 baht each and it had gone up to 500 baht. After a quick debate we decided we were here and it was a \"must see\". The ticket price does include entrance to the Grand Palace, Emerald Buddha, and the Queen's Museum of Textiles. We shuffled our way to the Emerald Buddha where shoes need to be removed and it was a one way in entrance(which was good for the crowds). Unfortunately half of the room/view was under construction tarp with scaffolding, which really was an eye sore! The other half you could see the Emerald Buddha. It was beautiful to look at(no pictures allowed!)but I wish you could get closer to see it because it is so small you cannot take in all the detail of it from where you and the hoards of others are. We didn't spend much time in this room and we moved outside. There was a very impressive model of Angor Wat which was one of the highlights for us! We viewed some of the other areas but did not go into the Textile Museum as the crowds were too much. We left after about just over an hour and I am glad we did it but I am not sure it was worth 1000 baht for 2 people. I struggled with an average or very good rating and I decided to go with very good even though the crowds, construction, and fee put a damper on the visit! The Temple of Dawn was only 50 baht and the Reclining Buddha was 100! Much better priced!FYI: DO NOT TAKE A TAXI OR TUK-TUK THAT IS SITTING RIGHT OUTSIDE THE ENTRANCE TO THE GRAND PALACE! ALL OF THEM ARE RIDICULOUSLY OVER-PRICED, GIVE YOU SET FARES INSTEAD OF THE METER, AND ARE CRANKY! Instead my husband and I hung a right out of the Palace, went around the first corner and flagged down a tuk-tuk that was dropping a fare off. He tried to charge 50 baht but my husband got him to 20 baht because we needed less than a 5 min ride to the ferry at the Reclining Buddha."

The times of the free tours are 10.00am & 10.30am , 1.30pm & 2.00pm. You will not be disappointed with any of the tour.

Getting into the grounds and then again into the building to see the Emerald Buddha is like going into any transit station during rush hour. We went shortly after noon on a Monday so maybe that was a peak time. Next time I go I'll inquire about what days and times it might be less crowded. The grounds are spacious but still full of visitors everywhere.Go with a good guidebook, hire a guide, or rent an audio guide near the ticket counters to understand all that there is there to see."

The Buddah is small and at quite a distance. We visited on a weekend when some of the attractions were closed. The dress code for ladies didnt seem always to be enforced and saw several women with short skirts or t shirts with shoulders showing. The dressing area where you can borrow 'cover ups' was busy with queues. Watch out for the touts outside. We never managed to get a taxi to turn on its meter so had to negotiate fee. Traffic in Bangkok horrendous so make sure air con works in the cab of your choice as you will be in there for quite a while."

PROS: We booked the \"Wat Phra Kaew (Temple of the Emerald Buddha) and The Grand Palace Complex\" tour together through TripAdvisor/Viator.com. The temples and palace are beautiful and really can only be appreciated in person. Pictures just don't do them justice. PROS: \"Yelly\" our tour guide was great. Perfect English and she knew everything and more and obviously has an appreciation for history. We did the AM tour during the week and we had her and the courtesy van/driver to ourselves. Temple and palace are PACKED but \"Yelly\" went out of her way to keep us out of the people traffic so we had plenty of space to enjoy ourselves and hear what she had to say. TIPS: Try to go with as few people as possible!!! Wear long pants, shoes and t-shirt. You are outside in the sun for almost whole tour so wear hat, sunglasses, sunscreen, or umbrella!!! Insist that you want to go straight back to your hotel at end of palace and temple tour.CONS / SCAM: ** Instead of driving you straight back to your hotel as advertised...they will take you to the \"Gems Gallery\". It's a very safe, very large, modern jewelry store BUT it's a scam to get you to buy things. Then when we finished our tour guide sent us in a courtesy van provided by the jewelry store...not our original tour van and driver. I'm sure our tour guide gets some sort of pay-out for delivering us to the jewelry store. My husband was really angry about the forced scam at the end it ruined the morning for him :("

The entrance fee was 500 bath which is quite expensive for BKK standards. At the beginning I was given some pants because shorts aren't allowed inside. Once inside there are a lot of temples which you can visit. Since it was very warm and crowded we went straight to the most important temple, the one with the emerald green buddha. This golden coloured temple was nice to view, the Buddha is actually quite small though. The guards in a temple nearby were also quite cool, not moving at all, kind of like the guards at Buckingham palace. We took some pictures of the other temples and went for the exit. Since it was very warm, we decided that we had enough culture for the day!"

I liked seeing the different swords - Thai, Japanese, Korean, etc. We didn't go into the Queen's Textile Museum though because we'd just be looking at dresses, fabrics, and textiles - which is not to my interest. It's really one of the best temples to visit in a short time frame. By the way, I read that girls must wear dresses or long skirts but not pants so we came wearing skirts. But we saw there there were some girls wearing jeans and pants, too. So it doesn't really matter weather girls wears pants, dresses, or skirts as long as it's not revealing."

They do provide a sarong and shirt free of charge on returnable basis.The entry to the Complex shuts at 3.30 pm. The place is quite crowded and one is warned to take care of one's belongings. the entry fee is 500 Bhats, which is quite expensive, but I consider a visit to this complex a must.One must take the services of an Official Guide , so that one can see all the places properly.While in the temple of the Buddha, while sitting, one must not point one's feet towards the Buddha."

Legend said, that the Jade Buddha has been the symbol of kingdom in Thailand for hundreds of years. So it's like a power symbol for the kingdom, despite of its relatively smaller size compared to other Buddha statues in the country. It is also serve like a welfare amulet for the Thais. On several occasions, the Jade Buddha is paraded around the city. It is believed that the Jade Buddha can cure the sickness and bring luck to the people.That's also why, it receives \"special\" treatment from the royals. King of Thailand takes care the statue with his own hand. The most well-known ritual is the cloth-changing ritual, when the King replace the sheath covering of the statue with his own hand. There are three kind of covers the Jade Buddha has, and each depends on the season in Thailand. Since Thailand has three seasons (summer, rainy, and cold), there will be three cloth-changing rituals in a year. You can see a brief video exhibition of this ritual in a small museum called \"The Pavilion of Regalia\", located between the ticket locket and the entrance gate to the main Grand Palace complex. The Jade Buddha's clothings are stored in this pavilion. From outside, the Pavilion of Regalia (a small museum) looks like an ordinary souvenir stall, so many visitors do not recognized it. Ticket to enter Grand Palace complex is bundled with three exhibitions, the Grand Palace complex, the Pavilion of Regalia, and the Queen Sirikit textile museum. So make sure you don't skip any of them. To save your time the best sequence after you purchase the ticket of Grand Palace Complex area would be like this:0. Purchase the ticket --- only one locket in this complex.1. Visit the Pavilion of Regalia (I put a picture of it), in about 15-20 steps from the locket.2. Grand Palace complex.3. Go to the Queen Sirikit Textile Museum on the way back.Hmmm... I think I should post this info at the Grand Palace section too.Wonder how many visitors skipped that Pavilion of Regalia.Cheers!"

Despite its relatively small size (compared to other Buddha images in other temples), the Emerald Buddha is deemed to be the most revered in Bangkok, and for good reason: it is the holiest since only the Thai King has the right to touch it and change its robe thrice a year (according to the season). It is said to be cut entirely out of a single piece of jade (not emerald as the name suggests), and is probably about a couple of feet tall, but sits in a golden altar probably 10 feet high. Try to come here as early as you can; you don't want to be here around noon time when there are lots of tourists already and everybody is sweating like a pig amid the city's humidity. The combined smell of different people's body odor and the dampness of the air within the temple is just nauseating."

This one has lift acces if you cant negotiate the stairs not the Golden Buddha temple in another review..sorry my mistake. This is a very large temple and once again included in a half day tour is a must to see when visiting Bangkok. At all temples you need to be prepared to take off your shoes before entering. Try and avoid lace up shoes like I did as you get plenty of practice doing up your laces each time. Also men must wear long pants and at least a short sleave shirt...t-shirts and singlets and bare skin are not permitted entry...so if you have tatts cover them up...you can hire long pants and shirts at these locations...you can always tell the ones who dont read the tourist literature or take the advice from the tour company.Also at this temple was this young guy taking photos of people stopping to have a photo taken. I found out why when I returned back down the stairs as he presents you on a tray with your photo on a badge/fridge magnet with Bangkok and the year...how could I resist 200 baht for 2 then he offers you another 2 for 100 baht...well I thought gifts for the staff to remember their boss. so I ended up with 4...great fun and great momento of your visit. so clever to make in about 20 minutes."

The tour was great, whilst scripted, we managed to get our guide off script with a few questions.

As you need to cover your legs and shoulders in your dressing, at the entrance you can lend long skirts/pants and shirts for a deposit of 200 baht which you get back after returning the clothes, thus do not bother to buy at the shops opposite the road.The temple grounds are huge and a free map will be provided to walk through the different halls and temples and the grand palace of course.

There's beautiful architecture and you can see the emerald buddha. We also saw the young buddha's walking on the grounds often.One of the rules of visiting this temple is that men must wear long pants and women long dresses. So if you go there with shorts, there's people there that will provide you with some proper garments. Also there's people selling water before you walk onto the grounds. It's much cheaper to get water bottles from them rather than inside, which is recommended since it's really hot in Bangkok most of the year."

The Temple of the Emerald Buddha (actually spelled Wat Phra Kaew, not Kaeo) and its many surrounding buildings/structures are simply one of the most stunning sights/sites you'll ever lay eyes on. Soaring spires, glittering gold, religious reverence ... pure magic.Arrive early, right when the complex opens at 8:30am. Then, make a bee-line right away to the Temple of the Emerald Buddha and you'll have some temporary peace and quiet to reflect on the star attraction himself, the 'Emerald Buddha', sitting high atop his multi-tiered, gloriously golden throne. He actually does seem to have an ethereal glow. Part of the magic is being able to observe reverent Thais paying their utmost respects to the Emerald Buddha who represents the very soul of Thailand.You can't take pictures of the Emerald Buddha while inside his temple which makes sense to maintain some semblance of peace and decorum. However, when you're standing outside the temple, the window in between the 2 side entrances gives you a nice vantage point with which to use your camera's zoom to snap a very nice pic of the small-in-size, mighty-in-stature Emerald Buddha (please see my pics below).Having paid your respects to the star attraction, you can now more leisurely stroll the grounds, admiring all the dazzling architecture and exquisite attention to detail. Be sure your camera's battery is fully charged because you will be snapping away madly. Definitely wander over to the north side of the complex to see an amazingly detailed scale model of Angkor Wat which will prompt you to book a side trip to Cambodia to see it in person!Then, as the touristic wave begins to wash over the whole scene and the sizzling heat begins to intensify, you can make your graceful exit before 10am and wander towards the south to drop in next door at Wat Po (Temple of the Reclining Buddha), once again a step ahead of the big crowds.TIPS: easiest way to get there is taking the Chao Phraya Express Boat to Pier #9 (Tha Chang). Walk straight away from the river and keep walking thru the food market due east, you'll quickly see the high white wall surrounding the complex. Do NOT listen to anyone trying to tell you the Temple is closed (it's open EVERY day). Easiest way to get to Chao Phraya Express Boat is to take the BTS Skytrain to Saphan Taksin Station and take very short walk to Central Pier (Tha Sathorn). DRESS MODESTLY! Tops have to at least have short sleeves, covering the shoulders. Strictly NO shorts ... or you'll have to rent some dirty, sweaty long skirt-like thing to cover your bare legs. ENJOY!"

The Buddha himself is a small idol perched right on top of the foundation (sorry if I didnt get the Buddhist terms right) and it may well be only after you come out that you realize you had just been to the Temple of the Emerald Buddha, unless you are glued on to the Map they give you with the ticket. No photos inside, but sitting for a while not just lets you escape the fury of the Thai sun, but lets you contemplate what surrounds you, with a thought on the amount of patience, skill and eye for detail that must have gone into creating this marvel."

Very imposing they were and some gold colored and some antique finish and some filled with gold foils and glass chips. The Museum is a must and this helps us understand the Thai History better . There is a portion in the premises where there are 108 Murals which depicts the story of Ramayana . Beautiful paintings and took us some time to see it all . Then to the actual Temple where The Emerald Buddha is mounted on a golden pedestal . The Idol of Buddha itself is very small and the Temple is fully decorated with gold carvings and paintings and very peaceful and silence maintained . Total peace existed in this temple. Our Tour guide Ms . Aom , explained the different stories and history of this Royal Temple. It was great experience here and our guide was very friendly and we became good friends .

The meter goes by distance and if there is alot of traffic (which there is!) they don't make any money. Another tip...seek out the new modern restrooms.

Just imagine that all these built and decorated by hand. Trully history place. Visit the little museum before the entrance to the palace (inside the gates, just right after the ticket counter); it is included in your ticket. It will give you some history on Thailand and its Royal family, as well as history of Emerald Buddha. Once you inside the palace grounds you will see Buddha himself. You will require to take your shoes off before intering temple. We just took out shoes in plastic bag, or you can leave them outside like all other people do. Please be respectfull to Thai religion and do not take photo in the temple. Sad to see tourists from civilised countries ignoring rules.Entrance to palace territory is 500 BHT per person. Buy tickets only inside the gates ( about 50 miters after the security point). Do not listen to anyone who says that Palace is closed or that you have to pay for ticket to them. You can skip the paid tour guide if you do some research in advance and just print some information of Internet. When you are on your own you have freedom of walking anywhere anytime you want. Its a holly place, so gents are required <no short; no open shoulders>; for ladies <knees covered, no open shoulders>. Guards are strikt and will not let you in. If you still forgot to cover up, you can rent sarong right there (on the right after security point) .If you need to ask anyone for assistance, approach guard in uniform or policeman.Its hard to take taxi from there. Two taxies did not want to take us to our place \" too much traffic\". So good luck with that. Have place you want to go writen in thai language, as most of taxi driver do not speak english."

Women must have their knees & shoulders covered. Thongs are a no no & sandals must have an ankle strap.If you are travelling independently, be aware that the taxis out the front turn their meters off for the return trip & may try & charge you double what it cost to get out there. We paid 150BHT on the meter to get out there from our hotel & the taxis were trying to charge 400BHT to get back. We hired a tuk tuk & agreed on 200 BHT. The alternative is to public transport it- ferry from Saphin Taksin plus a ferry plus a walk, but to be honest, it was so FLIPPING hot, the walk bit was not at all attractive!Anyways, despite the crowd, despite the transport hassles, this is a must see."

We only had a few hours before we had to check out and leave for the airport so we decided to take the sky train to the river ferry express boat (40 baht each way) up to see the Grand Palace and the Temple of the Emerald Buddha. Easily could have spent 4 hours just looking at all of the intricate murals filled with demons, battles, and seductive women but there were also all of the glittering buildings covered with bits of hand-cut mirror in various colors, sparkling in the sun like jewels and the gilded temples and ornate giant demons guarding the grounds. It was one of the more expensive things to do at 500 baht entry, but that also included a visit to the Grand Palace. Next time I plan to bring a hat for the sun was blazing on my head and to spend more time in the mural galleries. It really was quite glorious and worth the price. Just remember to wear or bring along clothing the covers your knees and shoulders and pants that are not tight. They heavily enforce proper dress here and if you don't bring anything they do have loaners available for free (though just outside some locals have seen fit to capitalize on people by charging them 30 baht to borrow clothes even though there is a sign clearly pointing out inside it's available for free). Just bring your own. I wore a long dress and threw a t-shirt over it to cover my shoulders and took it off when I left. My boyfriend had pants with zip-off legs which he zipped on to enter, and zipped off to exit."

So we were in terrible shape as we reached the temple complex. Being vegetarians, finding food was a trick too. So we consumed a lot of fresh fruit and went for buying Temple entrance Ticket. It was a stiff 500 Baht per head and I was wondering why a temple entry shoud be so costly. Anyway, we not only bought entry ticket but also hired a 200 Baht Audio guide ( on a hand held computer). The audio guide put pressure on us because it was supposed to be returned in 2hours.Armed with Audio guide we stepped into the temple complex which was so glorious that we soon forgot our sleepless night and heat of the Sun and started visiting 20 plus temples one by one and each one was a beauty. The highlight is no doubt the Emerald Buddha statue with a Golden Shroud. The statue was glowing magically and was some sight. Only \"sight\" because no photography allowed for the statue. The temple complex is followed by a visit to Royal Palace, where even Obama was hosted, it was said! The palaces were great pieces of architecture and were followed by a few museums, which were more of commercial ventures. One museum of the Queen however was impressive, with exquisite Royal ward robe. The Thai style silk dresses of the Queen were pieces of Art ,and the cut and stich was fascinating. So in all we spent 2 hours in hot Sun and clicked hundreds of photos. My wife kept clicking almost non stop!"

Very neat place. Tons of photo opportunities abound in the outside areas but you are not allowed to take photos inside or talk while you are there. Our guide told us if you stand outside looking into the temple there is an area you can see the emerald buddha at and take a photo of it from the outside area. When you walk in the temple, the small emerald buddha is placed up high and is draped with a gold cloth depending on what season it is then. Many people will pray while they are in the temple to show respect to the buddha. After we left the temple you could put holy water on yourself if you wanted. There was also a place to give an offering before you went into the temple and that was neat to see what people left - flowers or beetle nut I think it was called were mainly the offerings left. Must see this if you visit the Grand Palace. Book a private tour guide for more information and you won't regret it!"

In case you want to bow and offer prayers to Buddha, sit in a way that your feet are away from the statue (best tucked under you, look around for examples). Being an Indian, I am so used to historical, old temples that all the newness was altogether a different perspective. I am from Kushinagar in India, where Lord Buddha took his last breath. There we have a very old Buddha statue, which might not be as expensive, but in its presence you feel humbled. Worth a visit, but if you are a sucker for history would be a little disappointed :)"

But the Emerald Buddha, perched high and far away on a platform, was simply majestic. And beautiful. Even though the statue is not a big one - unlike the reclining Buddha - the temple was filled with devotees praying and making offerings. From what we could gather, local people come here in large numbers to mark special occasions and present some really expensive stuff as offerings.We sat on the floor for about 15 - 20 minutes, not only as a mark of respect but also to fully observe and absorb the scene. The temple is obviously very rich and opulent, what with a non-stop stream of devotees.For tourists it naturally is a big attraction because of its beauty and fame. Also the fact that it is inside the Royal Palace, which I guess every tourist to Bangkok visits, makes it extremely popular.A reputation fully deserved. Go experience it.Remember - footwear is not allowed inside the temple. Neither is photography. Sit and immerse yourself in the peace for some time. Do not point your feet towards the Buddha while sitting."

You can only stare in awe at the artistry and splendour of the place, with all its gold statues and buildings (real gold!), as well as the ceramic and mirrored tile d\u00e9cor. The upkeep, which must be incredibly costly and time consuming, is evident everywhere, as the site looks like new. Very inspirational to watch devout Buddhists pray in front of the Emerald Buddha. Quite a story as well! I would suggest you either take a guided group tour, at the least, or hire a private guide, as it is impossible to understand the significance of everything if you are not a local, or a least a Buddhist. Look up and around at the details, there is something to see everywhere you look.  There is a beautifully painted wall as you exit the temple area into the Royal Palace grounds with the story of Buddha which is very interesting, but if you take a group tour they don't spend enough time here, so plan accordingly. Be prepared for crowds! Holy cow! We went on a Sunday, which was probably a mistake, so go on a weekday if you can. Be advised, they are very strict about dress code, especially for ladies, so dress appropriately. Don't rent clothes outside the site, as it is free inside, you just need to put down a security deposit. It is very hot inside the grounds, with little air circulation. Bring water, as you cannot purchase any until the end of your visit.One unfortunate thing did happen to us: we were told by the tour guide that we could come back through and take pictures at the end of the tour, but that turned out to be false. It is a one time entry ticket only. So take all your pictures while inside! Plan on between 2 to 4 hours, depending on the crowds and your level of interest, to visit both the Temple and Royal Palace grounds."

I recommend taking the audio guide (you can share one for 2) as it really helps structure the visit and understand the history of the site. We spent around 3 hours there but would probably have spent 1 hour without the guide. There is a free app you can download with more information around the palace which can maybe replace the audio guide/map.As in every temple, you will have to dress appropriately - no sleeveless shirts/visible shoulders or shorts/skirts above the knees. You will have to remove your shoes several times and leave them unattended so make sure to take comfy shoes that are not too valuable.Getting there by taking the boat and going through the small local market adds to the charm of the visit. The amulet market is close-by as well."

To the eye - just the kaleidescope of colors (golds, greens, blues, reds, yellows) from rooftops, 20 foot tall guardian sculptures, wall murals, walls, ceilings, benches, fences... Truly - everything glints in the sun and catches your eye. The emerald buddha (made out of jade) is in itself much smaller than one would imagine, but he too, sits on a gilded platform, and commands a presense, where worshippers lay fresh lotus flowers at his feet and come in to pay their respects. There were a ton of people, but it was still a friendly crowd - most folks smiling and showing every courtesy to keep from making a hot day, uncomfortable. This was definitely a \"must-do\" when visiting Bangkok. Just remember the proper etiquette must be followed -- shoes off before entering the temple and no sleeveless shirts or shorts (coverings should be worn around the shoulders and at least down to the knees)."

The temple of the Emerald Buddah is in the same complex as the Grand Palace and attracts every visitor to Bangkok (some days it seems every visitor to Bangkok is in the temple complex at the same time!). The temple is a truly awesome sight with its brightly coloured pagodas, wats and stupas and is a 'must see' if you are in Bangkok. The Emerald Buddha is actually quite a small Buddha image but has a spiritual significance to Thais (avoid the temple on Thai holidays because the place is even more crowded than normal!). The temple is more crowded in the mornings when the tour buses decend (watching the tourist hoards is also a good way of spending 15 minutes) and I would recomend visiting after lunch as there seems to be less people about. The entrance is often packed solid but once inside the grounds are so big that you don't actually feel claustrophobic. If you are short of time I'm afraid an expensive tourist tour is your best option but if you have the time catch the express ferry from Central Pier (next to a skytrain stop) to Pier 9 and walk the 200 yards to the temple (ignoring all the chancers who try to persuade you the temple is closed in order to take you 'shopping'). If you can stand the heat and are up for a shortish walk the visit to the temple can easily be combined with a visit to Wat Pho which is about 400 yards away."

Inside you have no time to let the wonderful place overtake you with his atmosphere because the atmosphere are screaming, photos taking and pushing people. I found it terrible.Terrible is also that you see many poor people in the streets and than you pay about 17 Euro entrance here I started calculating : 17 Euro and estimated (low estimation) 20,000 people per day are more than 300,000 Euro or 400,000 USD per day.

The main building is the central ubosoth, which houses the statue of Emerald Buddha. The Emerald Buddha, a dark green statue, is in a standing form, about 66 centimetres tall, carved from a single jade stone (Emerald in Thai means deep green colour and not the specific stone). It is carved in the meditating posture in the style of the Lanna school of the northern Thailand. Except for the Thai King, no other person is allowed to touch the statue. The King changes the cloak around the statue three times a year, corresponding to the summer, winter, and rainy seasons, an important ritual performed to usher good fortune to the country during each season."

A buddha carved of a single piece of jade that stands almost 18 inches tall and has attired made of gold that is changed according to the seasons. With a long and storied history of possession--it's been captured back and forth between the Lanna kingdom of old Thailand, the Lao and Cambodian nations and it's final capture back to Thailand was the founding of the current, or Chakri dynasty--it's a fascinating piece of living history one display. Remove your shoes and don't take a camera: it's not allowed. But be prepared. It doesn't seem like much, back there by the back wall, but work your way forward and really study and then feel the devotion the Thai people around you feel. And then, when you are done there, walk around the perimeter of the temple proper and follow along with the \"Ramakien\" or the Thai national epic. Also, pick a bit of knowledge about syncretism when, after some reading, you realize that the Ramakien is in many ways almost identical to the Ramayana, a Hindu story. But the Theravadan Buddhist Thais still have markers and images in the story that resonate with their own ancient animist beliefs. Besides, the places of the narrative are in Thailand, Sri Lanka and South Asia. And the entire thing is illuminated in the form of intricate paintings, epic in scope, running hundreds of feet along a continuous alcove covered wall. I can't recommend all of this highly enough."

However, the girls and women need to wear skirt, otherwise, you're charged to change into traditional Thai skirt. The men and boys should wear trousers. It is called an official temple where the king often comes for the events. Therefore, every Thai respects this place and wears proper uniform to enter this temple. If you don't wear a proper dress, you're charged to rent one and wear it while you're there."

The Forbidden City had NOTHING on Wat Phra Kaeo in terms of visitors - at least when we were there. We were literally elbow to elbow in some places. Bring your camera, lots of patience and be mindful of your belongings.Before you go, take a second to review the dress code. Remember it's a place of worship and be respectful. Definitely cover your shoulders and make sure not to wear short shorts - many people had to \"rent\" clothes (available on-site) so that they would be suitably covered. We read that open toed/heeled sandals were not allowed, but saw many many people with flip flops, crocs and other sandals on."

Make sure your camera's batteries are fully charged - you'll need them!The temple itself is a holy place so act respectfully - bare feet only and for heaven's sake ! - don't point the soles of your feet toward the Buddha; If you do a very polite security guard will come over and firmly correct your behavior.The Emerald Buddah itself is really quite small compared to all the ornamentation within the temple. Don't forget to take time to admire the murals on the walls. The theme's are quite similar to European court scenes (with a Thai twist) When we were there the monks were chanting, which added a more reverent feeling. Just sit down (on the floor) and quietly take it all in. Enjoy the lovely shade while you can because it's HOT outside! To avoid being pushed out (if it's crowded) sit down on the floor somewhere (watch where those feet are pointing!)"

It was very nice but not nearly as great as we had been led to believe, The statue was no more than three feet tall, elevated greatly from eye level, and it was difficult to get a close up. It was dressed in the winter clothes. While it is called the emerald Buddha, it is actually made of jadeite. There was a good space for prayer and making offerings. We enjoyed the visit but wish it hadn't been built up as much as it was."

However, there is a another museum within the palace that describes the different jewelries and clothing the Emerald Buddha is clothed when the season changes. The details of the Wat is beautifully decorated."

Despite many, many signs -- some having to be waved by personnel from the alter -- clearly showing/reading NO PHOTOGRAPHS, the number of rude people blatantly disregarding the sanctity of the temple was disappointing. The temple and Buddha were beautiful. The crowd was not."

They change his clothes depending on the season which is kinda cool. Also, your ticket includes admission to a museum...fairly interesting, but most important it's air conditioned! Ticket also includes admission to a park/area several minutes drive from this temple; not sure why as it's a bit inconvenient and I'd rather just pay for this.

The main building of the temple houses the Magnificient Statue of the Emrald Buddha , carved from a singlr piece of Jade. The legendary history of this Buddha image is traced to India, five centuries after the Lord Buddha attained Nirvana, till it was finally enshrined in Bangkok The Emerald Buddha, a dark green statue, is in a standing form, about 26 inches tall, carved from a single jade stone (Emerald in Thai means deep green colour and not the specific stone). Except for the Thai King, no other person is allowed to touch the statue. The King changes the cloak around the statue three times a year, corresponding to the summer, winter, and rainy seasons, an important ritual performed to usher good fortune to the country during each season. It is located within the Grand Palace of Bangkok on Na Phra Lan Road. It can be reached by more than 20 bus routs (A/c and Non A/c) from all over Bangkok. It is open from 8.30am till 3.30pm. You must take out your shoes and wear long trousers/skirts; long sleeve shirts covering your shoulders. Appropriate dress is available at the entrance of the temple free of charge, with refundable deposit. Entry is included in the Ticket of 400 Baht for Grand Palace. Photo of The Emrald Buddha Idol can be taken only from outside of the temple."

Try and visit as early as possible, since it gets very hot and difficult to walk around the temple.Also if you a normal tourist who is going along with packages it would cost you around 1100 Bhat per person, but if you could be a little smart, try and hire a taxi on meter rate basis (only on meter rates, it costed me 100 Bhat one side for 2 people) go their but tickets worth 400 Bhat per person, see the temple and come back and it would not cost you more then 1000 Bhat for 2 people."

The temple of the Emerald Buddha is linked to the Grand Palace and when most people say we must visit the Grand Palace this is what they have in mind. First getting there can be a nightmare if you go by road. Most taxi drivers do not speak English therefore get your hotel reception to write down where you want to go in Thai and show it to the taxi driver. Secondly the traffic in Bangkok is a nightmare any time of the day so be prepared to wait. The easiest way and the nicest is to take the Skytrain to Saphan Taksin stop, keep to the right when you get off and head towards the ferry terminal underneath the bridge. Here the local ferry taxi will take you along the river to the nearest stop by the Wat and Grand Palace. You may be asked to take a private ferry taxi and if you do bargain for the price. They always ask high but do not accept the first price they offer. The ferry takes you along the river and past the expensive hotels for about a 15 minute ride. When you get off you will see in front of you a white washed wall which is the perimeter fencing of the complex.Keep to the left to walk around the wall as this will take you on the shortest route to the entrance. Do not listen to anyone who tries to tell you that the complex is closed for lunch. This is just a scam to try and get you to waste your time and money in a restaurant across the road. The complex is open until 3.30pm every day. There is a dress code that is rigorously enforced (no shorts or bare shoulders). However inside the entrance you can hire (200 Baht deposit which you get back) long trousers which are clean and not ridiculous. Buy water before going in as you will be walking around in the hot sun. Photographers paradise as the buildings are very opulent. You cannot take photographs inside the Wat itself which holds the Emerald Buddha. A fascinating place to visit and of great attraction to locals as well as tourists."

It is a \"potent religio-political symbol and the palladium of Thai society\". It is located in the historic centre of Bangkok (district Phra Nakhon), within the precincts of the Grand Palace.The main building is the central ubosoth, which houses the statue of Emerald Buddha. The legendary history of this Buddha image is traced to India, five centuries after the Lord Buddha attained Nirvana, till it was finally enshrined in Bangkok at the Wat Phra Kaew temple in 1782 during Rama I's reign (1782?1809). This marked the beginning and raise of the Chakri Dynasty of the present Kingdom of Thailand (the present head of the dynasty is King Rama IX. The Emerald Buddha, a dark green statue, is in a standing form, about 66 centimetres (26 in) tall, carved from a single jade stone (Emerald in Thai means deep green colour and not the specific stone). It is carved in the meditating posture in the style of the Lanna school of the northern Thailand. Except for the Thai King, no other person is allowed to touch the statue. The King changes the cloak around the statue three times a year, corresponding to the summer, winter, and rainy seasons, an important ritual performed to usher good fortune to the country during each season.While legend traces this statue to India, its rich historical records dates its finding in Cambodia in the 15th century, moved to Laos in the 16th century and then to Vientiane where it remained for 215 years, and finally to Thailand in the 18th century. Considering the long history and Nagasena's (a Brahmin who became a Buddhist sage and lived about 150 BC) prophesy that the Emerald Buddha would bring \"prosperity and pre-eminence to each country in which it resides\", the Emerald Buddha deified in the Wat Phra Kaew is deeply revered and venerated in Thailand as the protector of the country."

Guys remember to wear LONG Trousers - ladies too or you will be refused admission by the trouser police. There is the option of hiring Pantaloons at the main entrance gate - not expensive but I ended up wearing bright orange and black ones - it didn`t bother me but it may not please others.I would give this tour a 10/10.

The architecture, the colours, everything about the place makes it very special and unique. The Temple of the Emerald Buddha was really lovely. The mother-of-pearl inlay is so intricate and thinking back to how old it was and how it must of been made and put together is just amazing. But all of the buildings are amazing.Allow yourself plenty of time to do this tour. It isn't something you can whizz through in 1-2 hours and really appreciate. We were there for nearly 3 hours and rushed the final buildings because it was coming up to closing time.Remember that you must have your shoulders and legs covered if you go here. Men cannot wear shorts - they need long pants. Similarly women need to cover up as well. There are places close by where you can hire or purchase appropriate clothing if needed."

I have been here a couple of times in the past and I was a bit surprised to see that they had raised the price to 400baht. Not alot of money, but it used to be around 200, so doubling it seemed a bit much. I have always been happy to pay as a foreigner, because the Thai people don't have to pay, but I don't know that I would do it again. I personally feel like Wat Po is just as nice and not as expensive. The grounds here are much bigger and the history is rich. A must to do first thing in the morning or you will be crushed by tour buses. We actually were there un knowingly during Thai holiday, so it is not fair to say, but there was literally 1000's of people fighting there way around the place. When you finally get to the emerald buddha it is a bit of a letdown after the Reclining Buddha image. I only mean to say this as a constructive view point. It is a fantastic image and the pure jade statue twinkles, however is is less than a meter tall and it is placed like 10 meters up on the alter, so by the time you view it, it is just a little buddha high up in the wat. Now to be fair, it is surrounded by several golden guilded buddhas and the imagery from that standpoint is a bit more impressive. Its probably a must see for a first timer to Thailand/BGK, but go early is my thought or just blow it off and check out the other 1000 Wat's instead."

I live in Bangkok and have been to the Wat Phra Kaeo countless times. Like most reviewers I think its a beautiful must-see temple in Bangkok.But, on my most recent trip with my young nieces I made a dicovery about its dress code and what it can cost: Its not sufficient for a woman or girl to be in a skirt/dress (length is not an issue) and with her arms and shoulders completely covered. The shoulders must be covered by a stiched garment (however short the sleeve!!!!)One of my nieces was in a decourous but sleevless collared T, but she had a HUGE and beautiful scarf that completely covered her shoulders and arms. The guards at the ticket collection point actually man-handled her, yanking her scarf off her and jabbed her (now bare) arm. Anywhere else this would be assault! My niece had the maturity and sense of humour to see it for what it was, pointing out to me that it was an odd sort of thing in a country where traditionally women did not wear stiched garmets :-)"

Don't agree on a price per person, agree on price for service."

Of course you have to queue up and fight the crowds to see this very unique complex and shrine but because of the crowds, I found the experience not very pleasant. Too many people inevitably shake up what would otherwise be a very peaceful and serene atmosphere.I also got e portable audio guide which was very helpful. Take a credit card with you to leave with them in exchange for the electronic guide (its that or your original passport, copies or driving license are not accepted).Beware as your walk around to find your way to the main entrance ( the complex is huge so depending on which direction you come from, you will likely have to walk around it) at you will find many people telling you that the temple is closed for some reason or the other and to save you the walk there and the disappointment, they wanted to inform you. They will then tell you about other sites to see instead and handily have a tuk tuk pull up to offer you a ride. Ignore all such BS. Watch your pockets and just make your way to the entrance. It's the biggest draw in BKK so it's always open."

It's a SCAm to get you to go to a shop \"to kill time\"...and they will make you go far on a tuktuk to a \"cheap jewellry store\" which is about \u00a3300 for the cheapest pair of earrings.

So I thought I'd make another journey as it wasn't far from Sukhumvit. The first thing was that we arrived at lunchtime and the temple was closed to foreigners, but not Thais, so we had to wait an hour and a half to be able to enter. Then we had to hire long trousers and leave a returnable deposit. No shorts or skirts allowed. Finally, the entrance fee was expensive for foreigners, but free for Thais, a Thai trait which always annoys me. But this isn't England, so you have to accept that foreigners are cash cows.We eventually got in and it was very hot and very crowded. It is a beautiful temple area with some impressive thai architecture and a stroll around is quite pleasant. This time I did manage to see the Emerald Buddha, perhaps significant religious-wise, but very disappointing otherwise. I had to look hard just to find it and then when I did, I couldn't take a photo.....I took my allowable photos and we headed for the exit, only to find it wasn't the one that we'd come in at and our 'long-pant' hirer was on the other side of the temple. The different hirers wouldn't accept each others trousers. When we did find the lady (make a note of what the hirer looks like and exactly where they are in relation to the entrance you choose) she rudely snatched the trousers off us and tossed the bahts back at us. To add further unpleasantness, all the taxi drivers increase their fares dramatically when heading away from the temple and would not barter at all. Be warned.So, I've done it and seen it twice and that is enough. I won't be going back. The temples are worth seeing, but the local thais are ruthless in their quest for a few bahts and also a few were unusually unpleasant and rude. There are nicer temples to visit which are equally impressive and have polite and friendly local thais."

A few minutes inside the temple was really peaceful.The only downside is that as a tourist, I got a feeling that we have been looked down upon. 400 baht for all 'foreigners' (as they have it on the sign boards) was downright expensive (while it was free for locals). Rubbing salt on wounds was that the 'foreigners' were not allowed to come in via the main entrances and were asked to walk all around the palace to exit which was downright silly and hard for folks especially with little children. No, I don't think Thai people are hospitable. Maybe they are just tired of tourists. On another note, Things like this don't happen in America. All tourists are treated with respect and are provided with basic conveniences no matter where they are in the USA. One more reason to be a proud American."

First impressions: From the outside, the ornate decorations and the intricate gold-green patterns of the temple's facade is like a wonderful gift-wrap containing an exquisitely beautiful gift inside.While the actual statue is made of jade and not emeralds, it attracts huge crowds who come to pay their respects to the memory of Buddha and his teachings. The tiny (between 60 and 75 cm) Emerald Buddha, is located high above the heads of the worshippers and tourists. The image is considered a talisman and holds tremendous significance for Thailand and the Thai people. The 'robe' that it wears is changed three times each year by the King himself at the start of each season: A diamond encrusted gold robe during the hot season, a solid gold robe in the cool season and a gilded monk's robe in the rainy season. So choose your season.Pros: This temple is part of a large complex of \"buildings\" inside the Grand Palace so you can hit all the attractions in one visit. Take the whole day. (And it is close to Wat Po, the Temple of the Reclining Buddha.) Although the lines getting in might be long, you can spend as much time inside as you want.Cons: Did I tell you about the crowds?! Come early. You are competing for space with both worshippers and tourists alike. Like in many temples, there is also a dress code. You do not want to come unprepared. As it is strictly forbidden to take pictures inside, you may want to take pictures of the statue outside from an open window. A telephoto lens would help (It is slightly dark inside and it's a small statue, after all).Verdict: One of the \"must see\" attractions in Bangkok. Highly recommended. Just come early and dress appropriately."

If you notice, Buddha immages, temple wall and pagodas in Thailand follow syle of Sukhothai, Ayuthaya and also Ankor style. But the Vihar (hall) of this temple decorated with ceramic pieces from China, the Khmer style pagoda decorated by pieces of China plates and bowls. The view of Chao Phraya River and the city from the top of the Pagoda is stunning. You may go at Sunset or Sunrise (not sure when it opens though). Giants are the gate keepers to this vihar, your children will love them as much as they will love the Chinese figures in the Vahar area. Visiting Wat Arun before the Emerald Buddha Temple will enhance the knowledge of those who are interested in history of early Krung Thep. The temples have the same architectural style and also decorated with items from China. It's just lovely, a fun temple for the family :) Climbing up the Pagoda is challenging. It's almost as high as climbing up a pagoda in Angkor Wat. I think this is a collective culture that should be promoted for the solidarity of the region and humankind :)"

Located on the grounds of the Grand Palace this Wat (Buddhist temple) is only one of the many temples and chedi (reliquary) at the Grand Palace. It holds a magnificient green jade Buddha (the emerald name was a 18th century transliteration mistake that has sadly stuck) and is the Royal and most revered Thai worship site. Wander around the grounds and see spectacular statues and chedi (also called stupa) and then, removing your shoes, enter the Wat Phra Kheow carefully avoiding stepping on the raised door frame (bad luck and in the old days boobytrapped). Even if you are not Buddhist show proper respect by staying low, crouch, do not disturb others, DO NOT TAKE PICTURES, and do not allow the soles of your feet to show towards the Buddha. Enjoy for a moment the jade Buddha and the extensive wall and ceiling pictures in the \"primitive\" art style.Remember before embarking on your visit that as this is a Royal Palace and grounds you will not be permitted to enter unless you are properly attired, no shorts, t-shirts, exposed shoulders or failing to cover your knees. A royal guide will greet you on entering the grounds to suggest appropriate dress if you don't meet their standards. These suggestions are law and you will note the fully-armed squad of Thai soldiers nearby. Take them seriously. And if you're not properly dressed you will be directly to a building providing you with cotton coverups."

Because of the heat; I would suggest visiting here first thing in the morning. If your hotel isn\u2019t too far you can return & change to shorts OR take a pair of shorts in your backpack. (visited Nov 08)"

A Guide will definitely help you to get up-close with the importance of this place. I found free Guide service in English every half an hour and utilized it. Its about 40 mins.I was told that i have to dress appropriately (as per temple rules) to enter inside and did so.

When I visited, foreigners had to wait until the top of the hour to get in while Thais were allowed immediate access. I wasn't concerned about that. Also, if you're a female, you will need to wear a long skirt to cover your legs. Men will need to wear long pants to do the same thing.

The Emerald Buddha image is extremely beautiful and the gold clothing the Buddha is dressed in is very elaborate and intricate. One thing to remember is that as this is a royal premises, you need to dress respectfully and long trousers are a must as you will not be allowed in wearing shorts etc. (for both male and female visitors) You will also need to remove your shoes before entering the temple."

Highlight was being able to sit down on the Temple floor in front of it and watch worshippers nd appreciate the whole temple interior. It was a peaceful and beautiful place. Only stress is ensuring you don't point your soles towards the statue which is very disrespectful. Also interesting is that the Buddha is \"dressed\" in different types of wraps depending on the season. A very worthwhile place to visit in Bangkok."

We had the best guide (provided at the Wat) and were awe struck. There were many artisans working various restoration projects and that was really cool to see. We did go inside the temple building that houses the Emerald Buddha. No cameras or photos are allowed... but, I have a nice zoom on my camera so, I was able to get a photo from outside of the building. LOL. Interesting fact: the Buddha's clothes are changed to match the season! Who would of thought?! Anyways, it is a must see. Expect to spend some time here.

The temple complex it's located in is also very spectacular with beautiful detail on the buildings. Make sure you dress appropriately - women must wear a skirt or dress, or full-length trousers, men must wear shorts than cover the knees, and everyone must have covered shoulders. You should actually follow this dress code in all temples (women can get away with long shorts everywhere but at this one, never short shorts though), but it will be enforced here. If you forget, you can hire clothing inside the entrance. Don't get the overpriced stuff from the vendors on the street outside."

If you want to add one more hour or so, Wat Arun is on the opposite side of the river across from the Grand Place. You can take a ferry from Tha Chang to get there. 2. You can avoid the traffic by taking the BTS to Sapan Taksin and then get off and go down to the water's edge to take a cheap boat ride (great scenic views) to Tha Chang. This will put you behind the Grand Palace and Wat Pho and right across from Wat Arun. (Take a ferry across the river to Wat Arun. Ignore the touts who will try to get you to buy their boat service rather than the very cheap ferry service that the locals use.) 3. The City Shrine where you can see the city's pillar is just across the street and to the left of the Grand Palace. This attraction is free. 4. Make sure you wear formal clothes and that your feet are covered or Thai guards will not allow you in as you are. There are clothes to \"borrow\" but other tourists have worn them before you. However, bring lose fitting shoes that will properly cover your feet because you will have to take your shoes off to go inside most of the buildings there.5. Take your picture with the elaborately dressed guards who have to stand at attention at various places. The locals do it so so can you. 6. You will get a coupon to go and visit the Teak Palace so make sure you visit the temples in the morning and then hail a taxi to head over to \"We-wan-make\" to see the world's largest teak palace for free. The teak palace will close around four or so and is definitely worth the visit."

And don't bother bringing a sarong as I did, this is the only shrine/temple where the sarong was not good enought to cover my shoulders.

The sun ray that shining on BKK almost the entire year is really helpful to create that goldie blink blink looks. Entrance fee is 400 baht for foreigners per May 2012 (free for local Thai). Bit pricey than other attractions. U can find green emerald Buddha in this place too. Make sure u see it properly because it is mounted high on top of the altar and the statue is not that big as expected. Located near Tha Chang pier. Always take 'orange flag' boat for flat fee of 15 baht only to any piers. Easy to remember n no need to think about other boat with different flag or taking more expensive tourist boat."

Definitely a sight to see....although I would highly recommend visiting the Wat Pho, as well. I preferred the Wat Pho to the Wat Phra - less touristy, and a big quieter and more serene.

The Buddha has a rich history in Thai culture the Royal family changes its vestments every season. Originally from the Lana kingdom up north this Buddhas original home was in Chiang Rai. If you ever wanted to see the Emerald Buddha up close there is an exact replica in Chiang Mai <The Wat has the same name>. It was replaced by the Chinese community when the original was moved to Bangkok. One of the great things I like about this Wat is the Buddhist mural that runs along the entire length of the Wat. I think it is one of the longest in the world <Angkor Wat being the longest>. It delves into the rich tradition of Buddhist theology and is full of all kinds of colorful images. When you visit the Emerald Buddha please remember to show utmost respect for this site. Remove your shoes, Don't talk loudly, don't take pictures inside and whatever you do Do not point your feet at the image this is considered disrespectful."

This temple is located in the middle of the Grand Palace, and is not a site in itself, but rather viewed as the highlight of the grand palace visit.The grand palace is, in my opinion, the no. 1 site in Bangkok. A must see for every tourist visiting Bangkok. The best part of the palace that is worth visiting is the temple of the Emerald Buddha.Important to note \u2013 come to the palace wearing long pants and skirts, or else you will need to rent covering from a booth inside the palace entrance (or from one of the vendors outside \u2013 But I recommend to do it inside).The palace is best seen with a tour guide. A one hour tour is not expensive (400 baht). I suggest going to the tourist information office, next to the ticket booth (they are very friendly) and have them recommend a guide. The guides await at the entrance to the palace, and the ticket booth is inside, but the walk back and forth is worthwhile to get a good guide. Allow at least 1.5 hours for a visit of the palace. It takes about 1 hour to see the temple, and another 20 minutes to wander outside around the other buildings of the palace, which are closed to the public.The temple itself is not big, and photography is not allowed inside (this is strictly enforced by a guard standing inside forbidding photography and ensuring that photographs taken are deleted.). You can attempt to photograph the emerald Buddha through the window, but better have yourself photographed there by someone standing on the outside."

I understand that it is a very holy Buddha but as a tourist site it is not incredibly impressive.

Men should be in trousers or full pants and cannot be wearing sleeveless shirts. Women no skirts/tights or sleeveless tops. They will not let you go in if you are not properly dressed. You will have to borrow clothing from the counter at the entrance if you are not properly dressed.If you are well versed with hindu history especially the ramayana then you need not take a guide else guide is helpful. The architecture has 3 influences i.e thai, combodian and indonesian. The royal palace is located in the same compound but you can see only a part of it."

The first item that rubbed me the wrong way was the admission fee. 400 Baht per person seems to be an outlandish amount of money in the Thai culture to view the temple and grounds. The average Thai makes 400 Baht a day, so they are essentially charging a full day's labor to get in, which is probably why admission is free for those who are Thai.There is a lot of history surrounding the emerald Buddha from its inception to its travels amongst India, Sri Lanka, Cambodia, etc. Needless to say, you could spend a bunch of time just reading about the story behind the emerald Buddha. However, when you see it in person, it is quite small and rather unassuming. If you see the reclining Buddha first, you will be left wondering why there is a lot of hype surrounding the emerald Buddha.The grounds and building surrounding the emerald Buddha are very decorative and impressive. I unfortunately did not go on a guided tour of the grounds (lots of folks standing outside offering tours for money and then there are 4 free tours in English every day). I think you would probably need to go on a tour to understand all the details and history of the buildings.All that to say, I left feeling like it was an overpriced tourist trap. However, it is one of those things that you kind of need to see, so that you can check the box. There are a lot of other temples that are far cheaper and just as impressive, however, they do not have the famous emerald buddha."

Of course you will want to see the Emerald Buddha...but make sure to pay attention to the elegant and beautiful apsonsis on the upper tier, and make funny faces and arm positions to mimic the ramakien figures....have your picture taken doing this..it is tradition!

Our driver demanded a huge port fee at the last minutes which we paid and found out from other groups that there is none. So beware. Local taxi drivers i.e. waved down by the road side do not understand English and therefore it is better to make arrangment beforehand to keep the car for the whole site visits.The Temple of Emerald Buddha compound is huge and so much to see. Do allow for more than an hour to cover the numerous places inside.Visitors must not wear shorts and guys who did so bought sarong on the spot to wrap around the waist. - the only alternative.

The day we were there you really had to jostle to make your way inside. The temple is attractive enough, though there are plenty of attractive temples in Bangkok, but the real disappointment was the Emerald Buddha itself. It was sitting up very high and far back, and it's actually surprisingly small. So after all you've heard about it, and after the effort of getting inside to look at it, it's just not much to see. If you want to see a cool Buddha I'd recommend the Reclining Buddha or the Golden Buddha, both of which were far more impressive and far more pleasant to visit."

We arrived in the morning only to find the palace was closed for an official function, so negotiated a 2 hour round trip to the Golden Mountain, and the Wat In (with a 32 metre high Buddha), as well as two shops. Cost 20 baht. Anyway... when we arrived, the Wat Phra Kaeo was worth the fee and the wait. As I said, it is Thailand's most holy religious site and as such is filled at all times with people praying. The Buddha is small, but beautifully formed in so far as one can see, The temple itself is worth spending a good time to look at, as are the surrounding buildings.the Royal Palace, on the other hand was something of a disappointment. One major building was closed - under repair, and another was closed for a function. But nothing could detract from the Wat. A must see, NB knees AND ankles MUST be covered to gain admittance, and no exceptions are made. If you arrive improperly dressed you can rent suitable clothing for a monstrously inflated price.

Wat Phrasrirattana Sasadaram (Wat Phra Kaeo), or the Temple of the Emerald Buddha, situated within the Grand Palace, near Sanam Luang, is a sacred symbol of the Rattanakosin, or Bangkok, Dyansty and the most important temple in realm. It was built by King Rama I, the founder of the Chakri Dynasty, at the same time as the Grand Palace in 1782, when he established Bangkok as his capital, in order to serve as the palace chapel, in which traditional royal ceremonies would be conducted. It thus has a sanctuary for the performance of Buddhist rites, but no residences for monks.The temple is richly endowed with fine art and architecture. The Emerald Buddha image is enshrined in the phra ubosot, the exterior walls of which are covered with beautiful designs in gold leaf and glass, while the interior walls bear murals depicting the life of Buddha and other subjects.The phra mondop, or library, is set on a high base surmounted by a stepped pyramid. Inside is reserved a chest containing the Tripitaka, the Buddhist sacred scripture.The Royal Pantheon, or Prasat Thepbidon, has a high spire. Inside are enshrined statures of the eight previous kings of the Chakri Dynasty.Next to phra mondop is a miniature replica of Angor Wat, which King Rama IV had constructed.The walls of the cloister are decorated with murals showing scenes from the Ramakian, the Thai version of the Ramayana. These were originally painted during the reign of King Rama I and have been restored several times."

This was our fourth visit to The Grand Palace and the only time I felt that we really walked away with a good understanding and appreciation for it. We planned on doing the the audio tour but ended up hiring an official palace guide instead. The audio tour costs 200 baht per person and the guide's cost was 600 baht. We had 4 people in our group so we decided to go with the guide. This guide was hired inside the palace gates (not outside) and was wearing an official name tag. (Khun Tui was his name and you could ask for him personally just outside the door where you would rent clothing). The tour was fairly comprehensive for a day visit (just under two hours total). The only down side was that we felt just a bit rushed to go on with the tour, just remember that this is a private tour and go at your own pace. The tour includes two different sections of the palace, once you leave the first section, you cannot go back! Your guide will tell you this as well and give you extra time for photos if you need it. We started out tour at 2 p.m. and by 4:00 p.m. (around closing time) the crowds were gone and we could enjoy ourselves more. I liked that I could ask questions and get answers where as with the audio tour you cannot and without either you're just reading out of a book the whole time or not learning anything. FYI: If you finish the Grand Palace just before closing, head over to Wat Pho which is open until 6 or 7 and you will pretty much have the place to your self. See my review on Wat Pho for more info on that!"

Take BTS and stop at Saphan Taksin, take exit 2 to central pier, take Chao Phraya Express boat & get off at Maharaj Pier which is the closest one to Grand Palace. Please note that most info available on the internet says to get off at Tha Tien Pier (N8) or Tha Chang Pier (N9), however the staff at Chao Phraya Express boat explains that Maharaj Pier is the closest, they're right. Once I got off at Maharaj Pier, I was lucky there were so many tourists too, I just followed their ways, LOL."

But after the first 20, they start to get a little boring.So Wat Phra Kaew is the exception... It's vast, interesting and breathtaking. There's so many incredible works of art here you can easily spend more than half a day wandering around the grounds.Entrance is 200 baht (I think) unless you are a Thai Buddhist. I recommend getting the tour guide, which is a little recorded tour that leads you around and provides information on what you are seeing.Also the Grand Palace is connected to the temple, so you get to visit both places AND there's a bonus as the entrance fee includes entrance to the Vimanmek Teak Mansion.Two important things to note...1 Wear appropriate clothes for visiting an important religious building.and2 DO NOT LISTEN TO THE PEOPLE WHO TELL YOU IT'S CLOSED!!! As you walk towards the temple, well-dressed, polite Thais will inform you that today is a Buddhist holiday or an election or construction work being carried out... blah blah blah... They are lying.... YOU ARE ABOUT TO BE SCAMMED.This happens all day, every day, right in front of the police and temple authorities. Ignore them. Don't worry about offending them, smile and say, \"OK Thanks\" and keep walking... Check it yourself. I've never seen it closed.If you stop and talk to the scammers, you will be taken by tuk tuk to a gem shop, or a scummy temple, or a tailors, or a boat ride... All of which will waste your holiday time and almost certainly cost you money.It's a blight on Thailand and one which needs addressing, but if the Thai government won't do anything about it, YOU have to make sure you don't fall prey to them. If the scammers didn't make money out of it, they'd give up and get a proper job."

Maybe, but their real intention is to take you to a shop where drivers can get commissions through gas coupons.

WIthin the wat is \"Bot\" Phra Kaeo, housing the emerald buddha, its center piece. Outside Bot Phra Kaeo, scattered throughout the grounds are a maze of religious buildings/structures along with an army of magical, mystical figures guarding and protecting the sacred grounds. Extensive portico's displaying complex Ramakien murals surround the grounds. It is a beautifully designed and maintained and is a serious destination worth serious study before visiting. The cacophony and complexities of modern life lie just outside. It's at this spot, one begins to reflect on how Thai's so comfortably marry and integrate ancient religious traditions with modern life. Paradoxes of past and present coalesce providing a deeper, richer understanding of today's Thailand.Proper dress is to be observed. (nagging) Guides are available at the entrance and likely worht hiring. Foreigner's pay entrance fees while Thai's rigthfully have free entrance."

Like others have said (and like we read in our guidebook), beware of touts outside the complex telling you it is closed. Our taxi dropped us off right outside the entrance (well, just behind it so that we couldn't quite see that that was it) and a man immediately told us that was not the entrance and to walk about two hundred yards to another entrance. We looked at him like \"What are you talking about?\" He kept pushing us in that direction, claiming he was security (dressed in plain clothes? Ha! Yeah, right!). So we walk down to the other \"entrance\" only to be met by other men who told us the palace was closed because it was a Thai Buddha holiday. UGH! We knew we'd been had and walked back to the first entrance and got in just fine. It just makes you so mad that people will blatantly lie to you when you are just trying to enjoy your vacation.It was the most expensive place we visited at 400 baht per person. But the complex is massive and there is so much to see. It was very hot, even here toward the end of November, and the sun was unrelenting. Which can make the throngs of people all vying to snap the same picture you are a little frustrating. But relax and enjoy it! There are plenty of shaded places to take refuge :) We only wish we could go in the beautiful buildings. You can go inside the Bot of the Emerald Buddha, but you can't take pictures! Oh well. Still a very worthwhile way to spend a couple of hours."

At 400 bahts per person, It is the most expensive attraction site in Bangkok but well worth it. (wat pho and wat arun are 50 bahts each and are must see). Everyone is required to cover up their bodies before entering. They will rent you different articles of clothing (each at 200 baht refunded upon return of the clothes). At first it\u2019s difficult to realize how big this place it. At one point I asked myself why was it called the grand palace? it isn\u2019t so grand after all! but I was wrong. This thing goes on forever. It is worth noting that is very easy to miss the emerald Buddha even if you are in the grand palace. I missed it. a) I didn\u2019t know that the emerald Buddha was in the grand palace and b) there was little to no sign with good direction. This is one place to exhaust your camera's battery. I did! you may want to make sure its super charged before you go there or bring a spare. You might need it. Make sure your memory card has plenty space on it as well, it will be a shame to have to delete other pictures.One last but important thing to note is that there are people standing around the palace saying that it is closed and offering to take you to another destination. BEWARE.... the palace closes at 4pm. I was told by tuk tuk men and other people that I shouldn\u2019t bother with the palace because it wasn\u2019t opened. Big lie, I got to the palace and walked right in and once i got to the real official workers I was told they close at 4pm. Too many people in Bangkok will readily lie to you to get your money. I'M SORRY TO SAY BUT THERE ARE NO GOOD SAMARITANS AROUND THE BIG SITES IN BANGKOK.Overall, this place is impressive and I highly recommend it. I will post pictures ASAP."

Magnificent, colorful, opulent, serene, exquisitely detailed, words are not enough to describe it, this is just one of those places you must have seen to believe it. So many details, statues, wall paintings, spires, giant guardians and of course the piece de resistance: The emerald Buddha. Take at least 2 hours to be able to see everything, and an hour more if you want to take in all the sights in detail. Keep in mind that the temple and palace close at 3:30 pm! Also: to save time, make sure you're dressed properly (shoulders, legs and feet fully covered and no cleavage) or you'll be redirected to the long line at the \"dressing room\" where you'll be issued with a loaner sarong, scarf or long pants.Once inside, there are enough options to get some help and explanation along the way. - First option is to just pay the entry fee (400 THB) and walk around with the help of the provided brochure.- Second option is to hire a guide (prices vary) who will happily take you around. BEWARE: only take a guide if he's waiting close to the ticket booth (well inside the palace grounds). The ones outside of the main gate with the photo folders are usually too expensive and will try to rush you through the grounds. Don't be scammed into buying tickets from them or them telling you you need a different entrance.- Third option is to hire an audio-guide (200 THB for 2 hours, credit card or passport needed as deposit) that will tell you about all the sights in a language of your choice. If you're solo or with just two, this is probably the best buy.With all these tips in mind, bring your photocamera or handycam along and marvel at the splendour of the temple grounds and the Grand Palace. It's not just the Emerald Buddha you want to see, check out all the different Guardian Giants and what's probably the biggest comic book in history, painted along the entire inside of the temple's outer walls."

It is not big to start with and it is situated a good distance from the spectators so it is hard to get a good view to it. What is far more impressing is decoration around the statue and the building around it which is vastly decorated and the direct surrounding which reveal tons of mythological and architectural findings. The other thing is that especially for Thai this is a most sacred place and you can learn a lot about their religion as well. There are some things which I noted on my visit which might be useful.The first thing os to dress properly, this is a holy place so long trousers for men are a must and decent wardrobe for women as well (no bare knees for example). The second thing is to drop off your shoes before you enter and to never put the soles of your feet into the direction of the Buddha. And lastly, photography is strictly forbidden inside the temple (though not strictly enforced). As a part of the whole grand palace it would be a shame to miss it."

So much has been written about this incredible place, but I would like to give a few key tips which made my visit here memorable. As crowds are large and intense (and LOUD), I most strongly recommend arriving at the site as early as possible, even BEFORE it opens and be the first one inside the gates. When you enter, go straight fo the Emerald Buddha...so that you can experience it in utter silence. I will not reveal my own experience, but let us say that amidst all the grandiose and bravura of many of the sites, the utter modesty and grace of Emerald Buddha deeply moved me. But it must be experienced in silence! Likewise for most of the site complex.....You will experience the stark contrast an hour or two later when droves of tourists arrive, and like cackling chickens (plus our new Western nemesis: cellphones) give an intrusive ambience. When this happens, I suggest moving on to the Wat Poh massage area, and if you are lucky, you can strike up a conversation with one of the local monks---or treat yourself to a classic Thai massage. Highly recommended--at the right time of day!"

I think this place can be very crowded but it was not so bad in the early morning, we started about 9am. At the entrance, a brochure with write ups and detailed map is given (available in few languages).The main attraction is of course the Emerald Buddha, which is quite small in size but it sits high up on the altar, and looks really majestic. Please take off your footwear (as in all other temples).Do go around the walls from the entrance, as the wall paintings are really nice. I believe restoration work was done recently.

This will enable enough time to see all of the attractions using the one ticket (NB: The teakwood mansion can be done on another day with paying for another ticket.). As I have seen Wats from all over SE Asia the whole affair only took me 2-3 hours, but you could easily spend a whole day. The amount of intricate detail and the vast array of structures and statues on offer to see could take more time than anticipated.As for this actual wat and it's emerald Buddha, it is very pretty and usually very congested with people. No shoes and no photography or video footage is permitted inside, however you can get a photo shot from outside - though dodging the unsuspecting and downright rude people is hard and can be time consuming. A decent zoom and lens is required to get a good shot (Mine is only from an Olympic 850 waterproof camera, so only very average.)It is a must see, but I found there was more hype to it than a spectacular wow factor. Nonetheless it is very pretty as to it's environment and the outside building and it's surrounds. (Lots of gold, shiny and glittery colours etc) Also the crowd was quite substantial and had to be endured which can lessen the enjoyment factor. Therefore, to me it's a \"been there, done that\" attraction and would only revisit if I was travelling with someone who hasn't see it, and they wished to."

The ticket that lets you into both Wat Phra Kaeo and the Grand Palace also gets you in (but only on the same day, so start early) to see a tour of the Teak Palace near Dusit Zoo, some considerable distance away. Even without that, however, the 350 Bhat admission price is worth it. In fact, add another 200 TBh and rent the audio-guide rather than joining a huge group tour with a guide leading you around. That way you can dawdle gawking at things that most appeal to you rather than following the timing someone else prefers. It's hard to know how to begin to describe the incredible excess that is shown in this Temple complex. The Emerald Buddha (perhaps the most revered in all of Thailand) is housed here, and each Rama (King of Thailand) over the years has added yet a new grandiose feature to the surrounding area. (One, for example, built a scale model of Angkor Wat near Siem Reap in Cambodia in this complex.) The result really is incredible, with new features to see around each corner you turn. If you are a photographer, however, the hardest part of your photography is likely to be finding a time to take a picture of your favorite figure that does not have other tourists mugging for photos in front of it. Getting there when the place first opens might be worth a try, but a few hundred other people are likely to have much the same idea. Still, it seemed to get worse close to noontime when I was there, so an early start is still advisable. Really, though, do spring for that audioguide. When they say that if you go beyond the 2 hour limit to return it you will be charged another 200 Bhat, that two hours sounds short, but you can probably do all you want in that time. Much of the space of the area of the tour is taken up by the Grand Palace. There you are pretty much restricted to looking from the outside (unless you want to spend time in the \"weapons museum\") so the last part of your tour goes pretty quickly. Dawdle in the Wat where there's wonder around every corner, then move more quickly through the Grand Palace."

Along with how it's all maintained - from the extensive gold leaf to unending mosaics - it's truly a gorgeous labour of love.The story of how the Buddha was found to where it is as a showpiece today is pretty incredible. Each year, the King visits 4x and changes the raiment according to the seasons.And although called Emerald - this refers to colour only - the Buddha is made from Jade.No photos can be taken inside the temple but it's still easy to get a good pic from outside through the windows.

            "review": "It was Okay, Exhausted. Okay, I guess its one of those thigs to do in Bangkok, like see the Eiffel Tower in Paris but there wasn't anything spectacular about it for me. It seems very commerical unlike other temples in Asia. For example, the Kandy Temple in Sri Lanka (where the Buddha's tooth relic is) had a real feeling that it was being used as a temple, lots of monks, lots incense, lots of worshipers etc. At the Grand Palace, it was just a bit touristy and lots of buildings with nothing amazing to look at inside them.It is nice however, one can get over it very quickly. Go during the early morning as I went at about 1230 and it was very very hot and uncomfortable.It is 350 Bhat entrance fee. I wouldn't waist money on a tour guide as there isn't much to talk about and the people I looked at on lots of different tours weren't really all that interested in the guides. I think they just wanted to get into the shade and take photos."

            "review": "A Must See in Bangkok - Spectacular.. The Temple of the Emerald Buddha is part of the Royal Palace complex in old town Bangkok, so if you see one you'll see the other. Make sure to make it a stop on your itinerary - it is glittering gold and spectacular. The Emerald Buddha Temple is the holiest temple in Thailand, and you will see Thai people doing offerings here and praying to the Buddha. The buddha image itself is small, but sits atop a magnificent golden throne - it is really amazing. The surrounding buildings and complex are also incredible. Your trip will be enhanced by using a guide who can explain to you the importance of the structures, their meanings, and the history of the Emerald Buddha and Thai Buddhism. Without a guide, they are just a lot of beautiful buildings - still cool to see, but you won't have the same understanding and appreciation of the significance of this site. At the very least, there is a museum in the complex so you can read a few signs about it."

            "review": "Amazing!!. We went to the Grande Palace. During the Lent period 7th July 2009. what an amazing place. Wat Phra Si Rattanasasadaram, generally called the Temple of the Emerald Buddha, is a temple purpose-built to house a Buddha image carved from a large solid piece of green jadite (jasper). Chaophraya Chakri, who went on to become King Rama I, brought the image from Vientiane when he captured the city in 1778. King Rama I built the temple and enshrined the Emerald Buddha there as a symbol of Siam's regained nationhood. To enter this area you have to take your shoes off and store them in shoe cases outside. It is very important that when you visit the temples you are correctly dressed eg no shorts, bare shoulders and low cut tops. It is a sacred area and must be respected. You are not allowed to film or take pictures inside the enclosed area where the Emerald Buddha sits. It is such a calm, detailed, beautiful area and a must see when visiting Bangkok."

            "review": "Wonderful Place to Visit. We started at the Grand Palace and Wat Phra Kaew - Temple of the Emerald Buddha, which was a very short walk from the pier. We visited with Get - one of the guides from Tour with Tong. Entrance was 350 Baht / person, but there is no charge for the guide (there was no charge for the guides at any of the sites either). Both were spectacular in terms of colors, the intricacy of designs and the amount of gold used. We were lucky enough to explore these sights on a clear day and the photos turned out beautifully! It was great to explore with a guide because it allowed us to ask questions and understand what we were seeing. It was also interesting to see the ongoing restorations required to keep everything looking new and fresh. The murals on the walls were beautiful, and Get was able to help us understand the story from the Ramakien that was illustrated. That part was definitely something we would have missed on our own. The other part that we probably would have missed without her guidance was the Wat Phra Kaeo Museum. It gives you a much better understanding of how the temple and palace have changed over the years, as well as the number of restorations. It\u2019s definitely worth a few minutes to explore."

            "review": "Dazzling!. This temple is a huge incredible riot of glittering gold and color. Pictures on the internet cannot do it justice. Definitely a must-see in Bangkok. I think admission was 200 bahts (free for Thais) and that includes tickets to the Vimanmek Mansion and Abhisek Dusit Throne Hall (in the Duist area of Bangkok near the zoo - I can't comment on these however since we ran out of time.), as well as the next-door Grand Palace (but you can't go inside)."

On the third day it finally came to it, and I wouldn't have missed it for the world. I found that sightseeing in Bangkok was not at all as I thought it would be. You can make schedules all you want of were to go and when, but I bet you wind up being somewhere else and loving it. I'm glad to have visited the Palace and Wat Phra Kaeo at the end of my trip to BKK, because it was the icing on my cake. There's glitter and gold everywhere you look, you can't even imagine if you haven't seen it with your own eyes. There's a million details not to be overlooked. It's grand! The temple of the emerald Buddha (Wat Phra Kaeo) itself is very beautiful and peaceful. The Royal Palace is around the corner, not as splendid, but worth the time to visit while you're there anyway..."

Part of visiting the Grand Palace is seeing the emerald buddha definately worth visiting but nothing exceptional in itself, although the number of tourists would seem to suggest otherwise. Lots of Thai people seem to be on a pilgrimage to see it and your not supposed to take a photo inside the temple - of course theirs always one!"
