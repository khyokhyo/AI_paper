The buildings are gorgeous with vibrant colours and carvings. The highlight of the visit was taking heaps of photos and selfies with the big budda. The view is beautiful from the hill when the budda sits. Our guide was very informative about the monastery and the background of the budda. A must see if in Hong Kong!"

There are many people there paying their respects to the dead and incense abounds. The buildings are elaborate and colorful with lots of symbolic icons and paintings. There are three places to eat: a cafe, a VIP restaurant and a regular restaurant. All serve delicious vegetarian food."

Although there were a lot of people visiting that day the place had a serenity about it, We got there by cable car that takes about 25 mins and affords excellent views of the airport and the countryside. I have a fear of heights but I was OK because we didn't have the crystal cable car so our floor wasn't glass. The big Buddha Statue is magnificent and if you are feeling fit you can climb the stairs to get a closer look. The monastery is noted for it's vegetarian food although we didn't try it it may be worth looking into. There are quite a few tourist type shops and some eating places where you get off the cable car. If you have a free half day then I would certainly recommend a trip to Po Lin monastery. You can catch a train from Kowloon."

There was a short line for the cable car tickets (which we could have avoided if we had gone with a tour) but the wait gave us a chance to review the various ticket options. The cable car ride in the transparent botttom car was outstanding. The view of the airport and dense greenery on the hills and then over the water - every minute of the ride is worth it. One can spot the Buddha in the distance and its a mesmerizing sight! We spent time leisurely in the shopping arcade, resto/cafes and the gardens around the monastery before climbing the steps to the Buddha. Enjoy the tranquility and try to ignore the hoards of tourists clicking photographs endlessly. While returning, we stopped at the Citygate mall for outlets shopping and dining before heading back to the city.Excellent day trip!"

Climbing to the giant Buddha got the heart pumping but it's an impressive sight. Good views from the top as you expect.Plaza below had places to buy incense sticks and ice cream\\souvenirs etc. Was v reasonably priced.The main temple itself is beautiful. The ball of 10000 buddhas is truly amazing and in stark contrast to the outside world. You can buy meal tickets which I must admit we did t fully understand. Plenty of people saying though. Walked the 'fun' and 'wisdom' paths on the way to the yha. I preferred the wisdom as it takes you to the sculpture of wood. Word of warning though we were bitten multiple times in v short period of time. The but spray is a must here!"

The cable car, Ngong Ping Village, Po Lin and Tian Tan Buddha are all separate and deserve individual reviews. Po Lin Monastery was an experience I will carry with me for years to come. I would highly recommend Po Lin and Tian Tan Buddha if you have any amount of time in Hong Kong, to include a lengthy layover at HKG. I am not a religious person, but even I found myself moved by the natural and manmade beauty that is Po Lin Monastery and the surrounding grounds. I visited during a three day trip to Hong Kong, dedicating a Tuesday morning to the Ngong Ping total experience. At noon on this particular weekday, the crowds were non-existent and the morning drizzle / fog cover only added to my enlightened experience. Give yourself at least two hours just to wander the grounds without specifically visiting any number of temples or the monastery. For a small donation, visitors are offered a snack or meal to visit Tian Tan Buddha interior and eat at Po Lin Monastery. I opted for the snack and was pleasantly surprised at the food selections offered. There are also numerous dogs that call Po Lin Monastery home. Having recently lost my two dogs, I found one in particular to shadow me for part of the visit. I took it as a sign that things will be ok, and that was something I needed.The colors and architecture of Po Lin Monastery are incredible. I wish I would have spent more time here, or researched more specifically on the grounds. I would return for a second visit and highly recommend for anyone religious or not to spend time here. It was a moving experience and I thank everyone for their hospitality there."

As part of a 3 day stop-over in Hong Kong it made sense to get out of the hotel and explore some of the more popular tourist destinations that Hong Kong had to offer and it can be argued that the best views lie outside the city.On a cable car trip to the top of the mountain you really get a sense of perspective as to how small you really are compared to the acres of skyscrapers, trees and mountains. It is recommended that you go to look at the Buddha first as once you climb the stairs you are able to go inside the statue and view the precious artefacts and scriptures of Buddhism as well as one of the sacred artefacts of the religion, truly mesmerising stuff. Here there is a gift shop of sorts with all profits going towards the temple. You are also offered to buy a food token before climbing the stairs which for the equivalent of \u00a33 entitles you to 2 dumpling, noodles and a cup of Chinese tea over at the cafe in the Monastry all vegetarian of course. You'll also notice the seemingly hundreds of 'wild dogs' running around in the Monastry grounds which I found in fact that they are actually cared for by the temple and the temple itself is something to behold. Photography is prohibited in certain areas but the sights you will see are truly something else."

The site is easy to get to and although there are lots of tourists it is also very much being used. There are lots of people there to worship and the incense can be a little overwhelming.The buildings are beautiful and the vegetarian restaurant we found to be really good, although some of the desserts were a little odd.Combined with the cable car, bug buddha and Tai-O this is a lovely day out of the city."

            "review": "Monastery is a \"Must\". This is on everyone's \"to do\" list when visiting Hong Kong. The monastery is classical old Chinese architecture and it provides great views of the Big Buddha in the distance, which you will visit on the way. The icons (or \"graven images\") are quite impressive and you will see many people bowing and praying, as well as leaving gifts to the Buddha like fruit and a jar of Kirkland mixed nuts. While the reviews of the vegetarian dining room seem to receive good reviews, I didn't experience that. It's a walk-up-to-order \"window\" and seat yourself patio area. The food we saw coming out looked sub-standard and we chose to eat our own back-up provisions. Also, bathrooms are limited and the female bathroom features the \"squat hole\". This was surprising given the Village and Buddha are contemporary versus old China (note my tripadvisor name- I'll critique it all!) This is worth the 1/2 day trip as long as you are prepared. Manage your expectations: 1- Walking through Ngong Ping Village is like walking through Main Street Disney. I found this interesting given this is where some go to worship and the fact that this is a monastery. 2- the incense near and in the monastery is really bad. My friend has asthma and prepared by bringing a mask. She needed it in some areas. Tips: 1- buy your ticket before you leave the airport! This gives you a \"fast pass\" in the line if you're taking the cable 360 car. 2 - go early! It's easily a half day visit for both the Buddha and the monastery. if you start at 10:00. 3- wear comfy shoes. It's a lot of walking."

The monastery is a Chinese style building located behind a large courtyard with an incense burner in front of it. The recently completed Grand Hall of Thousand Buddhas is very beautiful with chinese carvings on the pillars and walls and Buddha statues inside. Entrance to the monastery is through a big chinese style gate with a circular platform in front of it. After this is a long walk where you can buy candles and incense sticks for offering to the Buddha in front of the monastery.The monastery also offers Vegetarian Lunch which is required if you want to visit the museum at the Big Buddha.A must see along with the Big Buddha nearby."

It was about a one hour drive to the cable car that takes you to the Island (near the airport). If the weather is nice, the views are fantastic. Our guide Lawrence was the best and covered all the history and took very good care of the group. The Buddha is a must see. We had a vegetarian lunch at the Po Lin Monastery. After that, the tour went down to the coast of the South China Sea and we took a boat tour to see the White Dolphins and houses on stilts. The White Dolphins were awesome as were the houses on stilts. Definitely recommend this tour. Not only was it a very good time but it gets you away from the crowds of Hong Kong for a day."

After climbing to big Buddha, there are some snack shops/stalls where you can grab a drink if you want. Then head back down and you can eat in the canteen or the vegetarian restaurant. I ate from the canteen shop which comes with the ticket so no charge, my selection of food included fried noodles, spring rolls, and turnip cake.

The weather and day meant that the queue was minimal. I have previously been and given up at the sight of the long queue on a fine weekend. The able car ride was magnificent with great views over the countryside, old Tung Chung village, the airport and coastline. At Ngng Ping village at the top of the cable car, a quaint collection of recreated / imagined old buildings with shops, cafes and attractions, we had some great photo ops. Then we walked on to the Big Buddha. There is a major flight of stairs to climb to get close to the Buddha, but these were easily managed by the four people in our party aged over 60. At the top the views were great as the mist cleared. The Buddha itself and surrounding statuary is beautiful and serene despit it's modern creation. From there we walked down to the Monastery near the base of the stairs. We passed statues of various characters from the Chinese zodiac / mythology on the way and several mild cattle sitting around being photographed (these appeared to be all male and missing certain parts of their anatomy which might explain their calmness). The Monastery is a collection of lovely buildings many with accommodation or administrative functions but artistically built. The prayer halls with statues of the Buddha were beautifully decorated with lots of golds, orange and yellows. In the grounds there's a joss stick burning area and a small, blackened building where people were burning their paper offerings (paper money, paper gold, paper clothing etc) and reading out the names of ancestors for whom these offerings were intended in the afterlife. We ate some vegetarian snacks from the Deli Vegetarian Cafe and found the desserts particularly enjoyable. Then we caught a bus from the bus terminus down to Mui Wo, another interesting excursion and from there we went by ferry to Central after a great meal in a seaside restaurant. A great day out. Snack places, refreshment places, washroom availability all good. The monastery and Big Buddha are free, but cable car and bus ride down were not. We went on an overcast, mildly rainy day, which worked well for us, but if it gets stormy I understand they close the cable car. Take umbrellas against rain or sun. You are outdoors most of the time."

Unlike most of the big cathedrals of Europe which, these days, solely cater towards getting as many tourists through the doors as possible, it was nice to experience a Buddhist monastery that still authentically practices. Despite being next to Ngong Ping's tourist traps and having a commercialised restaurant on the ground floor, the monastery here does attempt to limit the commercialisation of its sites.Signs calling for \"no photos/no visitors\" abound throughout the main building, and because of this most of the tourists seem to stick to the outside plaza rather than trying to gain access to the temple itself. If one does decide to try and get in, they do not seem to have too much of a problem with it as long as you are respectful and don't get in the way.People will be walking swiftly between the Buddha statues, bowing respectfully at each one, and moving on. Keep an eye out for them, and step out of the way if one is near, and they will be fine with you having a look around. Equally, the occasional photo seems permissible, as long as you aren't walking around, camera in hand, trying to document everything you see. Be mindful of your surroundings and respectful of the temple, and that way the trip becomes a lot more enjoyable for everyone."

This monastery is also noted for making wooden bracelets that are only sold near the Tian Tan Buddha statue. The Po Lin Monastery is one of Hong Kong\u2019s most important Buddhist sanctums and has been dubbed \u2018the Buddhist World in the South\u2019. Home to many a devout monk, this monastery is rich with colourful manifestations of Buddhist iconography and its pleasant garden is alive with birdsong and flowery scents. You can also enlighten your appetite at their popular vegetarian restaurant.For more please read my review of \"Lantau Island\""

It was a really hot day and we had to keep stopping for a breather, not for the faint hearted but well worth it when you get to the top. There are some lovely restaurants around the monastery area at the base along with the usual souvenir shops, and the 10,000 golden Buddhas are amazing."

There is also this nice monastery to see, with a few different rooms of statues, a peaceful outdoor area, and places to eat vegetarian lunch. You can take the cable cars up from the train station, but I recommend finding an alternative way up and using those cable cars to go back down, to avoid the lines of tourists waiting for the ride up. Be respectful when walking the grounds of the monastery and enjoy the tasty vegetarian dishes. I'm not a fan of most vegetables but there was still plenty for me to eat that I liked. You may come across some stray dogs and a cow here or there, which helps remind you of the more remote location you are in outside of the big city."

This meant 2.5 hours queueing for the cable car ticket office...then another 45 minutes for the actual cable car. It was well worth the wait though - fantastic views of mountains and sea from the cable car. Then we arrived and made our way through the shops (some interesting and some tat-ful), before encountering the monastery itself - fascinating and inviting, we bought and lit some incense! The Big Buddha is huge (surprise surprise...) at the top of a reasonably long stairway. Amazing views of mountains around, it was a great experience and thankfully the queue to take the cable car back down was virtually non-existent. I would thoroughly recommend visiting the Big Buddha and Po Lin Monastery, but maybe try a weekday if you can to avoid the long queues!"

Since I haven't been there in such a long time, everything looks so different. Could also be because I was a lot younger back then. It's a lot more touristy then it was before. Glad there is coffee on the way, but I don't remember there was a lot of food choices. Best to bring a sandwich or go back to the city to eat. With all the shops on the walk way to the big buddha, and the stalls on the side. there are some interesting things to look at, but again very tourisity and felt like I'm in the airport shopping. Do be prepare to walk alot. If you wanted a little nature walk, you can walk to the entrance of the pheonix peak and there was the rock pillars with prayers on it. It's a nice hike for the morning. I think the next time I am there, I might do the phoenix mountain Hike. On the NP360, the paths looks super groomed with steps and wooden planks. Very well maintained."

Another option is to get closer to 5 pm, when queue is significantly shorter, but this will leave you less than one hour to see the place and get back, since last cable car departs at 6pm. Overall - nice experience, but do not stand in line for 3 hours to get there. Better go up by bus and back by cable car - the queue on the way back is way shorter."

It's a long ride on the MTR from TsimShaTsui to the last stop at Lantau Island but the ride is worth it. We took the tram to the top and walked the stairs to the giant Buddha. The statue is amazing in size and beauty and the view is fantastic. You could never imagine that there is an area of peace and tranquility in crowded Hong Kong. We went in Summer and it was very hot. Fall or Winter would have been much better. The tram is equally amazing, but a bit scary, for me at least, however, the ride was fantastic. I hope to have time again to visit Po Lin and spend a little more time relaxing and hiking in the area."

Getting to the monastery is a little bit of a trek and the queues for the cable car up to the village from tung chung can be very long.That said, this attraction is genuinely worth the wait. The Buddha statue is mammoth and truly a sight to behold. It's particularly fun to spot it from a variety of angles before actually getting there. You can then test your fitness levels by taking the stairs up to the statue when you arrive!The monastery is very tasteful and there are usually a large number of devotees burning incense and making offerings. The smoke can be overwhelming so be sensible and don't hang around the area for too long. There is also a nice vegetarian cafe in the monastery grounds that serves really good dim sum and dessert.A must see in hk."

Whether you are religious or not, you cannot fail to admire this status to Buddha and the work that went in to make it happen.

As you explore the area you will find large incense sticks burning, people praying & ultimately the tour ends with the grand hall of ten thousand Buddhas which is magnificent. I would have given this 5 stars but many areas did not allow you to take photographs which I found disappointing and the cable car was not running at the time.

Now, the other year when I visited Beijing and visited a glut of temples and monasteries I was quite taken aback by the vast crowds of people, pushing and shoving each other in order to get a better view of whats inside. The act of queuing never caught on in mainland China, so you often found yourself doing as the locals do.I was expecting the same at Po Lin, and you can imagine my surprise at how peaceful and almost tranquil it was. There were people there, but not the huge throngs of humanity showing disrespect to one another.We were able to walk up to the main building, take a peek inside, take pictures where we were allowed, and then go about our business elsewhere. Though admittedly it might have been quite just because of the time we visited. I'd like to know how busy it gets at the height of the holiday season...The monastery consists of several buildings - the \"Main Shrine Hall of Buddha\", the \"Hall of Bodhisattva Skanda\", and, of course, the Tian Tan Buddha (though you could argue that this is a separate attraction). There is also the \"Grand Hall of Ten Thousand Buddhas\", the \"Library\" and the \"Dharma Hall\". Basically a haven for the Buddhist religion.It's a very nice place to visit and should be part of your visit to the Big Buddha."

You go there on the same excursion as seeing the Big Buddha. It is about 4 easy blocks from the base of Big Buddha. You get to the courtyard outside of the Monastery and there are swarms of people buying sticks or larger of incense and placing them in large offering pots near the entrance. The smells and visuals were super. Then you walk through the first courtyard and see the main Temple area which has three stunning Gold Buddhas amidst some lotus and orchids, then behind that is a giant room holding 5 larger buddhas and smaller buddhas all over the four walls, hard to explain but dont miss it, I did not see this during my prior visit. The Monastery has food, all veggie, you can buy a meal ticket there or down at the base of the Big Buddha. Surely an enduring highlight of my visit."

I took the bus as the Q for car cable is too long (about 1.30hrs wait) and bus fare at 17.20HKD for weekday and 27HKD for weekend and Public Holiday. Get exact amount as no change given. Good if you have a Octopus card (Train/Bus top up card). For 38HKD you can try the vegetarian snack meal at the monastery."

Indeed Buddha welcome questions and was Kind and compassionate alas this monetary etc is not!In the Temple monastery as with the Big Buddha (Not the largest) If one dares to Climb to the top of the Big Buddha and see an opening under the Buddha where a female 'security guard' is (with No Signage saying don't enter) Please don't enter you'll be Loudly and very Rudely Shouted at and Rudely Waved away with hostility! Certainly No Compassion there, No Transparency or Kindness where Photo taking or anything else is concerned in this Temple monastery! Even the Nuns will Meanly skulk around.

When we visited the Big Buddha, it was a very cloudy day, which made the cable car trip from Tung Chung MTR to Ngong Ping on the Ngong Ping 360 cable car even more special. Although a bit on the expensive side, the cable car ride was one of the best we had experienced. Taking in the sights of Lantau Island, passing the airport on the way, overlooking the bay... it was just incredible.At the top, at the Ngong Ping Village, the weather was much the same, with a constant cloud cover. The village was meticulously clean and the shops were really incredible. Just stepping in to the village itself brought sense of calm and relaxation on us. We started to feel at peace with ourselves and our environment. It was the start of a special journey through the village, leading up to the Big Buddha statue!Leaving the Ngong Ping Village, the path to the Big Buddha was flanked on both sides by the Twelve Divine Generals. These statues were absolutely incredible and they represent the Chinese Zodiac. I couldn't help notice that some of the names were similar to some of our Hindu gods, suggesting a lot of similarities in both religions.Looking up at the base of the Big Buddha's attraction, we could hardly see anything. The 260 steps leading up to the statue were obscured by the cloud cover. We started climbing steps, thinking it would be a tiring climb, especially for our 6 year old daughter, but we managed it with ease.The Big Buddha statue is awesome! We spent about an hour up there, just walking around and visiting the inside of the statue. It was an experience that cannot be easily described in words. You have to go there to feel what we felt."

Purchase the meal ticket near the bottom of the steps to the Buddha or right next to the restaurant and get free entry to musuem beneath the Big Buddha which houses a Buddha relic.

Sadly we went on the last day of our stay and didnt have much time to explore.The place is like a piece of heaven. Be prepared for long queues for the cable car. It is advisable to book the tickets online as the queue for online booking is much smaller. Give this an entire day if not more in your itinerary. The weather can disrupt the cable car service. So pray before you go :-)"

We spotted several monks in this area. Behind the Monastery you can find a Shrine of 10,000 Buddhas which is truly amazing.

In addition the bus drops off away from the tourist village of Nyong Ping so we avoided that. Overall I had a great day and would recommend a visit."

Constructed in the early 20th century, it is now one of the most popular monasteries to visit in Hong Kong, much to do with its proximity to the Big Buddha and Ngong Ping cable car. Opening Hours are 8am to 6pm every day. The feature attraction of the Po Lin Monastery is the recently opened (Oct 2014) Grand Hall of the Ten Thousand Buddhas. The Grand Hall and adjacent buildings display a colourful and decorative exterior that is lovely to view on clear days. The interior of the monastery is also worth having a look, make sure to see the three seated buddha figures. While you are on the monastery grounds, find the giant Reunification Cauldron which was made to commemorate the return to Hong Kong to the People's Republic of China. The large Mountain Gate Entrance to the monastery grounds is also interesting. Just a few minutes away you can visit the Big Buddha statue, while the Ngong Ping village is a few minutes further walk in the direction of the upper cable car terminus. Our preferred way to visit the Po Lin Monastery is to take the Ngong Ping 360 cable car from Tung Chung. This is an enjoyable and scenic approach to the area attractions. You can also take public bus 23 directly to the Ngong Ping Village, 5-6 minute walk to Po Lin Monastery. Tip: Other attractions on Lantau Island that you may wish to before or after Po Lin Monastery include the Citygate Outlet Shopping Mall back at Tung Chung, the nearby Tai-O fishing village (bus 21) or Mui Wo beach and village (bus 2). If visiting to/from Central, there is ferry service between Central an Mui Wo as well. For those with layovers in Hong Kong, you can take bus S1 between the airport and Tung Chung, just outside the Ngong Ping 360 lower terminus. The bus ride is 12-15 minutes one-way. Just be aware of the cable car opening hours (10-6pm weekdays, 9-6.30pm weekends) and potential queues at both the lower and upper terminuses. Note: Taxi service to/from the Po Lin Monastery is readily available at the airport but be prepared to wait for taxi service when coming back down the mountain as service is far more limited in that direction."

From there it was a short walk to the Po Lin Monastery.First impressions were of disappointment. As we walked through the crowds and under the entrance arch, the Buddha was hardly visible through the murk of pollution. Bought some drinks and ice creams from the numerous vendors and then started the climb up the long stairway of almost 300 steps to the Buddha. There were many tourists and worshippers but the main feeling was that this was a commercial attraction rather than a holy place.A quick descent was followed by a pleasant meal at the vegetarian restaurant and then a look around the various halls with their ornate design and religious artifacts and relics. Several visitors were happily ignoring the 'no photography' signs.There is no doubt that the the scenery is spectacular but there is a vast difference in atmosphere between this relatively recent Big Buddha (completed in 1993) and some of the really old temple sites in Sri Lanka or Myanmar. Perhaps the crush of visitors was the problem. Hard to avoid that in such a populous area.Overall, the initial disappointment was maintained throughout the visit. Others obviously disagree."

The food is plain and simple but healthy and nourishing - as it should be. This was my second visit in four and a half years and it felt both times like a mini pilgrimage: taking the boat from the centre of Hong Kong to Lantau then a coach to the the monastery before climbing the 264 steps to be next to the Tian Tan Buddha who dominates the landscape surrounded by Boddhisattvas. Inside the lotus upon which the Buddha sits, there is a well worthwhile exhibition. On the second floor (I think!) is simple painting of the Buddha 'going for it' : a depiction of utter fearlessness and openness to uncertainty and anything the future has to offer. It is breathtakingly inspiring every bit as much as the huge serenity of the parent which embodies it. After the climb and respectful visit treat yourself to the cablecar back down to the main island, preferably with a glass bottom. It takes just over half an hour I think, and you can see the planes landing, taking off, taxiing like toys at the start of your descent then as you get closer you can appreciate them for the sky dragons they really are."

I admit to complaining pretty much the entire way from Kowloon to Hong Kong Island to the ferry that took us to Lantau Island to being jammed on a bus along a 45 minute ride to get to the Giant Buddha and the Po Lin Monastery. Fortunately, we had a private guide that helped us navigate the several legs of public transportation.Once there however, Po Lin Monastery was inspired. Set atop a mountain on Lantau Island, the Giant Buddha stands over 100 feet tall. Of course the 250 steps to the top are daunting, particularly for a dad with seven knee surgeries on his right knee! But it was worth it. The Buddha is amazing - inspiring at over 100 feet tall. Once down the steps, don't miss visiting the two main buildings of the Po Lin Monastery. The closest temple is an amazing site - every detail covered. But the next building over cannot be missed. The Grand Hall of 10,000 Buddhas was jaw-dropping.Do not miss the Po Lin Monastery if you have the chance.Before you go, we finished the tour by taking the 25 minute tram ride down to the city next to the airport where we caught a 35 minute cab ride back to Kowloon. My point is that despite my complaints about the hassle getting to Po Lin, it could have been much easier if we had just taken the taxi and fantastic tram ride both ways. Do that!"

It also has big Buddha watching over it.The monastery is made of what I have always considered traditional Chinese building with engravings and dragons all over the building and its painted in bright colours. There are areas where you can burn essence sticks and there is lots of areas for worship which you would expect in a monetary, there is one hall which has 3 giant gold Buddha which are beautifully decorated even the ceiling is hand painted.Then there is the hall of warriors which has 6 gold statues of fallen warriors which again is amazing with all the detailed decoration but by far my favourite part of the monastery and the hall blew my mind right at the back so it isn't as easily found as the others is the hall of ten thousand Buddhas this hall is amazing and I could quite happily spend all day just looking at the detail in this hall their are 5 gaunt Buddhas being presented with gifts then there is a boarder of gold Buddhas going right around the hall then all around them are thousands of tiny Buddhas it's completely unbelievable you have to see it to believe it.So all in all loved the monastery but you can not miss the hall of ten thousand Buddhas !!"

Colorful and complex roof structure of the buildings is amazing. Outside you can see very large incense sticks lit and offered to Buddha. Saw many locals worshiping here.This must be visited if you come to see the Big Buddha. It is about 3 minutes walk to your right from the steps down from Big Buddha."

Journey to this monastery begins at the Tung Chung Cable Car station to Ngong Ping and then a short walk to the Monastery.This monastery is filled with tranquility. There is also a restaurant offering Chinese vegetarian meals for HKD98 or HKD138/person depending on which set you are choosing.There are about 3 halls in this monastery which are open to public to do prayers in front of statues of the Buddha. I find this place relaxing and calming, a good time away from the hustle and bustle of the city life."

While the monastery itself was fascinating, like most religious places in Hong Kong, we didn't get much to understand what people were doing and what everything meant. It was soon meal time and we sat down at the table. We were served vegetarian food, alright. But what that meant was boiled vegetables (extremely large pieces), a ton of soup and heaps of rice. For an experience, I'd urge everyone to try it. If you are looking for quality food, though, look elsewhere."

It's nice to get photos through the big gate entering the main yard of the monastery. Monastery buildings are nice and well kept with many chrysanthemum flowers. Overall a pleasant visit.

The taxi was 200 HKD (about $25 US) and the one way cable car was 165 HKD. I chose to arrive there before the 8:00am opening and had the place to myself to explore with out the crowds that come on the cable cars and buses.There are plenty of walks to talk from simple paths to hikes though the trees. The buddha statue is here as well but it opens at 10:00.This was the second Buddhist monastery that i have visited, the other was in Narita City, Japan. The ground around Po Lin did not measure up to the in Narita. Trash could be seen off the trails, sidewalk and paths were not well kept. The \"tea houses\" that I read about looked horrible."

What is even better is that my friend decided to treat us to the vegetarian lunch at the site restuarant. I will definitely recommend eating here. The atmosphere is just so serene and according to my friend you need to pay for your lunch using a coupon system as it is for a charitable cause. There was four of us and we were served a really delicious lunch. Best of all, the taste was really good with no msg detected. The servings was also very generous. The place is fairly small but very organised. It's air-conditioned too which provides us a welcome respite from the heat. Once we are done with our lunch,we adjourn to the Monastery. There was quite a bit of construction works that was ongoing, so we just wandered around where we are allowed too. It's a serene place to be at and the art-works are very educational too. If there is time, take a look at the various artefacts. What I find is that because the journey itself to the island can be very time-consuming, it means that at the end of the day, you will not have a lot of time to wander around at a leisurely pace. My advice is to make sure one plans way ahead to allow for time to see all the attractions here."

Still, that doesn't mean that it doesn't have anything to offer: it's similar to any Chinese Buddhist temple, but larger than most. The place is under constant upgrading, and as people donate large sums of money, becomes more ornate and interesting. If you go to the Big Buddha, definitely do not forget to go to the monastery and see it too."

I visited this place for a few times, and will keep come back, because inside the Big Buddha, there sit my parents memorial plates, which my sister arranged and reserved for my parents. But besides that, this is a wonderful place for all to visit. It is up in a mountain with many steps, requiring a strong and healthy body to climb up. But it is just a matter of time and patience, and it is definitely worthwhile to take the trip to go up. You can take a short break in the middle, while taking some pictures. In no time, you will be at the top, overlooking the views down, and the feeling is very peaceful and open. Again at the foot of the Buddha, there is a big open are where you can go around and take pictures of a few small guarding Buddhas in front. When you are ready, you can go inside the Buddha and join for the tour and learn about the history of the Buddha and for some people to do worshipping. You don't have to be religious to feel the peacefulness of this place. Just feel good to experience the culture of local people is an amazing experience!"

I've been to a number of temples around Asia but this remains one of my favourites - not least because it has by far the best food on offer.

It was a weekday and there were no crowds and now waiting. It was a perfect experience touching all of the senses. We took the fabulously clean public transportation, then the tram ride, which for some reason I didn't expect. During the ride over we passed over thick forests with just quick peeks at the trail that some brave people were trekking up the mountain. We also watched what appeared to be whole families that appeared to be digging something out of the sand in the shallows. Then came the climb to the monastery and the Buddha. Everything was mesmerizing, the elaborate stone carvings, the lush flowers, the sudden and quickly over downpour that engulfed us. We bought a gorgeous umbrella and serious rain parka and started our climb up to the Buddha. What a magnificent bronze! And surrounded by the bronzes of the maids offerings. As with most things in china you are struck first by the beauty then the wonder of how did they do that! They are a resourceful and industrious people. The view from the top was also worth the climb. Then we had lunch at the monastery. How simple, delicious and I cannot describe the feeling of peacefulness that came over us. I think I could have stayed there for the rest of the day, at least. Do yourself a big favor and do not miss this!"

How many times have you landed on Hong Kong's Chep Lap Kok international airport and have no idea as to how massive this land-filled airport looks like from one vantage point ? The entire airport operation unveils in front of you as you go higher and higher on the Ngong Ping 360 cable car ride. Try and book the \"crystal car\" with glass bottom floors to get that feel of being suspended in air. Enoy looking down from your glass bottom floors of the cable car onto greeneries along the mountain side, a nice walking trail (for those who want to attempt this, it takes about 5 hours one way), look down onto pristine waters and scattered fishing villages along the shores of the island. During low tide, many of the villagers are seen on the shores catching cockle shells to sell in the fish market. There are 2-3 things you can do once you get off from the cable car station. Climbing up 200+ steps to meet the Bid Buddha. It is worth making that big effort of climbing up to enjoy a 360 degree view of the mountains in the area. Visiting the famous Po Lin Monastery which has been discovered by the Buddhist monks a few hundred year ago in Lantau Island used a a centre for meditation. Look for the Vegetarian restaurant and make reservations to enjoy a vegetarian meal next to the Po Lin Temple. Before leaving this peaceful retreat, stop by some of the shops to familiarize yourself with Buddhist relics, Buddhist chants and enjoy a leisurely cup of tea or coffee with a gasp of fresh air in between that one cannot get when back in the hustle bustle life of Hong Kong's downtown shopping district.It is also a good break for the kids to see something different in Hong Kong aside from shopping malls.It is definitely a nice respite when you are broke and exhausted from shopping !As a reminder. check first if the fog is going to block of view of the Big Buddha. If it is foggy up in the mountains, do not go."

The village that they have built at the top is just a big tourist rip off. I last visited Po Lin in the late eighties when I lived in Hong Kong and before the big budda was there. Alot has changed and although the monastery is worth the trip I just hated what they have done to the place tourist wise. It was a big disappointment.

About 7k walk, took me two hours including plenty of stops for photographing the hidden away monasterys on the way down the montainside in the valley. Much more worth seeing than the Po Lin manastery, much more real. The walkway was nicely prepared and not hard to walk down, where it was steep there was always built in stairsteps. Went through rainforest, mountainside and valley, with beautiful views, smells and a sense of total calm. Hearing the monks singing when walking through the rainforest was absolutely amazing! In total I met three budist monks and one brave person walking UP the montain, in my whole two hours of walking.

First off- when you go up to the person to get your number, make sure they really see you because you likely won't understand them when they call for you. Keep an eye on the people who arrived before you so you can figure out when you're getting close. Its ok to hover- I stood close enough to read the page of names/numbers so I knew for sure when it was my turn. Keep your number out so the hostess can see it too.

Just avoid weekends and public holidays as the wait is very long just to get on the cable cars. Amazing views on the cable car and at the top. While we focused on visiting the Buddha and temple, there are other activities like eating with the monks.The monastery itself was interesting and the giant Bhudda, well it was impressive I must say.

We stood in line for an hour to take the cable car attraction to the mountain and we had to wait an hour to return. The wait was worth it, as Hong Kong People are charming and patient. When we arrived and walked off the cable car attraction, it reminded me of the same tourist trap kitsch like that of Gatlinburg, Tennessee. I really don't understand why us humans ruin some of the most beautiful and high quality natural places with shopping villages that have a mocked Bavarian style theme. It is so awful. Anyway, we all sat down to a late lunch together. We ate at the restaurant where food is served on the second floor. The food was awful and my wife was so disappointed that she was threatening never to eat another Chinese style meal again. That is not a good when we still had three more days to stay in China. Her intuitional radar was right on though, as two of our party of seven were sick with food poisoning the very next day. This was not an auspicious start for the day.As we wandered through the village towards the shrine, there was a subtle yet discernible change. The shops steadily improved in quality. Be sure to check out the chopsticks shop, it is very nice and high quality. We are very pleased with the gifts we bought there. Then it changed again, as we walked onto the plaza towards the big white arches we encountered many medium sized dogs. They were unlike any others we have seen in HK. These dogs radiated a unique sense of place and and ignored all of the human going-ons around them. There were dogs asleep on benches, there was a dog curled up in the middle of the plaza, who didn't move for anyone. Small children were having their pictures taken with these animals. To me, it was very unusual to see these animals acting so out of character. The trek to the Buddha came next, all two hundred steps. We climbed took pictures and I went into the museum inside. There are beautiful portraits they recount the history of Buddha and then there is the artifact on display. As a Christian from the United States it profoundly affected me, at both an intellectual and spiritual level. I am still trying to process. It gave me a much deeper appreciation of this place and its people and most of all it's history. The temple is beautiful and deeply spiritual too. The incense burning, the birds, the mountains, it is all so magical. Our party were deeply moved by this excursion. This is an experience of a lifetime."

At the time we visited, the Monastery was under renovation so you couldn't appreciate the beauty of the building. But we did happen across prayer time when the monks were praying and chanting. The monastery gardens were beautiful and if you have time, I recommend doing the short wisdom walk which is around the back of the monastery. You get a taste of the beauty of the Hong Kong highlands. As it was such a windy day, the cable car was very bumpy and for those with a weak stomach, you may feel a little queezy."

I recommend you go there early in the morning because the line to the Ugong Ping 360 cable car is always super busy. They open at 10 am. We got there at 12:30pm there was a super long line all the way from the cable car station to the subway... It took us 2 hour and 40 mins to get on the cable car eventually. And it only took 25 minutes to get to Po Lin MonasteryI don't think there is a need to take that crystal cable car because the view on the way is just ok and its not like very high. There are a lot of local style stores under the Buddha including restaurants and merchandise. The view from under the giant Buddha is great. It's kinda weird that I didn't see any monk around.We took the shuttle bus back to Tung Chong subway station. They have the bus service every 20 minutes and it takes you about 40 mins each way. The bus ticket cheap comparing to the cable car, only 17 HKD. You can use octopus card as well.I highly recommend you go there in the morning to avoid the long line and spend half day there enjoying the local culture."

I get car sick sometimes on windy roads, and I was definitely feeling a bit queasy when we arrived. There is an air-tram that goes there and if I ever go back, I'll take that instead. The Buddha was built in 1997, so you aren't seeing anything ancient. But the park is nicely laid out and if you can get yourself up all the steps to the Buddha, there is a magnificent view at the top. The Buddha will also reward you for climbing all those steps as you get a ticket (before you go up) for bottled water and an ice cream after you've gone inside the little museum.The Po Lin Monastery is there. It's not as fabulous as the Buddist temples I saw in Japan, but it's interesting. There are many new buildings going up, so over time, there will be more to see.The ride up by bus, (despite my feeling queasy) was great. It takes you through isolated neighborhoods surrounded by trees and you get occasional terrific views of the water."

The feel of the place though seems more commercial at first due to large crowds but soon the energy of the place envelopes you with all its beautiful shrines and temples. Being next to the big Buddha is an advantage as it increases its grandeur. The vegetarian food is very delicious and fresh and not expensive. The touristy shops outside provide the best Buddhist trinkets."

The tix are excellent value as, not only are you treated to a spectacular 25 min cable car ride across Tung Chung Bay and Lantau Island parkland, you have free access to Ngong Ping Village (touristy but charming), the huge and impressive bronze Buddha statue and the very colourful Po Lin Monastery. It is a full daytrip if you have the time, and as the Po Lin Monastery is right next door to the Big Buddha, you must take a look. The outdoor area by the monastery has lots of pretty shade trees and seating, lovely if you don't mind the scent of incense burning. And there is LOTS of incense being burned as offerings to Buddha! (Probably best to avoid if you have breathing issues!) The main temple buildings are very colourful and make for fabulous photos. There is a vegetarian restaurant where you can dine in, however my friend and I bought veg food from a takeaway place next to the restaurant. I truly can't recommend it - I bought a dish of 3 type of tofu (spicy, sweet & sour, another I can't remember) and it was AWFUL! I love vegetarian meals and tofu, but this was horrible, both tastewise and visually. If I visited Ngong Ping again, I would have lunch at the Ngong Ping Village."

Visiting this place is more more easy now by comparasion to before. The MTR can take you to Tung Chung where one can choose to take the cable car or the bus to go up to the monastery. Once you arrived, you can climb up the stairs to the Big Bhddha, There is no charge to see the Bhddha, but if you want to see one of the exhibition on the first floor, you have to buy a ticket for HK$28, that include the entrance fee and a vegetarian dim sum treat afterwards. Or if you choose to try their vegetarian meal for $78. It opens from 11 am to 3 pm for food in the Restaurant there. Once you climb up to the Buddha, you have a good view of the Lantau Island. There are many exotic statues if you are into photography. On the ground there, there are a few temple one can visit, but there are also a lots of construction going on at the moment. I found the colourful surrounding make it a real good opportunities to take photos especially if you do not live in Asia, this make very good holiday photos."

I always pictured Hong Kong as a giant concrete jungle with barely any wilderness - going to Po Lin Monastery changed my perception. We took the gondola ride up to monastery which i highly recommend doing. It offers a spectacular view of the area below; in short time you'll go from looking at skyscrapers to looking at mountains, forests and beaches. As you get closer the Tian Tan Buddha will appear in the distance, also known as \"Big Buddha\" it is a giant statue at the top of the hill and is the main attraction in the area.Once we arrived we made our way to the statue. You really can't appreciate it's size until you're standing below it looking up! You can spend quite a bit of time climbing the stairs and checking out the smaller statues that surround it. After, we walked over to the monastery to pay our respects and admire the beautiful artwork found inside. Later on we found a little spot where the nuns were serving soup so we sat down for a nice vegetarian lunch, i'm not sure what all the ingredients were (there was no menu) but it was good.I suggest preparing for a half-day excursion. Between the gondola ride, spending time at the statue/monastery and eating lunch you'll need a good 4 hours. It's worth it!"

The bus ride is quite scenic so have your camera ready and take a window seat on the bus. When we entered the main gate of the monastery you become so consumed with the size of the Buddha. One has to be in pretty good shape to walk up the 280 plus steps to be close to the Buddha. There is no charge to do this. If you decide to purchase a ticket to go inside the museum and go a little bit higher you will receive a coupon that you can redeem for a cold water and an ice cream treat after you have gone through the Buddha.The sights from this height are awesome. Hope for a day that has some wind so it can blow some of the air pollution out. We were fortunate that this was the case for us. As we arrived relatively early, I think we were ahead of the major air pollution that had not arrived as of 1 p.m.The grounds below are beautiful.

I absolutely loved the metropolitan bustle of Hong Kong during our stay there, but this day was a memorable escape into some peacefully beautiful countryside."

Included was early hotel pick up and drop off via bus to ferry. Lantau is very peaceful compared to the buzz of Hong Kong, so great if you'd like to get away from the crowds. Our bus tour guide was excellent, he had been doing the tour for many years and he shared a wealth of knowledge about Hong Kong, Lantau the fishing village and the monks and monastery. A vegetarian lunch was included in our day tour prepared at the monastery. Food was beautiful, very fresh. We returned from the big Buddha via the Ngong Ping 360 chairlift - amazing views from the monastery to the bus pick up on this 5.7klm ride. We were lucky on the trip down via the chairlift to have Ngong Ping 360 employee leaving work to ride with us - she shared so much information with us about the construction of the chairlift and other top attractions to catch while on our visit to Hong Kong. A really worthwhile trip. I highly recommend to include tour in your HK adventure."

Well this weekend I had that chance and regret not going sooner. The wait to get tickets is rather long. I wish I had gone online beforehand and book my ticket. That wold have made my wait much less painful.Once at the Po Lin village grab some refreshments and stay hydrated.A very nice day trip and recommend if you haven't done it before."

You need to be able to walk about 200 steep steps to get to the head of the buddha. To get to the monastery, you can go by bus or now they have a tram which would definitely be the way to go. Not much to do up there but take pictures, eat local fare and ice cream. But definitely work seeing."

This was indeed very impressive and we were fortunate that the skies were relatively clear as it can be very hazy there. After our visit to the Buddha we had a reasonable vegetarian lunch in Po Lin Monastery and then made our way through a Disney-like village (a mini-theme park where the theme was Buddha!) to take the cable car ride down from Ngong Ping to Tung Chung. The ride was fun, with great views, and again we were fairly lucky with the weather. Our tour was for the day, we were taken over by ferry and had an excellent tour guide. I'm sure you could do this trip individually without too many problems but being part of a tour - we were a small group - was very fast and efficient, making the most of our time, and we had an excellent guide. We'd recommend a visit to this huge and impressive Buddha and the cable car ride is stunning and not to be missed."

Only for me, I made a small mistake but made sure I made it to see Po Lin. I realized during the ferry ride my flight time out of Hong Kong was earlier then I thought and we came to the harbor to get onto the bus, I didn't go as I debated to get back on the ferry and head back to make it to the airport. I sat at the harbor debating what I should do since the bus to Po Lin was already well on it's way there. I thought to myself, \"you are so close, why would you go back.....\" When I finally decided not to be a party pooper, I hailed the next cab, got in the back, pulled out my map, pointed to Po Lin, explained I had very little time to go there (sigh language, smiles, airplane sign, time, and clock helped) to get my point across. My cabby took me all the way around the island to Po Lin, the giant Buddha. Hong Kong has beautiful beaches if you're in the right area, very quaint towns on your way to the attraction. You can the Buddha from the road in certain areas, and as soon as we pulled up, I asked the cabby to wait 5 mins so I can run, take photos, run back and go to the airport, he obliged. I ran up the stairs and took as many photos as I could all the way around Po Lin, lots of tourists but a great site to see none the less. After 5 mins, I ran back down the stairs, cabby was still waiting for me, hopped in and off to the airport we go only to find out, it's on the island as the Buddha and all we had to do was drive over the mountain so what a stellar decision to see it as it was well worth the spontaneous adventure. Massive Buddha.... Namaste.. Traveled Jan 09'"

It's the last stop on the MTR train after Disney Hong Kong. It's a 30 minute ride, but you won't be disappointed. Quick tip, if you use a Visa \"Signature\" card, you get a discount and extra pass into one of the exhibits. Save your money on the \"glass bottom\" gondola as you can pretty much see everything from the windows of the gondola.While we focused on visiting the Buddha and temple, there are other activities like eating with the monks. I'm told that you can have lunch in a shared table or by yourself. if you sit at a shared table you'll have the entire table eating all the food and picking through with their chopsticks. Personally, I don't want anyone elses chopsticks touching my food. We ate later in the day, however your entry fee to the bottom of the Buddha gives you a coupon good for a bottle of water and ice cream bar (which is much needed in the 90 degree heat).Buddha is absolutely incredible. While the walk up the steps is tough for those with asthma, its worth the effort. Lot's of gift shots and souvenir photo's of you getting on the gondola and off. They have the photo's, keychain, snow bubble already for you once you step off the gondola in either direction.Enjoy!"

            "review": "A nice alternative to HK Disneyland. If you have extra time in Hong Kong and want to see a little bit of the outskirts (and not HK Disneyland), you can check out the Po Lin Monastery where the world's largest outdoor sitting buddha statue is located. The monastery is located in Lantau Island (same place where HK Disneyland is), and can be conveniently reached by train, bus, and cable car. Take the MTR from Central all the way to Tung Chung station, then take the no. 23 bus from the station to the monastery or the cable car. The bus is a comfortable tourist bus and costs about HK$17 per person. Note that the buses are behind the shopping center in front of the Tung Chung railway station. The trip to the monastery took about 45 minutes, but the roads are good and scenic. Those who are in a hurry opt to take the cable car, but the line is usually long. Entrance ticket to the Big Buddha is about HK$30, which entitles you to have a look-see at the first floor of the museum inside the buddha statue as well as a free ice cream. You can pay extra to see the second floor and to get a vegetarian meal at the top of the buddha statue. The view from the Big Buddha platform are amazing. The monastery is a short distance from the stairs to the Big Buddha, and is marked by this huge gate.You can then take the cable car back to Tung Chung station. The cable car station is inside the Ngong Ping village just outside the monastery grounds, where you could buy some souvenirs. There is also a \"wishing tree\" where people leave their wishes with the hope of them being granted. The cable car ride to the Tung Chung station costs about HK$60 for a normal cabin (more expensive for the glass-bottomed cabin for the more adventurous types), and the view is spectacular! The cable car trip will only take about 15 minutes. You can then take the MTR back to Hong Kong island or wherever you are staying."

On a clear day, views from cable car are first class. Po Lin Monastery is quaint but a lot of shops around are very touristy. Meal in monastery refectory is very cheap, wholesome but will be far more than you can eat and is served a la soup kitchen style! Never-the-less the whole package - cable car, big buddha, monastery - does make an interesting day out."

Took the cable car last year and enjoyed the ride with great views but should have stayed on and not got off at the top.A rather tacky tourist complex greets you and after spending a few minutes walking through it with not one place enticing us in we headed for the Budha. With a hot sticky climb up and a ice cream at the top we had had enough, we decided to skip the Monastery and we headed back to the cable car. Unless your a budhist or into temples I would skip this attraction especially if you are on a tight schedule as there are to many other intersting things in Hong Kong to see."

The temple is quite breathtaking some wonderful photos can be taken from the temple looking up to the Budha. Walk up the stair to the Budha - do not be tempted to take the shuttle bus as you are supposed to gain enlightenment , I got very hot and thirsty!! The Budha is amazing and the museum inside air conditioned. You also get a bottle of water and a free ice-cream as part of the admission cost! It was a great day out, very hot but wonderful. A must if you are visiting Hong Kong"

Be sure to take thebus if you want to arrive there before it's overrun with tourists. Also, a lady who seemed to be working for the cable car operator tried to confuse us telling us we should wait in line for the cable car to start operating rather than taking the bus. The bus is half the price for a return trip and by taking the bus we arrived at the monestary when it opened."

It's official title is the 'Largest Bronze Sitting Buddha in the World'! It just blows you away when you first see it.We took the ferry from Hong Kong Island to Lantau and then the bus up to the monastery. Be prepared for climbing what seems like millions of steps! You actually go inside the buddha and it's actually very poignant and spiritual whatever your religion.There is a gift shop at the bottom and you also get a vegetarian lunch from the monastery itself which was delicious.The monks go about their business in complete harmony with all the tourists hovering around and they are happy to chat and answer questions.A word of advice - take a 'fast ferry' to the Island - it only takes about 45 mins, but the regular ferries seemed to take hours! They alternate the services, so it's worth waiting for the fast ones each time.All in all a brilliant day!"

We took the ferry out from HK island, and had a very enjoyable walk back down through the woods to Tung Chung to get the MTR back into Kowloon. An easy route to follow with great views, it takes a couple of hours. The monastery itself was interesting and the big bhudda, well it was impressive I must say. We really enjoyed it but I wouldn't say it was unmissable, unlike a trip on the Peak Tram."
