We had a brief but comprehensive safety talk about the use of the bikes. We were designated our own separate guide when they saw that our kids were young (9&7). Our guide,Zakaria, was super friendly and very careful and took us to the easier routes which were very manageable for the children. They had a wonderful time!!The driver then returned us back to the hotel. Thanks very much for a wonderful experience."

Taken approximately 30 minutes from Marrakech where we were greeted by our guide for the morning along with another couple. The safety talk was sufficient and not OTT like you'd expect, 2 minutes if that. The route was challenging but not overly difficult, he stayed at a decent pace but my adrenaline junkie partner wanted to go a bit faster. The Jews were spectacular with view of the Atlas Mountains and finishing off with tea and crepes around one of the surrounding lakes. Brilliant morning and good value for money. "

We had a group of 9, and although one of the drivers was late collecting us, it had no impact on the amount of fun we had.It's about a 30min drive from Marrakech, but it is rather scenic, before you arrive, get your helmet on and go.We saw a few other groups out on the desert, but they didn't look like they were having as much fun as us. Don't bother sharing one, you will ruin your adventure.We had mixed ability group, so were split, but still met up at check points and all finished at the same time."

We rode in total for 2-3 hours. The Quads were good, had no issues with not being fast enough! The Guide (Yusuf) was great, as was our driver (Yusuf)... All in all would strongly recommend to anyone who doesn't mind parting with a fair bit of cash! We have given this 5 out of 5 because we wouldn't experience something like this with better scenery ANYWHERE NEARBY!Regards J and G"

My boyfriend and I wanted to make something more adventurous and fun and fortunately a local recommended us Marrakech Quad Evasion, it was super awesome! The guides were kind with us and very patient since we didn't speak the local language, they managed to explain all the safety and security tips very well and always answered to all of our questions. I felt like I was in a adventure movie or something like that. The views were definitely the best part, I will always have this little trip on my memories thanks to that. If you're looking to do something different, I recommend you to visit this attraction, me and my boyfriend, as a couple, felt really glad that we did this.Some tips: -Bring your camera, you don't want to miss the views and take pictures riding a quad bike!-Don't forget the sun screener and water.-It is hot so you might use light clothes, but trust me, you will spent such a great time that you will totally forget about the weather."

By grace of their flawless customer-friendly experience, the tough terrain of dry and arid arid deserts appears to be a cakewalk. The thrills and spills of life in Marrakech can be never experienced up to the hilt without Marrakech Quad Evasion. They are so cordial and hospitable that one can feel easily at home with them even when they have arrived from distant locations. Two of my friends, who were once nothing short of dummies in bike riding in their earlier days, have now fallen in blind love with this activity so much, and all credit goes to the proficiency and might of their exceptionally talented guides. Moreover, their seamless fluency in English and French is another pivotal factor why I would recommend this firm to people all over the world."

Taking a short break in Marrakech, we were a party of six decided on a quad bike afternoon.So many companies to choose from but these guys were able to help out at short notice. Hotel pick up was a little late but no worries there, then a journey of approx 1/2 hour out to a village and into a small garage / workshop. The quads were waiting, quick demo, after gloves and helmet fitting and we were off. Through the town and into the rocky desert, amazing open space, but the weather was changing, on the the horizon a storm was approaching these guys were prepared with waterproofs for us all to wear, not the weather we were expecting in Morroco. It added a different feel to the afternoon and a memory I shall never forget, incredible trip with really nice staff, very focused on safety and vigilant of our welfare and enjoyment of the afternoon. Give these guys a go."

Driving while enjoying the amazing landscape of the village and the lake was amazing. We had a very friendly and helpful guide who brought with him cold water ( much needed in the middle of august!!). To finish the day, we stopped by a nice place for some Moroccan tea and crepe. Totally worth the price, i would go again for sure!!!"

We shared 3 quads and two of us rode singly. We arranged the excursion from UK by email - responses were quick and courteous. On the day of our trip we were met by one of the team who arrived at the hotel on time. Again he was patient and courteous. Our transport was in a clean minivan and he drove safely to our destination, which took about an hour. After a brief safety check and supervised riding near the lake we went on our journey with one of the guys at the front and another catching up from time to time. The quads themselves are quality machines and safety was always paramount. The guys took us across some breathtaking scenery including the mountains and lakes. The whole experience was around 3 hours. At the end they took us to a local house for some sweet tea and bread overlooking the lake which again was a brilliant end to the day. Our whole group was buzzing and said if they were to ever return to Marrakesh they would want to do the whole day. I try to quad whenever I go abroad and I have to say these guys were excellent. Top marks"

Definitely wear covered shoes and trousers as the heat from the sun and possibly the engine can really get to your legs if your are going in the warm season. Otherwise a loose breezy top will be fine and cooling as the wind blows against you.The mint tea and crepes with honey were a refreshing and well thought out break snack. Definitely recommend.

Have been lucky to go quad biking in Marrakech twice before with another company but fancied a different experience this time so booked the half day quad bkiing near the mountains, lakes and Agafay desert. Booked direct via email. Had a quick response and all booked in. Was told driver would collect from hotel at 9am and we could pay on the day in euros, English pounds or dirhams.On the day the driver was there a few minutes before pick up and drove us for about 40 minutes to the start point. Once there a quick demo, all equipment supplied, forms signed, money handed over and we were on our way. Off up the road to a little area to get used to the bikes then off on our ride we went. Our guide spoke little English but enough to get by. I explained that quite often I tend to veer off and he had me up the front behind him and whenever he felt I needed it he gestured which way to lean etc. No more veering off for me!! (Ended up in a vegetable patch on previous occasions!)The scenery was amazing, much better then our previous trip. We had a stop twice for water (freezing cold and supplied) and at the end you go to a lovely little place for tea and pancakes (even though it was Ramadan we were well catered for). I can honestly say that the views on this particular trip are amazing and the stop near the end overlooking the lake really took my breath away. Once it was over we were driven back to our hotel. There was no photos taken by the company but our guide offered to take loads for us.Tip: wear long trousers as the engines get hot and take plenty of sunscreen !! I really cannot recommend these people highly enough. There were 6 of us ages ranging from 16-61 and every single one of us said it was the highlight of our holiday. Thanks Quad Evasion!!"

We were the only 2 on the trip which added to the personal experience. Very good value also, we paid approx. 700mad each for the half day trip up to Lake Agfay, including gloves, helmet and glasses, plus tea and crepes at a local village (very tasty aswell!), a lot cheaper than many others when we looked. This is a perfect way to spend a few hours seeing the real Marrakech while getting the adrenaline going."

We had to change our reservation due to the weather and they were super friendly and flexible. They picket up at the hotel with a van only for the two of us and drove us all they way. The road to get there is already very enjoyable. Landscape is awesome with snowed high mountains at the back and desert dunes / rocky parts. Quads are a lot of fun and adventure, though we felt safe at all times. Tea and crepe by the lake was also great and conversation with the driver was very interesting and pleasant. Me and Jack totally recommend this tour, it was definetely a highlight of our Marrakech trip. The only \"but\" may be the price, which is high but maybe some bargaining is possible (we took the web price as is). Thanks a lot for the experience!"

It was good fun riding the quads, and we had great views over the dessert and the lake to the atlas Mountains. We certainly recommend the trip and the Company."

We we taken out just the two of us by Mafood (apologies on the spelling if incorrect) who was a really good bloke who showed us Berber villages in the Atlas mountains and took us on tracks through the Agafay desert. It was great fun and we felt very safe the whole time."

Neither of us had ever been on a quad bike before but what a location to take your first trip - Lake Takerkoust and the Agafay Desert with the backdrop of the Atlas mountains. WOW. We booked the day trip a couple of months prior to arriving in Marrakech but bang on 9am, Youssef was waiting outside our hotel as arranged and drove us out to a little town where we were kitted out. In a matter of minutes, we had been given our safety demo and were ready to go! The morning flew by and we were having lunch before we knew it. The restaurant we dined at (le Relais du Lac) was beautiful and in an idyllic setting. The food was incredible although we have absolutely no idea what we ordered as the waiter couldn't speak any English. It was a surprise when it came but like I said, it was really great. The afternoon passed as quickly as the morning as we weaved through villages and into what felt like the middle of nowhere. The desert really is stunning and so peaceful. We ended our day at a small cafe for crepes and mint tea which was shared with chickens and a cat. Lovely. Overall, an enjoyable break from the busy Medina and brilliant value for what is a full day out including meals. I would definitely recommend to anyone visiting Marrakech. Oh, and we also received photos of our day by email when we arrived back to the UK - a nice touch.If I did have a small criticism though, it would be that our guide Ahmed's English wasn't great so he didn't understand a lot of our questions but his English is a lot better than my Arabic so I can't really complain."

After a couple of emails to Youssef who provided lots of information we booked directly with him the night before the trip, we were picked up from our hotel the following morning and taken to a small village just outside the dessert, the set up was very professional and we were provided with dust masks helmets high vis jackets and gloves.. we then spent a couple of hours on the dessert with our guide who was excellent and we finished off at the lake having pancakes and drinks.. the guide also took photos of us and emailed them over.In my opinion this trip through quad evasion is far better than the trip booked through the reps and also a far better set up, great value for the money \u00a350 which included the 40 minute each way transfer and the snacks at the lake."

We found it difficult to source an excursion company in the centre so looked on trip advisor. We picked Marrakech quad evasion because of its reviews and it did not disappoint. I simply emailed Youssef from the hotel and asked if he had any availability, luckily he was able to squeeze the two of us onto a half day excursion near the Atlas Mountains. The price was extremely reasonable (our hotel offered quad biking but we later discovered that it was only around the Palmeraie and they wanted more for it!) The excursion was fantastic from start to finish and every little detail was thought of. Having never been on a quad before I was very nervous but Youssef was fantastic and made sure I knew what I was doing! I absolutely loved it and so did my partner. Would 100% go back to visit Youssef and his team and thoroughly recommend if anyone fancies quads to do the same. Best value for money!"

We used them last year and did camel trekking but this year wanted something a bit more adventurous. Excellent pickup service provided by Yousef in his 4x4...very personal service and friendly. The place is near the main Marrakech sport stadium so was around 45 mins from out hotel but the pickup vehicle was very comfortable for 4 people. The location is good, there are toilet facilities onsite but no payment by credit card so we paid cash on the day. The driver is willing to stop by an ATM should you need to get money out. Our quad bike guide was Zacharias and although his english wasn't perfect we had no problem communicating with him during the afternoon bike ride we had. They are safety conscious and will give you a full briefing about the bike as well as doing some test driving near the site before you go 'off road'.we have a brilliant 2.5 hours of quad biking and had 2-3 stops along the way. About half way there are refreshments at a berber village with tea and bread/olive oil. Our day is was very sunny and quite dusty so you do get dirty so dress appropriately. At the end of the day we were given a blow clean by a an air pressure hose, which got rid of most of the dust in our clothes.We all had great fun and found the staff friendly and helpful. A great half-day experience."

After reading reviews on here and emailing the company I opted for the shortest trip as It was my first time on a quad bike. I wore jeans as other people said your leg gets hot and mine did so I was grateful for my jeans, I wore a t shirt too and they provide a helmet. We just got dusty but if it rains you may get muddy too, so take old clothes. We were picked up from our hotel on time and driven about 15 minutes. Brief safety talk and then we all got on our quads and had a little practice. I was the only girl in my group and I wasn't the best. They asked me would I like to join a smaller group or go on the back of my husband and as I didn't want to spoil it for my husband by screaming slow down in his ear I opted for the slower group. I was so glad I did as there were girls and a family with them. I went slow at first and was quite scared but the guides are very patient and if you are Uncomfortable they will help you move your quad. By the end of the trip I had my foot down and enjoyed and felt pleased that I went on my own. Personally I wouldn't say it was easy as it was way outside my comfort zone but explain to the guides and they understand and will accommodate you. We stopped in a lovely ladies house for pancakes and mint tea which was lovely. Take wet wipes just to wipe your hands and face of dust, I always carry these and toilet paper in Morocco. My husband said it was the best quad trip he has been on, for a first timer myself I think I was very good. Paid for this in person once taken to the quad bike site in cash."

We stopped off a couple of times to take pictures which was good and finished by having a drink and some crepes in a local caf\u00e9 overlooking a lake which was lovely.As others have said, you get covered in dust so don't wear anything decent. However, they do blast you with air at the end to try and get rid of most of the dust which was a nice idea and a little surprising! I wore shorts which in hindsight wasn't the best idea as my legs started to burn next to part of the engine block which got quite hot so I do recommend wearing trousers.All in all a lovely morning (probably had around 2hrs on the bike) and definitely recommend it."

We had a prompt start, getting picked up at 9am ready to go to the Lake. Our driver, Marfoud was very punctual and on time. The lake took 40 minutes to get to, but worth every minute of it. The landscapes and scenes were lovely to see as it was a lot different to where we had been before as we had only been in the centre of Marrakech until then. When we arrived at the base, our quads were all ready to go. We put safety helmets on and had demonstrations on how to work the quad bikes properly. I had never ridden a quad bike before so i was a little apprehensive as to how i was going to get on. After we got going, it was very easy to pick up how to control the bikes. Our guide was very nice and gave us hand signals all of the way on whether we needed to slow down or not. We stopped along the way to take pictures and thankfully i now have some beautiful shots of some of the places we stopped. To end the exciting morning, we stopped at a lovely authentic restaurant looking straight onto the lake where we had traditional mint tea and crepes. It really was the best day of our holiday and my friends are all in agreement with me that we are glad we went with the company we did."

Dont worry if you feel like you might not be skilled enough on a quad to do this trip, we had a very young girl in our group who was orginally a passenger with her mum but the guide let her drive his quad with him on the back and at one point i checked the speedo and it read 50mph across sand. We stopped at the best locations to take photos. We stopped at a berber village briefly for tea and bread which was really nice. I would highly recommend this quad experience above any others out there. Take my word you will %100 love it and value for money is insane. My advice would be to wear old clothes because you get very dusty and take a rucksack to carry water in."

Unbelievable views the whole way round...plenty of speed and hair raising moments as well. The guide was great. On time pick up, few hours on the quads, great lunch (again with great views over the lakes) and transfer back to riad in Marrakech! Best thing we did by a complete mile considering excitement and value for money!"

Our day started off by getting picked up from our hotel at 9am sharp. It was about an hour drive to get to the quad bikes, but the time went fast with our cheerful driver/instructor.We were given a quick brief on how to use a quad bike with opportunity to ask any questions. Although it may seemed rushed they are more than happy to answer any questions. If you don't speak French or Arabic then you might have some communication issues.One the trip began it was clear the instructors are very good at what they do. He noticed my sister was not very confident and so have her extra attention and took us on an easier route until she was comfortable.At the end we were treated to some Moroccan pastry and some tea.We went through some amazing scenery and has a fantastic time, can't recommend these guys enough. Thanks for the amazing time!"

Until we did it again 4 days later in the palmgrove which was even better. Guide for our first day was Mafoud who collected us on time from our hotel and stayed with us through. Our family of 3 went off into the desert at high speed and had a great 2 hours of fun. If your confident speed just gets more and more but always safe. We climbed steep slopes and raced along riverbeds. At the end we have tea and pancakes before Mafoud returned us to our hotel. It was so good we booked via A quick email to Youssef for a different adventure a few days later. Again we were picked up bang on time and off we went to the palms. This morning was even better than the first. Achmed was our guide this time and we had a ball, crazy running through the desert and palms as well as some impromptu tracks and up some rocky hills. Safety always came first but we were also allowed to really have fun. We have quad biked in many countries around the world but this was the best by far. Thanks Youssef, Achmed and Mafoud for the best days ever. Worth every penny and the best dirty sweaty fun you can have. Excellent communication from start to finish with a great company."

Booking was made from UK before the trip and everything ran like clockwork. Picked up on time from hotel. Private tour arranged. It was a truly brilliant experience. Several stops for drinks and photos. The route is well planned as its gentle while you get used to the quads - then difficulty and speed increases if you feel up to it. It was great - and I'm the anxious mum who was the only one who was a little nervous!!! I'd do it again instantly if I get the chance. Great value for money. Drive your own quad - don't be a passenger. It's really easy and such fun. Thank you to our guide - we have amazing photos and 4 teens nagging us to go again!!!!!"

No hard sale, gave you all the info, pricing and patiently answered additional queries.My son and myself have been picked up from our hotel on the agreed date 23/07/2015 and time from our hotel and been driven to the lake. We decided to do the lake and Agafay desert trip at 65 euros each. It is not cheap but well worth the money. We were given instructions and a quick demo than we were split into small groups. I must say I was slightly nervous as I have never done this before however I needn't worry as we had a wonderful young man taking very good care of us throughout the trip. We felt safe and in good hands. It was great driving through the different terrains and even a local village. We stopped a few times and our guide has patiently taken several photos. We were provided with plenty of water and even cola from a road side cafe. At the end we had the opportunity to try some local crepes with apricot jam and mint tea. Loved the local cafe, beautifully decorated and top hospitality. Youssef has taken the time to chat to all the guests afterwards which again was a very nice touch to the top quality service we have been provided. I cannot recommend this trip highly enough. Don't be scared, go try something new and have loads of fun."

After a short while our guide realised that all of our small group only 5 quads could ride (very fortunate) and the pace picked up Flat Out!!!

Communication with Youssef before the trip was excellent: I originally made the booking for 14 people but changed it a couple of times as some people dropped out and others opted in, and he was always quick to respond and his English is great. On the day itself we got picked up on time from our riad in two comfortable jeeps and taken about 30 minutes outside of Marrakech to the Agafay desert. Most of us had never done quad biking before but we got the hang of it pretty quickly and enjoyed a couple of hours on an excellent route over dirt tacks, scrub land and through a nice old village before ending near a beautiful lake. The views of the Atlas mountains were amazing throughout so I'd recommend it for this alone. The quads can get up to a good pace and the route can be fairly challenging in places if you've not done quad biking before, but if you're up for this kind of thing I'm sure you'll love it."

The trip itself was excellent and wasn't just on flat ground and was up and down hills making the driving interesting and fun. It lasted for about 2 hours and the views were sensational with a few good photo opportunities.After this we went for a very nice crepe and mint tea overlooking the lake.All in all a great trip and would definitely recommend these guys/company for quad biking.Ian (North East, England)."

We booked this the day before the trip an booking was easy, just exchanged a few emails and were picked up from the hotel the next day. Had a brief tutorial on how the quads worked and then 5 minutes of driving an a circle to get the hang of it. Then we were off, this is were the fun begins, we were lead on a trail through the desert area, over bumps, around trunks, through towns, and then up a hill for a great view. The guide was great constant looking back to make sure everyone was doing well and keeping up. He adjusted the speed depending on how fast we were keeping up. It really fulfilled the ability to go fast, and also to go over bumps and through varied terrain. The tracks used were obvious and there were many other groups of quads within this area, but there were so many trails we never interest cited with any of them. Despite having 20 people booked that morning for the trip we were all split into small groups of 4-5 which made it really fun. Half way through you have some tea at a charming house in one of the local villages, and a nice western style bathroom is there. Then you are lead through a small obstacle type course with some really fun bumps and turns, then back to the main area. They then get some of the dust of with an air hose that helps to clean clothes and shoes. I have done this before while traveling and the quads were in rough shape, these quads are in great shape, work well, are fast, and look fairly new which was very nice. It was a great experience a very fun trip and definitely one of our highlights."

            "review": "\"Things to do before you die!\". Youssef and his team are extremely professional and friendly making you feel welcome from the moment they pick you up from your Riad (included in price). We changed our booking a couple of times and Youssef was very accommodating in this regard. Due to a local festival no one had booked in for the afternoon group so rather than move us Youssef gave us our own personal tour (just our small group of 4!). Our tour was lead by our extremely friendly guide also called \"Youssef\" who showed us the ropes and then we were off winding through the desert and small Berber villages. There was a stop to get a panoramic view of the desert and take pics (Youssef was somewhat of budding photographer!) You can also go for a mule ride but we opted out on that as it's not our thing. Next stop was in a Berber village for some lovely local Moroccan \"Whiskey!\" (aka. sweet mint tea!) Then it was blast going through the small dunes and Oasis again stopping for photo shoots with Youssef! Once back at the HQ you're power sprayed with air to rid you of the coating of dust and sand (my brand new airmax were caked! and then suddenly brand new again!) Overall it was an amazing day and one that i would recommend for anyone visiting Marrakech! - a MASSIVE tick off the 'Bucket List' - Thank you Youssef & Youssef and the rest of the guys at Quad Evasion it was worth every cent!!!"

Yousseff the friendly boss-man picked myself and my girlfriend up from our Riad and took us out into the sticks to where the bikes live.A quick session of 'this is how you go, and how you stop' and we were on our way. Through the dessert, along dry riverbeds, and up hills, the lot. I have ridden quads before, but the pace was good enough to keep me entertained, while my first timer girlfriend didn't feel rushed or unsafe on her own bike.Stopped for a quick sweet tea in a funny little village halfway along and then back to it.No complaints at all.. Although we did spot the guide smoking something cheeky looking during our rest break.. But he still led us all safely regardless.Very dusty, don't wear white.Very hot, do take water.Also, don't act like a silly bugger. There was another group who got back at the same time as us who got slapped with a fine for rolling and crashing their quads. By all accounts they deserved it.. So mustn't grumble."

We organised the excursion over email beforehand for the 1/2 day quad biking in the palm grove & Marrakech desert. Pickup from the hotel was easy & we were with another couple from London who were lovely. We were left at the quad base by Youssef our guide, who explained before he went how to work the bikes. We were fitted with helmets and we were off with the quad bike leader. This was the first time I had been quad biking & it was so much fun! The scenery was beautiful, apart from one section this is just dry land areas & not sand. The palm grove oasis is wonderful & the stop in the middle for tea is nice to give your bum a break from the bikes!Had an excellent time & it was great value for money. Would definitely use them again."

            "review": "Mini Moroccan Adventure!Totally recommend.. Booked Quad Biking Evasion for my husband and I by a simple email. We paid at the end of the excursion.They were punctual and picked us up from our hotel and they dropped us back as agreed.When I arrived it looked like barren land then I saw the quad biking area which is where we had a short briefing on instructions and safety. The quads are really simple to use as there are only basic functions brakes like accelerate and brake etc so I did not feel nervous (as I initially had). Helmets and hairnets are all provided.As a group, we stopped at a small Berber village where they offered us mint tea(extremely sweet as expected in Marrakech but it felt well deserved and a satisfying break). There I saw the small children who are so adorable and seem oblivious that we had stopped by their village(I\u2019m assuming the children are used to seeing tourists but I felt privileged to be able to be involved in their everyday lives.) I bought some sweets from a shop an old man owned and the children were so excitable when I shared them out. I definitely feel this was a great memory and due to the quad biking excursion was able to experience this.After leaving the village we continued on. The best part of the quad biking is the feel of the Moroccan sun hitting your body whilst riding across the dusty land and absorbing the beautiful scenery around. I did manage to trail off at one point when taking a turn but that was because I was trying to be a daredevil and I learnt speeding around bumps or turns is not a great idea! I would advise not to take turns fast for obvious reasons but if you feel worried there is no need as the instructor is always checking his group members are safe and I noticed he frequently did head counts.After quad biking my husband and I, each had a one hour ride on the camel which was really relaxing. I would suggest trying and having the camel ride booked after around 4pm as even though the ride is relaxing, the blazing heat did affect me. Quad biking really made my trip in Marrakech and the team at Quad Biking Evasion are friendly, organised and I recommend this to anyone who wants to have a mini Moroccan adventure.\u20ac65 each, for 2 hours quad biking and one hour camel ride. Worth every euro!"

We were highly delighted with the service which was provided, we were picked form our apartment in a nice clean mini-bus with A/C and traditional pleasant music the driver was very nice, polite and punctual. We were greeted by Youssef when we arrived he gave us an introduction on how to use and drive the quad bikes, where and what we will encounter on the way. The quad bikes were clean, excellent working condition, really easy to operate, helmets with sanitary hairnets and goggles were also provided. There was brief practice period with our guide and put in small groups of 5-6 quad bikes this gave us an opportunity to mix and meet new people. Our guide was very vigilant kept making sure everyone was safe and kept the weak drivers close to him. We drove through the dessert which was combined with sand, stones and plants which made the drive interesting. We stopped at a hill which had some stunning views overlooked Marrakech and opportunity to take some pictures. Then we made our way back to the small village where we had some amazing traditional green tea which was all included within the price. After that we made our way back to base to go on doing camel riding. This again was outstanding, well organized. After camel riding Youssef came to pick us up in his stunning 4x4 and took us back to our apartment. Youssef was a very nice person he was very friendly and welcoming throughout the day he constantly made sure we had a good time not even once he mentioned or asked us regarding money.I would highly recommend Quad Evasion to all I can guarantee you will have a fabulous time and won\u2019t be disappointed.

Thank you!Booking was quick and easy via e-mail - responses from Youssef were very quick, mine were slow due to dodgy wifi at our hotel, but we booked in the next morning with no problems. No pressure to pay up front so felt very safe.Pick from hotel included in price, punctual, courteous, air conditioned.Intersting drive through marrakech and out the other side to the base. (Our hotel was out of town on the airport side) transfer for us about 40 mins. Quicker if you start in town.Quad bikes looked new, functioned well, easy automatics. Some for singles some larger for two. We had the bigger one and were fine with two on board. Helmets with sanitary hairnets, goggles etc, all included.Quick, effective multilingual instruction and brief practice period. Our young guide was very vigilant throughout the trip, placed those with kids closest to him and kept looking around to check all okay.Terrain fun, exciting to drive over, interesting to look at. This was just a half day trip, mind, just a quick go. The 'desert' planted with wheat, pale lilac flowers, bright red poppies, a camel trip over in the distance, smiling kids in quiet villages. A brief pause for photos atop a small hill - gorgeous views - then down and on towards a glass of mint tea in a village. All included. Knick knacks for sale here but quite surprised by lack of pressure to buy (we'd been to the souks, so were prepared,) Only then do i realise i haven't even paid for the trip yet. Youssef obviously trusts his clientele.Back to base and an intriguing method of blasting some of the dust from our clothes via a gizmo that blows pressurised air. Ineffective, but a nice attempt! Very much enjoyed our trip back to the hotel, again, any drive here gives plenty to see if you love maroccan architecture...Thanks, Youssef, you deserve your high ranking!"

Although we had a great time, we didn't give it 5 stars as we felt that the village stopping point was a bit dull, although recognise that it is probably good to have a restroom stop. Also, there possibly could have been some more in depth information given out before we headed out or whilst we stopped to tell us a bit more about the areas we were seeing.Overall, we recommend it highly and would definitely do it again!

Always felt safe and in control and the bikes looked well kept. A number of opportunities to get photos and our guide was excellent, taking photos of all of us. Me and my husband had shared a bike and for the last bit back to base our guide said I could drive his bike with him on the back which was a really nice touch. If I could give the team 10 stars I would. The price was also cheaper than the touts in the market and no haggling needed so don't waste your time.

Beautiful scenery, exciting ride, only problem I wish I had one more day on my trip to go again. Youssef, our guide, was one of the friendlist guys we met in Morocco. Always a smile on his face, always excited. He picked us from the riad in his 4X4 and took us to the location.We were trained, provided with all the safety equipment, and off we went. The guides were great, always keeping an eye on the riders making sure everything is ok. It was my first time doing this, and I had a blast and felt super safe.All in all, you can't go wrong with these guys. Take a break from the souqs and try a quad out."

Even though our group was small, and the rest of our group was running late, Yusuf sent us off with our guide. The trip was REALLY cool, and you get to see Berber villages, amazing desert landscape, and even an oasis area. We had a nice stop at one of the villages for afternoon tea. Everyone was very friendly, and our guide was enthusiastic and thoughtful. I really enjoyed it. Highly recommended!"

Once again Mohamed and his team organised an excellent week\u2019s trekking through traditional High Atlas villages, this time in the secluded Azzadene and Imenane valleys (near Imlil). The trekking was along easy tracks amid splendid scenery; there are enticing paths over high passes for those fitter than myself. There was time to explore the villages in the afternoon; the rocky thoroughfares sometimes needing a bit of agility to negotiate. It was interesting to see the walnut harvest being gathered in and other aspects of village life. Accommodation was in basic g\u00eetes (there is no other); there were showers in some and plenty of space, as there were few other trekkers around. The guiding and food were excellent thanks to Omar (guide) and Mohamed (cook and muleteer). Omar spoke good English and knew the area well. Transfer between the two valleys was by car.As usual, it was a most enjoyable and well organised week and I look forward to further trekking with this company. Thanks again to Mohamed, Omar and Mohamed.CarolMLondon"

Drank some mint tea and set out on a 3/4 hour walk. Abdul was great, explaining things about life in Imlil, the culture and he set a pace we were able to keep up with. He took us up to a great spot which had a view of the entire valley and of Mount Toubkal. We went through small villages, drank tea by a waterfall and finished with a 3 course lunch in a riad which had the most stunning views of the mountains. The food was delicious and the whole day was worth every penny. Our only regret was that we were doing a day trip rather than a longer adventure.

Mohammed was very accommodating by fulfilling our request to change our itinerary on very short notice after we had some issue with an international flight connection. We saw the high Atlas, historical Kasbah's, the Gorges, spent the night in the Sahara and saw everything in between, along with every type of climate -- a wonderful experience. All of this with our fantastic guide - Faysel. I cannot say enough about Faysel, he was knowledgeable, had excellent English language skills and seemingly boundless energy. He went above and beyond in every regard to explain the sites and answer our questions about Moroccan culture. He made the extra effort to take photos for us and even ran ahead in the Sahara to capture great shots of us. I would definitely seek him out on my next trip."

Perfectly organized - we got picked up at our Riad and transfered to our second hotel after the trek, the crew was very friendly and especially for our three kids, who were very enthousiastic about the trip, the mules and the guides. Be aware that it can get very cold in the mountains (we underdressed a little). The overnight accomodation was rather primitive, but the setting (a berber village beautifully located in the mountains, with lots of kids around who were more than happy to play with our childrenthat our children could play with all afternoon) made up for that. Recommended!"

Four intrepid trekkers joined Mohamed for four days of intense trekking first, and then the rest joined the group for two more days (6-7 hours of hiking/day). Mohamed and his team led the treks each day, prepared and served delicious lunches and dinners, and organized local accommodations for the group to spend the night(s). The accommodations were very rustic/authentic (read: no heat and primitive bathroom facilities) but perfect for our needs. He and his band of merry men even sang and played local musical instruments for our entertainment in the evening. His organization is extremely professional, he and his team are fit, detail-oriented, and tireless. I highly recommend Active Treks Morocco."

Mohammed was very professional from the time I contacted him via E-mail. I was picked up from my Riad on-time and was given all relevant information or asked for any required changes by Mohammed and the wonderful guide Hussain. Mohammed and his team of people are local Berbers, so they know all about Atlas!. Hussain, again a Berber gave me wonderful insights into the lives of the Berbers in the Imlil and Imnane valleys, where I did a circuit hike. So it was much more than just a simple hiking experience, which made this hike rather personally enriching, needless to say the landscape, views, mountain passes and those little smiling children in the villages all added to the magic of this place. Overall, a fantastic experience, thanks to Mohammed!. I would recommend these guys to anyone interested in getting to know real people with a passion for the mountains!. well done!"

In March 2016 I organised a trek for 25 friends; the challenge was that we were 2 groups, a smaller one that wanted to do a longer and harder trek and a bigger one that wanted to join only for the last 2 days and do an easier trek. Mohamed understood the spirit and put together a fantastic program, challenging (8-10 hours walking a day, crampons and ice picks at times, etc) but always 100% safe for the first group and interesting and well crafted for the second group. I have trekked a lot in the high Himalayas and the Andes - always \"self made\" treks - but I have never experienced such a perfect organisation, such kind and helpful porters and muleteers and especially I never had such a amazingly professional, experienced and at the same time caring, friendly and gentle guide as Abdul Rahim: a real \" Berber Chief\"!! THANK YOU ALL FOR AN UNFORGETTABLE EXPERIENCE!!"

Due to snow blocking high passes in the Atlas mountains (mid-February), a planned week\u2019s trekking in the Amsouzarte Valley and Lac d\u2019Ifni area had to be hastily re-arranged. Mohamed and his team soon came up with another itinerary, based in Imi n\u2019Talla and Ait Zitoun villages, on the northern edge of the Atlas. The bad weather was avoided and the days were pleasantly Spring-like, although the nights were very cold. The accommodation was in g\u00eetes that were basic and unheated, but plenty of warm blankets were provided. Guide Driss spoke good English and knew the area well. The walks were mostly on easy paths and were of a good length. Driss understands the needs of photographers, and was very patient when it came to standing around waiting. He also has some interest in geology, and a wealth of general knowledge about the area.I have booked with this company several times previously and highly recommend them. As usual, the transport was reliable, the food good and the guide excellent. Accommodation in Marrakech, at each end of the trip, was in a hotel and a riad, and was also excellent.Thanks to Mohamed and Driss. I look forward to booking another trip later this year.Carol M, London"

In October 2014 I was part of a small recce party that worked with Mohammed organising a Scout expedition to climb Toubkal the following October, from the get go Mo was excellent, nothing was too much trouble and I think being the premiert guide in that area he knew all the best deals for cost saving while not skimping on safety and had the best people working for him. The expedition party of 20 older scouts arrived in Morocco in October 15 at the airport in Marrakech where minibuses were waiting to take us up to Mohammed's own guest house which I have to say was very nice. The following morning it was off on an acclimatisation hike to a near by tizzi where we stopped for lunch, back at the guest house we settled down to preparing our kit had a nice evening meal then it was an early night. Next morning it was off to the refuge Mouflons which in our humble opinion is the better of the two up there. This is a six hour day but as you are not carrying kit ( its on mules ) this wasn't a chore. Mohammed and hios guides were attentive at all times. Long story short we had two nights at the refuge and a successful summit, we then spent an evening in a guest house down in the valley before taking minibuses back to Marakech where we stayed in the Hotel Gomassine which was very nice and had a swimming pool which was welcolme. During our time in Marrakech Mohammed had organised two evening meals for us - one in a rooftop restraunt overlooking the main square and another also at the main square but with a belly dancer, Also organised for us was a quad bike safari and a camel ride both of which were really enjoyed. All together a brilliant trip, well organised and a credit to Mohammed. If you are thinking of running a similar trip or one on a smaller scale Mohammed Maachou is the go to guy, highly recommended."

We were picked up from our hotel in Marrakech and transported to Imlil where we met our guide. Imlil is a cute mountain town though, and it might have been fun to stay there for a night! Day 1 of hiking was wonderful - our guide was a man of few words, but we felt safe nonetheless. We spent the night at the refuge which was better than usual hike accommodations. The dining room was heated, and dinner was wonderful! There were even decent bathrooms in the refuge. The sleeping arrangements were tough (10 of us in a room, and it was pretty cold), but nothing out of the ordinary for overnight hikes. We began Day 2 using our cell phones for light (as we started before the sun rose) which I felt was probably not the safest plan, but we were only hiking like that for about 30-45 minutes until there was enough natural light to put our phones away. I would probably recommend bringing a head lamp. The summit was beyond beautiful. Totally worth it. We had a plentiful lunch on the way down and then an easy transfer back to Marrakech at the end of Day 2. A very smoothly organized trip, and an awesome hike. The three hours up to the summit were challenging, but if you like challenging hikes without too much overnight camping, this is a great choice!"

Especially as we discovered our sleeping bags had been left at the airport in the UK. Mohamed went out of his way to ensure we had adequate bedding at all our stops.His guiding was exemplary and knowledge of the mountains flora and fauna really added to the experience. Always calm and eager to help our experience of Morocco under his friendly guidance was one to be savoured.The best way to sum him up is just to say he's a classy guy."

            "review": "Mohamed Maachou is hands-down the BEST!!!. We visited Morocco in September 2010 with Semester at Sea (SAS). My husband and I were SAS staff trip leaders for a group of over 60 undergraduate college students and lifelong learners. Mohamed was the lead guide for our group on a 4-day hike into the Atlas Mountains. Here's a quote from the blog post we wrote about our trip back in 2010: Mohamed is \"a walking, talking, joking encyclopedia of knowledge about history, culture, religion, the Moroccan monarchy, flora, fauna, geography, you name it. He seemed to be able to speak on nearly any subject we brought up. He was born and raised in a rural Chleh village on the other side of the mountains from our hiking expedition.\" Someone who clearly loves his country and loves his job, Mohamed was instrumental not only in guiding us through the Atlas Mountains to visit several beautiful Chleh villages and many kind Chleh people, he really taught us about Morocco and the Moroccan way of life. He went above and beyond to ensure that all of our group members had an amazing time--all the logistics (planes, trains, bus rides, mule trains, etc. were taken care of). Ours was a trip not for tourists, but for travelers--some visiting a predominantly Muslim country for the first time. We were there to experience Morocco, spend time with Moroccans, and to learn about the country's geography, culture and history. Mohamed found us wild fresh pomegranates while we were hiking and passed them out to everyone. We ate delicious Moroccan meals under shade trees and in gites and enjoyed dinner, drum circles, and dancing with Moroccan families who live in the mountains. We slept in the fresh air at the \"Hotel of a Thousand Stars\" as Mohamed called it. You really can see the entire Milky Way out there. It was magical, it was beautiful, it was the experience of a lifetime. Our students were so positively affected by this trip that almost all of them rated it THE highlight of their entire 4-month SAS experience--and we did as well. Whether you are looking for luxury or looking to rough it, if you are going to Morocco and you want to visit the Atlas Mountains or another area of the country, do yourself a favor and skip the touristy stuff. Instead, be a traveler with Mohamed! He will make sure that you experience the beautiful, magical country of Morocco and its people in ways you never could any other way."

Our hiking guide himself, Mohamed, was delightful\u2014his English was good, and we always felt like we were in good hands. We did the 3-day hike in the Atlas Mountains (not the climb up Mt. Toubkal, although we were still at a pretty high altitude the whole time). There is an experience unlike any other. The insanely beautiful views, the tiny villages you hike directly through, the mule (which carries all your baggage, sleeping bags, and food)\u2014there isn't much like it. Chef Hasan cooked TONS of good food for us\u2014at least three or four courses for every meal, and not insubstantial ones: delicious salads, tagines, soups, fresh fruit, tons of mint tea. We felt embarrassed at how much was provided, and we were definitely never less than stuffed.Bring good, broken-in hiking boots: You'll be hiking 4+ hours the first day, 6+ hours the second day, and 6+ hours the third day. The hikes are not for beginners\u2014there are some steep, slippery climbs and descents, not to mention a few stream crossings on rocks that require good balance. Keep in mind that you'll stay in refuges in the (very) rural towns; refuges are guesthouses with a few rooms and very basic amenities. They're definitely not luxurious; in one of the two we stayed in, there were only squat toilet (but a nice hot shower). These are not luxury hotels, but they are clean, and they are a unique experience.Do this hike\u2014it was definitely one of the most memorable experiences we had in all of Morocco!"

This time to Sidi-Kaouki (via Essaouira) on the Atlantic coast, for a lovely valley walk to the shrine of Sidi-M\u2019barak, and then over dunes and headlands and along long stretches of beautiful deserted beaches. It\u2019s a windy place, with a strong north wind that builds up in the late afternoon, and is popular with surfers. Then down the coast towards Agadir, with stops at attractive spots along the coast, and inland to Imouzz\u00e8r-des-Ida-Outanane for short walks and a visit to the Cascades. Continuing towards Amizmiz we made a diversion down the Assif el Mall valley to see interesting villages and to have tea with locals. Next, an overnight stay near the village of Aguergour where there was sky diving (to watch!). Then over the Kik Plateau, covered in poppies and with views of snow-covered Jebel Toubkal and the Atlas range, to Imlil for a few days of local walks. The trip was full of interest and variety, but maybe a bit more walking and less time on the road would have been welcome. Food and accommodation were very good throughout, the transport and drivers were reliable and the guides were excellent - professional, knowledgeable about the area and good company. As usual I was well looked after; I have always felt secure on these trips, which I much appreciate, particularly as I travel solo. Very many thanks to guides Mustapha and Mohamed, and also to Mohamed at Active Treks Morocco for organising the trip. I am looking forward to my next trip to which will be a trek in the Amsouzarte Valley and to Lac d\u2019Ifni later in the year. Carol M, London"

Then we were walking between interesting villages where cherry and apple trees were in bloom, the colours were fantastic and white peaks all around. We had a very good English-speaking guide, Mohamed, and another Mohamed was the cook, with a mule carrying the food, sleeping bags etc. For lunch they prepared fantastic salad and tajines, and the ever present Moroccan tea. We stayed overnight in a basic guesthouse in one of the villages, where we enjoyed excellent dinner and breakfast. It was a wonderful trip, not easy for everybody - as this is not a leisurely stroll but a hike in mountains, but it was very pleasant though, and a fantastic experience - higly recommended.

I contacted Mohamed by Email and he agreed to organise our visit to the mountains. At 0830hrs promptly our driver Laarsen picked us at our Riad in the Medina in Marrakesh. It didn\u2019t take long in Laarsens Toyota 4 wheel drive to escape the busy city streets and be on our way across the plains towards the High Atlas Mountains. We had great views of the snow covered peaks and could clearly see Jebel Toubkal. We stopped briefly at the Women\u2019s Cooperative in Tahnaout to see a demonstration of the process for producing Argen Oil. Then on through Asni to Imlil at just after 10 o\u2019clock. Waiting to meet us was our young guide Abdeslam and after a quick comfort stop we were heading out of town and towards the Mountains. We were soon to see our first but not last Mule head up the mountain and then we were shown a greater spotted woodpecker and on the next tree Levaillants green woodpecker only found in the high mountains of northwest Africa. The weather was perfect, sunny and not too warm, we walked steadily onwards and upwards stopping to see more birds and take in the incredible views of the snow covered High Atlas and of the almond and peach blossom. Abdeslam pointed out the various Walnut, Apple, Cherry, Poplar and other types of tree. We were told April and May are the best time for the Alpine flowers which appear in profusion. We crossed the river and climbed through the village to our high point at about 2000 metres about level with the snow line.We then walked to Mohamed\u2019s house we had a wonderful lunch on the roof terrace watching fly catchers and blackbird\u2019s in the trees around us. Moroccan Salad and Lentils followed by meat tagine with fresh local apples to follow. As we finished our meal Mohamed returned from the Mountain refuge with a Canadian couple who ascended the peak the day before. It was great to catch up again and we had a wonderful time talking about the mountains.Too soon it was time bid goodbye to walk back town and meet Laarsen and thank Abdeslam (Abdul) for his wonderful company. On the way back to our Riad we saw Stalks and Kites and stopped briefly in Asni for pictures of the Camels.Marilyn was really pleased with our wonderful day a true taste of mountain life and of wonderful mountain people. Thanks Again Mohamed"

We stopped on the way to see a local market, which we really appreciated as it was so different to anything we had seen before. Then we reached at the waterfalls. There were a lot of local guides waiting there, and our driver picked one of them. The guide spoke good english and took us on a nice hike from one side of the waterfall to the other. We saw monkeys on the way. Then we had lunch with a great view of the waterfall. In the end the driver took us back to the Riad. Overall we absolutely enjoyed the waterfalls, but we felt that we might have as well driven there ourselves and got one of the local guides there to show us around."

He had used a major trekking company to explore the atlas mountains and summit Toubkal last spring. This time he and Mohamed (from Active Reks Morocco) created an independant trek for a winter summit of Toubkal. From the start Mohamed had catered for every aspect of the trip. Airport transfer, lunch and mules to the first nights accommodation. A 4 bedroom Gite that Mohamed owns himself right at the foot of the Atlas range.This experience for me is at the top of things I've done and I have no doubt this is in no small part due to Mohamed and he all encompassing organisation!His skills as a guide are unmatched and the weather we encountered put those skills to the test.I can not state how highly I recommend Mohamed and his company!"

We were picked up from the airport, stopped for tea on the way to Imlil and basically being looked after all the time. We stayed in great riad in Imlil and had a enjoyable trek with beautiful scenery. Unfortunately due to awful weather conditions we had to turn back before reaching the summit.

We were collected from our riad in Marrakesh and had a wonderful drive ( about an hour and a half) to the start point of the trek. Our driver was great - he told us stories of famous climbers, mountain dramas etc - very entertaining. The walk itself was great - it was perfectly pitched - enough steepness at the start to make us think that we might have done some proper exercise, then incredible panoramic views, and slow descent through Berber villages. Our guide was absolutely charming - very gentle and thoughtful, and very knowledgeable. We walked for about 3.5 hours then had a later lunch which was delicious and huge! We had a lounge around in the sun afterwards before returning to Marrakesh. It was a perfect day and I would absolutely recommend anyone to include a 1 or 2 day trek with this company in their itinery. Marrakesh can be full on and so the opportunity to have a day out from the frantic pace of the souks should not be missed. We will absolutely do this again - probably for a couple of days next time."

The trek we took included a climb to the second highest peak in the area which was actually more fun to climb than Toubkal although harder. Well worth doing though if you get chance. Along with the cook which joined us and another guide (also called Mohammed) the whole trip was a success - just once piece of advice, never play cards with Mohammed, he is remarkably good at calling your bluff. All in all, a great trip and I would recommend him to anyone. Everything just ran smoothly and meant the only thing you had to concentrate on was getting up the mountain. Thanks again for everything.

I went on a bespoke 3-day trek organised by Mohamed and it was faultless in every way.He was responsive to my many emails and flexible to make any changes I wanted for the trip - number of people, days, travel arrangements, overnight locations. Nothing was too much trouble and all handled with the minimum of fuss.When I said I wanted a challenging 3-day trek on specific dates, Mohamed organised transport, a guide, chef, mule (to carry the food) and accommodation. All I had to do was show up in Marrakech and everything else was laid out for me. My guide, Hossain, was friendly and eager to adapt to any changes I wanted. He laid out a basic plan for the 3 days but adjusted the itinerary on the fly if we reached our destination early and I wanted to do more. He made all the arrangements for meeting the chef and mule for lunch / dinner each day and changed accommodation bookings when I opted for a change in plans. During the trek, he was very considerate of my needs and was the perfect guide - professional, friendly and very knowledgable of the area (given that he was local!). Because I wanted a challenging 3 days, he was happy to get up before 5am to start our treks and carried the food himself when our lunch spot was inaccessible to the mule. He kept a perfect pace for me and I learned a lot about technique for quick, efficient hiking both up and down mountains ('surfing' down the mountain was the highlight of my trip - thank you Hossain - just amazing!).At home, I stick to a Paleo diet, but wasn't expecting these needs to be met on the trip. But after a casual conversation about food on the first day, Hossain must have informed our chef (also called Mohamed) and every meal from that point was Paleo. He even made vegetable soup from scratch as a starter for my evening meals. Another example of customer service surpassing expectations. When we finished on the last day, Hossain phoned ahead to ensure a taxi was waiting for me at our finishing point to take me to the airport. However, as I had a few hours before my flight, I enquired about a massage for my aching body. Nothing was too much trouble. I was taken to central Marrakech where Mohamed met me and took me to a local Hammam Massage facility where they gave me a discount for being one of Mohamed's clients. Mohamed took care of my backpack and arranged the taxi to take me from the Massage place to the airport.Again, flawless organisation from start to finish, so efficient and professional, meeting every requirement with no fuss.Mohamed, Hossain, thank you. If I was able to give you a rating of more than 5 stars, I would. I have recommended you to everyone I know who thinking about doing such a trip. I would not think of speaking to anyone else if I organise a Sahara trip or return to Marrakech in the future."

One of the best things about Mohamed, apart from feeling in safe hands, is that he is willing to answer all our questions.

He drove us around 1000 kilometres in three days and his driving was flawless.The other Abdellah was very chatty, and spoke a few languages. He was a good organiser and quickly found an extra room when he wanted a room of his own.The desert was wonderful. We saw the sunrise and sunset and slept in a tent at the edge of the dunes.We arrived a little late, though at 8pm and then waited nearly three hours for our food.Riding the camels was an experience, which was calming, It was so quiet.Thank you Mohamed"

The trips were amazing and we were never rushed through anything - we were able to take our time en route to take pictures of the landscape and we could choose where we wanted / didn't want to visit - so were never pressurised to purchase anything! The guide was always prompt, friendly and accommodating, doing everything to ensure we were having the best time possible.

The daily climbs had fantastic views and the overnight stays were unique, but enjoyable. Mohammad, our guide, I cannot say enough good thing about him. Very knowledgeable and friendly guy. He met the climbers where they were at physically and did not go beyond anyone's limitations. With that said, I never felt slowed down or irriated in any way. In short, I recommend the winter climb. It was challenging, not technical. After spending a copious amount of time with Mohammad and his team, I am considering coming back and checking out the Sahara Desert. Great experience."

At the end of last month (March) I returned from a 5-day visit to the Ait Bouguemez Valley, followed by a 2-day visit to Bin El Ouidane, arranged by Mohamed Maachou of Active Treks Morocco, which was very well organised and enjoyable. The Valley is within the M\u2019Goun National Park and encompasses around 30 traditional Atlas Mountain villages with lush green fields and orchards set against a backdrop of snow-topped mountains. My visit was just a bit too early for the fruit trees to be in bloom, which I\u2019m sure must look stunning. There is easy walking through fields and along hillsides, and more challenging routes over passes for those fitter than myself. Hamid, my guide, knew the area very well as he is a local. There is an ancient granary on the top of a steep conical hill with a panoramic view. The interior of the granary is open to tourists and has a custodian (also ancient; he claimed to be 110). We visited another site of interest at the village of Ibakliwine, where dinosaur tracks can be seen preserved in the rock strata. The area is quite remote, and we came across few other tourists although there are several g\u00eetes. I stayed at the Ecolodge which was comfortable, with en-suite showers, and good food. It was cold at night, but there was a wood fire in the saloon and some heating in the rooms. At Bin El Ouidane there is a large lake and hydro-electric dam. Approaching from Azilal there are superb views over the lake, and the dam is at the head of a superb rocky gorge. Photography is prohibited around the dam and adjacent areas. There is fishing available in the lake for those interested. I stayed in a guest house with an attractive garden and a good view of the river and gorge. There didn\u2019t appear to be much walking in the near vicinity, apart from a track along the top of the gorge that gave good views. The Ouzoud Falls were visited en route back to Marrakesh and are worth seeing. It appears that it is very busy here later in the season. This was the sixth trip that I have booked through Mohamed and once again the guide, walking, transport, accommodation and food were all excellent, and the itinerary was varied and interesting. I am now planning my next trip, which will be a trek along part of the Atlantic coast, later this year. Many thanks, once again, to Mohamed and to Hamid. Carol M, London"

Our trek started out in auspicious conditions: we set off in high spirits under speedwell-blue skies in glorious sunshine, confident in our abilities to meet all the challenges of this exciting adventure. As we climbed towards the snow line, admiring vistas of delicate cherry and apple blossom around the village if Aroumd to the North, and the snow-capped peaks to the South, our group began to gel, so that when we arrived at the Neltner refuge, we already felt in the company of good friends. This proved to be of vital importance as, overnight, the weather changed: the wind accelerated to gale-force and 30cms of snow fell, ensuring that, far from making the Toubkal ascent the following morning, we were hut-bound the entire day. However, we already had every confidence in the wisdom and excellent leadership of our guides, Mohamed and Hussein, who were both towers of strength when we did make the ascent the following day in clear but challenging conditions. Hussein set a perfect pace, kicking steps into the deep powder snow, while Mohamed was vigilant in his care and attention; his leadership was faultless and we trusted him implicitly. Both on the mountains and back in Marrakech, his attention to detail was immaculate and nothing was too much trouble; he gave a very professional yet personal service, delivered with good humour and patience. His impressive command of English and knowledge of the terrain and its flora and fauna, together with his calm, good-humoured and easy demeanour made him the perfect travelling companion and guide. Thanks, Mohamed, for making the trip so hugely enjoyable and such a success. Thanks must also go to Hussein the Cook, for his fabulous food!"

The Berbers are very friendly people and throughout my holiday I always felt safe and in good hands. I was fortunate that the group was small and we all got on reasonably well.

At the salt works near Tassa Ouirgane I saw the brine wells and evaporation ponds that are operated by local families, and I was also able to visit the rock salt mine near Telouet. Then there was a visit to the mosque at Tinmel to see its beautiful 12th century Islamic architecture. The interior, which is partly restored, is open to tourists and is of some splendour, although most of the roof is now missing. The trip finished with a pleasantly enjoyed afternoon and morning in Essaouira, with its lively and photogenic harbour, albeit after a rather long drive there and then back to Marrakech. The accommodation in the villages was basic, but staying with the locals was interesting, and the riad at Essaouria and hotel at Marrakech were comfortable. The transport arrangements were very reliable and Hassan was a careful driver. Abdou was an excellent guide who knows the area well; he found things I was interested in and some good photographic venues.

Not an easy walk in the park this is a rewarding one over 4000m peaks and on/over (very windy) ridges, beautiful skylines and amazing vistas/colours. During the day you might sometimes curse the steep intervals but once back in the camp all the hardship is quickly forgotten as the cook and muleteers had already prepared camp and delicious food was waiting for our hungry stomachs.I can surely recommend this trip as Mohamed is a great experienced guide, and he and his team make this walk a very nice experience.Go for it!"

He was very professional form the begging answering all my questions, doubts and quickly replying to all my mails. The trek was absolutely great and despite of the bad weather we had on the day of the last trek and that we could not reach the top, I had an amazing and unforgettable trip that I will surely repeat one day! I was guided by Mohamed's brother (Abdou) who made me feel safe at all times. His knowledge of the mountains and the Valley is incredible and in addition to the awesome trekking, I learnt a lot of the local culture and people. Thank you, Mohamed for organizing this trip for me!! It was exactly what I wanted and what I needed!"

The idea of trekking with a caravan of mules seems strange for European trekkers, but the more you let yourself be taken in, the more you love it :) The scent of hot mint tea cooked fresh for you in an imporvised camp in the middle of the route - fantastic.We finished Atlas trek in Imlil, in Mohammed's guesthouse - which has a million dollar view onto the Toubkal peak - the best in Imlil! Mohammed was a wonderfull host, we felt as if visiting a friend.After the Atlas trek we travelled along the Sahara north to Merzouga - visiting the magnificent gorges and canyouns on the way. The car was super comfirtable and big, since we were only 3 people. Our guide was very knowledgable and friendly, explaining the other possible treks in the areas we passed by.The only feedback we would geve to Mohammed, would be not to stay in the tipical tourist restaurants, where the \"big buses\" eat - that's the only place where Maroccan food tastes bad.As for the camel trek in Merzouga - it was a lot of fun:) But Mohammed's company used some local provider so we were put together with other groups, and shared tents in the dessert. The nightsky is unbelievable! The only minus we saw, was that the company whom Active Treks used arranged the dinner super late, almost midnight, so we waited, after arriving with the camels at sunset, untill the dinner, and were so tired we did not make it until the show... But we wrote with such feedback to Mohammed, he promised to rearrange this in the future.We would definitely use his support when we come trekking in the Atlas again."

This time for a desert trek in the area of Oulad Driss (near M\u2019hamid), and visits to Telouet, Ait Ben Haddou and Todra Gorge, en route from Marrakech. Telouet and Ait Ben Haddou are both well worth visiting, although a guide was not available at Telouet. It was pleasant to visit Ait Ben Haddou in the evening, via the stepping stones across the river, when there were not too many people about and no hassle from anyone. The panoramic view from the top makes the climb worth it. On the way to Todra Gorge we followed a piste route from the upper end of Dades Gorge, which was quite adventurous. Information from locals as to whether the route is currently passable (in part it follows an intermittently dried-up river bed) is necessary, together with a 4WD vehicle and a driver who is skilled in piste driving. Some maps don\u2019t distinguish between piste and surfaced roads. We saw a lot of nomads around their camps, and some in caves, and women returning with donkeys loaded with grass they had harvested, and other women climbing rocky slopes to collect vegetation for their animals. This was a great opportunity to see an area that is not easily accessible, and gave a fascinating glimpse of nomadic life. Todra Gorge itself is a spectacular natural feature, but is more touristy than I had expected. The desert trek which took five days, followed a circular route southwards from the small oasis of Oulad Driss, and was guided by Mohamed\u2019s colleague (and cousin), Abdou. We also had a cook, camel driver and two camels. We stayed in a fixed camp at Oulad Driss and for one night in the desert; these camps were basic, but adequate and with showers. Other nights we made our own camp. The food was plentiful and very good, with refreshing salads for lunch. The trekking was for up to 5 hours each day. The terrain underfoot was low dunes and gravelly plateaus, but given the temperature, was quite challenging at times. A camel was available for me to ride, but I preferred to walk. We started walking before 8am, then around noon stopped in the shade of trees for lunch. The temperature reached 38\u00b0C in the early afternoon, and we didn\u2019t start trekking again until after 4pm when it had started to cool down, then we walked until around 6pm. We came across a well most days, but I drank bottled water - I needed 3 litres per day. The scenery was not spectacular, but it was pleasant and I enjoyed the general environment and the experience of travelling in the desert. Altogether it was a highly successful and enjoyable trip, and I was well looked after throughout. The transport was reliable and the food was good. The trek was efficiently and capably organised by Abdou. On a future occasion I would choose a cooler time of year for trekking when it would be possible to walk throughout the day (my trek was over the 2nd and 3rd weeks of April). As I book solo, it costs me more than if I travelled with a group, but it does mean that I get treated on an individual basis which is more to my liking. Walks can be arranged to suit me (I don\u2019t cope well with rugged terrain - I\u2019m getting old!) and more time can be given to things that I am specifically interested in. I will definitely book through Mohamed again.Once again, a big thank-you to Mohamed and to Abdou. CarolM, London"

            "review": "Outstanding experience. My husband and I booked a 4 days trip from F\u00e8s to Marrakech with rough tours. On the first day our driver and guide Driss picked us up at our hostel in F\u00e8s (throughout the trip Driss was always more than punctual). On that day we drove all the way to Merzouga. We stopped on a lot of interesting places on our way and Driss had a lot of knowledge about all of them. We spent the first night in a guest house in Merzouga.In the second day we stayed in the Merzouga area where we saw for examples the gardens of people living in Merzouga, drove across the dunes, had tea in a berber tent, went to Nomads' places and ate a Berber pizza (very good). I would recommend to not only stay one night in the desert, but to stay another night, you'll get to see so much more. Later that day we returned to another hostel from where the camel ride to the desert camp started. Note that rough tours owns its own camp in the desert (operated by local hotel staff) where only rough tours guests stay (we were six people altogether that night). From what I heard from other people this is probably the most comfortable camp in the dunes. We had proper bathroom facilities there and even electric light in the tents. The next day we woke up at 7 a.m. to see the sun rise over the dunes (outstanding experience and a must when you are in Morocco) and had a camel ride back to the hostel where we could use the showers and had a breakfast (we got a small room for ourselves during that night where we could store our stuff that we didn't need in the desert). We drove in direction of our next hotel (a 4*-hotel in the Dad\u00e8s valley). Again, stopped at several spots along the way (such as Todra gorge).On the last day (the way to Marrakech) we went to see the film studios of Ouarzazate (lots of famous movies were shot here) and to the Kasbah of Ait Ben Haddou which is also a set for many popular movies such as 'Gladiator' and series like Game of Throns (the reason my husband and I desperately wanted to go there). In Marrakech Driss dropped us at our hotel.There might be cheaper ways to get to all these destinations than with rough tours, but keep in mind that Rough Tours offers a lot more than simply a car and a driver. Driss, for example, speaks fluent English (he studied English at the university of Meknes) and is very knowledgable about Morocco in general and the desert in area in specific (he himself is originally from that area, we even had the chance to stop at his house and had a tea with his mother ;) ). He made clear from the start that we could ask him any questions and so we did not only learn a lot about Morocco, but also could ask him quite some personal stuff. Therefore, I really had the impression I got a good idea about people's life in Morocco. In addition to that Driss was a very safe driver, the car pretty comfortable and in a good condition and all the accomodations were of a very high standard (higher standard than what we normally book and what we booked when we were in Morocco on our own, maybe this is negotiable if you want to safe some money).To sum it up, I really recommend to book a Rough Tours, you won't regret."

Rachyd is also into photography and he took some memorable pics of us along the way. It was my 30th anniversary and they managed to organize a cake for me in the middle of the desert!

The country, the people, the culture and Rough Tours exceeded my expectations! My friend and I have been travelling together for the last 10years or so, neither of us had the time to plan the trip so we decided to try a tour. We looked at other tour groups, but Rough Tours really stood out to us, for the quick responses to our emails, including everything we wanted to see and more, very detailed itinerary, websites of the lodging and the price of the tour. Youseff, manager, was very quick to answer all of our emails, questions and concerns. We found that they were cheaper than the bigger tour groups, and we liked the idea of the trip being about what we wanted to see and do, rather than a set itinerary that waited on 10-20 or more travelers. It seemed more personal with the 2 of us and our guide/driver. We did a 14 day tour with Driss, our guide/driver. First of all, I am most impressed by how punctual Driss was throughout our trip, always 15 minutes early. (We've travelled a lot, and its very rare to have someone early). Driss, was fantastic, friendly, funny, knowledgeable and an overall great guy. We spent 2 weeks with him, so I feel like I left the tour having a new friend. We spent a lot of time in the car, by the way the car was a Toyota land cruiser, so we were very comfortable and Driss is a very good driver. I felt very safe even through the Tizi n tichka pass, you'll know what I mean when you do a tour with RT. Like I said we did spend a lot of time in the car, but it was one of the most beautiful and scenic drives, my favorite was the drive from Fes to Merzouga, the landscape always changing. During our long drives Driss was great at explaining Moroccan culture, what its like to be a nomad, the difference between Berber and Arabic people and telling us all about the history of different sites and villages. There was a big holiday during our tour and Driss was telling us the importance of Eid Al Adha., the day families get together to celebrate \" The Feast\"! We also listened to each others music, which I really enjoyed. I felt like I learned so much from him and his country. It was a very eye opening experience, Morocco completely exceeded my expectations, and I don't think we would have been able to have such an experience had we done it on our own or on one of the big tour groups. The riads and hotels we stayed at were very nice, my favorite was in Chefchaouen and Xaluca in Merzouga. If you have the time, to spend in Morocco please do more than a 3 day tour. There is so much to see and its all amazing and please do it with Rough Tours. I had Driss as a guide and he was so much fun to be around, but the other guides that I met along the tour were just as friendly and fun to be around, so you can't go wrong.Driss, Youseff, Mohammad and the rest of the guides thank you so much for the amazing experience! I hope to see you all again! Inchalah!!"

They took good care of us while accommodating our eccentric curiosity. Like me, Hassan's a history buff. Pretty much every company follows the same itinerary; for us, the RoughTours difference was Hassan's thoughtful commentary and his readiness to trade ideas in an open-minded way. Though the long drive sometimes grew tiresome, our conversation never flagged. From Fes to Marrakesh, the teamwork between Hassan and driver Ibrahim was flawless. Ibrahim's an expert and careful driver, and low-key funny. I could write lots more, repeating the praises heaped on RoughTours by other guests, but it's enough to observe here that the reviews here show that hundreds of others, almost without exception, have also had a great experience with this company."

I took my family of 5 to Morocco this last summer (2016) and we had a 5 day tour with RT booked based on the recommendation of a friend. Of our entire 5 week trip to Spain, our 5 days in Morocco was everyone's favorite without exception. Our guides, Mohammed and Hassan quickly became like family to us. My kids, (7, 10 and 14) were equally charmed by both men as they took the time to get to know our kids, joke with them and fully include them in every aspect of the trip. My kids still talk about them both. They were patient, extremely knowledgeable and funny. We saw SO much of Morocco in such a short time. Of all the places I have visited in the world, Morocco completely stole my heart. I definitely want to go back and see, learn and do more. Our trip included Tangier, Fez, Chefchaouen, Atlas Mountains, Sahara Desert, Marrakech to name only a few. I could have spent a full additional week, for sure. The food was amazing virtually every place we went, the people were welcoming and kind and the history was rich and inspiring. If you are going to Spain, do yourself a favor and take the trip over to Morocco. Or just go to Morocco alone! It will not disappoint. And if you do, book a trip with no one other than Rough Tours. They don't have the almost perfect rating for nothing. It was an epic adventure that will always be a favorite for our family. And ask for Mohammed and Hassan!! (Between the two of them they speak at least 5 languages so they will almost definitely speak one of yours). TIP: We went in July and it was bloody hot riding camels in the desert. Because it was such an amazing experience we almost didn't notice the heat, for real, but maybe another month would be more comfortable. :)"

We did a roughly 6 day tour back in March/April with Youssef and couldn't be happier with how it all worked out. We managed to do a whirlwind tour of the country and see the majority of the top sights in a very quick timeline (while still leaving a few places to visit for another trip) all in relative comfort (there was a large amount of driving, but that's a given). Everything from accommodations, to food, to guidance throughout was top notch. Extremely highly recommended."

From the initial correspondence via email with Yusef, the tour with Muhammad, and our (complimentary and unexpected) transfer from our Riad to the train station with Ibrahim, it was very clear that this is a company comprised of kind, attentive, knowledgeable professionals. The tour was a whirlwind of stops; natural sights, camel treks, historical sites, markets and cultural experiences--each narrated by Muhammad who was an amazing source of facts and history (and who seemingly knew every person we encountered by name). Each stop was carefully chosen to provide a rich, varied and enriching experience. This is a wonderful company and a wonderful experience."

Our guide Mohammed was an incredible person and fantastic guide. He picked us up at our hotel in Fez, and proceeded to drive us all over the country. We saw places we never would have on our own, and it's great having someone so knowledgeable about the history and culture of each region. Whether it's riding camels and camping in the Sahara, walking around Ait Ben Haddou or exploring the market in Rassini, this company does not disappoint. We would happily travel with them again, and look forward to bringing others with us next time."

I've been on many short tours, in many countries, I spent twelve years living in Arabia and have crossed deserts and mountains. So, I had limited expectations for this not-far-off-the-main-road trip from Marrakesh. I had chosen Rough Tours in part because it supports education for Berber children, in part because Youssef -- Director of the family-owned business had sounded so committed and helpful when I rang the company, also stating that the company makes a point of ensuring that no one is pressured to buy any type of souvenir whilst on the tour. In fact, Youssef made the whole trip a joy from start to finish. As our driver and guide, he made us feel totally safe and looked after at all times. We went to heritage sites, and an eco-lodge, shared information about the fantastic rock formations (my travel companion was a geologist), ate good food, shared great conversatiobn and a lot of good humour. Our night out in a Berber camp, after a short camel-ride, was geared for tourists but good fun and had the luxury of a real bed and clean showers. All in all, we were sorry to get back to the bustle of town and to say goodbye (almost) to Youssef. In fact, we met again as, next day, Youssef kindly came to collect us from our hotel and take us to the airport. I recommend Rough Tours most highly -- and I can't wait to go back for a longer tour myself. We will aim to go \"en famille\" next time -- with the little ones as well -- and spend more time in the \"authentic\" desert!"

Morocco is not the easiest place for solo female traveller, and traveling through Sahara from Fes back to Marrakech seems even more adventurous. I am glad I picked Rough Tour coz from the very beginning, Youssef responded very quickly, and details of the itinerary were laid out clearly. I was not doing much research with the trip, so i don't know what to expect. But when i showed the experienced riad owner, she confirmed that the itinerary is very elaborated and hits all the good spots. I took the trip with Ahmed and Mohammad, and they took care of me very well though out the whole trip. Pick up and drop off on time, constant check up on me see whether i need anything or special request. It was Ramadan during my trip, so they basically had no food and water through out the whole day time. And with the high temperature and dryness in the desert, Ahmed and Mohammad were still being very professional. It was definitely a pleasant trip, and above all, very safe and secured, which is important. Apart from that, 2 days after my trip, Youssef offered the car to send me to the airpot, and Ahmed came to pick me up again. It was a very pleasing service. I just want to tell all the solo female traveller, Morocco might not seem easy to deal with at the beginning, but don't be deceived by the boys on the street (after10 days i agreed with the local people, most of the boys are nothing more than verbal, for a few penny as reward, but nothing harmful at all). Most of the people i met in morocco are very nice and kind, as long as you don't hold up the presumption you have from hearing from internet."

I'd really like to specially mention the driver and tour guide, Ibrahim and Ahmed respectively, who accompanied us throughout the tour. It is not an understatement to say that they were definitely one of the highlights of our trip in Morocco. They are professional, efficient, and friendly. More importantly, I am impressed with their attention to detail - they made us feel at home, gave us breathing space, and always try to address our concerns. With their presence, we were better able to immerse ourselves in the culture and lifestyle of Morocco. It is understandable that you will find it difficult to believe the excellent service evidenced by the many good reviews on here till you actually experience it for yourself. As for the Rough Tours, it adequately provides an itinerary that allows us to have a fantastic insight to Morocco. It is simply an amazing country with such a rich history and tradition that gave me a different perspective to life. The food is delicious and the sights are spectacular. Most importantly, I believe that safety is something that most people will be concerned about. From our perspective, we felt safe and comfortable throughout the whole trip. This company is highly recommended especially when you want to discover many cities in Morocco but do not have time or expertise to plan for such a trip."

My sister and I traveled for three days with our driver and guide, Ishmael from Marrakesh to Fez, stopping at many beautiful sites and cultural hot spots along the way. Despite his Ramadan fasting and the heat, Ishmael was gregarious, knowledgeable and even gave us suggestions on what do during other parts of our trip. We listened to great tunes as we drove through the breathtaking countryside and he came with us during many of the stops. The 4X4 was super comfortable and the AC worked fine. The one night stay in the desert near Mergouza was one of the coolest most memorable experiences of my life. Our camel guide, Saiid, was hilarious and personable making the voyage a lot of fun. Camels aren't super comfortable, folks, so having a good desert guide like Saiid is essential. The food at the desert camp was fresh and delicious. I could probably eat 3 of those chicken tajins at once. The beds were comfortable and clean and I slept like a baby. My sister and I had never been to Morocco before, so this was the ideal way to travel from Marrakesh to Fez. I am absolutely enchanted by this country thanks to our stellar guides. Many thanks, Rough Tours. I will highly recommend you to family and friends."

We joined roughtour in the end based of our friend's recommendation and it was surely one of the best tour experiences, ever, which even propelled me write a review for the first time!We took the 3 days tour going from Fes to Marrakech, and spending one night in the desert under the starry stars. Rachid, was our tour guide, and he was one of the most lively tour guides I've ever met. He was passionate about his culture and we all felt a strong urge from him wanting to explain to us, his country, his people, his origin and his culture. Rachid explained the history and origin of the various site we visited very well and there was never a dull moment on the car. In addition, he felt like a caring friend, as he would time to time, ask us, how he could improve our tour experience and he always came up with a solution one way or another. Last but not least, you would feel you are taken care of on this tour. 3 of us were pretty tired from travelling from Asia and graduation arrangements in the UK, Rachid would occasionally play some music and dance and sing in the car to lighten up the mood on the car, he's definitely the guide you want for a real Morocco experience. In terms of the arrangement of the tour, it was really well planned, eventful enough but did not feel too packed. The guide also told us to inform them to stop if there were sceneries on the way that caught our attention. On this tour, you will travel through the lands of golden sands to the lower canions to the high atlas of Africa; stopping by unesco world heritage site Ait Benhaddou on the way, which was breath taking. Addi, our driver, also deserves special mentioning. Great steady driving with great pacing.Lastly, after the tour, we spent two days in the Medina of Marrakech. Roughtough offered to come pick us up and drop us at the airport. It is always good to know your last car ride to the airport is safe and care free, felt like being driven to the airport by a friend.In summary, the rough was a good blend of culture exploration, heritage site seeing, easy breezy chilling and mingle with good friends experience\u2026 but at the same time feel SAFE and TAKEN CARE OF, which to me, is the most things going on holiday. I would highly recommend this to you, world!"

He picked us up from the Casablanca airport (after patiently waiting as our flight arrived late) and immediately stopped to buy us water and snacks for the road. Having been on tours in many different countries, the guide/driver makes all the difference and the professionalism and friendliness was immediately apparent with the Rough Tours company. The drivers and guides are knowledgable and passionate about their country and dedicated to ensuring we were well taken care of the whole time. I would recommend taking a tour like this over an overcrowded tour bus any time! Youssef would stop whenever we needed to (which happens to be a lot for me) and we never felt rushed. I even showed him a picture of a waterfall that we had not planned on seeing and he went out of his way to take us, which made for a very long day of driving, but was happy to do it. The vehicles are clean and comfortable and the drivers take safety very seriously, there were a couple of roads that might have given me a heart attack had Youssef not been driving!Our accommodations were booked for us at each destination and they were all amazing. We had day tours booked in Fez and Marrakech, both led by knowledgable and energetic women who were genuinely happy to be showing us their cities.

Mountains, valleys, desert, plateau, hills, cities, villages...all just so spectacular. I think we were in the car for about 24 hours over three days, but it was not arduous at all.

I'd had an issue with my SD card and needed to buy a new one, as soon as I mentioned it to Rachyd I was looking for signs of discontent as I wanted to see what the guy was about, there was a genuine desire to help me sort the problem out, this would be a mainstay of the time we would spend together, effortless flexibility - he really couldn't do enough for us, remembered the little things we mentioned previously and made them happen, sometimes surprising us because we'd forgotten! - the sign of a great host and he was.

We stopped whenever we needed to since our 2 boys (7 and 11) are drinking and eating machines. Youssef answered every question we had and more...nothing was taboo. After we crossed the High Atlas mountains with beautiful snow, we dropped back down into the valleys and saw lots of beautiful areas/settlements to include Ait Ben Haddou where they filmed Gladiator, Game of Thrones, and many biblical movies. We stayed in a beautiful hotel and then on to Merzouga and the Sahara Desert. My boys said the camel ride up the dunes to the Berber camp we stayed in was better than any video games, to include Call of Duty; strong praise indeed. After a magical night of Berber food, music, and tents, we rode out and then drove all the way to Fez, stopping along the way to see monkeys in a forest and a Swiss city in Morocco (true!). Overall we loved it! The kids even got to drive in the desert ...another bonus. Youssef and his company take pride in their job and are very excellent. Highly recommend."

After Dris took us from our Riad, we made our route through the Atlas Mountains where we enjoyed the beautiful landscape, took pictures and went on to Ait ben haddou, the famous old city where many popular Cinema Productions have been made.After a night in an excellent Hotel in Boumalene du Dades, we continued in the early morning our ride to the dessert\u00f6, nearby Merzouga, where we took our ride by camels in a camp in the dessert.A beautiful night was guaranteed by a delicious traditional dinner and a beatiful night next to a campfire, accompanied by berber music from the Rough Tour Team.After a quite cold night, we've spent in a tent with bed, we continued our tour to Fes.We liked especially that our guide Dris took us to his Hometown, and showed us his Kasbah where he grew up. It was interesting to see one Kasbah from inside after we saw many of them on our tour. We enjoyed a delicious breakfast from his mother, after we get to know his sympathetic familymembers.The tour took an end in fes, after visiting the ziz valley, ifrane and other beautiful landscapes.We can totally recommend the Tour from Roughtours, also because of our guides who loved their job, which could be seen."

I would highly recommend Rough Tours for anyone wanting to have an experience you will never forget. Our trip started in Casablanca where we were met by Driss who patiently waited two hours for our late arrival and accompanied us to Rabat, the beautiful blue village of Chefchaouen and Fes where we were met by Youssef, our guide for the remainder of our trip. Some of the highlights of our trip include a camel ride and sunset in the desert, off roading to Youssef's home village (Ramlia), a small village of 35 homes and 400 people 5 km from the Algerian border, sharing tea in a nomad's cave, a delicious lunch in Youssef's aunt's home, a barbeque in a small cafe, sharing tea and a berber pizza with two truck drivers on the side of the road, donated by a local woman, the many beautiful riads and hotels we stayed at. Oh yes, and a spontaneous dance on the road outside a cafe with a tour of local moroccan teachers and students on their spring break. Youssef and the many people we met throughout our journey provided us with a glimpse of the generosity and spirit of the Moroccan people. Youssef was more than just our guide. He soon became our friend due to his wonderful and friendly personality. This was also extended to the many people we met along our travels which added to our incredible experience."

If you want you can see Marrakesh in 1 day.As we went mid-april the weather was excellent, we had 30\u00b0 degrees and sunny weather. (in july/august it would be too hot for us)We booked the 4 day trip leaving from marrakesh. The booking process went very smooth and I always received a friendly and quick answer from Youssef. We paid a deposit of 35\u20ac, the rest could be paid in euros during the tour.The first day we were picked up by Mohammed at 8am at our riad in Marrakesh and were introduced to the driver (aghmed). The car was very comfortable.The 4 days were great, we did a lot of adventurous things such as sandboarding, quad riding (optional), camel trek to desert with overnight stay in a berber tent. The nature is awesome. Mohammed (our guide) and Aghmed (our driver) were great, he told us a lot about life in morocco and we had a lot of fun. The overnight stays were also very good: riad dar chamaa (ourzazaete) and Hotel Xaluca Dades (boumalne dades)If you would like to see morocco and would like to experience real adventure, I really would recommend to do this tour via rough tours.regards, Marie & Karin"

My boyfriend and I decided to go with Rough Tours after my parents had a wonderful experience with them a few years ago on a 4 day trip to the desert and a day tour to the Mountains with Mohammed and Youssef. Our tour was a day tour to the Ourikka Valley followed by a beautiful Camel ride and Mint tea served in a real Berber family. The guides are very knowledgeable, professional and helpful in choosing which tour to go for according to what we were looking for. Rough Tours are very organised and always make sure you have the best experience ever. Where to start.. The boys are brilliant and very friendly, both called Mohammed, one of them our guide, spoke Italian but they both speak exceptionally well multiple languages, from French, Spanish to English. The boys where very helpful and dedicated, you can see from how they speak how passionate they are about their land and culture - They just make you love Marocco and its people. They are very professional in their job and satisfy every request and more. They always go the extra mile! The car was super comfy and the driver very cautious.The walk in the mountains to the waterfalls was a blast (sometimes a bit difficult for me, as not use to it as it was very steep) but Mohammed helped me up and down the mountain making sure I always ok. He made us stop at the water falls where he told us various stories and the history and the culture of Moroccans. He never rushed us and also stopped with us at halfway and offered us a Mint tea \u2013 very refreshing! On our way back, after a real Berber lunch sitting near the river and on the floor, I really enjoyed the camel ride in the mountains. Having tea with the Berber family was one of My favourite things. The family was so welcoming and so nice to have allowed us to go into their house and share with us their afternoon tea. Mohammed in depth showed us the house and all their tools to make bread, Henne, butter, yogurt, Argan oil etc.. all hand made at home. Not to forget, Youssef is founder of a very important association called Friends for Nomads and takes part in an association called Pack for a Purpose where people can pack their laguage with things necessary for the Nomads children. I think it is a wonderful and very honourable gesture. Of course when I read it I decided to pack for purpose as well and bring what I could for the children. I would definitely suggest Rough Tours to anyone Who is going to Marrakech or Marocco that wants to live and feel the real Moroccan lifestyle and culture. Rough Tours Thank you again for making our trip so wonderful. I will be back for the desert tour as soon as possible!"

Booking was easy to organise and when I requested the Ourika tour and Ouarzazate, the friendly member of staff suggested we swap our tour days in order to see a weekly market - which was greatly appreciated!Day 1: On day one, our guide Hussain arrived at our hotel on time and was very attentive. He offered us some bottles of water and was incredibly fun! He took us to Ourika valley, where he stopped for some scenic photos along the route. He played some traditional music and told us all about the lifestyle. Both my friend and I are not massive history fans, but the knowledge he shared was really interesting. Hussain took us up to see a gorgeous waterfall which was a fun trek. He was very encouraging and was ensuring our safety at all times - helping us to climb up, watching us cross roads and making sure we went at a steady pace.We stopped for lunch and had traditional food, followed by camel rides and mint tea at a family home. By the end of the day, we felt like we had made a friend!Day 2: Again, we were greeted by our guide on time and this time we were with Rasheed and his driver. The SUV which picked us up was very clean and lots of space. He spoke great english and knew lots of information about Morrocco.He was very fun and made an effort to energise us (we were quite tired after an early start). We were given some traditional Berber names which helped us feel like we fitted in.The journey was a long drive to Ouarzazate, however there were lots of fun stops along the journey to help break it up - including a small trek, argon oil farm and lovely picture spots.The roads through the mountains were very sharp and windy - however, we had an excellent driver who drove with great safety.Rasheed was very fun and pointed out some colourful lizards. He even tried to catch some at one point and was great to see him try really hard to give us the opportunity to see the lizards up close.On our return to Marrakech, Rasheed was very kind and bough us some traditional Morrocan pastries which were yummy!If we return to Marrakech, we would definitely book with Rough Tours again and I would highly suggest the two guides we had!Thank you again,Scott"

I was a little apprehensive about booking this tour from the States, but the 3 day journey through the Atlas Mountains, the desert, and world heritage sites was simply amazing. Youseff (sp?) the owner of the company was very easy to deal with, providing quotes via email and then scheduling the actual date. We were picked up at our Riad in Marakech by the two Husains (sp?), one a driver and the other our guide. We were delivered safely to our riad in Fez after the tour. They even helped us secure tickets at the train station for our trip from Fez a few days before they took us to our riad in Fez. Along the way, we stopped to get pictures and eat at places that provided very good value. The highlight of the trip was the camel ride to our camp in the desert on the 2nd night. We had a group of 3 people (2- 64+ and one 35). Along the way our guides provided a lot of information about the people and places in Morocco, and were obviously very proud of their Berber heritage. No questions were off limits and they were very cheerful and accomodating to our needs. We took the 3 day tour and there was a lot of driving on the 3rd day. If we were to do this again, we would opt for the 4 day tour as our bums were getting pretty numb with all the driving."

            "review": "Unforgettable Experience with Amazing Guide and Driver. First I just want to say that if you are looking for a tour group you need to look no further. Rough Tours were all I could have asked for an more. The guide was an amazing person and unbelievably knowledgable. I learned a lot more than just factorial history of the place. He really showed me what he could of Moroccan culture there and gave me a glimpse into Morocco from all perspectives. I am forever grateful Rachyd. I had two friends who used them a month before I was in Morocco. They recommend them highly so I went with them and wasn't disappointed. The stories from my friends were all positive and were very happy with them. From their praises I didn't even research another tour group. My trip to Morocco was for a week and I used their services for 3 days where I tailored one of their packages a little. They were very understanding and easy to work with when I told them my time and location constraints. They always e-mailed me back very quickly and were always good at communicating everything. I took a tour from Marrakech to Merzouga however I had to go back to Marrakech instead of continuing onto Fez. They told me the pros and cons of that and let me understand the driving times and distances in order to make that work. Very helpful.Personally I wanted a solo trek for my trip to Morocco. This was amazing however this tour was a little expensive because of it as I was the only person on it. They don't do group tours where they put different people together. This is completely understandable because people may want to stop in certain places when others don't. This would make for a very difficult tour. Therefore I could control everything (within reason) on the tour I was on. If I wanted to stay in a place a little longer and not do certain things that was perfectly okay. The guide and driver were very understanding and flexible. My guide Rachyd picked me up from my Riad in Marrakech and off we went. He walked me through the medina to the Toyota Land Cruiser which was our vehicle for the tour. I met the Driver Ibrahim there who was a great guy. Off we went.The tour itself was amazing and well planned out. I won't go through all of the places and everything since you can read that all on their site. However where they stop and what you see is very well thought of and the timing of everything was very good. I never felt I was wasting my time with anything. If I needed anything they would stop and all the meals were on time (as in I wasn't starving and had to wait a long time before we got to wherever we were going).The guide was amazing. Rachyd used to be a Berber himself and traveled between the high and low Atlas Mountains with his family. Since he was berber he really knew so much more about everything because of that. He showed me some pretty amazing places and taught me so much. He was always helpful and treated me more as a equal than just some tourist he was touring. I can go on at length about his knowledge and character but I will share one story that sums it up best. He forgot to buy me a scarf to make the turban for the camel trek (to stay cool/stop sand). This was because I deviated a little from the schedule to take photos of the dunes. Because of this, his solution was to cut his in half for me to have one. He didn't even ask to tell me about it before he did it. He just came up to me told me her forgot to get me one and handed me 1/2 of his. His was 7 meters long he said so I now have 1/2 his scarf. He really put me and my comfort first the whole trip. For him to cut his own scarf in half for me was something I will never forget. It is one of the best souvenirs from anywhere I've been that I will keep and continue to use as a scarf. This was also a good parallel to the Moroccan people as well. All the locals I met were all amazing people. The driver Ibrahim was a great guy too. I spent less time with him however he was still a great guy and added to my experience. He was an amazing driver and I never questioned his driving. He was always courteous with the locals and would be very respectful. He would honk the horn lightly to let cyclists and motorcyclists he was passing them. Speaks a lot when people do that. He also let me plug in my phone to listen to music on the last day when we had a long drive. Nothing but respect for him.The organization of everything was perfect. Nothing was out of sync and the timing was perfect. The places we stayed we all amazing, the \"camping\" in the desert was probably 5 stars as well (great food, comfy, warm, electricity). Really impressed with all of it.The tour was full of Rachyd or Ibrahim going above and beyond my expectations however the end of the tour really showed this. They drove me to the train station and Rachyd took me personally to the ticket office to get my ticket with me. He didn't have to do that nor did I ask him to. I got to Marrakech by the train so I could do this however he did this anyways. Then when I almost got locked out of my Riad after he dropped me off, I e-mailed him and he was prepared to come back to help me out. Luckily I got into my Riad without him having to do this but he was prepare to come help me out even after the tour was over. I will definitely go back to Morocco and if I need a tour I would without a doubt book with Rough Tours again. Even if Rachyd was busy I would try to meet up with him in Morocco when I go back. Great guy and one I won't forget. The whole experience was completely worth the cost. I personally feel a little closer to the culture that Rachyd showed me and I won't forget it. Thank you so much for everything and the experiences I had with you. I can't say enough about Rough Tours and I will not forget my time with them."

In the end, the company had someone drive our luggage from Fes to Marrakech overnight so that we could have it by our 7 am flight the next morning.Overall, Mohammed and Mohcine truly went above and beyond in meeting our requests and sharing information about Morocco with us.

During our 3 days together, Youssef answered endless questions about Moroccan culture, religion and daily life and he regularly surprised us with little delights - things that other tour guides either do not provide or they nickel-and-dime you for. Hakim so expertly and safely drove us through the countryside and mountain passes, and at every stop he quickly jumped out of he car to open our doors - a true gentleman. Here was our itinerary - yours may vary based on what you want to see or do:Day 1- about 8 hours including driving and bathroom/meal/sight stops before arriving in Merzouga. An hour camel ride into the desert for an unforgettable night under the stars. Day 2- desert sunrise, camel ride back to car, then about 6 hours including driving and bathroom/meal/sight stops before arriving in the Dades area for overnight. Day 3- about 8 hours including driving and bathroom/meal/sight stops. The Ait Ben Haddou Kasbah is so cool and well worth the time to walk through it. Overall, there are plenty of stops (with clean restrooms) to take a break - you will feel like a rock star because these guys know everyone and it was fun to see people greet them (and us) like family. The night in the desert was something that I will never forget - a camel ride, the cool powdery sand on my feet, an exquisite 4-course dinner, playing the drums and dancing with the Berbers under a sky filled with vibrant stars, then waking very early (it's worth it!) to experience a sunrise over the dunes. Awesome!Youssef and Hakim gave us Moroccan memories of a lifetime!"

This was our best part of Morocco and we made lifelong memories. Our guide Muhammad and Abraham were FANTASTIC! They were a wealth of knowledge and took really good care of us. The best part was the camel trek into the desert where we celebrated our daughter\u2019s 16th birthday. Muhammad arranged for a cake complete with candles, music and dancing. A Sweet 16 birthday celebration like no other!We all agreed that the best meal was in a small town called Lkheng where we sampled a Berber bar-b-que. Hands down, a delicious meal with the friendliest staff.Overall, the tour exceeded our expectations. Muhammad and Abraham felt like family and after we said good-bye, there was a noticeable absence for the remainder of our trip. I would not hesitate to recommend Rough Tours. The people have BIG HEARTS and seem to love the land and sharing the true Nomad and Berber way of life in Morocco."

Mohammed and Mohammed picked us up at our Riad and off we went. I can say with out a doubt that the four days we spent with them was one of the best time's we've had. From the desert camp in Merzouga to the small berber villages deep in the desert we really felt like we got to know Morocco and Moroccans and weren't just getting the glossy toursist view. By the time we were pulling into Marrakech my wife was holding back tears and we made some promises we intend to keep about coming back with our kids."

I brought my Mum to Marrakech to recover from a serious operation and therefore wanted to make the break as easy as possible. Rough Tours collected from the airport and transferred us around multiple sites and restaurants around Marrakech throughout our stay. Mohammed was very wonderful, friendly and reliable as well very helpful. We also had a private day trip to the Atlas Mountains and Ourika Valley which was outstanding, my mum was overwhelmed, again Ahmed and our driver were fantastic. As well as the service being 5 star the cost of the overall service was very reasonable. I would seriously not use anyone else when travelling to Marrakech or Morocco. Thank you so much!"

We were excited about the Camel ride and spending the night in the Desert, but we would have never expected to have such an amazing experience with our guide Mohammed and our driver Ibrahim. Mohammed is a born-berber, the free people from the desert, and he was every moment prompt to answer our questions about his country, its origins, past and present culture and history. We had a perfect dive into their culture! He was always very informative and just really fun to be around as well. As Brazilians, we appreciated the warmth of their hospitality. On my friend's bday in the desert, Mohammed organized a surprise-cake and small party with traditional music and a not-so-moroccan traditional birthday song (since Berbers do not usually celebrate birthdays). It was memorable, beautiful and that is what differentiates Rough Tours from any other tourism company we have known. They are trustworthy and simple young entrepreneurs from the desert - making a decent living and showing the beauties of the country they love. I could not recommend them enough. Enjoy Morocco!"

The responses from Youssef at Rough Tours were not only very prompt and professional but made us feel that he understood what we were looking for. We went ahead and booked (family of 5, children 16,13,10) and were really impressed when, even after booking, his focus was on making sure we were satisfied with the service he provided (e.g. he arranged to pick us up from the airport the day before our tour started, took us to our riad and organised for someone to guide us to the riad even though this was not part of the tour).The next morning Youssef picked us up in his 4x4 (white Mitsubishi very comfortable) for a 3 day tour: Marrakech to Boumalne Dades to Merzouga to Marrakech. He advised us that it was going to be a long drive back to Marrakech on the third day and he was spot on. The trip itself was amazing, great itinerary, lovely places to stay and good food. Youssef makes sure that the restaurants you eat in are very clean, food preparation is safe and the toilets you stop at are a good standard.So far so good but what made Youssef really stand out for us was when a couple of things didn't go to plan. One of our daughters' was sick (nothing to do with the food). Youssef went out of his way to find an open pharmacy on a Sunday, helped us to work out what medicine was best and offered to drive us to the local hospital in the middle of the night (this was fortunately not required). Also, the road back to Marrakech was blocked by snow and Youssef kept us fully informed, gave options for getting back and always remained calm and in good humour in spite of a possible 5 hour detour.As our younger daughter said, Youssef is not just a tour guide, he's a friend. He was great fun, really knowledgeable and made our trip to Morocco a magical experience. We cannot recommend Youssef and Rough Tours enough, if we could give him 6 out of 5, we would have."

Let's just say that all of the glowing reviews are well-deserved!Our guide/driver was Youssef Boughrara (the company manager/co-founder). Youssef is as a young, educated, entrepreneurial Moroccan-Berber man with a warm reassuring smile and great sense of humor. It felt like we were seeing Morocco through the lens of a close family friend. We felt very safe and relaxed (very low stress) at all times.Youssef has a very good understanding of what travelers who book through Rough Tours (and not through the large group tours) want. He takes you to the tourist sites (after all, that is why you are there) but goes out of his way to avoid the \"tourist traps\".  We did a 3-night/4-day trip that began & ended in Marrakech. Day 1 : Marrakech - Ait Benhaddou - Dades valleyDay 2 : Dades Valley- Merzouga via Todra GorgeDay 3 : Merzouga - Ouarzazate. Day 4 : Ouarzazate - MarrakechSome of the best experiences weren't even part of our official itinerary -- We had tea & bread with a nomadic family in the middle of the dessert and got to see camels that had just been born a few days ago and learn more about their lifestyle.Youssef took us to a couple of the local markets (depends on the day of the week). The biggest was in Rissani -- near Merzouga. We truly felt like we had stepped back to the 1800's. It was so incredible to get full explanations of what was going on in the market around us -- the donkey parking lot, the sheep sales, and more. He also helped us purchase some spices -- easier than trying to deal alone with vendors in Marrakech.If you book with Rough Tours - check out the foundation that they have for their school for the children of Nomads. \"Friends of Nomads\".We wish we could find more companies like Rough Tours in other countries we plan to visit."

We are usually do it yourself type tourists - but a trip to Morocco seemed a bit daunting and we were running out of time so we took the advice of a friend who had recently returned from a tour with Rough Tours and had them book our holiday. Best decision ever. We were nearly 4 hours late arriving to the Fez airport but Mohahammed was there and greeted us warmly. He got us settled into our Riad for the night. We spent the next day in Fez with a tour guide that Rough Tours arranged for us. After a day in Fez we were picked up by Youseff (the nephew Youseff - there are two at Rough Tours!) and taken on a 4 day journey from Fez to Marrakech that left us wanting much more of Morocco and our time with Youseff. He was ever patient with our many questions, our children and many request for bathroom stops. He took us to places a bit off the beaten path and treated us like friends...not clients. We could not have picked a better company and guide for our time in Morocco. From the accommodations they booked for us to the highlights along the way, everything was top notch.

A lot of adjectives, we know, but he exceeded our expectations as we were in great hands every step of the way. He stopped whenever we needed to step out and stretch our legs. One of our children had motion sickness from the windy roads and change in altitude, and Mohammed accommodated us all the way through with his can-do and pleasant demeanor. He not only gave us a wonderful overview of Moroccan culture in general, but also of the Berber culture, of which he is from. Our dromedary (camel) ride into the Erg Chebbi desert for a one-night stay under the starry skies was spectacular. There was also an amazing full moon to admire while the camel guides played drums, sang and encouraged us to play songs from our cultures (our son and another young chap played a few songs on guitar). They are professional, courteous and very trustworthy. We went with Morocco on our minds and have left with Morocco now in our hearts forever! Thank you so much Youssef and Mohammed!

My husband and I had a 4 day tour departing from Fes to Marrakech, with our guide Mohammed and our driver Ibrahim. We asked for a spanish or english tour, and we had both, and even had the chance to practice my italian! Mohammed speaks more than 6 languages, he's very friendly and energetic, and both of them were always happy to show us more of their beautiful culture. It was our first time in Morocco, and Mohammed was happy to answer every of our questions about the culture, territory, architecture, gastronomy... And even new words in arabic and berber. We had SO much fun. The car was a 4x4 air conditioned, and Ibrahim was a very safe driver, even in the desert. Mohammed was constantly sharing with us his knowledge about berber culture, arabic, and about every city we visited or passed by. They both took care of everything for us and were always on time. We learned so much with this tour. We felt completely comfortable and safe with them.We had an amazing camel ride to the bivuac, spent a wonderful night in the desert and came back in the morning by camel. What an amazing and unforgettable experience! Breakfasts and dinners that were included were amazing. Lunches were OK since we always stopped on the road: hence, more touristic places. Our guides always asked if the restaurants were ok, since they were the only part not included, but we didn't took the time to search anywhere else for restaurants and the price was reasonable, so we were Ok with them. You guys made our time in Morocco very special, thanks for everything Moroccan friends :) we will definitely use Roughtours services every single time we go back to Morocco.

All the stops on the trip were breathtaking, not to mention the splendid experience of having a camel (dromedary?) ride on the Merzouga dunes and spend the night in a beautiful camp watching stars and sharing jokes with berbers, truly kind and hospitable people. A special mention goes to the company owner, Youssef. Since the beginning he's been very helpful with the organization of our trip,moreover he provided a driver to take us to Marrakech airport on our final day even if our tour with them was finished three days before! That it is what I call an excellent company that really takes care of their customers. In concusion, we can say that 3 days with Hassan ans Ibrahim have been a gift to us, we enjoed every minute of it! The only problem is that they won't accept the fact that Italian olive oil is better than the Morrocan one ( ;-) ), but what can I say, no one is perfect! We truly recommend Roughtour to everyone, in fact we will definetly contact them again for our next trip to Morocco, which I hope will happen very soon. Thank you again guys!"

Being two city girls...we had been a bit concerned about the lack of facilities for our night in the desert. However, much to our surprise, our tent had an electrical light in it, and there was a permanent concrete structure bathroom with a light, toilet, shower and hot/cold running water. In addition, the men at the camp were extremely accommodating and surprised us with a delicious dinner, hot water bottle to warm our beds, and gloves to keep us warm while we sang and drummed by the fire.The whole night was worth it just to see the AMAZING sky full of stars and moon rise like you have never seen before."

            "review": "Wow experience. My girlfriend and I made a 4d/3n private tour from and to Marrakech. The itinerary was the one which can be seen in all reviews (Atlas, Ait Ben Addou, Dades Valley, Tudra gorge, Merzouga and Erg Chebbi, Dra Valley, Merzouga). We reserved online only on the basis of the enthusiastic reviews on Tripadvisor. We did not really know what to expect from both the trip and the company. To be honest we felt we were taking a little of a bet. However, Youssef, the owner, promptly answered to all our questions and sent us pictures of the tent camp upon our request. His availability and promptness gave us more confidence and relief. Once in Morocco the trip was absolutely perfect. One of the biggest assets was the guide: Adil. A talented 28 yrs old Berber guy very proficient in English and knowledgeable of the territory and Moroccan culture. His enthusiasm and passion were the 5th companion of our trip. He explained to us every bit of Berber culture, showed to us stunning landscapes and sceneries, played drums around the bonnefire in the Berber camp and helped us with all our requests without never being pushy or inappropriate. The trip itself was above any expectation. Top of the list were the desert experience and the moltitude of breathtaking vast landscapes. The accommodations and evening suppers were very nice. Especially the Xaluca terrace was wow. We stopped for lunch mainly in touristic places (we never requested to go elsewhere even if Adil always asked if the places were ok for us), but the food was good and the price fair. Plus in the middle of nowhere we did not really bother to check other places. The driver Ahmid was excellent and careful not to displease us with the drive especially in the curvy roads of the Atlas. Overall the experience was made very unique by the combination of both the awesome sites and the organisation of Rough Tours which left us with the only burden to relax and enjoy the magnifence of this country."

It was amazing until we arrived at the camp in Sahara afetr 1.5H camel ride. The starry night, the camp fire, the drum and singing by our guides...unforgettable! Fes was amzing with medina arranged liek a maze. worth a day's stroll and some shopping. We chose to leave from Tanger port because we went to the \"blue town\" Chefchaouen. The view from out town Mirador was fantastic. Our tour guide and driver are wonderful and without them , we wouldn't understand so much about the culture, history and the language. It was great fun!"

It was amazing - beautiful scenery & towns, delicious food and learned a lot about Morocco. Youssef was the best guide - very knowledgable, upbeat, fun & always professional. He went above and beyond to make it a great experience (even helped us out after the tour had ended). The night camping in the desert in particular was amazing, very comfortable and we had lots of fun with the locals. It is quite a lot of driving each day but regardless I would 100% recommend this to anyone!"

Everything fit perfectly.Our driver Ahmed was beyond good. He was extremely punctual, courteous, informed about all the places we visited and spoke very good English. Infact, he helped us bargain in few shops and got us great deals on our purchases. The sights and places where we stayed were stunning. Everything was like clock work. I am voracious traveler and I can easily say this is one of the BEST tours I have been with. The owner Youssef was very good on email and was always available on phone. We had forgotten to take currency in US dollars and ATM in Morocco wont allow more than 2000 Dirahams per transaction. Just to help us Youssef arranged credit card transaction with one of the hotels - almost at the end of trip. They did all of this in good faith.So, truly cant fault anything with these guys! EXTREMELY GOOD!!"

As I checked different agencies for a 3 night trip from Marrakech to Agadir, where we planned to spent some relaxing days afterwards, I stumpled upon the very good recommandations for Rough Tours. Now I can say they were more than true! Already the answer to my first email to the agency was exeeding my expectations - I got an email with an offer within half an hour! As price and offer were also reasonable to us, we decided to book the offer for an indvidual tour for our party of two from Rough Tours.My husband and me were collected already a few minutes before the agreed time in our Riad in Marrakech from Mohammed, our guide for the next days and Ahmed, our driver. Already on our way out of the city to the Atlas mountain, Mohammed told us a lot of interesting stories. We heard a lot of different things about the Marocain and Berber culture, how people actually live in the country... and we had a lot of fun! Both guys didn't miss a chance to make us feel comfortable and were great hosts!The tour itsself was a long drive by car, but it was defintely worth it: From the Atlas mountains, we drove to the Marocain \"Hollywood\", Aid Benhaddou and the Dades Valley, going on to the Todra Gorge and to the desert the next day. We acutally spent a night at a berber tent in the desert - after we hade a camel ride into the sunset... awesome! The day after we drove trough beautiful landscapes to Quarzazate. On our last day Mohammed and Ahmed drove us to Agadir, still fully engaged in showing us their country.We can only recommend Rough Tours and especially the two guys - they made our trip special by letting us have a lot of fun and adding a lot of additional stuff to our schedule... like sitting on top of the 4x4 while driving in the desert, having a picnic with Berber pizza, showing us where to buy the best dades.....We would again book Rough Tours for a tour in Marocco!"

I communicated with Youseff by email and had everything worked out before we arrived. He was very attentive and accommodating to my requests and answered emails very timely. Our guide was Mohammad and our driver was Ibrahim. I can not say enough wonderful things about these two guys. Just so kind and friendly and knowledgeable. We were a family of 4 with kids 7 and 10 years old. They were amazing with the kids. We saw so much and did so much in those days, and we all loved every bit of it.The places we stayed and places we stopped for lunch were always very clean, which really helps with the kids. Also our driver and guide seemed to know everyone wherever we went, including police. It just made it all very comfortable and safe.I cant emphasis enough how easy they made this whole trip and just how enjoyable it was. Having a friendly knowledgeable guide made our whole trip in Morocco just amazing and worry-free. We did 7 days out of Marrakech to see kasbahs, go to rural villages, water fall, gorges and a camel ride to an overnight in the dessert.Mohammad was just an amazing guide and we didn't want to say goodbye to him at the end. Ibrahim was a very safe driver and I never felt concerned with road safety. Additionally, my husband is somewhat hindered in his ability to walk with a brace on one leg, and they always went out of their way to accommodate him. Also traveling with children, they always played with the kids and were super kind and helpful with them.My son had his 10th birthday while we were on the trip and they had a little birthday celebration for him. Mohammad and Ibrahim seriously went above and beyond to make us happy.I can't imagine any other tour group could be better run, or more affordable. The cost for what we did was truly amazing, especially when I saw prices for trips through another company in a flyer in our riad in Marrakech."

Ahmed (never got a last name) was our driver and guide and he was by far the best tour guide I have ever experienced. He was super patient with us (we were constantly late) and very friendly. He took time to teach us all the intricate details of where we were visiting and about the Moroccan culture. He was very accommodating to our needs whether it be special stops for certain foods, allowing us to blast our music in the van, or frequent bathroom breaks. We started in Marrakech and our guide made sure to stop at all the right places for us to take pictures or learn a bit more about the sites. It was a LONG drive during day 1, but we had awesome food and saw basically all the great sites the tour promised such as Ait Benhaddou Kasbah where they filmed multiple films. It was awesome to see where multiple countries used to meet to trade goods. The hotel was awesome too because they had buffet style dinner and cheap drinks! The highlight for me was the camel ride in the Sahara and watching the stars on the dunes at night. There, our camel men cooked us an awesome Berber dinner and we learned to play traditional drums as a group. We joined with 2 other girls in the same camp and quickly became travel friends.The last day of the trip is mostly a blur because of fatigue from camel riding and waking up so early to watch the sun rise from the dessert, but it was so worth it. Our guide Ahmed met us back at the hotel and we started our way to Fes. The highlight of my Morocco trip was by far our Rough Tours experience and our guide Ahmed. He was awesome and we were all sad we had to go the rest of the vacation without him. Unfortunately, I never got his last name and his name isn't listed on the website under guides, but he is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. Thanks Rough Tours."

We toured Marrakech and Fes on our own and then used Rough Tours for our desert tour. We first met Ismail, our tour guide, when he picked us up from Fes. We soon realized what a gem we had! Ismail was fantastic! He was friendly but not over-bearing. He was talkative and quiet. He was amazingly knowledgeable. He had a selection of music to suit all the travellers. I have no idea how he stores so much information! I traveled with two female friends and at no time did we ever feel uncomfortable. He has a great way of knowing just how to interact with people.As to the tour, it was fantastic! We drove and drove until we reached the desert. But on our way, we stopped for pictures, to stretch a bit and to see the sights. He knew just where to take us but we never felt as though we were in the midst of all the tourists. We rode our camels, on a starry filled night, to the desert. Slept in a tent (luxury tent of course!) and woke to the see the sunset. Rode our camels back and kept on our tour. We saw villages, an olive oil factory, argon oil cooperative, kasbahs, cinema museums, a little hiking and so much more. I was hoping for a particular hotel and Youssef (the owner of the company) was able to arrange it. Our last stop was the Ouzoud waterfall which was gorgeous. It was worth every penny + so much more. Breakfast, dinner and our hotels were included in the cost. I did quite a bit of research and it's a bit scary to pick a company on the internet alone, but I was more than satisfied. Had I of known how challenging Morocco is, we may have used Ismail for other portions of our stay, as well. We did navigate but it is great to have someone who knows so much and knows just where to go. They do day trips, local tours or much longer. Just ask and they seem to be able to accommodate your needs.All in all, I would absolutely recommend Rough Tours and definitely ask for Ismail!"

He picked us up from our Riad right on time and took great care of us. The vehicle was nice and new. We went through the high Atlas Mountains, Dades gorge to camel ride in the Sahara desert. It was an amazing experience and Ali answered all our questions. I would use rough tours and Ali again. They worked out all the requests I had for them perfectly. It was a great experience."

Because we wanted to see the real rural Morocco, they took us to visit their families! We loved every minute and were treated like long lost family members. They arranged the camel camping trip to an oasis, which we will treasure forever. Please if you go to Morocco, use Rough Tours if you want to see the real Morocco. We visited Berber villages and Nomad families. The people were such a highlight. We booked for 3 nights. Look at their website and do yourself a favor and use them for the multi night trips."

Next, continue with our tour pick-up time from our Riyad, we met our personal guide Youssef, he is very friendly, humble person and professional. He lead us to the 4x4 vehicle, very spacey, clean and it is a big vehicle. We are very happy even at this stage.We start our tour from 8.30am until 5ish pm, during the journey we loves every stopping, especially stop the High Atlas Mountain, we choose 40-45 mins for hills trekking by mule (very much unique experience, lovely Berber local guide team and also you must be fully fit to do this activity). End of this activity, then we enjoying the authentic Berber lunch (at roof top) with an amazing views of the high Atlas mountain, and finish our lunch with traditional Moroccan tea making. Absolutely fabulous..There are more unique experiences in these full day tour, our personal guide Yousseff knows how to make us feel comfortable and also make the journey more fun and informative. Also, we did camel ride and he let us stopping in many interesting places whenever we want, to take photos or just curious, and we tried Cactus fruit (very nice). Overall, we had a very amazing time, absolutely brilliant service, and we would like to say thank you again to our personal guide Youssef and also thank you to the Manager Youssef B - for your extra mile and best customer service to us.

Youssuf the driver was fantastic, he explained a lot about the Berber culture and gave a full explanation of everything we asked him along the way. The dramatic Tiz n Tichka pass and then stop off at Ksar Ait Benhaddou before setting off for Zagora. A sunset camel ride was arranged for us into our desert Berber camp, tea and then an evening meal was laid on. In the morning we were woken early at 6am to climb to the top of the sand dunes to watch the sunrise. Followed by breakfast and then camel ride back to our 4x4. There was an option of a film studio trip but we were too tired, but instead eat fresh dates from the palms in the Draa valley and cactus fruit.Stunning scenery and a great adventure, made really special by the Berber team at the desert camp and a special thank you to our guide Youssuf who really made a fantastic effort to be a polite and informative host. If any of you get him on your tour, you are in really good hands. Diolch yn fawr iawn !"

Luckily the day excursion to Ouzoud waterfall with rough tours gave us a very different perspective about Morocco, its land, culture and people. To say that they are the best tour company is an understatement since they did not only did the tour for us but also helped us to print our boarding passes and transfer us to the airport. Mohammed and Youseff were very prompt in replying to our emails. Of course, we could not praise our guide Dress enough as he was very friendly and knowledgeable. The driver Ibrahim even without uttering much words can make us laugh as he was quite fun.The waterfall is the highlight of our trip. On our way to the waterfall we had lively conversation and on the way back we enjoyed the Moroccan music in the car. All in all, we had an amazing time with rough tours. Highly recommended."

Those who had booked a trip through Thomson looked very jealous as they were herded onto a big hot coach! During our journey Mohammed spoke of the land of Marrakech and Morocco- the traditions, beliefs, culture. It was mesmerising and so fascinating I learned so so so much! In fact when we arrived at the Cascades we didn't want to leave the car because the journey had been so enlightening.Now, the cascades... WOW. Never before in life have I witnessed such beauty. Mohammed got us to the waterfalls before the crowds so we had the place to ourselves to explore. We visited the most wonderful monkeys and fed them as they clambered all over us! They are majestic creatures it was like being in a David Attenborough documentary.We swam in the waterfall and Mohammed became our personal photographer - he took some incredible shots that will last a lifetime.Please book with rough tours and request Mohamed!!! You won't regret it!"

This is THE best way to see the country), then spare yourself hours of research and trust me when I say Rough tours is the answer. I had researched multiple tour companies excessively and can confidently say Rough tours stands out. I did the 4 day/3night tour from Fes to Marrakech via the Sahara desert with another solo traveller. Heres the details of my trip:COMMUNICATION: Youssef was very responsive and courteous with communication and replied very fast. I could just tell he was interested in the business compared to other companies. In fact, I had contacted him just the day before departure after 5pm! This was extremely last minute and yet, Youssef still found me a tour with another solo traveller to join! He was talking to me past 11pm to finalize the plans even though it was too late/last minute.PROFESSIONALISM: Youssef was very kind and courteous. My trip was last minute but he did not demand any payment or deposit. Instead, he treated me like a normal paying customer and I took 3 days to pay him! Yet he did not mind at all. Everything promised was delivered. There were no annoying stops at carpet/souvenir shops, as promised on the website)DRIVER: We had the pleasure to drive with Ibrahim. He is a very nice and happy guy and made the trip so much fun! Most importantly, an extremely skilled driver and made us feel safe GUIDE: Our guide was Driss. He was very warm, welcoming, even bought me free breakfast, water etc, paid unanticipated parking or police tickets etc without any hesitation. He even took us to his home in his village on the way to have tea with his family! I really felt at home. Very knowledgeable as well.THE RIDE: This was money well spent! We were in a mitsubishi 4x4, very very comfy and spacious! This actually was the best component of the package for meHOTELS: We stayed in Maison Merzouga, a very quite and calm guesthouse located in Hassa'lbied right at the edge of the golden Sahara sand dunes! It had a great swimming pool even! The owners were extremely kind and fed us very well and treated us like family. Next night was in a small, cozy desert camp. The third night was in the best hotel you can find in the Dades Valley (look it up, its the Xaluca hotel chain) with great panoramic views of the valley. (Note: The WiFi was not working in the rooms though - nothing to do with rough tours management). Dinner and Breakfast were buffet style but felt like we were at a grand luxurious wedding! Very big buffet table!LUNCHES: Driss chose decent places for lunches. Expect to spend 100-120 Moroccan Dirhams for the lunches; this is pretty much the standard across the tourism industry. In Merzouga, we met Moha, Youssef's brother, and he fed us for free! This was very unexpected and very generous of him. He refused to accept payment for this. TOUR CONTENT: What can I say!! Best trip of my life and definitely the highlight. Sahara desert is amazing, the night sky, the camel ride into the sunset, the vast orange dunes, you HAVE to do it once in your life! Do expect to pay tips for some of the activities (e.g. watching the khamlia dance, or having tea with nomads). Tips are very important to sustaining the livelihood of these unfortunate individualsTHE BEST PARTS: 1. I was in a difficult situation since the tour was going to end in Marrakech in the evening and I had a very early flight to catch from a different destination the next morning. My fellow traveller and Driss were kind enough to start early in order to get me to the train leaving marrakech on time. But midway through the day, Youssef was kind enough to make special arrangements for his upcoming tours such that Driss and Ibrahim dropped me at the airport in another city on their way. And for free! They made a special detour for me. I was blown away by this act of kindness and they made my journey a whole lot easier and smoother. This sealed the deal for me and I say honestly I couldnt have chosen better. 2. I got a friends out of the whole thing! If you are a solo traveller, consider joining another solo because a friendship might me awating you! I got along very well with the other solo traveller and throughly enjoyed his company. I'm glad we went from strangers to friends in just 4 days. Also, felt like Driss and Ibrahim had known me for years. SUMMARY: Spare yourself the time and effort and go ahead with Rough Tours. I cannot recommend them highly enough. I was blown away by their kindness, concern and care for their customers, and their amazing delivery of an adventure of a lifetime!"

We went on the waterfall tour that is close to Marrakesh (50min) We were picked up promptly from our hotel by our guide and driver both of whom were friendly, relaxed and made the whole experience exceptional. We chatted all the way there, discussing culture's, history and differences. He was very knowledgeable and able to answer all and every question with very good English. The climb up to the main waterfall was steep but anyone in sturdy shoes and confident on there feet would be fine. The views are beautiful of the waterfalls and the surrounding Valley, so different from the madina and great to see another side of morroco. We stopped off at a local house and was made traditional tea, was great to see how alot of the people live, a unique opportunity. The only disappointing thing was lunch after the waterfalls which was in the village at the bottom. It was very cheap 100/150dh for three courses but the food wasnt very nice and a bit cold. My orange juice was not there lovely jucie I have had else where but watery fake orange medicine flavour. They were happy to change it for a banana milkshake which was nicer. I feel I should say though I do have high standards when it comes to food and have had much nicer in the madina. There was very little available there as well.After saying this I would highly recommend this trip (food is out of their control). It was great fun with great company on a private trip to see more of morroco and some stunning views/waterfalls. If I were to come again I would take there trip into the desert for a few days and get to see more of the rural country"

We were picked up from the hotel at 9 and dropped back at 5. Mustafa was very informative and a real easy going guy who makes you feel like a friend more than a customer. Ali appreciated the fact I pointed out he is named after a bottled water company in Morocco and was a good driver, not crazy like the taxi service in marrakech. We got water on route and headed to the valley where we climbed to a point which was safe being careful with your footing. To go further you need to go up an everyday ladder which is removed and put back when needed, a bit risky and one our tour guide felt was not necessary. I felt this was good judgement as we saw a number of people struggling and you did feel for their safety. We headed back down the mountain to the base of the valley where we had lunch. This was the only disappointment of the day, a 3 course meal for 100 or 150 dirham. The food was very bland and easily the worse meal of the holiday. We have high standards for food and have paid less for better food in morroco. The restaurant was called le noyer as was situated by the river which was the only thing going for it. It was a shame but mustafa assured us this was the best restaurant in the area which at the base of the valley is very touristy. On our return trip we visited a berber family in their home which was lovely. We were warmly greeted and provided with fresh tea and learnt about their way of life. This was very interesting and something most tours would not provide. All in all par the lunch the day or was one of our best days in marrakech. The company has no control over the quality of restaurants available in the area and should not be held against them. Thank you for a fun and entertaining day Ali and Mustafa!"

Its quite a trek up there so be sensible!Hassan was very knowledgable and very chatty throughout the day - i would definitely recommend him as a guide - really made our day very special. Thank you Hassan :-)We stopped for lunch in a place that a few of the tour operators seemed to use but it was a good lunch - very tasty - and 2 options of either 100 or 150DHS.I would have absolutely not hesitation in recommending Rough Tours for any of their trips."

Before our trip, Rough Tours was very responsive to our e-mails and patient with all our questions. When our party of four arrived in Morocco, Youssef heartily greeted us at the airport and made us feel welcome. From that point on, they took care of every little detail with expertise. We learned so much about Berber customs, history, and religion, in addition to meeting so many great people. Rough Tours is a wonderful ambassador for Morocco. Youssef is knowledgeable, kind, and great fun. I have traveled to over 20 countries, but this is my first online review. I just had to HIGHLY recommend Rough Tours to you.Thank you Rough Tours and Youssef for all you do."

He was truly an amazing ambassador for this beautiful and mysterious country. He had answers for all of our questions, knew just where to stop for photo opps and gave us a premium experience. I'm not sure that I have ever met anyone like him - friendly, professional, responsible. We were very sad that we had to part ways with him to continue our adventure. I can't recommend Rough Tours enough, Youssef in particular.Youssef - thank you for making a holiday that I will never forget. Knowing you and your charitable acts make me a better person.Truly, \"life is good.\""

There are many companies out there all offering similar programmes. We selected Rt based on recommendation, how responsive and helpful they were with really quick replies to e-mail and that you don't need to mess around with Western union type transfers as a deposit. 30euro on PayPal, job done. Could not have been any easier. At the planned time, bang on schedule, two warm smiling faces appeared. Ismail our guide and Ibrahim our driver. Very quickly we felt at ease with these guys and got on our way in a new people carrier type vehicle. Although we had expected to see a 4x4, it soon became clear this is definitely the way to go. Plenty of space and room in very comfortable seats for what is a pretty long journey.In no time at all we were chatting away with Ismail, his English is excellent. He is positive and enthusiastic about Morocco and genuinely delighted to show you the country and the area both he and Ibrahim are from as they are both Berber. He will chat about food, history, religion, geology literally all sorts of everything. For him and Ibrahim clearly the more interest you show in things the better the trip is for them as well and they really do open up as much as you would like. It is not a relentless barrage of information either, there is plenty of quiet time to observe the stunning countryside pass by and they have some really cool music as well. The variety in scenery is astonishing, it really is a beautiful country of many scenes and so many colours. Lots of opportunity to stop and take pictures and generally mooch about, plenty of breaks for drinks and food, a guiding voice when making souvenir purchases, all at a relaxed pace. Both guys are really helpful with nothing too much trouble. The accommodation provided was excellent. You would be hard pressed to improve on it. The actual tour out into the Sahara by camel was everything you hope for; simply incredible. This is not a few sand dunes, this is the real deal and every bit as stunning as the pictures. The unexpected surprise was the journey back via the Souks in Rissani. We timed it, by fluke!, when it was the weekly market. Absolutely incredible. The sights, sounds donkey (car) park was fantastic. Though we thought we had had enough of shopping in Marrakech, this was something so different and of course you are safely in the company of two local guys. Just great. We really took our time to choose a tour company to do this with and are so very pleased with our experience with Rough Tours. If you feel slightly uneasy about trusting all the reviews, feel free to pm me if it will help. Oh yes, and if you want to pay 'in quids' they are happy to accept that to, no currency conversion required!!"

My wife and I had a lovely time chatting about all sorts of topics, learning more about Morocco from these guys--that was almost worth the price of the tour itself. About 3 hour drive from Marrakech, the falls were spectacular. Great place to visit, and very refreshing after being in the city a couple days. Beautiful scenery. There were also several tasty restaurants along the walk to the bottom of the falls, and some shops as well if you're interested.One highlight for us were seeing the barbary macaques in a natural setting. They hang out at a look-out spot along the walk, and other places along the walk. These monkeys were gorgeous, and not skittish around people (for better or worse). Although you're not supposed to feed them, we saw some locals feeding them, and you can literally just hang out with these monkeys. It was refreshing to see them living happily in nature, after seeing a couple stuck on leashes in Djemaa el Fna.Overall, this dayt rip was one of our highlights while visiting Marrakech."

Our guide, Achmed, and driver, Mohammed introduced us to their Berber culture. It felt like a road trip in a van with two young Berbers who knew everyone wherever we went. They were fun & friendly and took care of everything for us. They played a soundtrack of wonderful Berber music as we drove through the countryside. We really enjoyed meeting all the welcoming Berber people. The tour was \"rough\" in name only.

Youssef, was courteous and prompt in replying by email, and we have in fact booked several prospective tours with them. Our first trip with Rough Tours (visiting the Ouzoud waterfalls) was pure magic. We had Ismail as our guide, and Hassan as our driver. Although Ismail was quiet in the beginning he really opened up over time. He is a young guide who has heaps of knowledge and history to offer. Rough Tours as a company is really trying to make a difference to make Marrakech a better place by improving the lives of rural berber communities, and children who don't have access to schools. Its a noble cause, and I have uttermost respect for them.The falls in itself were amazing, along with the scenic drive passing little villages along the way in the atlas Mountains. Although there is some walking to do, its not a difficult trek to walk to the falls. We dined in a lovely quaint little restaurant by the falls that had a fantastic view, and had one of the best tagines here. We also saw several Berber macaques along the way. As a word of warning, there are lots of steps to climb up from the bottom of the falls to make your way up to the car park, so wear comfy shoes.We had such an unforgettable and wonderful day with Ismail, it was absolutely faultless. I have no hesitation in recommending Rough Tours, and Ismail as a guide (and Hassan as a driver)."

The day trips were scheduled consecutively to allow us to return to Marrakech each night, making the trips efficient and 'luggage-free'.On each of these days, Youssef arrived on time at our accommodation with an enthusiasm and bright outlook for the day that made us feel excited for the day's adventure. The road trips averaged two to three hours one way but they never seemed long as Youssef shared his seemingly vast knowledge of the countryside, the destination of the day, and Morocco's unique history and culture. We enjoyed his hilarious stories and interactions that the trip became as much a learning experience as a relaxed sightseeing one.Worthy to note that Rough Tours' standard travel philosophy includes the ability to be reasonably flexible on demand: Our changes to schedules were \"no problem\" at all; on a few occasions, requested stops to take in the views, take photos, beverage breaks, and the inevitable bathroom pit stops: - all in good time, no pressure!Throughout these day trips, Youssef provided not only his expertise and knowledge, but a genuine warmth and interest to enhance our travel experience: the superior service was in the details.As we travelled south in the days that followed, we would count on Rough Tours again to expertly guide us through the labyrinth of Morocco's regional cultures and varied topographies.

We then began our journey back to Marrakech stopping along the way for an optional camel ride (price was not included in the trip) but was well worth it, great experience! The day was amazing as were our two guides! I would definitely recommend Rough Tours for an exceptional and memorable day! Good price for having your own personal guide. Would love to do the desert trip next time! Thanks Youssef for a fantastic day!"

Additionally, he was super flexible when we had issues with travel and changed our travel dates without any issues. However, the best part was the 4 days of seeing Morocco through Dris and Mohammed's eyes. They were both extremely fun, informative and hospitable. I would recommend Ramlia as a visit to anyone doing Morocco. It was one of the highlights of my trip.. so thank you Youssef, Mohammed and Dris :)"

Ismail, our guide from Roughtours, was restless and together with Hassan, our driver, did everything to make our trip unforgettable. Roughtours helped us defining the route and attractions. They booked hotels and supplied the transportation. The van was new and functional and had the right size for our group and bags. The driver was secure and drive safe the entire trip. In some cities, during planing, we changed the proposed hotels for Riads of our choice looking for an even better experience. But all the hotels booked by Roughtours were nice, clean and well located. For the night on the desert we upgraded the camp (both proposed by Roughtours because we were afraid of the cold) and the experience was great!Roughtours price was fair and what was promised was exactly what we got."

He is clearly very well educated, and I certainly hope that if we ever take another trip with this company, he and Ibrahim will be our tour guides.Nothing was pushed on us- at no point did we feel as if we had to buy anything, or that we were stopping simply to tick a box.

            "review": "Ouzoud Waterfall Day Trip From Marrakech. My wife and I are visiting Morocco from Canada and took the day trip to Ouzoud Waterfall with RoughTours yesterday (November 19).We were picked up directly from the riad we have been staying at by Ismael, a well-spoken and informative guide (albeit quiet at first). Our driver was a mild-mannered and often jovial Ibrahim. Ibrahim himself didn't speak much English, but he was very courteous and friendly.Our trip to the falls took about two and a half hours from the heart of the medina in Marrakech. Along the way, Ismael opened up a bit once he got a feel for our temperaments. He is very well educated as you will most probably find out for yourself. He is quite knowledgable about the various nuances of Moroccan life, especially that of Berber culture as he himself is Berber.On the road to the falls, you can expect to see an ever-changing landscape. From arid desert to fertile plains, then eventually to the verdant mountains which ultimately act as the home of the waterfall itself. Fortunately, Ismael is well-versed in the history and current inner-workings of each of the places on route. We had a quick stop at a cafe about halfway which afforded bathrooms and something to drink and nibble on for those so inclined.On arrival to the waterfall itself, you'll have the opportunity to take photos from the top and will have your choice of route down the the bottom. Either direction seemed to offer a number of opportunities for some nice photos, although undoubtedly you'll opt to take more from the bottom.On the trail down (we took the dirt path route, not the paved), Ismael described the historical sigificance of the caves dotting the inner walls of the valley surrounding the waterfall, particularily with regards to how the locals would climb precariously to use them for storage of their valuables (to me, seemingly similar to how sea birds use cliffside caves for their eggs).At the bottom, you'll find more rustic versions of the Maid of the Mist (like Niagara Falls), where they'll offer to row you out a little closer for a \"better\" photo op; however you're probably better off skipping it altogether if your sole intent is to get photos. I found that even at a decent distance away at the bottom, the spray was enough to cause a bit of havoc on the lens - only exascerbated by the midday sun peeking over the top (although it was stunning to look at).Once we had our photos from the bottom, Ismael asked us if we wanted to stop for lunch, which we were good with. We had chicken tagine and skewers with water - came out at about 150 dirhams with a tip. Ismael left us during lunch to take in the view before rejoining us when we were ready to proceed back up.By the time we were headed back, my wife and I were both pretty groggy and were able to sleep for a good portion of the road back to the city, save for a couple of nasty bumps that woke us from our respective slumbers.All in all, Ismael was very accomodating and friendly, and in our opinion, you'd do well to be paired with him. For what you get, the tour is reasonably priced and we would recommend this tour to anyone thinking about getting away from the chaos of the city for a day and taking in a beautiful natural atmosphere."

If all you want is to see the big cities, any guide and tour company will do... But, if you want to see the real country of Morocco and know the people, most of whom are of Berber origin, Rough Tours is the company for you! With Youssef and his associates, we were able to share time in rural homes and nomadic tents. We discovered there are two Moroccos...the rude, money grubbing cities where locals seem only interested in tourist dollars, and the countryside, where people are genuine and warm and where hospitality exists. We feel we saw the real Morocco because of the efforts of Youssef. We met him through Trip Advisor as a five star, high rated tour guide and feel that we left him as a warm personal friend. Even though the name of the company is Rough Tours, our adventure was comfortable and pleasant at all times."

As a family we have travelled extensively and the quality of the service we experienced I don't think we\u2019ve seen before.We chose a full day private trip to Ourzazate from Marrakech and were met by Youssef the MD of Rough Tours at our hotel. The journey through the High Atlas Mountains was stunning with plenty of short stops en route for photography and refreshments. Youssef shared his passion for his country and knowledge in a very engaging way. Travelling with two kids aged 9 and 6 we were anxious as to how they would cope but needn't have worried \u2013 Youssef involved them in the conversation from the outset. Our first stop was Ait Ben Haddou which we approached via a desert track \u2013 the kids loved the off road driving. This is a spectacular reconstructed Kasbah and in itself worth the long drive to reach it ( around 3 hours from Marrakech). After an hour here we drove on to Ourzazate and finally to Fint Oasis. This was the highlight for kids \u2013 off road driving through a river ! It was a very long day \u2013 12 hours, of which probably 8 were driving, but brilliant. Youssef is the kind of guide who makes you want to come back to Morocco to use his services again. I couldn't recommend him and the services of Rough Tours more highly. He even arranged for a driver to pick us up a couple of days after our trip and drop us at the airport.Outstanding in every respect."

Throughout Morocco this is quite usual, very friendly, very kind. Essaouira is a small city in the Atlantic Coast. As a couple with a private tour we felt at ease during our day trip.

As it was my friend\u2019s first visit to Morocco, I was eager to show a bit more of my favorite destination. As time was a constraint, I called on Rough Tours again to provide us with a day tour out of Marrakech to Ouarzazete as my friend was a film buff. Youssef, manager of RoughTours, very quickly arranged for a car and a very pleasant guide Moha, to take us on what turned out to be a long but comprehensive discovery day of that region. Ouarzazete is a modern and tourist-friendly town. It has wide boulevards and plenty of hotels and restaurants. The highlights of this day trip were a quick tour around the Atlas Film Studio where hundreds of films were developed and an off road drive to a UNESCO World Heritage Site \u2013 the picturesque old Kasbah of Ait Benhaddou - also a popular film location (The Gladiator). As a bonus, Moha, took us to the Taourirt Kasbah just outside of Ouarzazete. A well preserved (recently restored) historic building containing rich traditional interiors. A Berber village was close by to this Kasbah. My friend was amazed that in one day, we had seen, explored and learned so much of the Moroccan history, culture and traditions \u2013 thanks to Moha\u2019s inexhaustible knowledge and patience.More impressive was how well organized and efficient the day trip was as executed by this dependable and professional tour company. I wanted to impress my friend with the beauty of Morocco \u2013 I accomplished this but could not have done it without Rough Tours.

The owner of the company Youssef was really helpful & prompt in emailing back and setting up the excursion for my boyfriend & myself. On the day of the excursion our guide, also a Youssef picked us up from our hotel with no problems. The trip was marvellous, Youssef was really knowledgeable, friendly & chatty. The Atlas Mountains are beautiful and there were plenty of stops in order to take photos. We stopped in one of the Berber villages to have a wander & to take refreshments with a local family. This was so interesting to see the culture & the fact that this family had basically nothing and were offering us things was overwhelming. There was the cutest 6yr old girl present and I wish we had brought something to give her like a colouring book or something. The hike included in this was the Ourika valley waterfall, which is quite steep trek, including some rock climbing & stream hopping. It was so breathtakingly beautiful. Unfortunately I had to chicken out going to the top as I am scared of heights but my boyfriend continued up with Youssef & he enjoyed it! Overall the tour & the company are fab and I would definitely use them again if I came back to Marrakech."

From the outset our tour guide Ishmael and driver Ahmed were very welcoming & super informative about the sights and Moroccan culture in general. It was great to be on a private tour which allowed us to take things at our own pace, especially when going back up the hundreds of steps by the waterfalls! The choice of restaurant for lunch was great value for money (\u00a328 for 4 of us to have a 3 course meal!) & amazing food with an even better view.As a group of girls we felt completely safe going on a private tour and our guides even came to our rescue with an emergency shoe repair half way through the trip!Would recommend rough tours without hesitation!"

            "review": "Learned so much while having a wonderful time.. I also researched many companies. Rough Tours was neither the least nor the most expensive but I chose them because Youssef was so responsive and helpful from beginning to end, because they do not take their customers to places just to get commissions, as many tour companies do, and because they give a donation for each tour to schools for Amazir, or Berber, children. Yes, the trip to the dessert was unforgettable and it's delightful to have all of the details of the trip managed by people who know the country so well. You get to just relax and enjoy the ride. But the part I didn't anticipate, and perhaps it was the best part, is that you learn so much about the history and the culture behind what you're seeing, more than you will ever learn from the guide books and internet. Our driver Ibrahim and guide Ismail became our friends. They answered OUR questions and were so knowledgable about everything from ancient history to current events, biology to geology, music to food, everything. They tailored the trip to our interests. Right from the start, Ismail said it was our trip and if we wanted to stop or change the itinerary, just let him know. When my son had to delay our start one day to respond to a work situation, it was no problem. When we got caught behind a traffic accident on the last day, rather than skimp on our tour, we just arrived later, making their work day end at 8:30 instead of 6:30. I was sad to say goodbye at the end of the tour. It was a wonderful, fun trip with two kind, thoughtful, generous, knowledgable young men, who generously taught us a great deal about their culture and their country. And what a country!"

Some of the drives were long (roads are great though) and our driver Youssef was the best. Morocco is a heavenly country to visit with such a diversity of landscape, colors, food, traditions. Rough Tours lives up to other travels I've made, using other tour companies, taking me to Africa, India, South America, and Southeast Asia. The \"other\" Youssef was particularly helpful in working with us, via online and SKYPE, to plan and choose."

On this recent visit, Rough Tours proved once again that their team of guides and drivers are professional, expert travel providers who are fully engaged with delivering a high caliber of service that is consistently responsive, heartfelt and fun.

From the initial planning of my itinerary that involved many revisions to include places I have not visited before, to the choices of accommodations, and spontaneous wonderful moments and photo ops along the way, my Rough Tours guide and driver took care of details and inevitable complications of solo travel in unfamiliar territory. As a result, my journey became a collection of fascinating experiences, amazing memories and thousands of photos!\u201cOne\u201d is never travelling alone when a Rough Tours guide is on the driver\u2019s seat."

Youssef was awesome from the first email; responding almost instantly to all of my multitude of questions. After booking the tour, I realized that they also did airport transfers. As a couple of single females we were slightly concerned about finding a safe, hassle free ride to our hotel, Rough Tours provided the answer with a VERY reasonable price. They not only were waiting in the arrivals area with our name on a sign, but they even stuck around to ensure that we were safely checked-in to our hotel.The Ouzoud Excursion was perfect. It's a bit of a drive into the mountains but Ishmial (not sure on the spelling) and Youssef had a clean, comfortable vehicle for us, stopped when ever we needed and kept us entertained/informed without being annoying. The Falls were beautiful and there was a great taste of the local culture to be had. Watch out for the boats if you decide to go swimming ;)I would give Rough Tours six stars if I could."

I can't recommend Rough Tours highly enough - the four of us booked a day trip to the Atlas Mountains stopping off at Atlas studios, Ouarzazate and Ait Ben Haddou and from the first communication Youssef was brilliant - the day was fantastic: it's a long trip; 11 hours in total but well worth it for the stunning scenery you pass through to get to the sites. Youssef picked us up from our villa early and spent time telling us many interesting things about our trip and the places we visited; he also arranged guides at the studios (a surreal experience but great fun) and Ouarzazate (a hilarious Berber guide showed us around the ancient palace of the Pasha) and then guided us himself at Ait Ben Haddou, a remarkable 11th century Berber town - if you're a fan of Game of Thrones you might recognise it....Then it was back home through more stunning landscape and a hair-raising but hugely fun spot of off-roading courtesy of Youssef. His kindness and helpfulness knows no bounds - once he found out we were heading home to the UK the following day he immediately insisted he would pick us up and take us to the airport and refused to take any payment - what a delightful man!Do yourselves a favour: book a trip with Rough Tours - and make sure you ask for Youssef to be your guide!"

I had an unhealthy amount of anxiety while planning this trip because there are so many tour companies to choose from and at such a variety of prices.Mostly I was stressed because i knew being a solo female traveler going deep into the desert could be risky if not on the right hands.I must have contacted 9 tour companies and here is why Thankfully I chose Roughtours.:1. Communication was instant and frequent with Youssef, the manager.2. He and his family built a school for children and their families called Friends if the Nomads and part of my fee will go directly to this cause.3. While most wanted money wired and other funky things, Youssef allowed Paypal for payment(a small and fair fee tacked on) enabling me to use Amex.4. He meant what he said and he doesn't take you anywhere that gives him a commission if you buy a souvenir.5. He was very responsive to accommodating my agenda and not his and while he offered advise, he respected it was my trip.6. Clean, air-conditioned 4 by 4 and other vehicles if needed.7. And here is what sealed the deal for me, i can't live without Wifi access and it was important to me to know I could update family to let them know I was okay. Roughtours knows every spot on the road and beyond that offers wifi! They will even charge your phone en route!I was relieved the minute I met Youssef at my riad to pick me up for the tour. He knew I was nervous so he was kind enough to tell me that he would personally be my guide into the desert. He drove all the way from Casablanca to get me.He was friendly, knowledgeable and full of fun. I felt secure and taken care of at all times. Phew!The ride into the desert was magical, spectacular, extremely well run and well planned and Roughtours chose the kindest people to take us in the camels and into the desert and have a glimpse into the Berber culture.It takes a village for a trip to go smoothly and Rough tours planned seamlessly and has a great rapport with villagers in the different stops. It felt like family even to me!I am quite taken by Morocco and all its culture beauty intensity and rush to all five senses whether in the hectic stalls of Marrakesh or seeing the sunset in the middle of the quietest mist serene sunrise I have ever experienced.For sure Morocco is different than most places I have travels in the world as a solo traveler in that I was very dependent upon the guides I hired for various day trips and such. This trip was made by a combination of a great attitude on my part to open myself up to the world but I couldn't have done any if that without the genuine good-hearted Roughtours. I am forever changed and grateful that I had this experience.It could have gone a whole other wrong way, had I not been in such good hands."

We headed out to the desert near the Algerian border where we mounted camels and headed 2 hours into the dunes. The night we were in the desert, there was a meteor shower making the vast, clear skies all the more amazing and magical. YOU MUST DO THIS!!!Every step of the tour is tailored, safe and thoughtful. Following our visit, the team followed up with us to see if we had any feedback and make sure that we got home safely.

I sent many emails to Youssef to get the final itinerary and dates that suited us best (54 wasn't it Youssef) and he always responded promptly with his own helpful suggestions. Our tour included, Marrakech, Ourzazate, Dades Valley, Ramlia (a trip deep into the desert to a local village and not to be missed), Erg Chebbie (great experience of afternoon camel safari into the desert and overnight in berber tents), Fes and Chefchouen. The only thing we would do differently if we had our time over would be to spend at least an extra day in Fes and Chefchouen as they were our favourite city and town.Our guide Hassan and our drivers (Mohammed, Salim, & another Youssef) were fantastic and very helpful. Hassan's english was great and his insights into the country and the places we visited was so helpful. He had a great sense of humour and very, very accommodating of our many request for photos or other demands we may have placed on him. Am I getting my messge across here - they were awesome in every way and my wife and I and our two friends will never forget our first trip to Morocco thanks to Rough Tours. Looking forward to returning.Also the accommodation organised by Rough Tours along the way far exceeded our expectations, beautiful authentic Riads with friendly, helpful staff & great breakfasts and dinners where they were included.As well as everything else another great advantage was the exclusive tour for the 4 of us and that we could have a flexible start date and itinerary If you want to see more detail of our our trip with Rough Tours you can check it out at our travel blog - fabtraveller.com"

Rough Tours did a superb job of organising our tour without any hitches. no mean feat considering the extent of our tour , from all the major cities to the Sahara , Chefchaouen , ourzazate etc.Ismail our guide was knowledgeable , kind , friendly but most importantly a passionate Moroccan who reveled in introducing us to Morocco.We have traveled extensively in Asia and the Middle East , but never have we come across a tour group as professional and welcoming as Rough Tours.Before booking whilst reading all the comments on this website I thought Rough Tours sounds too good to be true, in fact they were way better.Do yourself a favour if you ever visit Morocco book with Rough Tours!"

We decided to visit Morocco just within a week time, in high season, but they managed to arrange everything for us, from a trekking on the Atlas to a night in the dessert of Merzuga. Our guide, Ahmed was friendly and very kind all the time, and the driver, Marwan was all the time very profesional and drove us safetly all the time; we also had an amazing guide in Imlil for the trekking. Restaurants and riads were also good. We usually like to organize and travel on our own, but with Rough Tours we got the best of an organized trip with the feeling of traveling with friends. Also, we really appreciate their ecological approach to travelling, other companies have a different approach and we really realised of it when we were sleeping in a Jaima, in the dessert, with no electricity, and a noisy 4x4 camp was built not very far away"

            "review": "Amazing guided tour of Morocco. We (family of 3, with a teenage daughter) decided to go to Morocco and I wanted to find a tour company for at least a portion of the trip. We normally don't use tour companies and just travel on our own -- but Morocco seemed a little more challenging than Europe or other parts of Asia we've visited. I didn't see any published tours that had exactly what I wanted, but after reading a review on TripAdvisor about Rough Tour's flexibility, I contacted them with what I was looking for. Youssef Boughrara was able to suggest a 10 day itinerary that met all of our needs: Casablanca, Fes, Meknes, Volubilis, camel ride into the desert, Dades, Ouarzazate, and Marrakech. We also included a night in the tiny desert village of Ramlia -- so far off the beaten path for your typical American tourists -- and a real treat.Youssef and I emailed back and forth a few times, finalizing dates, pick-up times and intinerary. His responses were always prompt. The deposit was very minimal -- which seemed strange. But all was delivered as promised.Our driver - another Youssef -- and our guide Hassan were delightful. Hassan's English was excellent and he provided interesting commentary and insight into where we were going and what we saw. Rough Tours provided local official guides in several of the places we visited -- and they were wonderful. Especially Farida (spelling?) in Fes.Rough Tours arranged all of our lodging -- generally in charming riads, well located within the cities we visisted. We really enjoyed the riads: the lovely decor, personable owners and staff, the delicious breakfasts provided, the occasional meals we chose to eat at the riads, and chatting with other guests.I approached this trip very differently than most of our family trips -- allowing Rough Tours to guide the way and we were very pleased. Normally we are rather uptight about time schedules and I am a stickler for managing all details! On this trip, I tried to just \"go with the flow\". That worked well and there were only a couple times where I had wished I had asked a few more questions ahead of time. (Example -- we were on our own visiting Meknes, but I didn't realize this until we arrived in the city and had I grabbed the wrong guide book. We still enjoyed our stroll through the city and the mausoleum of Moulay Ismail, but I felt that I should have realized we wouldn't have a guide here. If I had asked more questions, I could have been more prepared.) But the vast majority of the trip \"flowed\" without incident.A word on distances -- there was a lot of car time on this trip: Fes to Merzouga, Merzouga to Ramlia (4x4 off-road - Bumpy!!), Ramlia to Dades, Dades to Marrakech. The scenery was lovely and ever changing, but that did make for a few long days. The maps make the distances look shorter -- but the roads through the mountains and deserts are not super highways! However, we saw the wide variety of cities and had the great experiences we wanted. And our driver and guide were wise to have us stop frequently to see a beautiful view and stretch our legs or enjoy a leisurely lunch.I highly recommend Rough Tours for a vacation in Morocco!"

My wife and I had an amazing time in Morocco thanks to Youssef, Said and Zaid!Youssef was meticulous and friendly during our initial conversation over email and was with us on the first part of the trip from Marrakech to Ait Ben Haddou, before Said (Adi) our guide and Zaid our driver took over and took us across the dessert and on to Fes and Chefchaouen, and then dropping us off at Tangier for our flight.Youssef was..well crazy (in a good way)! His sense of humour means the laughter never ceased during our time with him. And Said and Zaid were also wildly funny and were very knowledgeable. They are all proud Berber people and we understood a lot about their culture and Morocco in general. Their English are excellent and they were very welcoming to our questions and every request all through the trip. Actually it actually felt like we were travelling with a few knowledgeable friends rather than a guide/driver. Youssef, Zaid and Said, we miss you all and we will definitely recommend our friends from Hong Kong to go with Roughtours when they visit Morocco! We hope we'll be back one day too! Insha'Allah!"

This is a man who always had a kind word and a gracious manner for anyone with whom he was speaking. He was able to delight and humor the teenage contingent and at the same time effortlessly teach us about Moroccan and Islamic culture and history. It was like traveling with a friend: there was no pressure, plans were flexible and laughter abundant."

The harbour was wonderful and we felt we were transported back in time. After a very good \"fish lunch\" the four of us headed back. I could go on in great detail, but suffice to say that this trip is well worth doing. A completely different Morocco.The second trip was to the Ourika Valley. On the way we encountered a tree full of goats (!) and stopped off at a Berber family's house. Very very interesting and touching how they look after each other. Finished off with tea, freshly baked bread, butter and honey and pleasant conversation. Only to be toped by our guide Hasnouni who seemed to have all the answers. Onwards to the Atlas mountains and a little walk to higher regions. Unfortunately the rains had not materialized this year, so it was not as green as usual, but still impressive. I'll keep the next chapter short: I slipped, broke my ankle, Hasnoini piggy backed(!!) me down in very difficult conditions, Youssef, the driver, did a \"Michael Schuhmacher\" and took us to hospital. They stayed with us, translated when necessary, got me even a prescription and even came back later that evening to see if everything was ok. Wow! Without them it would have been a nightmare. So as you can see, I was more than very well looked after. They treat you as an individual and not just a number. One regret is that I didn't do the a longer tour, but there is always next time!So if you want interesting, exciting, different and fun then go with them!"

We went to spectacular Kasbah's, and took an amazing camel ride with a spectacular sunset, not to mention the sand-boarding, star gazing(best ever), tajine dinner in a Berber tent(delicious), traditional singing around the camp fire(even I took up the dums), and teaching each other new games in the Sahara desert.

At first, we were a little skeptical because all of the reviews of this tour company on TripAdvisor were almost too good to be true. However, the trip that this tour company organized for us was really just that perfect and so much more. We had Hassan as our guide and Youssef as our driver. Both were extremely professional and Hassan was very knowledgeable about Moroccan culture and history. We loved every single city we visited, including Marrakech and Fes. Hassan even took us to his village and we got to visit his family and experience true Moroccan hospitality.The definite highlight of the trip was overnight camp in the desert so make sure to include that as part of your itinerary. We rode camels into the camp and were able to watch the beautiful sunrise and sunset from the dunes - just WOW! Youssef, the owner of the company, perfectly arranged the entire trip for us. He was flexible in arranging the tour based on all the cities we wanted to visit and booked us really beautiful riads. As 3 female travelers, we always felt safe and comfortable. The greatest thing about this tour company is that they donate a certain percentage of the profits to Friends of Nomads, a charity that tries to help promote literacy for Berber children.I would not change a single thing about this trip - again it was just simply PERFECT!"

From the beginning I had great confidence as Youssef was extremely responsive (even with the time differences) and very accommodating and kind. We weren't disappointed on the morning of our trip when Hassan and (a different) Youssef the driver showed up. Hassan is an energetic and incredibly sweet person who truly seems to love his job. And with a degree in Literature, we had conversations I didn't expect to be having with our Moroccan guide--who knew we'd be talking about Ibsen's A Doll's House??? Both Hassan and Youssef were very relaxed and accommodating to whatever we wanted. I should note that this is less a \"tour\" than a \"drive\"--once in Essaouira you are just dropped off with an agreement to meet later, and then you explore on your own. This was perfectly fine for us but I note it only because some people might want more of a guided tour around town. In any case, I certainly recommend everything about Rough Tours, and ask for Hassan by name--you will be so happy to meet him!"

All of these exceeded our expectation and it is very good to have a funny guide who is also a photography enthusiast - most of the time we stopped impromptu just for amazing pictures!The most impressing thing is - Youssef never persuaded or brought us to buy anythings in any specified souvenir shops. Instead he advised us where to get the product(s) with the best price possible. They really treated their clients as friends, and that's how they stand out from the rest!Good job Rough Tours and Youssef!"

We have just returned from an excursion with roughtours, and we had simply a fantastic and memorable time!Note that when booking our holiday, roughtours made it possible to customise the things we did. All this was done via email.Accommodation was on the whole, very good. We stayed in several very nice riads, a nice guesthouse, a Berber camp, and a fancy hotel in the Dades Valley.Airport pick up and drop off was seamless. A guide was waiting in the arrivals point of the airport with our name on a card. They then took us to our riad, and we found chatting with them calmed any of our anticipatory nerves.There were numerous photo opportunities (they know where the pretty places are!) and were very accommodating if we specifically wanted to take some pictures in a particular place. Our guide, Said, and driver, Adi, became more like friends and so it was a pleasure to travel with them. They were able to answer all of our many questions about Morocco, covering culture/history/religion/nature/politics and more. (The only question Said couldn't answer was \"why does a donkey ee-ooor, and a horse neeeh?\"... but then again, that was a bad question.)Our particular Morocco travel points to note are:-- full payment for the holiday takes place once there (I guess this might change in the future), hence we were slightly apprehensive whether everything would work out okay when we arrived. As you might guess from this review, it all went very well indeed, and there was nothing to worry about.-- be confident in Marrakech. Market sellers will approach you, but try not to make too much eye contact and a firm \"No thank you\" while keeping on walking away, will see they move on.-- haggle for most things being bought. Try to start just under half their asking price, and negotiate from there. Also remember you don't have to buy anything! Keep things friendly (haggling is fun) and all is fine.-- the trip we did involved quite a lot of travelling in a 4x4 car. If you get severely motion sick, this could be a problem. I suffer slightly from motion sickness, but was fine. Also, just ask to slow down when in the moutains if you think you're going to throw-up.We feel a very important point to note is that our holiday was effortless on our part. Roughtours made the difficult things possible (e.g., travelling, arranging accommodation, walking with bags to various places, finding a place for lunch, etc.) yet left us feeling like we were still in control: we simply concentrated on having a great time! Of course, we could have organised this holiday ourselves, and considered it, but knowledge about a country with a very different culture to ours was something we couldn't gain via the internet only -- we're certain roughtours made fun what would have been difficult for us. Ultimately, our holiday was a pleasure!In summary -- excellent: we very highly recommend roughtours!"

Said and Addi were not only very professional at their job but they were are also friendly, hospitable and loved to joke around. Right from the start of our road trip (tour) we felt like we were travelling with friends, as well as the end as they tried to give us a lift to the airport so we could have a last minute catch up (sadly we couldn't meet). We did the 5 day tour from the Atlas Mountains, Ramlia, Erg Chebbi sand dunes, Merzouga and Ouarzazette, but in between that there are a lot of extras like driving in the middle of nowhere in the desert with only the mountains to guide them, there's no GPS there! We also shared tea at Addi's father's house, visited Said's brothers house, stopped to share some tea with a Berber nomad out collecting fossils, as well as having a picnic in the desert and of course followed by more tea. Said and Addi are both proud Berbers and it shows they care deeply for their community and know just about everyone, as well as give them lifts to their village and in exchange eat some of their home grown dates.Rough tours is more than a tour company, they put back a lot to their community and that shows when we stayed at their guest house in Ramlia. The accommodation they provide was good value, it ranges from the luxury of the hotel in Dades, to the 'Rough' accommodation in the desert camp. What a few people haven't mentioned is the food, all the restaurants they took us to the food was delicious they range from a Berber pizza (my favourite) to a prune and almonds chicken tagine... The home cooked tagine in Ramlia was the best one we had in Morocco..and we had a few! We will miss our Berber friends, but we have fond memories of our tour and we got to see the diversity of Morocco, it's such a beautiful country and our friends there made the experience even better!"

We are from the West Coast/Seattle so travel time to get to a country as distant as Morocco is long - as many as three flights and over 16 hoursFairly I would have to say I had no idea a vacation in Morocco could begin to be as thoroughly fascinating, encapsulating or ingratiating as it turned out to be. Having traveled to many incredible places it takes something and/or someone special to set a new journey apart - and Rough Tours pulled this one off remarkably so. Our guide was Said, and our driver was Adi - two of the most personable, professional men I have ever had the opportunity to travel with. Rough Tours isn't just another tour - it's a total life's adventure in travel and we became connected like kindred souls with these men. Their knowledge, their insights and personal connections to you take you leaps and bounds beyond any other tours. My son found Rough Tours via Trip Advisor and what a find it was. He hit gold with this one. My only disappointment was that the trip was not longer - this simply means we just must go back and see more with them. Each phase of our tour from the Sahara Desert to Marakech brought us into connection with people from Rough Tours who were simply enchanting. I learned so much more than I though I would or could and feel great to know I brought it all back with me. Thank you again Rough Tours - for Said and Adi. . and our Magical Mystical Tour."

The planning of my trip was made easy by Youseff, and I booked the day trip to the Ourika Valley. The trip itself was beautiful and the scenery fantastic. I had a great time with my driver talking and chatting about the area, Marrakech, and life in Morocco. I am an outgoing, gregarious, and friendly person, and that I believe is where my \"but\" comes from -- at the very end of my trip, my driver asked me to \"come see his apartment\". When I said no, he continued to ask me numerous times to come back with him. I kept saying no, and had to make an excuse to get out of a very uncomfortable situation."

I travelled in solo and originally, I was just looking for a driver to take me around. I connected with Rough Tours through a personal recommendation and after exchanging a few e-mails I decided to go with them. I didn't have time to organize all the details of my trip so I was very grateful that it was all taken care of and Rough Tours even personalized my suggested itinerary to include some highlights that I didn't think I would have time for! And what a trip I had, I couldn't have asked for more! It exceeded all my expectations and it was not just the beauty of the country that captivated me. I got to personally meet quite a few members of the Rough Tours team and I have to say that they are all very professional, kind, genuinely friendly and caring people. Nothing that I asked was turned down and most of the times I didn't even have to ask....as if the guys were reading my mind. One night we were on the road at sunset and I was just thinking how nice it would be to stop and take a picture. I just reached for my camera but said nothing and found out that the driver was already looking for a nice spot for me. Another great example was the accommodation Rough Tours booked for me in Essaouria. The only thing I asked was that I wanted to stay as close as possible to the ocean during my stay there. I was very happy to get a room in a riad that was right on the water, where the waves were hitting the wall of the building and in the evening the murmur of the ocean put me to sleep. But all my other accommodations I stayed at were superb as well!During my trip not only I saw many of Morocco's highlights but I got an insight knowledge of the country's history, traditions and everyday life by people who are very passionate about their job and their country. Rough Tours' mission is obvious, they work very hard (which seems effortless by the way) to keep their clients happy and make their trip a truly memorable, unforgettable experience!  And for the highlights.....sorry but there are too many and it's impossible to rank them. Go with Rough Tours and decide for yourself which one would be the highlight for you: wondering around Fes, getting lost in the narrow alleyways, sleeping under the million stars in the desert, rallying in the sand dunes with a 4x4, enjoying the spectacular scenery from Merzouga to Marrakech, shopping in the old souks, watching people passing by in the main square of Marrakech from a terrace or taking a break from the crowds and enjoying some fresh seafood in the relaxing town of Essaouria. I will always cherish the fond memories of this beautiful trip, thanks to Rough Tours!"

It was truly an authentic Berber experience under a blanket of stars. Hassan did a great job looking after us. Rashid invited us to his home to meet with his wonderful family who were very hospitable. They served us mint tea and other wonderful local sweets. Rashid was a very careful driver and we felt safe all the way through. Hassan was enthusiastic, friendly, accommodating and very knowledgeable.

And we are so glad we did and that we did it with Rough Tours! This might sound like yet another 'review' that sounds too good for the skeptics, but you can truly put aside those fears and trust all the good things people are saying from all over the world about this great company. But really, it's the people of this company that made our trip so enjoyable and simply unforgettable. These are people of intergrity, genuinely kind and helpful, authentic and very professional (always on time, etc). These are people who love their country and love showing it to you. And as you read in so many of the reviews, 'nothing is too much for them'. - and this is true! Said and Abrahim were very flexible and were always genuinely concerned that things were ok.We covered a lot of ground - Marrakech to Essaouira to Ouarzazate and onto the dessert. We were taken through Gorges and fascinating local markets, medinas, museums, souks, etc, as we went up to Fez, Chefchaouen and Tangier. Abrahim is a good and very safe driver, and Siad told us alot about the culture and life in Morocco during some of those long journeys. The Riads were beautiful. Our 20 yr old son travelled with us and we were booked on a triple basis. It was just so wonderful that Rough Tours actually gave him his own room all the way instead of putting us all together. We really appreciated that. And the breakfasts at the Riads were wonderful!Morocco is a wonderful and fascinating country. The people are lovely and the food is great. We loved it! Thank you Youssef for organizing it all. I really wanted to meet you, maybe next time.:) Thank you Himmy (spelling?) for meeting us at the airport and looking after us in Marrakech. Place Jemaa el-Fna was amazing, especially at night! Thanks heaps Said and Abrahim. You made our visit to your country very special. You guys are the best!"

Well, I have a blast in Morocco thanks to Driss and Youssef, now I even want to host them in my country not even charging anything but just to show my culture to them in the say way they did to me.

He is nice person, very knowledgeable about the area with very well maintained Toyota 4x4, that he drives very safely. He is very friendly, with excellent English speaking skills and generally made us feel like we were traveling with a friend. He set up our day trip through emails, offered several alternatives and suggestions and customized the day to our interests. We had a great visit to a Berber market, shopped a little, got some great fried fish and generally saw an interesting counterpoint to the souks of Marrakech. He arranged for a fantastic tagine lunch with a local family in the mountains, even having them prepare a second, egg tagine for our daughter who does not eat meat. Along the way he made stops at an oil and soap coop, an herb coop and some pottery spots, but only at our request, and we definitely felt neither pressured or that he was going to receive a kickback. Later in the week, he drove us from Marrakech to Fes. Because of bad weather (it poured), we elected to take the highway, but he made it interesting, by filling us in about culture and politics and finding a great lunch spot that was clearly a locals favorite. We only had a week in Morocco, so we couldn't do an extended Atlas Mt. / desert trip, but he would definitely be our first choice for any tour or transportation needs in Marrakech if we go back.\u00a0"

Having visited the kingdom twice before, and with spare vacation days, I decided to rekindle my fascination of Morocco and discover more of its highlights if only for a few days. I have used RoughTours before on previous trips and had been extremely satisfied with their excellent service standards so to use them again was a no\u2013brainer. After a few exchange of emails with Youssef, he had come up with an itinerary that included a couple of day tours out of Marrakech which was going to be my base for five days. Youssef met me at the airport and it was like visiting old friends again. He was welcoming, friendly and attentive. My improbable list of what I wanted to do during my short visit was \u201cno problem\u201d at all. The traveller\u2019s wish list had never seemed to be a problem for RoughTours. The drive to the coastal town of Essaouira was entertaining as he regaled me with his anecdotes and sprinkled it with his usual sense of humor. His knowledge of this area is as comprehensive as of the Atlas Mountains and the desert area from where he came from. On my request, we stopped and I shopped at the Afous Argane Coop for some Argan products to take home and he later surprised me with a detour and showed me the flying goats (goats on Argan tree tops). In Essaouira, Youssef recommended a seafood restaurant that served an excellent fish tajine. Later, a short walk to the fishing harbour, the historic ramparts and finally to the colourful medina. It was a short but interesting discovery of a simple, yet charming resort town, a nice contrast to the mountains and desert.My other day tour was to the Ourika Valley but that\u2019s another great story made possible by a RoughTours guide. Morocco does not disappoint the traveler. But the right tour company can make a difference as it can take the stress out of planning logistics and allows you sit back, enjoy and just be fascinated and amazed. RoughTours is such company. See and experience for yourself."

You can probably do your own research and book your own riads & guides for a bit less. But why deal with all that hassle? But there's a reason why Rough Tours has consistently been #1 on TA. It was our first visit to Morocco, and we were frankly overwhelmed with the information and options. Our concerns were: limited time, safety, reliability, and most importantly, a chance to see the country thru the eyes of true locals. RT delivered on each item. Youssef was great from the get-go on email communication, especially considering I had many questions and revisions to our itinerary. He was accommodating, gave great practical information, and was very prompt. During our trip, our guide Amed & our driver Salim, were consistently on time and always smiling. We felt 100% safe at every moment, and 0% hassled. Kudos to Salim, who was a topnotch driver. We especially enjoyed getting to know our guide, Amed, who became a new friend. Through his engaging stories, his music/poetry, his education & background (as a nomad & Amazigh), we felt like we experienced a genuine glimpse of true Morocco. If you want the typical touristy, cookie-cutter generic tourbus, \"sanitized\" version of Morocco, then Rough Tours is not for you. We wanted the gritty, honest, sensory overload version, and that's what we got. Thanks for making our first trip to Morocco so enjoyable, educational, authentic, and unforgettable!!"

Pros: Completely private, stopped wherever we wanted, no pressure to visit venues, air conditioned 4x4, good English, knowledgeable guide, beautiful locationsCons: Winding roads might get the car sick a little worse for wear (not Rough Tours' fault though, just a bit of advice!), seemed a little \"off\" about final cash payment (I didn't tip extra beyond the agreed amount, not sure if that's customary?)Marrakech is beautiful. But it's also famous for knock-off tour providers that'll drop you into all sorts of brother/cousin/uncle stores and \"force\" you to buy things. Not so with Rough Tours. When I first saw the website, I did scratch my head and wonder \"is this all legit?\". And I can confirm that it absolutely is: there are no issues with the deposit via Paypal in advance and the email correspondence is also very good in setting things up as you require, right down to the hotel pick up. The standout thing is that the tour - whichever you choose - is private. An air-conditioned 4x4 all to yourself with one driver and one guide for our day tour to Ourika Valley in the Atlas mountains (the guys also do longer tours for days or even a week, but I didn't have the time for such an excursion). No pressure from other tour-goers, no problems to stop and take pictures wherever you like. You can even pick whether the radio is on or off, or what to listen to. Perfect. It'll cost a little more than some other providers, but I think that the exclusivity provided was more than worth it. Be warned that the roads to Ourika Valley are rather winding though, so the travel sick out there might want to bring some pills. But if it gets too bad there's no problem in stopping and no embarrasment as nobody else will be around!We knew the drill of where we'd be visiting in advance. Although I say there was no pressure to visit venues in the opening gambit of this review, part of the point of this tour was to see some of real Marrakech. We stopped off to get traditional mint tea - so take a cash tip - but that was something I really wanted to experience. Pleny of people will pass through that village with tour operators, but that's just the way things are done. Other venues that sold oil, for example, we weren't interested in visiting. Not a problem - straight back in the car and off we went, no questions asked.The waterfalls at Ourika valley are cooling and beautiful, though rather busy. The rocks are quite a challenge to climb up so you'll need to be able-bodied and wear sensible footwear. But also take flip flops in a bag so you can paddle without the stones digging into your feet. It's really refreshing in the summer heat. As much as I tend to avoid tours and prefer to do things on my own, there's no way it'd be possible to do what we did without these guys. So when a tour becomes essential to see the country I can't think of a better choice to make than Rough Tours. It opened up a wider area of Morocco to our trip, something that'll be memorable for a long time yet."

From when he turned up, on time, the next morning to introduce our guide and see us off, we couldn't have asked for a better experience.Youssef and his family have thought of everything and obviously take great care and pride in their choice of staff and the level of service they provide to their customers.Throughout the day we were well looked after, felt safe and secure (which is saying something on Moroccan roads!) and were able to relax and have a thoroughly good time accompanied by Mustapha who looked after us perfectly.I chose Rough Tours based on their excellent reviews here on Tripadvisor, which have now vanished, and I was sceptical that any company could be good enough to only get 5* reviews - but they proved to me that day that they are, and it's great to see that the standard is the same with their reviews now.Finally, I thought I was paying a premium to go with the best tour firm, not only did we receive excellent value for money, but talking to other people in our Riad afterwards, we actually paid less than them for equivalent trips and they received nowhere near the same standard of guide.Highly recommended and looking forward to using again."

I know we can just take supra tours from marakech to agadir, but with stuff like my wife's, and since this is our first time in morocco, we would prefer not to take bus.

Hassan replied very quickly on most of our conversations, \u00a0mostly during late nights and even very early morning. I gave him \u00a0my preferred itenerary and we agreed on the price.

He even picked us up in marakech airport, took us to money changer, and grocery store.We started in marakech, then to ourzazate, dades valley, merzouga where the dunes are, back to ourzazate, then to agadir. We enjoyed the trip a lot and we felt safe. Hassan is very trustworthy. We usually leave all our things in the car. He is a bit joker which is good when you are on the road for days.He is not the #1 in tripadvisor simply because he hasnt got that many reviews not because he hasnt got enough clients, but because his previous clients are not leaving comments. If your looking for a guide in morocco, id say drop him and email and im sure you can work something out."

Me and my family did a trip to Morocco where we managed to see both imperial cities and Sahara desert. Our trip was organized by Roughtours team whom we like to thank a lot for their assistance and patience with our many questions before the trip took place.Also,the Tripadvisors.Youssef was really helpful and even if he did not lead the tour, he provided us with one of his qualified guide, Ismail, who was that knowlegeable of his culture and the history of all the monument we passed by. This review is mostly about Erg chebbi which is really a fantastic attraction I 've ever been to. Youssef and his experienced team made everything more than what we were expecting. The surprising thing was that my kids felt so active and delighted to touch and play in the golden sand dunes and even when we wanted to leave Merzouga they were sad and unhappy,for they are already fell in love with the nature and the gorgeous dunes of Erg chebbi.Our camel trek was so exceptional and I am looking already forwards for another experience. Riding between the dunes while the sun is going to set was that increadible.To be safe on a camel,Moha gave us some advice on how to ride and and be well balanced at the top of this desert animal.Also, a short listen on how to wear the Berber turbon. After one hour and a half we arrived to our private camp;another surprise for us as everything was well organised and even it was a good opportunity for the kids to play sandboarding. Immediately after checking our tents that were well equipped with mattresses and blankets, we climbed the next highest dunes to enjoy and pick up pictures of the amazing sunset . I can not really explain how much my kids enjoyed that night. While being in Morocco we observed that before any meal is served, the first thing we got was tea with mint or ' Berber whiskey' as they call it. And this was the case in the camp. After having dinner, typical tajine, our guide and the camelman set up fire and started to play some Berber music and the kids in their turns danced with great excitement. Early morning,our guide called from the outside to get ready for the sunrise of which I do not have enough words to express my feeling towards the fantastic view. What really atractted my attention was the total calm in the camp and the surroundings. The kids once again started the day with sandboarding after I joined them as well. It was so enjoyable as it was my first time to board on the sand. After that we headed back to our hotel where we had our breakfast and warm shower and getting ready for the next day trip. All I can say is that our Sahara desert trip to Erg chebbi was a wonderful and an unforgettable one.We got lot of things from our Moroccan experience. Without any doubt, I am going back with my family to visit this fantastic desert in my next trip to Morocco and only with Rough tours team whom I highly recommend them to all travellers."

I am not usually a fan of organized tours, but my friends and I were really hoping to do a desert excursion. By the time we were finished, we wished we had booked much much longer with Marvelous Morocco. Iddir was incredible - everything was planned perfectly. Rachid, who we spent the majority of the time with, was such an angel. He did absolutely everything to make us comfortable and happy - plus he was so much fun. We saw so many things and made so many stops that we would have never found on our own. This was truly the highlight of our entire two week Morocco-Spain vacation. So much love to you Rachid & Iddir, thanks for everything!!! Hope to see you again soon."

We wanted to modify the trips that were posted, and Iddir made that very easy to do. Radoin, our driver and guide, was superb .... exceptionally knowledgeable, a very careful driver, and a lot of fun to be with. We spent an extra day in Erg Chebbi and had a fantastic time touring the desert with Radoin, visiting sights he knew well from living in the area. We clearly did things and went places other travelers did not do, which made the time extra special. I cannot say enough good things about the experience."

We were met at the airport by Rachid who was our guide for the majority of the trip. He was absolutely fantastic. Rachid was very sensitive and accommodating to the fact that we were a group of 4 females traveling alone. The food and Riads were all fantastic. I have no complaints and am planning on setting up another trip with this amazing company! Inschallah!

Our 1st two days were spent driving with a wonderful and very safe driver that Iddir provided. Iddir picked us up at our villa in Marrakech and took us up and through the Atlas mountains, Roses Valley, Dades valley with an overnight in Chez Pierre Hotel. Then onto the Todra Gorges, Erfoud, and Merzouga Camel trekking with a night in a Berber tent. The third day we continued our trip to Fez and spent two nights in the lovely riad Yacout Fes. The following day we went Chafchaouen spending two nights there. Iddir took us to Casablanca where we spent the night and caught our flight home in the morning. Not only did he take us to Casablanca but he picked us up at 3 am to make our flight back to the US. We were all thrilled with our trip and especially the dedication and care that Iddir provided. He was always there to make sure we were taken care of and went out of his way to make us happy! Iddir is also an excellent guide and so well informed about the history and culture of Morocco. If you are traveling to Morocco be sure to use Marvelous Moroccan Tours and ask for Iddir."

Ali arrived at our Riad on time on the first day and took exceptional care of us throughout our 4 days with him. He made sure we had plenty of photo stops (and refreshment breaks!) along the journey. We absolutely loved the night in the desert and the camel trekking. A night under the shooting stars is definitely an unforgettable experience. We also had the pleasure of meeting Iddir along our trip who was great fun too. The only recommendation I would make is to have a bit more of a structured information pack ahead of the trip. I had lots of questions ahead of the trip, as I'd never done anything like this before, which Iddir answered promptly but felt like more information at the start would have been helpful. Would definitely recommend this to anyone though! As two young females, they made us feel very safe and comfortable."

We spent 10 days in Morocco and doing the 4-day desert trip with Iddir from Marvellous Morocco tours was definitely the main highlight. From the very start, Iddir provided the highest level of professionalism, collecting us from our Riad, taking all of our bags, always making sure that we were happy and that we had a brilliant experience overall. I was overwhelmed with the attention to detail in the accommodation Iddir arranged for us. All of the guesthouses and hotels were beautiful and surpassed both of our expectations. Iddir and the staff in each hotel could not do enough to help us and cater to our needs regarding food, comfort and entertainment. More than that, Iddir treated us like old friends of his, telling us anecdotes and personal stories from his childhood about the different sights we saw throughout the mountains and desert. He made the journey very special and memorable, even bringing us to his sister's home where we were welcomed with traditional Moroccan mint tea and delicacies in preparation for a family wedding. The night we spent in the desert was amazing. Iddir arranged everything down to the last detail: we rode camels at sunset with a small intimate group of other travellers, stayed in a nomadic camp and had dinner brought out to us under the desert stars. Iddir and his friends played the Berber drums and sang while getting us involved with the dancing and music. Everything about this trip was special: Iddir was helpful, organised, friendly, approachable, enthusiastic, thoughtful and highly professional. He was as important as the breathtaking locations themselves; a tour guide and a tour company I would recommend to friends and family without hesitation. Lastly, the trip was very reasonable and was much better value for money than most other tour companies we researched. A winner!"

Everyone was raving about it so I stopped looking and decided to contact them. Iddir was very prompt and professional in his correspondence. He sent itineraries and answered all my questions. I had very high expectations because of the great reviews and I was not disappointed!We were in Morocco for 7 days but the highlight of our trip was the 3 days we spent with Iddir. We are a family of 4, my husband and I and our 2 daughters. Iddir treated us like family. We felt safe and secure unlike our other experience while in Morocco where some tour guides mainly took us to shops where we're cornered to buy things instead of see the sights. Our tour was the 3 day Marrakesh to Fez Desert Tour and it was amazing!!! Sleeping underneath the stars in the middle of the Sahara desert is a once in a lifetime experience and should be on anyone's bucket list! I highly highly recommend doing this trip with Iddir as I can guarantee you that he will look after you well. What I like about Marvelous Morocco Tours is that it's a family business and you get to meet Iddir's family along the way. We stopped by his sister's house in Rissani where we got a glimpse of the local way of life. It was amazing hospitality as she welcomed us into her home and had couscous and mint tea with her family. You can't get a more authentic Moroccan experience than that! We also met Iddir's brother, Hassani, who took care of us while in Merzouga, at the Sahara desert. He was so sweet and looked after us well. At the end of the tour it really felt like we're leaving family behind, our Berber family.Given the chance I would definitely book with Marvelous Morocco Tours again, as I'm definitely coming back!"

Every meal that you are given is AMAZING!!! Especially the night that you are out in the desert. It is seriously like you are staying in a five star hotel, desert style. Incredible. The night in the desert was let alone worth the money. I've never enjoyed something so much in my life. We rode camels into the sunset (which was absolutely spectacular), then played bongo drums, ate amazing food, and looked at the amazing stars in the desert. It was absolutely incredible. I would definitely recommend this tour group to anybody looking to see Morocco and have some fun. Iddir was amazing, and made the experience that much more awesome! He was was funny, informational, and made the trip one to remember!! I'll definitely be back at some point in my life!

We got to go to meet some of the local nomadic peolple for a little bit and get a taste of real Morrocan life.Iddir is a real local and brings a lot of his knowledge to the trip. It feels like being brought around by a distant cousin or relative. He spoke great english ( as well as many other languages) and answered any questions we had. He brough us to a lot of little off the road spots that you wouldnt get the chance to see otherwise as well as joining in on the fun. When we booked the tour, we were expecting to be sleeping in hostels or self-cooking accommodation but instead, Iddir booked us into great hotels. All weith mod cons, excellent service, food and music. We felt very welcomed and looked after in each place we stayed. Then in the evening he would check in to make sure we had everything we needed as well as teaching me how to read the stars in the desert. That he himself had learned from his grandfather. He is an excellent tour guide. He looked after us very well. We felt very well cared for and brought around. What makes me write such a positive review is that he made us feel very welcome as friends rather than just a tourist visiting. I strongly recommend him for any family visiting."

The goal of the trip for me was to wake up in the Sahara Desert on my birthday and what I got was so much more.

Iddir was extremely responsive from the very first email, and in expressing our wishes for the trip \u2013 he came through and tailored everything.

It's very important to note this tour was private and Iddir shaped it to fit our desires. We are retired and at the age of 76, with joint replacements, heart stents and a knee that doesn't always want to work, we knew we would not be able to keep up in a group. So it was the 2 of us in an very comfortable 4x4, and Iddir was our driver & guide. We asked for medium priced accommodation & were pleasantly surprised how delux the small hotels were. Breakfast and dinner were included and delicious. We could even order wine, which we found difficult in Tangier. We did an overnight camel ride into the desert which was magical. The day was 107F so Iddir made sure we were properly clothed and onto our camels in the early evening. He then showed up at dinner to make sure all was well.Our \"tent\" had a huge bed, flush toilet, sink & shower. We were lucky and able to have a private campsite, dinner, music & stargazing with story telling with Hassan our camel whisperer. We highly recommend this company for senior citizens or any age who are looking for a trip with a guide who will go out of their way to make sure you are having an enjoyable trip.Iddir owns the company and personally makes sure his guides (I think their are 5 total) fit the needs, language and interests of each client."

Our journey continued with more sightseeing and a night at an amazing quaint hotel called Chez Pierre tucked in the mountains of Dades Gorge and the restaurant dining was spectacular! The following day we headed to the Merzouga. On the way to the desert we stopped by to visit a local market, picked up some local pizza and were welcomed into his sisters families home to have our lunch. What a wonderful family! We left with very full stomachs! We continued on our drive and to our next destination where we rode camels into the Sahara desert and sat on the sand to watch the sunset. Our stay in the desert was an unforgettable experience with a night of great food, live music and star gazing. The next day we headed off to our final destination into Fez and we did a bit more sightseeing along the way. I highly recommend this tour and especially with Iddir!

If you're looking for an authentic, adventurous and personable tour of the Sahara desert, then choose Iddir and his company Marvellous Morocco Tours. We started the tour in Marrakech and Iddir was able to accommodate us on short notice as we wanted to finish the trip in Fes rather than returning to Marrakech. During the four days we experienced the authentic side of Moroccan life; local markets, BBQ, \"Berber pizza\". Some of my favourite memories were of the spectacular scenery that we saw eg Atlas Mountains, the deserts, numerous valleys or going off road in his 4x4 and seeing different oases and Kasbahs. On the first day we did an excellent tour of Kasbah de bin haddou and would highly recommend it.The camel excursion and camping in the Sahara desert is one of those bucket list adventures. The night in the Berber tents was filled with delicious food, good company and great music and dance.Iddir is very knowledgable, has a great humour and was fantastic company for the 4 days. Our desert trip was an authentic experience and I would highly recommend Marvellous Morocco Tours!"

I have traveled to over 30 countries and this was one of the most amazing and memorable experiences I have ever had! It was hands down the best tour I've ever done! We spent 3 days and 2 nights traveling from Marrakesh to Fez (one night in the Sahara desert camp). Iddir treated us like life long friends from the second he met us. Everything about the camel ride to staying the night in our desert camp was magical. We played music, danced, ate a traditional meal, and told stories under the stars. It was truly incredible! The desert camp is just part of the experience. He makes the long drive entertaining by telling stories and stopping at many great places along the way to eat and/or take pictures. His car is comfortable and he plays a variety of great music too. I can't wait to go back and spend more time touring his beautiful country. He is so knowledgeable about Morocco and its culture, I learned so much. His focus was making sure we had the best experience possible. It was the highlight of our trip! We regretted not spending more time in the desert! So if you want fun, culture, and education... go with iddir for a trip of a lifetime!"

We took a 3 night trip through the desert from Marrakesh. Iddir was very helpful and quick to respond during the booking process, and was very friendly and laid back the entire trip. He always was able to answer our questions, and was full of fun facts about the areas we drove through. The desert was amazing, and Iddir made sure to arrive at the perfect times with the best lighting, taking us around to various viewpoints to take our photos. A friend of Iddir gave us a tour around a local market in Rissani, which was so much different than the souks in Marrakesh! We were given a wealth of information in a spice shop, and were able to see the market from a local perspective - something that is still very memorable! We also had the chance to visit a local nomad store, where we were shown various authentic local craftsmanship, including beautiful rugs.All of the accommodation exceeded our expectations - absolutely beautiful! We never felt unsafe when we were with Iddir. We did not want to take the cinema tour in Ouarzazate, so he was even was able to take us (with our request) again to Ait Ben Haddou, where a guide led us on a hike through nearby meadows and rivers, giving us a view of the city many other tourists don't get.On the way home, we were suggested to a different restaurant than the usual place. This place was so off the beaten path that we had to have our order placed for us. There, we had some of the best tagine in all of Morocco, and a beautiful view, too! Would highly recommend this tour!"

Having spent nearly a month total in Morocco on 3 separate occasions this past year (and still planning to go back for more!), I can honestly say that the days I spent with Iddir and MMT each time were by far my favorite and most memorable. Of course he only has 5 star reviews. He is not capable of providing anything less. He will go far beyond what is necessary to ensure you not only have a marvelous and meticulously planned holiday, but also an authentic experience you remember your entire life. Morocco is a beautiful country with amazing people but, to a first timer especially, it can be quite intimidating and difficult to navigate if you do not speak the languages and do not have a car. Plan a trip with Iddir and you will not have to worry about these things and can just focus on having an amazing time with your friends and family and enjoy all the splendor Morocco has to offer!"

We got to see a lot, ask thousands of questions about the culture and life in Morocco and eat great fresh food. Mohammed made the trip very special for us and we even asked him to spend one more extra day to take us to Essaouira on our last day in Morocco. I expected a lot from this trip, but got so much more thanks to Mohammed and Iddir.You guys ROCK!"

I was skeptical of all the five star reviews on here and reading through the reviews there was a common theme - Iddir. Iddir runs marvelous Morocco tours and was also our guide for the 3day/2night trip from Marrakesh to Fes. He is knowledgable, personable, funny, and a joy to be around. You can tell Iddir has developed close relationships with the community as they all seem to know him and greet him warmly. What sets this tour apart from the rest is that it is an independent operator and they truly want you to have an authentic experience. We spoke with other travelers where their tour guides ended up taking them to visit an uncles shop or a workshop trying to sell souvenirs. Not once did Iddir take us anywhere commercial. Instead we visited a local market in Rissani to see how the villagers traded livestock, we visited caves where the nomads lived and would have had tea with if they hadn't moved on just a few days before, we pulled over to the side of a road to view fossils, we even had lunch with Iddir's sister and her family. Our time with Iddir was one of the highlights of this trip. He definitely deserves all those 5 star reviews. Shukraan Iddir! From Coffee and Tea!"

We had the pleasure of spending 5 days with our guide and owner of the company, Iddir, on a trip through the Atlas Mountains and Sahara desert from Marrakech to Fes. We stayed in 4 different places along the way and each and every hotel was perfect and more than anything we had expected. Iddir took care of everything; from picking us up at our Raid in Marrakech, keeping the days on schedule, planning for meals, relaxation, photo points, handling luggage, and to sharing a wealth of information on the places we were visiting and the cultures in Morocco. We especially loved the 2 days we got to spend in Merzouga and the Erg Chebbi Dunes. The camel trek was a blast and the accommodations both in the dunes and in Merzouga were fantastic! Spending the day with Iddir cruising around Merzouga was a highlight of our tour, as it is his hometown and readily shared what he loved about the desert with us. I could go on and on about how much fun we had and about the details of our trip, but to sum it up - it was a trip of a lifetime, book a trip with Marvelous Morocco Tours - and you won\u2019t regret it. Of our 3 weeks in Morocco, these 5 days were most definitely THE HIGHLIGHT of our trip.

Our driver Ibrahim really made use of the 4x4 jeep and showed us spots we wouldn\u00b4t have seen on our own. We chose the cheaper price option that included middle-range hotels and all the hotels exceeded our expectations (pretty, clean, pool, etc.). Our personal highlight was the night in the sahara. There was a bonfire, berber music, shisha smoking and a beautiful night sky with countless starts. Iddir was not our guide but we met him along the way and he is a very nice, funny and relaxed guy. One day we were invited for lunch at his sisters house, she made couscous and berber pizza for us - another highlight for us!We loved Morocco and we will be back for another trip!"

I honestly cannot put into words how surreal this trip was. My girlfriends (5 in total) travelled with Iddir, our guide, on a 4 day trip through the Sahara (Marrakech to Fes). We travelled around in a beautiful Jeep which accomodated all five of us well. Although, I was a bit reluctant to travel to Morocco with a group of young girls, I cannot stress enough how safe and protected we felt throughout the entirety of the trip. Iddir, our guide, was one of the most welcoming, knowledgeable and fun tour guides I have ever experienced. He always made sure we were well looked after and experienced authentic Morocco. If you are thinking of doing a big trip... I would strongly recommend that you look into Marvelous Morocco Tours which is much more personal. Iddir and his colleagues will no doubt be able to show you a much more authentic, wholesome and inspiring Morocco. Iddir picked us up from our hostel in Marrakech and had everything carried through the busy streets to his Jeep which sat outside of the Medina. This is where we started our amazing trip. Some of the trips highlights included:- Atlas Mountain tours (snowball fights included)-Jeep rides through the Sahara (sitting on the outside of the jeep)-Ksar of Ait-Ben Haddou Day Trip-Gorges of Dades Day Trip-Authentic lunch with Iddir's family (The most amazing and welcoming family you could ever imagine)-Merzouga camel trek/camping overnight (bonfire under the stars)-Sandboarding in the Sahara -Constant food stops in the most authentic Moroccan areas-Beautiful, clean and unique hotels I don't even think this review does this trip enough justice. This will be a trip I remember for the rest of my life. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you need further information."

Unfortunately, our luggage was lost on the airplane on our way over to Morocco, Iddir took it upon himself to call the airport relentlessly for four days until we got our luggage back! During those four days he still provided us with incredible tours while he would continuously work at getting our luggage back. During some of the long car ride Iddir would entertain us with clever riddles and funny jokes, which made the time pass quickly! He would also pull off on the side of the road to show us a magic trick or even just to have a snowball fight in the mountains. He took us to see many amazing sites and also booked us to stay in some pretty awesome hotels. There is not one bad thing to say about this guy! When we were booking our trip we were a little surprised and skeptical to see that he only had perfect reviews on here, but after touring with him, I can say without a doubt he deserves every one of them!

Iddir was an awesome guide: enthusiastic, funny, knowledgeable, and fluent in multiple languages (including English, French, Spanish, Berber, and Arabic). He took care of everything during our trip, including finding places to stay, making reservations at restaurants, securing transportation between different points, showing us around each stop on our itinerary, and hiring local guides as needed (e.g. for Fes and the Sahara). I don't normally book guides when traveling, but this was such a great experience that I wouldn't consider visiting Morocco without Iddir.OUR TRIP* 9 people* We visited Marrakech, Ait Benhaddou, Ouarzazate, Dades Valley, Merzouga/Sahara, Fes, and Essaouira over the course of a week.SLEEPING ACCOMMODATIONS* We booked our first night's riad (in Marrakech) without Iddir's guidance and had a relatively negative experience (no hot water in the showers, rude service, no breakfast). * By comparison, the riads that Iddir reserved for us were excellent (very good service, fantastic rooms, phenomenal food). * We found that many riads in Morocco have unanimous 5-star reviews on TripAdvisor whether they're good or not, so having Iddir's help finding the best places to stay was essential. The places that Iddir booked for us were also generally cheaper than the first riad we booked on our own, so we didn't pay a premium for the peace of mind.GETTING AROUND MOROCCO* Because of our group's size, Iddir secured a large van and a driver for our trip. The van was spacious and comfortable, and we didn't have any problems getting around easily.* There are random police checkpoints throughout Morocco, so having a guide who speaks Berber/Arabic and has the proper paperwork is a must. These checkpoints were not a problem at all with Iddir, but if our group had tried to rent a car and drive around Morocco ourselves, it would have been very stressful and maybe impossible.* Iddir was mindful of regularly stopping for bathroom breaks, making sure we had enough water, and ensuring we stopped at photogenic spots so we could take lots of photos :)* Along the way, Iddir also taught us about Morocco's history and culture, and was a generally cheerful and enthusiastic guide for the entire week, despite being stuck with the nine of us!* The drive between some points (e.g. Merzouga to Fes) can be quite long. This is unavoidable given how large Morocco is, but something to be aware of as you plan your itinerary. We actually didn't mind the long drives as it gave our group time to talk between points.HIGHLIGHTS* Morocco is so large and diverse that after 1 week we felt like we'd had a month's worth of experiences. From the gorges of the Dades Valley to the Atlas Mountains to the Sahara to the beaches of Essaouira, it's hard to believe we did so much in such a short period of time. * The overnight tour into the Sahara was truly astounding. I don't want to ruin it for anyone by divulging too many details, but suffice to say that this was the best part of our trip, which is saying a lot--if you come to Morocco, you MUST do this.* The riads Iddir booked were awesome--especially the riad in Dades and the Dar in Fes.* Iddir will make sure you get to fully experience the food and music of Morocco. Again, I don't want to ruin any surprises :)* The Medina in Fes has some fascinating history, and the local guide Iddir found for us was very friendly and informative.* At the end of our trip, we decided that we wanted to add Essaouira to our itinerary, and asked Iddir and the driver if they would be willing to extend the trip. They were very flexible and made this happen on virtually no notice, including finding us a place to stay and taking care of all logistics.* Morocco may be the most Instagrammable place on the planet. You're going to leave with a trove of unbelievable photos.GROUP SIZE* Iddir mentioned that he has had groups large and small (from solo travelers to groups with 50+ people). For our group of 9 people, we used a large van to drive around Morocco, but with a smaller group Iddir said he uses a 4x4."

We were a group of 9 people and decided to hire a private tour so as not to have to deal with the logistics of coordinating 9 people through a country none of us knew very well. Little did I know that Iddir offered much more than an impeccably organized tour with our own private mini bus driver. He took us to incredible Riads that we would have never found on our own. The day tours he arranged for us were unbelievably amazing. We will never forget our camel trek in the Sahara dessert or our guided tour through the maze like streets of Fes. Every included meal we had on the tour was so delicious and were some of the best meals we had of the trip. We loved the tour so much we asked him to extend it in order to take us to Essaouira which he happily agreed to and arranged incredible and affordable accommodations for us. He was a great company for our group on the long bus rides. We truly couldn't have asked for a more knowledgeable, capable and wonderful tour guide. I HIGHLY recommend Iddir for your trip to Morocco!"

I've never had a more unique and authentic experience in my years traveling than I did on this tour with Iddir.He picked us up at our hotel in Marrakech to kick off the tour - he was a wonderful, kind guide who provided amazing insights of the country as we drove along to each site that was on our tour (included Ourzarzate, Ait Ben Haddou, Dades Gorge, Todra Valley, night in Berber camp, with other quick stops along that way that truly showed you what daily life is like in Morocco). Each hotel we stayed on at the tour was spectacular - everything was just perfect.I'm already planning my next trip back to Morocco and will certainly be going to Iddir to arrange the tour."

Four women, friends for over thirty years enjoyed a wonderful tour starting in Marrakesh and ending in Fes. Our guide was extremely knowledgable of the area, having grown up in the Sahara region and living in various regions of Morocco. Iddir took us over the Atlas mountains stopping at various nights along then way. A highlight of our trip was a camel ride into the Sahara and overnigting in a Berber camp. This was a fabulous way to visit regions of morocco with a true local! We sampled dates in Erfoud ( date capital), visited a fossil shop with its own quarry, listened to traditional Berber music, rode camels into the sunset and enjoyed many stops at beUtufl historic sights along then ay. At the same time we saw a large part of the Moroccan landscape in all its splendor. Marvelous Morocco Tours made our fist to morocco unforgettable!"

Having reviewed previous comments on trip advisor my friend and I decided that this was the tour we wanted to go on and Iddir didn't let us down. From the moment we contacted him to organise by email until the moment he dropped us off in Fes he couldn't have been more helpful and kind. He made the trip an amazing experience. From picking us up in our difficult to find Riad in Marrakech we headed off on our 3nights 4day Sahara adventure. The hotels we stayed in we're all lovely, even the tents in desert were very comfortable and nice. Iddir was very informative and fun he gave us the history of the towns and cities we passed through in the Atlas Mountains, and stopping were we wished for some photos. We even got the chance to meet some of his family which was really lovely. We also met a nomad family who were also very kind and gave us some Berber whisky ( tea!). The only downside to our trip was that we were sorry we didn't book a longer trip with Iddir to show us more of Morroco. So if you can I would recommend Marvelous Morocco tours to see as much of Morroco as you can - it's a great place Even when we finished our trip in Fes, Iddir dropped us an email to see how we were getting on and if we needed any guidance or recommendations. P.s don't play UNO with him... He cheats! Only messing it was great fun. Book it and enjoy :-)"

As a rule I have traveled independently and was at first not sure about the need for a tour. It was quickly apparent that this was the way to see the Morocco beyond the sites of the cities. We (a group of 4 friends) signed up for the 4 day 3 night tour beginning in Marrakech and ending in Fez. We had great opportunities to take (hundreds of) photos, visit extraordinary attractions, ride camels, hike dunes at sunset and sunrise. And just to talk and learn about this beautiful country.Iddir's enthusiasm, particularly for the desert area and nomad life was apparent from the beginning. And it was impossible to not be caught up in his passion for his land. He gave us time to enjoy our visit, while making sure we didn't miss anything along the way. The tour with Iddir felt more like a trip of discovery with a new Moroccan friend. I would enthusiastically recommend this tour to anyone thinking to visit Morocco."

Never thought I'd say it- but listen to your mother. I do have faith that we could have navigated Morocco sufficiently, however Iddir's tour optimised our time, and gave us the breathing space to truly enjoy the magnificent country that is Morocco.For any of you researching companies, I can vouch that I did too and by far this is the best I found. And not only has it lived up to my expectations, but it has also exceeded them. Iddir's passion for the country is so evident when speaking to him, and is was the quiet moments spent with him discussing nomadic customs in the desert that really felt authentic. Every company you will find can tick the sights off your list, but Iddir's authenticity and passion makes his company something truly special. Also, the flexibility is great! You want to go somewhere? No problem! You have a mother who wants to stop for photos every kilometre...sure thing! (Of course you still have to make it to the destination as I continually reminded my mum)Thankyou Iddir for a magical trip."

Prior to arriving in Morocco, I had emailed Iddir several times to plan the trip. His responses were always prompt, thorough, and friendly.

We felt incredibly welcome and did not have to worry about anything. In addition to his vast knowledge of Moroccan history and culture, Iddir kept us entertained with funny stories and riddles along the way. This was by far the most memorable trip I have taken - and I could not have planned it on my own. Iddir's expertise, relationships with other people along our journey, and welcoming presence are what made this trip so special. We truly felt like family by the end of our tour, and leaving Morocco was like saying goodbye to a dear friend. I will definitely be back again and will always trust Iddir to help me get the most out of my visits. I cannot recommend his services highly enough!"

            "review": "Truly, a trip of a lifetime.. My boyfriend and I finished our 11 day tour earlier this month with Ibrahim followed by Iddir, and it was absolutely the most memorable and wonderful experience. If you are looking for an authentic and truly welcoming tour of the insanely beautiful country that is Morocco, this is the team to guide you. The exceptional private tour is completely catered to you, and you are guided by a marvellous guide (who drives you in their spacious, comfortable vehicles) and they welcome you like family.It is the furthest thing away from the grossly overpacked buses of 30-40 people who are herded around like cattle from tourist trap to tourist trap (during our trip we even had others who were having an awful experience ask for the name of our driver and tour company).I could go on and on about how absolutely great this team is, so I'll try to keep it brief by providing some details and tips in point form:Planning- I started with a simple email, just letting them know we were looking for an 11 day tour on specific dates- I was provided 3 levels of accommodations to chose from, and we opted for the luxury accommodations as it was a special occasion (and if it is within your budget, do chose this option - it was like living like kings and queens, including staying at a riad that Bono stayed in at Fes)- After my obsessive combing of trip advisor forums and lonely planet guide books, I was ready to ask for some fairly specific stops - none of which I needed to say, because Iddir really truly has thought of everything, and is immensely experienced. He has planned more private tours than I ever hope for the rest of my entire life. (Basically, just trust in Iddir - he really knows what he is talking about, he has gone through his beautiful country upside down and sideways - trust his recommendations)- Before the trip, we had sent Iddir a nominal deposit via Western Union and paid the remainder when we met up with him.Logistics & Tips- Airport pick up and drop off - though our guided trip did not technically start until the day after we arrived, we booked the hotel through this team and it included airport pick up and drop off, which was immensely appreciated. It meant that we landed and did not have to stress out about haggling over taxi prices or struggling to find riads or anything of that sort. Very thoughtful detail.- Our trip was a one-way direction as, we arrived in Casablanca and departed in Marrakesh. If possible, try to do the same as to avoid losing precious time going back over the same sites you have already seen.- Our absolute favourite night was the night in the desert after our camel trek - if possible, do the two nights, you won't regret it. (Also, have a small bag/backpack as taking your gigantic airplane-sized luggage isn't really convenient on camels - you can leave your luggage safe and sound at the riad at the edge of the desert)- Best bit of advice? Try the BBQ! After a few days of eating couscous and tagine (though amazing and delicious) you will crave a little something else, and the BBQ places are to die for, amazing meat grilled to perfection. The guides will know which ones are best and worth going to.- If like me, you also intend to support the womens co-ops for the hand made goods from Morocco, trust your guides to recommend you to the right places. Some of the shops in especially the big city medinas are not so reliable - our one shopping tip we received was to buy the goods where you can see them being made, which was great advice.Regardless of if you have just a handful of days or a couple of weeks, you will be in great hands with Marvelous Morocco Tours.They will welcome you like an old friend, take you to the places off the beaten path that big tour buses cannot ever go to, and share with you more about their culture and country than you could ever learn from even a million online reviews.To Iddir and his team, a million thanks! Shukran & Sa-haa!"

Iddir, the passionate, knowledgeable and inspirational owner of this bespoke touring company, lead us on a fantastic trip though his diverse and interesting country.

He went out of his way to make sure we were happy, taking us to a mix of well-known sights and the less-worn paths, along the way educating us about Moroccan and Berber history and culture and keeping us entertained with his wry humour (and terrible jokes!) Iddir clearly greatly enjoys and cares deeply about what he does, and has great interest in and understanding of people, all of which mean his tours are unforgettable. In the words of my daughter \"Morocco wouldn't have been quite as awesome without Iddir\" I really did not want to leave and hope I will be able to come back again to spend more time in the desert with Iddir.

It was one of the best decisions we could have made. Iddir was very quick to respond with a customized itinerary and the price seemed very fair. We sent Iddir a deposit through Western Union before leaving to Morocco, and spent a few days in Marrakesh on our own before starting the tour. On the assigned day our tour guide Mohammed Maazouz showed up on time at our riad with a clean and comfortable SUV. I can't say enough nice things about Mohammed. Polite, kind, respectful, a good and safe driver, and so knowledgeable about Morocco. Mohammed is Berber and grew up in the Sahara desert. He entertained us with stories of his childhood as well as giving us historical information about the cities and sites we visited. Because it was just me and my partner and Mohammed traveling together, Mohammed was able to personalize our trip every day, asking us what types of sites we wanted to see, where and what we preferred to eat, and how much time we wanted to spend at each place. For example, one morning he asked us, \"What are you in the mood for today? There is a wonderful market we could stop at on the way to Merzouga if you are in the mood to shop, or if you prefer we could visit a salt mine or an abandoned casbah I know of that is off the track of most tours.\" When we wanted to buy souvenirs he was very helpful in advising us if things were a good price, or telling us to wait until the next city or market. He never pushed us to buy from any sellers.He took us a few times deep into the desert off the road to meet local berber families. This was probably the highlight of our trip as we were able to spend time with actual families in there homes, sharing tea and learning about their life in the desert. It was fascinating! We met other tourists in Fez that had been on similar group tours and they were surprised when we told them how wonderful and personal our tour had been. They described their tour as being a large group that was shuffled and hurried along from site to site and mediocre group meals. Our experience couldn't have been more different than that, and it seemed like they had paid a much higher price for their tour.Mohammed was always cheerful and pleasant to spend time with. I feel as if we not only had a wonderful guide, but also made a new friend."

From the day I contacted them, they have worked seamlessly with me to ensure that we both get to enjoy the cities as well as tour as much as we can given the limited time we have. My impression of Morocco to be lined up with endless deserts has been changed by a wondrous experiece. We started out to tour in Marrakech and visited the medinas. Then headed to see Essouira, one which was a nice change due to the sea beside the city. Apart from these, we went to visit the Atlas Mountain, Ouzazarte, Volubilis, Rabat, Fez, and Ifrane. I was amazed how much Morocco has to offer - all thanks to Iddir who helped us plan and toured as around stating the history of each site for us to appreciate more. Added to that, Marvelous Tour provided the cheapest and most flexibility while I was budgeting. Apart from the very affordable and reasonable price, nothing was actually compromised. The riads that we stayed are spectacular and you'd know not"

As I arrange for my next holiday, I look back to last year and realise how easy and amazing it was to work with Iddir and the Marvelous Morocco team to organise and arrange a fantastic and easy going holiday! Iddir and his team are fun, fresh and very knowledgeable of not only Morocco, but also other cultures and countries. Their interactive and bi-lingual skills are impressive, which makes them very versatile to any type of traveller, but it is their familiarity and passion for Morocco and what they do which makes Marvelous Morocco Tours standout and exceptional choice for your holiday! Iddir was flexible and adaptable to any situation, from the city and souk, to the mountains and the desert and felt like we were travelling with a friend rather than a stranger, which we loved. Thank you for making our holiday unforgettable and truly marvelous!"

We started our trip in Marrakech, where we beforehand booked a 3-day trip by email with Marvelous Morocco Tours and arranged all the detailes prior to our departure. The trip was excellent, Iddir is a great driver and tourist guide and always in a good mood. He was explaining us all the way and was trying to bring us Africa closer. We started our trip in Marrakech and passing Atlas to come to the other side, closer to the Sahara. We saw lots of very interesting places - everything as posted on their website. We spent the first night in a very nice hotel with great food. The next day we continued exploring the other side of Atlas. Iddir prepared one very nice surprise - a lunch at his sister's house which made the trip even more familiar. and the whole experience more authentic. We finally arrived to the trekking point. Probably one of the best parts of the trip, riding kamels in beautiful Sahara. The berber camp is also fantastic: very well equiped (water, showers, european toilets and one or two bedroom tents). We had dinner there and then the berber party. The third day we were trying to get to Fes. However due to some bad weather (snow in Atlas) we spent the night in a hotel in the middle of Atlas (all arranged by Iddir) and the next day we arrived to Fes. I can definitely recommend this trip - it is worth the price. You get what you pay."

I found Iddir through Trip Advisor and our time with him was well worth it. We didn't have an agenda and hadn't done much research and just let Iddir lead the way. The SUV was very comfortable and Iddir told us about the towns as we passed through each of them. One major highlight for me is that he took us to his sister's house for lunch. It was a great way to really get a glimpse of local life and the meal we had there was an AMAZING Berber pizza. Seriously, I wish I could get that in the states. In hindsight, something I would recommend ,and will keep in mind for next time, would be to do a little more research so I could tailor my trip to the types of things I like to do. For example, we were driving through a town on a day when they happen to have their local outdoor market so I asked if we could visit it. Iddir was happy to oblige and I'm glad I got to see it.Marvelous Morocco Tours was really a great way to be introduced to the desert!"

As a seasoned traveler, I have experienced some truly wonderful guides and some insanely terrible guides - Our tour guide, Iddir, was the best guide anyone could even possibly imagine.My friend and I, both females in our mid-20's, decided to go to Morocco for a last minute holiday tour. From the get-go, Iddir was extremely responsive to our emails never letting our questions go unanswered. This was a clear sign of the great experience we were to have.Upon arrival, Iddir was prompt and on time to pick us up from the airport so that we did not have to wait. He then communicated to us our plans for the day. He moved efficiently through our day so that we could maximize the amount we saw. Iddir knew exactly the best places to stop to take pictures without us having to even ask. As we were settling into our lodging accommodations, Iddir was always there to ensure that we were happy with our room and would go out of his way to find us a new room if there was something we would have preferred. He kept our preference in mind as the tour proceeded.There is a clear passion Iddir shows for his work as he deeply cares for the enjoyment of the tourists. He was extremely attentive and never let a request go unanswered.Prior to enlisting with the tour, my friend and I worried that if we were joining a tour, we would not have enough time to explore the cities by ourselves. Need not worry! Iddir's tours are completely customize-able and allows time for tourists to go and discover the city on their own if they please.Traveling with Iddir was a magnificent experience as it almost seemed like we were on a road trip with a lifetime friend - who happened to be extremely knowledgeable. Iddir is perfect for all ages as he is timely, professional, and communicates well. My friend and I never had to ask Iddir for our plans as Iddir made the initiative to inform us what we would be doing and what we may need.Marvelous Morocco Tours (MMT) made our trip go extremely smoothly. Never once were my friend and I stressed, worried, or unhappy with any of the accommodations, plans, or communications. We had originally thought we could plan a trip around Morocco, but after experiencing the tour with MMT, we realized that we could never have planned a trip like the tour. Nor would the trip have been the same without Iddir.I only wish I had more friends to refer to MMT.Also, Iddir knows where the best couscous is."

Comfortably sitting in the back of his 4wd vehicle we were up, up, up into the Atlas mountains. Iddir shared his vast knowledge of his country with us. Since he was born in these mountains it was extensive. As a Berber who grew up in the area we were traveling in he knew it all and shared his knowledge with us. We definitely got the insiders view. Being alone we could ask to stop when we wanted and ask to see places not on the itinerary, too. The highlights of the trip for me were visiting a nomad dwelling in a cave really far removed from everything and everyone then another nomad family in a tent in the desert, having a lovely couscous lunch in the home of Iddir's sister, and the icing on the cake was camping in the sand dunes after riding in by camel. If you are fortunate enough to have the opportunity to do this trip, do it. You will not regret having gone."

Our lodgings were clean and comfortable, especially the lavish desert tents complete with traditional rugs and real beds! For dinner we lounged on silk pillows and ate delicious foods. ****SUGGESTIONS FOR TRAVELERS:START and END IN DIFFERENT CITIES- The tours offered in Morocco involve quite a bit of driving, I would suggest starting in one city and ending in another to avoid repetition.BRING STOMACH MEDICINE FROM HOME- The chances of getting food poisoning in Morocco are higher than in other countries. Bring pepto bismol, Imodium etc. Also meds for motion sickness as the roads can be quite curvy. Unfortunately my friends and I did get sick from some food we ate in Marrakesh\u2019s main plaza and we were unprepared.BRING- Sunscreen, small flashlight, wetwipes, good walking shoes and comfortable pants for the camel trek.Once again we thank Iddir and Abraham for a wonderful experience. We are lucky to have met such nice people who are eager to share their traditions, culture, and history with travelers."

I was spending way too much time on the internet trying to figure out a reputable company to do the tour to Merzouga so I came away with a positive life experience.  They did a tour with Rachid who I emailed directly because of his excellent reputation. Unfortunately my dates didn't work for his own personal tour but after telling him my budget he promised me he would get me into another reputable group. When I met him after, he had an associate get me from my Riad to avoid confusion and he informed me I had paid an extra 300 Dirhams which was included in our agreed upon price for a different camp and accommodations than the rest of the group I joined. Wow was I EVER glad he did that. My camp was unreal with my own personal tent with a toilet and shower. I was quite shocked because I didn't expect much in the desert and for the price. The next morning I met back up with my group and their experience was very different than mine. They had shared accomodation and not very nice toilet facilities. They also had to be up really early and spend a few hours on a camel in the morning as well which , for me, the day before was enough. I was grateful to wake up, watch the sunrise at 7:10 and after breakfast had the option to take a jeep back into town to meet the rest of the group who weren't overly impressed with there camp. Thanks again Rachid, you rock and came through for me with an unforgettable experience at a very good price. I am not familiar with dealing with the rest of the company but if they are anything like Rachid they are very professional and really care about the clients experience!"

He even took me to Starbucks at the end of the trip! We got to play in the sand dunes and the camp was more like \"glamping\" than real camping. But...I have to remove a star because nothing was on time. I understand there were variables that could not be controlled (construction, etc.). However, the itinerary said that we would be back between 6-7pm but we didn't get back until 10pm. The reason was that we didn't leave Zagora on time (it was about 2 hours later than we had agreed). We also took an unexpected trip to a spice store and to a pottery store. Every time we stopped, the driver decided to have tea and a snack, so bathroom breaks turned into half an hour excursions. My sister and I had to cancel our reservations for a dinner show because the driver could not keep to a schedule. Also, we did not arrive to Zagora on time because the driver was late in picking everyone up. We had to take the camel ride in the dark - not exactly the trip I was planning. Every time I mentioned that we need to hurry up and get there, I was shut down and told to \"stop being fast fast like a Ferrari\" whatever that means. I am very type A, so maybe this trip would work for someone who is more relaxed, but it didn't work for me."

Just beyond the village of Tamagroute, we transferred from 4x4 to camel (dromedary, actually) for a short ride to the camp. Although just on the edge of the Sahara, Tinfou does include a small selection of dunes to give that authentic desert experience. We then settled into our tented camp for the night where we were the only paying guests which was wonderful and which included a fantastic authentic meal and drumming entertainment,The following morning, we climbed the highest dune to watch the sunrise and tried a bit of dune boarding, before breakfast perched on the dunes - what a wonderful memory. This was a well organised trip with the overnight experience well away from the main tourist destinations. There was the obligatory visit to a local community/collective pottery project in Tamagroute (thank you Tariq) but the pressure to buy was not too great and this added some interest to the experience.This was definitely an experience to remember.

Less hassle from vendors although you need to keep your wits about you not to get drawn into unwanted activities such as henna tattoo or cuddling a snake. I felt safe everywhere and we did explore off the beaten track on occasions. Check prices of things like taxis before the start of activities. Beware non French or Arabic speakers - not all the taxi drivers speak English - thank goodness I had my daughter with me for the first taxi ride we took. The biggest con you are likely to experience is exchanging money at a UK airport. They quoted 8 dirham per \u00a31 but got 12 at Marrakech airport. Very easy and quick. We would have lost a third of our money. Change currency back at the same place as difficult to do so in UK.

We started in Marrakech and wanted to finish in Fez. Only they found out the day before that our bus was not leaving to Fez until the evening. Racjid and Youssef did everything they could to arrange a other option (with more people in a taxi to Fez). So that was also a good service.The only thing i could think of is that with four persons in a car there is not too much space. So i hope for the bigger people they have bigger cars :pYes, like almost every organised trip abroad, this is very touristic. This means you get to places (restaurants, sights) there are lots of tourist. Touristic also means you get to see the most beautiful places. If you don't like this, you can better go private with or without guide.Thanks again Youssef and Rachid."

Booking with them was easy and they were always very open and kind to respond quickly to our inquiries. The tour we took included 3 days and 2 nights (one in the Sahara). Overall the route (Marrakech - Fes) is well planned and includes stops to admire the landscapes (kabasas, an oasis, impressive mountains, etc) but also to stretch your legs and have a cup of meant tea or eat :) The company booked in advance local guides which were very helpful. As to the camp site, it was spectacular and with luxury standards (electricity, shower, wc). It includes a camel ride from the road to the campsite and back. Bottled water is available to purchase on the camp. We got the chance to see the sunset and sunrise.... hands down it has been one of my best experiences.Special mention to our driver Kammal who was always very very nice, respectful and helpful."

Although it wasn't a private tour, so it could have been up to 8 people, it was only us and two others who were great company. Karim even gave us a lift back to the airport on the morning of Eid - top guy"

As we didn't have enough time to go to Merzouga we found out that this was a way better option than Zagora which most companies offer. It's a bit further and you get less tourists and cooler dunes. The whole experience with Discover Morocco was amazing. From the time they picked us at the airport until they dropped us off there we felt really taken care of. Rachid is also very fast answering all kinds of questions as it felt at almost any time. We didn't hesitate to tell him any of our concerns. He was always very friendly and professional. On the day of the tour we had a very early start with Kamal, our driver and guide, who is an extremely cool and knowledgable guy, who even went out of his way for one of the meals, when we wanted to eat some sandwiches instead of sitting in a restaurant, and took us to a really nice snack place. I also got my best souvenir from the trip from him. You can ask him about it. The camp itself was amazing and Nordin (the chocolate guy as they call him) and the gang there made for a great reception and even lovelier night with drums, fire and star gazing. Thank you for everything."

Rachid was a perfect guide and host throughout the duration of the trip. My boyfriend was sick and poorly on the first day of the trip and Rachid went out of his way to look after him and make sure he was as comfortable and happy as possible. He made us laugh and had great knowledge of the history and culture of all the sights we were seeing. The driver (I didn't catch his name) was also absolutely lovely and a great driver. They both exceeded our expectations and by the end of the trip we felt like they were both friends. Highlights were sleeping out under the stars in a comfortable bed (we wanted to sleep outside rather than in the tent-the tent was comfy but we really wanted to sleep under the stars!), the music by the fire and the delicious tagine we ate at the camp. I would say that if you get travel/car sick, make sure you have some medication as the roads can be bendy and bumpy!All in all, fantastic experience and we had non stop smiles throughout both days of the trip (even though one of us was ill!)"

After a delicious tagine dinner, we met the rest of the berber tribe and spent the evening around the bonfire with music and dancing. I truly felt part of the berber people. Sunrise was no exception to the previous sights, which we were able to experience during breakfast atop of a dune. Overall, this was one of the best days of my life and I cannot simply put into words both the beauty of Morocco and the warmth of the berber people.

Went to Morocco for the first time with one friend, having 10 days to spend along the southwest and a lot of options to choose from, when booking a trip to the desert.From the whole lot of offers, Morocco Discover Tours offered exactly what we wanted: 3 days trips, with plenty to see in a tight but flexible schedule, at what seemed a fairly reasonable price, at the moment. As I write this review, I actually think it was the best spent money in all the trip.Rachid is a young, funny and versatile guide. He will not just present you Morocco as it is written in the books or just point out through the window what you're supposed to watch... He actually teaches you the way of living in Morocco, the mixed cultures, the less turisctic aspects and has a fair share of surprises under the sleeve (have you ever heard about the Berber pizza?). We were actually very lucky to be able to travel in a small pack (5 tourists + Rachid + driver) - and after the first day together, you're like family! - since it gave us the chance to personalize the tour and discuss many options and places to visit. It was a great way to experience the desert, the mountains, the monuments, the people and end up feeling like you've grown a fair share of knowledge and a secret or two about the places you visited, after only 3 days. And for solid Rachid will be the guy who has your back: he'll make sure you have fresh food every day, he'll know where to stop, he'll know what to show you and you'll fell rewarded for your choice.I really hope to come back to Morocco to a Northern/East trip to explore more of this magnificient country... And I know I'll call Rachid.Safe trips!"

We were 2 female travellers visiting Marrakesh for the first time and booked the 3d/2n trip to Erg Chebbi Sand Dunes and were offered complimentary airport transfer. Our flight arrived close to 12 at midnight and as soon as I walked out was greeted with Ismail, a colleague of Rachid. He immediately made us feel at ease. U will absolutely feel like Ur meeting a good friend instead of a tour guide. Our tour was couple days later with a bunch of other Canadians. It was great cause all of us got along great. He drove us through the high Atlas mountain and the mid Atlas. The views are stunning and he would stop frequently for us at good spots for pictures and as and when we needed a drink or to use the washroom. He is quite patient, I must admit because at times we did take our own sweet time with washroom breaks and he was totally fine with it. He is probably one of the few ppl I can say who has beyond excellent driving skills down winding roads, maneuviring with precision. That is how much of a careful driver he is. He has an exceptionally clean car with air conditioning and it's a brand new Ford, so very comfortable. He also made us an excellent sheesha and chilled with all of us, just cause we said we would liked to do that. Many companies offer this very trip to see the ait Ben haddou, ouarzazate, rose valley, Dades valley and night spent in Sahara Desert camp, but rest assure with Ismail you are guaranteed an awesome time."

The small price diference made all the difference, since a car is more comfortable and given that we were able to get a much more personal experience. I'm very glad me and my friend chose Discover Morocco. Rachid is a great guide, very knowledgeable, nice and funny. He took us to all the important place and he even gave us the chance to personalize our tour a little bit. I'll definitely recommend him to all my friend who visit Morocco and I honestly hope to see him again on one of his others tours. PS: if you're thinking of renting a car and head out to Merzouga on your own, I'd advise against. Me and my friend did so on another part of the country: money-wise it was practically the same but experience-wise we ended up missing some gems on our trip. Trust Rachid, he knows where to stop, he'll show and talk about all the hidden places, he'll make sure your food is fresh and you won't be tired from driving for hours and hours (which means you'll take more out of what he shows you)."

Morocco is such a beautiful country and we highly recommend this trip and Discover Morocco. Their guides are friendly, intelligent and helpful. The trips can be tailored to your interests so make sure you talk to your guide and let them know if you do not want to do something. For example, we preferred to get back to Marrakech earlier rather than see the TV studios so we skipped that! They are not intrusive and will give you more/less information where you show interest. Read the small print - it is a long journey so be prepared to spend around 12 hours on the road although there are plenty of stops of interest along the way and lots of information from your guide. The guides speak multiple languages. Camping is in the desert and we had a tent to ourselves, food is great and there is music and a fire afterwards.

My 2D-1N at the desert birthday experience:Friends recommended me the tour with them, specially Rachid, and it was the best advice I have been given in various years. Rachid was very responsive and keen to help even from before we formally booked the trip, recommending hotels and everything. This would only increase and get better along the trip. He and Risham picked us up from the airport and got us to our hotel. Next day picked us up early morning for a nice history lesson along the way and along a great music mix of anything you can think of. We made a great bonding since the beginning and dance in the car and everything. Breakfast was perfect, Risham's driving was exceptional, Rachid's stories, history lessons, funny anecdotes and fun facts made our morning. We stopped couple times to enjoy the views of the mountains, Berber culture, etc. We enjoyed of the famous Ait-ben-haddou where we went to a Berber's house, saw techniques of art and a lot of time to enjoy and take pics. We then headed to the desert where it was one of my best experiences of my life. On my bday getting to a camel a ride it for 1hr+ then got treated like a king by very friendly, charismatic, funny, humble and most unique Berber people, specially Negrito por el mundo. We gave ourselves nicknames, made jokes, talked about life, etc. it was full moon amd the view couldn't get better. We had dinner made and served by the Berber, which was the best I ate at Marrakech, on top of a dune with wine which Rachid helped us picking. After that we had the bonfire and music. I engaged playing percussion and guitar and to be honest I felt home, like I was spending my bday with friends and family.For my surprise they started singing happy birthday in various languages and one of them picked me up to the restaurant and there was a bday cake. That reassured me that I was part of them and they were part pf me, as well that the decision to book this tour was the best decision ever. Next day woke up early, after sleeping well in the tent, to watch the sunrise and they got us a full-on breakfst. We made our way back to Marrakesh with some stops to see the culture, how the Berber made their living, etc. it all ended dropping us to the hotel. Next day they picked us up and dropped us at the airport. Finally, I will definitely recommend this experience to everyone I meet. And even to myself, bc we all need a break like this from the stress at work or simply life. I feel really grateful and blessed for the service, gifts and efforts done by Rachid and Risham. Will never forget what we lived through and it is virtually impossible to top this birthday trip. Thanks to both for everything and making me feel at home and with friends and family. Rauluy"

This was one of the best days we had in our 4 months studying and traveling. Our guide - Youssef - made it a day we will never forget. He was very kind and informative throughout the entire day. It was our first time in Africa, which we were a bit intimidated by travelling on our own, but he made sure we were comfortable and taught us so much about the Moroccan and Berber culture. It was both an adventurous day and a learning experience. I highly recommend this tour to anyone of any age. The only thing we regret is not having more time in Morocco to book more trips! Thank you Youssef!!"

I've been on camel safari in Morocco before but this was the first time for my 20-year-old granddaughter - and the experience would be the highlight of her short one-week vacation. Thanks to Rachid, it was everything we hoped it would be! He was professional in every sense of the word, making sure we were well-cared-for even on small things, like brief rest stops. He was informative without being intrusive, and we learned so much about Morocco's culture, history, flora, fauna, etc. The desert camp was luxurious, far better than my previous experience. Really, the rave reviews are well-deserved and you couldn't book a tour with a better company!"

            "review": "Best Birthday Surprise EVER- Thank you, Rachid for making us feel so SPECIAL and LOVED ! Expectations exceeded !. It was my second trip in Morocco so i have a good base to compare and i must say Rachid exceeded my expectations and managed to make me and my partner feel so special...The first time I did this crazy road trip, we were with a local guide on a private tour which was quite exotic (think sleeping on an old carpet in the middle of the palm trees with the muddy river as our luxury swimming pool in hot August).I must admit I had reservations if the group tour would be as good as the private one (i am a fan of authentic experiences) but being on a very tight budget and with limited time to organize, I started contacting the best tour operators on Trip Advisor...All of them said they don't organize group tours which is quite understandable considering it's half the price... and just when i thought it's impossible to go to the desert for less than 350 euros per person, Rachid replied- YES and i was so happy and excited...120 euros for 3 days including petrol, 2 breakfasts, 2 dinners and 2 nights, 2 guides... sounded more than reasonable... He replied to all my emails very quickly and accommodated even the smallest request- from organizing vegetarian meals to recommending a good hammam for our last night in Marrakesh...What i didn't expect was the BIG surprise Rachid had prepared for my birthday... In a country where so many people try to take as much as possible from the tourists (understandably so as this is their main source of income) and during their high season, Rachid decided to reduce the initially agreed price by 50% purely because he couldn't be our guide (his group tour was cancelled in the last minute but he didn't cancel ours). On the morning when he came to pick us up at the agreed time , he gave me a beautiful silver necklace with Fatima hand which i felt protected me throughout the whole trip (totally unexpected as i am just a stranger, a customer who happens to have a birthday) and then announced that the last surprise is that instead of being in the camp with the 2 groups (which we later discovered had no toilet, running water or any facilities but tents with 6 mattresses), we will be alone in a luxury camp as a birthday present.... What an experience- just the two of us on the camels in the middle of the sand dunes watching the sunset, a whole camp for us with 3 friendly, welcoming people waiting to serve a beautifully presented, delicious 3 course meal that we were trying to finish as it was so good but we were too full just after the delicious starters... the tent had a king size bed, en-suite bathroom with hot water powered by the solar panels just next to the camp, everything was immaculately clean and it was our best night in Morocco (even if we stayed in good riads in Marrakesh)... Just the perfect 5* gateway - Desert Camp Bouchedor True, the private tour allowed more freedom to explore many places... but did I feel like a princess? We saw so many things- beautiful canyons, high cliffs, green mountains, the highest desert dunes, exotic palm gardens- a diverse landscape offering so much to photographers like us that we beat our own record with the 1600 photos taken in just 4 days :) recommend it ? absolutely, undoubtedly, totally YES ! For couples, for friends, for families, for solo travelers.... You will all have an experience that will stay with you long after you are back home.... so different from the all inclusive type of holiday when all you do is sunbathe, eat and explore the souks in Marrakech (not that this is bad- it's ok for people who need a total break from everything) .... but this will give you MEMORIES FOR LIFE.... truly magical..."

Our experience within this tour and thanks to our private guide Youssef Ait Addi was simply an unique life's experience. Our adventure started in Marrakech to end in Tinfou Dunes. During the trip we crossed a lot of beautifull places; and even if we needed to respect the timetable to arrive in time in Tinfou to see the sunset, our guide was placed to stop the car whenever we wanted to have some picture and have a walk in such amazing countryside. On the way we also visit many point of historical interest. When we arrived there were camels waiting for us in our camp into the Dunes. We spent an unforgettable night with the guide and the Berber Trib, who were singing and playing bongos for us. Your guide to the desert and the people who you gonna meet there will be part of your journey so is very important choose the right person. Thats why we want to recommend this tour and Youssef as your guide: he is a good speaker of English, a good driver, is very available to any request and he knows how to be professional and close at the same time. He is going to take care of you!"

Ishmael our guide spoke excellent English and made very well planned stops throughout the day. The evening with the Bedouin was great fun and we were surprised to have our own tent even though it was a group tour. The camel ride was good fun with the group. Being in a group wasn't a problem at all, I would definitely recommend this over a private tour, which is much more expensive. There were only 2things which were slightly disappointing: the food at the road-side stops was not very tasty, and tourists prices. Also the Tinfou Dunes are not massive, I was expecting Sahara-like landscape but the dune rises out of the flat rocky desert. But these things didn't ruin the trip and overall I would definitely recommend this tour. The Moroccans couldn't have made us feel more welcome and really made the experience enjoyable."

Rachid answered lots of questions by email and gave me some great advice and I chose a private tour to Tinfou. Rachid came with Kamar to meet us on the day of departure then we left with Kamar for the drive over the Atlas Mountains. The weather was quite bad and the snow got pretty heavy as we got higher. Kamar drove really well and was very patient when my daughter felt car sick. Eventually we were turned back as the snow had closed the road. So we regrouped and took another option to visit the waterfalls. The following day Rachid and Kamar took us to Essaouria for the day. We had a brilliant time. Rachid looked after us so well and organised a guide in Essaouria. He chose the best of the fish and seafood and had it cooked fresh for us. We all enjoyed an amazing lunch. It was a wonderful day with a lot of laughs and good fun. Rachid and Kamar are great guys who really look after their guests. We will return another time and definitely do that desert trip!!"

The duration of our trip was long, but to reduce boring discomfort, Rachid let us stop whenever we wanted to take pictures, go to the bathroom, or just to refuel our bodies for the duration of the trip. Never once did he make me feel rushed during our stops. When we arrived to our destination in the desert we kept our bags in his car so we wouldn't have to take them with us on the camel ride. After the camel ride he met us at our camp site right away and asked us how everything went. He seemed very receptive and intuitive to all of our needs and when we all wanted to have privacy within our group. On the trip back he was just as good about letting us stop whenever we wanted. He was always attentive and he never ceased to make my group and I happy, plus we all had good conversation with him. All in all the trip was excellent and I would recommend Rachid to anyone."

We were all in the same age.I like roadtrips and you drive a lot!!! For me it was the perfect way see the beautiful landscape of this country. Everyone in Marocco drives crazy. Our guide (forgot his name) was a very good driver. I felt nearly always safe except when he drove sometimes with 70 km/h just 2 m behind another car. But he saved our lifes as he evades very quick off the road as another car was falsely on our lane in a curve. That was very good, because the passenger airbags were turned off!!! We were also not allowed to turn them on!!! We did not get a lot of information about the country from our guide. Unfortunatelly I recognized only now that we neither visited the town Telouet nor the Atlas Film Studios!!! Instead we had lunch in overprized restaurants with dry chicken. Just at the third day we could conviced the guide to bring us to a local place. 6 people ate for the same price as one did in the other restaurants. He also brought us to shops, but himself bought his water and snacks somewhere else... this is embarrassing!!! We had also no chance to dicover A\u00eft-Ben-Haddou alone. We were pushed through the town by another guide without information.The first night was in a clean hotel. There was also a maroccan family and we did music until the night. This was very nice.I have no problem with stopping at local manufactures and cooperatives which want to sell blankets, argan oil and carpets, but then I also want to stop at a beautiful place to enjoy the landscape and do some photos.The tour to the berber camp by dromedary was organized very well. We had a spacious dinner with other young groups. Then there was music again but everything was agganged and inauthentic. We got very good information from the desert berber guide and enjoyed the incredible stars in the sky.The last day was just driving. I liked it, but we did actually just stopped for lunch.All in all a good way to see the country. I had a lot of luck with my group. The guide did a good job driving us around, but a very bad job giving us information about his country. That he also forgot to bring us to Telouet and the Film Studios brings me to the conclusion that I can not recommend this company! I also do not understand why the passenger airbags were turned of! An answer from the company would be nice."

Overall, I feel that Discover Morocco offers us a peace of mind. no worries about pick up from the airport, getting from A to B, accommodation and what we are going to eat on a daily basis? its all pre-arranged to your personal preference. Personally, for me this is my ideal holiday/break. It takes you away from the daily routine of work etc in your normal daily life and truly gives you that relaxation that you need when you getaway!

Everything was great until the pottery tour guy explicitly asked for tips when we refused to buy any souvenirs from him.

We requested to end our tour in Rabat and he stayed with us all the way even helping us communicate with our Air BNB host. He even got us souvenirs! They go out of their way for us and we appreciate it!Its only made better thanks to the unbelievable landscape of Morocco and the desert! Thank you so much for everything! Best experience ever!

We have signed up for a group tour but ended up with a private tour, which was definitely a bonus. The trip does involve lots of driving but our drive made it easy by constantly telling us about the landscapes. The desert was well worth the drive. We were also not forced to buy anything which we felt might have been asked if we had taken other tours in Morocco.For its price, I would definitely recommend this tour to anyone going to Morocco!"

            "review": "The Most Memorable Trip of our Portugal/Morocco Vacation!. Prior to booking this trip, my friend and I searched many companies offering a very similar experience throught the Atlas Mountains and Zagora Desert. Several were far more expensive and seemed to offer the same exact thing. After reading reviews, pricing and communicating with the others, we chose Discover Morocco Day Tours and the 2-day Tour to the Desert. Rachid was fantastic in completing our booking, confirmed with us the day before and was punctual when he sent for someone to pick us up promptly the morning of the tour. Our guide, spoke fantastic English, had a great sense of humor and was incredibly knowledgeable of every town and culture of the \"Berbers\". The first stop was in Ait Berka for Breakfast of which was a cute spot with fantastic tea and coffee overlooking the mountains, next we passed through Aglmous Village then stopped for lunch in Ourzazate. The drive continued through the vast mountain range passing through Ait Souen, Agdez, Zagoura City and then we arrived in Tinfou Desert. Upon arriving in Tinfou Desert we were immediately greeted with two Dromadaire (Camels with one hump not two) I quickly learned! Lol. We rode them for about 45-60 min and our guide for the ride was adorable he would stop in several spots to take pictures of us. As the sun came down it was quite unique to see the moon coming up over the mountains at the same time. As the ride concluded we were greeted by our tour guide and the Berber community at this camp. We had a great dinner, bonfire, music (they are so talented!) and slept in a tent. In the morning, we were served tea/coffee and pastries before we hit the road. On the way back we stopped in Kasbah for lunch and the tour of a famous location where many movies were filmed. In fact, they were filming one while we were there. The village is elevated of what appears to be in a mountain and centuries old that certainly takes you back! It was a wonderful and very memorable experience and I would certainly do it again! Thank you Rachid for your wonderful hospitality and for making this experience possible!"

            "review": "...Zagora Desert trip..a Tourist Trap...Very Disappointing.... I have chosen this travel agency after all great review on Tripadvisor.I was ready to pay more, and when you are ready to pay more YOU MUST READY TO RECEIVE MORE\u2026Unfortunately it did not happen and besides the service received, also the tour itself, it is not such a great tour,At the end I would say, be ready to find the cheapest tour as all of them offer the same service, at least you will not feel robbed.Here my personal comments1) The promised English speaking guide turned out to be an elementary English knowledge guide.2) As the lunch was not included, I would expect to have the possibility either to eat with the entire group or to eat somewhere else, or go for a walkHe always took us in the restaurants he wanted without giving us any alternative. On the way back we stopped for Lunch in a stranded place, in the middle of nowhere.Therefore no other places, or possibility to do something different.3) We were promised to have a private tent, for 2, when we arrived the guardian told us that all of tent are for 4 people and he would not have cared.Besides he was smoking JOINTS..yes JOINTS...he even asked my gf a rolling paper, in front of us, and the guide left us to go to the camp on ourselves with locals without any support. At least he would had came with us and check if everything was fineBefore leaving all group alone. We were told: other companies are cheaper because they offered tent for 8 people. The real truth is that ALL TENT ARE FOR 4\u20264) Food quality in the desert is really poor from Dinner to Breakfast5) You ride the camels just before the sunset is over.6) The camp is just located on the border of the desert just a couple of Dunes, if your expect to be surrounded by Dunes, forget it7) Ait Ben Haddou, the only place, which was worth visiting and maybe staying there to have lunch walk around, I gently asked: why do not we have lunch here? The guide answer: because we take you to a placeWhich we trust\u2026.well we ended up in a small caf\u00e8/restaurant in the middle of no where\u20268) The tour should be tailored IN A BETTER WAY\u2026I talked to Rachid and he offered me a compensation of 400 Dirham, which was a good-gesture form his side, and he felt sorry, however instead of the compensation he tried to offer me a complimentary taxi to the airportAffirming that for a transfer to the airport at 04.30am next morning, would had cost euro 30/35\u2026well I gently denied his offer and I took back the 400 Dirham, in fact the taxi cost me JUST 70 DIRHAM/7 euro\u2026At the end I would suggest, if you really want to make this kind of trip (I will not do it again even for FREE..LONG DRIVE..all curves/bends), check for the cheapest company which offer you the same tour for 50/55 euros. You can also have (asking) the transfer from airport upon arrival to your accommodation. At least you would not be disappointed with all great expectations."

My boyfriend and I booked the 3 day Desert Tour with Rachid after we compared many different tour & excursion companies online. Not only was the price the best out of 6 that we asked, Rachid was the only one who was patient with all of our questions and emails. You'll be amazed by how fast he replies! The trip was amazing from beginning to end. On our first day, Rachid came and picked us up from our riad on time like he said, helped carry our heavy backpacks to the car, introduced us to the friendliest driver, and our wonderful journey begun. Every stop we made on our way to the Sahara was amazing. Rachid would explain the area and sites to us, give us as much time as we like to explore the place, and even help take wonderful photos for us. & because of Rachid, we also met some of the most amazing people, including the local Nomads, Berbers, and our camel ride guide Hassam. By the end of this tour, we truly became good friends and promised he'll always have a place to stay if he came to visit us in Canada! If you are considering any type of excursions or tour in Morocco, definitely go with Discover Morocco Tours! After a long 3 weeks of visiting Italy, France, and Morocco, my boyfriend and I both agree that the 3 day Desert Tour was definitely the best part of it all. Thank you again, our Moroccan brother Rachid!"

Discover Morroco was recommended to us by our Airbnb host, who has been living in Marrakech for years and has firsthand knowledge of the local tour companies. We couldnt have made a better choice. We took the 3 day desert tour, which was perfect. (I recommend at least 3 days to get in all the good sites/activites). Our guide Abdel was amazing - his knowledge of the Morrocan history and landscape was astounding. Not to mention he was a really fun guy. To top it all off, after the tour, Rasheed, the owner, invited us into his home for dinner (homemade Tagine). It was clear this was way more than a business transaction to them. We made friends that we still keep in touch with to this day. Do yourself a favor - if you visit Morocco, take a tour with them. You won't regret it."

Both days were excellently organised. Almost everything is included in the total price (which is competitive), so no worries during the trip. Good lunch is included. They use local guides on the different locations to show you around. It were both private tours with a comfortable car and Youssef as a responsible and polite driver.Besides that, it felt like we made new friends. We listened to music, were joking with each other and talked about Morocco and things in life. It makes the trip personal and therefore memorable. No doubt we would book with them again.

My wife and I visited Morocco for the first time and we booked the 2 day Sahara tour with Discover Morocco based on the excellent reviews online and our own experience is no different. From the moment we sent our inquiries, Rachid was very prompt in answering all our many questions before we even booked their service. We are very pleased we decided to go with Discover Morocco. From the time we were collected in our Riad at Marrakech, to our many significant stops at the Atlas Mountains, Rachid made everything as smooth as possible, he was very knowledgeable, flexible with the schedule and our route. Each step of the tour has its unique and amazing impact on me and my wife. Particularly noteworthy to us is how Rachid involves locals outsourcing so they would also earn and the local economy benefits. We stopped at a local cooperative at the Atlas mountains, Rachid worked with locals in the Sahara, from the camel ride guides, to the nomad camp where we stayed. On the way back the following day Rachid involved another local guide when we stopped at Ait Ben Haddou. We had an amazing time from start to finish. We learned a lot from Rachid, met amazing people, partake into the local culture and totally enjoyed the sights and sound of the Sahara. First hand experience from picking dates from trees, stopping at Henna farms and showing us some local cotton trees. I rarely give a 5 star rating. Discover Morocco has exceeded my expectations and deserves the 5 star rating. Its all worth it. If we are to have another trip to Moroccco I would not have second thoughts booking another tour with Rachid."

Rachid was a wonderful guide and went out of his way to make the whole journey as interesting and personally tailored as possible. Our first day we drove through the Arlas mountains and filled our eyes with amazing sights. We also stopped at a woman run Argan cooperative and my biggest regret for the trip was I didn't bring cash to buy the products - they were amazing and the woman who showed us the process was very informative. You cannot believe it but we actually got rained out of the Sahara desert the first evening so we could not to ride the camels to the camp but Rachid rearranged for a dawn ride which was amazing! In stead we had impromptu delicious tea at his friends house and shop and then we drove to camp where we honestly ate the best Tagine we've ever tasted. We were serenaded by drumming and songs by a campfire under stars that night. And we woke up the next day to watch the sun rise from the top of a sand dune - and of course ride the camels! The second day was equally fantastic - Rachid stopped to buy us the best dates from the Draa Valley and we even stopped and picked them fresh off the trees. We also visited Ait Ben Haddou and had a personal tour of it and inside a local home. At all times Rachid was full of local and personal knowledge about the Berber people and culture, and ever ready to answer my many questions. We can't thank Rachid enough for our amazing time! We will definitely be back!"

From the moment, we landed in Marrakesh, we were well looked after by Discover Morocco . The friendliness and hospitality was really lovely especially since we were travelling with our children. The whole booking and organisation of the tour was really good. Also, I feel what made it so special is that our input of what places we wanted to visit was taken in account. A copy of the Lonely planet was good to have as a guide when discussing with the tour operators of what and where to go!Overall, we travelled north to Fez visiting many places en route with plenty of breaks which made it quite a chilled out experience. It didn't feel that you were always in the car! Amazing views we saw as we took the Atlas mountain scenic route.Two days in Fez was wonderful. To experience the wonderful historical and cultural experience with our city tour guide. Quite a contrast from the hustle and bustle of Marrakesh. In my opinion, Fez was quite laid back and relaxing while staying in a beautiful Riad in the old Medina. Our journey took us south to the Merzouga desert with daily activities en route. Observing the monkeys and horse rides. Again, the journey was long but well-planned so there were sufficient breaks to relax with the locals. I've experience desert camping before but Merzouga experience was out of this world. A camel ride to our camp, which took 2hr and then greeted with Morocco Tea on arrival. The food was like a banquet and the accommodation was clean with excellent bathroom facilities. The camp fire and the singing was uplifting to experience.The rest of the tour involved travelling west back to Marrakesh. Gorges, mountain villages etc. After an overnight stay in Marrakesh, we were travelled for a few days to Agadir which was arranged by us but, Discover Morocco arranged the transport.. Since, we travelled from London to Marrakesh, we had our outbound flight from Marrakesh. we phoned Discover Morocco who arranged transport back to the airport.what more can I say except I'm going back at Christmas!!!!!"

We were collected at our hotel by Abdull spot on 8am and taken to our transport for the day. He was great at explaining what we were going to do and in what order and sharing information as we went.Our first stop was at a Berber house for breakfast, I am always sceptical about these types of visits as ones I have been to in the past feel like set up houses but this felt so real. We wandered down a path through a gate in a wall and were inside a little compound, the family greeted him as a long lost friend and there was a genuine warmth on both sides. He showed us their personal Hamman and how they would light the fire to heat the water for it, onto the animal area where there were a couple of cows and a week old calf. Back to the house and he showed us where the stream outside had been channelled through the wall for washing and then into the kitchen area. The cooking area was two open fires where pots, tagines, trays could be placed over them. We were taught how to make mint tea, which was lovely and watched as our bread was cooked on the open fire. It was served with butter from the cow we had just seen and was like cottage cheese in texture and just the most amazing taste, there was honey (local and the most amazing ever) and olive oil. I could have stayed there all day eating that!Then on to our camel ride, just 20mins and to be honest that was enough to say we had tried it, Abdull took some great photos of us and we had a little caravan going as there were 3 camel calves that wandered along with us. The owners were lovely and also took photos and encouraged us to hold the camels while they did, no hint for tips simply nice people. On to the Atlas Mountains and we met another guide who trekked with us up through two villages where we had lunch at the 3rd on a balcony with amazing views. More mint tea and a tagine as requested by Abdull when we expressed an interest in them.On the way back to Marrakech we stopped for our quad biking, which was fun but the goggles are not that clean so a bit hard to see through at times.When we got back to Marrakech as we were not sure how to get back to our Riad from where we had parked Abdull walked back with us without hesitation. We were contacted by Rachid afterwards to make sure we had enjoyed our day and offering a free airport transport if we wished, having already arranged the hotel we declined but otherwise it would have been brilliant. All together we had been out from 8am to 6.30 by the time we got back, what a day!"

We left early in the morning and arrived in Tangier by mid-morning. Not having selected a tour guide beforehand, upon our arrival we were greeted by several industrious but questionable people. But then an middle aged man approached us and assisted us navigating our way through customs. He showed us his credentials and we decided to use him as our tour guide. His name is Foad Bssari from Discover Morocco Tours. Foad proceeded to take us on a wonderful all day tour of Tangier. His English is excellent and he was not at all pushy. We had a magnificent, thoroughly enjoyable and easygoing, walking and driving tour for 6 hours or so. Our experience in Tangier wound up being one of the highlights of our entire vacation. We saw local markets, religious and cultural sites, did some sightseeing, a little shopping (where we picked up some amazing, authentic Moroccan spices that we cherished and enjoyed when we returned home), and had delicious coffee (the only thing we were brave enough to drink or eat while we there) at a local coffee shop. I cannot emphasize enough how wonderful Foad was with us. He is a true gentleman and a great ambassador for Tangier. I look forward to returning to Tangier and using him again."

Glad that we booked it during our holiday in Morocco.Rachid is a very cool person - not the tour operator really, but more of a friend!The 2 day tour is very well organised by Rachid in a fancy AC car. We travelled quite a lot of KMs in 2 days visiting UNESCO heritage sites and many other. The final destination was Zagora desert where we stayed in a camp overnight - good food and wonderful experience.I would surely recommend this tour from Rachid as it is not only cheaper than others but very personalised and friendly as well."

My colleagues from the travel industry recommended Discover Morocco and we booked three trips with them. That was definitely the best decision, as we had a fabulous time with our guide Rachid and our driver Essaleh there. Both were very professional and disposed of a huge knowledge about the country, culture, history and locals and revealed a great sense of humor. Especially the fact that on all three tours it was only the two of us and no big groups was a huge bonus. Our trip to Morocco was my first, but certainly not my last one there... If anyone intended to travel to Morocco, I would definitely advise to book their tours with Discover Morocco, especially if anyone is looking for a tailor made, private tour. Even if there might be other companies which offer their trips for less: I doubt they can offer the same professionalism - Some I kept track on myself and they were noncompetitive by far and even gave wrong information about history and culture."

We booked a 2-day tour from Marrakech to Zagoura desert with Rachid. It was a great experience, from the minute we were picked up at the riad we were staying at, to the drop off in Essaouira. Rachid and his colleague did everything and beyond to make us comfortable and to show us as much of Morocco as possible. We not only visited the major sights, but also got an insight into the lives of local people, local cuisine and customs. The night in the desert was amazing! Tents were big and comfortable, we even had regular bathrooms, all in the middle of the desert. This review is long overdue, but to summarize, I warmly recommend Rachid and his Discover Morocco Tours agency. Next time, I would book a longer tour with them!"

I would say they do more than needed to make people feel good/comfortable/happy. I couldn't be happier that I choose this touring company, and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to have an amazing time, and at the same time learn everything there is to know about the Moroccan culture.Essaleh, stay awesome bro."

The tour itself was amazing, Rachid is a brilliant guide with a wealth of knowledge about all aspects of Morocco, our driver Abdul was also by far the best driver I had during my whole stay in Morocco. I was on the tour as a single female with another couple , whilst my husband participated in a race and by the end we'd all become great friends.

Our 12 year old son is adventure mad but our 9 year old daughter is very shy and wasn't sure about the walk in the valley. Both had a fantastic time. We stopped at a Berber house first where Rachid explained the various rooms in the house and talked about the Berber people. We also went on a short camel ride which delighted my daughter.The walk through the valley to the waterfall was amazing. Rachid hired a fantastic guide for us who held our daughter's hand right through every tricky bit and made sure she was completely safe. We asked to turn back at one point, thinking it was getting too much for us, but he assured us that she could do it and she was SO glad she carried on! The views were spectacular and our son is now desperate to come back to Morocco to properly tour the country.Rachid was extremely efficient, from the first email to enquire about prices through picking us up from our riad. It's always a bit nerve wracking booking an unknown guide, but I would highly recommend Rachid. He made both children (and us!) very happy.(I have photos which I will add later!)"

            "review": "The Real Morocco. We were a group of 4 girls who signed up for a 4 day 3 night private tour of the desert from Marrakesh with Discover Morocco tour. We were fortunate to have Abdul as our driver and Rachid as our guide. The excellence of our tour started from the time we landed. Although we were only due to start our tour on the following day, Rachid arranged for us to be picked up from the airport and he also ensure we were brought to our hotel. He told us what time he would arrive the next morning and also kindly offered his personal contact number just in case we got lost in Marrakesh that afternoon. We started our tour travelling in a comfortable SUV car and I must compliment Abdul on his excellent driving even on the curve roads along the Altas mountains. There is quite a bit of travelling by car throughout this tour to get from one town to another however the end destination is always worth the long journey. Rachid would give small talks along the way while we drove in perfect English. As the tour was private , the start timings each day was flexible and we could ask to stop along the way at scenic places if needed. Off the road, Rachid is happy to share more about the local experience in Morocco - more of the current picture rather than the history which one can easily read off the internet. Hence why the title the Real Morocco as it was interesting to learn about Abdul and Rachid perspective of current issues. They were also always happy to answer any questions we have about the country and its culture. The choice of hotels during the tour were also fantastic - each having its own charm. The highlight of the tour for me had to be driving through the Altas mountains and seeing its majestic views - although slight warning to those who are prone to motion sickness that it might be a difficult ride. The overnight stay in the desert is also a once in a life time experience which I highly recommend. To end of our visit to morocco, Rachid extended his generosity on our last night back in Marrakesh with a home cook tagine meal and freshly brewed mint tea. This was not on the tour outline but an extension of friendliness of our guide. Overall, this is a fantastic tour company to go with if you want to experience the real and amazing morocco. Our group of 4 girls always felt safe on the tour and Abdul and Rachid made it their personal mission to keep us entertain during the long car rides and well feed with good moroccan food. I would highly recommend this tour ! Thank you Discover Morocco!"

Abdell was a wonderful guide who really took the time to explain things about Moroccan landmarks/cities and the Berber culture. In addition, Abdell shared some beautiful traditional music with the group that really enhanced the experience :) All of the restaurants and accommodations were superb, and I got to make friends from around the world. Our group even had the opportunity to try on traditional clothes, and visit a Moroccan weekly market. The camel ride was very fun, and the night in the desert was almost surreal.

It was a great trip. Rachid and his friend picked us up in the Medina at 7 am we then drove through the Atlas Mountains with plenty of stops for the kids. We visited a Berber village where we had a lovely lunch. We then drove to the desert through incredible scenery. We had an hour long camel trip to the tents and then returned to Marrakech the next day. They were great hosts very friendly, and good with children. We found it really interesting hearing about Morrocan culture and way of life. They also introduced us to some great music. Highly recommended if you are staying in Marrakech to get out of the city and see rural Morocco. Also if you are travelling independently they arrange for a driver to meet you at the airport which makes for a very easy start to the holiday. Nothing was too much trouble and they did their best to make the trip as interesting and comfortable as possible. Also we felt 100% safe - no need to have any concerns about leaving the city. Happy to answer any questions. Thanks again Rachid. Cath, Liam, Dom and Ollie."

I know most of you are probably wondering where to start looking for all the details or wondering what would be a good deal or not, etc...Look no further, Rachid the tour guide will handle all the logistics of getting you to the dessert and back, but will also take you to the non-touristic approach along the way. We occasionally stopped to try local fruit on the side of the road, ate at great restaurants, and had an amazing time in the dessert.Thanks again Rachid!Alex & Michelle"

As we had limited time, we chose the day trip experience to the Atlas mountains which included a trek to a waterfall, tea and breakfast with a Berber family, a camel ride and a quad bike trip. We were initially drawn to the tour due to the variety of activities, all within one day, and the reasonable price (I did not come across any other tours like this whilst researching online). From the moment I enquired about the tour, Rachid was incredibly helpful and not only booked us in on the day we had suggested but also arranged to meet us at the airport on our arrival (despite arriving two nights before the date of the tour). Rachid was our guide for the day and Abdul our driver, both were so friendly and welcoming. Every moment was fun, interesting and insightful! trip really made our stay in Marrakech. Thanks again!"

The people we met along the way were amazing and friendly and accommodating to us visiting.

            "review": "Believe the reviews... this really is the best tour company we came across in Morocco. We took a 1 night excursion to the town of Mhamid which is situated south of the Atlas mountains and is the last town before the Algerian border. It was a truly unforgettable experience and I highly recommed Discover Morocco Tours. We paid 4,600 Dirhams (about 460 Euros) for two people in cash because paying by card would have incurred an extra 45 Euros charge from the bank in Morocco. Our only recommendation to Discover Morocco Tours is to try and find a way to reduce the commission as paying by card would have been so much easier and convenient for us. A few days before, we had gone on a terrible excursion with one of the cheaper tour companies to the Ourika valley and completely regretted it. They just wanted us to spend money at many stops and didnt care about our experience. Discover Morocco Day Tours on the other hand, was the opposite! Rachid is very friendly, knowledgeable and keeps his promises. Rachid and his driver picked us up at 7am as promised. The journey through the Atlas mountains is long and heavy going, but his land cruiser is very comfotable and it made the 10 hours (in one day) a lot more bearable. We took many bathrooms stops and the cultural stops were insteresting and there wasn't any pressure to spend money. The scenery on the way to the desert is just stunning.When we arrived in M'hammid (around 5pm) we were greeted by Ismail, one of the Berber guides. We went by camel into the desert and arrived at the berber camp in time for sunset. Needless to say we took many (many!) photos. There was full moon and the peace and light of the desert is something everyone should experience!Ismail served us tea when we were finished with our photo taking and he seemed genuinely interested in talking to us. His helpers cooked us a tasty tangine and the singing began to the beat of the African drum. We had our turn on the drums and didn't do quite as well but it was fun and we had a lovely evening. The boys then took our beds out of the tent and we slept in the open air. Again, magical, romantic.... we loved it! We set the alarm for sunrise (6am) and after taking so many photos of the morning light on the dunes (again, stunning!) we headed back to M'hammid town on our trusty camels and then onto Marrakech by car. We were truly exhuasted on the journey back but Rachid couldn't have been more kind, helpful and attentive. Thank you Rachid for being an honest and accomodating guide. We highly recommend this tour company!"

            "review": "Great trip with Brother Rachid. After deciding on Morocco for our honeymoon, we knew we wanted someone to take us around the city of Marrakech and the countryside of Morocco. Reading the reviews on TripAdvisors, we found nothing but great reviews on Discover Morocco Day Tours and a guide named Rachid. I had emailed many different tour groups in Morocco and Rachid was the first to get back to me. Not only the first time, but ever time we emailed him with any questions, he would get right back to us without hesitation. I found that very comforting in a tour guide. From the day we got there, Rachid was waiting for us at the airport with a sign that had our name on it. He gathered our bags and we were off. From the moment we met him, we knew that we were in good hands. After a brief ride through the city, we arrived at the Souks where our Riad was located. Instead of dropping us off to find our way, Rachid walked us through the labyrinth of Marrakech markets to our hotel. On our walk, we mentioned that we wanted someone to take us through the Souks and he said that he would take care of it. Sure enough, the next morning we had a lovely gentleman named Mohammad waiting for us at our hotel to tour us through the Souks. It was an extra charge for the tour through the souks but well worth it. Mohammad spoke perfect english and was very informative as we toured.The next day, Rachid arrived promptly to our Riad at 7:20am for our Sahara Desert adventure. We jumped in the very clean and comfortable LandCruiser and were off! The journey to the Sahara was a long ride (about 8-10 hours) but the scenery was breathtaking. We drove over mountains that could rival the Colorado Rockies and next to cliffs that resembled the Grand Canyon. We stopped plenty of times for bathroom breaks and places that Rachid thought we would find interesting. We also stopped for a delicious lunch that was included in our package. Finally we arrived at the Sahara Desert (make sure you have plenty of water!) and our next mode of transportation, camels! Rachid and the driver let us out and we were then led by the Berber people on camel back to our camp site. Rachid and the driver drove themselves and all of our luggage in the car to the campsite. That was very nice because our other camp mates had to carry their own. The camel ride was about one hour through scrub and up and down sand dunes. It was beautiful and so much fun.After a lovely night sleeping under the stars (we pulled the beds out of the tent), we had an early start back in the car with Rachid and the driver. We skipped the camel ride back to the town and just got back in the car. Rachid had even more points of interest to show us on the drive back. We stopped at Ait Ben Addouh and took a great tour of the Kasbah, dozed off and on in the car and before your knew it, we were back in Marrakech. Rachid dropped us off at our next hotel, we said our goodbyes. It was hard to part ways after such a great couple of days! There is nothing better than taking a shower after a night in the desert. Once we had rinsed off at the hotel, we had to begin to make plans to get to the airport a couple days later. Our hotel was going to charge us 30 Euros for 5 minute ride to the airport. Obviously we did not want to pay that so I emailed Rachid to ask him what we should pay a taxi driver to get to the airport. Of course he got right back to us and said that he would send a driver and not to worry about what it costs. It was such a kind gesture to take of us like that. We did tip the driver but it did not seem necessary.All in all, Rachid literally was like a guardian watching over us the whole time we were in Morocco. He treated us like family. Even though we always felt safe, it was nice to have Brother Rachid looking out for us in such a foreign country. He said that once you do a trip to the desert, you are now family and that is why he will always be Brother Rachid to us. We highly recommend booking any tour with Rachid. He will exceed your expectations and made our trip to Morocco an incredible, once in a lifetime experience!"

From before our departure Rachid's quick response filled us with confidence and we were not disappointed. He arranged a flexible package with day 1, being a tour of the Medina, Souks and other local sights. Our guide Hafid, was knowledgeable and keen to provide us with the history of Marrakech. As 4 females, we felt safe and confident walking around the Souks, seeing the day come to life - most fascinating. We also took in the Majorelle Gardens (Yves San Laurent's), a much welcome oasis amongst the heat and speed of pace in the Medina. Our second day, was a trip out through the Atlas Mountains to Ait benhaddou. With Rachid as our guide, we were well looked after with plenty of water, photography stops and local information (and much laughter!) We spent time at the Kasbar (walking shoes essential), with amazing views across the desert land and mountains. We also had the privilege of finding more out about the Berner culture from our guide. We really would recommend Discover Morocco-tours to anyone visiting this beautiful country. Thank you again Rachid for taking such good care of us, Gemma, Tristen, Sara and Lisa :-) x"

We met some people in our Riad who had booked this tour (two nights and a camel trek into the Sahara), and the day before they were set to leave, I phoned Rachid and asked him if we could come along. They managed to fit us in with no trouble whatsoever, much to our delight! Our guide for the trip was actually Kamal who was absolutely brilliant. As other people have said, nothing was too much trouble and we were able to stop whenever and wherever we wanted to. During our trip we stopped at a Kasbah which we were guided around (for an extra 15 dirham, I think). It was actually a very interesting visit with panoramic views of the surrounding landscape and a beautiful little town to look and shop around. After our visit to the Kasbah we went to a restaurant and were able to have a swim in the pool - a very needed cool off. Later that day we visited the Dades Gorge where we stayed the night in a nice hotel that was very welcome after a long day's drive. We had tagine for dinner and were then seranaded by a group of drummers which was really fun! The next day we drove down to the Sahara and, after our drive, went for a swim in a hotel swimming pool before our trek into the desert. We got onto camels and trekked into the desert where we stayed in a very authentic camp (although thankfully it had beds!). Overall we had a fantastic experience and, as one of the cheapest tours offered around Marrakech, it was certainly worth the money we paid for it. Kamal was the perfect guide and although he drove us over 400 miles, remained 100% happy and helpful. He also navigated the bends of the Atlas mountains expertly! I would definitely recommend this tour company and would use them again if I were to return to Morocco. Thanks Kamal and Rachid from Rachel and Zanny"

The half-hour camel ride was just long enough for us to experience a ride on a dromedary. We also stopped at a Berber village where Rachid explained the traditions and culture of these amazing people. Afterwards we were served mint tea and bread for dipping into olive oil or honey. The trek up to the waterfall was a little gruelling in the heat but well worth it, and afterwards we were able to relax over a delicious lunch by the river. The whole day was thoroughly enjoyable and well worth the money - Rachid and Amanar were two genuinely friendly guys who went out of their way to make it a memorable day for us.

They gave me the info and I rang Rachid who put us straight on the tour for the next day! We went on the 2night/3 day Marrakech to Merzouga trip that included an overnight stay in another Riad in the Dades gorge and an overnight stay in the desert. Everything about this trip was perfect. Our guide, Kamal was extremely helpful, happy and friendly. He also turned out to be a pretty good driver as he navigated his way around lorries on the mountain roads and kept us all safe in the car! We travelled in a 4x4 as there were only 6 of us on the trip which also meant that we could drive across a river and up to a few view points to get some good photos. The Riad was also good. The only thing I could say that was bad about it was that we had no hot water in our room but the staff were very friendly and we were serenaded after dinner by some Berber boys playing the drums. We then travelled towards the desert and got to have a swim in a pool before getting on our camels to ride into the desert at sunset. The Berber camp that we went to was great: friendly men and a fun camel ride with great pictures. We also had a good tagine and couscous dinner. We then travelled back to Marrakech the next day which was a long drive (10ish hours) but Kamal stopped enough times along the way to have breaks etc. I would recommend this tour to anyone and after doing some research into it, it looks like it's a pretty good price (120\u20ac) each. Kamal was a great guide and the company was very trustworthy. We had a great time and it really made our trip to morocco a bit more special."

            "review": "Marrakech & Merzouga Desert. This was our first visit to Morocco and Discover Morocco Tours made it such a memorable trip. We had only a few days and wanted to see as much as possible. Rachid put together an itinerary and made sure that every last detail was taken care of for us. MARRAKECH:We flew into Marrakech and Rachid was at the airport waiting with transportation to our riad (primary form of accommodation: equivalent to a b&b or guest house). We stayed in the heart of the medina (which was amazing) but vehicles can only take you so far. When we reached the gates Rachid had arranged for someone to meet us with a hand-pulled cart for our luggage. We were very grateful for this as it was still a good 10 minute walk through the narrow busy streets/alleyways of the medina to reach our riad. He gave us a little time to settle into our accommodation then arranged for an orientation city tour of Marrakech with a local guide who specialized in Marrakech walking tours. This was a good way to start the trip. We were able to see the different areas of the city, visit the palace, learn some history, see some of the local handcrafts in progress and shop in the market. If we hadn't taken this tour we would most likely not have ventured outside the medina on our own so it was great to see a little more of the city. Our time in Marrakech was amazing but the primary reason we chose Discover Morocco Tours was to see more of Morocco and visit the desert. Rachid met us at our riad early in the morning and off we went on our road trip! He had arranged a driver with a spacious van. We left Marrakech and began our adventure over the Atlas mountains into the desert.ROAD TRIP ACROSS MOROCCO:We chose the Merzouga desert trip because of the red sand. This was the Sahara we had always pictured. The Merzouga desert is almost twice the distance from Marrakech compared to the Zagora desert (the other option with white sand / smaller dunes). So the itinerary we were interested in is usually a long excursion. That said, we only had a few days in Morocco. Rachid was amazing and worked with us to put together an excursion that would allow us to visit Merzouga in our timeframe and budget. The downside would be a lot of traveling in a short time (hundreds of miles in a matter of days) but we were prepared to deal with that and Rachid did his best to break it up for us. Considering how far we had to go we still saw so much! It's incredible how different the mountains, villages and deserts are from the Morocco we experienced in Marrakech. The stops that Rachid chose gave an incredible taste of the country. It was a really good balance of known attractions and \"real Morocco\". At most of the stops Rachid accompanied us as the guide but for some sites he arranged a local guide to take us around. These local guides rely on tour companies to bring visitors to see their villages so we were happy to learn from the locals.DESERT CAMPING:It took two days to get to the red desert. Rachid arranged accommodation at a hotel just outside the Dades Gorges for us the first night (which was excellent). When we reached Merzouga the next day we established base at a desert hotel. The camels and desert camping excursions are all associated with hotels just outside the dunes so that there is a place for the drivers to stay while visitors are in the desert. This arrangement also permits visitors to lock up their belongings and allows use of the facilities (showers) when visitors return which we were very grateful for. Merzouga is actually the name of the town where these hotels that offer desert excursions are located. The dunes themselves are called Erg Chebbi. The desert was worth every second spent on the road to get there. We were met at the hotel by one of the Berbers from the camp. He had a camel for each of us and led us over the dunes into the Sahara. About an hour into the camel trek we stopped to watch the sunset. We were already deep enough into the desert that nothing but dunes could be seen whichever direction you looked and the sun hitting the red sand is like nothing I could ever describe. I can't imagine anything in our lifetime will compare to the half hour spent on top of that dune. Ever.When we were ready we continued our trek into the desert. It was another hour before we reached camp but when you are on a camel trek in the Sahara you take in every minute. The sky was so clear that the moon and the stars provided plenty of light. In fact when we reached camp we spent the first half hour laying in the dunes watching shooting stars.Dinner was delicious. Typical Moroccan tagine: bread, meat, potatoes and vegetables with fruit for dessert. After dinner a campfire was built. There were five other groups from all over staying at the camp so we all tried to introduce ourselves. Then the berber men joined the campfire and performed traditional berber music for about an hour. They got us up dancing and even passed their instruments around for everyone to try. It was fantastic.We did not know what to expect from the camping experience but it was very enjoyable. Sleeping tents were all together and faced inward to a communal area. We had our own tent complete with cots dressed in blankets and pillows. Dinner was served in a large tent at the front of camp decorated in beautiful moroccan textiles with tables and chairs. And there were outhouse-style toilets just outside the tents. It definitely exceeded our expectations.On the morning we left our camels were waiting for us outside of camp. I will admit that this second camel ride was felt far more than our first. Despite the padding from the blankets on the harness, riding camels will leave it's mark on your inner thighs. But despite a little discomfort the views of the Sahara were no less spectacular on the way out.Because of our limited timeframe we had to head directly back to Marrakech from Merzouga. It was a long drive (12+hrs) but the views along the way were incredible. When we arrived Rachid walked with us to our riad, making sure we found it in the dark. The following morning he met us for breakfast where we marked our travels on a map bought in the market and he arranged transport back to the airport in time for our flight. Rachid walked with us all the way to the check-in desk. By this time we were saying goodbye to a friend, not just our guide. You will not get an experience like this with any old tour company.If we are fortunate enough to return to Morocco in the near future we wouldn't think twice before booking with Discover Morocco Tours again. We had such a fantastic experience. Thank you Rachid!!!"

First we went to a traditional Berber house - had a lovely breakfast and saw how to make mint tea. Then we stopped for a camel ride which was good fun. We then stopped off to see how Argan oil is made which was very interesting and a chance to purchase some products. We then hiked for an hour and a half in Ourkia valley to a wonderful waterfall (this was tough work in the heat but well worth it!). The day finished with a great lunch by the river. Our driver and tour guide were very kind and helpful - they also played some great music on the drive between stops! We very much enjoyed the day and highly recommend this tour company."

We were picked up from our hotel and dropped to the airport on time, we even got the itinerary amended so we could get back in time! Stayed at great little places along the route, not over crowded tourist places and got to a real feel for what Morocco is like outside if the major cities. Also the group size was 4 people so we could ask loads of questions and stop whenever we wanted. 100% would go with these guys again if i went back to morocco! Thanks Rachid :)"

My friends and I went on this tour for 6 days and had such a unique experience that became more of a local's perspective of life, instead of the tourist-infested scenes that most people see when they go to Morocco.Our driver and guide, Abdul, had a great sense of humor and knew everyone in every place that we went to. Because of this, we were able to have some truly authentic experiences...Our riads were amazing, the meals delicious, and the life fascinating. We began in the Atlas Mountains and the Oasis... parts of Morocco that I had no idea existed. The natural side of Moroccco along with the Berber culture was an experience to behold.We also had the privilege of staying in a desert camp in the Sahara!The people everywhere were so kind and hospitable.We also saw Fez and Marrakech and by the end of the tour had become great friends with both Abdul and Rachid.Thank you both for everything!!!! :)~ The Americans ~"

I went to Marrakech with 2 friends, at first we weren't sure if we wanted to visit the desert, partly because the drive was so long and many of the tours were really expensive. Luckily my friend found out about Discover Morocco Tours. We booked through email and Rachid was really patient and informative to respond to all our questions. They even arranged a driver to pick us up at the airport. The 2 day trip to Zagoura Desert was definitely the best part of our trip. We stop every hour or so to take pictures of the gorgeous scenery and to stretch our legs. We even visited the Berber villages where many movies were shot. This made the 8 hr drive pass by in a blink. When we arrived at the desert we rode camels to the camp which was another exciting experience. We were expecting to have to sleep in sleeping bags in the tent, but the camp was a lot better than what we were expecting with electricity and actual beds! Looking at the stars in the middle of the desert was another unforgettable experience. We woke up early to see the sunrise in the desert the next morning and they served nice coffee, mint tea and bread for breakfast. The drive back to Marrakech was comfortable with the friendly driver and Rachid who is very genuine, helpful and made us feel very welcomed. I would definitely recommend Discover Morocco tours and hope to go back and see more of Morocco!"

Then it was the camel rides, star gazing, Berber dinner and breakfast, seeing the sunrise. It was such an unforgettable experience.Rachid is such a genuine, funny, and friendly person who would put us first and let us decide where we want to go/not go. Even as we headed back to Marrakesh, he went out of his way to drop one of our friends to 1 location and rest of us back to our hotel. I highly recommend Discover Morocco Day Tours.

Their prices are also very good as compared to other agencies we sought quotes from. I can attest to the character of Rachid, who was our guide and also happens to be the owner of Discover Morocco Tours.During our time in Morocco, Rachid treated us like family and went out of his way to make our trip as pleasant as possible. Rachid is someone who will regard the well being of his guests as more important than his own. He is experienced, knowledgeable and passionate about Morocco. I would recommend anyone to have Rachid as a guide when visiting Morocco. He is someone you can trust and count on.Yangyu(From Singapore, Visited 27-29 March 2014)"

The Trip started with Rachid (our host) and Abdul (our driver) coming to our Riad (Matham) to pick us up, so we wouldn't get lost trying to find them. The kindness didn't stop there, throughout the two days with Rachid and Abdul both went out of their way to make our trip great even when they didn't have to. From little gestures such as buying us Moroccan sweets we had never tried before, to bigger such as secretly getting a birthday cake for my dads birthday with his name written on it - and getting the whole camp to sing happy birthday. He was touched by Rachid's kindness and I was grateful for the gesture. As for the trip itself, we made lots of stops at interesting places which I won't go into, but as a photographer, they were all awesome.We took a camel ride (my first experience of this) through the Zogora desert at sunset which was beautiful, then stayed over night in a tent which was a massive surprise - It wasn't cold, wasn't cover in desert bugs, and was actually quite comfortable. Food was also provided at night and in the morning. Was a lot of fun!I recommend this to anyone, even people who aren't so 'outdoorsy'. Thanks Rachid for a great trip."

I have just returned from a week long trip to Marrakech for my honeymoon with my wife and chose discover Morocco tours after wading through various options on trip advisor. I wasn't disappointed. I was in contact with Rachid before the honeymoon and he was extremely helpful and patient in asking my numerous questions (I wanted to get it right!) and so that filled me with confidence before getting out there. We chose the 2 day trips to the Ozud waterfalls and the 3 valleys and they were really worth it, we both thoroughly enjoyed the trips and gave us a good flavour of Morocco life. What particularly struck us about Rachid and our driver Abdul was how professional and knowledgeable they were but also so down to earth, friendly and good fun they were too, and they seemed to get the balance perfectly. We liked how they were leaving us to chat and be by ourselves for a lot of the time too - they weren't in our faces all the time, like I guess some tour guides might be, and we appreciated that. Rachid was flexible too when we decided to change one of our trips and we thought this might be a problem but he was fine with it. What was also good was how it really felt like we were incontrol and he accommodated us so well - from giving us a chance to stop and take pics etc whenever we wanted to picking us up bang on time at our Riad and giving us lots of helpful info about life in Marrakech. 2 things that also impressed me about this compared with other options were that Rachid picked us up and took us back to the airport as part of the package, and the money for the day trips was for everything - lunch and drinks included, so we didn't have to worry about anything.All in all a brilliant time with Rachid and Abdul who felt more like friends than guides by the end of the week. We are keen to return one day."

Hussein was absolutely flexible planning the trekking routes fitting to our expectations, our fitness level and the rapidly changing weather.Overall an experience we would absolutely recommend and a company we will contact first when planning another trip to Marocco!"

Firstly I booked our over night stay in the desert a few months ago and Rachid was prompt to respond and very informative. We were picked up from the airport by Amanar on time and I explained that we needed to change our money as I did not want to do it at the airport, he took us straight to a bureau in the town which was a great help. We then met Rachid and he showed us to our Riad I had booked. Rachid provided us with a map and his telephone number and some really good tips for our stay. The following morning Amanar took us on our overnight trip to the desert and we had a great time, he went above and beyond, he has a great sense of humour and was very knowledgeable. On the 2nd day he found us a donkey to have pictures with as I had mentioned it the day before. We stopped at many stalls/shops on the way through the mountains and he was patient whilst us girls shopped! Finally both Amanar and Rachid met us on our last day to get us back to the airport. I know I have waffled on but these guys are brilliant, I cannot fault them in any way and I highly recommend them. We had a great time and have returned home with some lovely memories."

Rachid answered very promptly and was more than willing to tailor the trip to our needs. I booked two trips (12th/13th Feb 2014). One was a day tour around Marrakech and the main attractions and souks. This was by a local guide and not Rachid. This really gave me and my husband a real life in sight into the medina. This was a trip by foot and we saw many famous sights and also went deep into hidden souks. On the second day we had arranged a trip to the Atlas Mountains/three valleys. The day started at 7.50am. We were with Rachid and his friend Abdul. We travelled first to have camel ride. We then went to eat breakfast in a Berber house where we were really looked after and had fresh home made traditional food. We then stopped at various places on our journey to see beautiful picturesque views. The next stop was a mountain bike ride. Me and my husband have never laughed so much. We are slim but unfit and in our late 20's and attempting to do a mountain bike ride! Although physically difficult for us (we also wore jeans and it was really hot!) the views and experience was incredible. After this we needed some much needed lunch! Rachid and Abdul treated us to some traditional street food which was gorgeous - think of a spiced barbecued burger. The day did not end here. We then went on to finish the day quad biking! This was fantastic. The views were stunning and Rachid really knew the best spots! We were back to our hotel by 5.15pm despite such a busy day.Throughout the day Rachid and Abdul were always joking with us and answered any questions. We spoke about the Moroccan culture, politics and religion. No question was left unanswered. They were open minded and like they both said they treat you like family! Would definitely recommend Rachid and his company. I will never forget these memories!"

My husband, son and I went with Rachid and Abdul to Zagora, which is an overnight desert trip, to celebrate my husbands birthday.

They were very informative about the Berber culture and stopped several times allowing us to take photos. Rachid surprised us many times with acts of kindness and they both helped to make sure that my husband had the best birthday ever. I think the only part of the trip that we didn't particularly enjoy was the trip to the rug shop, but apart from that, it was an experience we will never forget.

The tour finishes early afternoon. The second tour was the Ait benhaddou/Ouarzazate/Atlas mountain trip. A long day from 8am to 9pm, but what a day. Rachid and his outstanding driver took us not only to the highlights of this special tour, but also took time to do some extras (taking a more scenic route there, doing a great 4x4 \"race\" across the desert towards Ouarzazate, etc.). I would HIGHLY recommend this day out with Rachid. The 3rd tour was the Ourika Valley trip, which was pretty good, particularly the last climb from the first waterfall up. Overall we really like Rachid. He is clearly proud of his tradition and country, and we got a small taste of this beautiful place with his warm hospitality and engaging character!

The carriage part of the tour was not that long though. Most of the time we found our selves walking, including almost two hours in the souks. We also found it a bit peculiar that a so called full day tour ended after just four and a half hours. This was by no means a bad tour. The guide was good and we saw and learned a lot. We had just expected a little more..."

He was very friendly and answered all our questions about Morocco and the Berber culture. 10 days later we meet him by accident again in Essouira and he invited us to have some lovely fish with him for lunch. It was extremely awesome.I hope we stay in touch. I can definetely recommend everybody to book any tour with Rachid and enjoy Morocco with him."

Though Rachid was not able to make it the first 2 days of the trip, he legt us in the good hands of his best friend Hassan. The trip was amazing, we went through Ait Ben Haddou Kasbah, Ouarzazate, Todgha to the Todra Gorge, Tinjdad and finally to Merzouga. The landscape changed every 20 minuten, and so did the colors. The hotel was good, and the nomad camp was even better. Great camel ride watching the sunset and sunrise, lovely food, nice berber music and the sky full of stars was amazing! The last day Rachid joined us and guided us back to Marrakech. He was great company, and offered to help us at any time, apart from the desert trip. We really felt comfortable with this tour agency and its guides, they really love their work and know a lot about the Morrocan culture and sites. We would definitely book this tour or another tour at this agency again!"

I had seen some very good reviews of Rachid on the internet and I was not disappointed to have booked with him!! He took my girlfriend and me on an excursion to Ait Benhaddou and made it the experience of a lifetime!Rachid is very knowledgeable, friendly and funny! From the start of the day until we returned to Marrakech, he made it a fun, exciting and interesting day. He gave us lots of information about the Berber culture, Moroccan history and the sights we were seeing; he answered all of our questions and was an endless source of knowledge.We stopped at many places on our journey through the Atlas mountains: for a Berber breakfast (which was included in the price of the tour), to see some amazing and interesting settlements and views, at a place where they made argan oil (a lady there gave us a short tour and explained how they produced the various oils used for cosmetics and eating), to stop for coffee breaks, and at a number of Berber stalls selling souvenirs and the likes.The driver was very safe and experienced but managed to take make the journey quick and pleasant. His car was very comfortable with air conditioning; Rachid chatted with us throughout the journey and even played Berber music for us on the car stereo!When we reached Ait Benhaddou we stopped for a delicious lunch (also included) and enjoyed views of the Kasbah before proceeding to see it up close. Rachid showed me how to tie a Berber style turban (I think it is called a Shesh or Chan) which helped protect me from the bright sun. He let us take our time and stop to look at things that we took interest in, he never rushed us.I cannot explain what a great man Rachid is, he is very down to earth and has an amazing outlook on life! He told us of some of his life experiences, some of which are very moving. He is a Berber himself and knew most of the people we met along our journey. He explained that some guides are in cahoots with the traders and will take tourists to places that overcharge you and give commission back to the guide. He doesn't take any commission from any of the traders and even told us which places were overcharging customers and not to buy anything from them.If you get a chance to take an excursion with Rachid then you simply must do it! You will not regret it!! If I am able to go back in Marrakech again then I will definitely go on an excursion to the dessert with Rachid as I would love to spend a night or two trekking through the dunes and seeing the stars!Thank you Rachid, this was the highlight of our holiday!"

We booked this trip with complete ease - we contacted Rachid the evening before the trip and had a reply within hours confirming that we would be able to travel the next day, which we didnt expect. We initially chose Rachid due to the great price that was offered, and we weren't disappointed. We were picked up from our Riad on time by our friendly, English-speaking guide and taken to Rachid's comfortable mini-van with seatbelts and air conditioning. We then proceeded to drive out of Marrakech with our guide explaining a few things about the Berbers and Morocco. He was polite and friendly and Rachid drives very well and is very careful. The hour and a half journey is split well, meaning we weren't in the minivan for the full time before we were seeing our attractions.Our first stop consisted of visiting a traditional Berber family home, where we were provided with a tour as well as a delicious breakfast made by the family themselves. Although there were other tourists there, it did not seem overcrowded or make much of a difference. The people and the sights from the house were wonderful.Following our stop here, we continued ahead to our camel ride, which was a little shorter than stated on the website, but not by much. We were still pleased with the amount of riding we got to do, with beautiful views either side. We also stopped at a small place where Argan Oil is produced and sold, with an English speaking lady who provided all the information we needed.Our final stop was in the Ourika Valley itself, where we walked to the waterfalls. It was quite a journey, which took around 50 minutes each way but the sights were excellent and we felt well looked after by our guide who was friendly and chatty throughout. We seemed to pass the touristy waterfall and headed to another one which was more secluded and private, which was great. After we had walked back down we were provided with a delicious free three course lunch, where we only had to pay for our own drinks and a tip.This concluded our trip and we were escorted back to our Riad by Rachid and our guide. The drive back was pleasant and a well deserved sit down!"

A very smart & passionate but very honourable man, well loved by all and who will give you his last shirt if you needed it. He knows and lived a vast amount of the Berber country and endeavours to inform you with all he knows. You will soon learn just how much Rachid feels for and dedicates to the people of his part of the world. Most of all it's fair to say, you will also learn Rachid is really not interested in making commissions or great profits as he'll purposely steer you away from dodgy sellers and overpriced restaurants - don't just take my word for it, use your own judgement here.The tour itself covered great distance and many cultures that you travelled to Morocco to see. This was easily the highlight of the trip and you won't want to go back to the bigger cities after you've travelled outside of these limited traveller vacuums! - Thanks again Rachid!"

As for the price, I was shocked at how much was included in the trip! All meals, a boat trip to the waterfalls, all petrol, the list was endless!

We rode camels through the desert at sunset which was a fantastic experience. We then sat drinking mint tea and watched for shooting stars, before dinner and music around the camp fire.

It was hands-down our best decision during our entire stay in Marrakesh. During our trip we visited the Merzouga Desert and had an amazing sunset camel ride through the red sands and giant dunes. We got to stay with a berber camp and look at the stars, which are simply stunning in the Sahara Desert. Our trip was lead by the owner of the company Rachid, and he was an amazing guide. In my previous trip to Morocco (a couple of years back) my guide simply pointed out landscapes without much explanation but during this trip we were very lucky to have Rachid, who is very knowledgeable and made an effort to tell us about the history and culture of the places we were visiting. Rachid made everything in our trip run smoothly and he even made a point to help us with other logistics of our trip after the excursion was over. Rachid and Discover Morocco helped make our trip a wonderful and memorable experience and I recommend Discover Morocco to anyone planning a trip to Marrakesh. I also recommend taking time to visit the Merzouga Desert which is the desert you see in photographs of the Sahara (orange sand, large sand dunes). During my previous trip I visited the Zagoura Desert which was still a great trip though not quite as gorgeous and memorable as the Merzouga. Thanks so much Rachid for an amazing trip and experience!! -Ana from California"

Thank you Rishard(tour guide) for one incredible experience that I will never forget."

We were very unsure if we wanted to spend the time and money on a guide and excursion - but we decided to give Rachid a try and so booked a tour to the Atlas Mountains (see a Berber house, have tea and breakfast with Berber family, hike to waterfalls, camel ride, lunch, etc.) - and we were not disappointed. We found Rachid to be warm, friendly, easy to talk too and very responsive to our emails and questions; plus he and his assistants were punctual (which clients always appreciate). He was flexible enough to work with us so as to deviate a bit from the norm and include a trip to an authentic Berber market - which we found facinating. Unfortuanlty, Rachid could not be with us all day but his partner was just a professional and knowlegable. All-in-all a great day. We would definately recommend his service and if we go back, use him again. Thanks Rachid,"

At a traditional berber house we could join a traditional tea-ceremony and were offered a berber breakfast, which we enjoyed very much. The hiking in this beautiful landscape was well guided by our companion Rashid who could provide a lot of inside knowledge about the region, the culture and the people living there. It was a wonderful trip and we had a lot of fun and remeberable moments!"

I did the 3 day, 2 night excursion to the Merzouga Desert (has beautiful red sand, large dunes) and it's for sure one of the best trips I've ever been on. There was suppose to be another group joining the tour but they cancelled last minute and instead of cancelling the tour altogether, our guide Rachid still did it (for the same price) but with just me and my two friends. He always went out of his way to accommodate our needs and made sure we were always comfortable throughout our trip. Rachid, along with the driver who were both very considerate and always had our best interest at heart, made us feel more like family than just another regular tour group. Rachid was very knowledgeable in Berber culture and Morocco's history, and we were able to see everything from the Kasbah to the gorges and the Atlas Mountains. The camel ride to the Merzouga desert was incredible, you start right before sunset (and get to stop while the sun's setting to take some epic photos) and the return ride is right before sunrise. We had a hilarious nomad guide that led our camels to the campsite and when we arrived we were served a nice traditional dinner along with live music and dancing. On the way back we were able to shower and change at a hotel so the overall trip is well thought out and very accommodating. Rachid is hands down the best guide you could ask for, so I strongly recommend this tour (he is the owner) as well as doing the 3 day, 2 night excursion to get to the Merzouga Desert (it's worth the extra day!!) This is definitely going down as one of my most memorable experiences. Thanks Rachid!! -Natasha, USA"

Rachid really made us feel like family, he is a really easy going and cool guy and he told us about life and people in Morocco first hand and showed us some really spectacular sites and places. If you like photography as I do, you will love it! The highlight of our trip was meeting a traditional berber people and having a cup of tea with them and of course a camel ride to the desert. We really couldn't be happier about this trip, and it is really cheap for what you get! I highly recommend this to anyone. You do spend a lot of time driving, but it is definitely worth it!

The trip we took was only a day trip and it was the perfect amount of time and activities. The tour was private and well priced and most of all we felt completely at ease and safe with Rishard and the driver. He was also helpful outside of the tour and readily available for any questions.

Firstly we would like to thank Rachid and his colleague, a very responsible and smart driver, for everything they did on the trip.Before coming to Marrakech, we contacted like 20 different travel agencies with the same quote: 3 days, 2 nights in Merzouga (Erg Chebbi sand dunes). Rachid (Discover Morocco Tours) gave us an offer we couldn't resist: the price was really good, the tour was private (for 4 people), we didn't have to worry about anything apart from memorizing all that interesting information our guide was giving us. I have to point out the fact that everything was included in the price (a night in a hotel, three meals per day, a camel ride, night in a tent in nomad's camp). Because most agencies only include one or two meals. You can get a better price from other tour agencies if you join a shared tour with many people. But in this case you will not get a guide (only a driver) and no freedom at all. And we could freely ask to stop and have a short break in some scenic areas on the way to the desert, we could ask about anything and Rachid would answer as he's very knowledgeable and attentive.Thank you and hope to meet you again!Lithuanians:)"

From here began an over 12hour unforgettable tour through the Atlas mountains and to several very ingesting sites. Rachid was always very caring for our wellbeing and safety and gave us lots of background information about the sites we visited. What we particularly liked about the trip is that we were not driven to any of the typical tourist sales places but only visited very interesting sites. We were really amazed by the trip and would have loved to book more troops with him but unfortunately had no more time. I would recommend touring with Rachid to anyone looking for a great informative trip without having to stand thtough the typical sales auctions."

Not only did he give us history of the Berber people, he also shared with us personal stories and experiences to help us better understand the variety of cultures in Morocco. I will absolutely never forget the day trip we spent with Rishard. He helped us hiking up the mountain, holding our bags and cameras whenever we needed. Our day trip with Rishard included everything from Berber breakfast and tea, camel rides, Moroccan oil/spice tour, a hike up the mountain to the second highest waterfall in Morocco, and an excellent Moroccan dinner. All of above plus transportation were included in one great price. Rishard alone as a tour guide was the biggest bonus of this trip, we had an unforgettable time!"

Our moms were all having panic attacks that four 20 year old girls were traveling alone in Morocco. It was by chance that we ended up with Rishard on our second day, but I am so grateful that we did. He exceeds all of the duties of a tour guide. Not only did he give us a history lesson of the Berber people, he also shared personal experiences and explained how Morocco is a cross section of cultures. Rishard became an instant friend and spent the day laughing with us-- he also held our purses and cameras for us, along with taking photographs of us on our cameras to document the day. I soon as I arrived home I emailed my mom everything that we had done and learned that day. She replied: \"In the end I'm glad that you went to Morocco and I'm glad you did it the way you did-- you will remember [Rishard for] your whole life.\" She is right. Here is a summary of my favorite day in Morocco:(he picks you up at your hostel/hotel)Stop One: Berber House- tour of a traditional Berber house (mini history lesson by Rishard)- Berber breakfast (included in the price and possibly the best bread of my entire life!)- lesson on how to make Moroccan mint tea (and a few cups of course)Stop Two: Camel Ride- everyone needs to ride a camel when in MoroccoStop Three: Moroccan Oil/Spice Tour- tour and lesson in the garden about all of the native plants in Morocco- demonstration on how Moroccan Oil is made (you can even help the ladies make some)- lesson on how all the plants are turned into beauty, medicinal and edible products- drink the best cup of tea of your entire lifeStop Four: Waterfall Hike- farther in the mountains there is a hike up to the waterfalls- if you aren't an avid hiker Rishard will hold your hand and lift you up over the rocks so that you make it to the waterfall safelyStop Five: Lunch by the River(included in the price)- three course meal that is delicious**I never had a bad meal in Morocco but this was definitely a really good oneEverything was included in the initial price, which for all the services is an amazing bargain."

He has had experience managing a hotel and it shows because he is very professional. He has been brought up on a strong set of Berber ethics and seems to be reluctant to charge for his service!

Rachid will quickly become your friend rather than a guide. I am particularly grateful for him getting my bag back after leaving it on the wrong bus!Other tour guides will take you to shops where you will be pressured to buy stuff but Rachid isn't interested in commission. Instead he uses his network to get you the best price. All the restaurants or cafes were good quality and Rachid will pay for it for you which makes things a lot easier. He is quick to buy you drinks even if you don't really want one! But it is all included. The best value though is Rachids time.

Right away, Rachid calmed our worries about the hectic and unfamiliar city, and sat down with us to show us on a map where we were and how to get to key attractions such as Djemaa el Fna and the souks. He even lent us his cell phone so that we could call for help if we got lost! That really impressed us, since he showed such great trust and hospitality before even getting to know us. Later on in the trip, my fiance got kind of sick (probably from some bad food at the food stalls). My fiance didn't feel up to trying to find food ourselves while he was sick, and we didn't have a lot of money, so we talked to Rachid and Rachid took us to a reliable, clean little local restaurant (not catering to tourists). Rachid helped us order and buy some roast chicken with bread and veggies. Nothing fancy, but very solid and we knew we could trust its cleanliness and quality because of Rachid. Overall, Rachid is extremely friendly, personable, considerate, knowledgeable, and helpful for anything you might need. He speaks good English, and you will not regret taking a tour with him.

Rishard set up and took me and 2 friends on this awesome trip to check out waterfalls and some of the beautiful wilderness in the interior of morocco. We had a private car pick us up at the hotel and drive us a couple hours. Just the car ride alone was great since Rishard is the man and made the trip feel like 2 minutes. Hes the nicest guy. After we did some hiking and saw the waterfalls, we had a beautiful authentic moroccan tajin lunch with monkeys running around the all-outdoors restaurant and the waterfalls as our view. This could have been the highlight of the trip since we were all just chilling enjoying the food, friends, and scenery. Life doesnt get better. Anyways, we did some more hiking and sight seeing and loved it all. We also took a 30 minute rafting adventure down one of the rivers which was chill. Overall, i'd recommend doing this trip again, but make sure you do it with Rishard. He made the trip go smoothly & memorably."

Rachid was our guide - you could not ask for a friendlier, more knowledgeable, more accommodating person.We visited a Berber family on the way there and enjoyed breakfast and tea with them. Climbed up into the mountains a bit to visit a beautiful waterfall and see some sites, then back down again stopping for lunch. It is a day well spent, I highly recommend it!"

Both in Marrakesh and on our day trip to the mountains he was a friend as well as a guide and truly made it a great experience. The trip to the Atlas mountains was a great break from the city and was not too far a ride or too difficult a hike. The waterfall at the top was very nice and the air is so much cleaner and cooler up there. I was definitely glad that I chose to take this trip."

What made the tour even more special was the fact that Rachid was with us- he was such a fun host to be with, and very helpful too! We learned alot from him during the trip... Starting at Marrakech going through the winding roads in Atlas mountains, with breath taking views, and getting to see famous sites such as Ait ben Haddou...We then stopped over for a night..waking up to mountain fresh air!... then into the Ouarzazate desert, where we were entertained by the friendly Berbers which was a great laugh! Berber omelette is yumm by the way!All in all this was a great experience which allowed us to take in the beautiful Culture!Highly reccommend as Rachid will take good care of you :)Thanks again Rachid - we hope to see you again!!!Humaira & Jenni"

We met lovely local people and had unique experiences, if you only do one visit, this is the one. The other memorable day was to Essaouri ,it is a contrast to Marrakech ! A relaxed chilled day at the coast with great food and no hustle and bustle. In all we found Zouhir honest, informative, entertaining and did not allow us to waste our time by taking us to 'sales traps'. We heard of him when he operated as jet go tours but are glad we waited for his new website go4 Marrakech private tours to be set up as my husband and I had a fantastic time."

We booked this tour after a friend's recommendation and I would like to recommend Zouhair and his tours to anyone who wants to make a Sahara trip. Morocco trip was a family holiday and Zouhair is more like a family member than a tour guide. He is very thoughtful and patient, never rushed us at any interesting place and let us enjoy the views and sites as much as we can. He arranged a very nice hotel, Chez Pierre at Dades Gorge and also arranged a very nice suite for my family. The suite has a private terrace where we enjoyed the starry night of the gorge. Dinner at Chez Pierre has five courses with candles, it was fantastic! At the desert, he arranged two luxury Berber tents, with the best Tagine we had in Morocco. We had our dinner under the starry sky with candles. The starry night in Sahara is definitely breathtaking! We rode camels to the camping site but the next morning we didn't want to ride camels anymore, Zouhair arranged a 4X4 to pick us out of the desert, and also we enjoyed dune bashing. This tour is certainly the highlight of our Morocco trip.

I was very apprehensive as I was travelling with my family and two autistic sons. I intitally contacted Zouhair by email and he responded very quickly. We kept in contact until i arrived to Marrekesh.On the day of the trip Zouhair arrived on time which was great as my boys find it difficult to wait, we where in fact running late but Zouhair reassured me it was ok.We travelled in a very comfortable and clean car with WiFi which was great for my teens and husband. Zouhair was very knowledgeable about the locality and kept us entertained along the way, A part of day out we visited a traditional berber house which was great, Zouhair showed us around the house and we finished off by having refreshing mint tea. We arrived to Atlas mountains around midday after a short break my husband and daughter went for a trek while i remained with the other children at the restaurant. We had lunch at the resturant while we waited and my kids played about, the manager did not mind which was great relief for me. My husband arrived after 2 hours with my daughter having throughly enjoyed the trek and stunning waterfalls, after some snacks we made the journey home. We needed to make a stop along the way which was no problem at all for Zouhair, he also picked and dropped us off outside our hotel which was quite far from central Marrekesh with no fuss whatsoever. I would not hesitate to recommend Easy Jet Go Private tours, Zouhair went out of his way to make us comfortable and meet our needs as a family."

I communicated with him in USA about two weeks before our planned visit to Marrakech via Whatsapp. Even with the time difference he usually replies within an hour or two. He answered so many questions and provided advice on things that didn't even have to do with the Day trip we planned with him.My husband and I really wanted to see the goats in the tree so we decided to do the day trip to Essaouira. Very reasonably priced at 600 Moroccan Dirhams per person, about $130 US dollars for both of us. It was as awesome as we expected. Zouhir found a way to pick us up right by the Riad we were staying at even though it was quite tough to get to through all the small streets. The van is very clean as he gets the car cleaned daily, has air conditioning (which was a MUST for my husband) and wifi so we could email, chat and browse social media during the ride there and back. We got to take pictures with the goats on the tree, see how the Moroccan ladies make pure argan oil and take pics on the camels (mini ride) just giving them all small tips.At the end of the day, the most important thing about these private tours is the guide you are with and Zouhir is the best man you can count on!"

Zouhir picked us up on time from the front of our hotel and instantly made the kids happy by telling them that they could use the wifi in the car. As we drove to our first stop Zouhir was full of useful information about the surrounding areas and answered all our questions. We arrived at the Berber house not sure what to expect but was made to feel very welcome after a tour we sat down to enjoy the best mint tea ever with lovely bread,oil,butter and honey. A short car journey and we stopped for a camel ride this was great fun, then a stop at the argon oil cooperative which was interesting. Then we drove further into the mountains to Setti Fatma a bustling little village where we were introduced to our guide Hassan, who took us right to the top of the waterfalls where the views was amazing and well worth the trek. It was then back down for lunch in Setti Fatma to a restaurant that Zouhir recommended, we all had some lovely mixed skewers served with rice,chips and salad at a very good price. We then started the drive back to Marrakech thankful of the aircon in the car, Zouhir even stopped on the way to buy us some gifts that we our very thankful for. Please book Zouhir for any trips whilst you are in Marrakech as he is truly professional and will make any day you spend with him an absolute delight."

Then to the Argan oil co op to see how the oils are extracted and then up to Sitti Fatma for lunch on the river. We opted out of going to the waterfalls which meant we were able to take time to relax by the river and never felt rushed to move on.The last time we came to Marrekesh we were stood up by a tour guide who booked an excursion but never turned up.

I was really ill the night before our our trip & I was only able to give him 2 hours notice of canceling. He told me this wasn't a problem and I should just concentrate on getting better. We postponed to the next day and although he had an airport pick up he was still able to work around things to make it possible for us to still go.Me & my family had an amazing time with Zouhir on this trip. From the very first moment we met him we felt comfortable & relaxed in his presence. He's so friendly & chatty that it doesn't feel awkward at anytime over the day trip. The children took to him instantly and he was really good with them too. Zouhir has a lovely people carrier to drive you around in, he keeps it spotlessly clean and its equipped with aircon which is a big plus in the heat. He also supplied us with some bottles of water.We set off on our trip with Zouhir answering any questions & giving us useful knowledge and information about anywhere we ask or he thought was of importance.Zouhir stopped whenever we asked him too, wether it be for something that caught our eye or because the children needed something to eat or drink. He took us to some great places for photos before taking us to meet a lovely Berber family who made us very welcome. We were able to have a look around their house and try some of the lovely mint tea & bread they'd made. After that we travelled on to Sitti Fatma, stopping at some more great places for photos, Zouhir was always helpful taking pictures when wanting family shots. He even carried my 4yr old across a brigde so she could have a photo on there. When we got to Sitti Fatma Zouhir took us to a really nice place to eat, it was very reasonably priced too. The food was great & Zouhir bought us some fresh cherries to snack on. It was right on the river front so the kids were able to go paddling in the water. Overall we all had such a great time! it was so relaxed & comfortable. With it being a private tour everything is done at your own pace & you have the flexibility with Zouhir to tailor it completely to your own needs. We chose not to do the guided walk to the waterfalls because we thought it would be too hard for our children, this was no problem as its all about what you want to do.So if you'd like to do this trip or something similar you really won't go wrong booking with Zouhir. From the moment you send him the first text or Whatsapp he's right there to help with any bookings.Thanks so much Zouhir & if we ever return to Marrakech I will certainly contact you again."

When I contacted him to plan my trip, he advised me the best choices and recommended me how to do it and helped me to organize with all the details. It turned out to be a fantastic trip. When I emailed him about my trip, he answered all my emails quickly and his price was very reasonable. He speaks English well plus 4 other languages. He has a very nice 7 passenger van, air condition and bottled water, he also offered us to use his I phone with internet throughout the trip. All throughout the 4 day trip Zouhir pointed out many of the highlights and details of the different areas with many stops to eat and drink and taking pictures. He is very knowledgeable throughout the region. He is a very careful and safe driver. All in all it was an amazing 4 dat trip with him.I am a Travel Agent from New York, I did many trips in other countries with driver and guide and Zouhir turned out to be one of the best I had. I would highly recommend him to all my clients, friends, and family traveling to morocco.Many thanks for your advice and caring.Joseph"

The quality of service was impeccable throughout. Zouhir arrived on time and extremely well presented. We were taken to a clean, spacious and air conditioned car. Zouhir's knowledge and love of Morocco was infectious. He is also fantastic company and knows exactly when to be chatty and when to allow downtime -so important on a long trip. He made sure we had regular breaks and opportunities to take photos and that we really felt he made our priorities his priorities. He also made certain we were looked after, even keeping a watchful eye on street vendors and intervening to haggle down prices if he thought we weren't getting the best deal. We had an extremely ambitious itinerary and were amazed and so grateful that Zouhir's enthusiasm and professionalism never wavered, even after 2 consecutive days of 15hr drives! We should also say we arrived well after our connecting train to Casablanca (or any other train) had departed and he personally escorted us to the coach station and then the local bus station and negotiated our seats on the last bus out of town. Zouhir must have been exhausted by this time and this kindness was both way above the call of duty and testament to his commitment to looking after his clients. You need this man for any significant trip you plan to take in Morocco!Cal & Parisa"

It was a lovely trip and was glad we went. Zouhir picked us up from our hotel right on time and we began our journey. He made us feel comfortable straight away and was very friendly and knowledgeable. Not only was Zouhir our driver but also our guide. On the way we stopped off for a comfort break and Zouhir went to the trouble of buying us bottled water for the rest of the journey. After this we stopped of at the goat tree, argan oil organisation and a place where you could pet and ride camels. Once we arrived in Essaouira, we were given directions to the souks and the harbour where we had a few hours to do as we wished. We then we're picked up for lunch at a restaurant recommended by Zouhir. Overall it was a great trip and I would definitely recommend and use Easy Jet Go tours again. Thank you for a great trip."

            "review": "Excellent private desert tour from Marrakech to Fes via Merzouga desert!!. Hello!First of all I just can recommend the 3-Day-Desert-Tour with Zouhir Bengo!He really cared about everything! We started the tour from Marrakech. Due to the fact Zouhir speaks English, German, Spanish, Italian, French etc. you can almost choose, which language you prefer. The first day of the tour we visited the Atlas Mountains and stayed the first night in a very, very nice hotel in Dades, which Zouhir has chosen by himself. The trip was always relaxed, we had enough time to enjoy all the different places and there was always time for some stops to get a coffee. Zouhir also had a lot of extra information about everything, so he was not just a driver, in contrast to other guides, some people, we talked to, had the experience with other companies. He always knew the best places for photos, the best ways to walk to get the best views and where to get cheap and good food. The second day we have been to the Todra Gorge at first. At late evening we arrived at the place, where to start the camel ride to our Berber camp in the desert. Before the ride we even made a stop with Zouhir to get some beer to enjoy the sunset in the desert. The ride through the Sahara to our camp was a really nice experience, we had time to take some pictures and got to know some people, so we had good company at the camp. We even were lucky enough to get an upgrade to the luxury camp with shower und toilet in the tent. At the camp you can go sandboarding, enjoy the sunset, the moon and the stars at the fire place. Zouhir also joined us at the camp and so we had a really great time.All in all I would definitely book the tour with Zouhir Bengo again, because it is probably the best one you can get. He was the most carrying tourguide I ever had and this made Marocco really welcoming for us! He always had these little surprises for us and can give you a lot of information, which made this tour excellent!"

We were glad he did as Zouhir was fantastic. We did the 3 valleys tour which included a visit to a Berber house where we served mint tea, lunch at Setti Fatma and Lalla Takerkoust. Zouhir spoke excellent English was extremely friendly and was more than happy to stop where we wanted for photographs. We were picked up and dropped off near to our Riad at the time stated. We intend to return and will definitely be exploring further afield next time and would not hesitate to contact Zouhir to arrange this."

We had originally booked the Ouzoud waterfall trip but it was raining on the day - thankfully Zouhir suggested the Essaouira trip and not only did we avoid the rain, we stopped to see the world famous argan tree goats as well! Zouhir is your driver guide rolled into one and very informative providing facts and tips along the way. His new mini van is super comfortable and we were provided with water as well. Very important to note is the fact that Zouhir is a careful driver and that there are seatbelt sifted. Perfect for families. En route we stopped at an Argan Oil cooperative where we bought high quality yet very reasonably priced Argan oil. It's truly amazing stuff - don't buy the cheap stuff in the markets.Essaouira, an old coastal town is beautiful and it was wonderful to wander around the fort and the quiet souks. Zouhir even recommended a great fish restaurant by the sea on the edge of the beach for lunch. We had a wonderful day and are so glad we visited this quaint little town. A fabulous day!"

All my e-mail enquiries were answered promptly and good advice given to enable us to make the most of our holidays in Marrakech.Zouhir has done his best to assure that our holiday in Marrakech would be unforgettable for me and my family.The first trip we\u2019ve made was to the Ouzoud waterfalls. This is a good escape from the city and enjoy the nature by visiting the Ouzoud Falls. Zouhir\u00a0\u00a0showed us the olive trees, spoke about the local traditions, history and legends of the waterfall and about the Moroccan culture.We had lunch in one of the terrace restaurants. The food was very tasty and if you love cats and monkeys\u00a0you are going to see one in every corner of the terrace. :)The falls are amazing to look at, one of the highlight of our Morocco trip and a must do when in these parts. We saw it both from the top and from the bottom.Our second trip was to the Ourika valley. Visiting Ourika valley is a great way to spend some peaceful time away from the madness of Marrakech. A day trip is enough to see the beauty of the mountain, admire the waterfalls, enjoy a lunch near the river in Sidi Fatima village. If you are lucky you can even spot some monkeys in their natural environment.\u00a0Zouhir arranged 1 of the best guides Jamal for ttekking in the mountains! Highly recommended as he knows alote about the region and his really a kid of the mountains! :)Our third trip was to the beautiful\u00a0city Essaouira with white and blue walls.This is a working fishing village about 2 hr drive from Marrakesh. The drive was a bit long but the village was pleasant to visit. There were fish for sale on the docks and the normal shops and restaurants to choose from. Not having Fish as lunch in Essaouira is quite impossible!:) Thanks to Zouhir we had a great trial of all different kind of fish as lunch!:) The highlight of our trip were the goats in the Argan tree!Our last but not the least tour was a half day in Marrakech.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Zouhir showed us the Palmeraie side were we had a camel tour. Also not to forget that we paid a visit to the Saadian tombs, Bahia palace and the Menara gardens!Zouhir was very informative on Marrakech history, culture, etc. Not to mention the tour was great at helping us get our bearings and way around the city/souks.I would highly recommend Zouhir for having an unforgettable, terrific and most rememorable expierence in and out of Marrakech!:) Thanks for everything Zouhir!"

We arranged an excursion with him to visit the atlas mountains and Sitti Fatma. From picking us up at our hotel lobby till dropping us off back to the hotel we had an amazing experience. He arranged for us a restraunt to have lunch which was right next to the river allowing us to dip our feet into the water, it was the sitti fatma restraunt. The guide he gave us for the mountains climb was Hassan who we also felt at ease with explaining places and parts of the mountain not many guides would normally tell you. We wanted to purchase a tagine on the return back to the hotel as the market products were very expensive and not of good quality. Zouhir took us to a good place on the way back home returning to the hotel which we appreciated very much not to mention the extra little tour of Marrakech showing us around the new city and good places to visit in the old city. Overall our experience with Zouhir was fabulous, his English was very clear for people who prefer English guides. The main thing was we felt very comfortable with him. Zouhir went out of his way for us many times and did a great deal if looking after. I would definitely recommend Zouhir to everyone who visits Marrakech."

It was just a great pleasure to have been in the company of our private guide for the three day long trip to the Merzouga desert . From the very first moment, he was very responsive, informative and helpful. He gave us great advice on the trip, tailored every detail to our needs, and went the extra mile to make our trip fantastic. Zouhir talks fluently in many different languages (English, Spanish, German, French, Arabic) and is very knowledgable and ready to answer all your questions. His car is comfortable, clean and Zouhir himself is a great driver. The trip to the desert was spectacular, stopping at various photo points along the way including the Atlas Mountains, the Kasbah of Ait Ben Haddo, Ouarzazate, Dades Valley, Todra Gorges, etc. On the first night, Zouhir booked an amazing acommodation (Chez Pierre) with delicious dinner included, it was definitely one of the best meals I have ever had! The hotel was super comfortable, run by very friendly staff. After a long day driving, this was a really welcome stop. On our second day, we were then on our way to the desert in time for the sunset whilst riding camels to the camp. This is where the services offered by Zouhir go above and beyond any tour we have booked. Zouhir was also the only tour guide present during our stay, literally on-call 24/7. The actual experience of staring at the stars around a camp-fire with the local Berbers playing the drums and singing is definitely something I will never forget. Zouhir also told us it is possible to spend the night in the dunes under the star sky, which is what we did and we strongly recommend to every romantic soul. It can get a bit cold, but we took warm blankets from our tent and counted the shooting stars until the sun rise, which was a magical experience. Overall, Zouhir can not do enough for his 'guests'! If you want to have a hassle free amazing experience in Morocco, all you need to do is contact Zouhir. Thanks for everything!"

It was nice, to finally get hold of someone, who listened and accommodated to all our wishes and concerns. He took care of us during our whole journey. He picked us up from the airport with a smile on his face, and kept in contact with us even during the days we were relaxing in the hotel to make sure we were okay. :) So the first tour we booked with him, was the zagora desert tour. Some of group fell sick on the way- and before moving ahead, he ensured they were feeling okay :) we stopped at lots of different spots on the way, and took photos, which was a nice way to break up the journey.. When we finally got to zagora, we left our mini bus, and travelled to our tents by camel.. We watched the sunset, which was totally amazing! When we arrived at our camp site, we were amazed at how cute it was! (Glamping) The tent was cute, with a comfy bed, electricity, warm water and plenty of spare blankets. Food served there was also awesome. We listened to the locals playing with their drums and singing away. Everyone joined in and had a laugh :) The next morning, we woke up early, hiked a sand dune- and watched the sunrise.. It was beautiful :) The second tour we had booked was to the ourika valley. This was by far, my most favourite trip... It was truly beautiful! We were able to hike up to the fourth waterfall, which was challenging and great fun! Our guide was amazing- he really took good care of the kids. :) and it's because of him, that I was able to hike with my little 1 year old.Our third tour was the ouzzad waterfall. This was less challenging then the ourika valley tour.. But the view of the waterfall was stunning :) Zouhir really went out his way, to make sure we had an awesome time.. For instance, he bought bananas before we reached, so we could feed the monkeys.. He paid for the kids to play on the horse.. He bought the kids little gifts.. He really goes out of his way.. Just to make sure everyone is happy.. :) We also booked a quad biking tour. I couldn't go, as I had to look after my 1 year old. But the rest of the group went. They went away for a few hours, and they came back sooo happy! Zouhir was kind enough to find a company to quad bike with and organised it for us. We decided we wanted to go for a spa day, so zouhir did his research and found this awesome spa! We wanted a traditional hammam and massage.. But we didn't want to share it with strangers. So he made sure, that we had two separate private hammams.. One for the boys, and one for the girls. We truly loved this experience. It was a nice end to our holiday.. Zouhir was also kind enough to show us Marrakech before the spa.. So we went to the medina gardens- which was stunning.. Saw the old city of Marrakech.. The old market.. Tombs.. We were able to experience and see parts of Marrakech, that we would have been never seen, if it wasn't for him.I can't recommend Zouhir enough. We have never had a tour guide that has gone beyond what they're supposed to do. He really goes out of his way- just to make sure each member of the group is happy. For instance- he took our clothes to the laundrette for us.. And bought back to the hotel for us. He made sure the transport that was used was suitable for us- modern and comfy. He changed parts of the itineraries to accommodate our needs.. He also gave an amazing deal on all our itineraries.. He didn't charge my 1 year old for anything.. The kids were only charged half price.. Etc"

This is where the services offered by Zouhir go above and beyond any tour we have booked. As a newly married coupled, Zouhir booked us an upgraded private tent at the camp as a welcome present.

We found Easyjet Go tours on trip advisor. The communications was brilliant from Zouhir, we where able to whatapp him, and agree everything. (He speaks several languages)The trip was good from start to finish. Zouhir was early, unlike most people in Morocco.The journey to Marrekesh was comfortable. Zouhir has a 7 seater, leather seats, ac, etc. All seats have plenty of leg room. Zouhir was happy to stop off when we needed.Zouhir provides a great tour of Marrekesh. He took us to 3 different historic locations before lunch. As we was in Marrekesh, we wanted some authentic food. Zouhir took us to a roof top tagine resturant, where we had the best tagines food, really recommend the lemon chicken tagine. We where staying in a riyad, which was bit of a journey itself to get to. Lucky we had Zouhir with us. As he drove us nearly to the door step of the riyad (car could not go any further). He also arrange for the hotel rep to meet us at the drop off, to take us the rest of the way to the riyad. Only reason I am saying this, because when we got a taxi in the evening, he would refuse to go into the local roads, unlike Zouhir. Zouhir was even kind enough to wait for us to drop off our bags at the hotel, and take us to the markets, saved us getting a taxi. Even when we got back to agadir after our trip to Marrekesh, Zouhir should us the best local restaurants to go to, as we where getting fed up with the food. Overall Zouhir is a top guy, treat you with respect and is always professional. If I got back I would be definitely book Zouhir again"

He is humble, genuine, honest, just an outright top human being and it was a pleasure to meet him! We originally arranged just a half day tour of Marrakech but after a short what'sapp conversation he included transfers to and from Agadir at a very fair price. He was waiting in the lobby of our hotel bang on time greeted us with a massive smile and great enthusiasm. We were a group of 5 sizeable friends, Zouhir's van was extremely spacious and comfortable. Above all it was spotless, leather seats, air con positive luxury by any standards. His driving on the hectic streets of Morocco makes you feel safe which is a massive plus after some of the near death taxi rides we had experienced. He gave us information on all the areas we passed, as well as general day to day Moroccan life. On arrival in Marrakech, we had a half day tour taking in the main attraction of the city. He took us to a roof top tagine restaurant, the food, service and cleanliness was fantastic! He took us out to a palm tree covered area on the outskirts of the city to watch the sunset which was a great way to end the day. En route to our Riad he gave us loads of handy tips and hints on where to go what to avoid and how to stay safe. He went the extra mile by waiting for us to check in before giving us a lift to the main square at no extra cost. The following day again Zouhir was on time upbeat and ready to go. We had arranged a trip to the Atlas Mountains but after a rather late night it was plain to see we were in no state to walk up and down hill sides. The change of plan was not at all a problem for Zouhir he took us back to Agadir happily making multiple stops to accommodate the needs of the group. On our return to Agadir Zouhir took us for lunch at a local cafe away from the tourist beach area. It was the best meal of the trip, fresh, tasty and cheap. Zouhir can not do enough for his 'guests'! If you want to have a hassle free amazing experience in Morocco all you need do it contact Zouhir. Thank you again brother. Hope to see you soon!"

Me and my partner were very excited for our trip to the Ozoud waterfalls and had very high expectations for the day, however Zouhir exceeded those expectations and more. He really did go out of his way to make our day special for us, he took us to a beautiful cave which was way out of his way and even used to be a separate trip, free of charge just because he wanted us to see some more of the beauty that is in Marrakech as he knew how much we'd love it, he also drove to a town with us and bought us fresh fruit and cold bottles of water, he then bought bunches of bananas and some nuts for the wild monkeys for us to feed them once we got to the ouzoud falls! Once we'd been there quite a while he introduced us to some lovely Moroccan tea. I should also mention that Zouhir is very good and careful at driving! He mentioned that he has a Moroccan and and European driving license which is very rare so it was easy to feel safe in the car with him as he drives so sensibly. I'm so glad we went on this trip, later on in our holiday I got ill and as Zouhir had our whatsapp number in order to contact us about the trip earlier on he knew, he was so kind! He brought medicine to our hotel for me and checked up on me through my partner until I was better. He truly is a gentleman and I feel we have gained a friend for the next time we visit. He is so easy to get along with, I would not hesitate to book with him again.Thank you for everything Zouhir!"

I got know the manager Mr Zouhir Bengo through a friend who has already used this service and he spoke really good of it so we thought to try it out. We wanted to explore Marrakech and its outskirts but we wanted someone honest and knowledgeable. We contacted Mr Zouhir and he arranged to a private trip to Ourika valleys. We were worried about the language barrier but amazingly Mr Zouhir spoke fluent English and Italian so it was nice knowing we are in good hands. Zouhir met us early in the morning in his clean car (rare in marrakech, no offence) and we headed off to the highway. Mr Zouhir was very friendly and easy going with us, someone who's passionate about what he does. Our first stop was in this beautiful mountain to take some pictures. Our 2nd stop was the barber house where Zouhir arranged a delicious breakfast with amazing people of the house with super delicious tea. We continued to drive through the beautiful outskirts of marrakech and Mr Zouhir arranged for us a trip with an amazing ourkia vally tour guide named hassan (i must say he is really cool and knows all the beautiful spots) we rolled on with mr hassan up the beautiful mountains headed towards to the amazing waterfalls it was one of the best experiences for us. We met really cool and easy going people on the way too. We spent about 2hours with mr hasan and we arrived back to an amazing restaurant by the waterfall with some seriously delicious food (i recommend lamp tagin!). We took some really cool snaps which i will attach. We headed back home and slept like babies on the way back home on those extra comfortable leather seats :p . Lastly, we were really impressed with mt Zouhir and his amazing hospitality. He made things really easy going for us and i will definitely recommend his services to all my friends and family."

Driven and guided by Zouhir to the Ouzoud Waterfalls.A very comfortable, friendly, and pleasant journey as Zouhir offered great knowledge of the beautiful surroundings as well as smooth driving as he has a European drivers licence, and a very nice car.. We also enjoyed a few stop-offs in passing towns for fruit and tea.Once we reached the waterfalls Zouhir led us down the side cliff on a private trek, enjoying the breathtaking views as we descended into the other side of the falls.Luckily we were advised to wear sport or mountain shoes prior to walking down the very steep cliffsides, with Zouhir kindly helping us down the more treacherous areas.We eventually reached the base of the falls which at this point was a fast flowing river with many smaller waterfalls every 20meters or so (see pictures). Word's simply can't describe the beauty of the place, and unfortunately the pictures don't do much justice either. But it was incredible looking back up at the cliffs we had just trekked down, and crossing the river on hopping stones and basic bridges. We even spotted and fed a few monkey on our way, and there were even people swimming in some of the pools of the river which looked quite fun.As we followed the river back up to the waterfall, we passed many other smaller waterfalls, stop-off points, tent hotels, small restaurants and souvenir shops which was fun. and once we finally reached the falls we enjoyed a cup to tea with Zouhir at a small cafe right at the bottom of the falls which was great. We then trekked up a few stairs on to a fantastic up-close viewing point, and another set of stairs to the area's best restaurant with another great view. We finalised our day walking up to a special monkey spot where we were able to feed a whole monkey family bananas and nuts Zouhir had bought for them which was amazing.Thank you so much Zouhir! Fantastic service! I look forward to another day trip with you on my next holiday to Morocco!"

He was polite, considerate, spoke fluent english and an absolutely genuine individual. He made the trip to Agadir enjoyable, showed us sites along the drive and made sure we as a family were always happy especially my little daughter. In comparison to other tour guides in morocco, our comfort and enjoyment was important to him and money was not the primary concern of zouhir. He allowed us plenty of time to enjoy the sites and beach in Agadir, and we never felt rushed. To top everything off, he in his own time found a wildlife park close to the beach for my daughter to go to, which he surprised us with. On the way back to the hotel he made another stop for us, which was an additional stop but yet again he did this with a smile. I was overly pleased with EasyJet Go's service and would definately recommend others to use it to have a beautiful and plesant stay in morocco."

I have never written a review before, but my husband and I enjoyed our tour so much with Zouhir Bengo that we were moved to write one. Due to time constaints ,we went against the recommended 3-4 day tour from Marrakesh to Merzouga, and decided to do it in 2 days. This could have been an uncomfortable disaster, but instead it was perfect. Zouhir picked us up right on time (he was actually early). We were excited to find out that we would have a wonderful, clean, spacious,private vehicle to ride in, and were even more excited to find out that the A/C worked very well. It didn't take us long to realize that Zouhir Bengo was a caring and trustworthy man that was truly interested his customers' comfort and enjoyment. It was a 12 hour trip to get to the desert by sunset. He stopped at some amazing sights along the way and was sure to give us just enough time for us to enjoy the experience, but still get to the desert in time. On our way back the next day, Zouhir added an extra stop (even though he had driven 20 out of the last 30 hours) because he found out we were interested in visiting the film studios. The studios had actually just closed, but he spoke to several people to get us in. Zouhir Bengo was a wonderful tour guide; safe, responsible, knowledgable, concerned with our comfort. But what I appreciated the most about him is his genuinely beautiful heart. He will spend time finding out exactly what you are interested in and then design a trip that is perfect for you. We HIGHLY recommend EasyJet Go Marrakech Private Day Tours! Thanks again, Zouhir!"

Right from picking us up at our Riad (having made sure he found the best place to park for convenience), the whole day was just perfect. Zouhir is polite, friendly, well spoken (in many languages) and smartly dressed. He is very knowledgeable about Marrakech and Morocco generally and made the whole journey very interesting. It's a long drive but we were so comfortable in his excellent vehicle with lots of room and comfort. He pointed out things of interest on route and kept us from being bored. A nice stop on route for coffee and snacks and also let us stop again to get water and some fruit. The falls are quite lovely and he managed to get us a table for lunch right at the edge of the terrace overlooking the waterfall, what a perfect spot. Lunch was very good value and beautifully cooked - very good choice on his part. He explained all the different options of going right down to the river and the possibility of taking a boat ride or swimming or just going to the viewing platform, browsing the nice little stalls on route and he even bought a bag of peanuts for us to feed the monkeys. We booked another trip around Marrakech with Zouhir and this was also just perfect. Obviously the scenery and the experience were fantastic but what really made this trip special was the care and attention Zouhir took in looking after our every need, listening to what we wanted and being possibly the nicest most polite person on earth. We won't forget his kindness or efficiency for a very long time. If you're thinking of booking tours whilst in Marrakech, I can't recommend him enough - reliable, trustworthy, friendly and took care of everything we could want - and lastly, his prices are very reasonable with no hidden extras. Cannot rate Zouhir highly enough."

It would be easy just to give a great rating and a few compliments but I really think it would be helpful to others considering booking through this company to know exactly WHY they get a good review. Where to start? Firstly when dealing via email before our trip - fantastic. Zouhir replies swiftly and answers all questions openly and honestly. He made it easy and simple to arrange details, no hassle, no complications. I'd approached several different tour companies and his fast replies and assurances were better than all the rest. Next, he worked with us to suit our needs not just his. He made sure we were happy with the arrangements and was flexible - we so didnt feel that we had to 'take it or leave it' - it felt tailor made for us. We booked several trips with him and the first one was to pick us up from our Riad - the location of which was hidden away in a total nightmare maze of alleyways in the Medina. He had made a special trip the day before our arrival to ensure he knew where it was and find the most convenient parking place near to the riad (so as not to inconvenience us) - very impressed at his concern for his customers. The first day trip was a tour around Marrakech, outside of the medina. This was lovely. He took us to lots of interesting places, let us wander around inside on our own at our leisure and was always waiting nearby when we returned. He then found us a lovely rooftop restaurant for lunch - great food, good prices and the nicest waiters on earth - great choice. He made sure we were seated where we wanted, understood the ordering process and menu and then left us to enjoy our meal in peace, coming back near the end to see if all was okay and if we were ready to move on. The second day trip was a lengthy one out to the Ouzod waterfall. A long drive but he made sure we were comfortable, stopped off for refreshments on route and also stopped a second time so we could stock up on water and some fruit. On route he pointed out various place of interest and made sure we were comfortable and answered questions etc. The trip was the day before my 60th birthday and just before leaving the falls and going back to the vehicle, he stopped at a stall and had them make a little plaque with my name in arabic as a birthday present - I was overwhelmed at his kindness.Lastly, we had arranged to revisit the lunchtime restaurant on the evening of my birthday and he sorted out the reservation etc., then made a special trip to pick us up from the Riad and take us to the restaurant - at his own expense! At the end of the meal, the waiters came over with some cake and started to sing happy birthday (much to my embarrassment - but very touched). I found out that Zouhir had arranged this. What more can you say - this chap is supremely polite, very caring and thoughtful, very knowledgeable about what to see and do, well dressed, well spoken, very reasonably priced and the vehicle used was top of the range being spacious, comfortable leather seating etc and he is a courteous and law abiding driver too - quite the exception in Marrakech believe me. I have honestly never encountered someone so customer focused and efficient on any trip I've taken before. Whatever your requirements - I can from the bottom of my heart recommend this gentleman (and that's what he is - a gentleman)"

From our very first email exchange to the end of the trip it was an unbelievable experience. Ali works hard to tailor make the trip to your need and does a great job !Selects a good mix of accommodations to give you the best experience. He delivers to the finest detail and at a very reasonable price. No surprises ! We had Khalid as our guide and driver and he was amazing. A very humble, respectful man and an extremely responsible driver. We felt at great ease with him driving around Morocco. He would go the extra mile to make every minute of our trip memorable and always with a smile even after some very long days of driving. We would highly recommend him.Morocco is a mystical country and Camel Safaries did an excellent job in making it a magical experience for us."

I couldn't have expected better, Mustapha and Hassan were the kindest and most professional people we met in Morocco. The Sahara was completely infatuating. This tour was life changing, eye opening and all because of the great efforts both Mustapha and Hassan went through to make it that way. Don't miss out! But be aware, it's a lot of driving. If you want to experience the desert and mountains as you see it on films and in games, take this trip. You won't regret it. Thanks so much for the life changing experience.Ryan & Charlotte"

My husband and I did a week-long tour around a large portion of Morocco. Ali was very responsive and willing to create a customized itinerary for us, including picking us up at the airport. The price was very reasonable and the experience exceeded our expectations in all aspects. Mohammed was a terrific driver and guide. He gave us great recommendations for food and took us to interesting locations. He made sure to stop if we wanted to take photos, go to the restroom, or get something to eat. He is friendly and very knowledgeable. We learned so much about culture, religion, and history in Morocco and Mohammed was happy to participate in an exchange of perspectives. The overnight trip in the desert was one that had been on my bucket list, and the experience was truly incredible (although camels aren't very comfy to ride and I wouldn't recommend going any longer than a couple of hours on a camel). I especially loved meeting Mohammed's family and sharing food and tea with them. My husband and I have traveled a lot, usually by ourselves, but this tour was by far one of our favorite travel experiences. My husband had been a little nervous about visiting Morocco because he didn't really know what to expect, and he ended up loving it largely due to Mohammed making us feel so comfortable and well-informed."

Our tour guide mustaffah was so kind and spoke excellent English. He really went the extra mile when catering to our needs, he even bought us water when he knew we would need it and went back to a hotel to retrieve a necklace I had lost which I really appreciated. Our driver Hassan was also amazing, he drove excellently and was a very friendly guy. I would definitely recommend this tour to anyone who wants to discover a bit more of morocco and doesn't mind long car journeys. My boyfriend and I did the 3 day 2 night Sahara desert tour which was a good amount of time to see everything we wanted to see. If going on this tour I would advise you bring some change for water as you are travelling for most of the day and change for toilets which usually cost about 2dh.Thank you for having us!Charlotte and Ryan"

Our driver Hassan and guide Mustapha were beyond excellent! Must ask for them. Hassan is a very safe and courteous driver, while Mustapha was very knowledgeable explaining the culture and landscape of Morocco along the way in excellent English. Mustapha was also very thoughtful and considerate, anticipating our needs and made sure we were safe and comfortable at all times. He even gave us helpful tips on bargaining and what to watch out for in Marrakech. Both were very polite and reliable. We hope Hassan and Mustapha were able to spend more time with their family after dropping us off in Marrakech. They returned home from a tour prior to ours and had only one hour to spend with them before they were told that they had to be in Marrakech next day for us.

The drives were long however we had several stops along the way to stretch our legs and also take spectacular views from different vantage points. The terrain is diverse from Marrakech with an overnight stay in Dades Valley. Mustapha had so much knowledge about the Berber culture and Morocco and he also gave us a number of tips about local bargaining and what to be careful about. The Sahara was a beautiful and fun experience with the camel ride, sunset and sunrise. The food was sooo good. We had tagines and vegetables. We highly recommend Camel Safaries for tours in Morocco.

We booked 6 nights (3 in Marrakech and 3 going to and returning to desert)The desert portion we did firstOur guide for the desert portion was Mustapha he was amazing!!! The teenagers thought so highly of him- us adults thought he looked after us and every need he anticipated. The camel trek into the Sahara was undeniably surreal - again Mustapha personally made sure everything was looked after other people on our Sahara trek did not have a personal guide solely anticipating our needs and making sure we were happy. These three nights unbelievable book this tour FOR SUREThe hiccups came upon our return to Marrakech - this may be the loss of Mustapha as he is a desert tour guide and a let down after the camel highlightBut the accommodations in Marrakech which were suppose to be luxurious had problems - yes they moved us in rooms on 3 occasions in 1 night ( no air con, toilet broken etc) not camel safaris fault and they even offered to move to a different hotel but overall the next nights in Marrakech drastically paled in comparison to the first 3. The city tour quite frankly boring, we needed recommendations or help for dinner and basically relied on trip advisor....Overall the company was very good but the riad Bahia Salam (think boutique hotel) in Marrakech notHowever Mustapha and the first 3 nights AMAZING!!!!Do this trip do this company and definitely request Mustapha"

I was traveling alone, as my travel purpose was self knowledge, but yet with Camel Safaries service and care I felt safe and confident all the time, without loosing my moments of introspection. I had a driver and guide that was with me the whole time. His name is Khalid, a young Berber man. He was definitely the perfect guide for me: extremely respectful, humble, honest, patient. Generous in sharing his knowledge, his culture and his passion for the Berber culture and music. Yet, Khalid knew how to respect my moments of silence. A careful driver, the kind you can take a quick nap in the car with no concerns. Also the company owner was touch basing with me the whole time, to guarantee I was pleased and having the best experience possible. A lifetime experience, with great learnings!"

Short version of our trip...book it, request Mustapha, enjoy and make many memories. The long version follows:My first point of contact was Ali through the company email. He always responded quickly and answered all of my questions. Since we (married couple in our 50\u2019s) had never visited Morocco or used a private guide, we had lots of questions. I\u2019m sure Ali was sitting back thinking \u201cmake this stop\u201d, but he was great. \uf04a At first I thought the price was a little on the high side, but once we finished our trip, we felt like it was more than worth it! We did the two nights, three day private trip Marrakech to Marrakech. We were met right on time at our riad in Marrakech by Mustapha. He has a great personality and speaks English very well. Throughout the trip he gave us information regarding the area, the customs and lifestyle of the various regions and even shared information about himself and his family. There are designated stops, but you are also welcome to ask to stop to see something that interest you along the way. At every stop, both Mustapha and the driver were there to open and close our car doors...gentlemen!Each time there was a view or site that took our breath way, we didn\u2019t think it could be topped...until the next stop. Our trip through the Atlas Mountains was unbelievable. We made many stops along the way to the Sahara. We paid a little more to have a couple of extras with no regrets. Our stop for the night at Dades was at the Kasbah Xhaloca. We usually stay at mom and pop type of places, but wow, this was amazing. Once we arrived at the Sahara dunes, we were able to relax before our trip into the desert for the night. The camels were an adventure of their own traveling the dunes! I don\u2019t know that I have ever experienced a more serene trip, it was so quiet and beautiful. Two guides led us and a few others to our bivouac where Berber tents were already set up. The food, music and company were excellent. It was a really hot night and we pulled out mattress out into the sand for the night. The next morning we rode the camels back to meet Mustapha and our driver for the long trip back to Marrakech. Although it was a long ride, we still made a few stops and Mustapha was a true guide to the end."

Morocco has a little bit of something for everyone. My favourite was definitely the desert, it was beautiful with sand so soft, I was in raptures which coming from someone who says they hate sand is something! What made the desert was the sunrise. Hats off to Mustapha who was the only guide to get us up early enough to climb the dunes to watch the sunrise, it was special, up there alone in the beauty of the sunrise. Thank you Mustapha for adding that special moment to our trip.Thank you Ali at Camel Safaris for arranging our trip and an even bigger thanks for Mustapha and Hassan, our fabulous guide and driver.

Our first night, we stayed at Chez Pierre in the Dades Valley. Definitely one of the highlights of the trip due to their attention to customer service and ensuring a great experience for their guests. (I highly recommend this hotel if you are staying in the area!). The following day, we made our way to Erg Chebbi for our camel safari. We made it to the camp just in time to watch the sunset on the sand dunes, followed by dinner under the stars. By far the best experience on the trip...next to waking up the following morning watching the sunrise over the Sahara! The entire trip couldn't have gone any better and was well organized by Camel Safaries. Anas, our guide, was also very accommodating.

You stop at many different places along the way so you can get a good look at the land. Our guide was very knowledgeable of Morocco and answered all of my (many) questions regarding the history, the people and the landscape.First night you slept at an absolutely amazing Riad on a hillside. The second night you the ride the camel to the large canvas tents within the dunes but we ended up just sleeping outside on the dune under the stars (after watching desert foxes by torch light - beautiful experience).Our guide was Mustapha who was absolutely brilliant! Our driver was Hasan who was also great fun. Both genuinely nice men.This tour would be great to do solo, as a couple or with family or friends.

The result: Amazing experience, unforgettable moments, cool pictures and the best, the opportunity to get to know the culture from the locals!! Normally I am sceptic when I book something online without a reference from someone I know, but I must say this tour was beyond our expectations: price, flexibility, punctuality, organization, hospitlity...all you could have asked for!We traveled 8 days from Fez down to Marrakesh, going through the Sahara Desert (wich for me was the best part of the trip for) and including the beach part, Essaouira, where we were lucky to enjoy the Gnoua Music Festival. These guys really do an awesome job. Everything was perfectly organized, the accomodation were veryyyy nice, clean and autenthic, the tours in the cities gave us an insight about the relegion, the history and the culture, the food was delicious and our driver, Anas, was the most friendly and nice person ever! He became part of our group!!! We saw many things in these 8 days and got a real taste of the hospitality and wonders of Morocco. We even had some cooking and traditional dancing classever I will definetely come back to Morocco and I can only recommend cammel safaries. You don't have to worry about ANYTHING and they really make your trip according to your interests, budget and time. "

Picked up on time by Ali in a nice 4x4 and headed for 4 day / 3 night tour to the desert and heart of Morocco (I would have even done 1 more day to go slower - probably sleep at Ait-Benhaddou). Hotels were great (and my wife is quite picky!), and staying at the Desert was great as well (with bed and lamp). Our driver Ali was great. We asked to meet his family at Risani and had lunch with them at their place. Always felt comfortable with him and he drives safely, and appears to know a lot of people. I totally recommend Camel Safaries. Thank you. The highlight of our trip!"

Our guide and driver did very well (his name was Idir) and we had a great comfort in the car. The lodging that was arranged was also better than expectations. Another good thing was that all the communication with the travel agency prior and during the trip was very quick and efficient. I would definitely recommend Camel Safaries."

Over all, the trip is well organised. All the stops we have made, they all have clean toilet and clean food. Before we have booked, we didn't realise how long it takes to go to Zagora. It is about 7 hours drive with 1 hour rest. The slight is amazing on the way tho! The atlas mountain is so beautiful, and full of colours. Our driver/guide is lovely, but he speaks only a bit English. I won't have minded, if when I first contact, they have promised to send a English speaking guide. The guide is also a bit ill (cold, I think) on the way there, and got worse (coughing) on the way back. We both have felt ill on the 2nd day back from the trip. It is just not very nice to be ill on holiday. It would be better if they didn't send someone who is unwell on the job. It's just that you spend 16 hours in the same car, it is difficult to avoid to it."

First of all Ali was extremely helpful and timely in his answers to our inquiry mails. Our guide came picking us up at our hotel in Marrakech, and the journey begun through different landscapes (the atlas, canyons, rocky desert and dunes desert). The stops were well placed and the hotels chosen very good (even in the cheapest version of the tour). Our guide was young but very Nice and I want to thank him (Mubarak) for all the explications, the help and the stories he told us. The experience to spend the night in the desert it's amazing. Don't worry the \"tent\" are very good with a real bed inside so you don't need to bring enything to feel confortable. Only thing the last day of the tour is a lot of driving so if you have the possibility I advice to make the 4 days tour that makes the going back easier.All in all an incredible experience (even if a little bit expensive) but worth to do at least once in a lifetime."

            "review": "3 Day 2 Night Marrakech to Marrakech tour. My wife and I booked a 3 day 2 night trip. Ali, the organizer was very prompt in his replies and any questions we had. We paid 310 euros per person for a mid level accommodations. There was an option for budget accommodations for 280 euros per person as well. 1st day: Mohammed, our driver and guide, picked us up at our Riad at 8am. We went to the Atlas Mountains, the UNESCO World Heritage Site of A\u00eft Benhaddou (site of movies) , and Rose valley. Most of the stops were just a 3-5 min stop where we would take some pictures of the background. It would've been nicer if Mohammed would explain a little bit of the significance of each stop so we can appreciate the scenery a little more. Overnight, we stayed at a very nice hotel with dinner included. 2nd day: We went to the Todra Gorge and we were able to trek along the Gorge for around half an hour. It was a very nice hike with wonderful views of the gorge. Afterwards, we went to some fossil museum and other little shops. Around 3pm, we arrived at the hotel where we would take the camel trek. The highlight of the whole trip was taking the camel trek to the dessert and sleeping in the tent overnight. 3rd day: The last day is pretty much a car drive all the way back to Marrakech. It was a 10-11 hour drive straight with pit stops for washroom stops/lunch break. Pro: The whole trip was worth it for just for the camel trek, sand dunes and sleeping in the dessert. Everything else was just bonus.Con: A LOT of driving. 3rd day was pretty much all driving. Be prepared for that. Wish the guide/driver Mohammed would've came out of the car at the stops and explained the sites a little more."

Ran into a bit of trouble weather-wise; the Atlas Mountains were completely snowed out so we had to go around the entire mountain range which extended our first day from like, 4 hours of driving to closer to 10. Thankfully our driver Abdul and the rest of our group was absolutely fantastic about everything, and Abdul did a tremendous job of adapting to the issues that arose. The sights we saw, people we met, things we did, and food we ate were all of top quality, and I even liked it so much that I proposed to my girlfriend on the trip! Started the tour with a girlfriend and ended with a fiancee; you can't really ask for much better than that. I would 100% recommend taking a trip with these folks."

As a solo female traveler, I felt more than comfortable, and I would recommend this tour to anyone who is travelling to Morocco (whether you are alone or with friends). I learned a ton about local Moroccan cultures and customs as well as fun facts, jokes and proverbs. The trip was evenly paced in that driving periods were not too long and breaks were just the right amount of time to stretch and see some sights. The first day involved going through the High Atlas mountains, visiting the Ait Benhaddou kasbah, learning history and posting up at a guest house in the Dades Valley. The guest house was fantastic. Great food, awesome views, friendly staff. The second day involved visiting the Todra Gorges and driving through some of the most remarkable mountain and desert settings on our way to the Erg Chebbi dunes. The camel ride was so fun, and the sunset and sunrise from the dunes were gorgeous. The camp was more like \"glamping\", which was a pleasant surprise. We had dinner in the camp, but breakfast was at the Kasbah Mohayut (where we launched the camel trek from). The staff is very friendly there, and the food was delicious. The third day was all about driving back to Marrakech and stopping along the way to see beautiful oasis scenes.  This tour was life-changing, and it made me want to stay in Morocco for a longer trip. I can't thank Mohammed enough for being the best guide and friend. I will be back, and I'm happy to call Morocco one of my favorite places in the world. If you're wondering whether or not you should go on this tour, do it. Absolutely do it. You'll be grateful you did."

I've been in many places and seen a lot, but I'm still excited about what we have seen and enjoyed in Morocco. And it wouldn\u2019t be possible without our fantastic tour guide Ali.Morocco completely shattered my initial perception of it \u2013 for me Morocco is a great contrast country \u2013 during 10 days we enjoyed so lot - the snow, the sun, the desert, mountains and power of Atlantic Ocean. Fantastic landscapes, people, regardless of the circumstances in which perhaps the majority of them live in - are open, positive and pleasant.Picnic in the Sahara desert, camel safari and night in the Sahara desert under the stars, off-road trip in the Atlas mountains, meeting with nomads and so much else. Each city, which we has seen its path with its charm, all of them are well worth seeing and unforgettable. Each accommodation where we stayed during our trip is noteworthy. My advice is to use these small Riads, rather than look for classic hotels. If you want to feel flavors of Morocco you have to try night at small and nice riad (for example in Marrakech we spent the night at riad de I\u2019Orientale - a charming place).And of course, if we are talking about Morocco, we have to talk about Moroccan cuisine - tagines, taktouka, fruits, olives, dates, fantastic sweets, ooo, I enjoyed every of them!Our trip was so opulent impressions and emotions that I still live in these emotions although I\u2019m already away from Morocco. I hope it will be enough with these memories and emotions to wait till the next time when I could return there and continue enjoy the various colors, tastes and sensations of Morocco. But I\u2019m sure, I will visit Morocco once again.Thanks Morocco, Camel Safaries and especially to Ali for leaving so pleasant footprints in our souls."

First, Camel Safaris worked with us to tailor our itinerary so it was just right for us. They were by far the best price and the best with communication. We knew exactly what we were getting, while other companies (and we talked to a bunch) were vague and noncommittal. They definitely had the best value for money. We had a very comfortable vehicle that made the long trip easy, and the planned stops broke up the itinerary in a way that kept things interesting. Everything we saw was fascinating and beautiful. The kids especially had a blast riding camels into the desert dunes to the camp. But I reserve my highest praise for our driver Hassan and our guide Lahcen. They were so friendly and playful with the kids, and they were informative, helpful and flexible in a way that really made the trip shine for us. Thanks!"

I asked if he is buying for his sister that stays near fes, it isn't. He was buying to feed the stray dogs on the way to fes. As my girlfriend is a dog lover, we did to same thing.

The hotel we stayed on the first night was really good. On the next day we took our quadricycles to get to the camp, which, in my opinion, was a much better choice (I think they might have bugees as well, but, either way, you have to ask for it in advance).

The long drive was broken up into perfectly pre-planned stops for photos and food.

We aren't \"guided tour\" type of people but due to the little time we had in Morocco and the distance it took to get to the Sahara, we decided it would be best. I did a LOT of research for this trip and based on reviews, we went with Camel Safaris. It was one of the best choices we made in planning our trip to Morocco. Fair prices and excellent communication with Ali. Mohammad, our guide, was nothing short of perfect! He was very friendly, kind, helpful, fun, knowledgeable, and easy to talk to. On Day 1 he picked us up @8am from our riad and spent the day driving and sightseeing along the way. He would stop anytime we asked for photos or otherwise. We toured Ben Ait Haddou (amazing!) - Mohammad gave us an introduction and then let us explore on our own. It was very interesting to drive through many small towns and stop to observe a few Berber villages, all while Mohammad gave us information and answered all of our questions. We stayed at Riad Itran that night, and wow!! was it fantastic! It was our favorite accommodation during our entire trip around Morocco. Beautiful location, charming riad, warm and friendly staff and delicious food. Day 2 we continued our drive through oases and palmeries and a second kasbah that is setup as a museum.We arrived to our camels where we met our guides and camels. We trekked in before sunset. Yes, it was about as cool as you could imagine. The kids played on the dunes until dark when we were served a delicious tagine dinner and mint tea. The camp in a permanent site with individual pods with actual beds and electricity in them. We were not expecting that! It was very cold that night but with 5 blankets, we were very warm. We played drums around the fire that night and watched what little stars we could since it was cloudy :( The next morning we climbed up the dunes to watch the sunrise before packing up and heading back out. The camel ride was only about 1 hour each way. I would have liked it to be a little longer. The camp itself is on the edge of the Sahara really - you could see the town in the distance when looking west. On our return drive we had to pass through the snowy Atlas Mts - the Berber villages we saw on Day 1 were covered in snow! Luckily the roads had been cleared enough to let us through. We returned to Marrakesh about 8pm that evening. Amazing and well organized trip. I highly recommend this company to anyone!!!"

He met me at the riad I had stayed at in Marrakech, and we set off on our journey from there. Mohammed made me feel comfortable immediately. We became fast friends as the first day was about 4 hours in the car, driving along the winding roads that climb through the beautiful Atlas Mountains and through a number of small towns. The sights along the way were amazing - gorgeous mountains, the kasbah at Ait-Ben-Haddou, the dwellings made of mud and clay, grazing goats and more. I could have taken thousands of pictures and felt it wasn't enough! Mohammed is a knowledgeable guide, and I fear I didn't ask enough questions of him, as we were having too much fun swapping stories about our lives. A highlight of this first day was when we stopped so I could take pictures of a herd of goats, and the goat herder invited us to have tea with him. We sat with him on the ground while he made a small fire and then made the tea. He had one small glass, and we all drank from it. It was a pretty special moment for me! That evening, we stayed at the hotel Kasbah Itran. The hotel overlooks the Rose Valley. We had dinner here, and then the staff and Mohammed played the drums and sang. We all ended up dancing in a circle together while singing, clapping and/or playing the drums. What a fun night! Here, I had an amazing room with stained glass windows and a view over the Valley. This was facing east, and the sunrise was stunning. After our breakfast, we started off for our journey into the desert. We stopped to look at the town Boumalne Dades at the edge of the Dades Valley - such an amazing view. This town looks like an elaborate sand castle against a backdrop of palm trees and the Atlas Mountains. We also stopped in the spectacular Todgha Gorge which was carved by the Todgha and Dades Rivers. After an authentic lunch of cous cous (it was Friday) in the town of Rissani, we continued on to the edge of the Sahara Desert, where we got on our camels for our ride (just over an hour) into Erg Chebbi - one of Morocco's two Saharan ergs - sand dunes. The camel ride was fun and easy(for me) and the camel was very well-behaved. This part of the desert is amazing - vast and with high dunes - just what I wanted to see! Mohammed and I climbed a dune near our camp; this may have been easy for my new friend, but not for me!!! But I was happy to do it for the great view! The tent camp is very comfortable - with rugs on the sand, a bathroom with running water, even a dining tent. I had my own tent of course, and the bed was comfortable and had plenty of blankets! That night we had a great dinner and then sat around a campfire until very late playing the drums and singing. The next morning, I climbed that dune again in order to watch the sunrise over the desert. This was another special moment! After that, we got back on the camels and went back to the edge of the desert where we had a hearty breakfast before heading on our long trek (8-9 hours) back to Marrakech. We had stops along the way, including lunch in an interesting town that was having its weekly market, and an area that was filled with fossils embedded into the rocks. This trip was amazing, filled with special experiences. As we neared the end, I was very sad as it meant saying goodbye to my great new friend, Mohammed. He made this trip the best it could be for me! it is clear Mohammed enjoys his job! He is personable, friendly, informative and thoughtful. He also takes great photos - hand him your camera or your smart phone and let him take some great pictures of you on this trip. I would highly recommend Camel Safaries to anyone - the experience was beyond my expectations. I want to do this again!!!"

The accommodation (both hotels and Saharan camp) were perfect. Probably the highlight was the camel ride across the Sahara to stay 1 night in a Saharan camp. The camp itself had comfortable beds, plenty of blankets, and warm running water. We sat by the camp fire in the evening singing and playing music with the staff. We also got to see a great variety of Moroccan scenery and sites. I highly recommend Mohammed and Hasan to anyone considering a tour."

            "review": "The perfect 4-day trip!. Simply, wow! We are so pleased that we chose Camel Safaries for our trip from Marrakech to the Sahara and then up to Fes. From the moment that our guide Abdoul and our driver Hassan picked us up in Marrakech, we knew we were in good hands. The 4x4 car was clean and comfortable and the journey, while long, never felt arduous. Hassan was an excellent driver and we felt safe the whole time. Abdoul is simply the best guide. He is knowledgable, friendly, professional and clearly loves his job. I fell ill during the trip and we were really impressed with the care taken to ensure I got medication I needed (despite many of the pharmacies being closed).Abdoul was incredibly flexible and allowed for customization along the route. Once we indicated that we enjoyed eating the local food, we got to experience a real Moroccan treat of grilled lamb in a local cafe! We thoroughly enjoyed the itinerary set out by Camel Safaries and felt that the stops were well thought out and well timed. The hotels that we were booked on were perfect. Small and intimate with lovely staff and delicious food. We ate extremely well on this trip!Ali was also extremely responsive and flexible during the planning stage. All in all, we cannot recommend this company or our guides Abdoul and Hassan enough... simply amazing!"

This trip completely exceeded our expectations and has been by far the highlight of our Morocco trip.Mohammed, our guide was an absolute star- he's one of the most genuine, friendly, kind people you will ever meet. He makes the journey interesting as he provides knowledge along the way to break up the long drives. He's so upbeat which is infectious, and we loved his camel dancing. He went above and beyond as he really cares that you enjoy your trip, and he really does become like a good friend.We felt in very safe hands with our driver Hassan, as he is a great driver- very safe and we didn't even flinch driving up the mountain roads with high drops (in other countries with similar roads I've resorted to closing my eyes in fear but this time I could enjoy the view!) Hassan is also a really friendly, helpful person and he and Mohammed make a great team.Booking our trip was easy, as Ali responded to all of my emails quickly and clearly, which assured me that I'd picked the right company for this trip as there seems to be a lot of choice! The hotel we stayed at for the first night was lovely, way nicer than we expected for the price! And the Berber camp on the second night was also beyond our expectations- we expected (and would have been happy with) basic facilities, but this was practically glamping- we had a real bed, real flushing toilets, amazing food and a magical evening under the stars! Thank you so much Camel Safaries! We will definitely be recommending this trip to all of our friends."

Our trio certainly wouldn't have been as great without our incredibly charming, sweet, considerate, efficient guide Mohammed and not to mention one of the best drivers!

At the suggestion of another couple, we booked our tour with Ali Oussou's company, Camel Safaris. Best decision we could have made. We did the 5 night tour, which included a night in the Erg Chebbi Dunes. and everything was spectacular. Our tour guide was Mohammed, and he was just great. He gave great commentary on the area, the people and culture and could answer our questions; he knew when to pull over so we could take pictures and every lunch restaurant we went to was delicious!The tour itself was well organized. All hotel and travel arrangements were made in advance; Ali even booked our hotel in Marrakesh for us (we stayed 2 extra nights after the tour in the city). Ali himself was timely with all email responses both before and after the tour - it was really wonderful to go on a trip and not have to worry about anything - they did a superb job. It was our first time in Marrakesh and it could not have been a more pleasant trip. The people were friendly, the food was excellent - I highly recommend both the country and Camel Safaris."

It was well organised and interesting but more than that my friend, son and I were treated like friends or family, not just clients. Right from start Ali was great with communication when organising and planning the tour and patiently responded to my many emails. The four day tour that we went on was amazing and a great mix of things such as a camel trek at Erg Chebby dunes, feeding monkeys at a forest, seeing amazing sites and visiting local people and a local market. There was flexibility as well, for example, in whether we wanted to do some shopping and where we wanted to eat. We really enjoyed the local food places that we were taken to. Even though we travelled long distances, it was comfortable in the four wheel drive, the scenery was amazing and our guide/driver Mohammed kept it interesting for us. He is a very friendly, funny guy who knows the country and the culture very well and we learnt so much from him. The hotels that we stayed at were great as well and the staff were very friendly. Our time with Camel Safaries was easily the best part of our trip to Morocco even though we enjoyed the whole trip and it was the best holiday I've had. Thanks to Mohammed and Ali for a great holiday that I'll never forget."

By advance planning through examination of their website and also e-mail correspondence with owner Ali, all arrangements were made and executed beautifully. Since our group consisted of just my wife and I, we were assigned a Toyota Land Cruiser 4x4 with Guide Mostapha and driver Hassan for this 3 day, 2 night desert tour. Both were excellent and friendly, and there was no language issues as Mostapha spoke good English and Driver Hassan understood and could communicate directly or thru Mosptapha. The details of the itinerary are given on the website, so will not repeat here. The first day highlight was a visit to the world famous Kasbah Ben Houdou where over 25 Hollywood films were filmed. These include the iconic Lawrence of Arabia, The Gladiator, Pearls of Persia, Game of Thrones, etc. Just a word of caution: lunch at the supposedly \"best\" restaurant in this village was a disaster! Better to bring a packed lunch with you. Not the fault of Camelsafaries as all tour buses/cars stop at this place. Food here is really bad. The kasbah trek made up for the bad food, and the information given by our guide Mostapha was invaluable. The hotel Xaluca dades on the first night had excellent buffet dinner and equally good breakfast. Wi-fi works only in the hotel lobby and not in the rooms. But the loacation of the hotel and the food were both excellent! The second day highlight was a trip to the gorge, lunch at our guide Mostapha's home near the desert. His sister Zahara cooked us an excellent covered Pizza, with salad and starter almonds and other nuts. The next day, our driver Hassan's sister cooked for us a really spicy similar pizza to take away and eat while we were driving. Both these acts of kindness more than made up for the bad lunch on the first day. Such acts of friendliness endeared us to both Mostapha and Hassan, and were not part of the package. the highlight was the camel ride from the Camp Mohayut to the sand dunes desert berber tent! What an adventure for us two senior citizens aged 70! The sand dunes of Erg Chebbi are not to be missed! Well worth the long 550kms drive from Marrakech! The dinner was very good as was the company of international travellers in our group fro this segment for the trip. On the way to the desert, while drivi g, our driver Hassan took full advantage of the 4x4 car and took us off road for long periods. We were able to visit and desert camp made by Berber nomads and see their basic, rustic life-style and how they make their living rearing goats, etc. back at the sand dunes camp, sunset and sunrise were sights to behold! After dinner entertainment was provided by our three camelguides/cook through playing drums around a bonfire on the sand dunes. Lying on our back viewing the bright stars on a cold winter night was an experience of a lifetime!Thanks, Camelsafaries, and Mostapha and safe driving Hassan, for giving us such a wonderful experience! Would highly recommend this company for guided tours in Morocco."

It started off quite poorly admittedly as they were late (around 30 mins?) to pick us up from the airport in Fes. However, it was uphill from there, which is not something that can be said for most tours that we have been on. They were friendly, tried their best to explain things to us and ensured that my wife and I were well-taken care of.

            "review": "Mesmerising Maroc. This was the second time we hired the services of Mohammed from Camel Safaries. Just like last year, our trip fell nothing short of 5 star service from them. During our recent trip (25th Nov to 6th Dec), we had our expectations met and had many surprises throughout our time in magical Maroc. Our trip started from Asilah, a town on the northwest tip of the Atlantic coast of Morocco where we stayed at Riad Tabia, hosted by the very hospitable Adil and his wife, Juri. The next day, we took a day trip to Tanger where we visited Hercules Cave, one of the most popular tourist attractions which is set along the Atlantic ocean. Mohammed then introduced us to our down-to-earth guide, Mr Murad who, by the way is a fit and charming 71 year old man! We explored the bustling medina including the fish market where the friendly fishmongers were more than happy to have their photos taken. Subsequently, we proceeded to Midelt, a town in central Morocco, in the high plains between the Middle Atlas and High Atlas mountain ranges so you can imagine how cold it was then. The journey was about 5 to 6 hours drive but with a cool driver like Mohammed, you can expect a smooth and safe ride. We stopped by many scenic spots recommended by Mohammed where we took countless photos of the welcoming locals, beautiful scenery and cute flocks of sheep during our drives throughout our stay in Morocco. We also made a quick stop in Meknes before reaching the endless sand dunes in Merzouga, which was our second visit to this calm, terracotta plains. Mohammed also brought us to the busy market in Rissani, a small town nearby where you can shop for cheap souvenirs like scarves and local wares and be awed by the everyday scenes you will probably not experience back home. Dades was our next stop where you can expect many kasbahs peppered along both sides of the long and winding road. There are many small hotels or what they call auberge where you can spend the night and, they serve the most excellent dinners like the one we put up in called Hotel Babylon Dades. The staff there were awesome and they teamed up with Mohammed that night to put up an upbeat performance with their local drums. The next morning, Mohammed drove us up to the highest point in Dades where we saw the most stunning view of the picturesque valley. It would be unthinkable to stare down the steep terrains for long but I assure you it is worth the trip up there. On our way to Ourzazate, we stopped by Boutghrar Dades, a rough and rocky patch where we were greeted with excited children who were pleased with the sweets we brought them. Mohammed brought us to yet another delightful place called Kasbah Itrane for lunch where we enjoyed a breathtaking view of the surrounding greenery. In Ourzazate, we stayed at the comfortable Dar Chamma, which had a cosy courtyard for you to laze the afternoon away as you indulge in your favourite book. The next city, Taroudant was simply magnificent as the place we stayed at, Riad El Aissi, was one huge place with a sprawling yard for you to take many beautiful photos and enjoy the outdoors in the lush garden. Here, we managed to explore the medina where we came across the varied local stuff from fruits to clothing to jewellery before we found ourselves in Agadir the following day while we were on our way to Essaouria. Essaouria, also known as Wind City has a pristine beach ideal for surfers and beach-goers. You can get delectable seafood and many colourful trinkets for family and friends as the medina in this town is very easy to walk around in and I'm sure you won't mind getting lost there! After two days, we headed to Marrakech for the night where you should visit the energetic Jamaa el Fna in Marrakesh's medina quarter. We ended the memorable trip when Mohammed dropped us off at Casablanca. I would highly recommend Camel Safaries to anyone who would like to visit Morocco as they are reliable and more importantly that they try their best to suit your travel plans to ensure that you experience the best of Maroc."

With plenty of intetesting stops and breaks along the way to keep us entertained always taking us to the more authentic than tourist location which was also the ethos for the whole trip.In the afternoon we arrived at the edge of the desert to a even better kasbah hotel to wash, have a drink, use the super good wifi and leave our bags overnight before embarking on our camels for the trek to our camp in the desert, also they sell beer and wine at the kasbah before you leave and bring it for you in a cool box to the dessert camp (nice touch) we got on our camels and were led across the dessert with plenty of photo oppertunites and also watched the sunset as well before we arrived to our camp for tea and dinner, drinks, music and good convosation! We choose to bring out matresses outside and sleep under the best view of the stars I have ever seen!Day 3: back on the camels to the kasbah for a lovely breakfast, shower etc to depart on the drive back to Merrakech, quite a drive to be honest but a nice touch on the way was stopping at a great little italian place becuase to be honest Ali knew we would be bored of tajines! they drove us to the hotel and yeah just have woken up to write him a review!I could highly recommened this tour so worth every penny they we great and you should book!Thanks to Ali, Hassan, Paul & Joy and Ki x"

I did the 2 day tour with my girlfriend, where we had our own Berber guide, Hassan, drive us through beautiful landscapes down to Zagora. It is a very full on day, but it goes quickly. When we finally arrived at the camels, it was a beautiful ride through the desert to the accommodation. Our camel guide, Ibrahim, is a total dude! Super friendly and welcoming as well as patient. I must recommend that when riding a camel, you should wear tight fitting trousers, and ask for more blankets if you are lacking a posterior..... It will rub (maybe even bring a pillow, I'm not kidding) Regardless of this, it was still awesome!! The accommodation in the desert is also brilliant. Our tent had proper beds and electricity, and they also provided soap and clean towels. The site had flushing toilets and showers, so it was much appreciated. The site can accommodate many many tourists, but there was only us two on this tour. They made us feel so welcome and we had such a laugh trying to learn Arabic and Berber. The highlight was all of us having a jam on their drums. I'm a drummer for a living, so it was an absolute joy!! Ali in the office is also very quick in responding to emails and it is run very efficiently. Highly recommended!! :-)"

The hotels were spectacular with comfortable beds and extra facilities to enjoy more after long journeys as well as the restaurant and places who recommend in our way to taste the typical food from the different regions. I just can say, that I could not be happier after these days and I highly recommend to travel with camel safaries to everyone! Thank you so much Hassan and Ali for this awesome adventure!"

            "review": "Wonderful Experience with Mohammed Maazouz of Camel Safaries. My friends and I (a group of 5) visited Morocco for the first time in early September 2015. One of my friends booked the tour with Camel Safaries so I had zero expectations, but I was very surprised and satisfied with our tour with Camel Safaries and appreciated experiencing Morocco with an excellent private tour guide.OUR TOUR AND EXPERIENCEWe did the 4 days/3 nights tour from Marrakech through the Atlas Mountains to the Sahara Desert which was customizable according to our interests. Mohammed Maazouz served as both our driver and tour guide, who was exceptional (more on him later in my review). The varied landscape from Marrakech out towards the Sahara desert is extremely beautiful, and made all the better with Mohammed providing background to the landscape features and rural towns. The anti-Atlas mountain range on our drive back to Marrakech were incredibly breathtaking - flat land pocketed by low trees and shrubs juxtaposed with unique rock formations. The camel riding and camping in the desert is a nice experience, but the less \"touristy\" parts of the tour were the most memorable. We did experience a sand storm during our camel ride out to the desert camp, so come prepared with a buff or scarf to cover your face. One of the highlights of our tour was being invited to a day-before-the-wedding celebration lunch. Mohammed knew the family and it was such a fun experience to be \"one of the locals\" by eating a wonderful meal with a large gathering of friends and family members. We were clearly foreigners but were treated like one of the normal guests. My favorite part of our trip was interacting and spending some time with a nomad family. Mohammed seemed to know her and her young children personally and it was a very eye-opening experience learning how a typical nomad family lives. The meals were great - some were pretty touristy, but at the same time, those of us who had weaker stomachs appreciated those places. My favorite meal though, was eating at a local restaurant (packed and not a tourist in sight!) on our last day on the long drive back to Marrakech. I'm a vegetarian but ended up eating the beef meatballs and lamb chops to experience a true Moroccan meal. Other activities we did, that I'd recommend: visiting Mohammed's family's date tree stand in an oasis, walking around Ait Ben Haddou (a UNESCO World Heritage Site), and visiting the local market and eating fresh figs. I could have done without the visit to the Pigeons du Sable and the argan oil co-op visit, which I felt were tourist traps.OUR GUIDE, MOHAMMED MAAZOUZI don't think I can do Mohammed justice in this review. Mohammed has a way of making people feel very comfortable and welcomed. He has a calming personality and is very knowledgeable, as a tour guide should be. I don't know how Mohammed does it, but he drove for hours and hours in the company's Toyota Land Cruiser, and my group and I always felt safe. Despite the fact that he hosts a number of tours throughout the year, he really does treat your group like you're special. I never felt like simply a paycheck for him. Mohammed also seemed to care about our lives and interests and was patient in answering our seemingly endless questions about the Berber culture and people. I truly believe that having Mohammed as our tour guide really made our trip and cannot recommend him enough. LAST THOUGHTSIt ended up being a really great and memorable trip. The takeaway is that the tour can be completely tailored to your interests. You don't have to do anything you don't feel like doing. Mohammed always gave us options and asked us where we wanted to go next. I would recommend selecting the higher level accommodations/hotel stays so you are thoroughly comfortable on the trip. Also, make sure you have enough dirham before you leave the big city; there were only a few ATMs along the way in the rural towns and villages. Camel Safaries is a solid choice for a tour guide company and well priced. I believe having a guide, especially if it is your first visit to Morocco, is essential to not only experiencing but learning about and understanding the rich history, beautiful places, and the varied people of Morocco."

When I first found Ali online in 2006, when I led my first small group to Morocco, I had no idea what I would find when I met him and signed on for a tour. All these years later, I can say from my heart that Ali is simply the best--at every level. Guide, friend, and like family to me--Ali has gently guided my groups on 12 different 16- to 21-day trips through the country he knows so well. Intelligent, kind, knowledgable, and professional, Ali is the best guide imaginable. Although it is difficult for me to be objective after all this time, I can't imagine being in better hands than with Ali and his crew. Funny, unflappable, able to problem solve on the spot, he is able to offer custom designed trips and tours of any length or price point, Ali can create a perfect journey, a perfect way to experience the incredible culture and people of Morocco. I can't offer enough praise or assign enough stars to recommend this amazing young man and his company.As I said...my guide, my friend, my family."

My son and my sister and I booked this trip just knowing that we wanted to say that we had ridden camels in the Moroccan desert - not many people get that opportunity. What we weren't counting on were the awe inspiring vistas as we drove through the Atlas Mountains, the visions of the Berbers as they went along the streets with their happy faces, the beautiful (and not so beautiful) villages along the way. But most of all, the generosity and hospitality of our guide, Ali, during the Eid Al-Adha celebrations, who welcomed us into his home, giving us an experience we could never replicate. His professionalism and warmth at a time of great tragedy in his family is something that will stay with us forever. Thank you, Ali, and thank you Mohammed for delivering us safely back to Marrakech. If it wasn't for this tour, we may have had a very different opinion of Morocco (having only experienced the madness of Marrakech to that point), but now we can't recommend it highly enough."

Firstly, having a guide who is Morroccan is a huge advantage in getting to understand the country, the people and their culture. Secondly, Mohammed is incredibly pleasant to spend time with, always keen to answer and discuss any and all our questions (which we had plenty of), very informative and his English is excellent. We particularly appreciated his kind and generous invitation to share in his family's celebration of Aid-al-Adha, a once in a lifetime experience. In addition, the itinerary covered everything we wanted/needed to see, and suited us really well. The Land Rover was very comfortable. We'd highly recommend the Riad Madu tents in the desert.Thanks to Mohammed, we had an unforgettable experience in Morocco. Also, the payment process through GetYourGuide was seamless (another company asked for a Western Union transfer, which was more difficult)."

The camel ride was good fun, and when we were in the camp, we really had the impression of being in the middle of the desert, as it is well organised within the area of the dunes. It made us want to come back and enjoy a longer desert tour next time round."

In preparation for our trip to Morocco, I read countless reviews and asked for quotations from multiple tour companies for a 3 day/2 night camel tour from Fes-Marrakech. In the end, I am so pleased we chose Camel Safaries. The company was responsive via email and very clear as to what the itinerary would entail. What we didn't know is that we would be cared for by Mohammed, an intelligent, funny and very likeable guide who made the trip the highlight of our 2 weeks in Morocco. Sure, the overnight camel excursion was once-in-a lifetime, and sure the Gorges were breathtaking, and the apes were fun. But to see this part of the country in only 3 days requires very long days in the car- and with Mohammed it was more than just bearable, it was a rich experience. He was very knowledgable on everything Moroccan, and quickly figured out what we would find interesting. Happily, the 4x4 was comfortable, air conditioned and well- equipped. Each morning Mohammed ensured that the windows were so clean that I could take perfect pictures from inside the car! And our best times were stopping along the way in small towns to have a local meal with the locals, or sharing a 'Berber whiskey' with a nomad family. We can't say enough about the experience- thanks to the professionals at Camel Safaries."

Before we came to Morocco, we went to Tanzania, that is an amazing country too, but because of Mohammed,I so often dreamed of Morocco . Mohammed took us to lots of places, Casa, Marrakesh, the small village(Moulay Brahim) in Atlas mountains, Merzouga, Erg Chebbi, and then he drove us to Essaouira to attend the Gnawa Festival. Mohammed is not only a guide but also a friend, he took lots beautiful pics for us, and every place we drove to, he told lots of histories and stories about Morocco for us. Although sometimes drove more than 10 hours, but he always made us happy and enjoy every minute. He is a very devout Muslims, is so kind and friendly. He knew so much information about his country. We can feel his love to Morocco. He is so kind, sometimes we went through the poor village, he always stoped the car, and gave some sweets or fruits to the kids. He is so patient to every person. At last, I must to say, he is a very very good driver. Thank u so much, Mohammed, you made these days special! It is the best memories for us.

I think that says it all about this company and their guides-- they'll go out of the way to give you the very best experience of Morocco.I pride myself on being an independent traveler, and this is the first time I've ever used a tour guide to see a foreign country. I would recommend taking a tour with Camel Safaries no matter what! You see so much more than you would on your own and having a local guide with you who speaks the language and knows the customs opens up a whole new world of experiences. The price is very reasonable when you consider that it includes accommodation, most meals and attractions, and a 24/7 tour guide."

His glowing charisma with the local Moroccans we met along the way allowed us as visitors to engage with the country and the culture outside the normal confines of the tourism industry. From mint tea with local oasis farmers to real Moroccan BBQ and freshly-picked figs, Mohammed went above and beyond to introduce us to the best things Morocco has to offer. It was powerfully clear that Mohammed takes great pride in both his country and in showing it to the travelers of the world. Mohammed is also highly skilled. He speaks excellent English and, as a driver, is a paradigm of cool, calm, and collected. We felt very safe in his hands.Before our tour even ended, my girlfriend and I were talking of a return trip to Morocco in the future, and if we do so, it will certainly be with Camel Safaries."

Mohammed was an amazing guide. He was kind, helpful and friendly, but above all he was a absolute wealth of knowledge regarding all things to do with Morocco. His knowledge of the history of the country was outstanding and this combined with his geographical knowledge meant that we learnt so much in 3 days. My son even came away saying he had learnt more from Mohammed than he had learnt in the past year in history and geography lessons at school! Mohammed's ease at sharing his knowledge was also a real gift.As to his driving skills, we felt completely safe the whole time. We did experience one difficult situation, when because of an accident in a village that we were supposed to travel through, the only alternative was to cross a fast flowing river. Both Mohammed's judgement skills and his driving skills paid off here as after considering the options carefully, he drove us over the river with no difficulty.Camel Safaris had also arranged a super hotel at the edge of the desert for the first night of the tour.

But then you add how genuinely friendly he is, how patient with kids, how flexible, how prompt, his great driving (particularly on the crazy back roads of the Atlas Mountains), the relationships he's built up with locals, and how solicitous and helpful he is all the time without fail... well my goodness. Our tour with him was just superb. We had 4 nights and 5 days on the tour - started in Marrakech, then down to the desert, then a drop off in Fez. The amazing thing is that it all took place smack in the middle of Ramadan. I.e., the guy was up at 3:30 am for prayers, then no food or drink all day. I kept waiting for him to show some level of irritability brought on by physical discomfort, but he was unfailingly kind and helpful throughout. One of the things he told us was how right behavior, including how you perform at your job, is an important piece of being a good Muslim. Muhammed walks this talk.PS - one of our daughters forgot her Kindle in his car. They're shipping it back to us, no charge. This company is a class act."

My boyfriend and I were blown away with the incredible experience we were offered by Camel Safaris when we booked to travel with them from Marrakech to Fez over the course of three days in July 2015. Good friends had highly recommended that we travel through Morocco with this particular company as they had also had a unique and memorable experience back in 2012.We we treated with great care and professionalism right from the initial correspondence with Ali which was prompt and hugely informative as he guided us through the many and varied options available. It was clear that the itinerary could be flexible and was absolutely tailored to our spec of dates and interests. We even made a last minute amendment to the start date of our tour which Ali actioned with immediate effect and zero fuss. He was a true pleasure to book through as we felt more and more secure that this was indeed THE company to tour with. The A/C 4x4's are comfortable and spacious and felt like our own space for three days.... and then we met Mohammed - the wonderful, personable, conscientious driver who would be hosting our tour which further fueled our excitement to get going. Ali had arranged for Mohammed to visit us at our Riad a couple of nights before beginning our tour to answer any questions and tell us a little more about his proposed itinerary.Once again, from initial meeting to the big hugs at the end of the trip, Mohammed was kind, consistently careful on the roads, informative and overall incredibly personable, genuinely ensuring that we had a hugely special experience. Our highlight was camel trekking to spend a night out in the desert, and watching the sun rise over the Sahara the following morning which was unforgettable.I work within the service industry, and recognise the importance of both positive feedback and constructive criticism, however I quite honestly could not fault Camel Safaris in any single way. Mohammed is a gem, as I'm sure the rest of Ali's team are, and I would 100% recommend Camel Safaris to any other lucky travellers who have the opportunity to explore Morocco. Ultimate care and comfort is what they offer - you will not be disappointed!"

Mohammed my tour guide really went above and beyond to make sure that my needs were satisfied, he even upgraded my hotel because he could tell I needed a good sleep and comfort. I loved how the tour was private as I still has a say in everything I did, which I really liked. I highly recommend using this tour operator."

We brought my Mom, my sister, and my Mom's best friend and my wife's cousin (also Moroccan) along for the trip. We all had a blast! The trip showcased some of the most beautiful places in Morocco. It never felt \"touristy\". My wife and cousin loved it, too - they saw parts of Morocco they'd never been to and said it was a fantastic experience. Mohammed Maazouz was our guide - and he was fantastic. His English and manners are impeccable. The hotels included in the package were very very nice (it can be hard to find great hotels in Morocco). One of my favorite memories of the trip was Mohammed entertaining us with a traditional story during one of the drives between locations.This is by far the best way to see Morocco. I highly recommend the experience."

Our guide Mohammed was extremely knowledgeable, upbeat, and competent; he answered every question we could think of, kept us entertained, and educated us about his country. We drove around to many small towns and interesting stopping points and consequently were able to see so much more of the country than just the bigger cities. All of the accommodation, food, etc. was absolutely on-point and I had absolutely no complaints there. The camel trek out into the desert was such a cool experience, and we were completely taken care of the entire trip. I would highly recommend this tour company."

He answered all of our questions about any thing. So informed on Moroccos history and obviously its culture. He spoke brilliant english, constantly made sure we were comfortable and well hydrated. The drive is long but the stops along the way are breath taking. Driving to the peak of the high Atlas Mountains (second tallest mountain peak in Africa!) was a once in a life time experience. When we stopped for lunch were also able to tour at a beautiful Kasbah in which many movies and tv shows were filmed. We arrived late to our camels but the guides there were very accommodating. Our camel guide was excellent and even shared some of his fruit and local foods when we stopped briefly for a desert picnic so he could break his fast. The camp site was well maintained, safe, and comfortable. Our meals were very nice and following dinner we had a great time playing music and hanging out with the guides and other visitors on different camel treks (ours was the best). Mohammed was available for any thing we needed the entire time, even in the evenings at the camp site, he was honest and thoughtful and the entire adventure was well organized. We were sad to say goodbye but it was a two day experience that will stay with us for a life time."

            "review": "Amazing adventures with Camel Safaries!. As two young American women traveling alone in a foreign country, we were a bit worried about choosing the right tour guides for our time in the desert of Morocco. Lucky for us, we chose wisely... and had the most incredible time!!! Everything was well organized and laid back. Our guides, Anass and Ali, showed us an amazing time. From our pick up in Marrakech, through the Atlas Mountains to the Sahara desert, and then on to Fes. Of our ten days in Morocco, the 4 days we spent with Camel Safaries stand out above the rest of the trip. 100%.We booked a 2 night, 3 day tour (with only one night in the desert). After the first day, we knew we had to extend it! Camel Safaries was super flexible in letting us add on an extra day with no problem... and we were SO glad we did. We spent an extra day with them and our 4x4 driver, Mohammed, who was so much fun!!! By the end of day 2 & 3, we felt like we were exploring the desert with old friends, truly. Our guide Ali, took us to his family's house to have lunch on the way to the desert, which was an unexpected surprise. They were so wonderful about answering our MANY questions about their culture, religion, and way of life in Morocco. The night spent in the desert was wonderful- but I will say we didn't have the best circumstances. It was a full moon, so it was difficult to see many stars (be sure to plan your night in the desert around the moon!). Otherwise, it was wonderful. On our 4x4 day with Mohammed, he drove us to what seemed like the middle of nowhere in the Sahara and we stopped for a game of volleyball, while camels watched us in the distance. We then found the only tree around, where they made us a picnic lunch and impromptu fire (despite the heat of the sun!). Another one of our favorite moments.They also connected us with a nomad family in the Sahara desert, who we spent an afternoon with. Their way of life was fascinating! So fascinating, that we decided to come back later for dinner with them (after they kindly invited us). That dinner was one of the most memorable travel experiences I've ever had. Mohammed drove us through the desert back to their nomad hut, and we brought them the food supplies to cook dinner. We then went to have something to drink and watch the sunset in the desert with the guides while we waited for them to cook our dinner. That time was very special. Once we returned to the nomad's house it was dark... the only light being the full moon. Mohammed brought candles that we placed around the room we would eat in- which made the entire meal feel like a family holiday. We ate by candlelight with the nomads and had the most unique and wonderful experience with them. They even invited us to spend the night in their hut, but we sadly had to leave early the next morning for Fes. I really cannot say enough great things about Camel Safaries. We were so lucky to have found them... and have continued to be in touch, as they became our friends. If you're looking for a unique experience with wonderful guides... these are your guys!"

Throughout the whole trip, he was extremely willing to share his knowledge on Morocco. Anas went the extra mile in ensuring that we had a great time. For example, near the end of our trip, he called an international number to ensure that someone from our riad was able to pick us up so we wouldn\u2019t get lost in the medina. As well, we really wanted sandwiches during lunch and Anas made that possible for us. Though Anas was fasting, he was still flawless in his work. He hiked all the way up Ait Benhaddou to show us the way when it was extremely hot outside."

Over 12 days we worked with Mohammed, Ali (Africa!) and Hassan - along with top notch local guides. So happy with a late ferry and no way to contact them - to see their smiling faces to begin our tour and be taken to Chefchaouene. Such a magical town and one of our favorites. Ali and Hassan picked us up and started the tour. They were energetic, fun and quite knowledgeable. Not too many tourists have chicken rotisserie in Menkes with the locales - they brought n authentic twist to an \"organized tour.\" In Fez we were picked up by Mohammed. Off to his hometown in the desert. In addition to our camel trip to the luxury tent camp, we had lunch (homemade) with his family. Our best lunch of the trip. He was very accommodating- along the way their was Fantasia in a local town and he was willing to pull over spontaneously so we could see it. At the end in Marrakech, our room was unbelievable and so romantic. Great way to celebrate my birthday. We left feeling we have a friendship with Mohammed - he truly cared and aimed to keep us happy.

Muhammad was very kind and accommodating as he tried his utmost best to cater to our needs and requests. There was never a dull moment throughout our trip as he patiently brought us from one city to another, letting us have a taste of Moroccan life and its rich culture as we met the friendly locals and even a family in the Merzouga desert. We were captivated by the countless beautiful sights during our long drives from one city to another and were always awed by the stories Muhammad shared about magnificent Morocco. We got to see breathtaking landscapes, scenic deserts, the ever-so-cool Atlas Mountains, colourful medinas with the endless arrays of things we never knew existed, the charming Todra Gorge and lots more that you've got to see for yourself. Make Morocco your 2015 holiday and make sure you book your trip with Camel Safaries!"

A quick note: we are frequent international travelers who have never gone on an organized tour before. When we travel, we usually do a bunch of research, rent a car, and go at it on our own. After reading the reviews of Camel Safaris (and not speaking a word of Berber or Arabic, and only a few words of French), booking a tour seemed prudent, and I'm so glad we did!Ali helped arrange everything ahead of time, and his emails were always very prompt and friendly. Mohammed picked us up in Fes, and we liked him from the start. He's super smart, polite, charming, and obviously loves his country. We had such a great time talking to him about the customs, religion, food, politics, favorite soccer teams, etc. The tour itself was fantastic, too - we fed monkeys in a cedar forest, rode camels into the desert and spent the night in a Berber tent, toured an underground well, visited an ancient kasbah, drove through the most beautiful gorges and oases, and ate the best food in roadside cafes with not a tourist in sight. The hotel where we stayed in Ouarzazete was gorgeous, and the desert hotel where we cleaned up after the desert camping was great, too (we had booked the mid-level accommodation level and were blown away that both weren't considered 'luxury'). The whole trip really avoided anything overtly touristy-feeling (camel-riding is inherently touristy, but it was *awesome* and a bucket-list thing for us). I kept thinking how happy I was that we'd chosen this tour to really get a feel of the countryside (and make a new Moroccan friend in Mohammed). Had we just visited the big cities on our trip to Morocco, it would have completely transformed the vacation. We never would have learned so much about the culture and experienced the country's rural beauty without Camel Safaris; skipping the tour would have been a huge mistake! I highly recommend this company and the experience it provides."

Many roads were broken and impassable. We had to reschedule and change our itinerary, often at the last minute. Ali and his team were fully accommodating, sending us information and suggesting alternatives, all with our safety in mind. My email chain with Ali reached almost 40 long messages back-&-forth. In the end, by delaying our trip by 4 days so that the roads could be repaired, and doing our trip in reverse (Fes -> Sahara -> Marrakesh), we had a successful trip.Youssef (pronounced yu-su) was our guide. He was an excellent driver, especially given that many of the roads we traversed were covered in pot-holes, partially washed away, or even covered by a surging river (we had to wait for the water to subside for that one.) We never felt unsafe with Youssef at the wheels.Seeing the Sahara sunrise is bucket-list worthy, and is now one of my favorite things ever. Sandboarding down the dunes and riding the camels were also super fun. If you visit Morocco, don't hesitate about making the long trip to the Sahara, and if you do, Camel Safaries is a terrific choice."

            "review": "'wow- What a Trip!'. We travelled to Morocco with our 2 teenage boys to have a bit of an adventure. We had 11 days to fit in an awful lot and travel a long way! Having read the reviews for Camel Safaries we decided to see if Ali could come up with an Itinerary to suit our needs in the time frame allowed. Not only did he come up with everything we asked for but the price was affordable and included everything except our drinks and lunches. We had a Toyota 4x4 driven by Ibrahim our very happy (and safe) driver and Mustapha our guide who was the font of all knowledge (answering our thousands of questions ),who was very courteous, amenable and spoke great English. They both had a great sense of humour which suited our family down to the ground! We stayed in a variety of beautiful old Riads along the way,all slightly different but lovely and the food was always great.We did a camel ride and an overnight stay in Berber tents in the desert..that night we had the best Tagine of the whole trip followed by a drum party and the boys had a go on sandboards down the dunes as the sun went down..what a great night! The guys hired brand new quad bikes the next day and had the time of their lives riding through the dunes and back to our Riad for a candlelit supper under the trees!We saw the most spectacular scenery on our 3 day journey to the coast which was continually changing and quite breathtaking. We stopped whenever we liked to stretch our legs and take photos and always had a nice lunch somewhere en route. Our final few days were spent in Essaouira, surfing,paddleboarding, relaxing and horseriding. Ali sought out a lovely quiet surf beach not too far away as a suggested option and made sure we could hire boards there, the waves were massive and we had a fantastic time. As we had 3 nights in the same hotel Ali had arranged that we only ate at the hotel for one and got to go and experience other fantastic restaurants that served seafood on the other 2 nights..that was brilliant and so thoughtful. Having Mustapha with us gave us the chance to go to places and see things we would't have done had we driven ourselves and we learnt so much about life in Morocco from him. We really got a taste of the local culture,which is just what we had wanted and all learnt to say a few things in Arabic/Berber which the locals seemed to enjoy.. We all give Ali and his team a massive thumbs up and thank you for making our trip everything we hoped for and more."

            "review": "Good Experience. We did the five days/four nights from Marrakesh to Fez with our three children ages 11-16. Everything was very well organized and Hassan our guide was very friendly and upbeat with the kids. We especially liked meeting his friend in his home town who gave us a tour of the market and played a bit of soccer with our girls. The camel trek and staying in the Berber tent exceeded our expectations.This is a pretty straightforward tour so expect to see other tours following the same path as you. The exception is one day where you do go off the beaten path to see the Berbers in the caves which was very interesting and a lot of driving that day, but getting off the beaten path frequently is. The mid range places were nicer than I expected, but also larger (less intimate) than I expected. There is a lot of ground to cover in a short amount of time so there is a lot of driving almost every day (4.5-7hrs a day) which limited our spontaneous exploring. If you can take longer and break it up more, I highly suggest it. The breakfasts and dinners were all very good. Lunch options were limited bc it was Ramadan, but instead of hot sit down lunches of tagine and kebobs at usually more than 10USD per person, picking up fresh foods like bread, cheese, and tomotoes from local markets would have been preferable, but less available bc of the timing. Overall, this is a solid choice, well organized and well priced."

Our guide and driver Mohammed picked us up in a new 4x4 which was perfect for driving through the Atlas Mountains. He is experienced and we felt very comfortable with his driving. He was also very knowledgable about pretty much everything and always kept us entertained with stories and facts about what we were seeing.The overnight stay in the dessert was far more luxurious than I had expected. There are showers, running water and the tents even have beds and furniture. The only downside is that we found the dishes a bit dirty. All in all I highly reccommend them because we felt very well taken after and enjoyed every minute of the tour."

We couldn't say better things about our guide and driver Youssef who was kind, friendly and knowledgeable (and a very safe driver!). It was also great to have a guide from the Erg Chebbi/Merzouga region who knew the area very well. We stayed at great hotels for the duration of our trip and Ali was very accommodating during our trip planning and to last minute itinerary changes we wanted to make (while we were already on day 2 of our trip). We were never rushed and had the flexibility to visit anything we were interested in (or skip anything we weren't). The price that Ali quoted us from the beginning was reasonable and while on arrival guides were eager to offer us a lower price, we found comfort in paying a little extra for safety, reliability and comfort throughout our trip. (Others we met who traveled with other companies/guides varied greatly when it came to their experiences and satisfaction with their trips and accommodations) I would absolutely recommend camel safaries (and our guide Yousef!) to anyone visiting Morocco. PS I would recommend a 4 day vs. a 3 night trip as you will be doing a lot of driving and having the day to rest in Merzouga prior to our overnight desert camping was a wonderful break!"

We appreciated the promptness and flexibility that Ali and the company showed to helping us design our itinerary. Our primary guide and driver was Ibrahim. He was a careful and SAFE driver, had a great sense of humor, was supportive of our photography focus, and like Ali in the head office, he was flexible and worked hard to get us to the places that we wanted to go. He was a fount of information about the desert and about the customs of Berber people. We loved hearing his stories about his family's partial transition from desert nomadism to settled town life, and were amazed at his musical talents as well. We also arranged a transfer from Marrakech to Casablanca Airport with a stop at the Hassan II mosque. Our driver on that day was Ali (not the same as Ali the owner), and he was also very friendly, and we really enjoyed learning from him about the history of Morocco and the Berber people. Our impression is that Camel Safaris is a great company that it is continuing to improve. Director Ali checked in with his drivers every day, and both he and the drivers sincerely asked us for feedback/constructive criticism. We do not know if we will return to Morocco in the near future, but if we do we will gladly work with Camel Safaris again!Will Betz and Debbie Williamson"

In each large city Ali had a local expert give us a 1/2 day tour and it was great getting facts and hearing stories from those who have lived in those cities. After visits to Todas Gorge, Ouarzazate, Essaouira and back to Marrakech, every day was full of activity but with plenty of wonderful stops for tea. I would recommend Camel Safaries for any group whether it be a single, couple, family or group of friends."

I would recommend taking the three or four day tour if you do this trip because from what I was told, the large dunes are majestic.

After a few months of trip planning and research, we decided to hire a local touring company for the section of Atlas and central Morocco. I contacted Camel&Safaries based on the good reviews at the TripAdvisor for their quality services provided. Ali patiently worked with me to customize the itinerary to fulfill my wish list. He was very responsive to all my questions. We booked a 4 day 3 night Atlas, central Morocco, desert and Volubilis tour, started from Marrakech and ended at Meknes. Camel&Safaries provided a nine seat Mercedi-Benz van, a driver (Anazis) and a tour guid (Mohammed) With all the luggages, we could still seated comfortably in the car for 4 days. Both the guide and driver were very knowledgeable and informative. They not only answered all our questions, but also enlightened us with their living cultures by their personal/family stories. We had many laughs and shared stories of cultural differences. It was like a family vacation. At the end of the tour and before dropping us at our hotel in Meknes, Mohammed had gone out of his way to arrange a private car for us taking us to Fez the next day afternoon. It was a comfortable ride at a reasonable price. In a summary, the quality of the inclusive services, accommodations and meals in this tour was beyond our expectations. We had a wonderful time in Morocco; the tour with Camel&Safaries was one of the major tributes to this memorable experience. The lunches were not included in the tour package. The restaurants Mohammed took us for lunches were very touristy; especially the one in Meknes was pricy and not good. Camel&Safaries may check out other restaurants for better selections."

It was fantastic!Our second night we enjoyed in the desert. Unfortunately it was overcast, it actually rained (!), so we did not get either a great sunset or sunrise or a great view of the stars. However, we had a good time with the other 9 guests telling stories and listening to the Berber music provided by our hosts. Tents were comfortable. We had a hotel room back at the base where we started from and were able to leave most of our belongings there.Mohammed arranged for Berber pizza the next day which my husband has said was the best food he had. We saw so much that it is impossible to go into detail. I would trust Mohammed and his Uncle who owns the company to look into and help with any arrangements you want. At our request Mohammed also made arrangements for a guides in the Medina for both Marrekesh and Fes. Which we highly recommend.We likely won't be back in Morocco soon - as there are other places we want to see - but if I was going I would definitely book through Camel Safaries."

His drivers are also excellent--always helpful, courteous, and careful on the road. Ali can put together whatever kind of trip you would like, for whatever budget you have. If I could give him ten stars, I would!"

It was an amazing experience and highly recommended. Our guide and driver were amazing and became good friends by the end. Mohammed knew the answer to every question we threw at him and always gave more details about anything you wanted. Ali organized everything for us and even accommodated our special request to end the tour in a different city. We did the budget accommodation and it was fantastic. The tour was beyond what we were expecting and I can't recommend it highly enough. It was an amazing way to see all the different aspects of Morocco when we were just travelling there for a short time."

Ali from Camel Safaries arranged everything, from transportation to accommodation to activities and planned everything according to our tastes. He even went above and beyond and took us to see his family and house as well as stayed up late with us to stargaze on the sahara desert sands. One of our travelers was vegetarian and Ali was very helpful in finding us restaurants we could all enjoy. Through him, we also befriended several locals who I still keep in touch with and whom gave us a local's perspective on life in Morocco. In a country where you might expect some hiccups during travel, this trip was completely worry-free and went so smoothly because Ali and our driver, Youssef, handled everything. The people at Camel Safaries are not just professionals at what they do, but they are good people. By the end of our trip, we all become good friends. We enjoyed a one-of-a-kind experience and I will always have fond memories of Morocco thanks to Camel Safaries."

            "review": "Great experience with Camel Safaries!. An overdue review. Back in Sept 2011, we took a custom 5 day trip to Morocco. Ali was our primary contact in arranging the custom tour and was always helpful and responsive along the way.Our driver for the entire trip was Brahim. Picked us up upon arrival in Casablanca and headed straight towards Fez with a stop in Meknes. We met a local guide in Meknes for a 2 hour tour of town, then into Fez. We spent 1.5 days in Fez (with a terrific female local guide -- since we were 2 girls travelling, it was fascinating to ask her about life in Morocco). We also enjoyed our stop at a ceramics factory in Fez (may have been a bit touristy, but the ceramics were beautiful and nicer quality than ones we found elsewhere). We then continued on to Marrakesh for 3 days, meeting a local guide there as well. We took a one day excursion to Essaouira for a change of scenery and it was nice to escape the heat and chaos Marrakesh. Flew out of Marrakesh. Camel safaries provided all transportation and transfers. The restaurants they took us to were good (perhaps not outstanding), but the last night in Marrakesh we really enjoyed dinner at a more modern, less touristy restaurant outside of the kasbah walls -- near the post office downtown. It was a nicer place with modern takes on Moroccan flavors. Unfortunately I can't remember the name... but you should ask your driver for alternative options with dining when you start to get tired of the same old tagines and pastillas and cous cous, which we ate for the first 4 days of the trip.We stayed in great riads (see my other reviews) booked through Camel Safaries.Overall, Camel Safaries was great. They required only a deposit upon booking (via Western Union) and we paid the balance in cash in person at the conclusion of our tour (so be prepared to carry a lot of cash throughout the tour).The only downside -- we were focused on meeting Brahim at the Casablanca airport upon arrival and neglected to get local currency from the ATM right away, thinking it would be easy to stop at an ATM along the way. Brahim was concerned about us using a rural ATM on a Sunday in case there were issues with the transaction, so we didn't end up getting cash until day 3 of the trip. In the meantime, he was our personal currency exchange. This wasn't Camel Safaries' problem so much as a suggestion for other travellers to go ahead and get local currency from the ATM at the airport!"

Since we got in the car we started learning everything about Morocco, the Berbers and all the culture, Ibrahim was so informative and knowledgable. He wanted to please us in everything and made us feel as if we were his sisters. The camel ride was amazing, such an experience! And when we arrived at the bivouac we were astonished of how it was! It exceeded our expectations. The Berbers on camp were so nice, the food excellent and the accommodations more of what we could have wished for! It's totally an experience everyone has to live!

Can't speak highly enough about our experience. We saw so many things that we never would have seen if we hadn't done the trek, and everything was laid out for us. We had our own 4x4, our own driver (Hassan), and an English-speaking guide the whole way, and they really knew what they were doing, timing out every portion of the trip, hitting all of the locations that we never would have realized to go to, and even enjoying many of the sights with us, which was a huge help (especially when visiting the markets).This was a far superior way to travel relative to renting our own car, and our night camel-trekking in the desert was one of the most memorable experiences we'll ever have. I also wanted to add a note to recommend our guide, Mohamed Mazouz, who was incredible. He was incredibly engaging throughout the trip, and made my wife and I feel like family. I suggest requesting him, you won't be disappointed!Overall, I highly recommend Camel Safaries for anybody who wants to see some of Morocco outside of the main cities. It is extremely affordable, incredibly professional, and an experience that you can't get on your own."

Ali, the company owner, was exceptional with answering our numerous questions, responding to emails in a timely manner, and providing us with enough information to feel comfortable and excited for our adventure. Our tour was scheduled with Mohammed and Hamid; they were/are a great team. Each of them have their roles, Hamid, the driver was excellent. Never once did I feel unsafe or uncomfortable being a passenger in the car. Mohammed, the guide, is incredibly knowledgeable and thorough in his understanding and explanations about the various sites along the tour. His expertise is not only tour specific but any questions or curiosities asked throughout the journey Mohammed knew the answer. He is so very kind and always a gentleman. Hamid and Mohammed never rushed us and even allowed us to deviate from the scheduled sites to take in other experiences we saw along the way (a local village street market).

It was a beautiful drive into the desert, stopping along a few towns to explore and eat. The drive deeper into the desert was very hot. At one point we pulled over to chase a huge yellow lizard. It was quite fun. Once we arrived we each got into a camel and Ali put us into the care of a guide who took us into the desert sand dunes to a camp site which was already set up. There we settled in. We played music with our guide, drank wine, and the guide made us an amazing Tagine in the desert sand. The best I've had! We all decided to sleep side by side outside under the stars because the tents felt very dark. At some point in the middle of the night we saw comets and shooting starts.... We watched the sun come up and then we prepared to explore a bit before returning to meet Ali. It was amazing! I did however think, if our guide happens to drop dead, how would we leave this place??? I guess Ai would have come for us. :) It was one of the best experiences ever.... And Ali is great. Very informative, fun and accommodating."

My husband and I met Ali in Marrakesh which was a fabulous city. He showed us around, but gave us ample time to explore on our own. I don't usually take tours since I like to stumble upon things myself, but Ali provided the right mix of guidance and independence. His English is impeccable and he answered such candid questions of ours. We really got a good feel for the culture. We did a lot of driving through the Atlas Mountains to Fez, the Sahara Desert and then to Casablanca. Yosef was an excellent driver and also entertaining. We were never at a loss for words and laughed a lot. He also sang for us and answered lots of our questions. My favorite part was the camel ride in the desert and then sleeping overnight in a tent. It was just an amazing experience and so beautiful. I can't recommend them enough. It's a trip I will never forget!"

My partner Tracy and I met Ali from Camel Safaris in Marrakesh on the recommendation of a Canadian couple we had met in 2009.We both immediately liked and felt comfortable with Ali and signed up for a 5 days trip commencing the next morning.We thoroughly enjoyed the experience, being one of the highlights of a 6 mth vacation through North Africa and Europe.Ali and Yusuf ( his calm and deliberate driver) made the 5 days navigating some difficult terrain and cultural differences a breeze. There was never any moments where we felt 'obligated' to buy from a local vendor ( as had happened previously on tours) and Tracy was treated with the utmost respect and courtesy.Ali has designed his Tours extremely well. Each day is fascinating, with appropriate breaks for meals factored into the schedule. The drive from Marrakesh into the Sahara was breathtaking, my DSLR was working overtime, and meeting the woman who lives in a cave with her family was also a highlight.We are still in contact with Ali, in fact on our return to Australia a glass of Saharan sand was accidently thrown out and upon emailing Ali he sent me another bag of sand!! Now that's service.We can't recommend Camel Safaris highly enough."

            "review": "Fantastic experience with Camel Safaries. Back in 2007, we took a phenomenal 10-day tour of Morocco. We found Ali Oussou through a posting on TripAdvisor, and he subsequently sent me half-a-dozen references, one in my own hometown whom I met for coffee. After speak to Ali by email and phone and then meeting his reference in person, I felt quite comfortable booking him for our trip. He helped me plan our itinerary and booked hotels for us. Our itinerary was: Marrakesh - Ouarzazate - Tinghir - Merzouga - Midelt - Fez - Rabat - Casablanca.Ali picked us up from the airport with his driver Youssef and a 4x4 Toyota Land Cruiser. He stayed with us the whole time as we sped across southern Morocco, stopping in tiny Berber villages along the way. He also arranged a 2-day camel trek into the desert, along with sandboarding - one of the most amazing experiences we have ever had.Ali speaks Berber, Classical Arabic, Moroccan Arabic, French, English and Spanish, and has a degree in Linguistics from the University of Meknes. He was a knowledgeable, friendly and very competent guide.We became good friends with both Ali and Youssef. If we ever took a local guide in one of the big cities (local guides are required by law in each city), Ali personally introduced us to him in advance. Youssef himself owns the Toyota and always made sure it was clean, functioning and safely guarded.Ali even arranged a cell phone for us, and texted us while we were with local guides to make sure everything was OK.Due to Ali's knowledge and hard work, we felt like guests in Morocco, not tourists. He introduced us to numerous locals in a way that you are never able to in groups. We had tea with a Berber woman who lives in a cave and has 11 children. As Ali put it, She has very little money but a very big heart.This trip really put into perspective the diversity of life in our world, and we returned to Morocco amazed in every way; by the rich culture, geography, language, cuisine, and hospitality. We could never have had such an amazing experience had we not had the good fortune of finding Ali Oussou."

We had Ali and Yusuf as our guide and driver, respectively, on our trip to Morocco.They were always courteous, professional, knowledgable, helpful, patient, and friendly. They were fun to chat with, always telling stories, and jokes and background information about various places.They also knew when to give us our own quiet time or alone time, which was great. They put together a customized itinerary for us for eight days, which includes some big cities (Fez, Marrakesh, Casablanca), smaller cities (Ouarzazate, etc.), the desert, and the Atlas mountains.One highlight was a visit with a local cave-dwelling family they know, where we got to hang out and see how they live.Fantastic guidance, great people, reasonable rates, will gladly use again."

Our group are not the sort of people who would generally choose to go on a guided tour of a country and have found our way around countries by ourselves previously. We hummed and harred about whether to go with a guide. My wife convinced us to go with Ali and Yousif as her mother had travelled with them before and had raved about it.We did not regret the decision at all.We would have missed so much if we had not travelled with Ali. His knowledge of the local areas was amazing and we went off the beaten path to see things that we would have drifted past if we had travelled solo.Some of the hotels were a bit of an adventure and they certainly added to the experience. The vehicle was comfortable and we stopped to take in the scenery and meet the locals, cats and camels along the way.Ali proved to be quite the entertainer and gave us a display of his drumming at a restaurant we stopped at along the way. The proprietors all seemed to know and like Ali and Yousif and were always happy to see him and share some jokes with him. We would not have been so well received if we had not been with them I'm sure. Our tour was the middle section of a two week holiday and was easily the highlight of the fortnight. We started in Marakech and were dropped off in Essaouira.It surprised us that Ali received messages and calls from previous travellers on our trip, but since leaving Morocco we have kept in touch and are promising ourselves that we will return and catch up with the eternally youthful Ali in person.If you can't decide whether to travel with Camel Safaries, stop thinking about it and just do it. The only reservations you should have fpr one of these tours should be in the charismatic hotels along the way."

            "review": "A big \"Shukran\". We just got back from a 13 days/ 12 nights trip in Morocco - all arranged through Camel Safaries. Ali Oussou was our guide and he surpassed his job. Months before the trip, we corresponded via emails and Ali was always prompt with his replies. I had a thousand questions and Ali was never short of answers. He picked us up from the airport and travelled with us throughout. What I liked about him the most was his positive attitude - anything you ask, he'd say \"It's possible\" - and he'd make it possible also. When my husband fell sick because of the heat in Merzouga, he arranged to keep the room for one whole day without any extra charge, so that my husband could sleep in through the day. The Riads we stayed in were breathtaking, the car that travelled with us was top notch, the places we visited were magical. We are absolute foodies and Ali made sure we ate at the local places and the Tagines and Tanginas we've had there were far more delicious than the ones at renowned but touristic restaurants.Ali is polite, friendly, enthusiastic, honest, flexible and it's very apparent that he takes pride in showing off his country to foreigners. Our driver was Hamid and he is such a sweet guy - a bit shy, but extremely funny. We are usually independent travellers, but decided to go through a pre-arranged tour of Morocco because of shortage of time and the distance we had to travel and I don't regret that I did it. The car was at our disposal and the distances, though very long sometimes, with enough stops in between, through breath taking landscapes, was worth it. I shopped around quite a bit before booking the tour through Camel Safaries and the reviews that I got on TripAdvisor and other travel forums about Camel Safaries was bang on and it was relatively cheaper too, than some of the quotes I got from other recommended guides and travel companies.I would absolutely recommend Ali and Camel Safaries to anyone planning a trip to Morocco. Thanks Ali. You made it a very memorable holiday."

Although I traveled by myself, I was accompanied by a guide and a driver. The duration of my trip fell on the period of Ramadan this year and my driver and my guide traveling with me under scorching sun for hours without water and food. However, they never complained and in fact, they were usually the one who tried to keep me awake by talking to me(I usually was tired out from the heat) and telling me stories of Morocco. They definitely show me the famous hospitality of Moroccans as they invited me to break the fast with them most nights and they became like my family members by the end of the trip. In the span of 2 weeks, I got to see Morocco's diverse landscapes, beautiful architecture, amazing artwork and mostly, the hospitality and warmth of Moroccans. People were so wonderful and were not hesitating to open up their doors and their hearts to me. When I left, I was being told that I have 2 new families in Morocco now and I will always be welcomed back. It was definitely an amazing trip and a great eye-opener, I will never forget about it and look forward to my future visit. Thank to Camel Safaries and a great thanks to Mohammed, Hamid, Brian and Ali for their wonderful work. You truly represent the essence of Morocco."

At all times we felt completely safe with our driver even though we travelled many windy narrow scenic roads and tracks.We thoroughly enjoyed the busy medinas of Fez, Meknes and of course Marrakesh (the night scene is something we will never forget). Also enjoyed greatly the picturesque, small hilltop village of Chefchaouen (don\u2019t miss it) and the seaside Essouria (great for relaxation) and mountain stay in the Atlas mountains. Also don\u2019t miss the ruins of Volubulis and these stunning mosaics. All this was in great contrast to the wonderfully scenic mountainous gorges and our unique desert camel experience.  All in all wonderful variety in our 2 weeks was experienced. As others have said our expectations were well and truly met and we have no hesitation in giving Ali and his company the highest recommendation."

            "review": "Morocco at it's best. In January I went on a 2 week holiday in Morocco with my partner, part of which included a 3-day tour with Camel Safaries. The tour we arranged involved departing from Marrakech and going through the High Atlas mountains, stopping by many sights in south-eastern Morocco, the first night in Dades Gorge and day 2 camping out in the desert in a berber tent, and the last day driving through the Middle Atlas mountains onto F\u00e9s. This was by far the best part of my holiday, especially the night in the desert.Ali really took care of us and did all he could to give us the best tour he could give. You could really see this was something he loved to do. Despite the long distance from Marrakech to the desert and then to F\u00e9s, we stopped to see so many things that it didn't feel like a long car ride. Ali talked the whole way tirelessly explaining every little detail, I felt bad at times when I would nod off because he was making so much of an effort and I really appreciated it as opposed to someone just driving you. The things we saw were amazing too. The snow covered High Atlas and Middle Atlas mountains, monkeys in the cedar forest, several Casbahs (the best being A\u00eft Benhaddou) and Oases, and some impressive valleys like Todra Gorge. We couldn't have seen these places in the amount of time on our own, nor would we have dared driving through those scary roads at the High Atlas mountains. When we got to the desert, I couldn't believe my eyes. It looked like a painting! I took a bottle full of sand from the Sahara as a souvenir just to show friends how red the sand is. The night out was also quite amazing. Despite the cold weather I got a rug out next to the fire and lay down with 2 thick blankets on top of me and just stared at the stars for ages. Its just amazing how lit up the sky is when there are no lights. The tents themselves are very traditional except for the beds inside, but i appreciated this since i already lay on the sand next to fire and couldn't imagine doing that for the night. If anyone is ever considering a trip to Morocco don't just hang out in the big cities like Marrakesh or F\u00e9s, make the effort to see the desert it really is worth it! Weeks before this trip when I was in Thailand for xmas, I remember talking to some norwegian tourists in my hotel who told me how unremarkable their desert tour was and how uncomfortable the camel ride was but I have to say the camel ride did not feel uncomfortable at all. It was very well cushioned and I was on such a high during the 2 hr camel ride that by the time it ended i was like .. oh are we there already??6 months on I still remember Morocco and how great it was there. Thanks Ali for an unforgettable 3 days."

We returned recently from 10 day tour covering the northern part of Morocco (Asilah [coast], Chefchaouen, Fes, Meknes, Volubilis) and mid-region areas Marrakech, Essaouira (coast), and Imlil. Consistency is the key\u2026.once again, Camel Safaries, exceeded our expectations. Our guide was just as detailed oriented, knowledgeable, and professional as our other tours. The vehicle was clearly well maintained and we felt at ease and safe with the driver especially on those winding roads! Camel Safaries employs experienced, local individuals that speak English very well and truly are passionate about their country and their jobs. Each was very personable which was so appreciated as we do enjoy conversations learning about the culture and intricacies of local life. It\u2019s amazing how many lovely areas there are in Morocco. Asilah was suggested through our research on travel sites like TripAdvisor and we were very pleased as it was much less touristy than expected. Essaouira was a lovely coastal town but a touristy. I highly recommend the \u201cfish stalls\u201d. A market of fresh fish, you choose and purchase, and next door is prepared to your liking in an outdoor restaurant area. Chefchaouen, a beautiful hillside village, located in the Rif mountains\u2026artistic blue-washed homes and wonderful place to wander. Fes was definitely a much larger city than Marrakech. We preferred Marrakech. The square of djemaa el Fna is always entertaining and of course, brushing-up on negotiating skills with time to shop amongst the various souks is a great experience and fun!"

We had a few cities and sites in our mind and hence, we sent our requests for private customised tour via email to different companies. Tenere Tours responded in a matter of minutes, with the full itinerary with other must-go sites that we have missed. The most importantly, they offered a great price! Rachid was very helpful and quick in answering questions. With his help, our application for Morocco Visa went well. We arrived at Marrakech Airport on the same day but different time (5 in the morning and 1 in the evening), yet Rachid and Ali went twice to pick us all up to our riad and helped us in settling down. With a skillful driver (Ali) and a hospitable tour guide (Rachid), we travelled in a really comfortable way on a mini van through Marrakesh, Essaouira, Ouarzazate, Merzouga, Arfoud, Fes and others. They would tell us stories and histories about the cities, stopping at different spots for nice panoramic views and photo-taking session, and sometimes throwing us with jokes. The whole journey was full of laughter and we got close really quickly. Something worth mentioning was that, they would celebrate the Islamic festival (Eid Al-Adha) on 12th of September, 2016, and because of this, we had the chance to explore a few authentic local markets that were really busy with people trying to get ready for their big festival, buying and selling goats, sheeps and other spices. The stop at the market on our way from Marrakech to Essaouira was quite random, but in my opinion was the best part of the trip!! Buzzing through the crowd, observing the locals' way of living, their culture, religion, food... EVERYTHING! That was AMAZING!!Throughout the journey, I was amazed by the various landscapes in Morocco. Dry land with cactus; ground with troves of marine fossils; mountains of different colour (red, brown or black); Sahara deserts with shrubs; national park with trees just like those in tropical country (My hometown: Malaysia!). Moroccan cuisine such as tagine, couscous, zaalouk, b'stilla, all tasted amazing! They are not spicy and hence, no worries. Their mint tea was refreshing and I think I am addicted to it (they called it Moroccan whiskey with zero alcohol, LOL!!) Rachid recommended us to local restaurants with tasty food at a reasonable price. He even helped us to bargain as we do have language barrier with the locals. The accommodation arranged by Rachid was brilliant. The staffs at the hotels and haimas were all helpful and warming, greeting us with smiles and always welcome us with their mint tea. Breakfasts were included and the hotels are all at the right spots, allowing us to walk around and explore the town by ourselves. The night in sahara was lively with their traditional musics, songs and board game. Rachid was a really responsible tour guide. When one of my friends fell sick in Sahara desert (probably due to motion sickness after riding the camel, or maybe because of the heat), he rushed to us, took good care of my friend, and stayed all night with us. His sincerity in making friends and his generosity show us the best side and also the beauty of Morocco. Once again, thanks a lot for the trip of a lifetime!!!!! We highly recommend this company to anyone.  Tips: - Travel in a larger group comes a better price. - Ask for permission if you would like to take photos of their stalls, or else you might end up being scolded."

Hassan replied to our email in a matter of minutes and he helped organize the tour and later, when we arrived late to Marrakech due to a delay in the airport, his brother Rashid picked us up and personally took us to our beautiful Riad. Despite it being very late in the evening, Rashid sat down with us, and while sharing tea, got to know us and reviewed what we wanted to do over the course of the 9 days- very professional and courteous. He introduced us to our driver Ali, who was responsible for taking us to our sites throughout the country. Ali was super friendly, knowledgeable, generous and most importantly accommodating. My wife and I weren't interested in waking up too early in the morning, so Ali would come and pick us up at 9:30/10:00. When we had to be at the port of Tangier early in the AM, Ali was ready at 4:30AM. We went during Ramadan, and despite not eating/drinking anything for the entire day, Ali was always cheerful, helpful, knowledgeable and engaging. We got to learn so much more about the culture, history and traditions just by being with him for the entire tour. In addition, we met professional and certified tour guides in each major city (Marrakesh, Fez, even the dessert), who taught us a great deal and even bargained for us! Our two nights in the desert were unforgettable. We rode camels, drove over the duns, visited Berber and Bedouin families, enjoyed traditional Berber music under the desert ski and enjoyed incredible service. While on the road, we crossed paths with Rashid and a tourist from Chile. Rashid stop his car, came and greeted us and even the tourist got out of the car to say hello. He was as excited as we were about the beauty of Morocco and the superb service Tenere Tours was providing for him.Rashid's professionalism and hospitality combined with Ali's good nature made our 9 day trip to Morocco an unbelievable and unforgettable experience.

It was like we were traveling with a friend, which made the experience all the more fun and comfortable the entire time. Not to mention, Hassan is well versed in several languages, which makes him that much more approachable and capable of connecting with people from around the world. I think its not only impressive, but a huge asset for travelers who come from different places around the world. All in all, Tenere Tours, especially Hassan as our guide, made our Morocco adventure outstanding and my favorite travel experience yet.

We were 3 adults, and as we had a driver & a guide the 3 of us had to share the back seat, this is something to consider depending on who is traveling. We travel during the month of Ramadan. 2 advantages: first, you get to see in deep how they live this month and the importance of the religion in their culture; also, I understand is a less \"touristy' time, so there is less congestion. The only downfall is that most of the good restaurants in the big cities are not open for lunch, and at night if you are an early bird (like we are), you have to wait after 8 pm to get served in many places. The only thing that I would do different, is maybe go a little more upscale in the hotels. In general they are decent and clean, good service and food, but having been there, I now think with a little more money is worth the upgrade. If you travel during the summer sunblock, sunglasses and a good hat is a must! We reached temperatures over 45 Celsius in the desert. Overall we had a great experience, and left Morocco feeling is a Country rich in culture and history, with very kind people that understand the important role that tourism plays in their economy. Both Rashid and Hassan were very attentive, punctual, organized. Always making sure we were having a great time! They are fun to travel with and very knowledgeable of their culture and Country."

Luckly, weeks before, 3 of my friends and i found a chance to visit Morocco in our final year summer vacation and we had planned to visit this mysterious country for so long and fortunately we found Tenere Local Tours as our priority. The tour took us for 6 days, we acrossed and visited the places from Marrakech to Sahara Desert and then to Fes. Although the date of the trip was not quite enough as we have other schedule to go after 29/5, Rachid Ait Khouya (The local tour guy from Tenere Tours) compressed the trip with keeping the most important attractiones for us. Also, he brought us to visit the local market that 4 of us were only Asian in there which was quite weired lol. Overall, high recommend for Tenere Tour if any of you visit Morcocco as the price and the quality of the service are so cheap and professional. Lastly,Thank you again Rachid Ait Khouya for treating us as your family members and thank you for all the memories in the trip. Hoping that we can meet you soon in the future, my friend. Leo"

One difference is Tenere is a lot cheaper and I was worried there was something awry. Lucky we took the punt, we had an awesome time! Rachid was our host of a group of 11 guys and gals in their late 20s-late 30s (mostly Aussies) and we loved it. We started in Marrakech and made our way to the Sahara and back seeing the Atlas Mountains and a number of unesco sites on the way. My only criticism is that there is a fair amount of time on the road but that's no fault of the Tenere, it's just the way of the land. I am also unsure how different a 3 day vs 4 day (we did the 4 day) tour as we had mates do a 3 day and they did most of our highlights. Either way, the Sahara is phenomenal and not to be missed, definitely the highlight of Morocco. Rachid as a tour guide is hilarious too, couldnt ask for a better guide, definitely makes a difference."

It's truly unique, and the hospitality across the country is fantastic. Everyone was so nice!

Most of us are Bulgarians,but we have a Czech guy and a Swiss girl in the group as well. In this episode, we decide to go somewhere for New Year and spent a few days there. Fast forward a few episodes. We've had numerous arguments and debates about the dates, places, length of the trip and so on. We've settled for 3-5 days after the 3rd of January, and we're deciding mainly between Morocco and Russia. After final look at the offers we have, we choose Morocco. 8 of us are going, between the 3rd and the 7th. The agency-Tenere Tours Morocco. The guide-the main protagonist in the series-Rachid! And the second part of the TV season is like an ecranisation of \"One Thousand and One Nights\". Beautiful old cities and villages, busy markets, where you forge bargains with the merchants for their handcrafted treasures, places where movies like \"The Mummy\", \"Laurence of Arabia\", \"Gladiator\" and \"Babel\" were shot, \"Game of Thrones\" scenes as well, smiling and frienly people... At least two episodes have to be dedicated to the desert camp trip and the night spend there. Never have I seen so many stars n the sky, and the drum party organised by our hosts was mesmerising, pure magic! From the largest North African palm grove to the UNESCO cite of Ait Ben Haddou, from Marrakech to Sahara, this was a maginificent journey. And it wouldn't have been even close to this without Rachid and this agency. They knew all the best places, wanted us to see everything possible, while having fun at the same time. And we met iterally hundreds of people, who knew Rachid and greeted him warmly, made discounts for us and so on. The untainted luxury in the hotels and the desert camp was beyond our imagination, when we paid for the trip. We were often wondering how did we manage to get all of this so cheap. Grab warm clothes for the winter, and go for the adventure of your life! And we're already thinking about the second season of our much beloved \"Everybody Loves Rachid\" series! ^^"

Having had the opportunity to visit this beautiful country back in 2006, I didn't think the private group tour we had booked would show me anything I hadn't already experienced previously but I was proved wrong! From the start, our guide (Rachid) was extremely friendly, personable and always on hand to answer any queries we had. We were shown plenty of amazing sights and delights along the way, as well as spots off the beaten track that only a local would know. He made me see these places in a whole new light and reinvigorate my interest in destinations that I had visited already.One of the highlights for me was the trek into the Sahara desert on the camels and spending a night in a nomadic Berber camp watching the sunset and moon rising as well as singing and dancing around the camp fire well into the night! Rachid's jovial nature added a light-hearted mood to our tour experience which suited our group very well - he was so easy to get along with and was always there if we needed any assistance. He is multi-lingual and was happy to even let me practise my limited Spanish on him throughout the tour! :)Highly recommend Rachid and Tenere Tour Morocco to anyone wanting to gain a wonderful insight into an amazing country and its people, culture, food and lifestyle.

We met Ali from Tenere Tours in Marrakech and drove down to Ait Ben Haddou to meet up with Rachid in a private car. Rachid and Ali were not only excellent tour guides who were very knowledgeable about all aspects of Moroccan culture and destinations but they were also extremely easy and pleasant to be around. We instantly liked them both and felt like we could trust them. We wanted to get out of the cities and touristy areas and that is what we did! Rachid took us to his small Berber village in the middle of the desert and into other local market places and villages that really gave us a taste of real Moroccan life. After our tour was scheduled to end we asked Rachid if he could take us on for another 5 days as we really appreciated his knowledge of the country and trusted his taste. We highly recommend Rachid at Tenere Tours and really think he is the best guy for the job!"

Mainly because Morocco and the Sahara were truly amazing experiences but it was also due to the tender love and care given by Tenere Tours. Usually, I'm not one for tours. I prefer to just go and explore on my own. I went ahead and booked the tour anyway, another decision well made. The tour guides picked up my group directly from the gate at the airport and off we went. Our primary tour guide, Rashid, was the best. A local of the entire region, he was able to point out and recommend the best places for everything, including points of interest, photo opportunities, and fabulous food. The guides were a blast, keeping the trip fun and exciting. They remained flexible by letting us stop anywhere we asked.In conclusion, Morocco is a wonderful place. Everywhere the tour took us to was great and a lot of fun. The hotels where awesome, the towns and markets are a portal to another world, and the mighty Sahara itself was grand. Tenere Tours, thank you for the wonderful memories, I can't wait to go back."

Look no further than the crew at Tenere Tours Morocco for proof! Our amazing guide, Rachid, took us from Marrakech to the Sahara and back, not only stopping at all of our predetermined sites, but taking the time to share the hidden wonders as well. From ancient Casbahs and traditional, African cultural centers to Beduin tribes and local markets, we experienced things you won't read about in any guidebook. Things that would only have been possible with the assistance of an experienced and knowledgeable guide. With Rachid no request was too great, and no question went unanswered. We traveled in comfort and safety, and with Rachid the time spent in transit was nearly as entertaining as the time spent exploring.You could certainly explore Morocco on your own, but why would you want to when you can arrange an infinitely customizable, efficient and affordable guide from Tenere Tours Morocco? I'll never visit Morocco without their assistance, and I can't recommend their service enough for inexperienced and experienced travelers alike."

This is the best way to travel! We had a comfortable 4x4 SUV, were able to stop when we wanted and Said is a great guide with lots of knowledge.

            "review": "Great Tour Arranged for Us - we highly recommend!. We sourced Soul Adventure 4X4 Tours via Trip Advisor and decided this was the way to see Morocco \u2013 and we were not disappointed. From the start Said worked with us to develop an itinerary that suited us, with accommodation that met our requirements of a pool (it was going to be hot) and reasonable standard/cost. All our needs were met and the accommodation used was exactly what we had requested, usually being family run Riads offering very tidy and clean rooms with great hospitality. We loved each and every one and each one was just right for our family. Said also worked with us to ensure we either received a family room or 2 rooms close together, and being low season we could usually make the choice.The vehicle used was also perfect, and being a large Toyota Prado 4x4 we felt completely safe and ready to take on any roads. It allowed us to see some of the off-the-road parts of Morocco that other tours may miss. Plenty of room for bags and the family of 4 so we didn\u2019t need to use the roof-rack.We undertook a 12 day odyssey of Northern Morocco and probably covered a little too much ground, but we did see a lot this wonderful country has to offer. We travelled to Marrakesh, Essaouira, Taroudante, Quarzazate, Dades Gorge, Merzourga, Fez, Chefchaouen and Tangiers (only to depart) and there were some long days of driving in there. But also many highlights and great experiences so hard to decide what we may have amended. Definitely the night in the Berber camp at Merzourga was a highlight, amidst the spectacular red dunes of the Sahara, stunning clear sky and lots of fun for the kids. But the other places each had something to offer the tourist. My most nervous part of booking the tour was sending the deposit! Always a bit worrying sending money to an organization you don\u2019t know, and we elected to use a bank transfer over Western Union (the latter which is easier for Soul Adventure I think). We paid a 10% deposit and the balance on arrival, and I am pleased to report my caution was not required as everyone and everything was as arranged prior. I can also report Said is also utterly and completely honest \u2013 twice we amended or changed hotel arrangements and twice he ensured we received the refund of any difference quickly (aside from loaning me cash when we ran out of ATMs one day!).So I would completely recommend Soul Adventures for your Morocco Tour and would happily respond to any queries or questions. The tour was easily arranged, priced very competitively and performed professionally throughout. As a family we loved it and had a wonderful trip with Said.Finally \u2013 we travelled completely during Ramadan which did have some impact but much smaller than we had expected. No trouble eating food and drinking in public at all, and most restaurants are open for tourists. We had one day in a more remote village where one place was closed, but Said found a second restaurant which was able to serve lunch. That was the only time over 2 weeks. Of course we also had to be a little flexible with Said, given he was fasting all day, allowing a later start time and a rest during the heat of the day. But there are far less tourists than usual and most Riads were not busy at all (choice of rooms). So overall there are no issues travelling during this time if you have to (for us it was dictated by school break).Go ahead and book with faith in these guys!"

He took care of all the details for us according to our travel preferences, including arranging a trek in the Dades gorge with an overnight in a nomad cave (the highlight of our trip!). Said was always checking in to make sure we were enjoying ourselves, and we felt that he truly cared and wanted to show us the best of Morocco. He is very trustworthy, and we felt safe throughout the trip. Soul Adventure 4x4 came highly recommended to us by friends, and we have recommended them to many of our friends since our return."

When my friends and I traveled to Morocco and went on the Soul Adventures 4x4 tour with Said as our guide, who later became like a brother to us, I knew this was the best portion of our trip. The experience that Said so confidently led us through was one I'll never forget for the rest of my life. From being humbled by the immensity of the Atlas Mountain range, to sleeping under the stars of the Sahara desert, it was a magical experience to say the least. The food, the people, and of course, the knowledgable and charismatic Said to help us along the way. Thank you Soul Adventures Morocco!"

It was one of the best guided tours we've experienced. The highlights:- Said clearly cares about the comfort of his guests. He inspected the hotel rooms we stayed at before we entered and checked in with us frequently to ensure we were enjoying ourselves. Without us asking, he even requested a private Berber tent camp and small toilet for us for the one night we spent in the desert. The camp can sleep up to 40 or 50, so to have it all to ourselves was a huge luxury.- Said never rushed us or appeared bored. He seemed content to wait for us and work on a flexible schedule.- Excellent selection of activities and views. Our favorites were the ksar of Ait Ben Haddou, desert camping, and eating traditional tagine at his family's home. Other cool activities were searching for wild Barbary apes in the cedar forests of Azrou, having mint tea in the tent of a Berber nomad, and taking in all the amazing gorge views.- Excellent hotel and restaurant suggestions. We were very happy with Chez Pierre and Riad Madu (see my reviews) and every meal we ate.We have hired several tour guides in different countries and this is by far one of the best and most comprehensive. I would highly recommend Said and Soul Adventure 4x4!"

It was my wife & I on our honeymoon, we went to Spain then by ship to Morocco, the driver picked us up on time from the port, drove us to all the places we asked him for, we even needed to try things outside of our agreed upon trip (a Moroccan bath which I recommend anyone to ask for that in their trip) and he spent the extra time & effort to find us one of the quality hammams (tourists baths as they call them), we were even a bit picky on the food, and the driver accommodated all of our requests and took us to the right places (restaurants) to try the types of food we were craving. The hotels were so unique and awesome. He even helped us with bargaining with the locals at the market for the shopping we did. The other tour guides (because in the old parts of the cities we visited (Fes & Meknes), the company hired a dedicated tour guide and they were very friendly and knowledgable. Also the driver has the advantage of speaking the 2 main languages spoken in Morocco which is Arabic & Amazighi and his English was really good. I highly recommend this Soul Adventures and their private tours. And just to be fair the owner/manager of the company used to call the driver a few times a day to follow up on us and spoke with me a couple of times to check on us and make sure everything is ok and all is according to the plan.Now as for Morocco, it is a beautiful country, we only had 5 days to spend in Morocco but I wish we had more time to see more, the hotels we stayed at the majority of times were called (Riyad) and the manegers/owners of these Riyads were very friendly people, I remember there was a wedding in Meknes after midnight and I really wanted to see it, so the owner of that Riyad opened the door for me and let me record the wedding and watch the locals dancing in colourful clothing, was beautiful. I even wanted to try McDonald's while we were there and they sent their driver to get us a meal (we paid extra obviously but they were very accommodating).Just a general tip if you are going to Morocco:1. If you agree on paying by euros, make sure you bring euros with you. Same if you agree on US dollars then bring US dollars with you. I am from Canada and I did not bring Euros with me (which was a mistake) because the local exchange rates are different from the international rates. And on that note, Morocco is a very safe country, the people are not wealthy yet very friendly. And the driver is super trustworthy, he helped me many times in finding local currency exchanges to pay for things, I even made a mistake and paid him extra one time, and he corrected me and paid me back and that was very honest and kind of you, he really deserved every euro of tip I gave him.2. Cellular internet is not the best in Morocco (I mean the data on mobile phones) but at all the hotels they was wifi connections and it worked so that was good.That's it really, again, thank you Said from Soul Adventures and I look forward to coming to Morocco again for another trip (hopefully soon)."

He took us to a nomad tent on the edge of the desert, and we had a glimpse of the hard life this nomadic family was living.

Said and Mohammed are the best guides we could have asked for - friendly, unbelievably helpful and sweet, full of life and information about Morocco. We got a great feel of the place. The most important thing is that this tour is not very expensive and is well worth every penny you pay. The fact that we missed Said and Mohammed after our trip is enough to say how amazing our time with Soul Adventure was.

With two 4x4's we went from Marrakesh - Skoura - Tinjdad - Merzouga - Ouzina - Agdz and Marrakesh again. Our guides (both called Mohamed) were very enthusiastic, full of humor, friendly and thoughtful. We've seen and learned a lot about Morocco in only a week! The scenery changed constantly (from the high Atlas mountains to the various sights of the desert). Especially the gold / orange sand dunes were exceptional.These guys knew so many people along the road and brought us to places we would have never seen otherwise. The Moroccan people were very friendly and the food is just delicious! Enough reasons to pay a visit, especially with Soul Adventure 4x4, they're worth it!"

You can cutomize the tour if you have strong preferences, though found the itinerary they chose to want for nothing. This is a smallish outfit, run by 3 brothers, so you get personal treatment. This is really an excellent way to get from Fes to Marrakech (or the reverse) and take in the mountains and desert if you don't want to go back to Casablanca: it was a far better use of time for us. Accomodation they arranged and food along they way were great. The night at the Bedouin camp in the desert was a high point. The ride (a Toyota Landcruiser) couldn'y have been more comfortable. Our guide Said was very knowledgeable. All in all great."

From the beginning they were extremely responsive and helpful, starting with the planning of the trip and continuing all the way to the end. With e-mails flying back and forth, Said took our rather vague preferences (we want to stay in riads and auberges and do a lot of walking\u2026 Oh, and also, not too many day in cities\u2026and we are interested in local food) and constructed a wonderful personalized 10 day tour of (mostly) Berber Morocco that was perfect for us. Their choices of \"riads and auberges\" for us to stay in were outstanding, truly Moroccan places of various kinds that pleased us immensely. Many were so out-of-the-way that we would never have found them on our own. They ranged from rather simple kasbahs to former palaces (one was even in a beautiful building parts of which dated to 1378!) but all were very clean and comfortable and every single one had friendly and welcoming management. Most were locally owned and operated, which I appreciate, both because I like to meet local people and because I prefer to spend my tourist dollars where they will benefit the local economy. Mohamed was a truly excellent driver--the best I've had in this kind of tour. I always felt completely safe whether we were moving at high speed on the highway, threading our way through chaotic city streets, or bumping down a rocky 4-wheel drive track leading to a nomad family camp. Said was with us too, and together the two of them took perfect care of us. They were friendly and good company, and showed us many facets of Morocco we would not have found on our own. They arranged local food (wonderful) for us and sought out local markets to show us. I was especially grateful for Said's help with bargaining; I always felt he was on our side in all transactions. Finally, the local guides they found and recommended for the cities and historical sites were always excellent. Overall, I can't think of a thing I would complain about.  I highly recommend SoulAdventure4x4 for your trip to Morocco -- Their prices were far lower than comparable tours arranged by USA or European travel companies and you will get a much better, more personalized experience."

He speaks more languages than I can count and knows everything there is about Morocco. The tour, while a little more expensive than I had initially planned, was well worth the money as I always felt absolutely secure both with Lahcen as an individual, and in the car (which was comfortable and rugged).Just as a small example of the kind of care Lahcen takes with his tourists, he brought us to his home and introduced us to his brother and children. It was such a warm gesture and it speaks to the kind of people they are.As far as tours are concerned, this was excellent. We went everywhere we wanted and stayed only as long as we wanted. It was highly individualized and we were always well fed (even though, again, it was during Ramadan). Lahcen and Said come from a berber family so they know the land better than anyone else, and it showed at all times.I would strongly recommend this tour to anyone considering a trip to Morocco!"

I have just travelled yet again with six friends (f) in two 4 x 4 in Morocco, yet again with Mohamed and Brahim as our guides/chauffeurs. Another exceptional journey thanks to their knowledge of the region, their easy contact with all the locals (Berbers like themselves), their constant good humour \u2013 and sense of humour \u2013 and superb organisation. It was life made easy without ever losing the feeling of adventure. However, of course they can\u2019t do the impossible and it was on occasion very cold in the little local auberges (whch one would never find on one\u2019s own) and on occasion there was no hot water .... but if you choose to travel into the interior, on little routes not even marked on the map, to areas of extraordinary beauty which the majority of travellers will never see, you accept in advance that there will be moments of questionable comfort. If you don\u2019t have a spirit of adventure and a very open mind you will not have embarked on this sort of journey. The scenery is breathtaking, ever-changing, fabulous .... I run out of adjectives! We each took over 500 photos. Mohamed speaks excellent Spanish and his English gets ever better, especially after being with us for ten days! They both know some words of Dutch and German as well as Swedish now. Brahim speaks very good French, and of course both speak Arabic and Berber.I find them both very attentive and caring, whether you are the youngest in the group (-40) or the oldest (myself \u2013 80). I cannot recommend them highly enough, and by writing this for Trip Advisor I want yet agaIn to say MANY MANY THANKS AND INSHALLAH SEE YOU NEXT YEAR."

We were travelling with our two children aged six and eight and our guide Said could not have been more hospitable and accommodating. Most importantly from our perspective was how safe we felt. Our driver was extremely skilled, which matters a lot when driving through the hairpin turns of the High Atlas, and we always felt like Said was looking out for our best interests. Perhaps the best illustration of this was after we had eaten an overpriced lunch at a restaurant that did not deliver what it had promised, Said went in and negotiated a refund on our behalf. We didnt ask him to do this, but he noticed my husband's annoyance with the restaurant and just quietly solved the problem for us. This is just one example of the very high level of customer service we continually received. The hotels, restaurants and camel trek that Soul Adventures arranged for us were great, and we really felt like we got great value for our money with this trip. We highly recommend Soul Adventures."

We started in Fes and ended in Marrakesh, through Merzouga and the Gorges. Soul Adventuress 4x4 filled the itinerary with many delightful and unexpected authentic experiences along the way that there is no way we would have done with a group tour or if we were traveling on our own. Our guide (Mohammed) took us deep into the remote villages and valleys in the heart of Morrocco, shared with us his passion and knowledge of the people and their traditions. Because of his extremely personable personality, we were able to see first-hand how many of the nomads and other native Moroccans live. Where other guides and their clients would just walk or drive by a nomad camp, Mohammed would manage to get us invited in for tea. He was great with the kids and quickly felt like part of the family. He was very attentive to ensuring we were satisfied with the hotels and restaurants and went above and beyond in providing us a relaxing and adventure-filled vacation. Whenever the drive got a little long, Mohammed would pull over, crank up the tunes and get us all dancing and laughing. The planning process was simple and very prompt and Soul Adventures 4x4 delivered far more than they promised and at great value. I recommend Soul Adventures 4x4 without hesitation to anyone looking for to really experience Morocco-I just wish that everyone we know could enjoy this same experience."

We had a camel trek through the desert which was absolutely amazing. It was so nice to be away from the stresses of modern-day life and take in the tranquility and slow-paced Berber life. I learned so much about Moroccan culture through this trip. I\u2019ve been to Morocco before but having a personal guide makes the experience more personable and we felt like a tight-knit family.

My boyfriend and I just got back from a week in Morocco, and just to hit the punchline up front - we could not possibly imagine having enjoyed our trip without Lahcen, Said, and Mohammed, who together run Soul Adventure 4x4. Look no further for a guide \u2013 it\u2019s easy to be skeptical of these Tripadvisor posts but trust us when we say that these guys made our trip; they were easy to communicate with in advance, planned a fantastic trip, but most of all, were incredibly genuine, good people, and we left feeling as if we\u2019d made good friends in Morocco.We\u2019d done an exhaustive amount of research before leaving New York for our trip, both on TripAdvisor and elsewhere, for the right guide, since we had a pretty specific idea of what we were looking for. We had three days during which we wanted to start in Fez, drive all the way out to Merzouga and spend a night in the desert in the Erg Chebbi dunes, and then make our way back to Marrakech. Said was impressively responsive on email, and understood our needs and was accommodating in arranging the trip, and also made very helpful suggestions. Lahcen (who speaks five languages, including perfect English and French, among other things) was there waiting for us in Fez to start our trip, exactly as we had arranged, and ended up being a fantastic guide. They even welcomed us into their home on the drive out into the desert, where we had tea with their family, getting a true genuine experience.They arranged for a great night out in the desert (was just the two of us and our guide) and then we had a very easy drive back, spending the night in Ouarzazate, and then ending in Marrakech. To top it all off, Lahcen, who also happened to still be in Marrakech, even insisted on meeting us a day after our tour had ended to drive us to the airport from our riad in Marrakech.All in all, we can\u2019t speak highly enough of the team \u2013 we highly recommend Soul Adventure 4x4!"

My husband and I recently visited Morocco and experienced the best vacation ever! i want to share my favorite part of our trip with anyone who is looking forward at visiting Morocco. my favorite destination was the desert of Merzouga, so here is what we experienced :After a peaceful night of sleep we departed with Said in his 4x4 to visit the local villages. In the village of Khamlia we watched the traditional dances and music of Gnawa. We visited bazaars and bought ourselves turbans to prepare for our afternoon camel trek into the dunes. For lunch Said took us to his family\u2019s home where we enjoyed a delicious homemade traditional dish of Kalia and tea made by his grandmother. After two hours of camel trekking into the highest dunes in the world we arrived at the oasis which is located bellow one of the highest dunes of the desert. We enjoyed a cup of tea while meeting other tourists from around the world. Dinner is prepared by the camel men that led us to the oasis. After dinner we enjoyed the dances and the music of the drums played the same men who cooked our meal. These camel men are truly amazing, they speak many languages, trek us through the dunes, cook our meals, entertain us with dancing and music, tell jokes and fix your turban! Very hospitable. Before we retired in our Berber tent for the evening we walked through dunes, enjoyed the stars and listened to the camels chewing. We awoke early the next morning to enjoy the sunrise over the dunes. It is amazing how the sand dunes changes color from beige to a yellow orange color during this time. After this we camel trekked back to the Kasbah for showers and breakfast. It was now time to say goodbye to Merzouga. If you ever plan on visiting Morocco, Merzouga is a must see. Our tour guide, Said, was one of the best guides I have ever had the privilege of dealing with, he was knowledgeable about all the destinations we visited, humorous and very gracious. Soul Adventure 4x4 made this trip absolutely enjoyable by making it completely carefree. My husband and I will definitely return to this beautiful country to experience more of what it has to offer and we will definitely use the same excursion company."

When we arrived we were greeted by Samir , who helped us with luggage. On the way to the hotel he was very friendly and telling us about various sites to visit around marocco . I have been to marakech 3 times so we talked a lot about that. There were 4 of us traveling and he turned up with a very spacious 7 seater. Also worth a mention that you can pay in drams, euros or sterling. A few days later we had problems and had to change hotels, I phoned jamal and he sent a driver straight away to help us all move and ferry us backwards and forwards. After that we used easy take several times to go on days trips, we went on a trip to ouzard valley waterfalls and then to beach resort essaouira , both were great value for money. With English speaking drivers, Samir was especially great telling us loads of info on the way. Finally hakim returned us to the airport . Great service for the whole 2 weeks. I will use again next time I go."

Jamal the owner was very helpful with advice and organising my excursions. Sameer the driver was extremely helpful and punctual. He also offered advice and gave us lots of interesting information about the places we were visiting. We had three excursions with easy take transport Casablanca, Esouaria and Ozoud waterfalls and Sameer made sure that we were always comfortable. Jamal also organised our quad biking excursion as again I was being quoted extortionate prices by the Riad and other online companies, very reasonable prices and again they picked us up from the Riad and dropped us back. Jamal offered us free airport transfers for our return journey when our Riad quoted us 150 mdh. Overall I can't recommend these guys enough and would use them again without question. "

Contact is fast and in English via email. They make agreements based on the needs of the client. They are flexible when you changed travel plans. On all three trips they had plenty of time.Transport is offered in fairly new cars with plenty of space and air conditioning.The most important thing I found that the driving style of the driver is good and safe. The drivers abide by this company to the traffic rules . For traveling with kids this is very nice."

Jamal the manager has been one of the most friendliest, straight forward and honest person and is a treasure for the company.I booked through the website and received an email and a call within a minute of the booking. The company is multi lingual--Arabic, English and French (may have more). Their collection timing is on the spot and go beyond your expectation to ensure you have a great service.We booked a two way journey for a family of 8 to an aqua park. The journey was full of insight into Marrakesh and Morroca life and culture. A complimentary child seat was provided with very clean air conditioned transport. One point I have to make on my review is the poor review given to the company and having read it. I do not feel it is justifiable in any way but also it is important for readers to look at the overall reviews made.Wonderful in a sense"

Seen as this was our second trip to Marrakech, this time we opted for a rural holiday in a villa on the outskirts of Marrakech, as opposed to the city like last time. We therefore, needed a transfer from the airport to the villa, about 40 minutes away.We contacted several companies before and Easy Take was the cheapest and above all with excellent reviews here, so we booked. Jamal was excellent with any questions and info regarding an enfant car seat for our son, everything fine.Humza was waiting at the airport for us and helped escort us and our luggage to the car, nice, clean, air-conditioned. He spoke excellent English and French and was very kind and chatty. I have already recommended them to my aunt for her holiday In August (and again, after price comparisons, they also work out cheaper for day tours too, looks like we've found a gem ;-) ) and I will certainly contact them again in the future. Thank you Jamal and Humza for making our transfer go smoothly and your more than honest prices."

The driver, Hakim was waiting for me with a sign that was clearly visible. Taking the 2 1/2 hour drive was a way better move than sitting in the airport. The drive to Marrakech was wonderful as i got to see more of the country,  I used Easy Take Transport everyday of my trip. I had the most friendly and knowledgeable driver. His name was Samir and I highly recommend you request him. He was with me from 9am -2am. Always made sure I was taken care of everywhere we went. He knew all the great spots to see and the ones that were too touristy and not worth it. I never felt unsafe or concerned about anything while traveling with East Take. The owner emailed or called through out my trip to make sure i was ok and if I needed anything. They really know wheat they are doing and I wouldn't travel any other way in Morocco.  I look forward to returning and using the service again. Thank you Samir, Hakim and Jamal. You guys rock!!! Spencer"

That was quite an experience as the area was full of people, donkey carts and motorcycles. The man with the cart got us right to the door through the crowds, twists and turns safe and sound (tip him well). For our return to the airport, I emailed Easy Take the day before and made arrangements for an early morning pick up.

We used EasyTake for both airport transfers and a day trip to Essaouira .At the airport , a driver was waiting upon our arrival with an efficient transfer to our hotel.The service was so good that we later booked the transfer back and a full day with a driver to the Atlantic coast.On each occasion we had a email to confirm the arrangements including agreed prices.A special thanks must go to Hamza, who took us to the seaside.He was very professional asking when and where we wanted to stop for breaks,.but more importantly he really made our day with his friendly manner and local knowledge."

While in the plane I received confirmation from Jamal. By the time we landed in the airport of destination Jamal was waiting for us, his car clean and comfortable. He had already contacted our hotel and arranged for us to be picked up at particular place by somebody from hotel staff as the hotel was in pedestrian area. We immediately booked return transfer for our last day in Marrakesh and everything was just perfect that day also. Highly recommend. And thank you once again, Jamal! For your excellent service and your trust!"

We were in Marrakech for a few days and had no prior knowledge of Marrakech or Morocco, so upon recommendations we booked easy take to pick us up from the airport. Hamza was waiting for us and was timely, polite and friendly, we could not have asked for more and booked him for the return journey as well.2 days later we booked him for a car tour of the Atlas mountains, we had a fabulous day, the highlight of our holiday. Hamza was polite and timely, incredibly knowledgable about the area and culture, he spoke great English and had a lovely sense of humour. We saw the mountains, a medical herb place, had tea at a berbers house, stopped to explore some lovely potteries and art galleries.private walking tour with Ben for our first morning, so we could get a feel for the place. This was the perfect thing to do as Ben was polite, friendly and knowledgable and adapted the day to suits the needs of my mother. We had a wonderful day, full of interesting sights, sounds and smells and got an insight in to the culture and history of the area and would thoroughly recommend him :-)"

This is important to us as we prefer to travel with our plans open, rather than preparing a detailed itinerary in advance.Muhammad was out driver for each of the transfers. He was very pleasant, friendly and professional. The level of conversation was just right; he pointed out things of interest and answered all of our questions when we had them. Especially important was that Muhammad was on time and waiting for us as agreed on each of the 3 occasions. He greeted us with a sign at Casablanca airport and was waiting for us on each of the 2 following occasions; we didn't have to worry about anything. He was also happy to stop for us to get food, take comfort breaks or take photos.The vehicle appeared brand new, was spotless and very comfortable.Would highly recommend Easy Take for your transfers in the Marrakesh area."

Guide of Epic Zagora Ali showed us the real Marrakech explaining local traditions and showing us parts of Marrakech we would never have found on our own. We also went to the palace and souks as well as visiting a local baker that baked other people's dough. His English is excellent and he patiently explained everything and answered all our questions. Our trip to the Atlas Mountains was superb. Khalid arranged for a very comfortable 4x4 with a experienced driver enabling us to go off road. Ali pointed out places of interest on the way and the driver stopped in order for us to take photos of the locations and fantastic views. We had refreshments with a local Berber family who were most hospitable in showing us their home, plus stopping at other places on route to the Atlas Mountains Idir is an excellent guide who goes the extra mile. We were not rushed at any time enabling us to go at our own pace. When we come to Marrakech again we will have no hesitation in booking Idir for our tours."

I really don't know if they make us some special price (maybe off season?) but we traveled on our own van for same price other companies ask for 4 places in 16-passenger buses.

We researched things to do and see, and decided on a day trip. It was difficult to choose a tour company as so many reviews were excellent on trip adviser, but having contacted a few I was very pleased to receive an immediate reply from Easy Take Transport who offered a choice of day trips. Reading that a couple of the trips were quite a distance, over 3 hours driving in each direction we opted for a shorter visit to the Ourika Valley. Our driver/guide arrived at our hotel a little before the arranged time. The car was large, clean and comfortable and while our driver didn't speak brilliant english we enjoyed the challenge of using our little French and managed to communicate well. His enthusiasm and pride in his country of his country were infectious. Breakfast at a Berber house was the highlight of our holiday. Sharing freshly cooked bread with such wonderful, welcoming people was a joy.Our local guide, (Omar) up to the waterfall was knowledgeable about the area both historically and geographically. Clambering over the rocks up the mountain is not for the faint hearted but well worth the effort and Omar ensured our safety through out.Overall a brilliant day out. thank you to all"

Maybe we should have more prior research before taking the trip but the way it was billed was as though it's a tour guide/driver to the location.As a driver this trip was 100% but as a tour this was a poor choice of company.

Jamal picked us up at the ryad right in time with a comfortable car, then we went off to Zagora (desert) with several stops for interesting sites & views.It was never a problem for Jamal to make a stop for a drink or a toilet break.We arrived in Zagora in the evening, took the camel to go to our tents in the desert. It was a magical evening. The next day, Jamal picked us up again and dropped us next to our ryad in Marrakech. The last day of our trip, my friends and I spent the day at Rhoul Palace, which was quite far from our ryad so we had to take our luggage (three women, no further explanation needed). So Jamal suggested he would pick us up at the Palace and drop us at the airport. That was really helpful to avoid the stress to be at the airport in time etc. Since we were hungry, he stopped at a great pastry shop. At the airport, he helped us with our luggage and accompanied us to the check-in.Conclusion: we never felt unsafe, Jamal provided an excellent service (always in time) and could answer all our questions. Also strongly recommended for women travelling alone.Thanks Jamal for this great experience!"

Became quite concerned just before our trip in case Easytake weren't as good as reviewed but needn't have worried thank goodness!!Jamal or one of his team were always ready and waiting for us on the dot. The vehicles were comfortable and good looking and with air con, and looked as though they had just been cleaned inside and out. All of the drivers were friendly, welcoming and helpful.When taking us for our flight home, Jamal actually took us into the airport building itself and right up to our check in desk - so very kind Jamal - much appreciated - you will be fondly thought of every time we think of our lovely holiday in Marrakech"

Me and my girlfriend went to Marrakech last weekend, we had a wonderful stay at the Riad Jenai and we had the pleasure to meet Jamal Boukoune from Easy Take Transport, who came to pick us up at the airport when we arrived and took us back to the plane when we left. Impeccable service, great punctuality (especially at the departure, which was quite early in the morning), very comfortable car, and Jamal is very kind, helpful and tactful. We arranged the transfer service through the Riad Jenai, and of course we'll do the same next time."

All the booking arrangements went very smoothly and Jamal responded to e-mails promptly.The vehicle ( SUV) was spotless and comfortable and he drove very carefully through the city and through the countryside to Asni and then to Imlil. Jamal speaks good English and took an interesting route to Asni which meant that we saw more of the countryside than if he had gone directly.In Imlil a very nice young Berber guide showed us around and we had a good walk through the hills to a guesthouse where we had a good lunch of salad,bread,tagine and fruit. This was charged extra,but at 8 Euros per person was a reasonable cost in our view.Our return journey was also interesting an again Jamal looked after us well,stopping at a good caf\u00e9 for coffee on the way back to Marrakech.All in all a very pleasant day out,thanks to Jamal ."

Very professions from the email correspondence and he even called our Riad the day before to confirm! We booked the full day excursion to Ouarzazate and met at a mutually convenient location at 7.30am. Jamal was already waiting in his pristine 4x4 and made us feel very relaxed and welcome. His English is very good and he pointed out the sights en route. His driving is excellent and he made us feel very safe in rather challenging driving conditions over the High Atlas Mountains where low cloud decreased visibility to only 5 yards in front!Stops were plentiful along the way where toilets and facilities were clean and mint tea delicious! The kasbah was spectacular and great fun crossing via the stepping stones! A well run professional service. If in Marrakech don't hesitate to book this family run service."

We met Jamal on our airport transfer at the end of our time in Marrakech and it was obvious that he was very interested in our satisfaction and the quality of service from his family's company. This level of personal service you rarely find. There was a little bit of back and forth over email to confirm some of the smaller details around pickup dates/times but perhaps some of that was due to our writing style."

            "review": "Ourika Valley Trip. We decided to book this place after looking at the options on Tripadvisor. The driver/guide (Khalid) showed up promptly (early in fact) ready for our days tour just before 09:00.The car was parked around the corner, as it would have been impossible to get to our Riad down the narrow streets, but he came to the Riad to meet us, and walked us back to the car. We were the only two people on the trip, and the car was a very new Korean 4x4 style vehicle, and very comfortable.Khalid made it clear at the start of the day that the trip was our day, and he would stop where he knew the good places were to stop, but if we wanted to stop for any reason we just needed to request and he would stop for us. We saw many other tours whilst in the mountains, but these seemed more organized - and not in a good way! - there did not seem to be the flexibility on stopping where they wanted.The mountains are beautiful, and the scenery very pretty and we got some great photo opportunities. We headed down the Ourika valley - note this was December, and was supposed to be a quiet time. You could tell from the number of restaurants there, and how empty they were that this was the quiet time. In the height of season when people are escaping the heat of Marrakech for the coolness of the mountains - I can imagine it is bedlam in the mountains. We did the walk with a walking guide up the waterfalls. It was approx an hour to the halfway point, and our guide was not keen to take us for the further hour - and i'll be honest we were not that keen to go any further anyway - so we walked back to have our lunch. (Our choice - we could have eaten first if we had wished, but the walk was quite strenuous so am glad we did this way around).The lunch itself was very good, the food was superb. I was not sure if the cost of food and drink was included in the trip or not (as I could not remember) - but it was not. The restaurant was not expensive either, but it was obviously part of the tour, as it was the busiest restaurant in the area.On the way back we stopped at this herbal place. It did nothing for me, but my wife enjoyed it, and again the guy that showed us around was very knowledgeable.Khalid's English was very good, but we did between us (with my non-existent French/Arabic or Berber language!) sometimes have moments of conversation that were lost in translation. This unfortunately included when it came to making the payment at the end of the day. No cross words - and I do not believe it was intentional - we were all tired, but it meant heading back to the Riad at the end of the day to confirm the price with the guy from Riad that had booked it, and when we wrote it down on a piece of paper we were all in agreement on the price.I would recommend to the owner to perhaps supply some water to the customers in the back of the car gratis as we only took a small bottle, and we did not stop again until before lunch to get more refreshments. To be fair we did not ask to stop - but gratis water in the car would have been a nice touch.This did not detract from the day though - was definitely our favourite day in Marrakesh, and I would recommend this company to all."

Khaled the driver was on time and collected us from our Riad. The drive was very comfortable in his new 4x4. Khaled was very knowledgeable about Marrakesh as well as the valleys and villages and gave us an interesting insight of Marrakesh. He stopped wherever we wanted to take pictures and had organised his own stops at a Berber family house where we drank nice Moroccan tea and tried pure honey and home-made butter. Other stops were at places with nice panoramic views and an argon oil cooperative where we bought pure argon oil and honey. And of course we stopped for a nice lunch at one of the restaurants in ourika valley where we also linked up with Khaled's guide for the waterfall which was an amazing trek all the way up to the waterfall which took us 1 hour in total (Tip: wear good trainers/trekking shoes). Overall Khalid was a very cool, trustworthy and friendly guy who made the trip very enjoyable for us, he took many pictures for us!!! We totally recommend him especially if you are here as a couple/family and want to organize a private trip. The price was very reasonable, you are getting what you pay for, so you can't go wrong!!!"

I had initially requested Jamal\u2019s services for an excursion to Ourika Valley, which was fantastic. Jamal picked me up from my Riad in Marrakech right on time and drove me to the Atlas Mountains in his nice SUV. He showed me all the sights, including a visit to a Berber family home. Once we reached the mountains, he even hooked me up with a guide leading a group hike to the waterfalls, which was really enjoyable and cost effective. Having had such a great time, I availed of Jamal\u2019s services the next day too, which was my last day in Marrakech. I left my bags in his car and he showed me all around Marrakech, including the Bahia Palace, Saadian Tombs, Koutobia, Hammam etc. and dropped me off to the airport later. I had forgotten one of my packages in his car and he even arranged for it to be delivered to me at the airport, which speaks to his honesty and customer service. All I can say is that my trip to Morocco wouldn\u2019t have been half as enjoyable had it not been for Jamal. So thank you Jamal, and I hope you can be available whenever I am next in Morocco."

I found Jamal to be a great choice and would recommend him to everyone.I looked up a few on TA and came across EasyTake tours - I emailed Jamal and he was very responsive and gave me a very good price for our first excursion, which was a trip to Casablanca to visit the Hassan II mosque. Jamal arrived early to pick us up in his mini-van which was perfect for us, very clean and with plenty of space. We are a family of six which meant having to tumble the seats in his vehicle whenever we got in or out, which Jamal was immdeiately on hand to do.He was very polite and attentive to our needs and even suggested a few extra things to do, like having our picture taken outisde the famaous Ricks Cafe and also advising on a great place to eat along the corniche.I was so impressed with the service and value that I decied to use him for the remaining excursions, the second trip being a tour to the Atlas mountains. Again Jamal arrived ahead of time with his car cleaned from the previous day, he arranged the whole day for us with his various great contacts. We headed out early and stopped at a berber village where we met with a berber family who Jamal knew very well. We had a tour of their house and were then served a fantastic breakfast, with the best mint tea we'd ever had. We were served fresh bread, honey, olive oil and nuts - all of which were local produce and tasted fantastic. We were then taken to the next stop which was a berber village at the base of the Atlas mountains, here we met another friend of Jamal - whose name was also Jamal. He was a young berber guide who took us through the Ourika valley to the first waterfall and then upwards again and finally back to his village. The younger Jamal was also very good and really took care of us through our climb which was challenging in places.We used Jamal a third time to arrange a couple of activities around Marrakech - the girls wanted a spa treatment and the boys wanted to go quad biking. Again Jamal looked after us arranging everything without fuss and at a very reasonable price.Our final excursion was to Essouria, again Jamal arrived well ahead of time and we headed out to Essouria. We stopped along the way at a cafe and also at an Argan oil co-operative, where we had a tour of a small factory producing argan oil products. We then went to Essouria, where we stayed the whole day with Jamal waiting for us.On our last day in Marrakech Jamal also arranged one of his drivers to provide a taxi service for us around a couple of places in Marrakech, since he was busy with another tour. However, he did finally pick us up from our hotel to take us to the airport for our return flight in the evening.Overall, I was very impressed with Jamal, great manners, much more than just a transport service and never did I feel that I was under any pressure to buy additional services - as was often the case with other situations in Marrakesh. Great value for money, reliable, genuine and honest."

Our guide showed us a lot of a nice and new things for us and we spoke with him during our way up and down. He explained us the Morrocan culture and tradition as well as showed us a loot of birds. We could spend the whole day in nice company and enjoyed the nature. It was an amazing time. During the way up we had a break for Morrocan tea and amazing dates. When we finished the trip, the late lunch was waiting for as in Riad Jnane Imlil located in Douar Targa Imoula, Imlil. The food was amazing and we returned the empty dishes. We really recommend this company. Don't worry that the prices are higher than in other companies but you are sure that you will get a good quality."

Our favourite day was hiking in the Atlas Mountains and spending a night at the wonderful Riad Imlil Jiane. The scenery and sights were spectacular, however it would have been good to be able to spend a little more time at certain places. The staff were generous and made us feel very welcome on our trip. Overall a great experience - thank you very much!"

Atlas and Sahara tours were awesome - they carefully helped us plan hiking , cycling and mule riding - they completely went out thier way to make sure we were fully taken care off. Would totally recommend them for all activities - they are very knowledgeable - in addition to this you MUST visit ( and stay as long as you can ) in their the riad they are partnered with ( jnane imlil) , awesome people , delicious food and what rooms and views - planning more trips there Thank you Hassan , his brother , uncles and the mules for an totally unforgettable expirence - HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"

We were promptly collected from our riad in the Medina. Hassan provided us with a well paced, friendly and informative tour. However, the scenery has been spoilt by the large amount of rubbish around the village and waterfall. A constant stream of tourists going in and out made walking difficult and took away from the idea of a remote and peaceful landmark. I understand that this is not the responsibility of the tour company, but visitors should be aware. In addition, the trek is only suitable for those physical able and reasonably fit."

My partner and I booked a day trip with this company during our time in Marrakech and it was by far the best experience of the entire trip. Mustafa and his team plan every detail of the trip to ensure you not only get to experience the sense of community, the truly stunning surrounds but also the hospitable nature of those who call the Atlas mountains home. We have done numerous tours, but our tour guide Mohammed was by far the best we have ever experienced. He had a true passion for the role and the area through which he guided us which really brought the experience to life. This tour is all about really getting a sense of the life in the Atlas, it's about experiencing the mountain climbs and the way of the people. It honestly provided a whole new view of Morocco and we can't wait to return and spend time with the team again. We were collected from our hotel at 10am driven in a beautiful vehicle to the Atlas Mountains. Here we met our amazing guide Mohammed, we truly was the best guide EVER. We has a beautiful trek through the mountains and then a meal at the most beautiful Riad in the world. We were then driven to the location of the camels where we had a beautiful ride with them.If you're looking for a truly life changing experience with a company that understands and is passionate about what they do, this is the company. Wewould not have seen the Atlas any other way! Thank you so much to the team (especially Mohammed)."

This time my partner and I were picked up at the airport by the lovely Hassan. He dropped us off at our first riad in central Marrakech. The next day we headed up to Imlil, again courtesy of Hassan. I was really pleased to meet up with Mustapha again and even more overjoyed to learn that Mohammed, the guide who led our Toubkal trek a few years ago, would again be working with us. We all hugged, loaded up our gear and headed off for the hills. The new Toubkal refuge is an improvement on the old one. We ate and chatted with other trekkers at the refuge and then caught an early night ready for the 4am wake up call. With head torches and crampons on we headed up into the snow and ice. We had no issues with altitude sickness this time and we made it up and down in good time. We then stayed at a lovely riad in Imlil with Mustapha and another riad in central Marrakech, again all arranged by Mustapha. Imlil and Marrakech are special places for us; the sights, the smells and sounds are a joy to behold. But it's the people that have made it special for us, particularly Mohammed, Hassan and Mustapha. A huge thank you."

We had opted for the 4 hour walk, but trimmed it down to 3 hours as it was an extremely hot day. We were picked up by Hussain at our Riad, who drove us down to Imlil. We then met our guide Mohammad in Imlil, who took us around the lower edges of the mountains which surround Imlil, as well as to the waterfall close by. Note you will need proper walking shoes, as it is quite rocky in places and steep and you may need to walk through the small waterfalls. Both were friendly, but their English was limited which we didn't mind. Lunch was at the Riad Jname Imlil, where we had a delicious 3 course lunch which included a beef tangine. This was possibly the best meal we had whilst we were in Morocco! We then met Mustapha who is one of the brothers who own the company (and Riad). He showed us around the Riad and the different and unique rooms which you could stay in. A day probably doesn't do the place justice, but you do get to enjoy the stunning scenery. We did regret not spending a night and going for another walk, so if you like nature, stay another day."

Mohammed was our tour guide and is now our friend, I truly hope that we cross paths again as he was absolutely fantastic and really does know the history of his local area in the Atlas Mountains. We started the day by getting picked up by the lovely Rachid in his 4x4 car, he came and called for us at our Riad which was close to the markets (where you couldn't drive down to). We then stopped to get some water brought by Rachid and then got the chance the take photos at whichever spots we wanted him to stop at... We then met Mohammed at a cafe (for more tasty Moroccan tea of course) opposite where our camels were waiting for us, my female camel 'Fatima' and my partners camel got on very well and the camel handler adored them and clearly looked after them well. Mohammed was continuously educating us all day, and we loved every story and fact.After our camel ride (your thighs will hurt after 1.5 hours hehe! - but it's worth it!) we stopped at the local Saturday market (very old Sch but such an awesome experience) where Mohammed's father was too, we ended up buying two matching hand made traditional dresses to wear for the rest of the day - such good times. This was something extra, Mohammed did not have to show us this market. We then met back with our driver Rachid who drove us all to Imlil for a break. We had a wonderful meal at the Riad Imlil which is by far the best view I've had whilst eating lunch! So peaceful and calming. The waiter was very friendly too. We got to wear the camel leather slippers too which then led to my partner buying a pair later on in the mountains! After we had eaten and got the chance to have a nosey around the Riad rooms, which were very quaint peaceful and seemed a honeymoon style of place to stay, we headed off for our 2.5 walking trek up in the mountains past the villages, right until the last one.Again, we cannot stress how much fun we had and will never forget this day.In the local Berber language if you say 'ten minutes' quite quickly this is basically how you say thank you ;) (was my way of remembering)Don't forget to wear comfortable shoes for the trek!

My husband and eldest daughter (age 12) were both very well catered for with their gluten free diets. Everything was understood and clearly passed on to chefs at all the restaurants and Riads where we were. Mohamed, our tour guide for the full 5 days, looked after us in the Sahara Desert and High Atlas Mountains. We always had plenty of delicious food to eat and a constant supply of bottled water. He ensured our 10 year old daughter was happy but sensitively gave us plenty of space too. Our enjoyment of the trip and welfare were top priorities and the people we met along the way we're warm and friendly. Mohamed's understanding of English is outstanding. Morocco is vast, beautiful and safe and well worth exploring. It offers great value for money, is fascinating, unspoilt and a world away from home. Brilliant memories we will treasure, we all loved it We hope to return to climb North Africa's highest peak, Mount Toubkal in the High Atlas Mountians as it is relatively accessible to all, not just experienced climbers! Can't wait. Tour date: 30/5 - 3/6/16"

We met Omar our guide at the camel station in Asni. He was incredibly courteous and thoughtful to ensure our trip met our expectations. Also very knowledgable and multi-lingual, we felt safe in his hands. Our camel ride was very pleasant! Hassan met us at the other end with the car and then he and Omar accompanied us to Imlil. Lunch was provided at the Riad Jnane- beautiful in every respect and a welcome rest with breath taking scenery. After food we trekked to the highest Berber village this side of Mt Toubkal with Omar leading the way offering regular local info and interesting facts- he really is a superb guide! Never too fast uphill, always checking we were comfortable with the pace and always mindful of water in the heat. About 2.5hrs in total bringing us back to the car in Imlil village. We returned safely back to Marrakech with even a considerate stop at a women's cooperative for Argan oil after an earlier conversation asking about fair trade purchases. They were the perfect hosts! Also our thanks to Mustapha- all organised online with promptness and care. Well done Atlas & Sahara- we hope to return!"

We went on two day tours with Atlas and Sahara, the first being the one day tour to Imlil Valley and a couple days later we went to Ait Benhaddou and Telouet. Both tours were great and beautifully organised, but the hike in Imlil Valley definitely was the highlight of my week in Morocco. Both mornings, we were picked up at our riad on time and dropped off as planned every evening. Mustafa, who runs the company, is a very nice, friendly man and he is very responsive to emails. He also owns Riad Jnane Imlil, which is a gorgeous Riad in the heart of Imlil Valley. While we did not lodge there, we had an amazing lunch at the rooftop and I would definitely recommend it as overnight stay to people who want to hike/explore Imlil for two or more days. Our hike was about 2.5/3 hours long and it was definitely not difficult, just make sure you wear running or hiking shoes as the path can be a little rough at times. You get an amazing view of the mountains and our guide, Hassan, is a really nice guy. He was born in Imlil so he knows the area a lot, and he can adapt to your walking pace. He never pressured us and was very supportive when we stopped to take pictures. He also took some for us!The second tour (to Ait Benhaddou) involves a very long drive to and from the Ksar. While you are busy for the whole day, you actually spend only a few hours there. This was expected, and it is still definitely worth doing. Even the car ride is entertaining because the landscape is simply beautiful and scenery changes a lot. Overall, I had a great experience with Atlas and the Sahara and I would definitely recommend this company and its tours to anyone!"

Our guide was Faisal...we have had many guides throughout the world but he ranked along with the best. A personable young guy, he had the knack of being able to give us sufficient information without overloading us and was always ready to give detailed responses to the questions we had. He certainly enlightened us about many aspects of Morroccan life. We stopped at a kasbah in Telouet where he gave us a guided tour before reaching Ait Ben Haddou itself where we had lunch, included in the price. There were 5 set meals and we could choose what we wanted, though all began with either salad or soup and ended with an orange and dates....a pleasant, filling meal. Afterwards, Faisal gave us a conducted tour of the kasbah and we had the joy of meeting a very elderly lady, one of only five families still to live in the kasbah, who enabled us to tour round her house...even better was the fact that Faisal had stayed with her a few times before as she was his friend's grandmother. That sort of personal touch really adds to a visit! The ever changing scenery on the journey was fascinating and well worth the day out in itself."

All the stops we have made, they all have clean toilet and clean food. Before we have booked, we didn't realise how long it takes to go to Zagora. It is about 7 hours drive with 1 hour rest. The slight is amazing on the way! The atlas is so beautiful, and full of colours."

            "review": "Fantastic, personalised trip! . We had 4 days in Marrakech and knew we wanted to spend some time walking near the Atlas Mountains. We researched a few companies and Atlas and Sahara Day Tours came out on top as they offered such a variety of trips to individual groups.We wanted to spend as much time as possible walking and exploring the foothills so the fact that we drove direct from Marrakech to Imlil Valley was perfect - we have been on trips in the past where there are many stops on the way to see shops, markets, villages etc. While this may appeal to some people, it wasn't what we wanted this time so we were delighted with this.We met our guide Mohammad and chose the walk length suitable for us. The setting is beautiful, the cherry and apple trees were in bloom which really set off the views! Mohammad was a fantastic guide, he answered all our questions, was very friendly and even took us to his house for tea!The lunch provided on the roof top at the Riad was delicious and had unbeatable views! My partner is interested in returning to climb the mountains so we were shown the rooms in the Riad and they are beautiful!Mustapha was extremely helpful when emailing to arrange the trip and was friendly and welcoming when we arrived at the Riad. If anyone is interested in climbing/days of trekking, the options are very customisable by the sounds of it! I think at least one of us will definitely be returning! (I may just come for the view and leave the climbing to my other half!)I would highly recommend Atlas and Sahara Tours to anyone travelling to Marrakech for a day trip (at least!) it's an idyllic setting away from the hustle and bustle with a variety of options including treks, walks, donkey rides etc - it's not just for active climbers!Hopefully we will be back in the not too distant future!

We only went to Marrakech for a long weekend, but having seen that in this short space of time we could go on a trip through the mountains and ride camels through the valley, we jumped at the chance to explore beyond Marrakech. It was so easy to book, and Mustapha replies to emails so quickly, and leaves no questions unanswered. It was all very clear and he was incredibly helpful. We had a driver pick us up from our hotel on the dot. The drive was very comfortable, and landmarks were pointed out. Our guide, Mohammed, was FANTASTIC. Ensure we did a trek that would suit our ability, and was incredibly friendly and helpful. The camel ride in the afternoon was great fun too, albeit a little uncomfortable, but camel's aren't particularly comfortable to ride! Lunch in the Riad with the breathtaking view, all very authentic and delicious! I cannot recommend this company enough, so much so that I am going back in September to climb Mount Toubkal.

We really couldn't have asked for anything more, from the moment we met Rashid at our Riad in Marrakech when he personally came to pick us up and walk us back through the maze of the Souk to our vehicle, until our drop off in Fes 4 days later when they both ensured we were met by our guide to our Riad. The vehicle was excellent; spacious, clean and air con in perfect working order! and driving was to a high, safe standard!They made us feel safe, looked after us, educated us on many aspects of life in Morocco. They respected our privacy but also interacted with us; we enjoyed friendly conversation and many laughs! And the music... What a soundtrack they provided us with! Just perfect... and even provoked a few tears upon leaving the desert. Such incredible memories, ones that will be treasured forever.They went above and beyond and exposed us to experiences that weren't part of our already incredible itinerary such as meeting and exploring a Nomadic Camp whilst driving to our next destination; stopping off to pick up and purchase us a Tinariwen CD having expressed our enjoyment of the band back here at home. So many personable touches were made.We can't forget our contact made with Mustapha either! From the moment we e-mailed to get an idea of what we wanted to do until the very day of our trip his communication was excellent! Fast, informative and really appreciated!We really didn't want our trip to end and honestly felt a little sad when it did! We had thoroughly enjoyed our time with them and the experiences we had. We would certainly recommend your company to anyone thinking of touring Morocco! Thank you again for such an incredible experience and we hope to one day be back again!!"

Our guide Ahmed is very knowledgeable about the area and we enjoyed talking to him. He was great with our kids and even took us to the bus station to buy our onward tickets.

He had made several suggestions and I chose a day trip and an overnight. I have to admit, maybe because I live in New York City, I'm a bit paranoid and skeptical. I really didn't want to send the deposit because I was nervous it was a scam, but I decided that they had such a good reputation on Trip Advisor, that I would do it. I was then asked to pay the balance in cash on our first day in Marrakech - the alarm bells started ringing for me. I REALLY did not want to do that. It turned out, that we ended up paying him in the middle of the trip and I'm sure if I had expressed my concerns, we could have done it at the end. Mustapha was great and fast to respond during our correspondence and by the time I met him, felt like he was a friend. We were picked up exactly when we were supposed to and spent several days with our guide Mohammed and our driver Hassan. Mohammed was the nicest, kindest guide who always took into account that we were 6 people ages 12 through 80 and was always able to adjust activities for the individuals in our group. They took such good care of us during our trips and we really felt glad that we could help support the local economy. My kids have decided that their camel trip was one of their favorite things they did, and our lunch at Mustapha's riad was one of the best meals we had. The area is so beautiful and really unexpected for me, as I didn't realize that Morocco would have such a bountiful Garden of Eden."

We met Mustapha too and he was friendly and happy to chat to us all about life in Morocco. We did the 2 day trek to Toubkal with a great guide (Lasson) and a 2 day tour around Southern Morocco and the Atlas Mountains with Hassan. Both guides were fantastic and looked after us well. On the way to Marrakech, Mustapha checked that we had accommodation and offered to book us somewhere. We already had accommodation booked but appreciated his offer and thought. When we arrived home from our holiday, Mustapha sent us a follow up email to check we had enjoyed ourselves. The customer service and organisation from Atlas and Sahara was perfect. When we return to Morocco, Atlas and Sahara will be our first choice!"

Such preparations as we made for our long weekend in Marrakech were done in a hurry the day before we went and involved a glance at the reviews followed by a brief exchange of emails with Mustapha. I told him where our riad was, that we'd like to walk in the mountains and said be ready to be collected at 9 a.m. It hardly seemed enough for him to go on and he didn't even ask for a deposit, so I wasn't sure that anything would come of it. As it turned out, Hassan, the driver was punctual ( found us with no problem despite the chaos that is Marrakech ) and, though very young, was careful and competent to the point that we didn't have to give our safety a second thought. The Imlil Valley was just spectacular and Mohammed, our guide as we trekked, was a superb companion. Knowledgeable, friendly and unintrusive. We were offered walks of 1, 2, 3 or 4 hours. We opted for 3 and afterwards were fed fantastically ( though they don't do booze out in the mountains so no glass of wine or beer ). We had such a great day we did another tour a day or two later, this time to Ait Benhaddou, beyond the Atlas Mountains, in the direction of the desert, where they shoot the films. This time we were driven by Rashid, who was ace, and we had another Mohammed to guide us. Again, a really, really nice person and excellent teacher who it was just nice to have around. We tipped 100 Derhams, which seemed to be gratefully received.Two quickly improvised days that brought Morocco alive for us and which we'll remember forever."

Over the next 4 days and 3 nights, we went to Berber villages, Ait Ben-haddou, Dades Gorges, Todra Gorges, Merzouga, Erg Chhebi then back through Ouarzazate to Marrakech... the pinnacle was the night we spent in the desert in Erg Chhebi! Children (and us adults as well) will never forget the camel-riding experience! We stayed in very nice places, had very nice local food and had so much fun & laugh... Rachid had been amazing!

There were 7 of us travelling (4 adults and my 3 daughters) and we all agree this tour was the absolute highlight of our 2 week Moroccan holiday! Firstly, the van was very comfortable, clean and safe. We had Jamal as a driver and Hassan as our guide. Both of whom are lovely guys and were very considerate to the fact we were travelling with small children. Hassan was an excellent guide and very knowledgeable. My only suggestion would be that he get a microphone for the back seat passengers. My parents found it difficult to hear when he explained things en route (which was quite a lot). Also, he is a very chatty guy and would talk to the driver non stop, which made it hard to interrupt to ask questions!The highlight of the highlight though was going by camel to the nomadic camp in the Sahara Desert and then sleeping through a sand storm. My children will be talking about that experience for the rest of their lives! And camping will never be good enough for my 4 year old again unless we arrive and depart by camel!! And we loved staying in Imlil which was just gorgeous at this time of year with all the snow. We met Mustapha there who had arranged the whole tour by email with me and was always very prompt replying to my questions and concerns before the trip.Thank you Mustapha, Jamal and Hassan! You showed us a beautiful part of your country and gave us some wonderful memories! I highly recommend these guys!!"

The kasbah is now a semi-ruin, but still very well worth visiting. Atlas & Sahara Day Tours provided me with an English-speaking guide, a Toyota Land Cruiser and a Berber driver so that my wife and I could follow the Maxwell trail and explore this remarkable mountain fastness and its high Atlas surroundings. Jamal was a faultless and considerate driver and Rashid was by far the best and most thoughtful guide I have ever experienced. He was seriously interested in our subject and went to great trouble to translate and explain the whole Berber culture and their struggles both during and since the French colonial period. Nothing was too much trouble. I cannot recommend this company highly enough."

He also imparted so much information that really informed us so much about Morocco and also made us reflect on a few other things. How nice it was to see kids playing out, playing football with empty bottles and doing hopscotch in a village where many houses have no electricity. And how polite they were. Almost every child we passed said 'bonjour' to us. When we reached the top the views into the stunning into the valley and looking over the villages.

We are a couple from Finland and we took 4 days tour which included for example one night at the Sahara and trekking in the Atlas mountains. Our expectations were really high, because of the excellent reviews of the Atlas and Sahara Day Tour. Even so, we were positively surprised and 100% satisfied with our tour.Booking a tour was really easy and Mustapha answered every e-mail really fast and with good English. From our tour it is impossible to name just one highlight of our tour because we had so many unforgettable moments! We saw really amazing places, met nice people, learnt much about Moroccan and Berber culture, ate really delicious food and stayed in wonderfully situated riads. Besides we loved our guide Mohamed, he is absolutely the best guide that you can have!! If you are going to Morocco, you should definitely attend a tour by Atlas and Sahara Tours. There is no way you could spend money better.Vaikka odotukset olivatkin korkealla, niin Atlas and Sahara Tour t\u00e4ytti ja jopa ylitti ne! Olimme 4 p\u00e4iv\u00e4n kierroksella, joka kattoi muun muassa y\u00f6n Saharassa sek\u00e4 vaelluksen Atlas-vuorilla. On mahdotonta tosin mainita vain muutama matkan huippukohta, sill\u00e4 niit\u00e4 oli niin paljon! Oppaamme Mohamed oli aivan loistava tyyppi, h\u00e4n piti meist\u00e4 eritt\u00e4in hyv\u00e4\u00e4 huolta ja opetti meille eritt\u00e4in paljon marokko- ja berberikulttuureista. Suosittelemme eritt\u00e4in l\u00e4mpim\u00e4sti, ehdottomasti loistavaa vastinetta rahalle!-Jesse&Jenna"

            "review": "1 day walk and camel ride. We only had a long weekend in Marrakech, but wanted to get out of the city for the day. The email communication was excellent, the guide and driver were right on time and we felt this was great value for money. We did the one day excursion -- a circular walk from Mustapha's Riad through the Berber villages. I can imagine in spring the view would be even better! It was Jan. so a little dry, but so nice to see the countryside and villages. Our guide, Rasheed, answered all our questions and his English was amazing. He was a pleasure to spend the day with and so kind. We had lunch at the Riad (delicious) and then a camel ride. I really wanted to ride the camels (husband not so keen). It was well organized and a fine thing to do, but you are riding on the camels in a dry-ish river bed which follows the main road. You aren't right beside the road, but I felt a bit foolish on the camel and so felt a bit ridiculous. Mind you, this was totally me! The actual camel ride and experience was great. I think if you REALLY want to ride a camel, then book it (as I REALLY wanted to ride and don't know when/if I will again). They are really amazing animals. But I think I might have actually enjoyed a full day trek a bit more. But again, this was down to my decision. The company gave me exactly what I asked for and more. Would book with them again...highly recommend!"

They deserve a most detailed review from us as we travelled 30 countries and never had the service and experience this company provided for us. All of the tours we made is private. They provided us excellent 4x4 ride, with driver and tour guide. We are grateful to Mohammed (tour guide) who offered and make everything we asked. During the trip he took hundreds of pictures and i have uploaded some here. some of them are now priceless as we couldn't get them otherwise.Tour 1: One Day Tour to Addaden valley Day trip, undiscovered Atlas Mountains.This trip is mostly thru the dirt road going up the mountain, and we ended up with the breathtaking scenery, visited local souk (marketplace), berbers village. There were many more stops during the trip, stopped for tea break and find the simplicity of Moroccan life.Tour 2: Three days Sahara trip to Merzouga. This is the most popular Sahara tour to get the best. 2 nights accommodations and meals was good. Many stops on the way, including Kasbah. Tour 3: One day trip to Essaouira. We made the trip as we had an extra day, and thought to be in another part of Morocco. This coast line city with fishing market and old Medina is a beautiful place to visit. Eat fresh fish, walk by the sea is different than climbing up the Atlas Mt.We started our booking early, and the owner, Mustapha was excellent who communicated with us in daily basis, provided us all the info we needed. I am thankful to them. When we finished our tour with Mohammed (tour guide) and Rashid (driver), the moment was emotional, and all of us felt and become friend during our visit. My wife left her shoes in the hotel near Sahara, and Mustapha ad his team managed to get those shoes back to us when we were leaving Marrakech airport. I am not sure where else on the planet we can get this service. Many thanks guys...my friends will visit Morocco with you."

Mustapha was so understanding and flexible in making a trip that suited me- nothing was a bother.I decided on the 1/2 day trek in the Atlas Mountains (Asni Valley and Imlil) from Agadir and then to Marrakech overnight and to return back to Agadir. Rasheed, our driver picked us up from our hotel in Agadir and took us over the Atlas Mountains. He is a fantastic guy and his English was good and had very knowledgeable. A very comfortable journey in a 4 x 4 through out and most importantly with a careful driver too!The meal in the riad was prepared by Omar, something we will never forget - the experience was unique, authentic and so delicious probably one of our nicest meals on the holiday.We walked through a few villages and had plenty of chances to enjoy the great landscapes and definitely needed after such a feast. Lahcen our guide was from one of the villages we hiked through, and he had many interesting stories about life there. A lovely guy who constantly looking out to see if we were ok and happy to change the route to an easier trek.The service we received throughout was very professional and I would highly recommend Atlas & Sahara tours for exploring the Atlas Mountains. I would love to go back with more time in the future and I would definitely book through Atlas & Sahara tours again!Thank you Mustapha, Rasheed, Omar and Lachen."

His communications were always prompt and his suggestions very helpful. We were picked up in Marrakech and driven through the mountains to Asni where we met our guide Mohamed Maachou and then travelled on to to Riad Jnane. On arrival, we had tea on the beautiful terrace of the riad, with a spectacular view of the mountains in the background. The decor within the riad also is quite breathtaking, with beautifully painted ceilings and colourful tiles on walls and floors. Our rooms contained all that we might need with air conditioning for the cold evenings.Delicious meals of salads and tangines were prepared each day by Omar who also showed us how to make a vegetable tagine. Everyone at the riad is so friendly and accommodating which made our stay there so special. Mohamed planned two easy walks for us during our trip as one of the family is 81 years old. The first to Aremd involved walking on quite steep slopes. Mimi the mule accompanied us and offered an easier way to travel for my husband\u2019s mother. On day two we walked to Tamatert and had tea with a young family in their home. The scenery is so beautiful, the air so clear and Mohamed provides an knowledgeable and extremely interesting insight into life within the villages.Such a short trip but so many delightful experiences."

We contacted Atlas and Sahara Day Tours before leaving the States. They were very responsive to our questions and presented themselves as a professional company. We were met promptly by a driver at our lodging in Marrakesh in the morning. He drove us up into the Atlas Mountains in a nice SUV and drove in a safe manner. Once we arrived at the riad, we were met by the owner of the company. He was very friendly and we enjoyed speaking with him. The best part of the trip was the flexibility. The first snow of the year happened during our stay. The storm impacted our itinerary, but the company was very flexible and allowed us to switch the dates that we stayed near the riad and the dates we were supposed to hike to a nearby village. Our guide to the village was great. He spoke excellent English and was fun to talk to. It was nice that we got to just carry our day packs while the rest of our gear and the food supplies were carried by a mule. The hike to the village wasn't too strenuous, but lasted several hours. The village itself was nice and peaceful. There were no cars and the villagers still lived relatively traditionally. There wasn't much for us to do once we got to the village, but it was probably good for us to unwind a bit and just relax.At the end of our two day tour, we met again with the owner and he again welcomed us and was eager to hear about our trip and ask if there was anything that his company could do to improve the experience. I would highly recommend this company for people looking for a couple of days away from the big city and seeking a nice outdoor experience."

Took it slowly, lots of stops for water and photos. Even so I slipped on the scree, banging my knee.Coming down is always more difficult and this time my husband slipped (parts were extremely loose underfoot) necessitating clinic, hospital, repatriation, operation, leg brace for 6-8 weeks. I feel this could have been avoided with a little more detail of the walk involved. We would have taken our proper walking boots.Would I use this company again. Actually - Yes!I cannot fault the organisation, lunch looked fantastic (unfortunately we could not take full advantage of it) Mustapha's brother stayed with us at the clinic and also went to the hospital with us.

We were a party of 4.Mohammed explained that we were going on a circular walk into the lower Atlas mountains. The ascent was sometimes steep and Mohammed kept the pace just right so that we could stay together. My wife did find this hard work & Mohammed would ensure that we had regular stops to rest and drink water. The views were stunning.On our way down, we went via a small waterfall which was full of Moroccans having a great time. We stopped for about 15 minutes for a rest and to take pictures. Mohammed had brought along extra water for us.Mohammed took us to the Riad Jnane Imlil where we had a huge lunch. Our starter was a whole variety of salad followed by chicken tanjine. Dessert was fruit. We were really stuffed. The cost was DH 150 per person which was excellent value.Once we had finished lunch, our driver took us back to our RiadAn absolutely enjoyable day out which was all down to our guide Mohammed taking us into the mountains at a easy pace.Really worth doing."

The chef cooked the best food we had whilst in Morocco!The hikes from the Riad were wonderful and not too strenuous and everything was very well organised. Would highly recommend using these guys."

This tour was great from start to finish, with our original booking with Mustapha an easy and efficient process. Mohammed our guide and Rachid our driver could not have been better. They were both extremely knowledgeable. Mohammed was engaging and full of information for every place we visited. Both Mohammed and Rachid had great insights into the different areas of Morocco, combining their extensive knowledge of the area with their personal experiences and way of life. Both went above and beyond for all of needs and concerns. When we fell ill, Mohammed did everything to ensure we were comfortable and we were both very grateful. The tour itself is incredible, photos don't do the places justice. Highlights include the nomadic camp and camel ride into he sunset in the Sahara, the drive through the Atlas Mountains and the Dandes and Toudra gorges and the beautiful hike through Imlil.We thoroughly enjoyed our tour and would recommend it as a must do for anyone visiting Morocco.

What a great service - Mustafa was able to balance the needs of both my husband and myself so that we both had a walk to suit our different abilities - a shorter one for me then an amazing lunch at the riad, followed by a more exertive walk for him while I enjoyed a quiet time on the terrace. We had a glimpse at a traditional village and culture and a wonderful day in the High Altas.

Arranging this trek was such an easy process as Mustapha was always very helpful and prompt when answering questions. We cannot praise our guide Mohammed enough, who was simply fantastic! He was very articulate whether he was speaking in Arabic or English and extremely knowledgeable in the history of the villages that we passed during our trek and its people. He is proud of his berber culture and rightly so as they are amazing people who make everyone that visits Morocco feel very welcomed. So thank you!We also have to say a big thank you again to Rachid and Syed who also accompanied us during our trek. They had an extremely long day that started at 5am with them bringing the camels to our starting point and also having to look after them and guide them during our trek.The camel ride itself was incredible, the views were stunning and really showed the true beauty of Morocco- this was by far our best day of our holiday! Following the 4 hour camel trek we had a lovely tangine at Riad Jhane Imlil (so big thanks to chef again).The hotel itself is amazing with beautiful views of the Atlas Mountains. All in all this was a fantastic experience that we will never forget and we look forward to planning more treks with Altas and Sahara tours next time we are in Morocco."

Mohamed and his driver (sorry - can't remember his name - great fellow though) were right on time to pick us up in Marrakech. The camel ride was very interesting and was point-to-point through farmland and national park. I was afraid that it would be just a short loop, but was happy that we covered some ground. Mohamed gave fantastic information about the people and landscape of this part of Morocco. After, we had a fantastic lunch at the company's beautiful riad in Imlil before doing a 2 hour hike in the area. Throughout we had great views of the mountains and small villages in the valley and saw many interesting sights. Overall, the company and Mohamed are highly recommended. Next time I am in Morocco, I hope to do a multi-day trip in the area with this company."

I always prefer to use a local company rather than a US or foreign owned one when travelling, but it can be risky. With the Atlas I experienced the absolute best of Morocco with caring, knowledgeable guides for our 5 day tour, who went way beyond the itinerary in providing services. For instance after the airline lost my daughter's bag, our guide Hassan made multiple extra trips to the airport, used local contacts and did everything possible to help us retrieve it, even after the trip ended his efforts didn't stop. In addition to giving us a fascinating authentic experience, they made travelling pleasant easy and seemless by having crunched all the details and and anticipating our needs.While we regrettably didn't not stay at the Atlas hotel Inmlil, Mustapha invited us to be his guest for a absolutely delicious dinner under the stars in his spectacularly beautiful new hotel. Can't wait to visit again. This time I will take them to the Sahara"

It was the first time my children had done anything like this, and my first time in Morocco. It was extraordinary. They bent over backwards to look after us and made the children feel utterly at home. The tour was amazing, treking up to remote villages and on the second day our mountain guide helped us to climb one of the peaks, encouraging and helping the children all the way to the top. What makes this company stand out though was the attention to detail: as well as the essentials, our guide had in his backpack Moroccan biscuits and nuts for the children, Moroccan tea to boil at the mountain peak, spare socks, everything we could have ever needed. Our guide was also incredibly knowledgeable, not just about the mountains, but about the history of Morocco, Islam and the local area. It was a fascinating two days and I cannot recommend or thank the guide enough."

For peace of mind we booked this trip before travelling to Morocco. We were picked up (just us two) by a driver and guide and taken to Imil in the high atlas. Here we went to the Riad that Mustapha owns for a freshen up and some mint team of the roof terrace over looking Mount Toukbal. Mohamed (a very pleasant, knowledge, local, friendly guide) then led is around a 3 hour hike where we really experienced the mountains, local villages and local people. Mohamed couldn't do enough to help, he knew everyone (!) and even bought us some fresh fruit for the top! We then had a really generous lunch back at the Riad with salad, lentil Tagine, chicken Tagine and cous cous and flat bread. It was delicious! The Riad is stunning and the location amazing. We then got driven back down the valley for a camel trek along the (mainly) dried up river bed. This was a great experience and was quite exciting because of the terrain and water splashes. We were then driven back to the hotel. Mohamed was outstanding and we really enjoyed spending time with him. The experience was genuinely off the beaten track and the local knowledge of the guide was great. This have us the best insight into the real Morrocco of our whole holiday. The heart of this people is to involve more local people in tourism and to share the benefits of tourism with the local people. A sustainable and responsible approach which benefits everyone. We would love to do more tours with the company in the future - and wholeheartedly recommend them to you."

To be greeted by Mustapha half way up a mountain pass with a freshly cooked tagine and salad is something to be experienced.

Rashid couldn't have been a nicer guide, he was always there to help, chatted along the way and we learnt a lot about his way of life.

Mustapha understood our requirements and was responsive and helpful with the booking. Our guide Hassan was knowledgeable, fun and ensured our experience was the best. Our provisions and back packs were looked after by another Hassan who walked ahead with the mule each day to prepare our wonderful tasty meals. The Berber house in the mountain village and the valley riad which we stayed in were perfect. I would highly recommend Atlas and Sahara Tours, I will definitely be going back. Thank you for such a wonderful time."

As we were a family group of 9 people aged between 18 and 81 we needed a tour to suit us all. Pick up was prompt and travel to the mountains safe and comfortable. Our guide Mohammed was friendly and his English good. We were also accompanied by Ibrahim and Abdul and their two trusty mules. During our walk we were all so cared for. In typical Brit style we didn't really have the right footwear on but we were all guided and helped when necessary. We were especially touched by the care given to our older members. Lunch was incredible and the Riad exquisite. We all considered our day excellent value. As it was my mums 80 th birthday the next day we were so touched again when Mohammed presented her with a gorgeous top and scarf. An absolutely brilliant trip."

The trek was great fun and we had an awesome tour guide. We wanted to keep the tour private for just myself and my boyfriend and Mustapha was very accommodating with this. I would certainly book this day trip again, I could not recommend this enough."

We were collected from our riad in Marrakech by a polite and friendly driver and driven to the foothills of the Atlas mountains where we were collected by our guide Muhammad. Because my partner is allergic to horses, they kindly moved our camels away from the main mounting point (where there were quite a few horses), and we got on from there.We enjoyed a lovely couple of hours riding through the breathtaking agricultural landscape and Berber villages, before being taken by car further up the mountains where we met Mustapha - who is just adding the finishing touches to his new guesthouse - which looks like it is going to be a fantastic place to stay when complete. We then ate some lunch, and headed off on a 2 hour hike at a leisurely and enjoyable pace, where we saw the tallest peak in North Africa right in front of us.Our guide was polite and incredibly knowledgeable - he adapted well to suit our pace of walking.Of course, you can't see a huge amount in just a day tour - but we definitely got a good feel for what life in the mountains is like. A perfect introduction for a more in depth experience - the next time we return! Highly recommended."

We did a two day trek through the Atlas Mountains. Our guide, Mohammad, had a very high level of English and was keen to tell us all about the area and their culture. We learnt so much from him and thoroughly enjoyed sharing stories with him. The walk was great, a good mixture of uphill and flat with stunning views. Mohammad was very willing to take pictures of us, always ensuring the great views were captured as well. We stopped for lunch and were expecting a sandwich or something similar considering how remote we were. We were taken aback when a gorgeous meatball tagine arrived with pasta and fresh salad. We felt very well looked after and refuelled for the next leg of the journey. We stayed overnight with a local villager which was another fantastic experience. Getting to speak to locals through Mohammad was such a pleasure. We were once again very pleasantly surprised by the food prepared by the guides with such limited resources. Mohammad said to us that we weren\u2019t tourists we were his guests, and that is the best way that I can sum up how we felt.

We booked a trip for 3 days to explore the valleys beyond Quarzazate towards Merzouga, a cable trip and overnight stay in the desert and the trip back to Quarzazate. This area is rich in nature, geology, history and culture, but unfortunately our guide was a driver, not a guide. We did not get any sponteous information and even when questioned, he did not have much knowledge, actually less than our guide book. This was rather disappointing, since our understanding was that we had booked a guided trip. The driver was speaking on the phone most of the time he was driving and made sure to meet his friends when we met other groups (which we frequently did, at most lunch stops and night stops. The desert trip included a big group and we had to walk to meet returning camels because the company was overbooked. Just do not have too many romantic notions about this Sahara experience.Otherwise, the country is beautiful and we learned a lot about the history and their way of building Kasbahs in the end from other guides. Tip: Take the trip but make sure you get an english speaking guide, which are apparently rare at this company! Or rent a trip mor close to the area wherer the guides have more local knowledge of the flora/fauna/traditions etc."

Muhammad our guide was fantastic all day, he spoke good English and there didn't seem to be a question he didn't have the answer to.Our day started at a traditional Berber house where we were shown how to make mint tea and made some delicious bread. We were then shown around the house to see how they lived before setting off into the mountains, stopping for some photos on the way. We trekked up to a number of waterfalls, our guide being very accommodating despite our slow speed. Once back down we had a delicious lunch then headed back to Marrakech. I think we were estimated to arrive back around 16:30 but it was nearer 18:30 (which we were more than happy about).A thoroughly great day and would highly recommend to anyone visiting Marrakech."

Our group grew from 8 to 12 then ultimately 17, but Mustapha accommodated us. He sends an agent to collect you from your riad for the hour or so journey into the mountains. He was the only disappointment - very grumpy and spent most of the journey on his mobile. We chose option 3 from the website with a hike and lunch in the Berber village rooftop riad. The food was the best we had in Morocco. A 'Berber 4x4' (donkey) accompanied us on the hike to carry water and snacks that were also supplied. We had a wonderful time and the 2 English-speaking guides gave us some very interesting facts and insight into Berber life. We negotiated a reduction as we were a large group - 40 dirhams each. Mustapha has a riad in the village so next time we visit we'd plan to spend a few nights there and do some more adventurous trekking. Highly recommended."

Mustapha was a good point of contact, by e-mail and phone, and the booking and payment etc all went perfectly smoothly. We chose a mixed one day tout, with half a day camel riding and half a day walking in the mountains.We were met at our riad on the day of the trip, by our guide Hassan and his driver. The journey was comfortable and smooth, although Hassan was not particularly talkative at this stage. We arrived at the camel ride and were given complimentary tea in a local caf\u00e9. Unfortunately, there was the obligatory tourist trap with one of the locals playing his instrument and dancing for us and then expecting money....... Also the toilet here was the worst I have ever used in my life, and no water for handwashing :-(The camel ride was fun, although did feel slightly vulgar - as a (comparatively) rich tourist passing through small modest villages and looking around, I did wonder whether the locals actually despised us for that, and it made me slightly uncomfortable. Hassan took some fantastic photos of us and was also much more chatty. He is only young, but fascinating to talk to, with a good philosophy on life and some interesting views. He is a well qualified guide, having studied for several years to become one, and he is totally against exploitation of tourists (unlike almost everyone else in Marrakech). Lunch was lovely and filling - in a small riad up a rather steep path - and afterwards, I just felt like going to sleep, rather than doing a hike in the mountains! Hassan is fit and nimble, but he was very understanding when I was struggling with the walking, as I am fairly unfit and it was also a hot day. So he cut the walk down to a more suitable length and pace, and made sure we enjoyed ourselves. The whole day was slickly organised and professional, and I would recommend to all."

We opted for the Ourika day trip and were collected by the driver at 9am at our Riad - the weather was not great and the driver spoke only French. I was a little confused as I had ordered an English speaking guide as only one of us spoke French. At one point I was tempted to cancel the trip as the weather worsened and I was concerned about communication. However, en route we picked up the excellent Mohammed, our English speaking guide. He offered us the option of rearranging the trip because of the weather but assured us we would have a good time nonetheless. He was right! Mohammed is himself a Berber and provided us with a wealth of information on the Berber people and their culture. We visited a Berber home for bread, honey and, of course, mint tea and then continued up into the mountains. The weather cleared and we had a fantastic day including a delicious simple lunch overlooking the river in a Berber village and a walk into the mountains - which was as breathtaking as it was informative thanks to Mohammed. I would thoroughly recommend a day out with this company and will certainly be doing another tour with them when I next visit Marrakesh."

We got some amazing photos. Next we headed to the mountains, stopping to take lots of photos and also enjoyed a walk where Mustapha pointed out several things of interest. We went on to eat at one of the Berber villages and had a fabulous tagine and bread made for us. Nothing was too much trouble and on the way back, we stopped to see Argan Oil being made at a co-operative. You may be able to book a tour once you arrive, at a cheaper cost (we paid \u00a355 per person), however, I was more than happy with the tour, the content, and the knowledgeable guide and felt it was well worth the money and I would pay it again, and use this company."

Our guide (also called Mustapha) and driver (Brahim) were very friendly and knowledgeable and delivered a great tour. They knew the quieter areas to stop to get the best pictures and discouraged us from some of the tourist activities that they felt were just for profit and did not help the local people. The only downside of the trip was that we both became carsick due to the windy roads (despite not normally suffering from this). We recommend to take a sickness tablet just in case!Lunch was included on the trip which was delicious and we had a full day of the tour from 8am to 8pm. We would highly recommend this.We were then disappointed that the taxi to the airport did not show up. We spoke to Mustapha who said it was on its way but after 25 minutes we decided to give up and get in a cab on the street. Having spoken to Mustapha since we are trying to organise a refund.

We had good guides, suitable accommodation (although quite basic in Oukaimeden we stayed in a fantastic riad in Imlil) and a good food. A particular highlight was coming down the mountain to find a lunch of tagines, kebabs, tea, bread and tangerines at the bottom with an incredible view down the valley. All the stops were pulled out to make sure we had a fantastic trip. Things were done the 'Moroccan way' which means everything gets done but not necessarily when/what you expected.

Mustapha was professional, knowledgeable and genuine. You can tell he's really passionate about his job plus he speaks fluent english. He arrived 30 minutes early with the driver, Rashid, and waited patiently while we had our breakfast at our Riad in Marrakech. They picked us up with a 4x4, which was driven really well by Rashid. You'll definitely feel safe. At the beginning of the journey, he told us about the history of Morocco and the Berber people. It was very comprehensive as both Mustapha and Rashid are Berber themselves. On the way to the valley, we stopped at the Argan oil cooperative and had the chance to witness the process of producing argan oil. After, we did a 2 hour hike through the Amizmiz valleys and Mustapha showed us how the Berber live their lives. The views were spectacular and the hike would be suitable for beginners. Just bring good hiking shoes as it can get slippery. Mustapha really took his time to show us all the different plants and fruits that grow there. We couldn't stop taking pictures and he was taking loads for us too. We then visited a Berber family at their village and had a very delicious home-cooked tagine lunch. We met their adorable children, too. We would recommend for you to bring some presents for the children. Our last stop was the dam and the views were amazing. We even got to dip our feet into the water. We highly recommend the Atlas and Sahara tour, especially Mustapha and Rashid. We'd definitely book a tour with them again."

            "review": "Fantastic Day in the Atlas Mountains. From the very first inquiry e-mail to the end of our day with this operation, the experience was top notch! My wife wanted to ride a camel while in Morocco, what we got was so much more. This day was one of the highlights of our trip to Marrakech. Mustapha promptly returned e-mails and organized our pick-up from our hotel in Marrakech. Our driver, Rachid, was friendly and knowledgable and gave us great insight to the many towns and villages we passed as we wound our way up the Asni valley.We met Mustapha and our guide Lahcen at Dar Amalou and took in the sights of the valley and Mount Toubkal over some mint tea. We then ascended a hill to Lahcen's home village of Aremd. As flatlanders from Florida, Lahcen recognized our difficulty with the altitude and tailored the pace perfectly with informative stops and photo opportunities. We wound our way through this delightful Berber village and back down the valley with few other tourists in sight all day. For lunch we returned to the roof of Dar Amalou and dined on a delightful tagine, couscous and salad while sitting on a bed of Berber rugs. The view from this private and quiet spot is breathtaking and you are left alone to enjoy your meal and recap the day so far.Afterwards we made our way down the valley to Imlil for our camel ride. I was expecting a 1/2 hour ride, similar to what one might get close to Marrakech. To my delight, we spent over two hours trekking down the valley through villages and orchards, the almond trees in full flower. Again, Lachen accompanied us to answer any questions during our ride. Rachid met us on the other end of our trek and delivered us to our hotel.If you are considering this operation for any of their tours, do not hesitate, book it and have an incredible experience! Thank you Mustapha, Rachid, and Lahcen."

We were collected from our hotel by an English-speaking driver, and met our guide on the way to Imlil. Mohammed spoke excellent English and gave us a fascinating insight into the history and life of the Berber people. His passion for the people and the country were quite inspiring. We had opted for a walking trip from Imlil, but stopped and had our photos taken on camels en route. We walked through the villages and had the most delicious lunch on the terrace of a house in Imlil as the Riad is being upgraded at present. In all we walked for about 3 hours, but it was not too demanding, and maybe we'll return to walk up the mountain sometime. Highly recommended!"

I thought I may have left it too late to organise a day in the mountains but Mustapha came back to me immediately with a range of different options. On the day, we were collected from our Riad and driven to the mountains collecting our guide, Mohammed, en route. The day was awesome and Mohammed really was amazing. Really easy going and knowledgable. Told us all about the area and traditions. Helped me up the snowy and icy patches of the walk, took loads of great photos, just great! Lovely lunch and then off for some camel riding. My only comment would be that the camel ride felt a little tacked on at the end as you basically ride around a field on your way home but we enjoyed it and all in all had a great day for what I felt was a reasonable price. I would definitely recommend this company and Mohammed as a guide. Fab!!"

We were referred to Atlas and Sahara Day Tours by a colleague of my partner's, and these kinds of personal recommendation always carry a lot of weight. We could immediately see why he had liked the company, as Mustapha responded to our e-mail with a variety of options very quickly. We had something specific in mind, and Mustapha was happy to tailor our day for us. We visited the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Ksar of Ait-Ben-Haddou and did a couple of hours' trekking nearby. Mohamed and our driver took such great care of us, and were really sweet and helpful when I got travel sick along the way. Mohamed is very knowledgeable on Moroccan history and culture, so we learned a fair bit during the day as well. They even gave us a gift of Moroccan coffee powder, with spices mixed into it, when we were bidding our farewells at the end of the day. All in all, a very positive experience!"

Both speak excellent English! We want to the Market which was interesting and although not a touristic one gave us a good insight into the farmers market (Ourika). Then went to Argan Oil Womens cooperative where you could see oil being made and there was no agressive selling. Next Lunch at Kasbah Tamadot was a dream - so beautiful and fabulous food! Then Imlil vallet and Mint Tea at Mustapha's hotel. Beautiful scenery; stops for pictures and amazing to be hot on the ground whilst there was snow on mountains! Very good value for money! Only downside the minivan was a little noisy!"

It was great having him guide us through the medina and the museums.The day trip was also absolutely wonderful. We had a camel trek in the morning through the valley. The views of the landscape were amazing and the children really enjoyed themselves.We were then taken to a riad where there was a beautiful log fire and a delicious lunch awaiting us. We were taken to the terrace at the top of the riad from which there were amazing views of the atlas mountains. Mustapha then showed us some of the beautifully decorated rooms which we hope to stay in on our next visit.We then went for an afternoon walk through the berber village and had time to shop for some local pottery. Hassan our guide had excellent knowledge and history and was very polite and helpful.I would have no hesitation recommending this company. Made my trip to Marrakech very memorable."

We chose a day trek through the Ait Mizane valley and Ibrahim (our driver) and Mohammed (our guide) really looked after us. We were picked up on time from our riad in Marrakech and driven through local towns and villages to Imlil where we started our walk. Nicely bracing walk up to 2000 metres with great scenery throughout. The route itself was not too challenging, with the paths clearly well trodden by other and we really enjoyed it. The time flew by and after 3 hours we returned to Riad Jnane Imli. A cosy place for lunch, which was part of the package. The best food we ate in our week in Morocco, really tasty salads and tagines which topped off a great day for us before we were taken on a different route back to Marrakkech to take in some new scenery. Highly recommended."

Our guide was informative, helpful and extremely friendly, making the whole trip very enjoyable. We had great fun walking up to the waterfalls (despite my silly walking boots - would advise wearing sensible footwear!) and then, based on our first experience, we decided to use the business again for our airport transfers and for a trip to Essaouira.

Driver met us promptly outside our Riad and drove us to Asni, where we started our camel ride. Ride was enjoyable and we passed by many Berber villages. Our guide, Muhamad, was polite, spoke good English, and very knowledgable of the area. After a feast of a lunch at the rooftop of a Riad in Imlil, we proceeded with our afternoon trek up the Atlas Mountains. Trek was tailored to our pace- we asked lots of questions and stopped to take many photos. Would emphasize the latter as the views were absolutely spectacular! Berber villages nestled on hilltops, snow-capped Atlas Mountains kissing the clouds, casting shadows on the Imlil valley below. Would recommend Atlas and Sahara day tours to travelers looking to escape hustle and bustle of Marrakech. Price point steeper than other alternatives, but you are paying for hospitality, exclusivity, and scenic views of the Atlas Mountains."

We were picked up at our hotel and taken on a beautiful drive to meet our guide, Mohammad, who proved to be excellent in every way. We rode camels for a ways (not the most comfortable, but fun!) through a few villages and had plenty of chances to enjoy the great landscapes. Then it was time for lunch on the roof of a riad. Excellent tajines, amazing views. Then to the trek. The first 10 minutes seemed straight uphill, but afterward it was relatively easy going. Mohammad is from one of the villages we hiked through, and had many interesting stories about life there. We were really lucky in that, because of the Eid holiday, the Goat Man was out chasing children up and down the hills! And what do you know, on the drive out, there by the side of the road was the Goat Man himself. All in an incredible value, a great day away from the bustle of Marrakech, and some of the most incredible scenery I've seen. Highly, highly recommended."

The drive there gave me plenty of time to ask about the scenery and about the city and country and we had a couple of stops en route for mint tea, which I quickly grew to like. The trip up the mountains was breathtaking. A local guide brought me up and was more than happy to take and pose for photos at various stops along the way. This is a fairly serious bit of trekking, so take clothes to keep you warm but prepare for being hot too - it's a few hours of serious walking. I idiotically only took Nike Air Max trainers with me, but managed OK.After the trek I went to the Riad operated by Atlas and Sahara Day tours - it is beautiful. I will stay there one day. I met Mustapha and was served a beautiful lunch (they were very accommodating of my vegetarianism). The village and mountain range have to be seen to be believed - very picturesque and interesting. Having lunch on the rooftop of the Riad gave some amazing views. A real highlight of the trip.From the moment you book to the moment you're dropped off, you're looked after by the impressive team that Mustapha has assembled.

We did the two day Mount Toubkal summit. We were unprepared for the weather during early November. It had been snowing on and off for the previous week and we were unprepared for the ice and snow on the peak. We were a little worried when we first saw the snowy peak and surrounding storm clouds, but Rasheed our guide put our fears at ease. We would attempt to summit but not do anything dangerous, if the weather turned bad we would turn back. We got to the Riad Jnane Imlil, where Mustapha (who runs the agency) decked us out with proper boots to walk through the snow (we had normal high top boots), snow jackets and gloves. They told us what the plan was for the next two days, where and how far we would walk. Unfortunately the weather turned bad when we reached our lunch stop and had to turn back. We could see it snowing on the peaks and people who had tried to summit that day were coming back saying that the conditions were terrible up top and had to turn back. Mustapha was really flexible and gave us a few options that we could do instead of trying to summit Toubkal. In the end we decide to return back to the riad and do a day hiking tour through the Berber Villages in the valley next door the following day. The stay in the Riad Jnane Imlil, was luxurious with floor heating. The dinner and breakfast which was provided was delicious. Mustapha our muleteer was very friendly and cooked amazing meals on both days of the hike, he organised all the carrying of our gear on the mule. Rasheed our guide was also very good, spoke English very well, friendly and knowledgeable.This agency is very well organised, communicating with Mustapha was quick and easy. We felt very safe through out and the people very hospitable."

Punctual and friendly drivers from the hotel to the start of the tour. relaxed, friendly and unhurried. Fantastic food in fantastic scenery. We could not do our original tour to Mt Toukbal summit because the weather was too bad, but the alternative route around the lower valleys was still incredible and the night in the Berber accomodation was great."

            "review": "Amazing tour, wonderful guides, fabulous experience!. I can't say enough wonderful things about this experience! The people and places were lovely. I finished my day tour from Marrakech last week of the Asni Valley and Imlil, which consisted of a half day camel ride and half day hiking trip, as well as a visit to the berber villages. Our guide was Hassan, who was extremely kind and knowledgable, and our driver was Muhammad, who was very funny and easy going. They were an ideal combo to spend our day with and very pleasant from start to finish. We started with the mint tea in the berber village, followed by our camel trek through the valley and then the most amazing lunch at a private Riad in the mountains. It was easily the best meal and service I received during my week in Morocco. I also had the pleasure of meeting Mustapha at the Riad during lunch, who was so efficient and responsive in coordinating the tour before I arrived in Marrakech. He even offered to provide me with extra clothes/shoes as he was concerned I would be cold in the mountains, which was so very kind of him. After lunch we proceeded with our hike in the Atlast mountains where we saw so many amazing berber villages and the sweetest people I've ever met -- especially the children! We were met with smiling faces everywhere we went and it was clear Hassan had friendly relationships with many of the people we encountered. He gave us a detailed history on the people and places we were seeing and was very informative. He even stopped us to take photos in the best places and was quite the talented photographer! FOr those of you who like a good panorama shot, he is a pro -- and does it without you even asking. We found it quite amusing as we are 20-30 year girls who love photography. Muhammad and Hassan offered to stop at a copper mill for us to see how many of the moroccan lamps, etc. are made but we had to make it to an early dinner reservation so unfortunately we didn't have time to do so. While this tour was absolutely amazing, perhaps what I was most impressed with was what happened after we were dropped off in the square in Marrakech (we had requested to be dropped there instead of at our Riad). Five minutes after we got out of the car, I realized I had left my brand new iPhone 6 in the SUV when they had dropped us off. I ran back to the hostel and immediately phoned Mustapha, who contacted Hassan and Muhammad. They checked the vehicle right away and confirmed it was indeed there, and brought it back and hand delivered it to my Riad. As most of you know -- this would never happen 99.9% of the time, even in New York City, where I live. They could have easily denied finding the phone and kept it for a profit but instead were honest and responded immediately. Hassan even made sure he only gave the phone to me when he came back to my Riad that evening. Overall, this company exceeded my expectations on every level and I would highly recommend them and this specific tour to anyone looking to do a day-trip or excursion within Morocco. It was wonderful and I will definitely be recommending them to anyone who travels there in the future! :)"

In both cases we were asked how long we wanted to take which was an excellent idea. Our taxi took us from our riad in Marrakesh to a riad in Imlil that we used as a base for the day. Upon arrival we were greeted by Omar and a nice glass of mint tea by the fire. Shortly afterwards our guide Mohammed , who was an absolute gentleman and a perfect guide, took us on a hike. We were given the choice of a 1 , 2 or 3 hour hike.We took a three hour hike through the valley which was absolutely gorgeous and set us up for our best meal of the trip on the roof terrasse of the riad. The view and the food were absolutely beautiful. After lunch we took a trip down the valley for a camel ride. Again the scenery was beautiful and a very enjoyable afternoon. The atlas hike was undoubtedly the highlight of our 4 days in Morocco and I would thoroughly recommend Atlas and Sahara Day tours."

I booked a short trip to Morocco as a surprise for my husband's 50th birthday and searched very many tour companies to find what I thought would be the perfect day trips for us. Because our time in Morocco was limited (we stayed in Marrakech) it was important to choose trips that did not include hours of driving. I decided on the 1/2 day trek in the Atlas Mountains (Asni Valley and Imlil) & 1/2 day camel ride, the evening Chez Ali dinner show and the Ourika Valley trips. Communication with Mustapha from the enquiry stage to the very end of our final day trip was outstanding, all emails and questions were answered promptly, the itinerary perfectly tailored, arrangements for pick ups from our Riad and drop offs excellent! We always knew the night before who our driver would be for the following day. The drivers spoke limited English but were extremely friendly and very helpful and tried hard to speak to us, as we did to them! The heavy rain previously had caused some roads to become tricky to negotiate but our drivers on each tour navigated them perfectly and we never once felt in any danger.Our guides for both Asni/Imlil and Ourika Valleys spoke very good English and were an absolute pleasure to be in the company of. Their knowledge of the local and surrounding area was impressive, they made the day trips enjoyable and unforgettable, by the end of each trip it truly felt as though you had made a new friend! The meals we stopped for which were included in the cost of the trips were tasty beyond belief, taken in perfect surroundings that looked like a picture postcard.Without a shadow of a doubt, Mustapha has given us the best tours we could ever have hoped for and I am immensely grateful to Atlas and Sahara Tours for that. The time we have spent with Hassan, Brahim and both Mohammed's has been amazing and has without doubt made my husbands birthday break memorable! Thank you Mustapha, we will definitely be back to Morocco, next time with the kids and will most definitely be booking with you! Please pass on our grateful thanks to Hassan for driving us to Asni/Imlil and to the camels, Mohammed for being a fantastic guide in the Atlas and for walking at my pace, and for staying by my side, reassuring me the whole time I was being hugely scared on the camel!!Thank you to Brahim for driving us to Chez Ali and staying there until it finished to drive us back to the Riad, and for driving us to the Ouirika Valley the day after. And to Mohammed for the unexpected stops at the Berber home and the artists gallery and the truly amazing walk, lunch (cooked by Brahim) and conversations we had!Not forgetting the gift of a jellaba and berber head scarf for my husband - he looked a treat, thank you!If you are looking for a tour company who can offer something different and at a very good price, do not look anywhere else!"

The mountains are stunning, the trekking was great - sometimes challenging, but very rewarding too. We were provided with a phenomenal lunch both days (fresh salad, tagine, cooked outdoors while we waited) and a superb dinner too in the beautiful little Berber village we stayed in. Best of all was our tour guide Mohammed, who as well as being interesting and helpful was just great company. It was clear his priority was our enjoyment and wellbeing, and teaching visitors about the Berber culture. I thoroughly recommend this trip - you won't regret it."

We booked a 4 day tour with Atlas & Sahara and although some of the days were quite long (due to distance of Sahara from Marrakech) we felt that we managed to see a good mix of what Morocco has to offer - with Kasbahs, culture, camel-trekking in the Sahara and a short day hike in the Atlas Mountains. From my initial inquiry Mustapha was attentive and helpful and everything ran like clockwork throughout our tour. Our 2 guides Hassan and Rachid were very friendly - with Hassan being very informative about all aspects of Morocco while Rachid was an excellent driver so we never felt any stress at any time, which I am sure we would have if we had tried to do all this on our own. We went to a few co-operatives but there was never any pressure to buy anything and it was interesting to see how things were made (eg argan oil, fossils, Rose Valley products). One of the best things on our tour was the Riad Jnane Imlil where we stayed in the Atlas Mountains - it was very comfortable and the staff were great. The food was a real highlight and they catered very well for us vegetarians. This is a family run company and almost all the staff and drivers seem to be related. Mustapha has a great understanding of sustainable tourism and seems to be doing a lot to help this particular area of the Atlas Mountains to look after its environment."

ALthough not one of the top tour desitnations, we chose this one because it included lunch with a Berber family. Mustapha did a very nice job setting up the tour and helping us to understand what was included. Unfortunately, that understanding did not extend all the way to our tour guide, Jamal. We were picked up by the driver, Lasim, at the hotel, right on time. We then had to drive to another city to pick up our tour guide. Lasim did a very nice job trying to tell us about different areas as he drove, but his English was very poor and our French was only a little better. When we arrived at the other city, we picke dup Jamal and drove from there to Azmiz. It was nice that on the way we stopped and saw a lake, but we were not sure what we were looking at and Jamal was not very forward with information. When we stopped for water, i knew we were int rouble because jamal wante dus to pay for water -- I had specifically asked Mustapha about this prior to the trip and he said the tour picked up the price for water. Jamal looked surprised, but still bought the water and we drove on. We then stopped outside of the town, in a very industrial and farming area and Jamal began to dismount and only then did he tell us we were going to hike three and a half hours to the lunch. This was not the tour I had paid for, Jamal was very flexible and offered different options, only one of which was the tour I had planned. When we finally got started, we walked one hour to the lunch, then two hours after -- that was what we had contracted for. When we got to the Berber house for lunch, I had assumed we would eat with them and learn more of their culture and their backgrounds. Instead, there were three women in the house, none of whom at with us. They served us some wonderful mint tea on the roof and mad a remarkable tagine of chicken and potatoes -- wonderful food. They were also very hospitable and very open to letting us see their home. But we did not really get to talk with them. Jamal did a good job as interpreter, but I just feel there was a lot more we could have learned about the valley and the lives of the people. After lunch we walked on and it was nice day and nice hike. The valley was absolutely beautiful and I am glad we did this activity. I would only ask that we get more information about the tour while on the tour."

Mustapha from Atlas&Sahara tours was great to do business with. He helped us decide on a hike that was challenging but that lasted just one day. Due to limited amount of time we could not do Toubkal but going up Assaoul was fantastic because we got to climb a bit with our hands. It was somewhat a challenging hike in that there were steep sections where it was difficult to get a foothold. Apparently this was due to rain, also not many people go up Assaoul since Toubkal is the main attraction, therefore in a way it was a unique hike. The logistics and schedule of the hike were extremely flexible they made sure to ask what we preferred; whether it was when to eat or where to get picked up if we were tired or wanted to continued. We had an amazing lunch at the Riad Jnane Imlil. The driver Brahim picked us up in our Riad in Marrakech on time and drove us to Imlil safely and back to Marrakech. We thought the price for the service was more than fair, 63 pounds per person. We really recommend the this tours because they are very concern and take care that the traveler is satisfied plus they do not stop in any souks (markets) they just concentrate in the hike."

We were picked up promptly from our Riad in Marrakech by our two really friendly guides, Hassan and Rashid for the long drive ( 7 and a half hours!) to the Sahara in a very comfortable 4x4. We had several stops on the way for sightseeing, plenty of photo opportunities, and a lovely lunch in the town where they filmed some of \"Gladiator\". We were met at the edge of the desert by Unis, our Berber guide and his camels.Once aboard, he whisked us off to our camp in the desert. A lovely meal awaited us and entertainment with the guides on the drums afterwards around the fire! Awoken at 6am for the sunrise breakfast, stunning views across the desert, and the ride back to our awaiting 4x4. Another long picturesque drive with plenty of stops again and lunch before reaching our charming Riad in the High Atlas mountains at Imlil. This is the nicest place we have stopped in Morocco. Wonderful rooftop views, plush room with underfloor heating, superb food and Mustafa and his team couldn't have made us more welcome. The next day Mohammed, our Mountain guide took us on an amazing trek through the mountains and villages, stopping for lunch at a Berber house. We had a fantastic three days. It was so well organised and everyone was so friendly and helpful. We can't recommend this tour enough! Thank you Mustapha!"

We were collected by our driver from our Riad in the Medina and transported safely to our first stop where we were greeted with by our guide Hassan with mint tea and a train of camels! Although the tour offers a 2 and a 1/2 hour trek on the camels most of us opted for a gentle (for the most part) 40 minute trek on the camels. That was the beauty of the day. There was no problem adapting the programme to suit what we wanted to do on the day. We were then brought to a local market that services over 100 of the villages from the mountains. Then off to the village of Imlil for a fabulous leisurely lunch with Mustapha and his team. We were treated to a delicious lunch of salads and bread, scrumptious beef tagines and fresh fruit and coffee. Another leisurely walk and a quick look in some of the craft shops in the village instead of going on a trek in the mountains we headed back to Marrakech and agreed that this day trip was one of the highlights of our trip. Well done to Mustapha and his team!"

Mustapha the owner was very helpful and quick to respond to emails, our driver who collected us from Marrakech and drove us to the mountains was very nice, and Muhammed our guide was simply amazing. The scenery was breathtaking, and we learned a lot about Berber life from Muhammed and by being surrounded by it as we passed through villages. It was nice to get away from the chaos of Marrakech as well. It is important to know that although this is advertised as an easy hike, it is not. It is more like moderate to strenuous. Both myself and my friend are in our 30s, experienced hikers and fit, and we both felt this hike was somewhat difficult (but absolutely worth it). What makes it difficult is the constant ascending and descending mountains with little flat ground, as well as some loose slippery rocks in parts. So although I thoroughly recommend this hike, make sure you have some decent fitness and your knees are in good condition. Thank you Mustapha and Muhammed for such a wonderful experience. It has been the highlight of our two-week Morocco vacation."

Our driver was hugely informative and helpful. It was a traditional Moroccan breakfast and the tour guides could not have been more accomodating. Then we went to the stables and were introduced to our horses who were immaculately cared for. Everyone was really friendly and welcoming. There were only 2 of us on the tour (one novice and one experienced rider) and we were accompanied by a guide on his horse and another guide on foot. The ride was very relaxed and we could set the pace, going for gallops if we wanted or just plodding along. Galloping in the Atlas mountains where no car can go and which is almost completely deserted is probably one of the most amazing things someone can do.We stayed overnight in a traditional house with the guides and a cook who travelled there on his friendly donkey. The accomodation is basic but worth it. It's better to take your own sleeping bag. There, we had a huge dinner with a massive tagine that was cooked on site. It was lovely.The house is in a small village so you see the locals and see a way of life that is so removed from your own. I still felt welcomed.We woke up and set off early the next morning after a nice breakfast and spent the rest of the day riding to the final destination. I couldn't recommend the experience more. I would love to go back. Coming from London this is a part of the world and a life you just won't see otherwise. The horses are very well looked after and great to ride. The staff couldn't have been more helpful and even the donkey was lovely! Couldn't have been better."

The setting plus the activities in nature provided the right antidote to the frenetic pace of the city. We booked our tour with Atlas and Sahara tours and everything from the planning process to the actual execution was professionally orchestrated. We opted for the 1/2 day camel trek in Asni valley & 1/2 day Hike in the Atlas Mountains tour.The vehicles were modern and air conditioned; the drivers showed up in a timely fashion; the transitions between the drivers to the tour guide and back were seamless and uncomplicated. Our tour guide Mahmood was pleasant, knowledgeable; he had great command of the English language and was very passionate about the Berber culture. Our luncheon on the top of the terrace was exquisite and the views gorgeous. The camels were very well attended and much better behaved compared to similar treks in other countries. As a matter of fact, the camel trek was the easier of the two activities. I would classify the level of the hike as \u201cactive\u201d and would advise to wearing comfortable shoes. But the payoff of this activity, reaching the waterfalls, was one of the greatest compensations in the trip.No matter what season you visit Marrakech, do yourself a favor, plan an escapade to the Atlas Mountains and book with Atlas and Sahara tours. The prices were reasonable, the lines of communication were always open and their service level was comparable to western standards with unique Moroccan flavors."

No question was too much trouble and was always answered with such knowledge , our trek by camel was nearly 2 hrs where we said our goodbyes to our lovely camels and Abdul our driver was waiting for us ready for the short drive up into the Atlas mountains to the Riad where we would be taking lunch and what a lunch it was 3 course of delight with mint tea we were left to eating with each other and the mountains and we were then ready for our trek into the Atlas with Mohammed . We chose a 2 hr Trek which was simply breathtaking , again with great guidance and knowledge and Mohammed was brilliant friendly and lovely could have accept for a nicer person to lead us. At the end of our trek through the mountains , stopping of a various points including the berber houses and waterfall and the little villages and mosques , it was back down where our car awaited to whisk us back to our hotel. If your visit Marrakech and can spare a day to explore the real Morocco this is definitely the trip and tour company to use !! Can't recommend them enough!!"

From the moment we were picked up to being dropped off at the end of the day we couldn't have asked for more. Both our driver and guide were incredibly friendly and knowledgeable. We started with a two hour camel ride which was great fun and a beautiful way to see some of the country. Mohammed, our guide, took pictures on my camera for the whole of the journey which are wonderful and a great memory of our trip. We were then taken for lunch at Riad Jnane Imlil and were served a lovely meal - the tagine was definitely the best we had tried. The terrace that we had our meal on was lovely and peaceful with incredible views. It was also lovely to meet Mustapha who I had been in contact with when booking this trip. We were then taken on a three hour hike in the Atlas Mountains which was definitely the highlight of the day. Mohammed was incredibly fun (he even performed an Eminem rap for us!) and interesting to talk to. It was wonderful to hear all about the Berber culture and how they live. We were able to paddle in a waterfall as well as having tea in a typical Berber home. It was a day that we didn't want to end. I can highly recommend this day trip and Atlas and Sahara Day Tours. I will definitely be using them again in the future."

We made a last minute booking (day before the tour) and they were quick and professional and happy to accommodate us. We were picked up promptly from the hotel in a comfortable 4 wheel drive and our driver was very polite. Once in the Atlas mountains we were taken for a wonderful 3 hour hike with Mohammed who is a local from the village - we very much enjoyed our walk with him and our talks with him. He had a good sense of humour and very well read. Our lunch in Mustapha's place was excellent - we sat on a lovely terrace and were given a very generous amount of food. I had a tagine every day in Marrakech and I enjoyed this one the most. Our afternoon camel ride was also an interesting experience and allowed you to see the country from different perspective. All in all it was a memorable day. The tour was well worth the price - just remember to bring a bit extra for tips as everyone who helped out that day definitely deserves it!"

From the beginning the lines of communication are kept clear by Mustapha and he was more than patient with us, so we were already comfortable going into the excursion. We were picked up from our riad in Marrakech by tour guide Hassan and driver by Mohammed. Both nice men, who we trusted and felt safe with from beginning to end. We did our 3 day excursion during Ramadan and immense heat, so it was a wonder just how much these guys went out of there way to accommodate us. As soon as we begun the excursion the days itinerary was explained and checked with us. We were taken to beautiful photo hotspots, and encouraged to have a look despite the long car journey ahead.Staying in the camp in the middle of the desert after a bumpy, but unforgettable, camel ride was just surreal. It's a beautiful and slightly luxurious experience and being able to meet other people of different nationalities there just made it that more special. We were watered and routinely fed, so the money paid is very worth it and the views !! Staying in the Atlas mountains of Imlil town is just a heart stopping must. The riad Imlil is a gorgeous boutique stay with the most stunning views of the valley and surrounding town. The food is superb, especially since we thought we'd had our fill of tagine - this was cooked to perfection. The staff are lovely - we felt at home and it wasn't long until i'd lost my brother to the staff and other guests, watching the World Cup semis. We met the infamous Mustapha - is this the nicest man in Morocco?! What a happy, welcoming man. He seemed genuinely concerned by our stay and trip.Our final excursion during the mountain hike was blissful and exciting. Hassan, for obvious reasons, couldn't exert too much of himself but he was wonderful in taking us all the way up and down a 2-hour mountain hike with time allowed for us to have fun in the waterfall and relax in the nearby cafe. I can't thank the team behind Atlas and Sahara tours enough for their attentiveness and welcome. Worth every penny and I'd do it all again.One small thing: if you want the full experience as is promised on the site itinerary - then don't book during the holy fast! Understandably you will have to make allowances otherwise."

It was absolutely one of the best experiences I've ever had traveling. Mustapha is easy to communicate with and very kind and hospitable; I booked the whole thing via email and he's wonderful in person. The night we spent in the mountains was at his riad, which at the time, had opened just a few months prior, and it was so beautiful. The Riad is extremely comfortable and feels like home and the view on the roof cannot be beat. All of our meals were served on the roof with a perfect view of mountains and stars. Our guide, Abdullah and our driver Mohammed were FANTASTIC!!! Mohammed drove so well on the curvy mountain roads that I did not get car sick once; and I have gotten car sick while driving in the mountains in India. Abdullah was an amazing guide, he was informative and fun to hang out with for the 3 days that we spent with him. He took us on a hike through the Atlas mountains that was unforgettable. He made us feel very safe and comfortable and we had a great time talking to him. This tour company works with another company to do the overnight stay in the desert and that was also wonderful. The camp at the desert was really comfortable with showers and toilets and the staff was very kind and so much fun. This is an amazing tour: well organized, comfortable and beautiful accommodations, knowledgeable staff and guides, delicious food, a one of a kind experience and the best way to see how diverse and spectacular the country is. It is well worth the price and you will not regret booking with them!"

He was very flexible in changing our itinerary midway during the tour. We wanted to stay two extra nights in Imlil instead of Marakech - which he arranged without charge! He's also a genuinely really nice person as is his family.2) We were met at the airport and taken to our place in Marrakech (I would really advise people not to hire a car as not sure if I could have driven on the roads!). We were a bit nervous when we first arrived but the accommodation was great and we were met by Mustapha who was very reassuring. Marakech was crazy but also amazing - I think 1 day was enough for me and kids - visiting the markets and other sights. 3) Our private bus was spacious, comfortable and air conditioned and gave great views. Our driver Mohammed was also really friendly and helpful.4) Our guide Hassan was helpful because it meant that we never got hassled and knew where to go. 5) The sahara desert and camel ride was the highlight of the tour. It was a two hour ride over sand dunes to get to the camp which is the perfect amount of time. I would have preferred to miss out on visiting the gorge in the morning (as it was a bit of a detour) and spent more time at the camp - as there was a great climb to the top of a huge dune by the side of the camp but we didn't have enough time to get to the top of it before sunset. The stay at the camp was fabulous - with music played by the camel guides. I got to learn how to play the drums.6) The riad we stayed at by the Gorges enroute to Sahara was fabulous. The food and the accommodation was really authentic, location perfect and the families really friendly. We went for a great walk in the evening from the riad.7) A\u00eft Benhaddou where they filmed Mummy and Gladiator was a great place to see Kasbahs. It wasn't packed with tourists so you got a real sense of the authenticity of the place;8) The Atlas Mountains were beautiful - and the Riad we stayed at in Imlil was perfect - very relaxing after the long drive.9) The guided treks around Imlil with mules were also amazing. We loved having lunch cooked for us on the mountains. We went so high we could eat the snow!Cons - very few:1) Travelling by road was the only way to get to the Sahara - however it meant that we spent a long time in our private bus getting there so not sure if suitable for really young children. However, the desert was spectacular and there was no other way of getting there - perhaps one day they'll fix the potholes!2) I never knew how much to tip guides as tipping is way of life in Morocco - it always made me feel a bit awkward. I would prefer it if the price of the tour was increased and they said that no tipping was expected. Tricky one!Thanks Mustapha for a great holiday - my boys will always treasure the experience!"

Our family of four spent a week in Morocco -- 3 nights in Marrakech, 2 nights in Agadir, and 2 nights on a private tour with this company. There are many companies that can organize tours, but Mustapha's prompt and professional correspondence made Atlas and Sahara Day Tours a stand out from the start! Our first night was spent at a nomadic camp in the Sahara Desert outside of Zagora. True, the quintessential dunes of Merzouga would have been a more ideal choice, but we chose to camp closer due to the very long drives each day (especially since we had kids in the car). There was plenty of sand prior to and around the camp, so we were not disappointed. The camel ride, meals, tents, entertainment, and guides at the desert camp were great!! The next day was spent driving into the Atlas Mountains with several stops along the way. Mustapha's riad -- Jnane Imlil -- is stunning and the meals were incredible!! Hassan, our guide, was knowledgable and helpful, always answering the myriad of questions we asked. On our final day, he took us on a hike around Imlil and to the waterfalls -- just beautiful! Although the driving time in the Land Cruiser was long, our kind driver Mohammed did a perfect job and we were as comfortable as possible. Mustapha even made it a point to come to the riad and meet us -- we were very impressed with him and his entire staff! Overall: fantastic experience from start to finish!!"

We were collected from our Riad by a driver and taken to the Riad Juane to start our trek. Our guide, Rasheed, a local Berber was an excellent guide and so much fun! We trekked up the mountain whilst speaking to our guide about local life. We asked half way to see a mountain and our guide took us on a detour through the some rough track to see a local (and not so touristy) waterfall which was lovely! After lunch we did another walk up the mountain to see some more local villages which were humbling. Locals inviting you in for tea is testament to the nature of the friendless we experienced.The day went perfectly and the trip was the best part of our 4 day trip."

He knew the best places to stay and when we asked for \"interesting hotels and places to stay\", he found them. He even took us to his family's typical Berber house for lunch one day, a high point. We observed other driver guides on our week long sojourn and we are convinced we had the best guide in Morocco. We also covered an amazing lot of ground because Moha knew all sorts of places to show us, off the track. He is a good driver, with a good 4 wheel drive car, always clean and supplied with water. We learlned more about the culture than we expected, and we enjoyed every minute of our adventure, Moha seems to know everyone and can allways get a table in the shade for lunch, and a bottle of wine if you want one.

Mustapha very promptly responded to all of our emails, and was very patient in working with us as we changed dates and wavered on having a private versus group tour. We finally decided to book a private tour for the two of us as having a third person join would not have saved costs considerably. Our scepticism about booking tours online were dashed away as soon as we started our tour and met our driver, Mustafa (not the owner) and our tour guide, Muhammed. Although the roads were quite winding, we did feel safe with our driver and Muhammed was very friendly and made the effort to explain any sights along the way. The camel ride was approximately 2 hours, winding through a few villages and roads, and it was definitely a lot of fun. Next, we had lunch at Mustapha\u2019s beautiful riad. This was hands down the best meal that we had during our 5 day stay in Morroco. We had more than enough food served to us, and everything tasted so fresh as it was grown in the gardens. This coupled with the views from the terrace made for a very memorable lunch. We then went on for a hike through Imlil Valley. The views through the walk were breath-taking and we learned a lot about the local culture from Muhammed. His love of the valley and the mountains was evident. All in all, we can\u2019t highlight enough how wonderful a time we had. Muhammed went well above and beyond, and tailored the day for us, as he helped my other half arrange a very special proposal! We couldn\u2019t have had a better person to share the moment with us.

His English was excellent and he had no problem in organising our vegetarian requests. We discussed which of the itineraries on his website we were interested in and our preference for a 3-4 hour hike rather than mules, camels etc.The whole day went incredibly smoothly. We (my friend and I) were picked up on time (9 a.m.) in a lovely Mercedes jeep type thing (not a car person!) and driven into the mountains, stopping at a co-operative run by women selling argan oil. This was a brief stop and no pressure to buy. There was also the chance to use toilets. The journey was beautiful and our driver very good. When we reached the village we met our guide, Mohammed, who was assigned to just the two of us. I cannot praise him highly enough. We did find the first half of the walk extremely steep and hard going, although undoubtedly beautiful. Although we both walk, it is not usually in 30 degree heat, uphill at altitude - something we struggled with. However, because it was just us, we took plenty of breaks and did not feel worried about slowing down others. Mohammed was patience itself and also extremely informative about flora, fauna, the Berber way of life, Islam - whatever we asked him about! Once we made it to the plateau the walk was much easier and we picked up our pace a bit as we stopped going uphill!lunch (all included) on the roof terrace of the riad owned by Mustafa and his family, was delightful: lovely salads, vegetable tagine and bread and melon and cherries from the garden. Again, very nice toilets!All in all, a fabulous day out, full of wonderful memories that we will treasure. Yes it was hard work at times, but totally worth it and I have no hesitation in recommending them as every aspect was so well organised and the people were so lovely. Very reasonably priced. Enjoy!"

Joining up with several French tourists early one morning near the Hotel de Marrakech, we were seated next to the guide, Ahmed, in the lead vehicle (6 Land Cruisers),so that he translate his commentary separately to my wife and me. After a fast run along the highway, we swung off-road and swayed and bumped our way to a viewpoint overlooking an ancient casbah, citadel or fortress. After taking the obligatory photos, we were soon surrounded by local boys, who took a great interest in my wife's artistic sketches, as well as helping their selves to one or two of her crayons. Shortly afterwards, we were loaded back into the vehicles and set off again, stopping every so often to look at points of interest. At lunchtime we were invited to dine, Moorish style in a Berber village, and after some shuffling around of seating, we eventually sat down to an excellent tagine or tajine cooked chicken and vegetable dish, with freshly baked breads, and salads all washed down with their ubiquitous mint tea. Later we set off a climbed steeply upwards, glad of the surefootedness of our 4X4s as the ground fell away sharply on each side, until arriving at another Berber village. This was to be our last formal stop before arriving onto the Kik plateau, our destination for the day. Our party were invited to enter one of the spacious Berber family homes to drink more mint and eat some small, very sweet cakes made with their superb honey. I eschewed this visit preferring to walk around the village which clung to the precipitous hills, offering staggering views over the plains below. I was soon surrounded by half a dozen childen all asking for stilos (biros), bob-bons or l'argent (money). We had been expressly advised not to offer money, but I soon exhausted my remaining stock of pens. Finally, I sat down at one of the viewing points and took in the views, making sure that I was in full view of the local villagers who were toiling away in back-breaking fields. In spite of the fact that they were speaking either French of their own Arabic Berber dialect, the children and myself managed to communicate in some way or other. They continued to ask for money, assuming I wished to take their photographs, but were completed nonplussed when I handed my camera to them instead. After overcoming their surprise, they set about learning how to use the camera and took it in turns to take some group photos, and they soon started to exaggerate their features, trying to outdo each other in outlandish gestures, falling around with laughter as they did so, when they viewed their results. After some 20 minutes, they politely and solemnly returned the camera to me, with \"merci, monsieur\" and I re-joined the main party as it set off to continue climbing into the lower hills of the Atlas. To all of our astonishment, we finally arrived onto the plateau proper to be greeted by the most beautiful shades of green, light and dark, with crops growing in abundance as far as the eye could see. This was the highest point we were able to reach in the time available, and we soon started our descent into the valleys below, before eventually arriving back onto the highway and returned to the hustle and bustle of the Red City of Marrakech. What did we learn on this special day. We had had a very good lunch, met some of the nicest people and children on the planet, had great fun and been staggered (truly) by the achingly beautiful lower Atlas mountains. All in all, a very good day was had by all."

We arrived at the Riad Jnane Imlil, where we met Mohammad our guide. We then had a lovely 2.5 hour walk - we could have made it as long or as short as we wanted, wandering up through a Berber village (great way to see village life up close and informally). Then we had what was probably our best tagine on our holiday - wonderful salad and bread too. We were supposed to go for another walk after lunch but were too full and tired from the morning so it was back to Marrakech for us. The views are amazing and the fresh air and vistas were definitely worth the drive. It was my husbands favourite day of the holiday. We paid 75 euros each and this included everything. I wore trainers but walking shoes and a pole would be ideal. This is not a stroll - it is a proper walk on uneven surfaces and requires some fitness. But just to give you some idea of the quality of this company, I left my shoes behind with the guide and they arranged for them to be delivered (1.5 hour drive!) to our Riad that evening - that is impressive service. Mustapha owns the Riad where we had lunch, and the driver and guide all live locally so its great to see some money going into these small villages. I thoroughly recommend this company. They couldn't have done anything better."

We were also really well fed and taken care of in the course of the ascent. Being amateurs in mountain climbing, we took 3 hrs more to complete the climb. Even then, Mustapha and his team received us warmly in Imlil without the slightest bit of frustration at our pace, but instead emphasized that safety was most important and gave us tea, biscuits and hot showers to ease our pain from the muscle ache and exhaustion. Also had a long pleasant chat with Mustapha on soccer. Overall, the Toubkal ascent with atlas and Sahara was beyond our expectations and we were glad we did it."

Since its a close distance from the Atlas mountains we thought we would get off our sunloungers and do something active. I looked at Tripadvisor for ideas and found Atlas and Sahara tours. Mustapha, the owner, very promptly answered all my questions by email and helped with choosing the right trip. We chose a day trip to the Asni Valley. We were picked up by a comfortable people carrier car and the 3 of us set off. En route we picked up our guide for the day who was Mohammed. More about him later. There was no waiting, all worked like clockwork. On arrival to Imlil, our starting point, we had some tea and set off for a walk up to 2000m observing small villages and life of the locals and scenery which was breathtaking. Snow at the top in distance and air so pure. Mohammed (bless him) looked after us- we are not the fittest people on the planet, he helped, waited, explained, supported. His love and regard for his environment and us as clients was exemplary. he is genuinely a nice human being who values his work. At the top he treated us to tea in a local dwelling and we got our breath back! The way down took us past a waterfall, so many photo opportunities. Finally we got back to Mustaphas house on the edge of Imlil village, where we were treated to a fantastic lunch on a roof terrace- tagine so tasty and salad, all so clean and beautifully prepared. Fruit desert followed. We got back to the hotel at about 1700. I left my jumper at the house in Imlil and Mustapha emailed me about it and next day delivered it to the hotel, eventhough I told him not to waste his time making the 1.5 hour journey. Overall amazing day, amazing memories and a company that they all should be proud of. Next time( after some serious fitness prep we want to go for the overnighter up in the hills. There will be a next time as we will never forget how lovely it was."

From my initial inquiries, through booking and to follow-up at the end of our trip. My husband and I had a fantastic time on this adventure and really enjoyed our overnight experience in the Sahara. The tour was very well organized and the guides were fantastic! Rashid was an amazing guide, he was very attentive to details and super nice! Mohammed was also great with the drive and we really trusted him and felt safe during the journey. The tour stops and restaurants along the journey were also very pleasant and everyone was very friendly. The overnight stay in the desert at the nomadic camp was a truly amazing experience and the tents with beds were very comfortable. Overall, we had an amazing time and we really appreciated the short trip away from Marrakech. I would definitely recommend this tour to anyone! Thank you again Mustapha, Rashid & Mohammed!!! We will remember this for our lifetime."

We booked a two night, three day tour of the Imlil valley through Mustapha, who was brilliant at helping us choose the right tour for us, go when we wanted and arrange dietry requirments and pickup and dropoff points. We assumed that we would be in a group with other tourists as we had not read at any point that it would be a private tour and so were blown away to find that it was just the two of us with our own Englsh speaking guide Mohamed, chef Lessan and mule to carry our things! Mohamed was so friendly and helpful throughout and Lessan made the best meals we had during our trip to Morocco on a camping stove on the side of a mountain (and loads of it!). The scenery was breath taking and weather perfect in March. Staying the the Berber house was a fun experience but we were really pleasantly surprised to find our second night's accomodation was in a beautiful Riad in the moutains, owned by Mustapha. Would highly recommend this trip to everyone!"

We spent three days on a truly unforgettable private tour in Sahara desert and Atlas mountains, which was a perfect combination of exciting experiences (riding camels, camping in the desert, stargazing) and breathtaking views (mountains, Ourika valley, Berber villages and many many more). We also went on a three-hour hike in the mountains - fairly challenging but much appreciated having eaten all those tajines!The experience wouldn't have been the same without the exceptional care and professionalism of all staff, during the booking and the tour itself. Rachid was our guide for the three days, and showed incredible patience in answering all our questions about the tour, Morrocan life and culture and more, and went above and beyond making sure we had everything we might have needed during the tour. Both Rachid and Mohammed (the driver) were genuinely nice people to be around.For the first night we stayed at a camp in the desert. While not fond of camping at all, I was relieved to find warm tents, showers with hot water, and bathrooms on site. We greatly enjoyed the meals cooked by the Berbers and the music played by the fire in the night.For the second night we were welcomed at Riad Jnane Imlil, which provides truly luxurious experience, with full range of amenities, mountain views (can be enjoyed from the roof terrace, private balcony, or even your own bed!). The most remarkable was the cooking by the chef Hassan - with plentiful three-course meals where the starter alone would be enough to feed you.Before the tour Mustapha, the owner, suggested we start with the desert night, followed by the mountains and hiking. We would recommend that as the driving time was out of the way and we could get back to Marrakech a bit earlier on the last day."

When booking this trip, Mustapha was great and prompt in his communications with us. Our driver Abdul picked us up from our Riad in Marrakech and drove us to meet our guide in Imlil. He took the time to tell us about the area, stopped at a scenic place so we could take pictures and had Berber music playing on the radio to get us in the mood! Our walking guide Mohammad was great. He kept up a good (reasonably slow and steady pace) for us to follow and he knew the area like the back of his hand. I kept thinking how hard it would have been for us to access the trails we were on if we hadn't been with him. When we reached the summit of our walk he pulled out fruit for us to snack on and both before and after our walk he brought us to get tea. I thought these were nice and unexpected touches. Lunch in the (beautiful) Riad in Imlil was huge and delicious. We were so full afterwards. On our drive home, Abdul kindly brought us to the train station in Marrakech and waited for us while we bought tickets for later in the week and then brought us back to our Riad. I would highly recommend a trip with Atlas and Sahara tours and I look forward to our next trip."

We then had a gorgeous lunch at Mustapha's Riad over looking the mountains. The food was absolutely delightful and the view was sensational. The camel ride was a great experience but the dried up river we went down resembled more of a dirt track which ruined the scenery slightly.But overall a great experience and a very well run company.

As has been mentioned in other reviews, Mustapha is extremely quick to answer queries and emails, and organisation was painless, with prices available in dirhams or Euros. The only problem we had with the day was that our excursion was put in the wrong page of their diary; we booked an early breakfast and were waiting for the driver, when no one arrived! Luckily, our riad manager raised them on the phone and they came as quickly as they could. Apologies were profuse and we didn't miss anything of our tour. We were picked up in a comfortable minivan, and the drive to Imlil was beautiful with plenty of opportunities to stop for photos, and a friendly driver. At Imlil, we met our guide Mohammad, who looked after us superbly. He made sure we had appropriate supplies, but brought along some extra water and fruit for us just in case. He was happy to adapt the difficulty and length of the trek based on our capability too. We trekked through some traditional Berber villages around Imlil, and Mohammad was extremely patient with our constant stops to take photographs of the views! He was friendly and knowledgable, but not intrusive; he was happy for us to walk and soak in the views without disturbing us, but also more than happy to talk at length about Berber history when we asked. We stopped for a break at a home in one of the higher villages, with time for some fruit and (naturally) mint tea while enjoying the views from a balcony. In the second half of our trek, we wound our way down the valley proper, following the river and seeing some beautiful waterfalls. Lunch was provided at Atlas and Sahara Tours' headquarters in Imlil. It was fantastic, with enormous portions, and very filling. We met Mustapha who was extremely apologetic about the earlier mix-up. Following lunch, we were driven further down through the mountains towards the river valley for our camel trek. Mohammad accompanied us to the camel trek as well, and acted as our personal photographer as we made our way along a dry riverbed! The camels were a fascinating experience even though neither of us were particularly good with heights....After just over an hour or so, we were met by our driver, said our goodbyes to Mohammad and the camels, and made our way back to Marrakech. We would highly recommend Atlas and Sahara Tours. Initial contact was excellent, and Mustapha was very patient in explaining numerous different tour options to us and letting us design a bespoke day if we wanted. Mohammad was perfect as a guide, and his photography was great; we were so glad he was there to capture our time on camelback for us!"

What an incredible day.Firstly, Mustapha has to be thanked profusely for letting me rearrange our planned excursion on the day (at the moment when our driver arrived at our Riad to collect us), due to me picking up a nasty bug from a restaurant the previous night. No extra charges, no hassle, which was fantastic considering how little notice I gave him.24 hours later, our driver arrived (again) to take us to our starting point, a roadside cafe in Reha, the absolute middle of nowhere, with nothing but 2 camels and a few horses around. After a pot of mint tea and some of our driver's breakfast which he very kindly shared with us (Moroccan style fried eggs, try then if you have time before your trek!) our guides for the day arrived.[A little word of warning about the roadside cafe: the \"toilet\" is a small cupboard upstairs with a hole in the floor. Nothing more. My advice - go before you leave.]We were helped onto our camels for the morning and set off. At the start of the journey you really need to place your trust in the camels. You'll be led over some very rocky terrain across a few streams to reach the paths that you'll spend the next few hours following - it's wobbly, but fret not, the grip that those animals have is astounding! The scenery along the way is stunning, totally other-worldly. Our guides were really friendly, answering any questions we had about the area. You will pass numerous Berber families in the mountains - give the children a wave, it looked as though we made their day. And contrary to popular belief, the camels were very well behaved, no spitting or kicking!We were picked up at the end of our trek (remember to tip the camel owner, 20dhms each is adequate) and driven to Riad Jnane, in Imlil, for lunch. It was getting a little cold outside, so the roaring fire which greeted us was welcomed. Once again, a pot of mint tea (this time with a plate of pastries) awaited us. Lunch was a massive salad to start, followed by beef tagine, then fruit. The dining room is really cosy, beautiful too. We were given a tour of the Riad by Mustapha (the whole thing has only recently been built, the guy is obviously really proud of his work!) before starting our tour of the Atlas mountains. Again, it feels as though you're on a different planet at times, it's unreal but stunning. It's not a particularly difficult walk, there is no climbing or anything treacherous involved. Watch for horses though, even on the narrowest passageways of the steepest slopes! Have your wits about you too, you will find yourself stopping at souvenir shops along the way where you'll be shown a selection of 'authentic Berber wares'. As with anywhere in Marrakech, don't feel pressured into buying anything that you don't want.The circular route took us back into Imlil, where we were picked up (the guide will stay, if you want to tip him (which you should), do so there). From there, we were driven back to our Riad.Pre-booking by email was really easy, everyone involved is extremely professional and friendly (and accommodating, as I discovered). Spending a day in the Atlas mountains is essential if you're coming to Marrakech for a few days. The best way to see them is by camel, and I would absolutely recommend booking to do so with these guys."

Mustapha always followed up promptly, answered all questions, and personally worked to make sure our expectations were exceeded.Our guide and driver were at the hotel 15 minutes early for the pick up. Both were friendly, well versed in the area we toured, outgoing, and made sure we had a good time. Answering countless questions about the geography, community, way of life, and stopping to take pictures, were never a problem. There were three adults in our party. The SUV, owned by the driver who is from one of the villages we visited, was only a month old. One of us set up from with the driver, two in the middle row, and the guide in the back of the SUV. We had plenty of space and a comfortable ride.Our guide was excellent at pacing the hike based on the speed we wanted to hike. The two and a half hour hike through fields and villages, along well marked trails, was not difficult. We stopped frequently to rest and take pictures.After the hike we had lunch on the roof top patio of Riad Jnane Imlil, which was part of our day tour. Construction on the riad was completed about two months ago after two and a half years of building by local crafts people. The attention to quality and detail was impressive. The view of the villages and mountains was outstanding. The food, home cooked, was one of the more tasty meals we had in Morocco....lentil soup, traditional tagine (one vegetarian by request) and fresh fruit. Traveling back to Marrakech we took a different route than the one used on our way out. This gave us an opportunity to see more of the beautiful country, interesting villages, and sites in the area.The day we spent touring with this firm was one of the best days of our two week Moroccan journey. Having experienced the quality of their service I wouldn't hesitate to book more extensive travel with them through Morocco."

After lunch we walked for two hours through small Berber settlements with great views of the valley and mountains.We organised the trip with Mustapha before we left England and he was very helpful, imformative and quick to respond to our queries. Our driver picked us up on time and our guide was confident and happy to answer any questions we had.Would certainly recommend Mustapha and his company for day treks or longer excursions."

            "review": "One of our best experiences in Morocco!. As a couple we booked a trip with Adil. It was one of our best experiences in Morocco. I must admit we travelled a month ago, so I'm a bit rusty on the details.The tour started with us visiting a local berber market. The experience was very different compared to Marrakech, and it's definitely worth experiencing this if you're able to. I'd like to mention that there was no pressure to buy anything, not here, nor at any other point of the tour. We had some \u201cMoroccan doughnuts\u201d and resumed our journey towards an Argan Oil cooperative.The Argan Oil cooperative allowed us to see and learn how argan oil is produced. It was solely run by divorced and widowed women. There's also a store with many argan oil products. These are legitimate, as we learnt that many other argan oils are mixed with inferior oils. With a brief pause we resumed our trip to the Ourika Valley.The Ourika Valley was a beautiful sight, and gave us the chance to appreciate Morocco's nature, something we hadn't been able to experience in Marrakech. Throughout the drive we had the chance to talk to some local children, and we had brought some gifts (clothes) to give. Seeing children being so happy with our gifts was a great plus.We had lunch with a berber family. We had tea, couscous, chicken tagine, and fruit (we were too full by then). The food was amazing, I'd even go as far as saying it was the best couscous tagine we've had in Morocco. Also we were served bottled water, which is nice!Afterwards we drove through the Asney valley. Again, this was nice to see, as it differed greatly from the Ourika Valley. After this great journey we were brought back to our journey.This tour is an amazing value for money. It's a great experience, and we felt very comfortable throughout the process. I'd recommend it to anyone!"

The booking process was easy and all the trips were carefully explained in an emails. We were met at our Riad by Abdellah who was our guide for the day. He was a fantastic guide who answered our many questions and looked after us for the day. The views were amazing and our 'hike' was amazing too, believe me, I'm not fit but I done it in my wedges! Lunch was in a great clean restaurant with good food, this was included in the price we paid which was 50 euros per person, well worth it. We stopped at a Berber house where they grind flour for a living which was interesting.Overall, a great day trip and Big credit to Abdellah who had to put with 5 women for the day!I would recommend this company to anyone who is interested in taking a day trip."

I travel a lot and have been on numerous tours - this by far had the best guides I have ever come across.Mustapha is excellent with communication - very quick and answers all of your questions / queries / comments insanely quick! The day our tour was booked for was forecast to rain so Mustapha gave me a call and asked if I'd like to change the tour to the following day as it was forecast to be sunny...after juggling a few bits around, I agreed and am so glad I did!Hasan arrived at our riad half an hour ahead of schedule but was happy to wait for us whilst we ate breakfast. He then walked us to the car where Ali was waiting to drive us to the Asni valley for our camel ride. Ali and Hasan were great hosts, answering all of our questions along the hour long drive to the camels and telling us facts and anecdotes about Marrakech that we did not previously know.Camels were great - not a hugely scenic route taken on the camel ride, quite different to the desert (you ride them through a river) but was ok. Then drove to the Imlil village - Hasan and Ali's hometown and was amazing! Covered with snow, up to our ankles but the sun was beating down on us heavily. We watched children ski, had a go ourselves, hiked to the guesthouse and had an amazing lunch prepared for us by Omar and his wife - tea, starters, main course AND dessert. I mentioned to Mustapha before that it was my friends birthday and Hasan's mum made the most beautiful, ornate cake - she could put Patisserie Valerie out of business! And this at no extra charge!!!!!! We also all requested boneless chicken when we booked our excursion and this was done too.On the way back to the riad we asked to stop off somewhere to buy authentic argan oil and were taken to a women's argan manufacturers, given a tour, bought our oil - AND given free gifts! Then when back in Marrakech Ali waited for us to gather our swimwear and dropped us off to the Hammam for our treatments.It's the little things that matter to me that make up such great products and companies and the Atlas and Sahara tours team are honestly fantastic - I cannot recommend them highly enough."

Abdil/Abdul was our guide for the camel ride and trek around Imlil and he was brilliant. So friendly, and so knowledgeable about his environment. The beef tagine for lunch on a roof terrace looking up at the snow-capped Atlas mountains was also lovely!Would highly recommend this company, and especially the 1/2 day camel ride and 1/2 day hike option!

He then drove us out of Marrakech and into the High Atlas to a village called Imlil where we met our walking gide Abdil.Abdil was a wonderful guide and after a mint tea we were off. The walk was very interesting and Abdil was very patient when we stopped to look at interesting rocks or photograph a view. He was also a fountain of knowledge about the Berber people and their customs. When we reached the highest point (about 2100m) Abdil suggested we have a rest and produced some wonderful oranges from his bag. We then followed Abdil along a ridge and then doan across a riverbed before returining to the village for a welcome lunch of the best Beef Tagine I have tasted.I thoroughly reccomend Atlas and Sahara tours trip to Imlil as a break from the city and souks - the air is so fresh and clean you can taste it.Gary"

            "review": "A Well Arranged Tour. The trip really began with our cold call to Mustapha and he was always quick to respond during the planning process. We were 2 familes, with children in the 7-12 year-old range. While we chose several of our own riads, Mustapha did a great job setting up guides, all of whom were wonderful, including the very knowledgeable and amicable Driss. Our driver, Mohamed, was excellent, and most important, very safe, as he carried 9 of us throughout Morocco. We really enjoyed our 2-day trek in the Atlas Mountains; I thoroughly recommend the excursion to all visitors, if possible. Leave the wonderful medinas for a couple of days as the mountains are a great escape/experience for children and adults alike. However, I would be specific with exactly how long and strenuous you would like the trek to be; our mules certainly helped of course, carrying children at times, not to mention yours truly. Overall, we arguably covered too much territory, visiting Marrakech, Essaouira, Atlas Mountains, Fes, Rabat, and Casablanca over 10 days. While Rabat may have its high points (love the seaside locale), it is probably better to spend more time in Fes. To conclude, I certainly endorse Atlas and Sahara, but one should give plenty of input (Mustapha will gladly offer many hotel options in each city) and ask for age appropriate (kids) activities if need be."

            "review": "Private 8 day Sahara/Atlas Mountains tour. We booked an all inclusive week long tour with Atlas and Sahara tours for the first week in January. Mustapha was very easy to deal with via emails and always responded promptly. We received quotes from three different companies and his was well within our budget and also included going to both the Sahara and the Atlas Mountains which appealed to us. The itinerary included sleeping overnight in a hut on the mountains but as we were concerned about what the weather would be like we rang Mustapha to change this and it was not a problem.Our tour included airport transfers, all our accommodation and all the meals except lunches and dinners in Marrakech. It was wonderful arriving in Marrakech and being met by our driver who took us to the riad where we met Mustapha. We went over the itinerary for the next week and then were free until the next morning when we would be collected at 8am. We were fortunate enough to have Hassan for our five day tour of the Sahara and the Atlas Mountains as well as a wonderful driver who got us to all our destinations safely and on time. The van was in excellent condition and was well cared for. The distances are very long and some of the roads are quite bumpy. Our 8 year old daughter had a bad bout of car sickness so it is a good idea to take travel sick pills.Both Hassan and our driver were very thoughtful and protective of our children and we felt very safe in their care. Our eldest daughter has Down syndrome and they were very protective and kind towards her and were always looking out for her. One instance of this was when we arrived at Merzouga to begin our camel trek but as it was getting cold and dark Hassan recommended that we go to the desert camp by 4wd. Even though we were a bit dissappointed it was the right thing to do as it got very cold and dark quickly and it meant we were able to get to the camp much more quickly and have dinner and get settled. I do recommend bringing sleeping bags if you are sleeping in the desert camp in winter though as we were quite cold! Once the kids were asleep we all sat around the fire and were entertained by singing and dancing - with Hassan playing one of the drums. We were informed though that it is not a concert but instead a cultural exchange so everyone had to share a song from their own country. We had a large group of Italians in the camp so they entertained us with some Italian songs and being New Zealanders we had to oblige by doing the Haka. We still got to do our camel trek though as the next day we woke to see the sun rise and then trekked for an hour and a half through the Sahara - definitely a highlight of the trip.We were aware that today we were travelling 580 km from the Sahara to the Atlas Mountains but we hadn't really realised that with the road conditions this would take 11 hours. It was a very long day and in hindsight we should have taken two days to get back. Normally the trip to the Sahara is done as a four day trip and we did it in 3 days in order to fit in the Atlas Mountains as well. There is a lot to see along the way as we went back a different way and it would have been good to not feel so rushed and to stop and enjoy the amazing scenery.The advantage of having such a long travelling day was that it meant we had two full days in the Atlas Mountains. Hassan stayed on as our tour guide in the mountains but the driver returned to Marrakech after dropping us in Imlil. The next day our daughter was still recovering from her car sickness so it was just myself and my other two children who went for a walk. Once again the company was able to adapt to our needs as we decided to do a shorter 3 hour walk instead of the 5 hour walk as planned. My husband decided to go for a mountain bike ride and Hassan organised all that for him which was great. Mustapha came out to the guest house that evening to check up on us and it was great to be able to feed back to him as to how the trip had been.The next day we were all back to full health and we went for a walk through the valley. We had a mule with us and the children took turns riding her. Hassan was a great guide and as he is from the Imlil area knows everyone and would stop for a handshake and a chat with people we met on the way. We had a fantastic lunch in a Berber house and were overwhelmed by their generosity as well as the amazing food. We returned to Marrakech that afternoon and said our farewells to Hassan. Our tour included a guided tour of Marrakech the next day and once again the guide was great.Our trip to Morocco was amazing and I thank the Atlas and Sahara team for their organisation of our wonderful holiday. All our accommodation, food, excursions, guides and transports were perfect."

We were collected from Jemaa al Fna square at 9am and after a luxury minibus journey we were in the valley ready to hike for about 10:30am. Hassan will ask what you would like to see and where you would like to walk so you can choose and plan your trip with his maps.Hassan and his family his immediate family are originally from Imlil village and so he took us on a familiar 3 hour hike up and around the mountains in the valley. Although it was winter so we could not appreciate it fully, it was still breathtaking to be 2000ft and looking up at the highest peak in the Atlas range covered in snow with bright blue skies and hot sun on our faces.Hassan knows all about the physical geography of the area and will point out and explain about rock types, formation and it's relation to the plants, animals and locals way of life. Also as he comes from Berber ancestry he can talk for hours about the history of Morocco, the tribes and rulers and all about the Berber culture.We met some Berber guides along the way who were generously handing out sweet mint tea to walkers, and in the cold mountain air it tastes like nectar!We stopped for lunch at a guest house in the village and his family prepared a wonderful traditional feast for us to enjoy on the patio with views across the valley. As the Berbers will give everything they have to guests even if they have nothing for themselves, this was a very heartfelt gesture and very much appreciated. Everyone in the village knows 'crazy Hassan' and you can tell from the locals you encounter that he is well loved by his family and friends.I would thoroughly recommend an excursion with Atlas & Sahara Tours as they are very good value for money and if you are fortunate to have Hassan as your guide, you will be in for a very interesting trip in excellent company. Its a welcome break from the hustle and bustle of Marrakech and would be a perfect trip in the spring or summer when the valley is green and full of flowers."

A few weeks ago I was reading other peoples rave reviews about Atlas and Sahara Tours Imlil - Ait Mizane Valley day trip and I am delighted to say they are all true! I agree that booking is easy, you are well looked after and safe. Mohammed picked us up at our hotel at 8.30 and we had a cheery chat on the way to Imlil stopping to take photos of the terrific views and also at an all female co-operative to watch them making argan oil products (no hard sell but an opportunity to buy if you wanted). You could also use the toilets there. We arrived at Imlil where Mustapha met us on the roof of the Cafe Atlas Toubkal to make sure we were linked up with the correct guide, Jamal (a law student and nice local guy).We settled payment over a cup of tea and biscuits. We accidentally overpaid and he gave us back the difference - an honest man! Another opportunity to use the toilet before heading off. The walk with Jamal was a pleasant hike through villages with some steep parts as we headed higher up the mountain. You'll see some of village life and pass a few people with working donkeys. If you have mobility or breathing problems this is not for you but I reckon it is manageable for most people. Ankles and knees take a bit of a pounding when going back down some of the rocky steps but with the right footwear the overall experience is very good indeed. Lunch was on comfy cushions at low tables on Omars rooftop including a very tasty salad, tagine and fresh fruit from the local trees. Plenty of mint tea and water and loads of bread on offer. Terrific views and a warm welcome - all done well. Another opportunity to go to the loo and then off again to complete the circuit before going on the camel ride. That was an enjoyable short trip through villages and flatter, less remarkable countryside. Jamal stayed with us and walked along with the camel handler. It was easy getting on and off and Aisha my camel was gentle and the ride was slow and steady with other opportunities to take pictures. The order of the day is dependent on weather and light so your trip may differ. Some people told us they did the camel ride first. Mohammed was then waiting at the other end to take us back to our hotel before 4.30. All-in-all a great day out, just us with our guide and driver and a set of fantastic pictures and great memories. Wear walking shoes or good trainers and layers as the temperature can vary with altitude but honestly it wasnt that cold in the late December sunshine. Enjoy yourselves and don't hesitate to book with this company if you want a safe, enjoyable day out."

Following Jacquelene the mule who carried our load up the slope, the young guide Hassan told of the local vegetation and his background. Later Ibrahim the jolly smiling french speaking cook prepared a warm meal with fresh vegetables and fruit. \"His nick name is the 'adjective'. He picked that up at school\" explained Hassan.We ate in the autumn afternoon sun by Juniper trees on the steep slope looking down the valley. A herd of goats gathered in a clearing before us. Ibrahim had a job as a cook in a hotel in the flatlands related Hassan. He left it because he was happier in the mountains. When not working with tourists he looks after his herd of goats.Following trails lined by small shrubs and trees over a pass, we entered the valley to view in the distance Tinzerte, a sizable village of dark brown clay buildings.Tiny winding earthen paths separate the houses. No machinery of any type can enter. We passed friendly lively snotty nosed dirty faced children, and shy teenagers. The smells and sounds of the farmyard everywhere. At the lodgings a welcome with tea made from herbs which included sage. Almost as much ritual was involved here making and dring it as with yerba mat\u00e9 tea from S America. There was little sign that any of the friendly villagers spoke european languages.The sizable accomadation had electricity, running water, a flush toilet and shower. Wooden shutters, sometimes with plastic sheeting, on the deep set windows seal the rooms from the wind. Little use seems to be made of glass. Ibrahim spoiled us again later with a terrific evening meal.Although the rooms had no heating there was no shortage of blankets. Lying wrapped in blankets we heard distant dogs barking till they too fell asleep. Sunrise calls from mosques tried to awaken us. After an 08:00 breakfast I set off with Hassan. Beyond the village we passed animal folds which protect the herds from nocternal wild swine, jackals, foxes and even recently leopards and ...formerly lions. Hassan explained the irrigation system of the steep valleys, its managment and organization, of the collection of oak leaf fodder and of the medicinal oleanders plants women gather and carry to the village. He gave me a detailed north african view of Marrocco's history.On more than one occasion we came across two or more of european women making the journey together with a guide.Climbing now Hassan and I made our way further up the valley along barely visible paths between the low Juniper trees. Ibrahim followed some kilometers behind with the mule. His Berber songs travelled loudly and clearly through the valley and were answered by Hassan. There was more water in the streams in the valley now. At a larger village children play and laugh on their way home from school.We stop at a small berber village on slope. Hassan points towards the sun which lights up a ridge on which lies the village Id Issa - our destination for the evening. We enter a house with wooden door that covered only part of the height of the entrance. Inside are earth walls and an uneven earthen floor. In a corner lie potatoes and maize. No shelves. Storage is in plastic sacks. A welcoming middle aged housewife and her fiendly asthmatic friend share some marrocan tea with us, as we sit on the window ledge in the hot evening sun. Soon we travel further up winding paths to 1800 m and our guest house. A US lady on an aid project for a year was staying also. The evening was cold outside but despite any further form of heating warm inside due to earthen construction of the building. The hot shower here could be really hot. Plenty of blankets welcome again tonight. In the common room a television goes on. Satellite reception. More channels than you can hope to watch. An interesting discussion followed on the history of North Africa, Europe and the New World. Then bedtime. For the cold night I put the space blanket between the sleeping bag and the blankets - it worked a treat. Again the sunrise calls from mosques were ignored. Breakfast of bread, jam, and la vaux qui rie cheese. Then the luggage goes on Jacquelene's back. Up the slopes with us and higher up the valley we reach a pass above 2400m. Two swiss ladies and their guide having rest there had a photo shoot of Jacqueline before they moved on up to the crest. From our high perch we could hear mosque loudspeakers in a village below broadcasting the sound of prayers from CD player reminding that civilisation was not too far away. For us it was now a steady descent down the valley in the warm autumn sun to Imlil village, and Marrakech to be broken only by a final fantastic lunch from Ibrahim."

Omar and his wife prepared us lunch and served us on their veranda. The food was amazing and he and his wife made a special vegetarian meal for me! I wasn't expecting it since I hadn't requested it, I had only mentioned to Mustapha through our emails what the eating preferences of the group were when he asked. He must have passed on the message that I was vegetarian to Omar and made me a special meal, it was so thoughtful and considerate of them. The food was absolutely supurb! After lunch we hiked through the mountains with Mohammed and had an overall perfect day. We were then driven back to our hotel in Marrakech by another man named Mustapha who was also very kind and sweet. Myself and my entire group highly recommend Atlas and Sahara Day Tours because they made us feel so welcome and we saw the most beautiful sights we could ever imagine! -Katherine"

Found it very easy to book with mustapha over email and ask any questions needed. The taxi transfer was prompt and the driver was not worked about us stopping to take photos all along the route. Interesting trip to the argan oil cooperative on the way as well. Once in imlil we met weigh our guide hassan and set off on our trek. The countryside is stunning for walking and hassan was full of facts and answered any questions we had. The lunch at the Berber house was very special. It was nice to taste traditional Moroccan food out of a restaurant and experience the hospitality of a better family. All in all a brilliant day which really added to our entire trip to Morocco"

We read the outstanding reviews for this company and I contacted Mustapha to arrange the excursion. Mustapha answered promptly and we arranged the outing to include a 1/2 day camel excursion and then hiking in the mountains. This outing was the highlight of our entire trip to Morocco. I highly recommend it. Mustapha responds quickly to emails and delivers everything he promises. We decided to add two more people we met on the train onto our trip and Mustapha was able to accommodate all of us at the last minute. The driver and guide picked us up from our Riad and the guide, Abdulla, was with us the entire day. We then drove in a jeep type vehicle to the mountains, switched to camels and traveled several hours by camel into the mountains. This trip takes you off the beaten path where you can see the beauty of the landscape. It was quite, peaceful, and very relaxing. We saw village women riding by on donkeys and working in the fields. Young children were going by on their way to school, and various other villagers were passing by either on foot or on donkey. We met Mustapha in a small village after the camel ride and paid him before we went hiking into the mountains. Lunch was remarkable. It was up in the mountains next to a deserted waterfall. The food was delicious and the surroundings were breathtaking. Abdulla, our guide, was a very polite, charming, and knowledgeable young man. I highly recommend requesting him. What you will need. Do wear either tennis shoes or hiking boots - don't even think of doing this excursion in sandals. You will be climbing up rocks. You may also need a light sweater depending on the time of year. Eat a big breakfast because by the time you eat lunch you will be quite hungry!Thank you Mustapha and Abdulla!Tami"

The store clerk had wound our new headgear tightly around our heads, indigo for me, sky blue for Josie. Minutes later we stood on the shoulder of a desert highway in the growing darkness.Two saddled camels and a grizzled Berber tribesman caught the last rays of the sun. Hassan, our guide from Atlas and Sahara Tours, resplendent in his agave silk jellaba and boony hat, hung our backpacks over the handlebars, and told us to climb onto the hulking recumbent beasts.As soon as we sat in the saddle, each steed lurched and jolted upright and we were off into the Sahara. A half moon lit up the sands, and cast perfect silhouettes of our caravan across the dunes.Josie had booked this custom private tour months before, and it was unfolding even better than we'd hoped. Hassan our guide had already taken us to the the red adobe city of Ait Bennadou, and Glaoui Kasbah. He gave us the history of these fabulous monuments and fielded any and all questions that we posed. The thrilling drive through the breathtaking Atlas Mountains by our expert driver (Abdul?) was like a trip through geological and cultural history.Adii, our camel driver, led the string deeper into the dunes before we arrived at camp, a dozen black, goat hair Berber tents.We were greeted with sweet mint tea and cookies. We reclined on colorful carpet covering banquettes. The clean toilets, sinks, and showers were in a large tent off to the side. Adii served a delicious chicken tagine, and we listened to drums and Berber singing far into the night. We retired to our goat hair tent, where we slept on twin beds. Rousted out of bed before dawn, we mounted the camels. The sun came up behind us, casting long shadows ahead of us across the dunes.The long and spectacular drive back across the Atlas mountains to Marrakech was yet to come, but Hassan knew the best rest stops, and we enjoyed mint tea at each stop. I can recommend Atlas and Sahara Tours for anyone that wants an adventurous dose of Morocco."

Everything was very well organised, from picking up from the hotel to return. The guide Hassan and muleteer/cook Abdul were excellent - Hassan explained along the way the geology, fauna/flora and also gave us a unique insight into everything Morrocan. The days were lengthy but the spectacular scenery and the fact that we were on our own apart from one other couple who we met up with in the evenings made this a trip to remember. Meal stops were a surprising treat - banquets laid before us - if anything could be criticised it was that there was too much food. This is a really great trip to do if you want to experience the Atlas, see village life and enjoy walking, and Atlas and Sahara organised it without a hitch - it is worth pointing out that the other couple we met in the evenings had gone through someone else, but their guide didn't speak any English and they had hidden extras - like having to buy water whenever they wanted it from the muleteer/guide. The only slight disappointment was the last day - walking primarily along a dirt road from Timichi to Setti Fadma as the route through the gorge had been closed due to rock falls. Also the route on day 2 varies from the publicised one in that we didn't cross into the Oukaimeden valley - though this did not spoil our trip in any way."

His knowledge and passion for the mountains was clear and almost infectious, he led us across the stunning High Atlas telling us about the area and its culture, he was the perfect guide! We then arrived for lunch at a beautiful guest house and enjoyed some of the best food we ate in Morocco, the family were welcoming and left us to indulge while taking in breathtaking views of the mountains. After lunch we then embarked on a camel ride, which was tough going for a couple of non riders, but Mohamed made us feel at ease and took plenty of photos of us perched on these incredible animals. More breathtaking views and a lot of laughs were had.Absolutely shattered but uplifted and elated from or day, Abdul returned us to or riad around 5pm. We couldn't recommend this more highly and it is an experience we will never forget."

We were met at the end of the drive by Hassan, a very friendly and helpful guide whom spoke very good English.

The camel ride was led by a man, with Hassan maintaining communication with us aswell as leaving us to marvel the views ourselves. Hassan very kindly, without asking, took plenty of photos of us on the camel and the surroundings as we rode. The driver then met us at the end of the ride and drove us further up the Mountains, accompanied by Hassan. When we arrived to our destination Hassan took us to a local residence for a delicious 3 course lunch and tea with an amazing view. We stayed for 90 minutes, again with our privacy while we ate. After lunch was the hike to which Hassan gave us two options (very thoughtful of him as this was after he discovered my partner was pregnant). We chose to trek through the villages as oppose to the more unpredictable terrain of the heights of the mountains. The trek lasted around 2 hours, Hassan continuing to offer two options as we progressed, he was very considerate to my partner being pregnant, which was just one of many complimentary aspects of Hassan.

The camel trek lasted a couple of hours in desert-like surroundings - my friend and I had a camel each with a baby camel following behind. We were led by Hassan, a friendly and very knowledgeable English speaking guide, and a man who guided the camels. It was great fun and both guides happily took lots of photos for us. Hassan then took us to the Saturday souk which was very busy with a real community spirit. We had a mint tea and tried some local honey.Our driver then took us to the Atlas Mountains where we had a delicious lunch of rice salad, chicken tagine and fruit in a guesthouse. We then opted for the slightly longer trek through the Imlil village rather than through the mountains, although we were glad we had brought our walking boots given the rough terrain. Hassan taught us a lot about the mountains and the Berber way of life, pointing out a Berber wedding as we passed and explaining how the water system served each Berber village. He showed us his house in the distance and invited us into his aunt's house for another mint tea. We arrived back at around 4.45pm and our driver took us back to Marrakech.All in all it was a brilliant experience and great value for money."

It was booked one day beforehand but there were no problems at all sorting it out for us and Mustapha emailed to confirm the booking within a few hours The day was really well organised. We were picked up from our hotel by Omar at 8.30am and driven to the base of the mountains. During the drive to the mountains Omar provided lots of interesting facts about the Atlast Mountains which kept us entertained. He also offered to stop for us to take photos as the scenery was breathtaking. Omar is also a very good driver because those roads were not easy to navigate but we felt safe with his driving.Omar left us at the base of the mountains with our tour guide Hassan who was with us for the rest of the day. Before we went the camel ride, we were given mint tea and Hassan packed away a few bottles of water for us as it was really hot that day.The camel ride was amazing. It was really quiet and peaceful along our route as we went up the mountains and around the valley and villages but 2 hours is just about enough as we were getting a bit tired towards the end. We were then picked up by Omar again and taken to Imlil where we had a traditional Moroccan lunch and rested for a while.This was followed by a 2 hour hike around Imlil where we saw the waterfall and the way the local Berber people live followed by tea in one of their houses. I thought it would be tiring but it was was perfect but I would suggest you wear good walking shoes.The scenery was amazing and our guide Hassan was really knowledgeable and kept answering all my questions whilst also telling us about the interesting history and culture of the region.We were three females but felt safe and were looked after really well for the whole of the day. I cannot wait to return to Marrakech to book some of the other tours as we only saw a fraction of the Mountains and I would love to see more.All in all an amazing day and thanks to everyone for making it a wonderful experience for us."

Very thoughtfully, a mule was provided for our son, who might otherwise have found it a hard walk in the heat. The scenery was superb. it was how I imagine Nepal to look.

From the moment I first emailed Mustapha, I was confident that we had selected a great company to travel with. All emails were promptly responded too and arrangements easily made. On the first morning, we were collected by Abdul (our driver), and Mustapha, and taken to meet our local guide Hassan who would stay with us for the duration of the trip. Abdul and Hassan immediately made us feel at ease, safe, and secure. We could have been more looked after. The trip was more than we could have hoped for from the description on the website. All food was included, and was far and above what I would have expected on a trip of this sort - we rarely completely finished a meal! The only thing to bear in mind is that you pay for all drinks except water. Hassan and Abdul kept us well stocked with 1.5L water each per day and more as and when necessary/if it got warm .Highlight of the trip was definitely the moonlight camel ride/sunrise camel ride the following day, and climbing in the Atlas Mountains. The climb was amazing - I would say it is a moderate climb and you definitely require sturdy shoes/boots. The food presented at the top of the climb was fantastic considering the limited cooking equipment available to our muleteer!The 4 nights accommodation was good - the first night seemed to be a popular spot for travel groups and was comfortable. The second night was at the desert camp, which was great fun (although food was very late - about 10.30pm!), the third night was a delightful Riad/Guesthouse in Imlil valley which was beautiful (and we would definitely like to return here), and the last night is in a very basis guesthouse/gite in a traditional Berber village - it's a case of getting stuck in, but the mattresses are very comfortable and the views incredible!I would not hesitate to strongly recommend using this company for the above trip if you would like to experience many angles of Morocco. Day 3 is a long day spent travelling, but this is necessary to transport you from the Desert into the Atlas Mountains. We were grateful for the opportunity to catch up on sleep after the sunrise camel trek, but it is a long day. Great value for money, and we felt exceptionally safe and very well looked after by Abdul and Hassan."

This wasn't some lame 5 minute ride around a sandy field as I saw elsewhere. Instead it was along a track which offered fantastic views of the valley and which took us through villages where we passed smiling Berber children. After the trek we were met by the 4X4 and taken up to the base of Mt. Toubkal (the highest mountain in Africa!) where we ate a traditional meal before trekking on foot along a donkey trail to the highest village and an idyllic waterfall some way above the treeline. It was a truly memorable trip and we felt that we got full value for our money as the trip lasted all day."

They couldn't find our apartment so we had to walk to our nearest large hotel.Warm welcome from our driver. Met the owner half way along Mohammad VI to pay for the trip at the side of the road?Driver was informative on the way out but a tad on the way back. Used his phone continuously which made he journey feel a lot slower as he coasted most of the way.Excellent tour guide for the ourika valley, although on the website it states a short walk when it should state it's an hour long and you should wear trainers or walking boots, as flip flops and sandals really weren't appropriate so the walk up to the waterfall was mates by this. The tour guide however was attentive and friendly. Very intelligent with his knowledge of several languages etc.Food was ok, although be prepared to pay for your drinks. This is 3 courses.When booking we were told water was provided but this wasn't given until 2.5 hours later from leaving the hotel. Also, it was a 1.5l bottle to share between 4. As expected on the track this quickly disappeared to nothing so were especially thirsty b the time we ordered our food.All in all, a good value for money trip."

Trip organised efficiently through email after we arrived in Marrakech. Clear information and details and we modified what we had wanted to do as we have a young son. On the day we were picked up from our hotel by the wonderful Mohamed who was friendly, insightful and really an all round great guide. Full of information and stories! He stopped when ever we wanted to take photos as well as stopping at a Berber home and working mill, oil production coop ( great rest bite with a taster of the oils and tea) and a tasty traditional lunch all included in the cost. We could have continued to the waterfalls as well but chose to spend some time in the village at the 'roads end', walked across rope bridges to cafes and let my boys paddle with the locals in the river. Wonderful day filled with memories and hundreds of photos taken! Thank you to Mustapha and Mohamed!"

We found Atlas very accommodating by picking us up with our luggage in Marrakech and delivering the luggage to the Riad in Imlill whilst we did our ride and walk. The camel ride took a couple of hours, but in the baking sun I would say it was enough. we were then collected and taken to Imlill for a trek and lunch. Again, this took a couple of hours. It worked really well, though my only negative comment is that it was over by 2pm - a lot earlier than I was expecting. The lunch by a waterfall was very good."

A real eye opener and a great opportunity to see what Marrakech has to offer other than it's monuments, palaces, gardens and busy markets. I went to Morocco with my girlfriend at the end of May and prior to that we had plenty of contact with Adil (via email) who made sure that he catered for our needs. Adil was a real gent - punctual, polite, informative and spoke very good English and added some nice touches when he greeted us which went down well. He happily arranged for us to have a private tour (which we recommend).Our trip consisted firstly with a 20 min Camel ride which was good fun. We then savoured the unique experience of a Berber market which was very interesting. Adil then took us to see the local women making Argan Oil in it's traditional form and my girlfriend had fun interacting with the women and having a go at making it herself.We then proceeded to the highlight of the trip, a drive through the stunning landscape before ascending the Atlas Mountains. Not only did we consume the amazing scenery, we also had the humbling experience of meeting the Berber Villagers, being greeted by the droves of children as we drew near (We brought them gifts of colouring and activity books, games and a football which went down a treat - We wish we brought more as the delight on their faces was heart warming). We were also shown great hospitality and we were fed a beautiful traditional 3 course meal.We highly recommend this trip if you fancy getting out of the hustle and bustle of the Medina."

I would highly recommend the experience to anyone traveling to Marrakesh. We were picked up right on time from our Riad and smoothly transported to Imlil for the start of our trek. In Imlil we met our guide and muleteer. Our guide, Mohammed, spoke English well and was very familiar with the area, having grown up near Imlil and having guided here for the past six years. During the trek we stayed in gites and Berber inns along the way that were rudimentary but quite sufficient - and which only helped to put us out of our element a bit, in the best sort of way, as we had hoped and expected the trip to. Everywhere we went we felt safe and we met nothing but friendly faces throughout the hike. The valleys were beautiful, the villages fascinating, and the people inspiring! It was an experience of a lifetime that I will not soon forget!"

It was booked before we went to Marrakech, the driver picked us up on time and took us to meet our guide. We walked for a couple of hours through lovely scenery, climbing quite steeply, crossing some quite challenging terrain at one point to avoid a long walk round to get to the guides village. Here the guide was very attentive, taking us across one at a time and guiding where to put our feet. We then had a fabulous lunch in his house, cooked by his wife. The meat and vegetables in the tagine were glorious, accompanied by chicken on skewers, a massive salad with pasta and lots of unleavened bread, there was no way we could eat it all!!! We then walked back via the waterfall to the large village where our driver picked us up to return us to the hotel. It was the highlight of our trip to Marrakech and very well organised and safe."

The scenery and nature was amazing and our driver was quite unbelievable. He really looked after us and could not do enough to make us happy.We should have been a group of 8 but five of the group had to cut short the journey because of sickness. Mohammed and his colleagues at Atlas & Sahara tours organized the return to Marrakech and really took responsibility for our friends and made sure that they were well looked after. The one negative element that marred our trip was that we spent New Years Eve in the desert where a large German group had organized music turning the camp into a very noisy disco.Otherwise a wonderful experience."

I would say that Atlas and Sahara are far more ahead of their time then similar companies operating in the same market.The correspondence and organisation from Mohamad and Mustapha before we went was excellent. They stayed in regular contact and were reasonable about payment terms and prices. They helped reduce the price by putting me in contact with others who were interested in doing the trip, thus reducing our cost.Our driver spoke limited English, but was very aminable and friendly. He was able to portray the basics of where we were travelling to and what we were seeing and joined us for dinner on occassion. The two riads provided were more than adequate. The stay in the dessert and beber house was not particularly comfortable, but that is what you are signing up for. Our atlas trek guide was quite quiet, I suspect due to limited english - but when spoken to, he made a good effort to talk back. The trek and views were spectuctualar and highly recommended.The dessert stay was a little weird. We turned up and were whisked into a room with bored looking local 'musicians' who played a few songs and then asked us to buy their cds, we didnt. The jeep ride was fun and the views amazing of the dessert. The hospitiality when we got to the camp was pretty poor, we were not told anything about dinner times or offered a drink, we had to track people down and ask them. The camel ride back across the dunes was a highlight. There was a stop at a 'carpet factory' which was supposed to be imformative, but turned into quite the hardsell. But I think that comes with the territory in morocco and expected it at some point,We did a day drip enroute to the dessert around local farming land and visited a mosque which was all unexpected and actually very good.I think I also need to mention our cook on our Atlas Trek was excellent, taking pride in his work and generally being very happy and friendly and were our hosts in the berber home stay.I think they offer excellent value for money and would certainly recommend you book i"

            "review": "An amazing trip.. I feel very sorry for Jabula, (7th April 2013). He missed out terribly. Our experience of this company was completely the opposite of his. We booked a day walking tour to Imlil and seperately a five day trip to Erg Chegaga through \"Atlas and Sahara Tours\", now apparently 'Exotic Morocco Travel-Day Tours' at the end of March 2013, Both were excellent. Our driver thoughout was Abdul, we could not have asked for better. At Imlil we were guided by a fully qualified local man, Joel, a fluent English speaker whose knowledge and courtesy in showing us his country made our day extremely satisfying.A couple of days later we started our five day trip to the desert journeying on the first day to Zagora via theTiz n'Tichka pass, Ait Ben haddouu Kasbah and the Draa valley. Abdul was an experienced guide and steady driver who spoke good English. He was very considerate and took care to ensure our trip throughout was great fun as well as extremely interesting and stimulating. He repeatedly went beyond the planned itinerary, exploring oases off the main road or or taking us on less visited tracks through fantastic landscapes, en route our daily destinations. The Hotel Zagor, where we spent our first night, was acceptable but not brilliant. The next day we continued on to the Sahara stopping off at Kasbah villages and a pottery at Tagounite en route. At Ouled Driss a local guide took us through the labyrinthian \"undergrouund\" streets of the village and then to his house for lunch, a memorable experience.Once through M'hamid and off road, Abdul's driving changed as he demonstrated his prowess with his 4 by 4, charging across the dunes in an exhilerting dash to our camp for the night. We arrived in time to enjoy the sunset and an excellent meal. The camp, (managed by Alkouch Lohsen), was low profile, with friendly staff, small but very clean and comfortable with carpets, electric light and sprung beds in the tents! We were not roughing it. It suited us perfectly. The dunes were magnificent particularly in the evening and early morning light. We didn't bother with camels but enjoyed a guided stroll the following morning spotting wildlife and finding herds of camels but, unfortunately not their owners,the object of the walk. On returning to the camp Abdul set off to fix the issue and returned having arranged for us to meet a nomadic farmer in his nearby camp. The people of the desert have an extraordinary reputation but we were discovering just how threatened their legendary nomadic lifestyle is. The impact of climate change, inability to cross militarised borders and accelerating movement of educated children to more comfortable parts means that those we met were probably of the last generation. There were many highlights on our short trip and our visit to this farmer, a dignified 75 year old, was definitely one of them.We had another exciting drive back across the desert to M'hamid and Ouled Driss. We stayed the night at \"Dar Tahaya\", a small hotel, in the centre of the kasbah in the care of Hassan's family. From its flat roof we could see over the mud-built town to the palmery beyond, a sight just thousands of years old. By now the trip had taken on a near magical quality as we enjoyed even more Moroccon hospitality in, what was for us, exotic but nevertheless always comfortable suroundings. The following morning Housin, another local guide, booked by Abdul, took us on a fascinating tour of a nearby palmery village, the subject of inter-family rivalryand battles between nomads and farmers, in which his family had participated, just a few generations back.Our final night was spent at the Enakhile kasbah, N'kob, after tracking across a stupendous black and pitiless stoney desert enclosed by distant mountainous cliffs, an incredible landscape to the north of Zagora and missed completly by the guide books. Beyond the desert and on cliffs looking back over the town and out across palms to more distant mountains the hotel at N'kob was another find by Abdul which we really appreciated. (It helped that he seemed to know everyone wherever we were.) On the final day, driving back to Marrakesh through the Atlas, our driver still managed to cut away from the main road to find villages and valleys off the beaten track.In 50 years travel around the Mediterranean and its margins we have been lucky enough on occasion to find places that whilst equipped for tourism were yet to crushed and destroyed by the mass market. These trips beyond Marrakesh certainly fell into that category. Further, it was clear that Atlas and Sahara Tours were consciously endeavouring to put money directly into country communities by supporting individuals and start up enterprises there; we were told as much by people we met along the way. The pay-off for us tourists was immediate in the places we were taken to and the good will extended to the company everywhere we went. This sort of treatment, which we benefited from, is far beyond the reach of the average national or international company. We are very grateful to Mohamed for arranging the trips and being so flexible at short notice. I am sure he has other great drivers to call upon but we personally owe a debt of gratitude to Abdul for his work in making or holiday a complete success. We would unhestatingly recommend him. And oh, we were offered as much water as we required and it was free everytime !Be sensible don't try and do the desert trip in a day or two. Cut your time in Marrakesh which CAN definitely be done, without loss, in two days. Spend your time in the south where you will be amazed. Visited March 2013"

Our driver on the day was Mohammed. He grew up in the mountains and was an endless source of information and lovely stories throughout the day. His English was very good making it very easy to communicate. Mustapha had advised that Tuesday is a good day to travel into the mountains as there is a weekly Berber market. We took his advice and were so glad that we did. Overall we had a truly memorable day and thoroughly enjoyed Mohammed's company and stories. Mustapha was a pleasure to deal with and always prompt with email replies. We recommend Atlas and Sahara Tours highly."

            "review": "Mixed experience. We've just returned from Morocco where we spent four days with Atlas and Sahara tours. I hate to pour cold water on all the excellent reviews, but our experience wasn't entirely perfect.We booked Atlas and Sahara to take us from Marrakech to Zagora for an overnight camel trek to a Berber camp, then to Imlil in the Atlas mountains for a two day trek up Mt. Toubkal with an overnight at the Toubkal refuge.The good: Pre-trip communication with Mohammed was excellent. Accommodations in Imlil at Dar Amalou guesthouse were great and our mountain guide (also named Mohammed) was superb. The experience of hiking in the Atlas was great, even though we did not summit Toubkal because of bad weather. Seeing so much of Morocco's diverse landscape was wonderful.The bad:(1) Our driver from Marrakech to Zagora and on to Imlil did not keep his end of the contract. We did not stop at the film studio on Ouazzarete nor at the village of Ait Benhaddou on the way to Zagora because we \"didn't have enough time.\" We picked up plants in one town and delivered them in another. We stopped at his sister's house for tea and made several other unscheduled and unexplained stops at ATMs, coffee shops, gas stations and government offices. On the way back form Zagora to Imlil we insisted on stopping at the film studio and at Ait Benhaddou but the promised 1 hour tour of the village did not materialize. The driver did not speak English. Finally, water and drinks which were part of the contract were not included and we were told to pay for them ourselves.(2) Despite repeated queries about the likelihood of summiting Toubkal in early April, we were assured that it was a \"great time to climb the mountain.\" Maybe we were unusually unlucky with the weather, but we had six inches of fresh snow, the temps dipped to -13F with the windchill and the winds blew 40 mph. We have hiked all over the world and understand mountain weather conditions. It just would have been great to have a little more honesty up front.(3) When we discussed our grievances with Mohammed at the end of the trip, he blamed the driving company. He explained that drivers never speak English as they do not have the same level of education as tour guides. He also argued that drinks are never considered part of a meal. There were no apologies.What the traveller should know:(1) An English speaking driver does not mean a driver who speaks English. Ignore that promise in the contract. Take your best schoolboy French.(2) Meals apparently do not include drinks, even juice and water.(3) The packing list for Toubkal is a joke. Luckily we knew this. Do not attempt to summit in early spring unless you have plastic boots, gaiters, winter mountaineering parkas, and experience with crampons and ice axes.(4) Do not expect the overnight with the Berbers to be a cultural experience. The Berbers do not speak English, there was no opportunity to learn about their lives in the desert, with camels, the role of women, anything. To be fair, none of this was promised in the contract, but it is an opportunity missed. It is a 1 hour camel ride, mint tea, tangine dinner, overnight in a tent, camel ride out. No more and no less.Hope this helps."

We went on the one day hike up to the mountains, and it was simply one of the best trips i have ever had the pleasure of going on. We had our own private guide who was absolutely brillant. He told us about the history of the region, the Berber Village and about the country in general. The views are breathtaking, and my only regret is that we weren't there longer to take a 3 day trek up to mountains. When we first arrived, I was feeling very dodgy, and as we started our trek, i got quite ill and nauseous. I blamed it on the breakfast! But having said that, my mate who had the same thing wasn't sick. Our guide was a real gentleman and left me alone to expel everything! I was fine after 15 minutes, and we went on the trek. If you're worried about your fitness levels, don't be, because it's not all uphill and it's worth it just to see to the views. We had lunch at the house of our guide's brother, and it was my favourite meal on our trip (and we ate at a 5 star resturant). The meal was exquisite. We were picked up at our hotel promptly and we were dropped off after. It's all catered for and this is where i have to sing Mohammed's praises. He is your guy if you want to undertake tours in Marrakesh. He sorted us a guide to the Medina the following day and i have to say i was thankful for it. Our guide was english speaking and took us around for half a day. If we had been there longer, I would definitely have taken a few more of the tours - but we just didn't have the time. For me, this trip will always stand out. I can't recommend this company enough for your time there - all i can is that you won't be disappointed if you take one of their tours."

We spent two days trekking in the Atlas Mountains, organised by Mustapha. The scenery was breath-taking (they filmed 7 years in Tibet here apparently - according to Wiki!) - Cherry blossom, walnut trees and juniper adorn the hillsides. Our guides were friendly and knowledgable, even treating us to a performance on the Berber drum! We covered about 30 km, ascending 700m (we think) to 2500m - and arrived back at Imlil tired, but happy. The food was tasty, healthy and plentiful and we couldn't have asked for more. We just need an excuse to come back! Thankyou."

This was after a scenic drive and overnight in the Atlas mountains. Wished we had gotten to Merzouga sooner so we would have had time to climb the dunes and get pictures of the sunset. The morning was a little rushed getting back to the van, but the camel ride was a fun experience. Anwar was a terrific driver negotiating all those winding mountain roads and getting us safely to our destination."

Additionalyy half of the gruop was vegan, so we were really difficult to take care of. What I loved about the people from Atlas and Sahara that there were open for our ideas and needs, always ready to act and adapt, with a smile and positive attitude.

The whole day was superb - apart from the guide going to the wrong hotel but they made every possible effort to find us. The driver, the walking guide and Mustapha himself were all really committed to give us a great day and that is what we got. Out to the mountains and then a 3 hour trek with the pace set perfectly and with a generous spirit of help too when it got a bit tricky. Lunch in a Berber house was delicious and well done all round. The driving was safe and comfortable, even in the back, the 4x4 was modern and in excellent condition. I strongly recommend this company on the basis of their administration and output."

We (party of 7 women!) started the day by a 2-hour camel (or horse for some of us) ride in an amazing valley. We appreciated having a guide each to help us walk the animal. Really beautiful sceneries, fantastic pictures taken....Our main guide (who could speak English very well) was really attentive and experienced, explained a lot about local lifestyle. We then drove to Imlil where we had a simple but tasty lunch. The weather did not allow the walk we had planned but we were quite happy to wander in the village and enjoy the shops (with very friendly owners). The drive back to Marrakech was a bit an adventure as a huge storm started when we left, but our experienced driver (Hassan) made us feel very safe.Will definitely go back with husbands and kids!Also used Atlas and Sahara Tours for pick-up from and drop-off to the airport. Great service.I do highly recommend them!!!"

This is the 2nd time we have used Atlas and Sahara - last year a one day walking trek, this year a 2 day including climb to the summit of Mount Toubkal and an overnight stay in the refuge. As last year excellent from start to finish - picked up at hotel and taken to Imlil met Mohammed our guide from last year , who intoduced us to Mohammed who was to be our guide this year, cook and mule arrived. One reviewer said they felt sorry for the mules, admittedly it only carried one backpack and 2 sleeping bags along with food for us but I thought the mules looked well cared for and needed little cajoling to make the journey up and down. hey seemed both healthy and happy if you can tell if a mule looks happy!The ascent to the refuge took us about 4.5 hours, it is a steady incline, along a stony and clearly marked pathway Mohammed set a steady pace and was happy to stop if you needed a breather/ catch the views. We stopped en route and had a fantastic lunch - there is no way you starve on these trips and the standard of food was better than in our hotel!We arrived at the refuge - it is reasonably basic but has running water showers, bunk rooms a sitting area with a fire and dining rooms. Extra blankets were available if needed. Each group had their own cook who provided food - again excellent. Following day had a 6am start - it is a continual ascent - not tecnical, but there were some reviews that says no guide needed - obviously that does depend on experience and navigation skills, but in places particularly when there has been snowfall the path is not distinct. For those who have little experience and think its an easy peasy stroll please be warned , it is not common but someone did die ,falling from near the summit the night we were there- part of a group but no guide and I believe no grampons. The ascent and descent takes 5-6 hours, we did it in November and grampons were essential , snow was thick and icy in places. Mohammed was excellent - he had a great sense of humour , assisted when necessary but also gave you space to enjoy the environment. We arrived at the top - a great sense of achievement and fabulous views - and then started a steep descent - having not used grampons before I was happy on occasions for Mohammed to offer assistance. We arrived back at the refuge in nearly 6 hours having been a little slower descending as I suffered from some altitude sickness( just sickness no headaches) I believe there were others that day who didnt get to the top because of altitude sickness. Having got back to the refuge we had a further 4 hours back to Imlil , a lovely lunch was prepared but I couldnt do it justice - and Mohammed was more than happy for me to take my time and feel better before the journey - but I knew his mum was making couscous for his return and i was keen throughout our two days as part of my challenge to keep within time frames we soon set off - but with a clear path ahead we had a head start and left Mohammed, the mule and cook to cartch up ! it took us 3.5 hours to get back - and on reaching the road we were met by Brian our taxi driver. So to conclude brill 2 days, great organisation ,excellent guide , would I use again most definitely in fact Morrocco November 2013 is already on the cards - just need to read some of your reviews to find another trek - 2011 1 day , 12 2 days so its got to be longer next year. Thanks Mustapha at Atlas yopu have a great time and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend you or any of your team - WELL DONE !!"

Having read excellent reviews, myself and my friend Lucy booked onto the half day camel ride & half day hike with Atlas & Sahara Tours in April this year. We had a fantastic day with the limited time we had available to explore the Atlas Mountains. Mohamed & Mustapha who we booked the trip through online were extremely helpful & prompt in getting back to us with pre-trip queries and as promised we were picked up in Marrakech at 9.00am by our wonderful driver Assan. On arrival in Asni we met our guide Abdul who was full of knowledge of the local area and looked after us for the day. We then did a 2 hour camel trek to the other side of the valley through berber villages, Assan was there to meet us at the end of the trek to drive us to Imlil for lunch which was excellent. We then started our 2 hour hike through the Atlas Mountain villages facing Toubkal which was beautiful. We finished the hike late afternoon and were then driven back to our Riad in Marrakech. The service we received throughout was very professional and I would highly recommend Atlas & Sahara tours for exploring the Atlas Mountains. I would love to go back with more time in the future and climb to the summit of Toubkal and I would definitely book through Atlas & Sahara tours again. Thank you Abdul for a wonderful trip and to Assan and the rest of team for looking after us, we had a wonderful time!Sophie - UK"

Everything was very straightforward from booking to execution. We were picked up as promised from our Ryad and taken to Imlil in the Atlas mountains to begin the trek. There we were met by Mustapha himself and introduced to our guide, Mohammed, muleteer Ibrahim and our mules. The walk itself was billed as an \"easy and interesting\" two day walk. It was certainly interesting, not so much easy but perhaps that just shows how unfit I am! We spent the first day climbing up to the Tizi Mzik pass and then dropping down to a Berber village to spend the night in a very rustic Berber guest house. I had been worried this would be a bland affair but it was actually full of local colour. We were very fortunate as our trip coincided with a village festival. Mohammad took us along to watch and helped us made sense of it all. The next day we crossed over a slightly less intimidating pass to drop back into the Imlil valley and return to Marrakech. The girls, six and nine, loved having the mules to ride on and we would never have been able to walk so far without the support. We had great food all the way. We usually hate having guides, but Mohammad was very discreet and helpful, ready to make suggestions but always listening to what we wanted to do. Extra top service from Mustapha: we discovered on the morning of the trek that my elder daughter's boots didn't fit any more. He rang round his friends and found us a pair of boots for her to borrow. All round very impressive."

As we were only staying in Marrakech for 4 nights a 1 day trek in the Atlas Mountain range was as much time as my wife and I could afford.We investigated other excursion companies but found Atlas and Sahara to be the one that attracted us most due to their excellent reviews and prompt response to our enquiries.We were collected from our Riad at 9:00am in the heart of the Medina by our driver Abdul and transferred the 90 minutes journey to the Imlal Valley and met by our guide Mohammed. The trek through the mountain range and many villages was excellent and our guide was fantastic. He knew when to provide information and when to leave us to enjoy the splendours of the mountain range. This is a very important part of a guides role and one that Mohammed has obviously mastered.The trek was split up only for a lunch, prepared to our vegetarian request accompanied with some wonderfully refreshing mint tea.It should also be noted that I had made a small error in as much as I had arrived at the trek having brought an insufficient amount of euros in error. However, when I explained this on the telephone to Mohammed in the tour office he was very understanding and accepted my request to make my payment in part euros and part dirham without complaint. Excellent customer service.On completion of our trek we were again met by our driver Abdul at c.3:30pm and returned safely to Marrakech. Again, Abdul was an excellent driver who took care to drive at a reasonable speed and with courtesy. Whilst our trip at the start of the day was full of conversation and local information which we welcomed and enjoyed, Abdul was mindful that on our return journey we were tired and just wanted to rest.It should also be noted that there was no attempts by either driver or guide to take us to shops only willing to sell us there wares. This was very important to us as we wanted only to experience the mountain range and not to buy any goods which we didn't require.I would recommend Atlas and Sahara for any trek requirements in the Atlas range; Mohammed and Mustafa (office) arranged our excursion as they said they would and Mohammed and Abdul looked after us very well."

Stopped at a family house for tea, honey, which we bought a pot of, and bread and oil.Then we basically left the road for a track up the mountains, snow on the ground, and climbed up to a Berber house for a meal. My husband then walked part way down but I didn't!!This company, although not cheap, will accomodate what you want. Best money we paid out for views -unforgetable"

            "review": "Highly Recommended! Great Tour. My partner and I were only in Marrakech for a few nights, but we decided we definitely wanted to do some sort of tour to the Atlas Mountains. After researching online, we came across Atlas and Sahara Tours on Trip Advisor which had received some great reviews. We emailed regarding the Imlil Valley Tour and received a prompt response from Mohamed that evening. As first time trekkers, Mohamed responded to all our queries quickly. We then booked online the day before flying out and we\u2019re able to take part on the tour just two days later. We were picked up from our Riad and driven to the bottom of the mountains where we were met by our guide who spoke great English, (also named Mohamed). Mohamed was friendly and able to answer any questions we had whilst on the trek. He even got us some bottles of water, (as we had forgotten ours), and lent my partner his hat to protect him from the sun. Included in the Tour price was lunch cooked in a Berber home. My partner and I were able to sit back in the sunshine, relax and enjoy the mountain views whilst we ate our wonderful home cooked Moroccan lunch and drank tea. Throughout the entire trek no one was pushy or trying to sell you anything and it was far from touristy.It was a truly wonderful experience which we would highly recommend. Not only do you see some incredible views, but you walk away with some fantastic photographs and a great sense of achievement. Everyone, from our guide, to our taxi drivers, and the local Berber people were professional, warm and welcoming."

We had a short break to Morrocco in Nov/dec and wanted to do a days walking in the Atlas Mountains- we booked with Atlas and Sahara Tours - but when we got to the hotel we were told how expensive the tour was ( 70 euro pp) compared with others - naturally we were a bit worried but I contacted Mohammed who was very reassuring informed us that we really would be trekiing - not visiting , looking and wandering and how true that was ! We were rtaken to Imil valley where we met Mohammed who spoke great English, friendly but not in your face and humourous and of we went - a steady and gradual clim for about 3 hrs, a 15 min snack break , another hour then a suburb lunch made by Mohammeds wife ( couldnt get the recipe out of her tho) and sat on the veranda in beautiful sunshine in view of the mountains then off again through the villages and getting a glimse of life in the Atlas mountains. Then back to pick up vehicle- yes a brilliant day , no berber tourist shops , carpets, or anything touristy in fact we only saw 3 other non locals the whole time. But yes it was a trek sio if you want to wander , look and get back on the bus maybe not for you ! Was it expensive ,,,, no Mohammed it was worth every penny sorry to doubt you ! Would we do it again yes definitely and hoping to with maybe an overnight stop thrown in !! Thanks M and M !"

We had one of the best experiences in recent memory. They took extra care to make sure we arrived safely, with a pick-up right at our hotel. Constantly considerate of our comfort throughout the whole tour. Not to mention, there was no nickle and diming, nor were we forced to stop and shop. And most important, we were not rushed, we went at our own pace and chose where we went. This trip was all about the beautiful country and us experiencing it. We had a home made meal on the rooftop of their accommodations. We, unfortunately, did not stay there for the night, which I am sure would be top notch as well. I could go on and on, but I will not. Point blank, best tour company I have ever dealt with!"

Abdul, my guide, was terrific: he was able to tailor our journey to my pace (faster than normal, I'm an ultrarunner). From the time I was picked up at the airport, through many guesthouses and miles covered, to my final drop-off, I always felt like Mohamed and his team (including Abdul, Ibrahim, and even our mule guy) were on top of the situation and ready to accommodate--but not smother, because my independence is important to me when traveling. I would recommend Atlas to any level of traveler, whether seeking a very guided trip or a somewhat hands-off one."

Some friends and I were going to Marrakech for just a few days and wanted to ride some camels through the desert or see the mountains. If you want to go to the desert, you need a few more days, but we did an awesome one day trip (from 9am-6pm). When I first emailed the company, they just sent a vague itinerary with suggestions for a longer trip. But upon emailing them again, they sent a good itinerary for a day trip. They had someone get us at our hotel and walk us to the car. I was a bit skeptical because this person that walked us wanted a tip, and I read that a lot of these camel trek/hiking/desert/mountain tour groups make their money by charging you extra for everything. But I was pleasantly surprised because we were not charged for water they provided and a few other extras (i.e., fruit). The roads don't really have lane markings and can be a bit dangerous, but our driver was a professional. I felt really safe, but I did get carsick (typical for me). We met our guide, Muhammed, and we rode camels to Imlil. The camels were great and a lot of fun. For the most part they seemed well taken care of, but there was a male camel that was in questionable health. The camel had some sort of big yellow thing coming out of its mouth (possible infection?) and flies all over its face. It also had a mesh muzzle and kept making lots of grunts and they kept it in the back of the line. It's always a concern when animals are used, but maybe this camel was just fine. I'm not an expert. It was amazing to ride the camels through the berber villages, but I would prefer if the male camel we had was in better health.Mohammed took some great pics of us with the camels - he offered to take pictures whenever we wanted. He could have made suggestions for pictures (\"stand here\" or some directions), but he's a guide, not a photographer. He was not just an informative, polite, fun guide, but he was also patient. We could tell that he was a local and he interacted with many people on our tour, which was really great and made for an authentic trip. We had the BEST food for lunch; it was served in a local berber's home. It was amazing! The lamb tajine was incredible - the best thing we had eaten the entire trip. And they brought us some fruit for dessert - the lemons and pomegranate tasted like nothing I have had before. They said that if you take a longer trip this is a place you can stay overnight. It would probably be worth it for the food alone!The hiking was fun but definitely a little challenging (some steep, narrow paths and such). It was true hiking - not just walking. I'm sure if you ask they can set up an easier route. Seeing the berber villages was incredible! It was amazing to see how other people live, and they were very welcoming. We saw so many incredible things on this journey - it was unforgettable! Doing a trek like this is a must if you are going to Morocco. It's an absolutely incredible experience, and is off the tourist track. Everything is really local and authentic. We took longer than expected but there was no extra charge and no one rushed us. Overall, an amazing experience. You have to do a camel ride/hike/trek when you go to Morocco!Recommendations if you go: a coat and scarf with long pants was necessary as it was pretty cold. Use a backpack if you must (not a purse). Bring toilet paper and hand sanitizer, just in case. Bring water as well."

We hiked up to Tizi Mzig (2584m) and we are not experienced hikers, so Mohamed was great at taking his time with us and making sure we were ok and made it to the top in one piece. (it took around 3 hours to get to the top). the views from there are amazing!! we took a slight different route on the way down and ended up in a Berber village were we had some lunch - I still think it was the best Tagine we had anywhere in Morocco. I can definitely recommend using Atlas and Sahara Tours, they can tailor the trip to your needs and what you want to see, and its very good value for money."

We passed through countless Berber villages, on many occasion being invited in for mint tea. Abdul my guide was friendly and enthusiastic, volunteering historical, geographical and cultural information throughout.The 2 nights were spent in modest Berber guest houses, one night being treated to a fabulous homemade chicken tagine. On the trek we saw hawks, quails, squirrels, lizards and lots of goats! Not only was this a serious work out on the legs it was also an authentic way of seeing the Berber way of life.A nice touch from the company was to arrange transfers to and from the airport.

I will tell you this...your driver and guide will make or break your trip, and for us Mohamed 100% made our trip. He is an excellent guide and totally committed to making your experience perfect. I loved the itinerary Atlas tours put together for me but i strongly recommend going with Mohamed if you can because he was such a great guide. Also of all the cities I listed, Imlil is probably the one you never heard of. Not too many people go there but I STRONGLY recommend it as it was my favorite day. That is where Mohamed is from - high up in the atlas mountains near mount tubkal. It's a beautiful escape from the cities and provides some spectacular views and insight into the mountain life. Kasba Toubkal, was one of the best \"hotels\" you can stay at. Look them up online and see for yourself. That place is a hidden gem!Lastly, you spend a lot of time in the car traveling from city to city. I was worried we were going to get a tiny car that we wouldn't be comfortable in or that wouldn't have air conditioning.

We got a wonderful meal and went to sleep quickly!

We picked Atlas and Sahara Tours as they had good reviews on trip advisor, including reviews by other families with children, and we were equally impressed. We have twin 12 year olds plus a 6 year old who has never done anything like this, so it was really important to have a company that genuinely understood families and could tailor accordingly. They picked an excellent route for us - not too ambitious, though still challenging - and the mule provided for my daughter to ride on worked out out great - and was great fun for her and her two brothers - though she did walk too! She didn't much like the steep narrow descents on a mule, preferring to walk those - can't say I blame her! Our guide, Abdul, was very helpful and came from the local area. Considering it was Ramadam and very hot when we were there he did an amazing job. The guest house we satyed in was very basic but was clean, and the company arranged for us to have sheets & blankets provided as we couldn't bring sleeping bags without busting our Ryan Air baggage allowance. I thought the price was very reasonable - we paid \u00a3350 for two days including one nights accommodation and all food with guide, cook & 3 mules plus efficient and comfortable transport in a 4x4 to and from Marakech.The communications were excellent both beforehand with Mohammed by email, and when we arrived with Mustafa who also met us at the end. Everythign was as discussed and promised.Handy tip - if you go in August pack some light breathable waterproofs as summer storms crop up. Mustafa was very helpful ran around on our behalf arranging hire of waterproofs while we set off, and then drove them up to us en route but this is obviously not the ideal (or cheapest) solution!Also in August be aware it is is still very hot , though fresher than down in Marrakech.I would love to go back and do one of the more challenging treks and would highly recommend the company!! will try to post some pics if my teccie skills can cope - the landscapes were amazing, and loved the Berber villages perched on the hlilsides."

We were two women and two 10 yr old children. We went on a three day 2 night trek. Next time we would do 3 nights 4 days (as they actually recommended). The guide was Dris, the cook was Hassim and the muleteer Brahmin (sorry guys if I've spelt your names wrong). They made the experience from start to finish; they were professional, informative and totally committed to making our time work. This meant brilliant food, great local knowledge and insights, humour, patience. They were fantastic with the kids, funny and kind. It was tough the first day as unusually for the time of year it hailed, rained and snowed for the first day. We were walking for many hours (our choice) and it could have been pretty grim but they kept our spirits and speed up and we made it to the gite. They organised huge numbers of blankets, cooked great food and were flexible about the plans for the next days. The mountains were beautiful, the villages were fascinatinmg, the people were very friendly, but what made the trek were Dris, Hassim and Brahmin. I would totally recommend them and this amazing area"

They provided an extra mule for the 6 year old, and a muleteer (Hassan) who took great care of her. Our primary guide, Abdul, was just wonderful. He had a great knowledge of the mountains, was extremely friendly, and did everything possible to make our trip good. It snowed on our third day, making it impossible for the mule carrying our 6-year old to climb to the pass planned for that day. So our trip had to be completely reorganized in the middle, and Abdul did a great job. Be sure to take your own sheets. Some of the \"guesthouses\" at which we stayed were not just primitive, but also quite dirty. All in all a wonderful trip. Thank you Abdul!"

This was organised for us by Atlas and Sahara Tours and it was first class. I stayed with our two teenage boys in the Dar Imlil hotel and we then walked to the refuge and stayed two nights there in fantastic snowy conditions - such a contrast to Imlil and Marrakech! Our guide, Abdul, couldn't have been more helpful and he took the boys up Toubkal while I pottered around in nearby valleys. A mule and another guide were also provided and some extremely good food was provided during our trek - the only problem was there was too much of it and we felt guilty leaving it. Abdul also sorted out crampons and ice axes for the boys. Booking anything by email can be worrying, but this company wouldn't even take a deposit from me which I thought was pretty amazing in this day and age. We're hoping to go back next year and possibly do a desert trek with them, so they must be good for us to be planning a return already!"

Like one of the other reviewers, the cost was less than other trekking companies and as far as I know, did not leave out anything. In fact, for \u20ac200 per person we had a guide, a mule, a chef, 3 nights in guest accommodation with hot showers each night (even a hammam for 20 Dirham pp was available on the last night) - in comparison to other treks that I've done (showers?!!) this felt like luxury. (We were quoted \u00a3295 pp from a UK based company for I think pretty much the same thing)The food was fantastic, thanks to Mohammed our fabulous chef, Jacqueline the mule carried all our stuff and Idriss our guide was polite, friendly, informative - we had a lot of fun. On average we walked 5-6 hours per day (although longest was 7.5 - we opted to go further to see a waterfall). Generally I would describe the route as moderate (although, of course, that all depends on fitness etc).Anyway - I would thoroughly recommend Toudaoui Brahim & Mohamed, a local Imlil based company, for your trek in the Atlas."

We were treated both as treasured guests and as family for the entire experience. We planned it ahead of time with Mohamed by email who always responded the same day or the next morning. He understood that we wanted a vigorous trip with nice accommodations and planned it perfectly. The airlines lost two of our bags. No problem. We made a detour to the Moroccan equivalent of Walmart and replaced what we needed. On the way to our hotel in the mountains, we passed a bazaar in progress. With great cheer, we made the unexpected stop and enjoyed the food, crafts, color and personalities and then returned to the comfortable van and moved forward. The Inn at Dar Imlil was not full and our accommodations were upgraded at no cost. The rooms were palatial and the views of the valley and mountains gorgeous. The stars at night were themselves worth the price of the trip. We hiked for two days on wonderful trails through terrific scenery and mountain villages with curious children who loved their instant pictures on the iPhone camera. The guide, lunch and lunch spots were excellent. But the unanticipated problems brought out the best in Mohamed. On one day, my wife developed blisters and Mohamed arranged for a respite donkey ride to allow her to continue. We were running late and Mohamed was in touch with the guide by cell phone, arranged for a shorter route down and picked us up by van to get us back to the hotel for a hot shower and delicious dinner. Mohamed was a good friend who made sure that the trip worked for us and we will always be very grateful. Dalia and Ira"

I still am. The tour was taylored to the time we wanted and the number of people in our trip, and was organised very well.

They (Siad, in the office) were able to completely tailormake the trip we wanted and offer suggestions and options. My wife and I wanted a fairly authentic experience and Dunesline were able to offer a night with a Berber family. We were not sure how this would pan out, or if it would really be authentic,but it was a fantastic experience, however, to do this one has to be happy to step well out of their comfort zone and it may not be everyone's cup of tea :-)I found many trips that were twice the price of our trip with Dunesline. Most of these operators seemed to be European based. Dunesline is a local business and therefore there are no foreigners clipping the ticket. The hotel accommodation that we were put up in was superb, and we couldn't really see how a more expensive trip could be justified.Hmad, our driver and guide, picked us up from our riad in Marrakech and took us over the Atlas Mountains and into the Sahara. He was (is) a fantastic guy and we still keep in touch. His English was very good and he was an excellent guide. We leaned much about the country and people from him and he certainly added an extra dimension to our trip. The vehicle was good, the accommodation superb, and as pretty seasoned travellers, we have to say this has been one of the best trips we have done.All this said, this kind of trip needs to be undertaken only by those with an open mind that wish to learn about a poor, dry, country. You spend quite a lot of every day driving in hot, remote countryside - but it is very beautiful and the Berbers are really nice, friendly people. Of course you are in a comfortable landcruiser with air con. A lot of these people are very poor and while I don't like being ripped off, I was very happy to let go of some dirhams as I saw fit. In Marrakech you can give some poor old beggar something without being swamped by lots more of them. You need to do a bit of reseach and take basic and obvious security and hygiene precautions, but there is basically no alcohol in Morroco so you feel very safe, even late at night.We originally planned to just visit Marrakech. The trip over to the Sahara was just an add-on which turned out to be one of the greats."

He had a pretty new 4x4 Toyota Land Cruiser, was both driver and our guide for the day. He collected us from our hotel in Marrakech at around 8 in the morning. The drive took us through several Berber villages and at one village we stopped to visit a family and have some mint tea with them (didnt care for the mint tea but then coffee drinker!). The road twists and winds and one climbs higher and higher, villages of Tahnnaout and Asni lie on this route. Small communities with a few shops is all what make up these pretty villages at the foothills of the Atlas Mountains. The roads are well maintained in many places, but we also had some good off roading, stopped for good but simple lunch, all in all a really good and very interesting day!Lahoucine Bouhtit tel +212 661695643 or email him on Bouhtit@hotmail.com"

We are not mountain climbers nor are we out of shape. We live in Toronto which is at sea level so I think the altitude slowed us down. We kept a slow pace, and enjoyed the scenery. The refuge was simple. You need your own sleeping bags. They are dorm type rooms with bunk beds side by side or you can bring a tent and camp. The refuge had water, pop, snacks and food for sale. We had the group dinner which was soup, spaghetti, water, mint tea for 50duram each. Straight to bed after dinner. We woke at 5am and started out by 5;30am. Its best to start early so you aren't walking up in the sun. We reached the summit at around 9am. The descent was very difficult as it was loose rock which causes you to slide down hill. I was honestly wishing I had hiking poles with me. Made it back to the refuge by 1pm. Had a 30min rest then headed back down to Imlil. We arrived in Imlil shortly after 5pm.  We didn't get a guide and found the trail very obvious. When it wasn't we simply had a rest and let another group pass us, then we followed them. Bring a hat, sunscreen, and lots of water. We carried up the minimum for clothes, decided to be dirty and just hike in the same thing for two days. There were people who brought up all of their bags by donkey/horse. If you plan to stay up for a few days and do many hikes (there are more than just Toubkal) then bring all your stuff. Otherwise leave it in Imlil and be dirty. Give the animals a break."

The 2 hour quad biking experience was great, our guide led us through up to an amazing viewpoint and then through several Berber villages. Mabruk (who helped us book the experience and came with us on the day) and Omar (our driver) were lovely and they even took us on a mini detour to take some photos on the way back. We loved every minute and are hoping to book another tour through this company when we revisit Marrakech in November."

He went to the trouble of letting me connect to his Internet and then calling the person we're staying with. I cannot thank him enough. All of the people at the shop are wonderful. They even invited us to break fast with them, which made me feel like I could really get involved with the Morrocan culture. The mint tea is beautiful, the best in the medina. We did the tour to Vallee Ourika which was perfect for our short stay in Marrakech as it's only around an hour to drive. We went to a traditional Berber house to have tea and bread and honey. We then went to the place where they make Argon oil and a lovely girl told us all the history in English. It is expected that you tip, so make sure you have some small notes.The lunch down by the river was traditional Morrocan cuisine and was tasty. I paddled in the river which was incredibly refreshing, and the service was good.We then drove to the waterfall, it was stunning. Take a bathing costume because you can swim, although it's so cold. Suitable footwear needed for the rocky terrain, not good for kids or the elderly. It is beautiful. Lovely photo opportunity and great way to cool off after the 20 minute climb in 40 degree heat. Our driver, Abdul was fantastic. Even though it is Ramadan, you wouldn't know. He was informative and friendly. Excellent driver and it was a comfortable car. He also took photos for us with our camera.Overall I really enjoyed it, and it was very reasonably priced compared with the competitors both online and around the medina. Thank you!"

We were a little nervous about going on desert tours with guys we didn't really know so we hesitated to book a 2 or 3 day excursion. After a few days of bumping into them regularly, and drinking lots of Berber tea, we got brave and tried a day tour. We had an excellent day touring the mountains and exploring a berber village and house, eating lunch in a riverside restaurant and visiting a women's cooperative that produces argan oil products. We got a little braver and looked at the photos and itinerary for the longer tours and decided to go. Unfortunately before we could book I got sick, and these guys offered us help and support every day, checking to see how I was and offering advice. We came away with new friends and will definitely be going back to spend some proper time in the desert with them. Thank you Mabrouk, Mohamed and Hossam"

He was friendly, very kind, took very good care of us and entertained all of our requests, however silly there were (like asking to drive us to a cheaper place to eat when we were already seated in a fancy-ish restaurant). 8 days with him was very fun and we were very sad when he had to leave to go back to Marrakech. At first I was a bit reluctant to go on a trip with this tour but it was worth every penny and I highly recommend for anyone who wishes to travel to Morocco to go with this company.

The accommodation that was booked is really good and comfortable with a delicious breakfast everyday. Omar, our tour guide is a friendly and funny tour guide who make us feel like we are travelling with our own family member! Although the trip from one place to another place is quite far and required us to spend a lot of time in the car, we feel relaxed as the tour is flexible and we do not need to rush to follow the itinerary as the itinerary is well prepared by the tours. Besides, we really enjoy the scenery from Atlas Mountain which is covered with snow to the dunes of Sahara Desert as Omar would pull over for us to take picture of the beautiful scenery and he would tell us a bit about the places that we stop. The camel rides and star gazing experience in the Sahara Desert is really enjoyable and beautiful! Hassan also take care of our well being by contacting us once a time to make sure that we get all the things we need. I will recommend this tour to my friends as it is worth the money that we spend with the experience that we got during this trip. Overall, I really enjoyed and glad that I had pick this tour to organize my trip in Morocco."

I am fully satisfied from the very moment we arrived at the Marakkech Airport till the last moment. ( Marakech Airport straight to Casablanca-Rabat(did not sleep there)-Fes-Sahara-Todgha-Marakech)Our guides Hassan and Umar are the best. They brought us to the wonderful places and always being flexible in choosing our destination in each places. They also tend to discuss with us about the destination and always recommend the best.Nabil, our guide in Fes is the best and lovely. He knows every single thing in Fes so dont worry you wouldnt leave that place without knowing nothing and he also helped us a lot shopping there. Instead he was the one who help us to bargain the prices and like i said he knows the best about Fes. So we did get the good prices with a very high quality goods. Next is Sahara Desert. We supposed to arrived there from Fes before sunset but we couldnt make it because it's winter time and sun tend to set faster. It take 7 hours for you to arrive in Sahara from Fes, but we couldnt make it as we stop at few beautiful places otw to sahara. But then we still can ride the camel while watching sunrise as we went to the camp by jeep and went back to the hotel with camel the next day. So it does make your life easier as it is flexible. Todgha Gorges also beautiful. You can get the feel of living at small villages between the big mountain with the sound of river from your room. Brothers at Sahara Desert Camp are wonderful. They welcomed you from the moment where you arrived and guide you to the tent and have dinner a together. If you are same like me, dont worry there is toilet in the desert. They set a bonfire and played their traditional songs i guess. Stragazing at Sahara is the best. It is not a scenery that you can capture with camera.Go and look on your own! Riding camel also one of the best memory :)So if you chose to go with Morahara, Do include Sahara Desert cause our original plan did not include sahara, but we asked to. So basically you can create the tour based on what you like and they will recommend what is the best. So after all, i can say that i am really satisfied with the Morhara Travel and it worth every penny you paid. We were so sad when leaving Morocco and it has been 4 days since we arrived in UK, but we are still missing Morooco. The hotels we stayed also gave the best services.Beautiful country with the kind hearted people, family. #CouscousSisters #SevenSisters"

Excellent driving skills with long hours drive especially in the Atlas mountain and throughout the journey from Sahara to Todgha Gorge. All the accommodation is very excellent!! Really convenient and exceed our expectation. Maamoura Hotel in Casablanca, Hotel Blue Sky in Fes, Kenneria Hotel in Marrakesh, Dar Ayour guesthouse in Todgha Gorge. Overall is very amazing! Really recommended!! Thanks Hassan and Umar for a very great journey together with 7 sisters from Malaysia =) #7couscoussisters"

But I honestly do feel that way.We spend 8 days 7 nights in Morocco. Mor'hara organized everything on point. They are super flexible i.e. we wanted to do the \"Cities of Splendor Loving Sultans\" tour and requested for one night in the Sahara desert, Liz took care of it, noooo problem.Hassan and Umar drove the 7 of us around. They are super friendly and really took care of us. We had Nabil as our guide in Fes (Awesome guy) and Abdul Salam in Marrakech. The accomodations in every city, as well as in Sahara, are better that I expected.The downsides: We didn't get to go to some of the places stated in the itinerary, especially in Marrakech. And one time in Fes they took us to an expensive restaurant for dinner. So I think you better tell the guides before hand, what are your price range for food.But other than that, everything was just amazing. The trip went smoothly and surprisingly quick. 8 days are not enough for me. I wish I could stay longer :( Will deffo come again soon. Mor'hara FTW!"

Hassan too very patiently be with us throughout the 7 days. cheering our days with his sense of humor. As we are Muslims, it is a very convenient trip whereby they stopped us when it was pray time. very helpful. excellent hotels and unforgettable memories with Hassan, Umar, Nabil-our tour guide in Fez which for me was the best tour guide ever, Abdul Salam-keep laughing with us throughout the day in Marrakesh, and all Morroccan people who always make du'as and welcoming us along the journey.have never thought to become overly attached with Hassan, Umar and all Morroccans. Hassan and Umar were like our fathers who take care all 7 of us. oh not to forget, their skills in driving the car all the day. more than 5 hours driving. the Sahara's friendly people, Todgha, Dades Valley and every single moment would last forever in my memory. couldn't ask for more. Mor'hara is the best *Thumbs up*. May God bless Mor'hara"

I call myself lucky that friends introduced me to his little shop and agency in the busy road of Riad Zitoun Jdide where genuine hospitality, a friendly hi and \"hello, how was your day\" welcomed me whenever I passed by. Patiently Idriss explained to me all the different tours they offer as well the meaning and traditions of the diverse beautiful stuff exhibited inside. I decided just for a short day trip upon his recommendation to the valley of Ourika and the waterfall in a small group. Well organized I was picked up without delay with a few other people - which turned out to become a lovely group. On the way the driver was always ready for a short stop to take a few shots to inhale the breath taking beauty of the mountain side in autumn in its golden colors. We stopped for good in Si Fatme where a local guide led us up to the waterfalls, always kindly supportive and patient for taking a view around, taking photos or just absorbing the beauty of this landscape - there are many photos on google images giving an idea about it, but the air, the breeze, the colors, the pure nature is much more beautiful than one might guess. I felt very grateful for this advise of this day trip!!! The lunch, taken at the river side was delicious and the tour back was very calm as everyone had to cope with the flood of impressions and the ravishingly beautiful landscape just before sunset. I felt very encouraged to go for more tours, but as my holidays had come to an end I can only count for the day to return and do more tours organised by Mor'hara. Marrakesh by itself is enchanting - but these day trips or tours are opening doors to a different quality of Morocco!! I'll be back soon!!"

My boyfriend and I were staying in Marrakech for a few days and by chance came cross the Mor'hara Tours shop when walking through the Souks on our first day. We are from Scotland and we were astounded to learn the company's Scottish connections, it was definitely fate! They were so friendly and welcoming and invited us to join them for a lovely mint tea in their little shop. There are many different tour options from day tours to the coast or longer tours to the Sahara. As we only had a couple of days we decided on a day trip to Essaouira as we fancied a visit to the beach.The team were so flexible and helpful, as Hassan offered to meet us at our Riad in the morning so he could take us round to his jeep. We had a fantastic day at the coast and stopped along the way to visit the goats in the trees, an argan oil co-operative and we also paid a visit to the village where Jimi Hendrix lived in 1969.Lunch was absolutely fabulous. We told Hassan we loved fish so he took us to the port to pick up some fresh fish, and some bread and salad from the markets. The food was then cooked and served to us on a roof terrace with mint tea and fresh fruit. Delicious! Hassan is a very good driver and we felt very safe with him, especially when arriving back in Marrakech during rush hour (that was an experience in itself!).The guys are so hospitable and I cannot recommend them enough. We met and had tea with them a few more times before our departure a few days ago. As Mubarak said, it is a small shop with a big heart. When we come back to Marrakech we will definitely be doing the Sahara tour!"

My trip with Hassan was from Marrakech to Zagora and out to the desert. His English is good, his driving is excellent and his care factor to ensure that the client has an enjoyable time is his priority. The overnight desert trip was simply amazing. Sleeping outside under the stars and waking to the eerie silence of a rose-colored vision of endless sand was a breath taking experience. I would definitely recommend Mo'hara Morocco Tours to anyone contemplating a tour of any type, as they will tailor a tour to suit your budget and your taste, promptly and efficiently.

Adil picked us up from Jemma el-Fnaa square near our riad, and he was immediately very friendly. Our drive was smooth and fun, as Adil would play different traditional Moroccan and African music and explain their significance to us. He arranged for a local guide at Ouzoud to take us on a hike around the falls, and it was fantastic. We were able to get to places around the falls that larger tour groups couldn\u2019t. We got along so well with Adil and enjoyed our day trip to Ouzoud that we asked Adil if we could do a four-day desert trip from Marrakech to Fes. Adil immediately agreed and put together a great trip for us. On our first day of the road trip \u2013 which admittedly was a very long driving day \u2013 we stopped at so many interesting places: Ait Ben Haddou, Ouarzazate, and the Valley of Roses among them. In addition, any time we passed a particularly scenic overlook, Adil was happy to pull over and let us get out to take a picture. He booked us in an absolutely beautiful hotel with a gorgeous view in the Todra Gorge. The next two days of our trip were spent in Merzouga in the desert. They were truly amazing. We visited a Berber village, listened to an African music troupe, and took a private camel trek into the sand dunes where we spent the night at a beautiful campsite, eating great food and enjoying the stunning landscape and night sky. Adil was really flexible with our schedule along the way. At one point in the middle of our tour, we were deciding between switching our trip to three days and going to Chefchaouen or staying with our original plan and spending an extra day in the desert before making it to Fes. Adil was very kind to help us brainstorm our best options either way, and was happy to rearrange our trip if we wanted to. It really felt like a personalized trip. We decided to stay in the desert as planned, and enjoyed meeting a nomad family and getting extra time to hike through some sand dunes. On our final day, Adil arranged for us to take a mini-bus to Fes with some other travelers. What\u2019s really amazing is that, after our eight-hour trip with another driver, Adil called us to make sure we had arrived in Fes. Then he called our riad to see if someone would be able to meet us and walk with us through the confusing streets of the medina so we wouldn\u2019t get lost. (We had already begun walking and luckily found our riad!) Adil checked on us again, remembering our schedule, when we were arriving in Casablanca to make sure we got there safely and to see if we needed any help arranging a ride to the airport. He really went beyond the typical tour guide in this regard. He really cared about our comfort and experience in Morocco even after our tour with him ended, and he kept in contact with us and offered help whenever we needed it. Adil made sure we had the best time and saw as many wonderful sights in Morocco as possible."

This time I was staying for a longer duration, but various different people were joining me, but going back-and-forth on flights at different points. When I needed an airport transfer and spoke about various excursions in Marrakech, I came into contact with Adil through recommendation. He contacted me via Whatsapp and then called me directly on my phone at a convenient time whilst I was in the UK. He did keenly send me all the prepared information on excursions and places of interest via Whatsapp. I had visited these places but didn't know some of the facts behind them so it made an interesting read.I mainly asked Adil for airport transfers, where one of the most reassuring things I felt even after my call was that he was always so responsive to any questions I messaged him with. You can appreciate 'responsiveness' can be really hit-and-miss with some transfer services. Adil checked all the necessary information about luggage, sent us his personal photo for identification, a photo of his jeep, and met us on arrival holding the name plate up as expected. As we agreed a set price (in dhs) all was clear with no issues. Change up some money at the airport to pay in dirhams. On arrival, when we got into his jeep and he immediately provided us with a WiFi password, he put on some amazing upbeat music en-route to our hotel, and all the group were clapping......we just knew with this type of greeting, we were about to have a great time in Marrakech! On the same night we checked-in to our hotel, we were out late and we wanted to buy some water (the hotel mini-bar was not an option). I has WiFi in the restaurant and whatsapp'd Adil on where I could get large bottles from. He was so helpful that he insisted on bringing the water bottles to us directly! 15 minutes later he pulled up in his jeep and waved at us on the open terrace where we were dining. A member of the group was unwell at dinner and he agreed to take her back to the hotel, along with the water, and as someone had to escort her to the room, he also bought the accompanying friend back to finish her meal as it was all within a 10 minute drive. Whilst of course we paid for the water and drive to/back to the hotel (only local prices) it was the small personal and helpful touches (service literally to our feet!) I think is something that you cannot forget with Adil, and it was great that he was free that night. Even when Adil was in the desert with excursions on several occasions, he was still able to respond to messages at occasional points and send from his network of drivers the airport transfers. He always provided us with the name of the driver and also a description of the car, they were always on time. We used his service 5 times for the airport during the trip.There were also Atlas Mountains excursions x 2 groups at different times. We knew how we wanted to plan each excursion, and while you can take on board suggestions from Adil, you do not have to follow the plan given. Tailor make what you want (take out the craft stop-offs if you wish) and fix your price. On one trip Adil drove us there, and the other time another of his drivers. Again on both occasions there was always fun en-route and plugging in our phones to play our music and the drivers were always clapping and laughing. We allowed 6 hours from hotel pick-up to return hotel drop-off (but we did not do any stop-offs). Upon reaching the Atlas mountains the easy entry point I found (tested 3 times!), was a small wooden slatted entrance bridge a few yards along from a dark blue painted restaurant (I have forgotten the name! but it sounded French) on the opposite side of the road.This restaurant is also the best place to confirm as a meeting point (if you do not have a moroccan sim phone) as when you are dropped off, the pick up time is roughly agreed. I think 2-3 hours for the mountains to reach the main waterfall is usually enough! This restaurant was also one of the few places that has western toilets that were relatively well maintained. We also ate the set menu (100dhs or 150dhs set menus) there in the upholstered seating area (which is by the stream) which you get to by using the small bridge opposite the main restaurant from the road/set-down area. You can just order a la carte.Along that small stretch, there are various places you can eat where there are all fairly standard offerings (set price 100dhs or 150dhs menus), but on another occasion we stopped at one of restaurants within the Atlas mountain levels, which had a decent European toilet and washroom facilities and just ordered tagines from standard menu to share and found it was enough. When returning from the Atlas mountains, I recommend driving directly (rather than doing any stop-offs) back, you will appreciate the resting time in the car, the scenic unhindered drive, with some relaxing music, which leaves you with enough energy for any evening you have planned. Once thing we found was Adil's name was very well-known! Especially to many road check-point staff and in restaurants.  Although I initially felt like Adil co-ordinates a large vehicles and excursions business, I found he was very personable and was always able to help on small matters! We had the idea to visit the Palmeraie, which on the face of it sounds like a theme park style area (but it is not!). I read some Tripadvisor reviews about the ease of going there and caught a taxi there. But it is a vast area, and unless you direct the taxi driver to somewhere very specific, you will be taken to a random location (with no WiFi) where it feels like it in the middle of nowhere, and because the taxi driver will have overcharged for the journey, and expect a kick-back from the one waiting guide, the taxi will be keen to wait for a return journey. After realising we were not exactly sure of where we were and how it really all worked, we could not see much around - but were luckily in a small cafe, I asked the cafe staff to phone Adil. He spoke to them and managed to locate us and I was pleased to see him! He explained how the quad-bike/camel riding trips worked and drove us to the area and explained all about the Palmeraie which seemed like 20 minutes away from where we were dropped off. As much as we appreciated the information, we were too hot and bothered and realised we did not change enough cash, and also wasted so much time by then, we decided not do the quad-biking. The reassurance of Adil picking us up helped changed our mood, and we did not waste the entire day, as we asked to be dropped off in Guilez the modern district with the shopping centre and Starbucks. Upon reflection, I feel the Palmeraie was something that should be booked as a planned excursion, but it is something that I have yet to experience.In Marrakech you will find people are generally receptive, but like all holidays you will determine the worth of your trip based cost, which often equals how enjoyable it was for you personally and how smoothly and hassle-free it runs (in a city where negotiation is key)."

            "review": "Somewhat fun, but impersonal tour. I must admit my expectations were probably a bit too high, seeing all the positive reviews made me sure this was THE company to book a tour with. Adil met up with us at our riad and we had a short discussion where we discussed the different tours he could offer. We finally decided to do the Ourika valley and the Essouira tour. He was helpful and professional and i got a really first good impression. One of the key sellings points of choosing the private tour was that we would be skipping all the \"tourist\"-stuff that tries to sell you something. However, as the tour started, we soon realized we were on a rather set program that everyone does. We were able to skip some of the rather obvious and uninteresting stops, such as the pottery making shop and some metal workshop, which was nice, but we weren't able to escape it completely as i had hoped. At the berber village we were sent into a argan oil \"factory\" and felt obligated to buy something in the end, at the herboriste in the end of the tour, again we were treated to a huge commercial show, and felt we had to purchase something. It was a bit disappointing, but it is not the reason i am giving this an average rating. One of my key goals with the tour was riding a camel, and after the berber village, we stopped at some camels that we could ride. However, it was absolutely heartbreaking. The camels seemed thin and unwell, and for some reason i had to ride on a mother camel with a child. I kindly asked Adil to tell the \"camel guy\" to give me a different camel, but i don't think he understood what i meant. Having the poor child camel being dragged by a short rope was uncomfortable to me and seemed very cruel to the camel. My girlfriends camel was tied hard to the read of my saddle, in a very unnatural position, and her camel seemed scared and stressed. The camel ride which was supposed to be a fun highlight of the tour turned into a heartbreaking display of animal cruelty. We continued on to the Ourika valley waterfall in silence. The waterfall was a very nice experience. We got a local guide, Jamal (sorry if that's spelled wrong), who was really cool to trek with, and the trip went up rather nice mountain terrain. Unfortunately, the tour program did not mention that there would be technical challenges to the mountain trek (climbing, skipping from stones, etc.) so my girlfriend had brought along completely wrong shoes, but it worked out fine. The next day we did the Essouira trip. After about an hour we stopped at the most touristy cafe in the world in a small town. And then continued. Here along the road, Adil wanted to show us how argan oil is produced. The way they're illustrating this is by literally lifting goats up into trees, and having them stand there all day for tourists to see. I was just speechless. Poor poor animals. Looked long and hard at the other argan trees on the route, but none had goats climbing in them. Once we arrived in Essouira we were taken to a super-touristy fish restaurant, it was below average food, but pricy of course. Exactly what we would have gotten on a group tour. The program then specified we would get a guide in the city, but we never saw this guide. Instead we got to wander by ourselves in the city, which was actually a really nice experience. It was the highlight of the day, since it was a very beautiful and calm city. Sat down at a local cafe and enjoyed some tea, and then departed back. All in all, the big highlights of the trip made it worth it. Essouira city and the Ourika valley waterfall was beautiful and interesting, but the camel ride and goats in trees-stuff was terrible. Adil was an ok tour friend, but he didn't explain a lot or talk about our questions. Simple straight answers, and safe touristy choices. We're perfectly ok about touristy stuff, but don't say you're going to do a tour that skips it when you're going to do a tour that doesn't skip it. Also, for some reason he never bothered to learn our names. He kept calling my girlfriend Aisha and me Alibaba. It all felt a little mechanic and unpersonal."

I've been staying in Morocco for 3 weeks and my experience has been ok before this tour because I've mostly been visiting touristy places. Taking a tour with Rachid made me absolutely fall in love with this country and all it has to offer. Not only was Rachid the best guide I've ever had - the mountains, desert and everything we saw was completely breath-taking. The restaurants we were taken to were the best I've had in all of Morocco. He was beyond accommodating - making sure we always had water, always went to the best places, and even made sure I always had a vegetarian meal option. And doing Morocco in the summer means you must have air conditioning!! Rachid's car was so comfortable and definitely an oasis from the heat. He was professional, kind, and by the end of the trip you start to feel like you are traveling with good friends. Even after the trip was over, Rachid was so helpful getting me to my hotel and making sure everything was ok. You can tell he really puts his heart into what he does as he is so passionate about showing us the real Morocco, not the one you will ever see going out on your own. If you come to Morocco and don't take this tour you will be missing out on so much. This tour is probably one of the top 3 travel experiences I've had in my life."

A visit to a berber family, a trek through the atlas mountains, dinner by a river, a camel ride and a few other enjoyable stops. Having such a lovely talkative guide in Adil made the drive there very enjoyable. Absolutely lovely man who is perfect as a guide. We will be returning to Morocoo in a few years time, and the reason for that is to get a chance to go an a Sahara tour the next time with Adil. I already consider him a friend."

From the moment I got in touch with Adil to the moment I left Marrakech, Adil and Rachid looked after us as if we were family and ensured that our stay was worry free. We decided to do a drive through the Tizi n Tichka Pass/ Atlas Mountains and then visit Ait Ben Haddou. It was sublime and we were in awe of the overpowering mountains. In fact, my friend on the journey said it was one of the most peaceful experiences for him and vastly different to the resort holidays he usually goes to. We had some amazing food on the way and were introduced to some interesting shops, with both Adil and Rachid ensuring that we paid local rates. Adil also provided a very comfortable people carrier, which meant we had enough room for the journey.

Tell him the kind of experience you're looking for, and he'll make it happen. Looking for the best photos? He knows the places and the times of day. Looking for culture? He'll have you drinking tea in a tent in the desert one moment, and listening to music from from traditional Senegalese and Sudanese musicians the next. Looking for the best food? He knows the places, no matter what your budget. Want to avoid the tourists? Adil knows how. Want to see hidden sites the guidebooks don't mention? Adil knows where they are. His transportation is comfy, and off-road capable, with plenty of room for your gear, and he'll get you where you need to go. And the man can drive! With a breathtaking level of precision, he navigates roads and streets and alleyways that a normal driver would find impossibly daunting, but he's always willing to stop whenever you like to take a photo or even just stretch your legs. Adil himself is enthusiastic and wonderfully engaging and friendly. He also has a great sense of humor. You'll actually miss him when you go home. :)"

I originally reserved our trip to the Erg Chebbi dunes through a riad that booked it through another tour company which in turn passed our reservation on to Adil. Both myself and my husband couldn't have been happier to have had him as our guide to the desert.Adil showed up promptly at our riad in the morning and introduced himself, speaking impressively good English (as well as many other languages). His 4x4 was very comfortable and during our drive south he played many different types of Arabic language music for us, which we loved. He patiently answered all of our questions and went to much effort to ensure we had a wonderful time.Both of the hotels he booked us into were wonderful. Our room in Dades Gorge had a breathtaking view of the river and canyon and our hotel in Merzouga was right next to the dunes of Erg Chebbi, so we could wander out easily into the desert.Because Adil knew we were photographers, he made every effort to stop at beautiful places for us to photograph. We visited a large rock formation, a geyser on the side of the road, a restaurant serving Berber pizza, a group of African musicians, and many beautiful small villages with gorgeous architecture. Instead of taking us straight to the shops like some other tour guides did, he would always ask us first, \"Do you want to stop here?\" One night when we discovered some friends of ours were staying in Merzouga, he even stayed up late to take us to their kasbah and pick us up when we were finished meeting up. Once our tour had ended, Adil continued to check in with us to make sure we were enjoying ourselves. He even picked us up from the bus station free of charge to take us to our riad during the next part of our trip and also drove us to the airport on our last day.Our trip with Adil is something we will remember and cherish forever. We both consider Adil to be not just someone who is pleasant to do business with, but a friend as well. I would wholeheartedly recommend him to anyone looking to do this trip and would definitely use his services again in the future. Thank you kindly Adil, for going above and beyond. Saha!"

Me and my friend had a day trip to Ourika Valley with Adil, we had a great day out - this tour is the perfect amount of stops so that you can see ceramics being made, Argan oil and go to a Berber Village where you have a traditional Berber breakfast of bread, olive oil, butter and honey, which was delicious! The waterfalls were amazing and very refreshing after the heat of Marrakech! Adil provides a guide who will take you up to the waterfalls as it involves quite a bit of climbing. We ate our lunch afterwards in a restaurant where the tables are actually in the river, which was really fun and Adil joined us so we got to know him a bit better. This is a brilliant tour, Adil is unbelievably enthusiastic and will answer any question you have or help you do anything that you're interested in. There's a lot of choice in Marrakech so if you're looking for a great company, this is one!"

He spoke perfect English which allowed us to communicate with him easily. He was very friendly, helpful and very eager to attend to anything we might have wanted. Adil was very informative as well, he would give information on a particular location we may have been at the time. We travelled in a large four wheeled drive car that was very comfortable and clean which was certainly pleasant.We were picked up by our guide, Adil, from the airport and promptly taken to our riad where we were able to drop off our luggage before spending the day in Marrakech. Adil was there to guide us the entire day and was very helpful in helping us to see the highlights of the city during the day and the souks during the night.The following day we travelled through the Atlas mountains to Ouarzazate and eventually to Todra Gorge. We had plenty of opportunities to stop and take pictures. The mountains were breath taking and Todra Gorge was particularly stunning. We stayed the night at a hotel in Todra Gorge which was a small valley within the Atlas mountains. The hotel staff were very friendly, cheerful and welcoming.The next morning we set out for the Sahara desert and drove to a small town just on the edge before heading out on camel back to the campsite. We had set out in the evening so as not to feel the heat of the sun at midday. It was well into night by the time we had arrived at the campsite after having camel ridden for two hours. The scenery was something that cannot be forgotten. Riding through the desert on camel back with almost no other signs of life is an experience that was surreal. We had dinner at the campsite and admired the starry skies for the rest of the night until the next morning.We\u2019d woken up early the next day in order to climb a sand dune and witness a sunrise over a desert. We then left the Sahara before the midday heat started to affect us. Once we left the desert Adil driven us back to Marrakech which had taken most of the day.The following day we visited Essaouira, a fishing port on the western coast of Morocco. We spent time on its sandy beaches as well as walking through the city and fishing ports in order to see the main sights there. We later returned and spent the rest of the night at Marrakech before leaving for home the following morning.All in all it was a purely unforgettable experience. The sights that we had seen were beautiful and our guide, Adil was extremely helpful. We had a fantastic time in Morocco and this is a trip that we\u2019d all wholeheartedly recommend for anyone planning to visit the country! And off course we highly recommend Adil and his service. Adil raise the bar so much that you would forget you are in an unknown territory."

            "review": "Ourika Valley Day Trip. We are a couple from New Zealand, living in London and travelling to Marrakech for the first time. We had booked to stay in a riad in the centre of Marrakech so wanted to do a day trip into the Atlas Mountains and came across Moroccan Safaris on Trip Advisor - we ended up booking the Ourika Valley Day Trip. We were picked up by our guide Adil at 09:00 from our riad (noting that the riad is located about a 4 minute walk from the nearest car parking area through a maze of winding streets and alleys so it was so nice of him to come and collect us in person instead of meeting us at his car). Then we got into his 4x4 vehicle and set off on the drive. We stopped along the way to our destination in the Ourika Valley to take photos and Adil was very knowledgable and explained a lot about the history of Morocco. We stopped first at a local potter who showed us how they make their array of plates, bowls and tagines, then at a traditional Berber house for a tea ceremony and breakfast of bread, honey and olive oil, then to see how the women make Argan Oil and then finally at a local artists studio (a friend of Adil's) to see the sculptures that the artist makes. Adil was very clear that he was at our disposal and he encouraged us to ask him to stop at any time to take photos. When we arrived at our destination at the Ourika Valley Adil had arranged for a local guide to meet us and take us trekking up to the waterfalls. Luckily Adil had warned us to wear sensible walking shoes as the trekking was quite rocky and we saw a few people struggling in not-so-sensible shoes. On the way up the mountains we saw barbary monkeys and more craftsman selling rugs and other things. The waterfalls were incredible and it was a lovely cool break from the heat of Marrakech. After our trek we sat down at a restaurant on the river for a lovely lunch of tagine and couscous before Adil drove us back to our riad. We really can't recommend this tour enough - Adil was a wonderful guide and it was worth every penny. We hope to see him again and will be recommending him to friends and family :)"

Gotta be real: I didn't like the idea of taking a three-day private tour of the desert because, to me, I understood it as getting in a car with a stranger and being taken to the middle of the Sahara Desert...  But I did it and it was amazing! Adil picked us up from our Riad and took us on an amazing journey through the Atlas Mountains, gorges, and finally to the Sahara to ride camels to a campsite in the dunes where we were able to meet tons of other people. Actually, we were put in a camp with a group that came together and they were all very unhappy with their driver who was apparently \"mean\"; and they were upset that they didn't they had to pay to use the pool at the hotel nor were able to shower until their return to Marrakech 14 hours later- whereas we had a room to store our things, shower, and we didn't have to pay for the pool. The trip was safe and I never felt too isolated from people or places on the lonely roads that connect Marrakech to the Sahara. Adil organized tours, hotels, and meals to accomodate our trip. I'm under the impression that he works with a vast network of hoteliers and shop keepers- (assumably comprised of family and friends) with whom he is able to coordinate and which were all extremely friendly and accommodating! Adil took us to a rug maker in the mountains where we were able to get a Moroccan rug at a much better price than what we could have found in Marrakech. All in all it was an amazing trip and Adil is really able to work with you to make your trip memorable. If you're looking for a trusty excursion outside of the chaotic marketplace of Marrakech, then you should definitely look into this! Thanks Adil! Sorry about making you go out to the desert during Ramadan."

            "review": "Fantastic day trip to Ourika Valley and Berber Village. Myself and my girlfriend had a fantastic trip to the Ourika Valley and Berber village during our short time in Morocco. Our guide Adil picked us up at our hotel at exactly the time that we had arranged. Though Adil stated that English was not his 3rd language (as he speaks French, Arabic, Spanish, Italian), I honestly would have though he had learnt it formally.The drive to the mountains was aprox 1 hour and the 4x4 was comfortable and clean. Adil offered on several occasions to stop so that we could take photos. On one occasion I asked could we stop so that I could take a photo of a beautiful village on the spine of one of the mountains, while Adil was more than obliging he also informed us that we would receive attention from the locals who would want to sell us their products. This was helpful and considerate as sometimes this can be an intense experience.We were taken to a traditional Moroccan house where we met a lovely family who happily welcomed us into their home. Though the family were on Ramadan they still provided breakfast and tea for us. Both the woman who owned the house and Adil made us feel very at home and answered all of the questions that we had.After breakfast we were taken to a waterfall high in the Atlas Mountains. One small point I feel could have been empathised more strongly is that it is quite a trek (if you are not a particularly active person) to the waterfall, and so some may find it tough. Thankfully myself and my girlfriend are both quite fit and so had no issues. Adil left us in the hands of a local boy called Jamal who was as accommodating and friendly as Adil. At no point during this trek did we feel uncomfortable or rushed. Jamal's English was again superb and we found it very easy to communicate. The view from the waterfall is truly breathtaking, all the local tour guides were friendly and had a sense of humour. Jamal allowed myself and my girlfriend to spend as much time as we wanted by the waterfall and this even gave me a chance to go for a quick dip in the lagoon. Once we had descended we ate a lovely meal IN the river. The water is less than ankle high and is very refreshing given the 44+ degree heat.The entire day was absolutely perfect, and very reasonably priced (by European standards). While Adil was our guide (and a very good one at that) I feel by the time the day was out he was more like a friend. He is always helpful and obliging even in short notice. Adil even brought us to the airport on our departure day with less than 3 hours notice. He is truly a credit to the Moroccan people and to the company.I would highly reccommend this trip to anyone and everyone, and if it isnt clear by now Adil is your man."

Worried the trek might be physically exhausting for our child, Adil ensured he met our criteria in that we as adults also wanted adventure!and boy did we get it!We requested Adil to pick us up at 9.30am and he arrived 15mins early which was nice seeing we had some experience of 'moroccan timing'! We got to know him on the journey there and what was great was that he didnt do the commercial tourist stops to the shops/markets. Its true what the other reviewers have said about Adil. He is very caring about his community and is also respectful to everyone he meets along the way.His energy is super infectious and I would highly recommend his company for tours. I will definately be using his services again on my next trip to the Sahara!Atlas mountains are breathtaking, the trekk can be designed to suit your requirements esp with small children and its something everyone should experience!

This wasn't extreme biking because we had beginners in the group and they make sure they can cope. Would suggest you book a private group of you want something more adventurous. But it's still enjoyable riding across the desert and up and down the hills. The lake is really just the scenery at the end when you have tea and crepes. Definitely recommend"

The route chosen is not too challenging but has a mix of road, tick and sand. The stop in the Burber village is a welcome break I got the impression the house we visited was where the chap who led our party lived. Sitting in the shade drinking traditional tea and nibbling on a Moroccan freshly made flat bread was awesome. If you are going in the summer wear sleeves trust me is over 40 degrees and there is NO shade, don't wear shirts either as your legs will cook. Your left leg will cook from both the sun and the heat from the quads engine. Go in the morning it's just too hot to quad in the afternoon."

My other half and I booked our half-day trip at Lake Takerkoust with Maroc Quad Passion via Whatsapp, with them confirming pick up time for our half day trip the evening before departure. They collected us as the hotel on time and transported us to their base in the desert outside Marrakech in a very comfortable, air conditioned van.The trip itself was wonderful. After testing everyone's skills, they split the group of 12 into 3 groups of 4 riders. This was great as our group wasn't slowed down by some of the more nervous riders or kids, which can so often be the case. The quadding itself was amazing, at times like driving across the moon! The scenery was unbelievable, and there was opportunity to stop for photos (although there could have been more of these for the view of the lake). Nonetheless, a solid 2 hours of quadding at a reasonable price, and with great guides.There was a nice post-quad meal of moroccan pancakes and mint tea, though this was a little rushed. It was very pleasant though, and the view spectacular. There were a few attempts to sell some other trips, like jet-skiing and such, but a polite no was sufficient.I can't recommend this trip enough!"

We must have covered a lot of ground as we were on the ATVs for almost two hours, over some brilliant and very scenic terrain. Our guide was very good to point out the more risky areas along the way and warning us to slow down. At the end we stopped at a restaurant over looking the lake at our starting point and had pancakes and mint tea before being driven back to our riad.

This meant we were able to drive at our own speed and wasn't in a long train limiting us when on the trail. We stopped at the top of a mini mountain and were able to take pics and ride a donkey before taking off again on our journey. The track was very rocky terrain and we were driving for a long period of time . We stopped off again at what looked like a traditional Beber village to have some mint tea before heading back to our pick up point. After the ride we were air hosed to get all the dust off and dropped back to our Riad.Overall a great experience and I would recommend the only negative would be that they could've given us gloves as it was very chilly to begin with in the morning."

They accomodated our group size (8) and allowed younger members to ride along as a passenger. Get to drive through the country side and stop for mint tea after an hour of driving. Only criticisms would be that first impressions are not great...the website shows sand dunes and you get a gravelly, rocky bit of land with lots of rubbish. But this is only the practice area and you are soon on your way through the countryside. My only other point of contention is that once you get used to the driving its a bit boring. They don't allow you to speed up or kearn any fancy moves! The driving is flat road and a bit monotonous."

A 16 year old son who wants quad biking but a wife and daughter who only want to ride camels \u2013 not a problem for Maroc Quad Passion and after a couple of emails with Youssef we were all set. First it was pick-up from the hotel and a short drive to the quad centre. After a safety briefing and helmet fitting followed by some simple familiarising and steering we were off. There we only 8 in the group but we immediately split into two groups of 4 so there was no riding at the back of a long train. Our guide took us quite some distance but mainly on tracks and trails so we were never bothered by any road traffic and we felt safe and secure throughout. There was the opportunity of a couple of stops for some photos and a chat plus a visit to a rural homestead for the ubiquitous mint tea but also some delicious Moroccan pancakes. The two hours went so quick and we were soon being dusted off with an air hose before meeting up with my wife and daughter who\u2019d been separately collected from the hotel. It was then a brief drive to the palm grove to put on some more traditional head gear for the camel ride. No controls to learn this time but like our guide the camels were all very friendly and we spent a brilliant hour or so with a leisurely and surprisingly comfortable stroll in the sun. I can\u2019t recommend the whole experience highly enough and we\u2019ve been left with lots of great memories to recall and reminisce now we\u2019re back home plus my son wants to know when we can do the full 5-day quad safari!"

When you stop to have mint tea the people are so hospitable and friendly and give you endless amounts of bottled water and top up your tea glasses. You definitely get your money's worth as you're you on the quad bikes for over 3 hours and yet you do not get bored as the different landscapes and terrains are always exciting. Whether you're driving the quad bike yourself or on the back of the instructors it is just as exciting and this experience will create a memory of a lifetime! You can easily book and arrange timing with Youssef through whatsapp which is very convenient. Would recommend this to anyone!"

I have never written a review before but this was one of the best things my girlfriend and I did in Marrakech. 70 euros to share a quad (or 50 for your own) and we were picked up by Youssef from our Riad. We drove to the outskirts of Marrakech and had a good guide and basically went for an awesome 2 hour quad drive through the landscape. Some great picture opportunities and even stopped off for some Peppermint tea in a Berber village.Well worth the money and Youssef is a top bloke. If you are tight for time in Marrakech like we were or if you have lots of time, either way this is a must do activity."

Very punctual and precise with timing. The driver was also very friendly and made us feel comfortable and communicated with us throughout the journey. On arrival to the location, we were greeted by Youssef and the team in a very welcoming manner. We were given a quick and detailed introduction on how to use the quads and what activities will be covered through out the day. Very well spoken English therefore had no communication difficulties. The quad bikes worked efficiently and were very easy and safe to ride. The employees within Marrakech Quad Evasion were full of spirit and were excellent as guides as we had the opportunity to take pictures with the quads and have a drink break. Half way through the quad journey, we were taken to a beautiful village were drinks and traditional mint tea was provided. Youssef is a amazing, friendly man who is full of spirit and really nice to talk to. He is down to earth and his employees are 100% genuine and awesome people. Highly recommend Marrakech Quad Evasion and well worth the price. Would definantly book quad biking again with Youssef as our experience was very pleasant. Very professional and punctual company."

After getting kitted up and a quick intro to the quads, we headed of into the spectacular surrounds, passing farms and village along the way. Later on we headed back towards the city for an hours camel trek, before getting dropped off back at our hotel. The whole experience was very good and very smooth.

He's a kind and authentic dude that does this job because he loves to share his country with travelers. The trip is a well curated journey that never feels manufactured or exploitive. I think the routes change slightly from trip to trip, but the terrain is stunning and the stops are well considered for their historical/cultural impact. Said is also always on hand with interesting bits of Moroccan history, anecdotes, local folklore and advice. One of the best parts of the trip was listening to his stories. The company is very good at communicating pre-trip, in our case we were talking directly with Said from the get go. They were able to arrange pick-up, hooked us up with veggie meals wherever we went, and thoroughly answered all of our questions about the excursion. I've heard some of these tours can be manipulative in terms of their stops and hidden charges/route changes along the way, but there's not a shred of that going on with these guys. There's really just a strong sense that they want you to enjoy yourself and have as authentic an experience as possible. Can't recommend this company enough, by far the best part of our time in Morocco. Thanks again Said."

            "review": "A trip worth a thousand and one words. This was our first time visiting Morocco and we definitely made the right choice by choosing this tour. I picked this one specifically because I didn't want a tour company that had seen so many tourists that they start to not care about taking people around their country. Where it\u2019s more a money-making business, where you are part of a big group and you will not receive any sort of bespoke individual experience. We were so lucky to have Said as our tour guide as he was a genuine and nice person, who loves his country. From the very first email Said was extremely polite and helpful, more than any other tour company I'd spoken to. We ended up travelling with just him, my husband and me. We went from Marrakech to Ait Ben Haddou, to the Todras, Atlas Mountains, several Oasis and obviously to the Sahara desert. It was still a whistle stop tour as we only had 3 days but it was definitely the way to go. Having stayed in Marrakech for 2 days I was very much ready to leave the hustle and bustle (and generally being harassed at the souks) to explore what Morocco was really about. At Ait Ben Haddou, you can ask them to organise a tour for you if you want to hear about the history and get taken around. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s too expensive. We didn\u2019t because we weren\u2019t that fussed. But Said couldn\u2019t take us because only specific tour guides are allowed (stimulating the economy I guess!)Todras gorge was really lovely. There had been some rainfall so you could walk into some of the water. Really nice. It was quite busy though, but no more than the other big landmarks like Ait Ben Haddou. My favourite place was actually Skoura, one of the little Oasis on the first night. The place we stayed was run by a family business and you can really tell. It was remote, but stunning. Not at all touristy, and very authentic. The food was the best I\u2019d had in Morocco, just divine! Just as an aside, although I love tagines, you do want some change, so this was the one that stood out as it felt a little more authentic. Most of the food you\u2019ll get in Morocco (not just in the tour) is very similar \u2013 varying types of tagines, wraps or kebabs, with rice or salad. Not a huge amount of variety unless you really look for it. We loved Nomad in Marrakech, this restaurant has amazing food! The trip to the Sahara was amazing, albeit short. We set off on camel when the sun was quite low, maybe 6-7pm and then arrived at the camp by nightfall. We had dinner with a few other people on the tour, and the locals did a song and dance for half an hour or so. We then ventured out to the desert to see the stars, and although we went back to the camp around 1am, the moon was so bright you could have slept under it for sure. The temperature was perfect. However we had to leave at about 5am to catch the sunset, so thought we\u2019d better sleep in the bed. The camp was extremely clean and nice given it\u2019s in the middle of nowhere, so if you\u2019re a clean freak like me, you\u2019ll have no problems! There\u2019s good toilets and running water. You sleep in a type of metal room, which is probably ventilated but still quite warm. The beds aren\u2019t exactly comfy, quite hard really, but there\u2019s electricity and sheets, what else do you need!One thing to keep in mind if you do this tour, which they\u2019ll tell you anyway, is that it is a LOT of driving. The journey from the desert back to Marrakech was around 10 hours. And obviously getting there is the same distance but broken up, which is still hours in the car. I guess if you want to go all the way down to see these amazing places it\u2019s the only way. But if I had a choice it would have been nice if I had more time so we could spread out the drives. You can see more of my adventures and what I experienced from my pictures. All in all, what you see is what you get. The tour speaks for itself. You visit all the places on the itinerary and you\u2019re greeted with nice people and go to places that are really quite unique. On top of that, you\u2019ll be with a guide who knows a good deal about Morocco and will work hard to make sure you have a good time. We were even privileged enough to see Said\u2019s home, meet his family (they were very shy!) But an insight into how Moroccan people actually live? That is something you can\u2019t buy.Also want to point out that the value of this tour is by far the best compared to all the ones I looked at on Tripadvisor. Offers more and doesn\u2019t charge all this other random things like other companies do. One thing to keep in mind is that if you do meet people and speak to them for any service (like visiting a site and getting a brief history, or going to the toilet, or just at restaurants), generally they expect a tip. Same goes for places you eat at, just a good idea to keep change around. I would think about 10% each time, but it\u2019s at your discretion. Really enjoyed my time in Morocco, so thanks to Said and the team at Morocco Desert Trips for being so accommodating!"

My wife and I traveled to Morocco for the first time in September and decided to book a two-day private trip to the Zagora desert, as we were only staying for one week and only had limited time. Said informed us that larger tours move a bit more slowly and we would probably have more autonomy if it was only us. This trip was the absolute highlight of our entire week in Morocco. Said arranged our transportation, meals and site visits, but also engaged in very interesting conversations about the history, politics and future or Morocco while taking us off the beaten path to really experience the country.We drove through the high Atlas Mountains, stopping frequently for pictures, snacks and a bit of shopping. All of the locations he recommended were top-notch, and would have been difficult to find without him.We always felt safe, informed and engaged in the country and culture.Morocco Desert Trips took all of the guesswork out of the journey, and allowed me and my wife to relax and take in all the beautiful sites and experiences of Morocco. Said is a great guy who I feel fortunate to have met, and will definitely call up the next time we travel to the area.I only wish I had known more about what they offer before booking. These guys can pretty much tailor fit a package for you to fit your specific needs, so be sure to send them an email with what you are looking for and they can create something perfect.Said showed us a part of Morocco we never would have seen without him, and for that I am immensely grateful."

We didn't know what to expect but the itinerary was what we were after. As it turned out, we had no worries. It was worth every durham. Our driver Larbi was not only a capable and safe driver but had a great knowledge of Morocco and it's culture. Everything was organised through Said, who we had the pleasure of meeting in his family home during the trip. Said was very accommodating and did a great job organising our adventure into the Sahara. The accommodation was very good and the meals we had were some of the best food of our entire trip to Spain, Portugal and Morocco.We had the awesome experience of sleeping under the stars in the Berber camp in the Sahara and observing both the sunset and sunrise in the desert. Magical!Thank you to Said and Larbi for all your good work and hospitality.

In search for the best tour, we found the great reviews for this one so we contacted Morocco Desert Tours. Said was our person in contact and he offered us every detail about the itinerary, accommodations and everything we could ask for. We chose the 4 days - 3 nights desert tour option and although we found it a little pricey at the beginning, it toured out to be the best part of our vacation. It was worth all the money because the memories we did in our 4 days trip were the best ones that we\u2019ll remember looking back.We saw some breath-taking places, we stayed in wonderful riads, we experienced the desert and the real feeling of Mor\u200b\u200bocco as Said has chosen the very best for our trip.

He was on time to get us at our Riad. We traveled with another couple so we got the tour cheaper. We had the 3days, 2nights tour to the desert and we didn't regret it. Despite the long travel, there were lots of coffee/toilet/picture breaks. Said showed us picturesque views along the way, occasionally stopping for some photos. He was a very good driver too. On day 1, we saw some Berber villages along the way and visited 2 very old kasbahs, where some famous films were shot. We slept at a beautiful and quiet hotel (Dar Panorama-it's small but clean with a very nice view outside) in Skoura Oasis. On day 2, we passed by valley of the Rose and Dades Valley, with breathtaking views of a village with some greens. We arrived at another hotel where we freshened up/took a shower before heading to the desert. We had a camel ride to the desert and stayed overnight at a Berber tent where there was Berber music and some Moroccan food/tea. The bed was comfortable enough at the tent. There were toilets outside. Early the next day we headed back to the hotel again (via camel) for shower and breakfast. Then back to Marrakech via Draa valley and Atlas Mountains, again a very scenic ride. Said gave us lots of interesting informations about Morocco along the way. He gladly answered our questions and brought us to good but affordable resturants. At the end of the journey Said asked us on how they can improve their service. He patiently waited until the Riad owner picked the other couple and brought us to our own Riad. He even gave us his no. so that we can call him if there was any problem during our stay in Morocco. He is like a friend you can trust when in Morocco. I highly recommend this tour if you want to see Morocco in a different non-touristy way. It's worth all the money, time and energy\u00fc"

We went on a private 3 day tour - fully recommend the guide, Said as friendly, knowledgeable and does his utmost to unsure you have the fullest experience depending on your wishes. Really outstanding. Really nothing to comment on in a negative way at all, wish it had been longer. Fully recommend this tour if you wish to experience real, rural Morocco and see some of the most stunning landscapes. On top of the price I would recommend taking around 800 DH for lunches/tips and extra things you may wish to experience although not necassary for this much. Very glad we took this over a large group tour."

            "review": "Outstanding!!!. My daughter and I planned a week-long vacation in Morocco as part of our 3-week vacation overseas. My initial thought was to plan everything on my own (as I usually do) as this cuts down on costs and leaves us with the flexibility to do as we choose and to change plans on the fly. This has worked for us in the past and I figured that it would be ideal for Morocco.However, I did have worries about safety and security and with wanting to see more than the typical tourist sites. I corresponded with many different companies before settling on Morocco Desert Trips and in particular, Said. Said was always prompt and helpful in his replies. He was honest in his assessment of our proposed itinerary and made suggestions on how it could be more efficient. He even suggested possible ways to spend less money - I appreciated his honesty and feedback and this was ultimately why I chose him and his company.We basically spent our entire time in Morocco with him. I am skeptical by nature but our entire tour was absolutely amazing. He gained our trust almost immediately and there was never any concern about our safety or getting value out of our trip. He set up a fantastic itinerary that allowed us to visit the wonders of Fes, Marrakech, Chefchaouen, Skoura Oasis, Merzouga and camping in the desert. One thing to note with Said is that you are always in complete control of your itinerary. If you need to make revisions and slight changes on the fly, he is very accommodating. It sincerely is his goal to make you happy and to ensure that you are getting what you want out of the trip. As a result, we enjoyed an absolutely perfect week in Morocco. We got to see what we wanted to see and we never had a worry about our safety, our security and whether or not we got full value for our money. We travelled in comfort in his air-conditioned 4x4 and all of the accommodations that he booked for us was first-class. I was a little hesitant about having someone else book our accommodations without first doing some research of my own but we had absolutely no complaints. In fact, in doing some checking up after the fact, all of our accommodations were highly rated in TripAdvisor and all of the booking websites - these were places I would probably have booked on my own.I know that I am missing much, much more in this review but suffice to say, we were extremely happy with our trip and with our decision to go with Said and Morocco Desert Trips."

We booked the 3 days and 4 nights TRIP A with Mustapha via MoroccoDesertTrips.com .The first guide Said came at our hotel in Marrakech pick us up at the door. The 4x4 was great and had a wifi hotspot. We left and explored all the way to The Dad\u00e8s Gorges where we slept for one night in an Auberge/hotel. The next day we met our second and last guide Mustapha who brought us through Merzouga and the desert where we slept in a Berber camp. The next day we slept in the Nomad Palace which seems to be the only near \"hotel\" in the desert. For the last day we travelled to our final destination F\u00e8s.Overall this was a great experience, the guides are friendly and speak proper english/french/spanish/arabic (from what I've seen). Throughout the trip you visit several places where you can buy souvenirs however you are not harassed to do anything. Be prepared for a lot of traveling because it is far from main cities obviously but worth it in the comfortable 4x4. What's great about this trip is you can ask the driver to go where you want as it's a private tour. Mustapha was a very interesting guide we were with him for the most part he knows the place and was interesting to travel with. The one thing I would like to see improvement has nothing to do with the company it's about the Nomad palace which was partially in construction and offered minimal services.It was an excellent trip thanks to Morocco Desert Trips."

A totally unforgettable three days in the desert, in no small way because Mohamed Aghdaomi, our guide, went above and beyond to give us the most authentic tour possible. Riding camels out to camp overnight in the desert, trying a wide array of cuisine, seeing such a varied terrain, and hearing about the history of the Berber people were all highlights. If you want to see the Sahara, this is the way to do it. Thanks to Morocco Desert Trips and Mohamed for a great time!"

I can't recommend him enough! Said worked with me for weeks beforehand on some complicated logistical issues, and he made special arrangements to accommodate our dinner plans. Due to some last minute travel glitches on my end we had to depart for the excursion a bit later than we had originally planned, and Said was super accommodating the entire time. Of course the excursion was absolutely amazing. It was so authentic compared to other proposals we received, and it ended up being one of the most beautiful parts of our trip. (Our quote was also extremely fair and reasonable compared to others for much lesser quality excursions.) My friends are still raving the experience, which is hard to even put into words. We rode camels and enjoyed traditionally-prepared tea at sunset in the middle of a stone desert with no one around for miles. It felt surreal. And they brought a few baby camels who were \"learning\" which obviously was one of the most adorable things imagineable! Don't hesitate to book with Said. He's a true professional (along with the other guides who accompanied us) who genuinely cared about making our experience amazing. He succeeded 100%! I had high hopes for this at the outset due to all of the positive reviews, and it turned out better than I imagined. Thank you, Said!"

It happens sometimes that a particular phrase, which you would hear from a complete stranger without any obvious reason would stuck in your head and would stay there as a tantrum for a long time. This is what has happened to us in the very first hour of arrival to Morocco. A lady - owner of the small hotel in Marrakesh (I understood she migrated herself to Morocco many years ago from France) told us that Morocco is like a Closed Castle (Kasbah) with quite reserved culture and traditions; and if you are lucky enough to open the doors of this Kasbah you would understand the Sole and Heart of Morocco; however if you won't succeed in doing so - you would be just wasting your time there. We've had an unbelievably wonderful trip with my wife starting with the city tour in Marrakesh, 3 day desert trip to Merzouga, and returning back to Casablanca; and for the whole journey from the very moment our plane landed in Marrakesh and till the time it took off in Casablanca, we were accompanied by Said, from Morocco Desert Trip, who helped us to break the spell and to \"open the doors of this Castle\"; not to say that the majority of stigma we had as those people who previously experienced Africa only through the National Geographic Channel eventually disappeared. Great thanks to Said and Abdul (our driver) whose help with we succeeded to open up the True Moroccan Oasis, which initially we were erroneously looking for somewhere around Scoura or in many other similarly beautiful places; we are really happy that finally we found this oasis within the hearts of simple Moroccan people..."

Said was very quick to answer all our questions about the trip before hand and we knew straight away from his swift and detailed responses that we had picked the right company.We were picked up from our Riad in Marrakech by our driver Larbi. Larbi was very friendly, forthcoming, great english and even let us put our own music on in the car. He was also a very safe driver and we felt completely at ease with him on the road. Throughout our drive Larbi would pull over so we could take pictures at various points of the amazing scenery that was encountered along the journey. Due to adverse weather conditions we were not able to take the regular route and had to to go via Midelt in order to get to the Sahara. Larbi made sure that the longer journey was broken up as much as could be and we stopped at some great places for lunch! Once we had arrived at the Sahara it was an experience that we will never forget, the camel ride to the camp is a great experience and the staff are very funny and friendly. The food at the camp was lovely and staff did there best to talk to all guests and get people involved when it came to the traditional music! Waking up to see the sunrise on top of the dunes is something definitely worth waking up for.The drive back to Marrakech was again a long one but Larbi stopped at several interesting places on the way to make the journey fly by.Overall an amazing trip and made possible by Said and his team at Morocco desert trips. If looking to book any trip or tour in Morocco then Said and his team should be the only people you use!ThanksArchie and Gina"

A trip to the Sahara is the ultimate Moroccan experience and my three day tour to Erg Chebbi with Said as our guide did not disappoint. From the very first email he was attentive and helpful. He is a wonderful, warm person and one of the things that impressed me immediately was how proud he was of his country. He is educated, speaks excellent English and is very knowledgeable in just about every subject connected to Morocco, including painstakingly trying to explain the Western Sahara to me. On a lighter note we greatly enjoyed hearing about Moroccan wedding customs, Berber history, including their alphabet and even visiting (from afar) what will eventually be one of the largest solar power stations in the world. We also appreciated the beautiful roses he bought for us in the valley of the roses. Just one of the little personal touches that made this tour special. The drive over the Atlas Mountains was breathtaking, and our two excursions into the exotic Ait Benhaddou and Taourirt Kazbahs were very educational. Everything on our tour was well organized down to the last detail and included a wonderful meal organized at the last minute with a local Berber family, who served us the best couscous in Morocco (recipe appreciated)."

Said was wonderful: our conversations touched on everything from politics to wedding customs to the history of the Berber alphabet. About five minutes after he left us in Marrakech we were already talking about how we missed him, and all of us want to come back and take a longer tour next time! The restaurants, the hotel, and the desert camp were all fantastic - we were never in places with more than four or five other tourists, and each one was interesting in its own right (for example, the hotel we stayed at had spectacular panoramic views so that we could drink tea and watch the sunset; one of the restaurants was a village cooperative serving camel tagine). One of our favourite experiences came on the final day when, since we'd been talking about our interest in Moroccan cooking, Said arranged for us to have a home-cooked meal with a local family. The food was delicious and we all felt genuinely welcomed. I'd expected a booked tour, even an excellent one, to feel 'touristy', but Said made everything feel like a road trip with friends. I can't recommend this trip highly enough!"

After browsing through different web pages of companies that organize different tours, I came across \"Morocco Desert Trips\". After reading through the reviews on Trip Advisor I thought to give it a go and write an e-mail to Said asking about different tours and hopefully receiving some important information about how to make our stay memorable.I didn't had to wait long and I already received my first mail from Said. After that I think we exchanged a few dozen mails because of the the \"few\" questions I had. For every mail that I wrote I received a response very quickly. It did not take to long before I decided that Moroccan Desert Trips would be ideal for us. So here it goes:We booked the following tours with Said:Two day, one night desert tourHalf day Marrakech tourTransfer from Marrakech to CasablancaAs you can see we pretty much relied on Said almost our whole stay in Morocco and I have to say that it was the best thing we could do!First we started with the half day tour in Marrakech. In the morning a man named Kamal came to pick us up. I did not know then that Kamal was one of the best drivers we ever had on our tours. Simply put he was friendly, forthcoming, patient with a great English and a good sense of humor. He was also our personal Dj and put on some nice tunes for the road!! I want to add that he is also a professional driver and we were never afraid with him on the road.We have seen many things in half a day but the tour was not rushed at all. After having one day off we started the 2 day desert tour. Fortunately we had again Kamal as our driver. We already knew from the start that it will be great. In the meantime I was always in contact with Said through e-mail so if we had any questions he was also there for us.After a few hours into the tour we had a nice surprise of meeting Said as he was also driving another couple who booked the same tour. After that almost every time we had our break we got the chance to sit down and have a talk. Said is a great person, very friendly and helpful so it was a great pleasure to also meet him in person.Of course, the two day tour went great and we had absolutely nothing to complain about!We can say that having booked the two tours and the transfer with Said, we could not be happier about the professional service we received!All in one I have to say that I would encourage everybody traveling to Morocco who is searching for a trustworthy and professional company to contact Said. After the first mail you will most probably feel at ease and book a tour with him!! ;)Thank you Said and Kamal for the great and unforgettable Moroccan experience you gave us!!!!Regards,Ervin"

Based on reviews we chose to contact Said and \"Morocco Desert Trips\" for this purpose. Now after going with Kamal, our driver, to this trip I consider that the reviews don't do them justice. The trip was perfect; Not amazing, not good or other attributes - it was simply perfect. Said was very easy to talk to and very friendly. After he arranged the tour he also suggested a half day tour in Marrakech which we also accepted and also helped us with the transfer from Marrakech to Casablanca. Lets go on to the half day tour:Our driver, Kamal, found our address, picked us up without delay and showed us what was most important in Marrakech. Although unplanned he gladly gave us some time to have breakfast, took us to the best spices shop and much much more. When we asked where we could find a supermarket to buy water and some beers we thought he would show us the place on the map - we could not have been more wrong. He drove us there, waited until we finished buying things and helped us carry them!Not to mention the fact that Kamal had to pick us up at 8:30 am for the desert trip but we arranged with him to start at 7:30am in order for us to get \"a breakfast with a view\"Now, for the fun part:2 days later after we met Kamal, he again picked us up and we started our journey to the desert. As promised he drove us to a place to have breakfast which was at least breath taking. You would expect to pay at least 50% more for food when you book a tour because of the deals that the guides have with restaurants right? Well WRONG! Amazing food, amazing coffee and breathtaking view at a decent price - even low compared to other places. During the whole trip Kamal answered our questions, told us facts about everything in Morocco, was our personal DJ and drove at his best because one of us was car sick. I'm not going to go on about the views and landscapes because it would be to much but I am going to say this: Kamal managed to keep us on track time wise whilst stopping at every beautiful thing so we can take some photos and learn something new. The desert itself was beautiful, the camp and people there very nice, the food and tea were awesome and the music was authentic. After our night there, Kamal gave us the bad news: because of the rain, a bridge in the Atlas mountains (our only way back) collapsed. That meant we had to go to Agadir first and then to Marrakech to literally go around the mountains. The way back was awesome. We saw new places, ate BBQ goat and beef and had the most amazing time!I can go on and on about this trip but I don't want to spoil it for you.To sum it up I will say this:1. It was easy to organise and very fun to take part of2. Kamal and Said are amazing people3. Our trip wouldn't have been the same without themIf you decide to visit Morocco I most definitely encourage you to contact Morocco Desert Trips for the perfect holiday!"

As others have mentioned the communication was clear and efficient. Kamal was our guide and was very helpful, knowledgeable and kind, especially given that I was unwell during most of the trip (travel sickness on the first day crossing the Atlas and upset stomach for the remainder of the trip). It was great to see such diverse, beautiful landscapes and get to know Morocco better. Also we enjoyed lots of the shops we stopped at (such as in the Valley of Roses where we bought rose cosmetics and in Merzouga where we bought scarves and spices). We were lucky to experience a snow storm on the return journey to Marrakech which completely transformed the landscapes and gave us a different view of the Tichka and the Atlas mountains.Unfortunately there were a few issues with some of the trip:-The restaurant we visited on the first day for lunch (L\u2019Oasis D\u2019Or in Ait Ben Haddou) was a total tourist trap-poor quality, overpriced food, very limited menu and terrible service. We were not given a choice about where to eat and I think that people doing the tour should be given the option to choose where to eat. The restaurant we had lunch at on the last day (Cafe Almanadir) was also distinctly average, at best. -Before visiting the desert we were brought to a shop to buy scarves for the desert to protect us from the sand. It's not a big deal but this was a separate expense that should maybe be mentioned when booking.-The desert was, overall, a disappointing experience. Firstly the guide who took us into the desert on the camels spent almost the entire 1 hour trip on his mobile phone. He completely ignored us and we got a very bad vibe from him overall. The camp itself was a disappointment also, mainly because there was no music provided (as described on the website- \"amazing Berber music show\"). When we mentioned this to Said he told us that we should have requested this ourselves in the camp- this was never mentioned to us by Kamal or Said at any point so it is an unacceptable excuse. We were really very disappointed about this. -The guide spoke to us only after the 1 hour trip back to the hotel the next day when he stopped us before getting there, made us get off the camels and proceeded to try to sell us some (vastly overpriced) soap dishes/other handicrafts. At the hotel where we had to shower in the morning after the desert unfortunately the showers available in the little outhouse were not working- one was completely broken and the other had only scalding hot water so we had to travel 650km back to Marrakech without showering.Despite the above there were also some highlights such as the Dar Panorama hotel in Skoura which was very calm, clean, friendly and welcoming. The food for dinner there was also very good. The restaurant where we had lunch in Erfoud (Cafe-Restaurant des Dunes) was great- surprisingly tasty food with reasonable prices. Overall we enjoyed the trip but would recommend that certain aspects be revised, especially the restaurants visited and the camp/guides used."

This trip was so fun and well organized, we decided to book a second tour with Said, a day trip to Essaouira. The drive to the coast and back and comfortable, safe, and fast. Throughout both trips, it became clear how well connected Said was throughout the region. His influence helped make both trips even more meaningful. Thanks for an amazing introduction to Morocco!"

I was not ready for the Atlas mountains, the insanely beautiful historical villages, Oasises, a night under the stars, with a camp fire, camel rides and astonishing nature... It was a fairy tale! Our guide was friendly, caring and frankly lots of fun! Totally recommend it!"

We also booked a afternoon trip into Agafay Desert which included a camel ride!He arranged everything just perfect. It was so romantic and we would love to go back to do a tour for more days.Overall we loved spending time with Said, it felt more like having a friend then having a tour guide, he give us his personal number on our first day and told us if we ever needed any help to just let him know -- how lovely!! When we eventually return to Marrakech Said and his company will be our first call!"

The Sahara trip is one of the most important reason for us decide to go to Morocco. I have been asked around 5 companies, with different reasons I was not satisfied, then I found Said through Trip Adviser. Because the reviews about him and this company was really good, so I sent Said an email, we started contact, Said was not just friendly with patient. But mostly importantly he gives very good suggestions also options which not in the point of view as businessman but friend. I have never been to Morocco so had lots of questions, I believe before we arrival Marrakesh, he have replied me at least ten emails with all my necessary and unnecessary questions.The day we arrival Marrakesh, Said came with us for a half day City Tour, he was very on time, and we did enjoy Marrakesh so much even the time was limited, but he really tried to let us have the most of it. Also he explained us the whole plan for the following day Sahara trip. The Sahara trip started really nice, because one of our friend normally have car sick, we thought with mountain way will be really difficult for her, but Said\u2019s driving skill was really good, so my friend was absolutely fine for the driving trip. Everything for Sahara trip was perfect, we reached on time for sunset, was beautiful , we have been treat really nice, and enjoy the night spent in Sahara. And we will definitely go back join a longer trip with Said. And will recommend said to anyone we know if they plan to go to Morocco!!!!!!!"

To make the most of our trip to Morrocco, my partner and I organised a private tour for 4 days/3 nights to Merzouga from Marrakesh. Said was our point of contact with the company and he was fantastic right from the start. He was quick to respond to my many emails and even gave advise on how to organise the tour to minimise my travel sickness! On the first day, Said met us at our Riad on time and took our luggage to his well-maintained 4x4. Although each day's travels were long, Said catered to our every need, be that rest stops, photography opportunities or simply answer our questions on the area. The tour was well managed in terms of time and every night we stayed in beautiful accommodation and served hearty traditional food. I have taken many tour in multiple countries. For us, what made this special was the personal touches. Said really listens to your interests. As we passed by his family home, we stopped in to have tea with his mother and see how rural Moroccans live. After I showed an interest in their farming, he arranged a friend of his to guide us around the fruit groves and small holdings. Best of all, after discovering I had arranged the night's stay in the dessert to fall on my birthday. He traveled through the dessert in the dark to surprise me with a birthday cake! That really was a fantastic night, celebrating in the tranquil dessert with friendly strangers, dancing to traditional music.For all of this, he expected no more than the originally agreed, very reasonable price. Said really does believe in delivering exceptional service.Throughout the trip we felt safe and achieved everything we had set out to do and more. I would definitely recommend this company, and Said, to fellow travelers."

            "review": "Once in a lifetime desert trip. My boyfriend and I took our first trip to Morocco for seven days and wanted to have a desert experience. We emailed MDT and they got back to us straight away with recommendations and options to suit. We chose to go to Zagora for a two day, one night trip with a camel trek to the edge of the desert and overnight stay in a Berber camp. From the outset the guide was extremely friendly and professional, advising us of exactly what to expect all the way. He was an excellent and safe driver, had a modern 4x4 (it was just the two of us and him on the trip), which I was relieved about as the drive over the Atlas Mountains is very windy. While the trip to Zagora and back is a long drive (8 hours each way), we didn't notice it so much as the guide had so much knowledge about the region and culture to share. He also stopped for photos and coffee, and lunch. We were very lucky to be taken to his house to meet his family on the way home. To see inside a local family's home was a real treat. We're very grateful. But most of all, the guide was very punctual as we needed to be at Zagora by a certain time to make the camel trek to the desert before sunset. The timing was perfect. He left us with a Berber guide who led us for just over an hour to a desert Berber camp. The sun was setting as we made the trek and it was magical. Other people doing a similar tour arrived to the camp late and had to make the trek when it was dark which wouldn't have been a great experience. At the camp we had a private tent, lots of blankets, our Berber hosts were very friendly (we weren't sure what to expect), they speak 3-4 languages. They cooked us a wonderful turkey tagine, we drunk tea (whiskey of the desert) and sat around the campfire beating drums. The sleep in the desert was strangely quiet except for the moaning of the camels! The camels are all beautiful, well looked after and the Berber people clearly have great respect for their animals. For sunrise we made the trek back out to meet our guide and stopped at various places on our way back. We got back to Marrakech about 7pm. It was a long day driving, but worth it. Because of all the knowledge of our guide, we felt much more able to understand Moroccan customs for the rest of our trip - tricks of the trade etc. Tips: tip the Berber guides at the camp, try to learn some Berber/Arabic, don't give money to the Berber children when your guide drops you off, get to Zagora before sunset, take warm clothes."

Said was very helpful and accommodating and helped to arrange the trip for us at the last minute via email.Said collected us from our Riad and we were driven in his 4x4 to Agafay. We then went on a camel ride across what are like sand dunes and the view is amazing! There is nothing for miles and it's so peaceful and serene. I was a bit worried that the camels would be tired (carrying us for a whole hour) and at one point mine starting to veer off in the wrong direction when he saw the hill he was going to have to climb! But the man who owns them and guided them across the sand dunes with us was kind to them and I think they are well cared for, so it put my mind at rest.We then arrived at a spot at the top of a 'sand dune', where Said and his colleague had set up an area for us to watch the sunset with Saffron Tea and Dates. It was beautiful!We relaxed for a while and then drove back. I had asked Said if we could see the stars and he did try and stop at a spot for us to view them, but unfortunately the moon was too bright at the time. We then asked if he could drive us past the New Town (newer part of Marrakesh) and he drove us there on the way back to our Riad so we could see the shops and Casino etc. Very helpful and accommodating!We are now considering going on a tour with Said to the Sahara in the future.The trip is a little expensive compared to some offers but it is worth it as the experience is private and a lot of effort is put in by Said to make sure you are comfortable and happy."

First of, Said was very efficient in getting back on my emails and ensuring the booking was made with all the correct details. We were taken on the tour by Kamal, who is an absolutely lovely guy with very good knowledge of the county and great driving skills. He took us through the Atlas mountains and into the desert, all the while being open to anwering any questions we had and stopping for photos. We were taken to nice restaurants for lunch on the way, and the oasis we spent the first night at was absolutely charming, with Ahmed (the host at the oasis accommodation) being one of the nicest people we met on the tour. The dinner that night was superb, to say the least. The next day was the camel trek into the desert, with the night spent at the camp in Merzouga, the views of the sand dunes were wonderful. The Berbers who were hosts at the camp were very friendly and cooked us a lovely tagine for dinner.We did not know what to expect when we booked the tour, but I will say that we were not disappointed. Would recommend Said's company 100% for anyone looking to book a tour/excursion.. It's a great way to see the countryside and get a taste of the desert. Our guide Kamal looked after us until the last possible moment when he dropped us off to our riad in Marrakech at the end of the trip - a huge thanks to him. I will say that it's not cheap, but it's definitely worth every penny for the overall quality if you're looking to do a tour like this.We look forward to coming back to Morocco!"

My husband and I were up at sunrise on January 1st to drive through the Atlas Mountains; by lunchtime, we were enjoying a terrific feast with a mind-blowing overlook of the desert oasis; a few hours later, we were riding camels through the desert witnessing one of the most incredible sunsets I've ever seen in my life to the Berber camp where we would spend the night. We spent the first night of the new year huddled around a fire staring at the most incredible expanse of stars we have ever seen in our city-dwelling lives -- an absolutely unforgettable moment. The Berbers we met were so friendly, funny, and charming -- as were the other tourists staying at the camp with us. We made genuine new friends for life. For all of this, we are incredibly grateful to Said. We booked an overnight tour of the Zagora with Said after our previous booking fell through -- and I couldn't be more pleased that we ended up with Said. Our tour with Said was cheaper and included more than the previous tour had. Said was extremely quick in responding to my inquiries. Our driver Kamal was so friendly, helpful, informative, and cheerful -- not to mention an absolutely top-notch, fantastic driver! We had such a terrific and enjoyable experience with him. Said's trips are 1,000% worth the money, and I would recommend Said without hesitation. We have not a single complaint, just extreme enthusiasm for our wonderful experience. We left Morocco incredibly eager to come back and explore more of the country, and we will undoubtedly use Said's company for all our future adventures. If you're on the fence about companies, choose this one for an absolutely incredible, unforgettable, remarkable experience!"

We wanted to do 2 day desert trip and our time in Morocco was limited, and Said was very honest about how far into the desert we would get within 2 days, leading us to decide perhaps a mountain day trip would work better for our schedule. His honesty and dedication to giving us the best tailor made experience for our time was very impressive and the reason I chose to tour with them. The day trip was seamlessly organised and tailored to us, Said arrived perfectly on time as promised, despite our riad being new and difficult to find. His knowledge of marrakech and Morocco is vast and his english incredible. e learnt so much from this philosophy graduate about his country that he is so passionate about, it was incredible to learn from him, one of the highlights of our tour. We drove to three different valleys in the Atlas mountains during the tour, visiting a berber house, argan oil producer (at my request), a small farmers market and the Ourika valley waterfall. We stopped off for photos whenever we liked, despite being grey and overcast with a forecast of rain and storms, the views were spectacular and the smell of pine and fresh apples will stay with me forever. Though sometimes I am nervous passenger in steep mountain roads, Said is an excellent driver and his car so comfortable and well maintained that I never felt anxious once. Even though it was a long drive with lots of ground to cover in one day, the stops were frequent enough that it never felt too much, and we had a great walk up the waterfall in the middle of the day, perfect to build an appetite for lunch. Said has gotten these tours down to a fine art and was always charming, patient and ready to answer any question we had. I would not hesitate to book another tour when I return ext time and look forward to learning more from this well educated, passionate tour guide. Many thanks again Said!"

Morocco Desert Tours is well-run and a great value. Based on tripadvisor reviews we booked a three day private desert tour from Morocco not really knowing what to expect. From the start Said was quick to respond and lay out our options. He met with us at our riad in Marrekech prior to our tour to go through the agenda, to answer any last minute questions and to collect payment for the tour. He has a number of drivers that he uses. Our tour guide was Larbi. Larbi is a nice, friendly, chill, professional man who speaks great English (as well as many other languages). He picked us up at our riad and drove us over the Atlas Mountains to Ait Ben Haddou and then on to Skoura - stopping at various places along the way for pictures and lunch and other interesting places and kasbahs. The valley on the southern side of the High Atlas is a magical desert dotted with beautiful oases. Skoura is the best thing ever. The next day we headed to Erg Chebbi, stopping at the Todra Gorge and other interesting sights along the way. In Erg Chebbi we road camels for an hour across the dunes of the Sahara and then camped under the stars in a comfortable tent with a mattress. On the final day we trekked back to town and then drove through a savannah landscape back to our riad in Marrekech. Larbi was a great guide. He was very flexible and happy to make any stops that we liked. All of our accommodations were arranged by the company, including breakfasts and dinner and were included in our fee. Fees for admission to points of interest and lunch during the day were additional (though not expensive) so bring some cash (Larbi pulled over for us to get some more cash from an ATM at one point). All in all I give MDT 5 stars and recommend then without any reservation. They are flexible and can customize the tours to fit your preferences/schedule. Thank you Said and Larbi!"

He went out of his way to make that happen for my daughter and I. Said's customer service is outstanding. The actual desert trek we did was three days; we were met right on time on the first day of the tour at our Riad by Larabi - he was very professional, quiet, but helpful whenever we needed it. He answered all our questions and was very good at making sure we knew what the plan was for each day, and where and when we would be stopping etc. The Riad they chose for us to stay at the night before we headed into the desert was lovely and very welcoming. Our guide, Omar, who took us on camels, into the Desert for the night was fantastic - he made that part of the trip really enjoyable.

As well as airport transfers, which were fantastic, we did two tours with Morocco Desert Trips. The first trip was the 3 day 2 night tour to Merzouga (the Sahara). We really enjoyed the two day drive to the desert which included driving through the Atlas Mountains, Berber Villages and visiting the Ait Bed Hadou Kaspah amongst other sites. Our driver Mohamed was great and stopped for photo opportunities and was able to tell us lots about Berber life in the villages. The B&B we stayed in on the first night was a real treat, it was very traditional and the hosts were extremely welcoming - highly recommend it! I became quite ill with a dodgy stomach and after several emergency stops in less than an hour Mohamed was very good and brought me to a pharmacy, translated for me and seen to it that I remained hydrated. He insisted I ate only rice for my meals that day and this was just what i needed, I could not thank Mohamed enough for the amazing care he showed me. The camel ride to the desert was a real experience and a must; prepare yourself for a sore bum! The desert is something that everyone should see and experience. We saw the stars before it got too cloudy but unfortunately we could not watch the sunset as it was still cloudy in the morning; this did not stop us climbing a massive sand dune and running around in the dunes at 6.30am in the morning. The nomad camp we stayed in was a little disappointing as we were the only people at the camp and it was really lacking in atmosphere. The trip is sold with dinner, traditional music and dancing which was not what we got at our camp. We had dinner which was wonderful and then we were walked over to a neighbouring camp for 20 minutes for the music and dancing. This was nice but we did feel very left out as this camp was full to bursting everyone had gotten to know each other there so we felt very much like we were tagging on. This definitely had a negative impact on our desert trip and I would recommend you ask Said to book you into a bust camp if you are going. There is not much to do in the desert without the music and dancing! The final day travelling back to Marrakech is a long days driving (around 10 hours) but these are the sacrifices you have to make.Do also note that there are charges for tours/entry at all the stops along the way to the desert. This came as a shock to us as there was not prior mention of it. be careful not to overpay as some tour guides certainly took advantage of us.We also went on a one day trip to Essaouira with this company. Our driver Larbi was EXCELLENT! His English was fantastic and he taught us lots about the various places we passed on the way to the coast! Essaouira has a beautiful fishing port, beach and medina and is definitely worth a day trip. While there you must go to the fish market and have your fish grilled for you while you wait....I have never tasted fish with such flavour!!These tours are fantastic, they are really well organised and the drivers always come on time. Morocco Desert Trips is a professionally run company and goes over and above for it's clients. I highly recommend them."

On the day of the Atlas Mountains tour we got to see all the lovely views of the mountains, he also took us for our 1st taster of a mini souk, We then visited the Argan oil centre where we got to learn about Argan oil and many other plants we also got to buy some goodies there also Abdul there is very lovely, After this we had lunch in a lovely restaurant and after this we were taken up the mountain but Mohammed. It was hard but it was the best feeling once you reached to the top. The view is amazing and Mohammed really looked after us. We also got to buy things from the berber people up in the mountains. We were late coming back and our tour over- ran but Said was so lovely and never rushed us. A few days later we had a tour of Marrakech it was a lovely day out we got to see loads and it was amazing. We cannot wait to return and do a desert tour with Said .. he is the best tour guide and we are so glad to have met him and made a friend."

We booked an all day tour to the Atlas Mountain as well as the Half-Day tour in Marrakech. In short, touring with this company was a wonderful experience! I communicated with Said via email prior to the trip (about 3 months in advance) to arrange the tour and iron out any details. Said was very responsive and helpful through email and described what we should expect, where we would visit, as well as any pricing for the tours. No monetary transactions were done online and everything was taken care of in person when meeting with our guide. Upon our arrival we communicated with Said and met with our great guide, Larbi! Larbi's English is great, my family and I felt very safe with his driving, and he was extremely attentive throughout the tours. When visiting the Atlas mountains it was clear that he knew the area well and was able to show us beautiful locations for photo opportunities! For lunch he took us atop a mountain with the help of a local guide onto the home of a Berber family who welcomed us with a delicious home-made meal, which we enjoyed with an amazing view. It was truly an unforgettable experience for the 5 of us!The next day, during our Marrakech day tour, Larbi met with us at our Riad once again to begin our private-vehicle (similar to Atlas mountains) tour of the city. It was another fun-filled day with Larbi as he showed us the Bahia and Badii Palaces, Medina wall, short tour of the new city, and Majorel Garden (breathtaking!). We also visited the Palmerie, and had the opportunity of dressing up in traditional clothing to have a half an hour camel ride around the Palmerie. Larbi clearly had great relationships with all the local guides who helped us, and we received excellent service wherever we visited. Both nights for dinner, Larbi made reservations to excellent, prestigious restaurants, where the food was absolutely fresh and delectable. We truly got a taste of the traditional Moroccan cuisine, thanks to this tour! Our 2nd day of the tour, we asked Larbi if he would recommend a restaurant where we'd experience a belly-dancing show, and not surprisingly, he did not disappoint! The tours with the help of Said and Larbi, was by far one of the best experiences we had during our 10 day trip around Morocco. Said and Larbi, thank you for making us feel welcome from the very beginning. We truly appreciate all your attentiveness, friendliness, and knowledge during our tours. It wouldn't have been the same without your help--you made this trip very worthwhile and if given the chance, we would definitely choose your company again! Forever grateful!! Cheers from New York!"

There were four of us, (me, my wife and our two sons 11 and 13). We took the 4 day 3 night tour and Larbi was our chauffeur/guide. Larbi had very good English, was very interactive with our boys (and especially helpful when our youngest fell after lunch one day and had glass stuck in his arm), was responsive to all of our questions and seemed to enjoy his job.Probably the best part of the trip was the locations they picked for us to stay\u2026.some very out of the way, interesting places with excellent views and to a person the places they chose were staffed by happy, friendly people. They clearly have very strong relationships that they have built up over time with the local vendors. Some of the roads Larbi took to get us where we wanted to go would never be found by a tourist driving on his own (but absolutely safe). His local knowledge and rapport with everyone provided us with an \u201cin\u201d everywhere we went.Our time overnight in the desert is one our family will remember forever; this is a must do. These four days showed us more of Morocco than we could ever see on our own. The enjoyment, sights and value for money were excellent. I highly recommend them."

Then on the next day we went to the dessert not too far from here, we got to climb a mountain and see the most breathtaking views, then we drove in the 4x4 to another spot in the dessert to watch the sunset, Said and his two colleagues brought cookies and made tea for us while we watched the amazing sunset in the dessert.

Said took our rather large group in two 4x4's on an adventure into the Agafay Desert the eve before Ramadam started... The journey itself was an adventure zooming through the desert up and down at times rather hairy inclines/declines, but at no time did we feel unsafe at all, or in any danger, it was fun. We stopped off on the journey for some of the party to climb this rather step hill where breathtaking views were to be had.. A couple of men came by on their donkeys, on the way to their very remote hamlet in the middle of the Agafay Desert. We then arrived at a flat plateau where carpets were laid out, a fire built and moroccan tea brewed, lovely morrocan nibbles and cakes were served while we watched the most magical sunset in the peaceful silent desert. Wow!!! Said is the best guide, so natural and comfortable doing his job, he felt like part of our family. Can't recommend him and his tours enough."

Driving over the rough terrain was so much fun. And on arrival to the ideal spot to watch the sunset, Said, Larbi and Abdul set up a seating area and built a small fire. they provided us with delicious snacks and fresh saffron tea. It's most certainly an experience none of us will forget. We all had plenty of laughs, including the guides who kept interaction throughout the trip.

As a family party of 10 we opted for a day trip to the Ourika Valley and were so pleased that we chose Morocco Desert Trips for this adventure. Said picked us up promptly at 9.0am from our Ryad in a very comfortable air conditioned Mercedes Mini Bus with separate driver, leaving Said free to provide us with a very informative and interesting commentary on every aspect of our experience - in very good English I should add. Apparently before guiding tourists he was a teacher. We had a really full day which included a camel ride, a visit to an Argan Oil Co-operative, the Monday Berber market which was amazing and a real eye opener, lunch in a great location on the riverside, a trek to the famous waterfalls, finishing on the way back to Marrakech with tea in a typical Berber family home. We were not hurried at all and although originally expecting to return by about 5.0pm we didn\u2019t actually get back to our Ryad till after 8.0pm.

We ended our first night at the Skoura oasis at a magnificent hotel that clean and full of charm. The second day Kamal took us to the Gorge's where we took amazing pictures. Kamal always has surprises and along the way to the desert we stopped at several places for pictures and tours. We later arrived at hotel that is right outside the Dunes where we would be camping for the night with local Berber residents. We rode camels to the campsite. We spent the night eating traditional Berber and listen to Berber music. We woke up early the next day to catch the sunrise and headed back to the hotel. Kamal was there to great us and got us on our way. We thought this was the end of the trip but Kamal took us to a local village to listen to Gnawa music. We stopped at another oasis and took in other sights in the way back to Marrakesh. We had a great time with Kamal. He was excellent and went the extra mile to ensure we enjoyed our trip.

We were only in Morocco for 3 days, so a day tour to get in as many sites/attractions as possible was a must!

I immediately made contact with him and was glad that I did. From the very first point of contact to the final second of the tour, Said did NOT disappoint! His professionalism, his wealth of knowledge, his amazingly down-to-earth and friendly attitude and his willingness to make our tour as comfortable and enjoyable as possible all made for an unforgettable trip! Said was a gentleman in every way and even accommodated a last-minute request to change a minor portion of our tour. We went to the Agafay desert (definitely FUN times in his 4x4 up steep sand dunes!) where we also saw a movie being filmed, we had lunch at the stunningly beautiful Lake Lalla Takerkoust, drove through the lush and breathtaking scenery of the Atlas mountains and Plateau du Kik, drank tea at the home of a charming local Berber family, visited Argan oil cooperative, and Said was even kind enough to squeeze in a bit of the Medina for us to view because we would have left the following day without seeing it. And all this at a price of 40 euros per person was unbeatable! We definitely recommend Morocco Desert Trips to anyone wanting an EXCELLENT experience - whether short or long stay - in Morocco!

He stopped the car for photos of the Atlas Mountains whenever we asked him to and we both enjoyed the drive, he gave us lots of information about Moroccan life and made sure we were happy throughout trip. Once we reached the valley we were introduced to the local Berber guide (the cost of which was included in the fee) and he took us hiking up a waterfall. On the way we were able to stop and look at all the beautiful things created by local artisans.After the hike we had a Moroccan lunch, which wasn't the best meal we had in Marrakech but was fine, it's worth asking Said beforehand if you have particular special dietary requirements. We were then being driven back to Marrakech with a short stop off at a traditional Berber house overlooking the valley. The day lasted 8 hours and was an truly unforgettable experience.A few tips if you're taking the tour, wear comfortable shoes with good grip for the walk up the waterfall and bring a big bottle of water as it can be difficult to pick some up along the way, all costs are included in the tour fee but we did feel a bit of pressure to spend money from the local merchants - if you want to avoid that then maybe mention it to him before you set off."

His email replies were always prompt and helpful.We were picked up at 9.30 from the door of our Riad and taken to a clean and air conditioned 4x4. We returned around 5.30.Unfortunately the weather was very bad, but there was still many opportunities for great photos along the whole route.We stopped off at a Berber village house and had traditional tea, and also an extra stop where we were shown how Argon Oil is made. These were great added extras that I know we will remember for a long time.The highlight of our day was a trip up the waterfall. Whilst it was very cold, we enjoyed the walk very much. Remember to wear suitable shoes!! It was very steep in places. There were several souvenir shops along the way but there was no pressure to buy anything. Our guide took plenty of photos of us along the route. In total, it took around 1.5hrs to go up to the top and then back down. Afterwards, were were again greeted by Said and we had lunch in the traditional restaurant, which was included in the tour fee.Overall a great day and we will definitely book a desert tour if we return to Morocco!"

A warning to anyone who decides to walk to the Waterfall, this is a fairly steep hike and not on a trail so ensure you have good flat walking shoes/boots. (Unlike a woman we saw struggling in high heel sandals!) The views are breathtaking and the meal at the Berber village was very nice. Would highly recommend this trip"

As we were in Marocco for a short time, we booked one day tour to Atlas mountains http://www.moroccodeserttrips.com/excursion-desert-maroc-1.php It was very picturesque trip with lot of nice spots to take pictures, we had lunch with great traditional food in restaurant with nice view and at the end we took a walk to mountains to see waterfall. What I really liked that in spots we stopped , we could by some souvenirs without any pressure - Said really took care that we can have relaxed and beautiful day. At the end there is only one think I regret- that we did not have more time to have dessert trip with Said - with him I could go for many days tour knowing that everything will be just perfect."

The price included one lunch (which was the best we had in Morocco) and local waterfall guide fee. If you go for this tour remember to have shoes with you that are suited for small climbing. The waterfall has small trails but there are almost no stairs. The local guide at the waterfall will help you of course. Said spoke good English and was always there to answer our questions about Morocco. We are definitely coming back some day for 3 day tour to desert with Said."

We both had a fantastic time climbing up for about an hour or so. Jamal also had perfect English and told us everything about the history of the Berber people and their way of life. We passed through villages in the mountains as well as a couple of beautiful waterfalls where we stopped for drinks and a spot of picture taking.Overall, the experience was worth while and both Said and Jamal made the tour very interesting to say the least :)"

            "review": "Day trip to Atlas Mountains. My wife and I were on our honeymoon in Marrakesh in April this year and were keen to get the balance of a chilled holiday following the excitement and stresses of a wedding. We opted for a day trip to the Atlas mountains as one of our excursions - and were extremely glad that we did! Our guide Said was absolutely superb. As well as being extremely knowledgable about the area and the people, he was exceptionally engaging and personable. He was also very much on his guests' side when it came to visiting tourist attractions - he has a policy that if he finds out a shop or attraction has charged his guests too much, he will not take guests there in the future. When a passing tradesman stopped on his moped to sell us fossils - Said spoke with him and told him that he 'does not bring tourists up to the mountains - only friends' and that he would only accept a fair price from him. Trained in philosophy, Said is a real gentleman and his top priority on an excursion (and it seems in life) is that his guests enjoy themselves and take away a positive experience of his beautiful country. I can categorically say that both my wife and I did - thanks to him. The day trip itself is ideal for those who are not staying in Marrakesh for too long (we were only 7 days). It was only a couple of hours drive to get up into the mountains. It is not a strenous day and you are in the vehicle taking in the sites for much of it (and they are stunning sites!) but there are plenty of opportunities to get out and the trip takes you through authentic, old settlements - with time to peruse around. The day culminates in a late lunch at a great cafe with stunning views over the river - followed by a small excursion up to a couple of waterfalls (about an hour and a half trek up and down). We found that it gave us a real flavour for the area and a desire to go back for more (hopefully in the future we will go back to do some proper trekking in the mountains). We booked Said in person - as he was driving us into Marrakesh from our hotel (the highly recommended Sirayane Boutique Hotel) as part of their free shuttle bus service - but you can book him directly through http://www.moroccodeserttrips.com/ One things for sure - when we do make it back, we will be in touch with him to go on one of his longer trips!!"

When we arrived we had started talking to another couple staying at the hotel, they recommended us to do the Atlas mountain day tour and to do it with Said. We were not disappointed he picked us up at 9.15am in a private car and we made our way to the mountains. He was very good at explaining everything about morocco that we had to ask. He even stopped off a few times on the way for us to look in some local side stalls. When we arrived an hour later firstly at the place where they make the famous argan oil we had a small tour around and had the opportunity to buy some oils and spices. We then carried on making our way up the mountains. We arrived and started our walk up the mountains with a separate tour guide. It was beautiful! I would say take some comfy shoes as the rocks are a bit big to climb and it's uphill but the views are beautiful. Once we got to the top there was an amazing waterfall, a good opportunity to take some pics. We made our way down and stopped to have lunch on a roof top terrace over looking the river and mountains. Then made our way to a local Berbers house to see how they live. Defiantly an eye opener. We then made our way to Marrakech while Said told us more about the local people and the beautiful country of Morocco. I would recommend this tour if your staying in Marrakech for a short while as it's not too long and defiantly a tour to remember. Don't forget to ask for Said! He was very professional and friendly."

We travelled in comfort towards the Atlas Mountains and en-route stopped for a tour (booked by Said) of an oil, herbs and ointments production place where we were shown manufacture of cosmetic oils and were able to purchase spices, soaps and cosmetics and a fraction of the UK retail price.As we arrived at Atlas we were introduced to a local guide of Said who travelled with us to see a waterfall in the Ourika valley.At the end of our climb and descent, Said seated us in a restaurant arranged a very reasonably priced meal and even assisted with the ordering.Unfortunately, as we had young children everything was delayed on our part - but Said was an Oasis of calm, did not rush us, and instead built up a rapport with the kids who were delighted by the breadth of knowledge Said possesses and were addressing him as Uncle Said by the time we returned.I now have one point of confusion: whether I was impressed more by the breath taking waterfall or the immensely talented Said! Over the past decade my family and I have travelled through Europe, Turkey, UAE and Arabia. I have met plenty of tour guides but have never met anyone as warm, kind and professional as Said. This chap makes the excursion a memorable experience and allows tourists like me to have peace of mind as he takes all the headache, pressures and pit falls of being a foreign country on his shoulders. Anyone travelling to this part of Africa should contact Said as he is not only a gem of a host but a very respectful young man who gives peace of mind, value for money and is an asset not only to SPH Tours but Morocco itself.In terms of rating the Atlas Mountain excursion is 5* - Said is 6* if there is such a rating!Thank you Said."

Accommodated our wishes all through & very knowledgable about the area.The waterfalls climb was a bit scary because of the wet grounds, but well worth it for the views & meeting the locals along the way.The Berber home was an eye opener & we were even taught how to make Moroccan tea.We manage to squeeze Carmel ride into the day as well.The restaurant Said recommended for dinner was good & we left struggling to walk because all 4 of us were so stuffed with tasty food.Will be calling Said when next I visit Morrocco."

Said showed great knowledge and passion which made our trip even more interesting. I would definitely recommend going to visit Ourika Valley. Breathtaking views, friendly and modest people, great experience climbing the waterfalls and to finish the day a trip to a typical Berber House. It was a day we will never forget and we hope to go back someday to continue our adventure,once again thank you Said!"

My friend & I had such a good experience with him during a short journey, we decided to go to Essaouira with him the next day.Said was knowledgeable about the area, very service-oriented and trustworthy. He listened to our wishes, patiently allowed us to take our time and make several stops along the way. We never felt rushed and he took good care of us.The next time i visit Morocco (wish i hope is very soon), I will book a tour with Said again."

            "review": "A really fantastic paddle boarding experience. I'd had paddle boarding recommended to me by a friend, as a fun and unusual day trip to try while we were in Marrakech. So after a few days of soaking up the sun, my partner and I were ready to peel ourselves away from our sun beds and do something a bit more active! It was incredibly easy to book and pay (we paid online in advance) and Dunes & Desert provided all the information we needed ahead of time - pick up location, what to wear etc. The location, a dam built in the 1930s, is beautiful - the backdrop of the Atlas Mountains is so tranquil. Our guide, Mark, who runs the company, was incredibly warm and welcoming and instantly put us all at ease. We changed (you have to embrace wearing crocs!) and after some instruction, we hit the water. We'd never been paddle boarding before, but it's really easy for beginners to pick up, especially on such a calm lake, and Mark made it fun for everyone - even jumping in too when we all started to fall in (be prepared to get a bit wet and remember to bring some dry clothes!)After an hour or so of enjoying the scenery, we stopped off on a small island for a special treat, involving traditionally made mint tea (which is more difficult to make than you'd think!) - it was a lovely touch and showed real thought has gone into making the experience special.We returned to the water, and spent some time paddling out to look at some of the local wildlife - including an eagle. We then headed back to base to get changed and found a delicious lunch waiting for us, which was much appreciated after our time on the lake. All the food is included in the price of the experience, you just need to pay for drinks - we highly recommend the rose wine, it's great with the food and the sun!Overall, it was a great day, and we can't recommend this highly enough. Mark is a born host, who genuinely knows and loves the area - it's an enthusiasm which is completely infectious! We would have given this six stars if we could."

All round great experience and highly recommended as something a bit more unique. The guide, and owner of the business, Mark was amazing. So welcoming and always going the extra mile. He was professional but funny and very well informed on the local area etc. It was just us and another couple so we got all the attention needed. Definitely worth doing and I'm sure all the other trips are just as good! Thank you Mark & Dunes & Deserts!!!!!"

Unlike some other companies around there with this tour you really get to ride in a desert as suppose to right outside a suburb. The tea break felt authentic and the people at the Berber house were nice as well. The reason for the 4 instead of a 5 is because it was impossible to reach them to confirm pick up location as I was in the medina. It is stressful when you cannot communicate and wonder if you got scammed... But the driver was there on time at my hotel, so no big deal at the end of the day...I do wish I was told that your clothes ... And pretty much everything you bring gets including yourself will be covered in thick dust. It was amazing fun but do not bring anything you care about except family members or friends of course. They do offer a picture service and did a good job at it."

Picked up promptly to a slightly dry oasis just outside of town. We were geared up for a forty minute camel ride to a local family who prepared Moroccan tea and crepes for us and we sat down together with the family for a casual meal whilst being told about life and Moroccan history. This was followed by another forty minute ride back to where we started. Although there were only four of us on this tour, we had two guides and a photographer who gave options to buy professional shots. They also had their own camera with pictures which can subsequently be downloaded from their Facebook page. We were taken directly back to the hotel after the experience.A simple and yet lovely experience. Very well organized."

It was so easy to book and very well priced for everything we got! Highly recommend doing this experience.We were picked up outside our Riad and driven in a nice air conditioned van into the Atlas mountains where we were greeted by the most incredible view and nicest staff. We were fitted out with equipment which looked close to new and given a lesson on how to actually do stand up paddle boarding! The lesson must have been good considering it was both our first time and neither of us fell in.We were taken around the lake in the Atlas Mountains and stopped once for mint tea, where we were showed exactly how this was authentically made in Morocco, and other times where we relaxed on the boards and enjoyed the views. Once we were back on shore, a feast was prepared at the restaurant overlooking the lake. The meal at that restaurant is reason alone to do this experience, the actual paddle boarding is a bonus!A special thanks has to go to Mark who was our guide for the day and really went out of his way to ensure that we were both comfortable on the boards and having a great time. He showed this at the end of the day when he took us out in his own car over the dunes in the desert as we wanted to see it, something he definitely didn't have to do. It is also worth noting that he takes his Go Pro camera with him and takes pictures of you and emails you them all free of charge. Mark really made this day incredible for us and is a brilliant example of how great the staff are at Dunes and Desert."

We sent them an email, and they replied swiftly with details and prices. They're so good in arranging transport back and forth from where you're staying or close to it. Its all included in the prices. They have 2 options for timing, we went for the 9 o'clock take off, the weather was still great, not too hot. We wanted the quad biking only. I think this is the best activity to go with your mates. It was 4 of us, the driver was on time waiting for us, picked us up, then we travelled to pick up a french couple from another place then headed towards the desert, where we found the base, quad bikes, buggy cars, camels. The staff nice and welcoming, they speak in Arabic, French or English. They give a quick head up about whats going on, you have to sign a piece of paper that you agree to the risks etc. They have lockers to put your stuff in. They provide you with helmet. Then they give a brief lesson about how to drive a quad bike, every group has a guide. we felt we are lucky coz our group is made up of 5 bikes, with guide its 6. so the biggest at that day, they rest they were either 2 or 3. I felt it was quite fun to be chasing a bigger group and wait for each other. the first 10 mins was a warm up, the guide keeps an eye on you, then choose who will go behind and last. Then the journey starts, into the deep desert, into highways, in the middle of no where. 2 and a half hours of fun and thrill. during that time, there was a planned 3 stops, 1st one is to take a professional photo by their own photographer, which at the end if you want it, you can pay 50dhs \u00a34 for the copy, or you can ask them to send it via email for similar price.Then the second stop is on a hill, great view, they give you cold water, we met up with other people and had a good laugh. we continued the drive until we got to the place where they have a tent, and they offer you a snack, tea with pastry and honey(looks like crepe) , it was just delicious. Then, we headed back to base. It was just well organised, very caring guides, easy going, great adventure overall, wouldn't expect more from it."

We were picked up really close to where we were staying (couldn't get a van where we were staying) and were transported to the site. We were taken to a shaded area and given water, had some h&s forms to fill in and then all had our cheche scarfs put on. We then mounted the camels, 45 min or so to a berber house where we had mint tea and a snack. Delicious and fun! Then it was around 30 min or so back. The guides were entertaining and friendly. Constant supply of water as and when needed. They were happy to take photos along the way (with your camera, plus they had a company camera, and there was a professional photographer whom you could purchase photos off at the end). Once back, we had some more water, the option to purchase photos, and then were transported back to the point we were picked up from. It was a fun, picturesque and interesting trip and we were so glad we did it.My tip: It was so hot it didn't matter if you were covered up or not in terms of how much you sweat, but I would recommend covering up, there was no shade and it helps you stop getting burnt (I wore a linen shirt and light walking trousers). All in all a great trip, loved the camels (especially Madonna, my camel!), the guides were great, staff helpful. Would recommend!"

It looked good from the pictures and we really liked the sound of it. We were picked up and taken to meet up with our guide Jerome at lake Lalla Takerkoust in south Morocco, roughly around 45 minutes from Marrakech. The lake was a beautiful sight and very peaceful in the early morning. The paddle boarding was really good fun, you can go at your own pace over the lake whilst taking in a timid peaceful environment, with plenty of time to enjoy the views. We paddle boarded over the lake and as far possible down the river we could (this time of year the river has dried up a little however this did not affect the experience at all!). We stopped mid-morning for some Morrocan bread at a local persons garden, which was a great experience and then made our way back to where we began. This was around 14:00 where we could get cleaned down and changed in to our spare clothes ready for the lunch also included in the trip, which we enjoyed!Our guide Jerome is a really nice person and goes out of his way to make your day the most it can be. He took many pictures on his waterproof camera which he sent via email once we were home, free of charge. He enjoyed lunch with us and gave us more recommendations on places to eat, visit and transport services, if i went back i would like to meet him again!Thanks for a wonderful trip Jerome!Tom and Emma :)FYI - Dunes and desert have a facebook page with plenty of photos of this trip and all the other excursions they do!"

I'm sure it didn't help that it was probably the hottest day ever in Morocco that day but i got pretty ill afterwards from being outside doing the two activities the whole day - there was no real break and i over heated so bad under those quad helmets and gear etc!

We then got split up into smaller groups, we were with 2 other people (4 of us altogether) but after maybe 10/15 mins, another of the staff members let my boyfriend and I go with him as he could see that we were 'very good' on the quads :) this made the experience absolutely INCREDIBLE!

Will recommend this particular excursion to everyone I know visiting Morocco. A few tips... bring shades, wear comfy clothes - you will get dusty, probably a good idea to book a hammam afterwards! Bring a camera but they do send you good quality pictures by email too. The instructor goes at your pace and although you are thrown in the deep end, they make sure you are comfortable riding the vehicle safely. The camels are nothing to be scared of, they are really clever and well looked after! Don't bother booking with cheaper agencies this one is the best!

The team are great from the French Canadian lady to the wonderful moroccan team of guides and guides. When I got on the camel I thought it would be too boring but the other people were great and we had good fun conversing. All in all book it without hesitating. Collection from our riad was prompt and well organised. The quad bike ride was great as we after mutual agreement divided into 2 groups - one easy and one faster."

The guide was fantastic and made sure we were always safe, but he didn't do this by making us go at snail speed. The pace was perfect, the terrain was magical and the experience was phenomenal! A definitely highlight of my trip to Morocco.It is great that they always have a maximum of 4 people per guide - so that way it doesn't get overcrowded and you're not waiting around for many people. The food and tea at the village completely hit the spot too.The tour we did was during ramadan and I don't know how the guides managed to not even drink any water or eat throughout! But it did not impact our experience at all.I would definitely recommend this to any and everyone travelling to Morocco. Next time I'd like to do the longer trips with the them!"

            "review": "Unforgettable Experience. The overall experience was amazing. We were a group of four and were picked up by an arranged transport (by dunes&desert exploration) from outside of our Riad in Marrakech. When we got to the base in the middle of the desert we had to fill up info forms for formality etc.After the whole induction thing we were clothed by the staff with a desert head scarf to protect us from the heat (looks awesome). Photos were then taken as a souvenir and you have the option of buying any official photos taken after the whole activity. First activity was a camel ride that takes you to the Berber village where you get a delicious snack of Moroccan pancakes and mint tea! The berber people provided a short entertainment of singing (as authentic as you can get). Camel ride back to the base after this. Quad biking takes up half of the day as the first session takes you back to the berber village for lunch (salad, bread, tajine and mint tea). After lunch there is nap time!!! You'd think it'd be roasting to take a nap in the middle of the desert but it was actually very breezy and the silence will put you right to sleep. Second part of the quad bike then takes you near the foot of the mountains...we stopped over to absorb the view and have a drink of water. It was then the quad bike trip back to the base.It's one of the experiences I will never forget. The staff are very helpful and takes care of you in all ways they can. To mention a few, Rasheed, Hamid and are really nice and welcoming. If you are going to Morocco make sure you do take on this dunes&desert experience as it will give you the real taste of morocco. The price for the camel ride and quad bike is very much worth it."

There's a break for water about 1/3 way through and another break at a remote house about 2/3 way through where they have carpets and shelter laid out in the sand and have tea and crepes laid on.

The van picked us up promptly and we were off to the location for the start of our ride. The welcome from the starting point was lovely too and it was the beginning of a great journey because we met a lovely couple who loved to travel. They provided shesh for everyone to wear to protect our heads from the sun. The one hour ride to the village as fairly comfortable as long as you shifted yourself in the saddle every 5 or so minutes. We were entertained with lots of songs and photos in between. Aziz, one of the guides also made us crafty camel rings he weaved using palm leaves. TIP: make sure to wear trousers when going on the camel ride! and no need to bring water bottles since they provide water and cups for the whole group.Once we got to the village, the family was very welcoming and we got to have some mint tea (which I adore, considering I do not drink tea at all) and some moroccan pancakes with honey and sesame seeds. While having tea, we were entertained with some local songs accompanied by drums and you got to participate by clapping along to the beat. The camel ride back was a lot faster. Although we weren't too keen on Aziz's suggestion to get the camels to a gallop, we enjoyed the journey back to the base, where we returned the shesh and grabbed our belongings that we placed in a locker provided. But the most wonderful service happened after the camel ride experience. We got dropped off at Jemaa al Fna with the van. It was silly of me but I dropped my mobile phone in the van and realized it several minutes after we got dropped off. I rang the company straight away and they were very helpful in taking in notes about my phone and told me they will contact me once they have heard back from the van driver if he saw my phone. Several minutes after and by God's grace through kind people, the company rang back to say they have found my phone and can return it at the same meeting place within 15 minutes. The van driver gave me back my phone and he refused the tip I wanted to give him, but I insisted he take it as a thank you for his kind act. I am very thankful for that kind person for returning my phone. God truly works in mysterious ways.Thank you for the lovely experience!"

            "review": "Camel/Quad Combo = FUN Day in Marrakech. This is a great company that I definitely plan on using during my next visit to Marrakech. Firstly, our pick up was scheduled for 8:45am and a fully air-conditioned van pulled up to our location at 8:45am. That NEVER happens with these types of excursions; they're usually late or you're suffocating the entire ride. D&D is located a short 20-30 minutes from the square so you're not wasting precious vacation time getting there either.I did the Camel/Quad combo and we started with the camel ride. The camels are friendly and amusing so, as long as you hold on when they tell you, you'll have a fun and unique experience. The guides were hilarious and had very good relationships with the camels. The crepes and mint tea we received were the best I've ever had. I'll be chasing that meal for the rest of my travelling life.The trip back was much like the trip there so I will skip ahead to the Quads. We got a safety and instruction brief and were off in no time. The only downfall of the day (which is a first world complaint like no other) is that we headed back to the house where we previously ate way to soon after our initial visit. We had an amazing lunch but couldn't enjoy it as much because we were so full from our amazing breakfast. The tagine was DELICIOUS; seriously, the best! Our quad ride was long but not too long. It was enough to let loose on the bikes and have a great time in a beautiful atmosphere. We stopped for a water and photo-op break in a peaceful and picturesque location.A photographer is there throughout your visit to capture your experience. Afterwards, some free pictures are posted to their FB and there are also some great shots available for sale (bring cash - Dirham - for these). I never buy pictures from anywhere but there were 2 shots that I couldn't leave without. D&D did not disappoint. I'll be back!"

However it was not the experience of a lifetime that many other reviewers posted about. The company is very professional and provide the services as expected. However it should be noted that the Agafay desert is very commercialized and has many farms. It is about a 20 to 30-minute drive from Marrakesh. The experience also depends on the type of people you go with in your group.thus everyone experience can be different. I would pick either the camel ride or the ATV not both. The camel ride is quite fun and exciting the first 10 minutes however many other people felt it was too long. The ATV was fun but not a unique experience like the camel ride."

Previously we visited Marrakech and took quads into the Atlas Mountains, across a variety of terrain including villages etc which was really interesting, this we found a bit of a boring route without any challenges other than the final part where we were taken into sand dunes for about ten minutes riding into chicanes -that was great fun. The people were fun and appeared to enjoy our company which must be tough for them doing this all day every day I guess, but you'd never know it, they were happy and accommodating -typical of Marrakech people; full of respect and a pleasure to spend time with. All in all a good day out be aware the camel ride is fairly long and particularly the guys may end up walking like John Wayne by the end of it!!!"

Altogether we were out on the bikes for about 3-4 hours. First we stopped off at the top of some hills where we had amazing views and could see to the Atlas Mountains. We then continued and stopped off at a locals house. He had made us pancakes with honey and tea. We then rode back to the start point. The views were amazing and everyone was happy to see you with the shepherds and children all waving and smiling at you. Great experience and excellent value for money, costing around \u00a3100 for 2 bikes for the whole afternoon. Highly recommend this trip!"

Although the weather turned cold this was a fun 3 hour camel trek around the barren landscape. Well looked after by lots of guides, this included a couple of stops, loads of photo opportunities, a local drinks break and a sore backside (!) on the tireless working camel.Wrap up warm if the weather clouds over, but a great laugh and good value."

We ate with the same local family for lunch and dinner and the setting was stunning. The camels were an experience not to be missed as we trekked across the desert in a camel train. After lunch we returned to swap camels for quads. We were taken for a three hour quad bike ride with just ourselves and instructor. We went up the mountain tracks and were provided with superb views as well as driving through a couple of eye opening mountain villages. Extremely recommend."

            "review": "Camel & Quad - Fun day in the desert. My three companions and I booked the Quad and Camel combo through their website. I learned about Dunes & Desert from a travel forum I frequent. I was a little nervous paying 100% upfront on the website (instead of simply putting down a deposit or paying the amount on the morning of), however the payment and booking process went smoothly (paypal) and they picked us up on time. First they took us to their main office where they had us sign a waiver and went over the basics of camel riding. The man working with us knew English very well. The whole \"intake\" process was extremely organized. We put our belongings in the lockers they provided, and then we went out to the camels. The camels were really cute, and were very easy to ride, even for a first-timer. Our guide didn't speak much English, however he was nice enough. My main issue with the camel ride is that it was LONG!! I believe they said it was 5 miles, but the camels walked SLOW and it seemed to take forever. It was enjoyable, but could have been cut down to an hour or so. If you have an adrenaline junky in your group, he may want to skip this part. Then you go to lunch at this nice outdoor area. It's very peaceful, and the tagine was ok. However, there is nothing for vegetarians to eat (unless you're ok with picking meat out of your food). Then we took the camel back to the office, and boarded the Quads after a short safety briefing. None of us had ridden quads before, so we were a little nervous, but it turned out to be the best part of the day! A driver guides you through various paths of varying difficulty and speed, including paths through villages. You start out slow, so you can get the hang of how to drive it, then you pick up speed and difficulty throughout the day. It was a rough ride at times, and we were a little sore the next day, but it was a LOT of fun!!! The views along the way were absolutely amazing! You stop at the top of this mountain to take pictures. I highly recommend it. One tip is to wear clothes you don't mind getting dirty. You will end up covered in dust. Also, they take pics of you throughout the day and sell them to you at the end. I forgot how much it was, but the price was moderate and they will negotiate. Also, the guides will take pics with your camera if you ask them. Overall it was a great experience that I highly recommend, even for beginners. The camel portion may be a little slow for people who like a little more action, but the Quads were amazing."

The first have of the tour was the camels. This fulfilled one of my childhood dreams of riding a camel into the desert. We rode the camels for about 2.5 hours round trip. 1 hour to a break site where we had a meal and then 1 hour back. There were 4 of us in total on the tour and the camels were tethered together. At the halfway point we met another group on tour. It was an amazing an scenic experience riding through the desert on these tall animals and our tour guides were very friendly, keeping the mood light and taking photographs using our cameras.The second half of the tour was the ATV quad bike tour. This lasted about 3 hours. It started with a safety brief an a quick familiarization of the vehicles before heading out. No driver's license required. It didn't take long to get used to the bikes and the tour took us through desert villages, past goat herders well into the desert. There was another break at the same location of the camel tour and then we proceeded further into the desert up into the Atlas mountains. The view from the mountains was epic and the day was just amazing in general. On the way back they took us through a technical course of winding dunes which took a little getting used to. I'm not gonna lie it was a little hair raising but very exhilarating. I really recommend the dunes & desert tour for a day filled with desert fun and hi-jinks."

Dunes and Desert provided both these things and did a wonderful job. We booked on the same day we wanted to go, the girl of the phone was very nice and explained everything, we were picked up near our hotel and driven to the site which was very convenient. The staff were extremely friendly and welcoming. The camel ride involves a slow paced walk through the desert and oasis palm groves before ending up in a small Berber village where you have snacks and delicious tea before setting back. Total tour was 2-3 hours. Guides were extremely friendly and hospitable even if some of our fellow guests were a bit difficult! I would highly recommend for a great day out from the city and a relaxing afternoon experiencing some local culture."

We would strongly recommend this trip to anyone with an interest of Morocco outside Marrakech. We were picked up near our hotel by our guide Moha in a clean and very comfortable 4x4 and driven to the hills by the Atlas Mountains with Moha expertly negotiating the thousands of scooters careering in our path as we left Marrakech!The main part of the trip was spent walking to a Berber village under the expert care of Saida. The walk was fantastic; not exactly a gentle stroll but not too robust and there were beautiful views and a fascinating insight of Berber life was provided by Saida. Once we returned to Saida's family home, we were given a wonderful meal while sitting outside contemplating the views.The journey back to Marrakech was just as good, there were plenty of opportunities to stop and take photos; Moha was an excellent and amusing guide and driver - the whole trip was the highlight of our Moroccan visit.

It did mean we had to give up our buggy to the injured party's.

This is perhaps the best tour company in Marrakesh for quad and a very good one for camel riding. The guides for our camel ride were absolutely gracious and funny. With their good humor and constant laughs, they made the experience exceptional. When it came to the quad portion, I got stuck at first with a small group that had never ridden so we went very slowly to our first stop for lunch. But seeing that I wanted more from the experience, the guide called his boss, who sent out a dedicated guide for me. My guide took me on the ride of a lifetime, running me at full throttle the entire way through the beautiful desert and through some grueling but fun terrain. My ride was more than I expected and I appreciated the fact that they accommodated my unique needs for speed and adventure... This is something that not many other places would have done and I appreciate that attention. I don't hesitate to recommend this place to the novice or adrenaline junky alike."

Great value, good memories.Thank you Banana(my camel) for a lot of great pictures and stories. (That is not me standing on the camel)"

We booked half day quad biking, you are linked with a guide who speaks your language (Arabic, English or French) - we were given a safety briefing and then we set off, amazing sights and sounds and overall an unforgettable experienceI would have no hesitation in recommending Dunes & Desert Exploration"

It isn't really a desert, but it is perfect terrain for quad biking. We were picked up on time and arrived to be given mint tea and filled in forms etc. We were given a fairly quick talk on the bikes and suited up with helmets, goggles, over-jackets and some long socks. After a short practice we were off for miles of fun riding. We stopped for a drink of water a couple of times and were given a really nice tangine for lunch. We ate quite a few tangines in Marrakesh, but this was one of the best. My daughter and her partner had also booked a half day ride. I have to mention that if you are not a confident driver/rider then quad bikes are quite demanding. It seems obvious, but you have to remember to steer! If like me you are used to a motorcycle you have to learn a whole new way of driving, especially if you want to get a move on. You are following a guide all the way and he signals when to slow down and seems to adjust the pace according to how confident people are. My daughter found it quite difficult, so this is not for everyone. You get hot and sweaty and covered in dust which they used an air hose to blow off us at the end of the ride, (a new experience for me!). Altogether a really good experience and recommended provided you can manage the quad bikes."

You also get to a high point near a small village which is great for photos of the surrounding landscape. If you want to have some fun and adrenaline in Marrakesch, and get pretty dusty at the same time, this is for you. Enjoy!"

We were picked up from the hotel and driven the short distance to the activity base where we were greeted with mint tea. After a short wait we were split off into our group and lead out to the camels. Having never ridden one I was a little dubious about how to get on but the guides were great in getting everyone on and off we went. The trek itself was fantastic, I wouldn't say the route was very scenic but still, there's something very relaxing about slowly trotting along on a camel. We picked the morning tour and heat was pleasant without being oppressive, I could imagine though in the height of summer or in the afternoon it might be a bit more of an issue. Throughout the guides were attentive and upbeat, helping people to relax and enjoy themselves. The stop for food was perfectly timed to give your legs and back a little break, and who can say no to pancakes with honey and mint tea?Overall a great experience, half a day seemed about right for a first time, though now having had a little experience I'd be tempted by the longer tours up into the mountains for a more scenic experience. Throughout we were looked after and the door to door service makes this completely no hassle to do."

We asked at our hotel desk (Le Kech Boutique) about going on a camel ride outside of the city, this was obviously a company they have some kind of deal with, but as the hotel we good, we had every faith this company would be also. We were given 2 time options, morning or afternoon and chose afternoon.We were slightly concerned about a few things, aside from having never ridden a camel before, we just didnt know what else to expect.If you want a good length camel ride, with great guides, that is made as easy as possible for you, choose these guys. We were picked up at our hotel right on time, we then picked up 2 other couples, i must admit having 2 other friendly brittish couples in the group probably helped make the trip.We were taken out into the desert where we got to their base, we were given water (out of a bottle of shop bought water) and were able to use the loos and then we set off.If you havent really ridden many animals before, this is the trip for you, because 2 hours sounds like no time at all, but when your legs and backside aren't used to it, 2 hours is enough, trust me here. Ths is also a great one for kids, we didnt have any kids in our group, but the family we joined up with for tea and pancakes did and the guides were brilliant with the children.After a short stop, it was back on the camels, who were very funny friendly creatures, back to base and a short minibus ride back to our hotel doorstep. I would reccomend this company to anyone that wanted a nice experience without any hassle."

When we arrived after our pick up everything was very organised and we were out into small groups, given lockers if needed and given helmets, goggles and socks to cover our legs from the heat of the engine. ( We signed a little contract too)We went out with a guide and he came up and spoke to us all individually about how the machines worked and how we felt about it / if we had done it before. i am not a driver and I have never been on a Quad so I was nervous and he made me feel relaxed and we went round for about 10 minutes close to the base just practising and getting used to driving which I found really useful. He then came over to double check that we all felt ok with it and I think he could see I was a bit nervous so he brought me to the front, just behind him, so I felt better. We then got going and went on a few different types of terrain and travelled approx 40-50km!! We stopped twice - once at the top of a small mountain where we could have a drink (provided) and take photographs. I didn't have a camera because I left it in the locker but the guide took photos and later emailed me them! The second stop was at a Berber tent where they provided local food and drink, berber Tea and lovely snack that I don't know the name of unfortunately but it was very good! We took more photos there too. I really lovely day out and the guide was awesome and so were all the other staff we came across at the base. Can't recommend them enough!"

I paid a small supplement to be picked up from the hotel, which was well worth it. My family had an amazing day for so many reasons. I know it's rare, but I have to say that I couldn't fault the package. It just flowed. There was time for excitement and time to relax and take it all in.The camel trek in the morning was a really relaxing experience away from the chaos of Marrakech. They made sure you looked the part for a camel adventure by setting you up with a desert Touareg turban\u2015 Lawrence of Arabia eat your heart out! With the Atlas Mountains as a spectacular back drop we set off through the dusty desert with our four friendly guides. We stopped after about an hour, which was perfect, and went to a Berber house for mint tea and pancakes with honey. We sat on the floor on big comfy cushions that were placed around low tables. It was simple but very traditional, with well-worn Moroccan rugs and a large hand-built wood and reed canopy to shade us from the sun. The Berber people were friendly and the service was great. I could've happily stayed there all day relaxing with my family. We went back a different way so it didn't get boring. The guides never stopped smiling and being cheerful. They regularly asked if we were ok and even found the time to weave camels out of palm tree leaves for the kids.I was a little concerned about safety on the quads, especially for my three children, but my fears were soon put to rest when I saw how seriously they took the safety side of things. We were kitted out with quality safety equipment and given a thorough briefing in English. Our guide was very friendly and experienced. He took it easy for the first 15 minutes to ensure we all had the skills to manoeuvre the quads.Happily, we went back to the same Berber house for a leisurely lunch. They were waiting outside with soap, water and a towel to freshen up before we treated to a delicious 3-course lunch (inc. a lamb & vegetable tagine), with plenty of water, soft drinks and mint tea on offer. The traditional homemade bread was to die for.This excursion was by far the highlight of our holiday and a fantastic way for our twins to celebrate a decade on this amazing planet \u2015and I have the photos to prove it!

This was my second time using D&D and like the first time it was certainly worth the money.For those complaining about not getting the required adrenaline rush when on the quads that might be because when you book a quad you go in a larger group, consequently you are only as fast as the slowest person in your group.I have always chosen to pay the extra to get the rhino buggy,that way it's just me,the Mrs and our guide. The only criteria is \"keep up\" and since both of us are not novices and love a bit of speed it means we get value for our cash.If you want fun that's what you need to do.Once again thank you very much D&D!"

Genuinely one of the nicest Moroccans we met on our holiday there.The booking process was very smooth and accomodating. Omar and Jerome were both very happy to help. Our transport picked us up from the hotel first thing and took us to the venue. We were the only couple on the bus on both legs of our journey - just goes to show the level of service on offer here. Very promising start.Upon arrival we were greeted, sat down and talked through the forms, given mint tea too which was a nice touch. After sorting out our locker we were introduced to the lovely Momo who was happy to help fitting us out with helmets etc.We had booked a 1 pilot & 1 passenger package for a half day through the desert, so after us both having a test to make sure we were comfortable with the controls we set off following our guide Momo. The views were great and andrenaline was flowing.Our first stop was up in the mountains were Momo was more than happy to take pictures for us and even going to the lengths of positioning our quad on some rocks to make the perfect back drop. He really went the extra mile. After consuming some water and the fantastic landscape views we set off again.The next stop was at a very traditional Berber Village. Momo shared his knowledge with us and took us inside where we met two lovely local women. We sat on the traditional cushions and had mint tea, pancakes and honey all made by the two women. A simple, yet wonderful experience, a real eye opener and break away from reality back in the UK. Upon leaving we thanked and tipped the women for allowing us in their home, the least we could do to say thank you.We then made our way back to the venue after exploring more of the landscapes and desert. What a fantastic experience we had! Once back at the venue we purchased a professional picture taken near the start of the trip for 50DH (5 EUR) which isn't a lot really. The trip was topped off by having the desert sand blown off us by Momo and an air gun. What a trip! We did this on Monday the 15th of June, which was also our last day in Morocco. It made our holiday and is both of our favourite memory of Marrakech. No hassle, no bother just great views, great experiences and great company.If you go on this trip,Thank you!Justin and Ellie"

Expensive for what you get, the lunch was not great. No sand, pictures on the website are very deceiving. Also we were abandoned in the desert for like an hour during the quad trip... Would not recommend for young people looking for adventure, they were very limiting on how fast you go with the quad and where you drive etc. For families with young children it would be great..."

The hospitality received from Saida and her family was second to none. Be warned that there is a climb up to a local village to see how olive oil is made. If you struggle with hills you are able to stay behind. Good footwear recommended. The lunch that was made was brilliant. Will recommend to others."

Quad bikes are easy to drive for those who haven't driven one before and easy to get used to. The stop off at the Moroccan home was a different and cultural experience which was a nice touch. You do get incredibly dusty so I wouldn't wear any favourite clothes. I would also recommend wearing long trousers as the heat from the engine can be really hot so would add a bit of protection."

We had originally booked to go in a buggy but decided we wanted to do quad biking when we got there which they let us without having to pay extra. You can keep bags etc in lockers there which is useful. The ride lasts for about 2 and a half hrs and is across rugged mountain teraine and desert. You stop off at a traditional Moroccan village for Tea which is a great touch. Overall a fun and well run experience. Would recommend wearing a long sleeve top and trousers as you are out in the sun for a while."

Very full briefing on what we were going to do (Quad Biking) and how everything operates. The safety gear was of good quality - helmets, googles and balaclava. We were given a trial area to follow our guide (we had two at front and rear) and get used to our machines. We then set off. I initially wondered whether the trip would be worthwhile because it looked flat all the way to some far away hills. However this was through a rocky desert landscape, past small holdings and groups of houses. WE reached those far away hills and went through a small pass to eventually climb a small hill. This had a 360 degree view around a small farming valley with workers in the fields. We had a drink of water, took some photos and set off on the return. We stopped at a Berber house for tea and fried flat bread and honey - nice.The friendliness of this team made the expereience (even air hosing you down at the end to get most of the dust away. I am glad we did it in the morning as we got the morning cool as the heat built.We booked through Viator and have no complaints - recommended."

When we stopped for a break of delicious mint tea and crepes with honey, we were bit relieved. The camels were very friendly. The guides lovely and funny, we kept singing along and made jokes. They were willing to take pictures with our cameras and also took professional photos that we could purchase. One of the leaders kept encouraging the camels to trot - fun! Unforgettable experience and highly recommended excursion to anyone up for a fun cultural experience.Next time, I'd challenge myself to the overnight expedition to Sahara.

On our way back we asked Moha where we could buy Argan Oil and a tea set, and he gave us great advise and showed us Argan Oil Cooperatives (bio certified) and another small shop.

I forgot to book in advance and when I checked on Viator the day before it had sold out. Our riad called through and managed to get us booked onto the morning tour anyway and I was elated! They came and collected us from our riad at 9am and drove us to the place. Very small amount of time is taken having some mint tea and filling out a form. They got us started on our quad bikes and gave us a little warm up to get used to them and then off we go! we got to ride through the desserts, palm groves and Berber villages. The little children all run out and hold out their hands for you to touch - but try to avoid doing this as it is not safe for them. My boyfriend struggled with the speed we were all going, which to me was very fast, but as he is a motorbike rider and loves speed it wasn't exciting enough for him. That was okay though as the guides were fantastic and noticed this straight away and actually took him on a different route one on one, so he could really go fast and do all sorts jumps and tricks that I would not be willing to do! I thought this was very good of them to do for him.Half way through the tour you stop on a hill with incredible views where you get some water and lots of photo opportunities. The guides were fantastic even suggesting good poses to do to get the best pictures. The tour then continues as you stop at a Berber village home for some snacks and tea before heading back to base.This tour was fantastic. It was fun, different and exciting. Seeing the local Berber people was a good experience and the route we took on the tour was great. I was also thoroughly impressed with the flexibility of the guides and their willingness to accommodate my boyfriends speed need! Please don't worry that because of this it is a slow tour, it most definitely isn't - you still get to go fast. I recommend this tour to everyone!!Tips:Go toilet at base before starting, to ensure you are comfortable for the tourWear your worst clothes - you will get absolutely filthy! I mean dust EVERYWHERE!If it is a sunny day make sure you slap on a high factor sun cream or even better bring a light shirt or hoody to throw over for cover. Also if it is slightly windy you may get cold on the bike.Bring some spare money, the tour guides are fantastic and you will probably want to tip them. We made the mistake of bringing only the exact money and I was disappointing I could not show my true appreciation.Next time we will do the full day tour!"

After a phone call it was all sorted, but we were now 45 min. late starting the tour. The other persons riding camels had left so it was nice to know that they were not waiting for us. The workers were pleasant so when we arrived we got personalized attention. Introductions were done, we were given a white head dress, and walked to our camels.Our tour guide was a comedian. He would lie on the camel, stand on its back, and other tricks. The kids enjoyed watching him. The other guide would make camels from long grass for the kids.Tea was a nice break Once again our group was by itself, so we just really enjoyed the outdoors. I would recommend camel trekking for 2 hours for any group."

You ride the camels for about 1.5 hours in all and camel riding is not comfortable so if you have hip or back problems it may not be for you. Otherwise not to be missed.

We had lovely crepes and mint tea mid morning and then back on the camels to head back to the main base prior to getting on the quads. The quads were brilliant - our daughters had to ride pillion but there was plenty of room on the quads and they had a fantastic time as did we all. We travelled into the mountains (2 hours in total) - the views were spectacular, we were travelling in 33 degrees heat and the Atlas Mountains in the distance had snow on them - stunning!

We had some trouble finding it and had to call the centre. The minibus then drove around Marrakesh and picked up 2 other groups of tourists - this wasn't the best start to the day and wasted about an hour.Dune Buggy Issues:Once we arrived at the Dunes and Desert base we were greeted and welcomed by the staff who were very nice. After signing a disclaimer which included assuming liability for any damage to the Dune Buggy/ ATV we were allowed to proceed. The Dune Buggy on offer was not as described or pictured and was more like a golf cart. It was explained to us that the Buggy was not as safe as previous models and had a habit of flipping over. We opted to ride an ATV instead although we asked for more money to have 2 ATVs. The terrain was mostly dry mountain paths. The experience itself was awesome:The views were unbelievable and there was an opportunity to stop for a photograph. Meeting the Berber family was a nice touch and the ATVs worked well.Overall:It felt like a few corners were being cut by the company which did affect our overall experience. Driving ATVs through the mountains is so fun and a slightly more polished customer service experience would make all the difference.Advice:Half day was plenty. We considered booking a full day but were glad to only do the half day because driving the ATVs does put a lot of pressure on wrist and thumb joints. Prepare to get very dusty!"

ABSOLUTLEY AMAZING. All details were sorted prior to our UK departure, (If you have any difficulty booking on the website just email them and they will email back and arrange everything).We were picked up on time and taken to the lake area which was approx 40mins drive from Marrakech. Once there we met Momo our guide for the day. He spoke very good English and gave us the full safety briefing for the quad bikes, provided helmets, goggles and gloves and also a protective smock/poncho to save your clothes from the dust. The quad bikes are easy to ride, even for me as I had never ridden one before. After a practice getting used to them we were off. The tour took us round part of the lake and through Berber villages and constantly changing countryside stopping for lunch with a Berber family in their home. Momo took us to areas not accessible to vehicles, on top of hills to look at the breath-taking views across Morocco. This was one of the best trips I have ever experienced and Momo was a star and a real professional. If you want more from a break to Marrakech than just the city then this is an absolute must.Tips:- Use the toilet before being picked up as it is a long morning without proper breaks \u2013 although water is provided and you can stop whenever you want for camera shots etc.Lesley & Tina"

We had a quick but informative briefing on the dos and donts, safety advice and signals, were geared up and then followed in a line behind our guide all the way.The experience was a great one, you get to drive across quite a varied selection of terrains and the guide is constantly looking out for you to make sure you're all ok. The quads were easy to use and along various points we would stop and have our photos taken by the guide across the desert. We stopped on a hill top which gave beautiful views all round for a good 20minutes having a rest and drink. On the way back we stopped at a Burber house to have tea and pancakes which gave us a chance to experience and understand Burber life through the great knowledge of our brilliant guide.The whole experience lasted between 2-3hrs and afterwards we were contemplating booking the 1day tour as we enjoyed it that much! The bikes can be tricky, uncomfortable and difficult to master to start with if you've not used a quad before, as you're focusing on everything at once, but after a good few miles you easily learn how to control the bumps and bends and enjoy it much more easily!The guide we had was brilliant, he made you feel safe and confident and having been doing it for many years, knew the area and track perfectly!

We were then give goggles, helmets and jacket, then was asked to stand around the quads whilst someone explained the basics. We were then led by a guide to the practice area and then off we went with the guide. Note: whilst riding your hands can get very cold so wear gloves, the guide was brilliant and let me use his gloves! What can I say about the quad biking - it was amazing, so too were the views! We made a stop at a Berber village for tea and crepes and then headed back to the station for our transfers back. They do take photos and say they will send them, but we were just sent a link to a Google plus site where I only found one photo of us, so make sure you take some photos of your own! I cannot fault the whole experience from start to finish. I would highly recommend dunes and deserts. Thanks for a brilliant morning :-)"

I was attending a business congress in Marrakech taling place at the Pullman Hotel and wanted to entertain an important client who is also a keen photographer. I approached the Dunes and Desert office and was helped by Soumia. I explained that I wanted something a little tailor-made with a flexible driver who was willing to stop while we took photos. We also wanted to see the 'real' Morocco. Soumia organised a day trip to a Berber village in the foothills of High Atlas. Our driver, Mohamed was very flexible, accommodating and fun to be with. We travelled through the foothills and stopped for both photos and a meal in a Berber household were we were hosted by Saida, After the meal, Saida took us up the mountain where we were able to take photographs and also understand the Berber way of life.The excursion was all we could have asked for and more."

The guides know the trails by heart, and they choose the best. Very nice views, and a very tasty lunch at a Berber's house. The guides are very friendly and it's fun to get to know each other! If my stay in Marrakech would be a little bit longer, I would take another quad tour with them!"

Anyway, when it came to the day of the trip no one showed up at the pick up point they gave us. After phoning the organisation we got told, they would send someone just to call back ten minutes later to tell us that no one is coming anymore. They asked us to rebook but since it was our last day in Marrakesh it wasn't an option for us. They promised to refund the money but it took them two more weeks and another email until I finally had my money back. We learned our lesson and rather book tours directly at the destination."

We went in January so it was chilly in the mornings but once you have a jumper or coat on you'll be fine. We drove through the Palmeraie and through mountains. The views are spectacular. We drove to a little berber house for pancakes and mint tea, sooo tasty. Well worth the money aswell. We are not experienced drivers and these people definately put you at ease and you get used to driving after a few minutes so its suitable for anyone. Chose Dunes & Desert for an unforgetable experience of Marrakech!!"

Our guide Younis tied the Moroccan style scarf so we can start the camel ride! It was quiet and peaceful. He offered to take pictures for us which was very kind. We arrived at a traditional house and were able to wash our hands (thank god!) and had crepes and more mint tea! The local man called Hisham taught us how to pour mint tea and let us practice (meaning we just made a huge mess and had a great laugh) Once we finished our break we headed back. On the way since we felt comfortable we asked to go faster and again more fun and laughter as the camels galloped! Younis tore some plant leaves off and we were wondering why but did not ask. 15 min later he presented us with the cutest camels made from those leaves. This was a thoughtful gesture :) Once we returned, we changed into the protective clothing and had the quad bike session. Our instructor was again very good and professional. He let us practice with him and also kept an eye out for the group. We stopped again at Hishams place for lunch (lamb tagine) and got fruit for dessert :) felt really welcomed :) Overall we will definitely go again but this time all get a quad bike each rather than sharing! :)"

The bikes and facility are in top shape, the staff welcoming and thorough, and the route fun and beautiful. My wife was apprehensive even as she started out on the tour. She even gave me a double thumbs down because she didn't know if she could control the bike. 5 minutes into it, she was as comfortable as if she'd been riding for yrs. The fact the bikes are automatic transmissions and that the tour leader takes us on a familiarization course at the start helped greatly.The scenery was gorgeous and I was trull blown away by the variety in sand, rocks and views. The villages were great to get up close and ride slowly through. The children wave and wave and wave. The guide planned relax stops at appropriate times and the break for tea and bread was opportune. At the end, my wife gave this two thumbs up and says she would definitely do this again on our next trip back to morocco.The owners of the company are great and very accommodating. They care about their guests and keep a tidy shop with skilled mechanics and staff. I highly recommend."

The guides spoke very good English which made us feel comfortable during our trip.We chose our bikes and were fitted with a balaclava, helmet and goggles. I would recommend taking a rucksack or sturdy camera case around your neck and nothing else, as there is no where to leave any bags whilst riding. We all engaged in a practice ride around a small track for a few circles to get used to the quad. Don't think you won't be able to do it, because that's what I thought and it was so easy and so so fun!The ride itself was fantastic, we saw the real Marrakech. Riding around farms with farmers and animals, small Berber villages, schools and over little dunes, seeing the locals and their way of life.After around an hour, we stopped for some mint tea, water and crepes in a little hut in the middle of the desert. Very surreal - but a great experience! We then rode back to the quad bike centre, where you are able to purchase a photo of yourself on board the quad for around 20 dirhams I believe, which is a nice souvenir.All in all, a fantastic half-day trip which allows you to see Marrakech beyond the little bubble of your hotel room, I would 100% recommend this trip!"

The driver spoke fantastic English and gave us a lot of local information and talked about his heritage and was really friendly. Admittedly as only travelled with hand luggage and booked while in Marrakech we didn't have exactly appropriate hiking footwear (Converse) or clothes (shorts and hoody). On arrival our guide noticed this and altered our trip accordingly and asked us if this was fine. He was a fantastic guide and as he was a local he gave us a fantastic insight into Berber life in the Atlas Mountains, such as Children walking for miles to go to school, how they conserve water, about their religion etc... He was very attentive and really looked after us. We went to a local homestay where lovely food was prepared for us and when it began to snow they lit the fire for us. The low clouds, and snow made the views spectacular! An amazing experience. No tips were expected or demanded and were genuienely great people! Would seriously reccomend this tour!

Opportunities for photographs and experienced the mint tea and square pancakes dripping with honey at a local village. The guides were very friendly and spoke reasonable english to have a laugh.

Omar was great to work with and after a snafu with the date (totally my fault) Omar made accomadtions to make sure we would still be able to enjoy the adventure. The dune buggys was the highlight. The guides were fantastic and fun. They arranged for pick up from our hotel which was great and the driver acted as our tour guide in route to the site. The camel rides in Marrakech were fun. You can clearly see the Atlas mountains and the camels were an adventure. I recommend you use Dunes and Desert for adventures in Morocco."

The company were very professional and helpful with all of the booking aspects. After arriving in Marrakech we discovered that rain was scheduled for the day we were due to go on the trek so we contacted the rep and there was no problem at all in changing the day.Our guide for the day Nourradine gave us the choice of 3 treks to do, and we chose to do the longest trek, around 6 hours of walking up to berber village at 2300m above sea level, setting off from the village of Setti Fatma in the Ourika Valley. I can only say that the entire experience was truly one of the most magical we have had. It was a beautiful day with no clouds in the sky and fresh snow had fallen to make it even more special. The views from the top of the walk were absolutely breathtaking. We stopped for lunch in the local berber village and ate with a local couple who were so welcoming and had cooked us a really special Tagine for lunch which we ate on their terrace overlooking the stunning scenery. The walk down was just as impressive and it was wonderful to see the locals going about their daily routine whilst we passed through. If you are looking for an authentic, eco-friendly and ethical trek into the Atlas mountains I would definitely recommend using Dunes & Desert."

Our guide, Fox, was brilliant, checking we were okay & taking lots of photos of us. We drove through a variety of different terrain, including the palm groves, dusty tracks, roads, rocky hills & even through a small body of water. We stopped for a delicious three course lunch of salad, tagine (vegetable or meat) & fruit at a berber village, with plenty of mint tea.

We opted in for a half day camel ride followed by lunch and half day of quadbiking. Once we arrived we were briefed. Started off with a camelride through the dessert, amazing views of palm trees and fantastic hot weather. Our guide was funny, charasmatic and always smiling. He even gave us a little gift of a camel made out of tree leaves. The views of the lake and mountains were definitely one of a kind. Must say, the camel ride was a workout. Not the most comfortable but worth the experience.We were taken to the most spectacular places for great photos. After two hours of camel riding, we visited a small house for some Morrocan tea and delicious home made pancakes with syrup. The atmosphere is absolutely amazing and laidback, sharing laughs with the tour guides and taking photos all the way through.After a 20minute break, we were given a safety talk for the quadbiking. We headed upto another house for an hour lunch break. This consisted of delicious fresh vegetable starters, freshly baked bread, lamb dishes with potatoes and lentils and a desert of fruits. This allowed us to top up our tans inbetween the food and relax .After lunch we proceeded to a 2hour quadbike through the dessert. Such a thrilling experience, riding fast through potholes leading upto the mountains for an amazing landscape view. Be warned, this is not for the fainthearted. If you are like me, who is scared of heights. This is the best way to overcome them. We were taken to delightful views of mountains, farm animals and sceneries.Having reached the mountains, we were greeted with more Morrocan Tea and a catch up with the other groups. We then proceeded to the next mountain across the field. Must say the flooring is quite rough full of stones so being careful and knowing when to brake is a must.Once we reached the mountains, it was an hour quadbike back. The tour guided were fun and raced along with us. Amazing tour guides who were witty and hilarious. Always caring for us and making sure we were ok. Overall a fantastic experience, really made our trip to Marrakech a memorable fun experience. We were only in Marrakech for 2nights and 3days but this made our time there worthwhile. Highly recommend. Prepare to have mud smears on your face. "

The guy who took us out was brilliant- really friendly, really good in making sure no one was left behind and really inclusive of everyone on our stops along the way. This was a brilliant must do in Marrakech. I would recommend it to anyone. Safety is clearly a priority with these guys but they let adults and kids enjoy it along the way. This was our highlight of our trip. Just watch out for your thumb for pressing the accelerator! My thumb took a week to recover! Listen to what the guide tells you- a week later I got use of my thumb back! We really enjoyed this and the guys organising it were brilliant! Thanks. xx"

The process was fairly simple although I did have to call them to give them my credit card number which was a bit dodgy. The staff did make sure that they booked the correct tour that I wanted in the end.On the day of the tour they were supposed to pick us up at our hotel early in the morning. We hired a private driver and were told we were the only two people on the day tour. The company asked that we be down in the hotel lobby early so the driver would not have to wait. As it turns out we are the ones that had to wait an hour. I had to have the hotel concierge call the company a half hour after the pick up time to see what the status was and it was very clear that they had forgotten about our booking. It was the only excursion that I booked outside of the assistance of the hotel concierge and we ended up regretting it.When the driver did finally arrive an hour late, he did not mention anything about being late to pick us up or offer an apology. More importantly, he did not speak English and we reserved an English language tour. It was a very long drive to Essaouira and back. Along the way we had a chance to look at the small villages and towns where there wasn't a tourist in sight. It would have been nice if the driver was able to tell us what it was that we were seeing and elaborated on the landscape. This ended up being an issue that seriously impacted our experience because the drive was a majority of the tour time.When we arrived at Essaouira the tour guide met us promptly at the beach. The tour guide was very good and he managed to do a great job of showing us the areas of the city that we were most interested in. He took us to a lot of fantastic shops that had quality handmade goods. The city had a lot of shopping and a fantastic beach that deserved more than a day trip.There was some good parts of this tour which is why I didn't give it a one star rating despite my displeasure with the overall experience. An English-speaking representative of the company ended up calling us on the way back from Essaouira but at that point it was too late to salvage the impression.When we made it back to the hotel the driver even tried to increase the rate of the tour final payment amount without reason. I have to wait in the hotel lobby while he called the company so that I could speak to someone and advise them of their continued errors. I would not use this company again and I wouldn't recommend them for anything unless they can shore up their customer service."

I saw Dunes &b Desert advertised online and decided to give them a try after reading some very good reviews.We hired 2 Quad bikes - one for me and one for my fella - but you can share one bike and switch drivers if you prefer. The cost was 100 for both of us and it was truly worth every penny! Be prepared to get dusty as you're out in the desert but be prepared to have a completely awesome unforgettable experience too - amazing! The Dunes & Desert guys are so friendly and speak fantastic English (And French). There were lockers to leave your things in, although I took my camera on the ride, and provide you with all the equipment like helmets, goggles and a protective jacket. The ride starts with a quick lesson on how to drive the quad bikes (Very easy) and then you're off :) My fella got the hang of it alot quicker than I did but after about 20 mins, I found riding really easy too. The terrain and the views were amazing, from riding on sand to rocks to clay and being in the desert in one direction and mountains on the other. Simply breath-taking!The experience itself was amazing with the highlights being stopping at the top of a mountain at one point and having mint tea and pancakes with a local family too. This is a must-do for anybody visiting Marrakesh and if we go back next year as planned, we'll definitely be doing this or taking one of the buggies out with the guys at Dunes & Desert!"

Saying that, it was still very enjoyable!The bikes seemed to be in great condition and the guys were very conscious on the safety of the group, which was reassuring.

The free hotel transport was a great service included in the tour fee. Super friendly staff with great concern for safety. I had an amazing time riding through the desert and villages along the way. Cold water was included for the duration of the tour which was much appreciated in the middle of the desert! Already looking forward to booking another tour for my next stay in Morocco."

            "review": "The Palmeraie ride has not a very beautiful landscape. We did the quads at August 20th. HIGHS:- the seriousness of the company about safety.- the material was in good condition.- the water and pancakes in the middle of the ride.- the kindness of the guides.- the free lockers.LOWS:- the landscape of the Palmeraie ride is not beautiful... there is only 1 beautiful view, the rest is just OK... we even past by a garbage spot by a dried river...- there are not dunes like in the pictures of the company website, not mountain landscape...- A bit boring for those used to ride motorbikes since you are not aloud to do and go wherever you want, go fast... you go on line... they are worried about your safety.TIPS:- Quads are very fun but very expensive so it's important to pick a beautiful landscape.- If you can choose another location for the quads like a desert with dunes in Essaouira, Ouarzazate... much better than the Palmeraie. If you are just staying in Marrakech and you have never ride a motorbike, you'll like it.- The heat during August was not a problem."

The staff are friendly and reassuring, and the stop offs half way through each took us to little family homes where we were able to rest, and they made us tea and pancakes. The quad biking was so much fun and the guides split us into ability to groups so the more confident people weren't held up by those who were a bit nervous and wanted to go a bit slower. There's a great mixture of sights and terrains, varying from going up a mountain to through a little village without electricity. An overall brilliant experience with a company wo clearly know their stuff. The camel ride was more relaxing though also lots of fun. Being close to the city, an not being able to get that far on a camel in an hour and a half, it's a bit of a stretch to say its in the desert, but la palmerie is a beautiful area and the trip they took us on was great. The camels looked a lot healthier and better looked after than others we saw, and they appeared to be treated well by the staff."

I booked the half day quad trip fairly last minute after reading the reviews and investigating other excursion companies, and,well... I'm very pleased I did. It was really faultless. From the beginning the booking process was very professional. Despite my last minute booking, the communication was very good and we were picked up on time at the agreed location. Upon arrival we were greeted by a nice gentleman who kindly made us a tea while we went through the formalities of the day. We were then fitted up with the gear, introduced to our 4-wheeled beast, and had a 5 minute training session in the open sand. Then, we were off. Due to the size of our group, they quite smartly broke us into two, and also very cleverly took different paths to end up at the same point. I felt free to go as fast as I pleased provided we didn't misbehave, and got to really experience the capabilities of the quad with a mixture of paved track, rock covered roads, sandy plains, and more rugged challenging terrain. The guide was always checking behind him so we didn't lose the slowest person, but as we seemed to have a fairly capable group, we kept the speed up. Before I knew it we had cruised through a few villages, stopped to give some people water, yielded to let a heard of sheep (I think) pass...before ascending the rocky hill to stop on top for a water / photo break. After we accumulated enough vanity shots to satisfy our social networking needs, it was down the hill for a mint tea and pancake break in a dwelling of sorts. After another 15 mins we were back at the HQ to de-dust and get transport back. It was definitely the highlight of the 4 days, and frankly, I'm already thinking about the full-day trip, or even the multi-day trip and a flight back. If you have the time, I'd suggest something longer, although I'm sure for those of you packing in alot to your trip, the half day will suffice. It's simply a blast - I can guarantee you'll talk about it for days to come..."

Sanaa replied to our e mail quickly and efficently . We were collected from our hotel Kenzi Agdal Medina on time and taken to the location . Sanaa met us and quickly sorted us out with safety equipment goggles , crash helmet , gloves and jackets , thus wasting no time. Our guide and im sorry i cant remember his name , was really nice , checked that we were ok and provided us with information on our stops . The villages you past thru give you a truly Morroccon feel , rounded off by a mint tea drink and Mezme (pancake).

We both had a great time enjoying the ride and the scenery. I definitely think it is fantastic for beginners.I would recommend paying the total price upfront as it cost \u00a310 fee from our bank to transfer the deposit the 3% card charge on the day - I just think it would have been easier to pay it all at the beginning. Wear a long sleeve shirt or good sunscreen.

The staff was helpful and provided a pre-excursion mini class to teach everyone how to drive a quad. One recommendation: you will get very dirty, so wear long pants and long sleeves, bring or get from them a pair of gloves because the sun is very hot and your hands will get burned !"

I went twice during our brief stay; the price is about right at around \u00a350 for a couple of hours of exhilarating fun. Mo was our guide, he certainly did not let any of the horses get unused and we had a break for pancakes and desert whiskey. There were four of us on my first trip and we opened up the accelerator on a few occasions bringing a smile that never left my face. I have to say quoting Miranda \u201cSuch Fun\u201d.The second trip was however was entwined with a Camel trip as well as Quad biking. All I will say is if you have a choice, leave the Camels at home it was more of a Camel carry than a Camel ride. They were tethered together so close the Camel behind might as well have hitched a ride with me. If he could (assuming a he) we could have had a great conversation. Disappointing; unlike the Quad biking of course, truly recommend it to young and old they vary the pace according to the group.If you have a choice drop the Camels and have the extra time on the Quads .\u201c Such Fun\u201d"

We were the only ones who opted for the buggy and so got our own guide who made the experience probably more than it would have been. We got to swap drivers and he even let us ride his quad for a bit too. Highlights were climbing up a shingle stack, speeding over sandy mounds, sliding around palm trees and the sandy half pipe. An amazing activity and not over priced for the time you get driving."

There we had a well received cup of local char with bread and honey.The quad bikes were next, the terrain is mostly flat so it was enjoyable but not challenging and was a good speed single file tour of the locality.

After a brief explanation we set off on a 2 hour tour of palm groves and berber villages. We had time to stop for tea and Msemem at a local Berber house which was very welcomed and broke up the trip nicely.

My fiance and I decided to take one of these quad tours on a whim and, to their credit, this company was able to accommodate us for a trip on the same day. Perhaps our problem was one of expectation because I have to say this simply wasn't what I expected. I was expecting, as pictured in the brochure, time to freewheel through sand dunes. What we got was the 4x4 equivalent of an escorted pony ride at the zoo. So, if you're expecting any type of adventure or independence, or anything more than driving single file through trails, then this isn't for you. Additionally, a majority of the tour includes \"visiting Berber towns\" which actually means tearing madly through peoples villages. It was great to see up close, but not really very socially responsible. Overall, I would recommend the tour especially for families but not for any avid quad riders or those looking for an authentic desert experience."

It was simple enough to book via the hotel, we were picked up promptly and transported to the HQ. There, they fitted us with helmets and gave us a little run on the quads. They cater for everyone - the more confident and the slightly more nervous riders. If you are a slightly nervous driver - they will sit with you on the quad and stay with you for the journey if you want them - it's all perfectly safe, don't worry about that. They will cater to every level. The actual journey on the bike is incredible. You're taken through the rock terrain, the desert and the villages - it's not an experience you will have again. There are times when you feel like you might topple over - but fear not, it won't happen. The staff are always with you and no one in our group (whether they were driving solo or not) felt anything but safe during the course of the day. And the final lap on the road - i got the chance to let loose and it felt amazing, going at that speed on the road - there's really nothing quite like the driver on those cars. All the staff there are beyond professional and really friendly. You stop for pictures on top of the mountain and a stop for tea and a some bread. It's a perfect half day, I would absolutely do this again in a heartbeat. It's not cheap - but all i can say is you won't regret it."

You will not be disappointed.!!"

You arrange your day on the internet, then a rep meets you at your hotel, the day before to collect half of the money. A minibus picks you up on the day from your hotel.. Very nice people looking after you and your family.. The guides take you down some crazy and exciting roads and tracks, through villages, up hills, through the dessert.. The faster drivers are soon filtered out and put together to drive a faster route, while slower drivers and children drive an easier safer route.. My advice, put on the big coat cover when they offer you it.. I refused it, and wore my shorts and T-shirt, i was covered in dust, ha ha.. I will definetly go here again with my freinds and family next time... Jerome (Manchester UK)"

We (myself and 2 friends - all male - aged 23, 19 and 18) have just returned back from our trip to Marrakech. Our quad biking adventure (on the morning of Wednesday 19th December, 2012) was a real highlight to our trip. Having pre-read some top reviews about 'Dunes & Desert Exploration' prior to our visit, we had no doubts in booking the half day quad biking excursion - and it certainly didn't disappoint! We were collected on time (9am) from our hotel near the centre of Marrakech by a professionally presented driver in a new 12 seater mini bus. Following an approx. 45min drive to the outskirts of the town, arriving into more desert style surroundings, we reached our start point. After a few minutes of completing some paperwork, we were each fitted with helmets and goggles, and then taken to our quad bikes. A quick safety brief (in French and English) was followed by some practice circuits to familiarise ourselves with the quads (350cc Yamaha's - extremely powerful and very fast, especially on the straights!!), and then we were ready to depart with our guides.The adventure took us through the dusty desert, over rocky hill tops (with amazing views and photo opportunities), through some traditional berber villages, and even stopped halfway for Moroccan tea and pancakes served by a local in their house. Our guides were well experienced, great fun and ensured we all thoroughly enjoyed ourselves - which we did!In total we spent approx. 3 hours on the quads, with the remaining time occupied by the collection and drop off transfer from our hotel (roughly 45mins each way), and the safety briefing/fitting of helmets etc..An overall superb experience, and a real highlight to our time in Marrakech. I would highly recommend this experience. It might not be the cheapest quad biking, but its definitely the most professional and well worth every penny! Just note - try to avoid wearing white clothes as you WILL be covered in orange/brown dust by the end of the trip!! Enjoy! :)"

We booked pretty late the night before but they were happy to accommodate us, and it ended up being only my girlfriend and I in the group. We were out with Mohammed who was a top guy - really happy and friendly. Beautiful scenery, crossing rivers, winding through tiny villages with cute kids who seem to have their day made if you wave back to them (and watch out for the chickens!), breathtaking views of the Atlas Mountains, and a great way to escape the money-grabbing madness of the medina for a while and see a very different side to Marrakech. I've been on lots of different tours previously and I really appreciate it when the people are lovely, put in the effort to make sure you enjoy it and dont let you feel like you're just a paying number (which happens depressingly often). From Marc picking us up, the people at the office, Mohammed on the tour and Marc's lovely wife dropping us off - we were made to feel really welcome, and this just adds to the experience.Top trip."

A fantastic lunch was prepared in one of the Berber villages and we than continued the day, crossing all sorts of different terrain from shallow rivers, to grid surfaces, little hills and larger hills (gorgeous views of the Atlas Mountains) and stretches of smooth surface (cranking up the speed of course). I absolutely loved this day, not in the least thanks to Momo and the team at place...big thank you to Dunes & Deserts"

The journey to the site was easy, although it would have helped if the driver had had a list of names or some ID to show we were getting in the right vehicle as at first it seemed like he was trying to sell us a trip! When we got to the centre, everything was very slick and we were given protective helmets etc and a safety talk. It had rained heavily a couple of hours before we set off so, despite the waterproofs, we got completely soaked within a few minutes of being in the buggy! Stopping in the Berber hut was very welcome for some hot mint tea and a pancake and was also a great way to get to know the other people in our group. Would thoroughly recommend this to others visiting Marrakech - one of the highlights of our trip."

Flying itself was an amazing experience and really not scary, it felt like we were not even moving in the air and we were comfortably sitting down.

It was awesome when we set off and hit a considerable speed pretty much straight away! We were so happy it wasnt a slow mooch around and 'touristy'. Mohammed was our tour guide, he grew up in one of the small villages and was very knowledgable. We first stopped at the top of a mountain which was beautiful and a few of the village children were there. They were so happy and let us have photos with them. We then went on to the Berber village and were lucky enough to see a wedding! We were shown around a mud hut and given pancakes and mint tea. We had lots of water throughout the whole trip as it was so hot which was such a blessing. We then got taken to the well and were told of life living in a Berber village before heading back to base camp. Overall, such an underated trip when in Morocco, highly highly recommended! The quad biking was so much fun but almost outshone solely by the experiance and what we saw. A real life tick! Everyone should see and do this!!!!!"

The weather was marginal but all had a really fun trip. Crepes and tea half way round were a welcome warm up.Would recommend to all for a fun tour of the countryside."

They picked us up at our hotel and took us to the centre. Practice and safety information were given. The quads were very fast and the time spent on the bikes was perfect. Great route and stop off for water (provided) and photos.Stopped at a Berber House for mint tea and pancakes - amazing. They provided the best Birthday Cake we have ever tasted, and everyone sang Happy Birthday.A fantastic experience! I cant thank the team enough :)"

First off we were picked up by the instructor from our hotel and driven to the dunes, after going through the T&C's we got changed into our racing gear and set off for our 2hr journey through the dusty, unpredictable turns off the desert area. Great instructor, always checking to see if we were okay and giving us great advise on how to handle the buggy etc. To be fair it would have been better if there was more twists and turns and an actual desert, but im being picky as i did quad biking in Egypt where the curcuit was far more rougher and tougher..But all in all, a pretty good adventure, being 30 years of age, i still felt like a kid hitting the pedal to the metal! Mid point we were treated to crepes and some mint tea in an old traditional house in the middle of the desert, we were made to feel very welcome and took many pictures.Would defo recomend to anyone who goes to Marrakech"

We called the night before to book the half day quad adventure and was told \"no problem\" be outside the Cafe de France in the main square at 9am. We were collected on time and taken outside the city to a facility with the equipment. We were given a form to fill out and some mint tea. We paid (in cash as there is a 4% cc charge). We were then given a clean balaclava, a modern clean and comfortable helmet, some goggles, and some gloves. We were given a little explanation of the rules (follow the leader and leave a gap of 15m), hand signals, a lesson on the controls, and some safety advice. We then did some slow serpentine turns and the guide assesed our ability and chose an appropriate order. We then set off at a slow pace and travelled though some wonderful landscapes. We passed local outcrops of people, sheperds with their sheep, men and women working in the fields, a construction crew errcting a power line tower, and local kids. Most of the time it was just us, the trail and great views. The paths were fairly easy going with only a few potholes to navigate. The most challenging part was going up a steep rocky hill where we had a water break and a chance to take some pictures. We had a few chances to open up the throttle on some back roads but overall this was very well organized and safety was a priority. We had some tea and pancakes in a berber hut which was a nice rest. When we got back we were dusted off with some compressed air and then taken back to the main square. Overall this was a nice experience."

Dunes & Desert Exp laid on suitable transport to/from their headquarters, which wasn\u2019t too far from Marrakesh and in perfect quad biking territory. The staff who greeted us were all very friendly and multi lingual and made us feel at home with some refreshing mint tea. After suitably kitting us out with good quality head gear we were given a tutorial/practice of the bikes and then off we went at a decent pace into the rock deserts following tracks, dusty roads and occasionally the rougher stuff, which was all a blast with a couple of entertaining instructors/guides. Water breaks were provided. We passed through villages too, including relaxing inside one home with wonderful \u2018berber whiskey\u2019 and a sweet pancake. Overall the trip was superb and faultless, especially at such a good price with a very well organised company. We enjoyed every minute and I would highly recommend this excursion to anyone with an adventurous spirit who is also keen to experience the wilds of Morocco and its people. Thanks again to everyone at Dunes & Desert Exp for looking after us and creating a brilliant trip. :)"

The landscape around Marrakech is perfect for offroad adventures and our journey took us over all types of conditions, through villages and up a hill which gave us great views. We had never been on quad bikes before but found them very easy to ride with a small amount of tuition. The bikes were good quality and felt very safe to ride. Along the way we stopped for water and a photo opportunity on top of the hill and further a long the trail we stopped at a Berber house for tea and pancakes. Overall I would really recommend Dunes & Desert for the quad bike experience, they communicated with me by email before hand, sent a good quality bus to pick us up from the Medina, provided us with a great morning of riding the bikes and everyone was really nice and really friendly to us!

The experience was fantastic - the scenery is beautiful and the company was flexible enough to let me and my partner rent one bike and take turns driving. We had some great vistas, enjoyed tea and pastilles at a local village, and were taken good care of by the two guides who helped us along the way. Small added touches - like the free provision of parkas to shield our clothes from the dust, free transfers from our accommodation, and a high pressure air blow-down afterwards to take the dust off our pants/shoes/bags - were appreciated and set this experience apart from the rest. All in all a great experience and one I will remember forever!"

The desert tour turned out to be the best thing we did in Morocco. Blue sky, rugged horizons, structures that look like they just appeared out of the desert sands, nice people, and life ticking on by - without running water and electricity - as it has for centuries. We walked through villages where everything was going on on the street: from metalworking to whisker shaving. We paid a little extra to visit the inside of a family's home, and saw mum making bread in her dark, smoky little kitchen. The trip invoked all that was good about the old way of doing things - and that atmosphere made it all the easier to interact with other travelers, too. Well-organized, well-conducted, well worth it - in fact, a must-do."

And the van that took us around was very new and nice, and we were lucky that people in the group were very nice and fun. So we had a fabulous time. Our tour guide was awesome: Yusaf! They will not take you to go shopping nor anything like that and they won't even ask you for tips, but since the whole tour was so nice, we did tip the guide & the driver. We had a really great time! Camel ride was so fun but a bit painful to be honest, and sleeping in the tent could be cold (make sure you dress warm and highly recommend you to bring your own warm sleeping bag, too bad I didn't). Also, make sure you wear gloves, warm scarf, tuque (warm hats) and above all, warm socks and even probably hiking boots or shoes that keep you warm.

            "review": "Fabulous tour - worth every cent. On our recent visit to Marrakech, we shopped around for a two night three day tour of the desert. There are many tour operators in the Medina around the Djema El Fena. Everyone quoted the standard 950 dirhams for the three day tour which included one night at a hotel, one night in the desert, breakfast & dinners. Some would reduce it to 900. Now it was a question of choosing the best operator. We decided to go with Hilali tours as he seemed more genuine and offered to provide me with a 4WD instead of the normal camel trek to the sand dunes as I had a bad back. I was a bit skeptical about this as most others refused to make any commitments about providing a 4WD.The next morning Mohammed arrived to our apartment promptly at 7 A.M and drove us to his office where a bigger vehicle awaited us. It was a fourteen seater which was filled up with others some of whom had booked the tour with other operators & some with Hilali tours. The driver Mr Youseff was a very nice gentleman who always made sure that everyone was comfortable. He couldn't speak English but spoke through another French speaking interpretor. My husband who was sitting at the rear end of the vehicle was suffering from travel sickness and Youseff would enquire every now & then if he should stop the vehicle and then he moved him to the front which really helped.After visiting Ourzazate, Ait Ben Haddou, the Kasbahs & the rose valley we stopped at a nice hotel for the night. Each of us were allocated a nice room with attached bath and a comfortable bed. The dinner was superb, the best chicken couscous that I've eaten, followed by fruit which was followed by plenty of music & dance entertainment by the staff of the hotel.The following morning after a lovely breakfast at the hotel we took off on the tour. We visited the Berber villages walking through a farm to the carpet weaving Berber co- operative where we were shown how carpets are woven, a couple of members purchased some lovely carpets & we moved on. Stopped for lunch at a nice place and after a lovely drive stopping and visiting some more attractions we reached our Merzouga hotel where we were refreshed with Mint tea. A string of camels awaited for the rest of the passengers in our van and as promised a 4WD awaited me. We took off to the sand dunes. The 4WD got stuck once in the sand and I had to walk a bit while the others came along on their camels. We got their at sunset, watched the sunset and sat around the tents on low round tables lit with lamps. A delicious tagine dinner and fresh fruit was served. Very romantic, very beautiful! Again we were entertained with some music on the drums. Then we were all shown our tents. Bedding & warm blankets were provided, we crept in & slept well. Next morning at 6 A.M we returned to the hotel for a nice breakfast. We took a taxi from Risani arranged by Youseff and left for Meknes while the rest of the group returned to Marrakech.All in all it was a very beautiful & most comfortable tour which was worth every dirham.Most highly recommended.Merzouga"

A driver picked us up from the riad, we had a quick safety briefing when we got there, paid and got on our quad-bikes. It was fun driving up and down hills, in mud (yeah you will get dirty), gravel and soil, and having mint tea in a berber house was a nice touch. The guys there are really nice and professional. Highly recommended!"

We had a really nice guide named Mohammed who knows the area really well and he was really safe. I saw so many little humble Berber villages which allows me know what it is like outside the buzzling centre of Marrakech. They seem to be very friendly people, everyone flag a hand when we pass, the women were courteous and put a smile when we need to pass. I also saw so many sheeps (the main meat in Morocco other than chicken) and donkeys, they are the cutest thing!! We had lunch midday in one of the villages and I truly had the best chicken tagine there compared to the one I had the night before in the famous touristy restaurant. It made me want to learn how to cook it!.My only criticism is that I wish my nice guide speaks more English as I would love to ask him many questions. But he was wonderful, caring and really tried to communicate regardless :)I also think that tourst should be reminded that the trip will be in the rock dessert instead of smooth sand dunes as i think many misunderstood :)Overall experience is great and i would come back for more"

The \"desert\" we were taken to did not have endless, smooth peaks of orange sand. It was more like a dried up, deserted area right out of Marrakech before you hit the mountains. The tour guide (who spoke very little English) took us to a Berber village in the \"desert\". The second we climbed down from our camels, we were swarmed by children from the ages of 3-10 begging for money. They kept pulling at my arm to get my attention which made me feel uncomfortable. We walked into the village and had a small snack prepared by one of the women who lives in the village. She made us Moroccan tea and grilled crepes. This was a great experience. She was so nice and it was quite interesting to see how they lived. After we finished, we went to get back on the camels where we were again bombarded by the children begging for money. It was raining so the \"desert\" became quite muddy and the camels had a hard time getting back on to their feet (took a good 20 minutes). Our tour guide got into a squabble with one of the locals and I had no idea what going on but they were about to throw punches! The local kid even picked up a large rock and went after our tour guide (he never ended up hitting him). Obviously, no one understood what the disagreement was about but it was quite scary as this went on for a good 10 minutes. I must say, our tour guide was definitely trying to diffuse the situation but it still made all of us on the tour uneasy. We finally got all of our camels to their feet and headed back to home base. The tour lasted about 3-3 1/2 hours. Overall, I give the experience 3 out 5. The poor weather was out of anyone's control but the disappointing \"desert\" and unexpected squabble during our tour was a turn off. The camels were also rather dirty. Was it a once in a life time experience...definitely. Do I regret doing this tour...no. But there are probably other desert camel rides that can top this!"

I would recommend these guys for activities as they are much better than other companies doing similar things. As an example, we went on a buggy ride with another company (I think their name was 'Touareg') and their service was poor compared to Dunes; the people were unfriendly and the ride was very boring.Thanks and enjoy."

I was particularly mesmerized by the colour on the doors and wished that we could have stopped at some places and took pictures, but the team was big and so could not, which is understandable.The hospitality offered was very good also."

Communication and payment of the deposit was easy and emails were responded to quickly. Whilst the primary European language spoke in Marakech is French, communication in English was excellent.They sent a driver to pick us up at a local supermarket, far easer than trying to find our riad, who was very friendly and informative. After arriving at the village on the outskirts of Marrakesh where the quads were based, we were given a drink of tea.As it looked like it might rain we were kitted out with waterproofs; while these were not very attractive they were comfortable and kept us warm (it didn't rain). It's worth pointing out that even if you are hot sitting around, don't underestimate the cooling effect of being on the move, sometimes at quite a good speed. Also your feet can get muddy and no gloves are supplied.We were two on one quad, pilot and passenger, and after a briefing and basic competence test we were off, following the tracks that cris cross the scrubland and we're rocky desert beyond. Our route took us through a palmeri and through several Berber villages to a small hill for a water stop (cool mineral water supplied). After meeting some local children, taking some photos and the opportunity to take in the landscape from this raised viewpoint. We set off again using a different route back towards the base, stopped off at a very basic Berber house where we were served tea and honey drizzled pancakes and had the opportunity to see how they live in these remote villages. We then returned to base and were driven back to our pickup point.The quads were quite powerful but stable and very simple to drive, even two up, with plenty of room for the passenger. All in all a thoroughly enjoyable morning and a great way to see the 'countryside' around the city and to do something a little different."

I contacted 'Dunes & Desert Exploration' through the internet and had a very helpful correspondence with them (options ranging from a single tandem flight up to a full week training course). We were picked up close to our Riad by Marc at 8:30 AM and driven to the take off location some 40 km outside Marrakech where we met with the very experienced instructors and other 'students'.I made a well guided solo flight and a instruction tandem flight until 1:00 PM. Time for a fantastic lunch with a local family, close to the flying spot. Due to thermic conditions less suitable for inexperienced flyers, we stayed at the house until 4:00 PM. Wind conditions became unsuitable for further flying and did not improve so we left the flying spot at approximately 18:00 PM. This is typical for paragliding, you have to have some luck with the weather, which is overall very suitable for paragliding at this location.Make sure you take water, sunscreening stuff, a pair of jeans, a cap/hat and suitable shoes (and gloves when you're flying) and you're all set for fine day away from the crowds in Marrakech."

They were a little late in picking us up but otherwise the journey to their base was smooth enough. The quad bikes worked perfectly and you could really pick up some speed in parts of the desert terrain - it gets REALLY dusty so wear some old clothes and be prepared. They provided mineral water which was very welcome.Highlight: driving through several tiny settlements in the middle of the desert - quite incredible to witness adults and children living in such harsh conditions. This really was authentic and having pancakes and tea in a local's home gives you a glimpse of what their homes are like.Gripe: quite expensive because Marrakesh is generally really cheap."

The local people were kind enough to allow us into their homes along the way for a traditional tea and something to eat. Quad biking was a big part of this adventure but by no means the only memories we will take home.This is an experience in Marrakech that you must do!!"

Just what I was hoping for and the best value for money trip/thing we did in Marrakech.My female friend was not convinced when I booked this (I did the panning) She\u2019s a very short Asian girl and insisted being booked as a passenger on my bike rather than driving her own. (Probably for the best as she\u2019s an awful driver!) As soon as we started she loved it, and was taking photographs as we drove along, though I wouldn\u2019t do this as her camera is clogged with dust and probably dangerous. By the end she was hanging on round my waist as we where going faster.The bikes where good standard, wet clutch, automatics, witch I found very easy to drive. Quite large, enough power, good tyres etc. (My friends parents own a farm so I\u2019ve driven geared one's before). If you\u2019re generally a good driver I don\u2019t think you would have any problems with these automatics.We got the helmets provided and a safety talk and description on how to drive etc. Then a slow drive doing zig zags so they could check we got it. Started at moderate speed, then got faster as the trip went on. To quite a fast speed. The other people on our trip where a group of French lads about the same age as us. Guessing they tailor the speed to the group as I read other peoples reviews on here before we went who took kids etc and seemed to enjoy it. We probably got up to 40-50mph at some points, at least it felt that fast, though also felt safe with the guides, the 2 guys where very good. Obviously slowing right down for villages, pedestrians, etc.The trek itself was good, driving on sand, through dried river beds, at bit of disserted gravel road, through villages etc. We stopped for a drink of water on a small rocky hilltop with great views. Then a small baber house for mint tea and a crepe/pancake thing. The 2 instructors nipped of to pray, while we where there. Which wasn\u2019t awkward at all and we just chatted between our selves for what seemed like a couple of minutes. Good bit of culture actually. Then back to base. We got to see a number of villages and a taste of what its really like in these small hamlets/villages in the dessert and all the little kids waving etc at you.Just a warning - you get quite dusty, I would book this towards the end of your trip, so you can just wash your clothes when you get back. I wore thin cargo/combat trousers and a long sleeved t-shirt.Did Marrakech by air in the morning which was also very, very good, and would recomend that as well, though its more pricey."

We were given a demonstration of the Quad bikes before being issued with a snood, helmet & goggles. The guide got the three of us to follow him so that he could see we was comfortable on the bikes. What then followed was a really enjoyable ride through the desert, as the guide could see we were doing ok we picked the speed up, which was excellent! I was at the back of the four and there was dust everywhere which only heightened the sensation of speed. We stopped up a steep incline for a cold drink before setting off again. Going through the small villages was a real contrast to the hustle and bustle of the City. We then stopped for tea, pancakes & a chat at a locals house. We continued our journey through the desert before reaching base. The bikes were in great condition & the guides couldn't have been more helpful. We was then given a air-hosing down before being dropped back off at our apartment. The whole day was fantastic, just remember to wear old clothes as they will end up covered in red dust.One note for the Dunes & Desert team, they should consider a photo service where you can purchase photos of the day as it was difficult getting pics on the move. I would have definitely bought some action shots!I would 100% recommend this trip, the best thing I did in Marrakech.Danny"

Or u can do it behind some cactus.My wife ride behind me as a passenger and both of us thoroughly enjoyed it. At the half-way point where we had water, we switched and she became the pilot.

I have ridden quad bikes from a young age and was a little worried at the start that the pace would be a little too slow and boring, but we were soon speeding through the sand dunes and at some points I was even struggling to keep up! The route that we took was really interesting and combined rock desert terrain with tracks through the villages. We stopped to take photos at about half way and then on the way back stopped in one of the villages for some mint tea and pancakes...a lovely way to finish a great morning. All in all a great trip although don't expect to be riding the quads for a full half day - in total it was more like 2 hours plus the stops, transfers and instruction etc. TIP - take some sweets with you if you want to be very popular with the local children who will want to stop and 'high five' you as you pass the villages."

Even before we left the UK, I had booked the half day quad biking excursion into the rock desert for both of us. I paid the deposit over the internet, and paid the remaining balance on the day of the excursion. I have driven quad bikes many times in the UK, and was really looking forward to the experience of driving them through the desert. I was not let down!!We were collected from our hotel (Riu Tikida Palmaraie) by two genuinely nice guys named Marc and Omar. Both of these guys had a fluent grasp of the English language and the conversation flowed between us all the way to our destination. Once there, we were given a brief safety talk, and were supplied with helmets, balaclavas and goggles for our own protection.20 minutes or so into the excursion, we were divided into 2 groups. The group I was placed into contained just four riders (me, my girlfriend and another couple), whilst the other group was slightly larger (a few of whom were younger people sharing a quad bike with their parents). Each group was given their own instructor/guide and the two groups took their seperate routes.We stopped a couple of times throughout the morning for water, and were even treated to mint tea with pancakes and honey during our second stop.Once the excursion had finished, we were able to have a quick wash from all the dust, and we were returned to our hotel without a problem.On the whole, it was a great experience and I would definitely recommend this company to anyone! Both myself and my girlfriend felt as though we had been well looked after and were treated fantastically well by all of the personnel involvedI would gladly repeat this experience and would use this company again if i ever decided to return to Marrakech."

We were then given the opportunity of trying them out before we started the excursion, and were divided into 2 groups. We were with a young couple, plus the instructer, so there were 6 of us in total. The other group had some younger children in it, and I assume they must have been passengers rather then drivers. They took a different route. We got up some good speeds and although I have no idea how fast we were going, it was fast enough and very exillerating. We stopped half way on a high point and took off our helmets, were offered water by the guides and took some photos. We had passed through a lot of villages on the way, and it was interesting to see the traditional way of life, that was evident even though we were only passing through.Stopped off at a local house for pancakes with honey and mint tea. The other group were already there. Overall it was great, and I would definitely recommend this company and the excursion. Even though I'd never quad biked before it was great and I loved it.

The country side was beautiful, the quad bikes machines were in excellent shape, we stopped in a Moroccan house made of clay and the people were very friendly, etc.We had lot of fun with my friends and the guides. They don't speak perfect English but we could easily communicate with them and that was great because we learned little beth of Arabic.I give them the best rate because it was easy to book on Internet, the organization was perfect and the excursion was great.That's the best I did in Marrakech! Don't miss it!"

So very glad that we did. The cost was about \u00a3100 per person less to be a passenger. We were given full protective gear. One of our members realized that she felt a little claustrophobic with the full helmet. So she was given a half helmet. They were brilliant with her. We set off after full instructions were given. We were then given about a 15 minute lesson to make sure that we were happy with driving the Quad. we drove for about an hour then stopped and admired the views and drank some water. Set off again and drove for about another hour then we stopped in small village. Here we met some of the locals. One very kind lady saw how hungry one of our daughters were and brought out some Paw Paw Fruits and bread. We were amazed they were so friendly. So we stopped for a bit and chatted to the locals. We took some sweets with us and handed these out they went down a storm!!! We were also provided with a chocolate bar which delighted our kids no end!After some more time driving we stopped to have lunch. To be honest when we booked this the kids were a little unsure about this part!!!The family could not have been anymore welcoming. There were many bottles of water and cola to hand. We ate a small salad and bread. Which we first thought was the lunch but turned out to be the starter!! We were then given a very very large dish of Cous Cous chicken and vegetables. This was very tasty delicious. Then We were brought a selection of melons. Finally mint tea to finish!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! We were amazed with the food.We thought that the conversation might be a little difficult. But we had such a laugh with them. They made us all very welcome in their family home. Thank so very much for letting us share that experience with your family! PS sorry about spilling the coke!! PPS Sophie still hungry!!! She never stops that girl...We finished the trip back at base about 4.30pm. What an amazing day. We were so very well looked after. WE had one guide to our party of five. He was brilliant. I felt a little sick due to the heat it was in the 40`s but he made sure that we had regular stops, that I had plenty of water and felt ok. We also stopped at natural springs which was a welcome relief. Great to paddle in, very cool and refreshing.We went over varied terrain. From very rough to some roads. Never did we get board, this has to be one of the most amazing experiences that we have ever had. They don't speak much English but the do try very very hard. You will pleasantly surprised. We had no credit card to pay before we got there. but they met us at the hotel and took a deposit. paid the rest on the day. We looked at quad biking when we got home. But to be honest we wont be doing it here. we paid \u00a3100 for the day back in England \u00a369.00 for ONE HOUR!!! We would go back any-day and try the rest of the trips. Well worth the money. DON'T BOOK WITH THE HOTELS THEY CHARGE \u00a365.00 FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS!! NO WHERE NEAR AS MUCH FUN!!PLEASE CONTACT US TO ASK ANY QUESTIONS WE WOULD BE HAPPY TO HELPLISA AND ADAM BOOTHlisalashes123@hotmail.co.ukWE CANT THANK YOU ENOUGH FOR THE BEST TIME THAT WE HAVE EVER HAD WE WILL BE BACK!!!!!!!!!!!"

Picked up on time in air con mini bus. Quad bikes, safety equipment and safety briefing all first class. Duration was about three hours with stops for drinks and a snack, well over two hours driving, my older teenage kids loved it. Guides were helpful and really friendly.Highlight of the holiday. Would do full day next time.Camels were a little bit disappointing after that. Was ok and probably worth doing, It was a busy day and took ages to get everyone on board. About 90 mins on the camel and again stopped for drink and snack with the locals. Take some water with you on this one, as unlike the quad ride, none was supplied. Would definitelyuse this company again."

It was absolutely the best day of our trip and we couldn't recommend it enough!! The team picked us up from our hotel and took us to their base (which was a great adventure in itself!!) then we had a whole morning on the bikes- travelling through nearby villages, stopping off for tea and traditional pastries, and experiencing the breathtaking desert. The team were all very good fun, and the amount of time we spent on the quads was exceptionally good value for money- all in all a superb morning!We then were taken back to our hotel by the team and then collected for the afternoon session of camel riding. Getting dressed in traditional clothing added to the experience, and once again the guide was great fun. Again, a great price for the amount of time we got to spend on the camel, riding through the desert!Anyone planning a trip to Marrakesch must book a trip with Dunes and Desert- great value for money, great team and overall a really great experience!We look forward to using you guys again if we ever plan another trip to Morocco!Fatima and Mohammad(!)"

Did the half day quad excursion and it was a fun experience driving through the Palmeraie and the Berber villages. There are stretches of the route where you can go at a (relatively) high speed and get REALLY dusty (where you can't see a thing but the dust cloud in front of you created by the quad in front) but it all added to the thrill and fun of the ride! The only minus for me was that the 'guide' didn't speak any English and so it was a purely driving experience for me which can get a bit boring without someone explaining along the way. Would have been much better if the guide at least speaks 'some' English and was able to provide basic information when we stopped at various points on the way."

Even though we only had a 24 hour excursion planned, our itinerary was packed full and seemed twice as long as what it was. Here is what our group did so you can get an idea of what you can expect (although there are many options to choose from!):In the morning, we were picked up from the airport in two SUVs. Our luggage was secured to the top and wrapped in rain-proof tarps, so no worries for the rest of the trip. Our first leg was driving up through the ancient villages in the hills, on our way to the tallest point of civilization in Morocco. The scenery along the way was amazing and the guides provided an excellent history and cultural lesson to give us more context around what we were seeing. Upon arrive to the Atlas mountain village we took donkeys up to the highest point in the village. I probably wouldn't ride donkeys again because I'm a pretty large guy, but it was a very unique experience! Lunch was served on the roof of the highest point of the village with stunning views of the Atlas mountains and the villages below. Food was excellent and everything was served very traditionally.More driving through fantastic scenery brought us to a sunset camel ride (with the largest camels I've ever seen). We rode right to the tent compound where we were to spend the night. The compound was amazing, and we were treated like royalty. All food was included but drinks were purchased if needed. There were wood buring fires and a whole courtyard for us to hang out in all night if we wanted (it was a private compound to our group of 10). The tents were extremely luxurious and more than what we expected. The next morning we had breakfast and a quick visit to a nearby village family to learn a little bit about the typical living conditions and family life. We ended the tour with some off roading in the surrounding dunes - a great way to wrap things up. Then we were dropped off right near our hotel. Perfect.One of the best parts about the tour was Mark and his crew. He and his team of 3 others made the trip easy, comfortable, and exciting - everything you want with an organized tour. We never had to lift a finger, everything was taken care of. The best part is that he and his wife Paule who organized our trip, accompanied us at dinner a couple nights later when we were staying in downtown Marrakech. That is a great indicator of guides that truely care about giving their customers a personal and amazing experience, not just making a living. So...get outside of the souks and city walls and experience all that surrounding Morocco has to offer - a trip to Marrakech is not complete without it!"

While I did not make the reservation myself I can say that they were very professional in handling the reservation. We were picked up by a small bus from our hotel in Marrakech. The drive took no more than 20 minutes and got us in the middle of nowhere until we noticed a large number of quads standing outside the building. We got a quick lesson in handling the quads and got all the proper materials (helmet, goggles,facemask <-- these were all washed properly!!) needed for the trip. We started slow to get aqcuainted with the quads. And after 10 minutes we were already underway.I will not spoil the entire trip. The greatest element of the trip is to get to know all these exciting surroundings & people in an awesome way. We had 2 instructors with us driving along and maintaining the pace. In the beginning some persons were slowing the group down. The instructor noticed this and separated us in a faster and a slower group and we got off to a better start. The instructors were very, very kind and made the tour that much better to enjoy.I highly recommend Dunes & Desert to anyone who wants a welcome distraction from the souks. I must however emphasize that the Quad trip is not meant for the sole purpose of racing. You will have moments with some serious speed, but all in all it is a trip meant for discovering the beautiful surroundings the trip has to offer."

To be fair, that might well be the case, maybe I was in a bad group. I've ridden an ATV 15-20 times before, and although no expert I'm used to other motorized vehicles and prefer speed. I was travelling with 3 others who had never ridden an ATV before, and whilst the scenery was amazing and the guides were really good the lack of speed really killed it for me. I would advice you to ask them to be in an advanced group, and if that's not possible to maybe contact another company. I realize a lot of the way is riding through villages and crossing places were animals and small kids are, but a long portion of the allows for full-throttle driving but on this trip it simply was not possible.Oh, and I was on the 1/2 trip."

Their joy was infectious and the best part of the trip to Morocco was the part we spent with them, in their care. The drivers (separate from the Guides) were very friendly and professional, and excellent drivers (relatively smooth rides over rough roads). Marc was full of suggestions, even helping us book a dinner (for when we returned to Marrakech) at a very good, traditional restaurant.

            "review": "Run Your Business Professionally. My fiance and I had scheduled two excursions with Dunes & Desert, one horseback riding and the other a quad excursion. When the driver came to pick us up for the horseback riding excursion, he told us that we had to pay $1,125 dollars immediately. This was of course $1000 more than what we were supposed to pay. After about 15 minuets of back and forth gestures (the driver spoke neither French or English) we were on our way. The horseback riding turned out to be a pleasurable experience.For the second excursion, we wanted to pay by credit card in order to avoid the same issues we had the previous day. We asked if we could come to the office and pay there. We were told that this was not an option because their TPE machine was not working and the only other option available was to pay n cash. We then cancelled the excursion well in advance of the scheduled rendez-vous. However, again there was a lack of communication and the driver came to pick us up. We obviously did not show because we had cancelled. We received a nasty email from someone and Dunes blaming us for making the driver and the other guests wait for thirty minuets. This is obviously not a business run by professionals. The individuals charged with dealing with clients should be polyglot and they should have the capacity in place to accept various types of payment methods. Communication between office staff and field staff should be improved to avoid any complications in dealing with clients. Furthermore, office staff should regularly check emails and other communications in order to avoid any inconvenience."

We booked a half day (9am pick up until about 1pm) quad biking excursion through dunes and desert at the end of November 2010. The only negative is that I wish we had booked a longer trip.The guys that organise it are French speaking but emailed details in English with no problem. Our guide on the day was French speaking so I would recommend brushing up before going although he spoke some English.I was nervous about this initially so only booked a half day but I would recommend going for longer. We rode a quad bike each although you have the option of being a passenger as well. Goggles, helmets and overclothes are provided - It gets extremely dusty and can be chilly once up to speed so I would take them up on the offer! Take a backpack with a camera, gloves, water, tissues (just in case!) and maybe extra warm clothing too in the winter. Wear warm layers and sensible shoes!We stopped at a Berber village for sweet mint tea and pancakes for a short while. The terrain is quite desolate but once up on the hills you get amazing views and winding between palm trees and Berber villages is still an experience not to be missed. Children run out to wave and you pass the occasional donkey carrying goods on the roads too."

I would highly recommend using this company for booking any trips in Morocco as every aspect of the trip was amazing. Even if you can find a tour cheaper from a local company, spend a little more and book the right trip with this company. We had our own 4x4 with a great guide. Drove by hundreds of tour buses and vans with tourist who probably paid a little less money and were crambed into a bus or van that couldn't do any of the off roading to the better destinations. Every restaurant that we stopped at (pre-arranged) and accomodation we used were outstanding. They have done their research and only use the best options available. We even had a question midway through our tour and they were avaiable by phone and email to help in making sure our experience was everything we hoped it would be.Don't waste your time looking anywhere else. Book your tours with this company.Liam (Canadian traveller)"

We chose to do the day trip to Imlil and Atlas mountains, which for me was unforgetable. It was about 2-hour trip each way, by our personal driver Abdul and then about 45-min with the donkey to a Berber village. We were headed straight to a restaurant in the middle of the mountain with awesome views! They served lamb tagine, which according to my husband was really delicious! Unfortunately I'm vegetarian, so didn't eat any of it, which would probably be one of my criticisms, as they could've checked dietary requirements. But I definetely recommend doing this trip!We also went to Essaouira to do quad biking in the dunes, and this was the highlight of our trip! 3 hours of riding the bikes up and down the dunes, including a couple of really steep ones, which tested our bravery and was an adrenaline rush.The last activity Dunes and Desert organized was paragliding, which was a great experience. The whole experience might seem a little short (10-20 mins) for the money paid and is not for the faint-hearted, but the duration apparently depends on weather conditions. Paragliding is done in tandem with the highly trained and experienced Michel Didriche.All in all I was really impressed by how they organized every detail of the trip starting from Paule's attentive correspondence and organization, to the restaurants they chose for us, our driver Abdul... etc. Our Moroccan trip was quite short but I'm really happy that Marc and Paule made it worthwhile!"

He took us to some small villages to know the way the people live in there. We even visited a traditional home and had fresh mint tea with pancakes.The following day we took a day trip to Ourika valley. Our guide Andy was awesome. He stayed with us all the time.

But we decided to go for a package and after reading Tripadvisor reviews, decided to go with Morocco Key Travel. Right from planning our trip to saying our farewells at the airport, it was an excellent experience. We interacted with Youssef for planning the trip. We had done a fair amount of research to know where we wanted to go and in which order and Youssef managed to put it all together perfectly. We are vegetarians and requested him to ensure we got something to eat!We were picked up at Casablanca airport by Youssef's brother Ibrahim in a Toyota Land Cruiser that was to become our second home for the next 9 days. Ibrahim is warm, friendly and eager to show tourists the best his country has to offer. It seems he knows everybody everywhere and they know him too! He loves Indian music and we alternated between listening to Moroccan and Indian music throughout our journey, learning and teaching whatever we knew!The hotels chosen were very good and in very good locations. We weren't exactly thrilled with a couple of them, but they were mostly very good. Ibrahim chose very knowledgeable, friendly guides speaking decent English and they gave us good tours with interesting perspectives on what we saw. The highlight of our trip was the camel ride and night in a luxury tent among the Erg Chebbi dunes. It was also oddly the place where we had our best and most authentic Moroccan meal of the entire trip! End of July - early August is not the best of times to visit Morocco (it was 48 deg C in Marrakech!) but the advantage is that there are no crowds anywhere!"

After a couple hours of driving he treated us to a Berber omelet for breakfast. We drove for hours making several stops on our way up to the Central High Atlas mountains. The views were breathtaking and pictures that we took do no justify the beauty. When then visited A\u00eft Benhaddou. After this we we were taken to our hotel Auberge Chez Pierre, this was picked out by Youseff and is gem with lots of character. That evening we were served a 5 course dinner followed by live entertainment by hotel staff and our driver Ibrahim joined also.Day 2: Explored Dades and Todgha Gorge before heading to the desert. We rode camels to our camp and were greeted with snacks and mint tea. We stayed in a luxury tent and had running water and flushing toilet (bonus). We later enjoyed dinner and singing and playing instruments with Youseff, Ibrahim and Mubarak.Day 3: 4x4 through the sand dunes...so much fun. Youseff and a different driver drove us back to our hotel in Marrakech.Something that really stood out to us is on day 3 Youseff was feeling very ill but he still accompanied us back to Marrakech. He ended up getting sick but he did not let that get in the way of our experience. We admire his dedication.When he dropped us to our hotel, he offered to drop us to the airport the following day. This was not in our original plans and he did not even charge us any extra money for this. A very kind gesture on his part.Thank you Youseff and Ibrahim. We had a great time with you two!"

During these 11 days, i explored maze-like medinas in Fez and Meknes,Sipping traditional mint tea at Kasbah of Rabat, riding camel at sunset in Sahara desert, enjoying Morroco hammam in a beautiful Riad. My driver and guide was Brahim, he is so experienced and hospitality. Each place I had excellent accommodation and they also arranged me excellent English guides in Fes, Meknes,Marakesh and other places I visited. One of the highlight from my trip to Morroco was camping in the Sahara Desert, I could never forget the night silence desert, the moment when the tranquil and peaceful desert at night gradually engulf me, I feel like I can even touch those stars.. I feel a great sense of peace, just sitting there and being in nature. We arrived at the camp in Erg Chebbi right around dusk,the tent was so comfortable and clean, there is a bathroom with hot water inside the camp. Also There is a separate dining-salon tent with beautiful decoration.The dinner was traditional tagine with different salads, it's so delicious.At night, the campfire was lit, Brahim and the staff sang traditional Berber songs with their drums.I really enjoyed it.

If you are traveling in Morocco for a few days or a few weeks, you should work with Youssef and trust him to provide you with the best trip of your life. That is exactly what we did and we walked about with an incredible experience in an amazing country.Our family group of six adults traveled with Youssef\u2019s guide Mohammed for two weeks around the Christmas and New Year\u2019s holidays. We worked with Youssef for months via email to create the trip, adjust it, understand what we would be doing and finalize details. He was very responsive, accommodating, and patient.We had some dietary and medical needs that we need to take into consideration and without hesitation Youssef and Mohammed addressed those for us before and during the trip. This helped us enjoy the experience and not worry about issues like that.The jewel of the trip was our journey to Youssef\u2019s new desert camp in Erg Chebbi. It is at the camp that you understand how deep Youssef\u2019s commitment to hospitality goes. He created and built the camp for the specific use and enjoyment of his guests. Each cabin/tent contains lights, bathroom, shower and running water. It is staffed by a group of young men who tend to all your needs. They cook incredible meals, ensure that you are awake for the sunrise, get you to the camp and back via camel or 4x4.While at the camp you really separate from the day to day of your home, as well as even the medium and big cities of Morocco. You see more stars than you thought were possible, you have different food, sit around a fire, watch amazing sunrises and sunsets.Youssef matches you with a guide who speaks your language, but each guide speaks five to seven languages. Youssef met us at the start of the trip and then again in Marrakesh \u2013 about halfway through the trip. He was always available via phone, email or text in the event we had questions or concerns \u2013 our guide Mohammed was so good we only emailed Youssef to tell him all was going well.When you are in country and you see other groups, you realize the small things that Youssef and his team do that separate them from the other groups. His vehicles are newer, nicer, and more comfortable. The riads are a little more personal. The local guides are step up from the rest.In each of the big cities we traveled to Youssef would arrange for a local guide with good English skills and local knowledge to lead us on a walking tour around the city. These were some of the most eye opening and enjoyable experience. The guides were incredibly knowledgeable and patience, taking us as fast or as slow as we wanted, answering all our questions. Helping us take photos, etc.On a final note, Morocco is an incredibly kind, generous, warm and welcoming country. The people you meet are genuinely interested in you enjoying your time and learning. There are lots of stops (if you want them) at local craft shops \u2013 carpets, spices, metal, wood, linens, oil. You can or cannot purchase from each of these vendors, Youssef\u2019s guides make sure you don\u2019t feel unnecessary pressure. We found at each stop a connection and deeper understanding of Morocco.This trip would not have been possible without Youssef\u2019s dedication to our enjoyment. He does request a deposit to offset some of reservation costs in advance and cash payment upon arrival. You should not feel any concern wiring him the money via Western Union or another service and paying for the trip upfront. This is all done so you have the best trip possible."

We always felt like we were in good hands whether it was checking in at the hotel or stopping at a local restaurant for food. (Aminah from Riad El Ma in Meknes provided a wonderful first impression of the hospitality we would receive for the rest of our trip - sincere and warm). The best part of our trip was the 3 days & 3 nights spent in the desert. The people at the hotel and campsite made us feel right at home, and seemed happy to welcome Ibrahim as well, which is always a good sign. We also met with Youssef at Ait Ben Haddou, who was friendly and checking in to ensure all was going well. We've had a couple of not-so-pleasant encounters with some sellers in the souks / tourist spots, but this was in our own time and suffice to say, we know better now. We came as tourists but departed as friends, thanks to the kind hospitality of Ibrahim and the people we've met along the way.

E-mails we answered almost instantly. Our driver, Ibrahim, was not only a knowledgable guide, but he was also a very easy travel companion. He offered some last minute changes while on the road to allow us to adapt our schedule on the fly. I could not believe how carefree that made us feel. We saw amazing sights, met interesting people from a fascinting new culture to us, and now have a new freind in Morocco. When we left, my daughter left her camera in the car, and they express mailed it to us before we new it was missing. I very strongly recommend Morocco Key Travel to anyone planning a trip to this special destination. My wife and I have very busy schedules, and MKT made planning a trip and customizing it to our interests simple. Thanks for the great memories Youseff & Ibrahim!!!"

My friend and I from Australia ( we are women in our 50s ), had an amazing trip over 5 days from Fez to the desert at Merzouga and then through the Dades valley over the Atlas Mountains to Marrakech. Ibrahim, our driver, was knowledgable about the desert as that is where he is originally from, and so we saw some great sights from music to markets to kasbahs and beyond. We stayed two nights in the desert and that was a highlight for us especially riding in on camels at sunset. The Dades Valley was also fantastic. The places we stayed that Morroco key Travel had chosen for us were excellent. The rooms were great as was the food and not to expensive for our budget. A couple of places had swimming pools and that was also a bonus. Ibrahim our driVer and guide made travelling for us easy and fun. He was always cheerful and observant of our needs. He was a great driver and very safe. We wouldn't hesitate to take a trip with Moroccan Key Travel again. Amazing insight into some aspects of Moroccan life. Thankyou Youssef and Ibrahim!"

            "review": "nicely planned private tour. After looking into how to plan our trip to Morocco, my friend and I decided to use Morocco Key Travel to take us from Marrakesh to the surrounding areas (Atlas Mountains, Sahara, etc). Though our entire email chain was with Youssef, the Key Travel manager I believe, our actual guide for the 4 days, 3 nights trip was Ibrahim, Youssef's brother. The customized tour follows a similar route to those of other guide services in the area, but we had Ibrahim as our driver in a private 4x4 vehicle for the whole time which was really great. That meant stopping as frequently (or not) as we wanted. Plenty of gorgeous landscape to view en route to each \"larger\" attraction. Ibrahim spoke great English and was fun and energetic. He knew everyone we were staying with and arranged for a tour of the Ait-Ben Haddou Kasbah for my friend and I. Each place we dined had nice, traditional food, the hotels (riads) we stayed at (booked by Morocco Key Travel) were clean and nicely appointed. The desert overnight in Ibrahim's family tent/desert plot was truly a must do. I wish we had a second day to spend out in the desert - talk about beautiful stars and such a different mind set from any other place on earth. I think for the money, Morocco Key Travel is definitely worth it. I attached some photos of what we saw / did during our trip."

Our trip was sort of a loop around the central part of the country. We went to Rabat, Meknes, Fes, and then out to the desert. It was the best part of the trip. We spent a night in a tent camp out in the desert. Later we met some Berber Nomads, and we had tea with them. After the desert, we went to Essaouira, then to Marrakesh. Key Travel thought of everything to make our trip more enjoyable."

I have traveled to many different countries, and I must say that going to Morocco was truly an amazing experience.Part of of the reason was our amazing guide Youssef. He took care of everything for us. We were four women traveling, and at first I was a little hesitant to to go Morocco, I had some safety concerns, traveling with my mother, my daughter and friend. I can honestly say that I felt 100% safe all the time.My favorite memory of this trip is riding camels out into the desert and spending the night in tents, let's just say luxurious tent accommodations. It was wonderful! A great night of food and entertainment in the middle of the desert, it was so peaceful.We traveled with Youssef for several days and each day was a new adventure, I really felt that we saw every aspect of Moroccan life. It is so nice when you travel to get a real understanding of the people and their customs, you feel you have a connection to that country forever.I simply can not say enough about this wonderful country and the professionalism and courtesy shown to us by Morocco Key Travel.Lastly I feel that some of the everyday conversations I had with Youssef will be with me forever he has such a great personality and is so much fun. Everything will always be \"fantastic like plastic\". Will you have your tea \"with\" or \"with out\" (meaning sugar). I drink mint tea everyday and it is always \"with\". Thank you Youssef !!!"

The company certainly deserves a five star award from trip advisor. The fairly new Toyota Landcruiser was comfortable for our four day trip. Day 1 we visited Ait Ben Haddou and Dades Gorge and stayed in a delightful hotel Chez Pierre, which delivered the most outstanding high French Cuisine, in a comfortable dining room with a lovely wood burner and very helpful staff.Day 2 we visited the Valley of the roses and Todra Gorge and continued to Erg Chebbi in time to meet our desert guide on the edge of the Sahara. Camel trekking was an experience , especially during the beautiful sunset towards the Berber nomad tented desert camp inside the dunes. The table was set, the woodfire lit, a hot shower ready and Berber music and songs filled the air by the fire. A comfortable tent and wonderful food and evening provided by Youssef and his family. Day 3. A beautiful sunrise and camel ride back through the desert to meet Youssef and our transport. We visited Draa Vally. Youssef was kindly enough to help and agree to provide passage to two girls from London in distress after a bad experience with a local taxi driver.We arrived in Ouarzazate in time for dinner and in again a stunning location. Hotel Darchamaa was certainly to be commended on its standards and comfort. Day 4Firstly we visited the Kasbash in Ouarazate than drove through Tizi N Tichka back to Marrakech. A memorable four days,(1500 km) thanks to Youssef and Morocco Key Travel. Thank you."

We have travelled extensively in Europe and Asia and our first in Africa was very memorable. Morocco Key Travel did all the planning and accommodating our requests was just perfect. Youssef's efficient planning, Ibrahim's warm welcome at MARAKKECH, Mohammed's excellent driving and Ali's historical and cultural insights of Morocco from MARAKKECH, the High Atlas to Ait Ben Haddou, the magical Dades Gorges and Gorges Todra, Quarzazate, Merzouga to Fez was first class all the way. The destinations and sites we visited were beautiful and magical. Youssef's wonderful and exciting welcome after our sunset dessert camel ride to our camp destination at Erg Chibbi was the icing on the cake. The campsite (glamsite - equipped with toilet and bath) was comfortable and well equipped. Youssef served an amazing dinner and the team also entertained us with wonderful Berber music. Every single person we encountered on this trip including the tour guides in MARAKKECH (Said) and FEZ (Kahlid) were all knowledgeable, honest, courteous, accommodating and pleasant. I highly recommend Morocco Key Travel. Shukran Youssef!"

            "review": "Moroccan Key Travel. I decided to surprise my wife with a trip to Morocco. Since we are not experienced travelers I did a search for agencies that could help me arrange the trip. I used TripAdvisor and got the name of several agencies. I emailed them for itineraries and prices and Moroccan Key Travel seemed to have the best deal, and the hotels (riads) seemed very nice. I exchanged emails with Youssef and we agreed on a price. Youssef then asked for a deposit through Western Union. This made me nervous. I asked some friends who are experienced travelers and they said that this is not uncommon. I emailed Youssef about my concerns, and he said to forget about the deposit and long as we promise to actually go. Due to his trust I decided to send the deposit. We arrived at the airport and we were greeted with a warm smile by Youssef's brother Ibrahim, who we would later address by his childhood nickname Brho. Brho is a big man with a bigger heart. We went to Rabat, Meknes, Fez, Ouarzazete, Volubilis, and our favorite, Erg Chebbi, as well as other areas. The sights, sounds and smells were all fascinating for us. Our riads were all beautiful and comfortable, particularly in Meknes, Ouarzazete and in the desert, although there was some air conditioning issues. We traveled in a large well appointed 4 wheel drive Toyota that was very comfortable. The trip was an amazing experience for us, and a big part of that was Brho. His English was sufficient for us to communicate very well, and we learned a great deal from him. We laughed a lot and enjoyed the music of Tinariwen together. He is originally from the desert area and he talked of his youth and how his heart is still there. Perhaps it was his influence but my wife and I truly loved our experience in the desert (except for my camel ride). We had a chance to spend an extra night there instead of Marrakesh and we passed it up. That was a mistake on our part. I highly recommend Moroccan Key Travel. Youssef did an amazing job and we will never forget Brho."

My wife and I were part of a group of 8 from Canada that used Morocco Key Travel to take us on a 2-week tour of Morocco from Tangier to Marrakesh stopping at Chefchaouen, Volubilis, Fez, the desert, the gorges, and Cascades d\u2019Ouzoud along the way. We travelled in a 17-seat van that allowed all of us to travel in one vehicle along with Youssef and the driver for great camaraderie. The city guides provided were excellent and we learned more than we will ever remember. The recommended riads and auberges were very good with some providing very good dinners. Moroccan food is very good but unfortunately travellers\u2019 disease caught up to us so we had to eat bland foods for a while. Youssef went out of his way to comfort us and even accompanied my wife to a clinic in Marrakesh where he was most helpful in getting medical attention. Morocco is a country of many sights and smells that appealed to us but can also surprise our western attitudes. Morocco must be seen with an open mind because Morocco is fascinating in so many different and unexpected ways. We found the people to be very friendly and felt safe wherever we went. We can recommend using Morocco Key to organize and carry out a fantastic tour of Morocco. You will not be disappointed. Many thanks to Youssef and his driver for a great trip"

Four of us started in Marrakech and then went to the Dades Gorges, the Sahara ,Fez, Rabat and finally Essaouira. From the start of the planning Youssef was extremely helpful and efficient. From meeting us at the airport onwards everything went perfectly. The various guides employed were excellent - especially the ones in Fez and Volubilis - and the riads booked for us were lovely. Ibrahim, who was our driver and guide for the whole trip after Marrakech, was brilliant - took great pains to look after us, show us as many things as possible - many of which would not have been possible I'm sure on a package-type tour - and is a great companion - good fun all the time, a safe driver and ultra reliable. We also felt that for the service and experience provided, the cost was remarkably reasonable. If you are going on an extended tour, be aware that Morocco is not a small country, and there is quite a lot of driving involved - but the Landcruiser was comfortable, reliable and air-conditioned. If we had to pick out one highlight of the tour it would probably be the 2 days in the Sahara - but having said that, the whole experience was first class. We couldn't recommend Youssef and his company more highly."

We had an action packed itinerary and a lot of driving through the Atlas mountains to the Sahara stopping at Ait Ben Haddou en route. Youseff, our guide was legendary... he made us laugh, provided amazing entertainment (essential for 2 days driving!) and was a fountain of knowledge. One of our party had travel sickness (made far worse by the Tizi n Tichka pass - although I think she will agree the views made up for it!!) and Youseff could not have been kinder, providing vital distractions - including an exceptional redition of 'Blurred Lines' at all the right times. Aside from the Atlas mountains, the highlight of the trip was most definatley the camel ride into the Sahara to stay in the desert camp. Looking out for a shooting star from a sand dune = bliss, singing some classic Berber songs after dinner was also a highlight! The silence that the desert was a huge, and welcome contrast from the hustle and bustle of Marrakech. If you are visting Morocco make sure you take a tour with these guys, superb knowledge of the country, amazing people, comfortable cars and most importantly great fun! I can honestly will be planning my next trip to Morocco shortly... perhaps Fez and more Sahara fun as suggested by Youseff."

The trip, accommodations and meals were all first rate. The 1.5 hr. camel ride to the camp site, while not entirely comfortable, was nonetheless something we have not regrets doing and provided a life-time memory for our young daughters.

It was a great, awesome trip, largely because of the travel arrangements we made with Morocco Key Travel (a 5-Day Saharan adventure and Fes, starting and ending in Marrakech)We had two weeks to organise our trip and I reached out to several of the tour groups in the trip advisor top tours list. Youssef, Morocco Key Travel's owner, was the most responsive. Although he provided a set itinerary, he was flexible to make a few changes, as we opted to get a different riad in Marrakech, but still including the airport transfers. With this itinerary, I asked the other tour groups to provide me a quote and Youssef gave me the best price. Other groups were 30% more expensive.As with the other reviews, the 4x4 vehicle was always clean and the inclusive accommodations were better than we expected. Highlights of our trip were as follows:(*) The tasty, authentic, Moroccan lunch meal we had at Youssef's friend's, in-the-middle-of-nowhere restaurant. The best we had throughout the whole trip.(*) The awesome, awesome Saharan desert experience. No bad photos there. The camels were sweet and friendly. The sunset and sunrise views were breath-taking. It all seemed like a dream. Sleeping under the stars was great too, and the berber tents were quite comfortable.(*) Best of all, the warmth, professionalism, and sense of humor of our guides, Ibrahim (Youssef's brother) and Ali. They even gave us Berber names, which brought smiles to other Moroccans we met. We had a lot of laughs during the drive and they brought us to places were the views were outstanding. It was sad to part with them, really.We highly recommend Morocco Key Travel! We felt like the value of our experience was much more than what we paid for."

            "review": "Great trip, very service oriented tour company. Recommended. Very good choice for a tour out of Marrakech. We would defintely recommend. We spent 4 days / 3 nights doing the typical trip out to Sahara via Atlas mountains, and all the sights along the way. Basics: new comfortable 4wd. Accomodation was excellent - two very nice boutique-y hotels (then at Sahara its your choice of desert camp or another hotel). Food was surprisingly good - both boutique hotels served really lovely meals (better than we found in Marrakech) and offered excellent service. Day 2 lunch was tastiest meal we ate in morocco - at a tiny out-of-the-way place off-road in the desert, run by a mate of Youssef's We found morocco key travel very professional - sending detailed suggested itineraries ahead of our trip and corresponding in very timely manner, collecting us from airport and returning us afterwards, free of charge, even though our tour with them started several days post arrival and wrapped up days before we left! Youssef (who we dealt with in booking) is incredibly enthusiastic about his business and his country - try to get him personally as the guide for your tour if you canThe morocco key travel team are SUPER service oriented. Anything you want on the tour they will organise, you just have to ask. You'll get the most out of this trip if you speak up. Ie stops for photos, for snack/drink, changing the itinerary etc - they absolutely want you do get exactly what you want from the tour - you just have to keep chatting to them. They are really flexible and really focused on your enjoyment. At one point we wanted to add some walking after a long previous day in the car - no prob, the team found us a local guide who walked us through local palm plantation (we sampled fresh dates off the tree!), and through his village - a good experience and nice change from just speeding through the main street and viewing villages from the 4wdAll in all it's a beautiful trip, the scenery was spectacular, and we would definitely recommend morocco keyHINT: if you are doing this trip, take LOTS of small notes/change with you. No-one would accept our 100 dirham notes to pay for water etc (our lovely guide, Ali, had to spot us in the end!!), and we were forever wishing we had change to buy small things/fruits from locals, for tips, and for charity"

He was extremely helpful through the whole trip, trying to please all our needs, and also giving us many info about his beautiful country. His great sense of humor, his easy going temperament and hospitality made it very easy for us to feel comfortable and spend some great times with him. He started as a guide but he became our friend. The hotels we stayed in, chosen by him, were beautiful, clean and each one having its unique traditional charateristics! Youssef stood with great professionalism, arranging all sightseeings in different cities or villages to the last detail. He drove a very comfortable and clean 4x4 Toyota and made us feel safe in every way, leaving us with no complains. Morocco Key Travel is definetely recommended!!!! Youssef thanks for everything...We're gonna miss u!!!"

            "review": "Our tour was more of a car ride from one destination to the other (marrakech-Fes). After extensive researching, and many emails with several tour companies I decided to go with this company because of the price and the assurance that we would have an english speaking tour guide. We were wrong - and the most expensive part of our trip turned out to be the worst three days of our two week trip. We were picked up (on time) from our riad in Marrakech from the driver Saeed(i think thats his name). We found it kind of odd that he didnt know english (and asked us if we knew italian or french) after I had sent several emails to youssef asking for assurance that we would get an english guide. We figured that we would be meeting the owner (who was communicating with us the whole time), but we were wrong. For a full day and a half we drove in silence (with minor comments from me in my broken grade level french). At the minimal sites we were taken to, we were given the name, and dropped off without instruction (i.e. at Ait Benhaddou we were dropped off at the street and had to go through the village's alleyways and asked other tourists to find out where to go (through the village, across the river and to the top of the kasbah on our own). Im glad I had my lonely planet book. When we finally reached the desert we were dumped on another tour group for the night. The desert trip was memorable, camel ride was awesome but VERY quickly lost the romanticism of it after it started to hurt. Sleeping in the desert was extremely cold, we had 8 blankets (which was not enough) and a hard mattress. I would not recommend this part to any one. I think it would be more enjoyable to sleep on a bed (in a heated room). Otherwise i recommend everyone to bring hat, gloves, winter jacket. Once our desert tour was over we \"ran into\" the owner. After telling him, oh you promised us an english guide - he said oh its busy time?!?!?! but then quickly said - oh i will give you an english guide now. We were willing to forget the first day and a half of silence, if this english guide proved to be good. Unfortunately he was not. Similar to our first day and a half, he had minimal knowledge, barely any conversation, and seriously my guide book gave us more insight. Our last day with this \"tour\" was miserable. Lastly I would like to add that although the breakfast and dinners are included..the lunches were always at places that were RIDICULOUSLY expensive, with disgusting food. Paying 200 dirhams per person for vegetables/bland food (when there were many less expensive/or more appetizing places nearby was quite disappointing) I believe that the driver was able to eat for free if he brought us to these places. If anyone ends up going I would recommend picking your own lunch spot (esp at Ait Benhaddou). In all, I would like to say, if you are english speaking (only) I would recommend going with another tour group. (I wish we picked the british tour group). The driver was not a guide, but he was a very safe driver and overall pleasant guy (without the talking) and took us to clean rest stops to go to the bathroom. (much appreciated). The hotel they picked (les 5 lunes) for the first night was very nice, but again freezing (no heating units). In the future when we do go back to marrakech, i will definitely be taking the train from Marrakech to Fes (reliable, comfortable, and cheap). -we paid 600 Euros for this poorly guided tour :("

We're a family of five with kids aged 15, 11 and 8 and there really was something for everyone. The absolute highlight of the tour was the time spent camping in the desert right at the base of the stunning Chigaga dunes. We sand boarded, stared up at the stars, went camel trekking and ate the most amazing food.The accommodation booked for us by Top Desert either side of the camping nights was also absolutely beautiful.

Our stay in the Toureg camp was beautiful and the consideration from our hosts was outstanding. Our driver and new friend, Abdul, took enormous care to ensure our experience was one we would never forget. He could not have been kinder or more fun to share this wonderful adventure. His sense of humor was great and we laughed throughout the 3 days we spent together.The website is quite good with very good information about the various options.

The Riad we stayed the first night was very cute and traditional, the food was nice and the host was very kind. When we arrived to the desert we had the camel trekking with sunset and time to go around the dunes which we higly enjoyed! Comfortable, private double beds in tends for the night. The food was alright and night's entertainment was great with all the guides (one more couple was there with us) playing traditional instruments to Arabic songs around a small fire and under the clear, full-of-stars sky.Clothing; 35-38C during the day, so light wearing, still warm at night even in the desert.Money; worth it for the money, not much spent for lunch (which was not included in the tour). Stops; we had frequent stops to stretch our feet/ have a coffee, to nice photo points, for lunch and whenever we felt like seeing the great landscapes on our wayThe tour; we went by UNESCO world heritage sites (kasbahs), the long palmtrees' oasis, argan oil factory, the high Atlas and anti-Atlas mountains, etc.We had an unforgettable tour, souk in the sun, landscapes and Moroccan culture.

We had some frequent stops but he stopped at resting areas with either great food or views. After a whole day of driving, we finally arrived at the camel site. We got to choose and name our camels (mine was Momo). Even though we had to trek through a sandstorm, Adil saved us all with his excellent navigation skills. We arrived at the campsite to some amazing tagine chicken for dinner. After the storm passed, the sky cleared up which was the perfect time for us to stargaze. We had a lot of fun with singing and playing their drums.What I loved the most about this trip was our tour guide. Adil was relatable to us as we all were in the same age group (we've all attended college). We've played games, shared a ton of stories traveling and even shared our most embarrassing moments. We also had a lot of questions about Morocco which he was always happy to answer. Secondly, the tagine chicken skewers were my favorite meal in any restaurant we stopped at. It's flavorful and fulfilling.Since this is a two-day trip and you're staying in for 1 night, I would recommend packing some basic hygiene (toothbrush, soap, and shampoo) as they do have a bathroom with toilets and showers. Pack in some light cotton pajamas if you're going there during the summer. Additionally, wear light cotton clothing that covers you so that you don't get sunburn on your arms and legs. If a sandstorm ever hits you, make sure you bring something to cover your head and eyes! Also, I would recommend wearing close-toed shoes since the sand is hot as well."

We always felt safe with him. Rashid was an excellent guide who patiently answered all of our questions (we had a lot) and introduced us to Morocco\u2019s culture. He was always open to talking, but also respectful of silence. We particularly enjoyed listening to his collection of Moroccan music. He knew where to go for the best dates, helped us buy cloth for a turban (highly recommended for the camel ride), and always made sure we were comfortable. His sense of humor added a wonderful dynamic to the trip. All in all, highly recommend this tour along with Brahim and Rashid."

Everyone is there to help personalise your tour and make it memorable from the Top Desert crew to the Hotel in the Dades gorge, the places they stop for food especially the Ksar Timney because that is exactly what they did for us. The transport is luxurious and air conditioning amazing even on a 38 degree day. Mubarack is the safest driver. We felt we were in great hands from our pick up till drop off. During this time we had gone from driver and guide to friend. He was always smiling and happy. During the trip we never felt rushed and he gauged our interests such as fossils and geography so took us to places that were of interest to us. Between the four of us we can not say one thing was our favourite as so many things were. Up there in the list is the camel ride to and from the desert, the Kasbah, the fossil visit and seeing the huge diversity in scenery as you travel through MoroccoOverall we wish to thank Mubarack for making our trip full of memories and we hope to be back one day."

Moha, the Top Desert agent, was able to tailor a trip to our needs even though most of the packages are three days or more and we only had two days. Our tour guides, Brahmin and Rashid, picked us up in a brand new and comfortable Toyota Land Cruiser and drove us twelve hours through the Atlas Mountains and the desert ( no roads in the desert, just riding across the sand). They stopped often at interesting spots, and even planned a nomad's picnic lunch. The scenery is beautiful and our conversation was so delightful that getting to know these two men was as much a highlight as the desert. As a young child, Rashid grew up in the desert, and his family has been nomads for generations, so the desert is his pride and home. Brahim is an extraordinary driver negotiating the mountain driving with ease and somehow never getting tired. We felt totally safe with him at the wheel. When we were an hour from camp, we were met by camel's and rode the last hour through the Sahara on camel. It sounds like a touristy thing to do, but really riding through the endless waves of sand dunes on the back of my calm camel in the total silence was a powerful and profound experience. I glanced over and there was Rashid, walking along like a desert prince back in his home. The tent camp is definitely glamming, with a comfortable bed, toilet and shower. We just happened to be the only people in the camp that night, so we had four or five friendly and polite men attentive to our every need and it was almost embarrassing to be that indulged. We sat in front of our tent as the sun went down, chatting with Brahim and Rashid, and it felt as if we were with friends. We were served a huge portion of lamb tagine and couscous for dinner. We arose early to watch the sunrise over the dunes, and after breakfast, we started the twelve hour ride back with lovely stops, and at the end, I was sad to say goodbye to my new friends. I highly recommend this experience to see an essential part of Morocco."

It began with a very easy-to-use website and very clear communication before arriving in Morocco. They contacted our Riad before we arrived in Marrakech to ensure someone would be available when they came to pick us up at 4am. They made special accommodations as we wanted to go to the big dunes and just spend one night in the desert because we were short on time.Our driver Brahim and guide Rachid were excellent. We felt safe driving the long distance over the atlas mountains and through the desert with brahim. He was prompt with timing and an excellent driver. On the ride out to the dunes we stopped in a few towns as we requested for tea and coffee and to see the local culture. We stopped at a few lookout points along the way as well. They were very flexible with stops as we drove. Rachid was very knowledgeable about the landscape, architecture, and Berber culture. Upon arrival at the dunes our accommodations were excellent. We were able to sandboard and explore. Rachid and Omer made an amazing dinner with traditional soup and lamb tagine. Truly excellent food. Brahim and Rachid graced us with some Berber drum music around the fire following dinner.The drive home was also exciting with stops in the village with a female carpet cooperative. Beautiful carpets and reasonable prices. Overall Brahim and Rachid really made our Chegaga experience everything we could have wanted and more. They were knowledgable and enjoyable to be around. Would definitely choose Rachid and Brahim to guide our trip again!Just an FYI that this trip is typically done in 3 days/2 nights but we had limited time in morroco. If you're open to the drive though it can be done by an early am departure on day one. These guys made it work and it didn't seem rushed at all. Michael and Varsha"

Both were extremely attentive and answered all our questions. They made sure we were enjoying ourselves at all times. The tour itself is very comprehensive. To me, it was the best way to get from one city to another, as it gives you the opportunity to see different berber villages, visit old kasbahs, cross the Atlas Mountains, and most importantly visit Erg Chebbi! A definite must!"

The trip was very comfortable in a luxurious vehicle and we stopped at a few different places including a beautiful Riad where we had a lovely lunch. We rode camels into the evening and had a great Moroccan dinner followed by traditional music around the fire place. Such a great experience! We recommend trying the 2 night 3 day experience.Best wishes,Brett and Cleox"

TopDesert organised it very well and provided a large minibus for the 7 of us which was very comfortable for the entire journey. Moubarak, our host, was a great guide and made sure that we made the most of our trip. The sites, food and hotel were all terrific. But the best part of the trip was the desert experience which was absolutely unforgettable. The entire family came away thinking that this was a once in a lifetime journey and were not disappointed. Well done to Moubarak and his colleague who drove us more than 1200km. We had an amazing experience."

            "review": "Sahara desert in the summer. After reading countless of forum posts on tripadvisor and contacting a few other companies, we ultimately decided to book with TopDesert because Moha was always attentive and quick to reply to our e-mails and the package they offered was very competitive in relation to the price. It was a decision we definitely do not regret and would encourage everyone to book with TopDesert because of the hospitality offered by the guides! TopDesert is a small family company and both our driver and guide Moubarak & Mukha were very hospitable and did their best to accommodate to our requests. They were always ready to answer any questions we had & Moubarak was keen to share his vast knowledge of Morocco with us. As Morocco gets really hot in summer (reaching 40 degrees in the afternoon) and we were not able to deal with the heat well, Moubarak was able to plan our schedule such that we had lunch in the late afternoon to avoid the blazing heat! On the first day, Moubarak & Mukha arrived at our Riad exactly on time to pick us up and waited patiently for us to finish our breakfast before heading off. Throughout the trip, Moubarak was very accommodating of our requests and did his very best to make our trip as comfortable as possible. CarWe were picked up in a 4x4 vehicle which was very comfortable and had ample space for both of us. You can choose between airconditioning or natural fresh air and if you wanted a/c, don't hesitate to tell the guides! They are very friendly and the aircon worked well and helped us cool down when the weather was blazing. In addition, the car was clean and neat when we first went in, which meant that they had it cleaned up as they just finished a tour a day before. Accommodation The accommodation provided to us on the first night was perfect for the price we paid. The Aircon was working, which is something important in this 40 degrees weather. In addition, the toilet and shower was clean and working well. We had a comfortable night and had a good rest. To top it off, we were greeted with an amazing view of the waterfall from our room. Dinner and breakfast served were large in portions, and with quality.On the second night, we stayed in the desert and due to the heat, we decided to sleep on the pillows and beds laid out in the open in the desert with the guides and locals as it was too hot in the tent. We enjoyed the starry night & the Berber music the desert staff shared with us. Food served by the desert hosts were decent, with ample portions. The toilets and showers were surprisingly clean, and toilet flushes well, although the pressure in the shower could have been a little stronger . However, keep in mind that we are in the desert and so it is probably a lot harder to provide the same amenities. That said, Moubarak constantly checked on us to make sure that we were comfortable & even woke us up in the morning so we could catch the sunrise!Throughout the long car journey, there were a lot of photo stops made so that the journey did not feel so long. We visited the places included in the itinerary & they absolutely blew us away! Moubarak was always there to ask if we wanted a photo and a huge bonus was his great photography skills!! Thanks to him, we now have a lot of photos to look back fondly upon! All in all, if the weather had been better, we would definitely rate this trip 10/10! Thank you Moubarak for your hospitality & I encourage everyone to book your trip with TopDesert! You will not be disappointed! "

We were very lucky to have had Moubarak as our tourguide, we couldn't have wished anyone else. Throughout the entire trip, he told us the most interesting facts that made us able to understand Morrocan culture as well as the nature and history. We also got the opportunity to see the real, true Morroco. Moubarak was always in the best mood and couldn't get that funny smile from his face. He treated us like friends and made us feel welcome everywhere we went. By listening to his visions and stories, it became clear that our tourguide was someone with a beatiful, warm character. The first day of the tour we crossed the Atlas Mountains through a wonderful route and Moubarak stopped the car on the best places so we could take as many pictures as we wanted. At night we stayed in a nice hotel in the Dadesvalley. We received a warm welcome, the staff there was very friendly. The next morning we crossed another part of the Atlas Mountains and in the evening we arrived to the Sahara. After an epic camel ride through the Sahara, we stayed in a camp in the desert. The food there was absolutely delicious! The best and most pure Morrocan food, better than the food in all the recommended restaurants of Marrakesh, truly. After our meal, we had a perfect evening. Three lovely toearegs danced, sang and played music with us under a magical heaven full of stars. After a while Moubarak joined us too, which made it even more fun. The toearegs were so kind, welcoming and funny that I will remember that evening for the rest of my life! We got the chance to sleep outside under the stars. The last day we drove back to the Atlas Mountains through another route and we arrived back in Marrakesh in the evening. During the whole trip, there wasn't a single moment I was bored or not having fun. The landscapes were unbelievebly enchanting and we had the best company so it would be impossible to not have loved the tour. Thank you Top desert, Moubarak, the staff of the Dadeshotel and the toearegs for giving me three of the best days of my life.One essential tip for those who have planned a tour with Moubarak: if you download 'Helo' by Adele and lots of songs by Years&Years, the car will be turned into a real party and your gide will be the most happy man in Morocco!Lots of kisses, DJ Kato"

            "review": "Into the Heart of the Mergouza Desert. My friend and I did a 1 night/2 day private tour to go to the Mergouza desert. We had read that this desert and sand dunes is more magical than Zagora so we chose to do this tour. We woke up at 3 am to be picked up at 4 am with our driver Abdul. We couldn`t find any tours that had only 1 night as we were only in Morocco for 4 days and Top Desert was kind to arrange what they usually do in 3 days/2 nights to 2 days/1 night. It was a lot of driving but we are used to travelling long distances. We were able to visit Ait Benhaddou at 08h00 and there were only about 4 ppl there which was great. Our driver informed us that about 1000 people visit this location a day so we got to beat the rush! Abdul was very funny and knowledgeable. We are 2 young Canadians in our late 20`s and early 30`s and felt very safe! We ended up being the only 2 going into the desert with this tour company with camels and were a bit worried at first spending the night alone with a bunch of men but no one bothered us. Also there are many other camps that are very near by! Everyone was really kind and they sang us songs. They asked us to do something Canadian and we randomly did the ``Chicken Dance`` and explained many ppl do this at weddings for fun. While on our drive back I woke up to see our driver and my friend doing the ``chicken dance`` in the car. It became our joke. The supper at the berber camps was delicious!! It was a called Tajin. It was the best stew I have ever had and my father went to Morocco 40 years ago and said it was the best stew he has ever had as well! Would highly recommend it! However would recommend doing the 3 day/2 night tour if don`t want to drive 8-10 hours + a day.P.S. If your an animal lover, please bring some treats (all the animals eat soft cheese - even the cats (very soft cheese almost like philadelphia cream cheese type that I saved from the Riad) and I saved lots of uneaten cooked chicken or fish to feed the cats/dogs. I did learn that next time I visit a country with many strays I would bring some small containers and bring water - I don`t know where the animals drink in some of these hot places). So please do that, these animals would very much appreciate it! Thanks!"

            "review": "Epic Sahara Adventure!. We just got back to Marrakech after a 3 night 4 day tour from Marrakech into the Sahara. We had an awesome guide named Moubarak who took great care of us in all aspects of the trip. The best part of this company was the interaction with local people in the Sahara and on the way there and back. We visited small villages and were given multiple opportunities to interact with locals and really feel the culture and spirit (which is entirely different to Marrakech!) Our guide helped us to learn basic language and inform us on all aspects of life in Morocco. The accommodation and restaurants we visited all had a local feeling and you didn't feel like a tourist and were always treated well by the staff. The Sahara is amazing. We spent a day in the local Oasis after riding there by camel, then returned to camp by camel at sunset. The sunsets and sunrise are great and the night sky is filled with stars. The staff in the camp were great, Hamid cooked great meals and cleaned up all the unwanted sand while we were out and our camel guide Mustapha also cooked an epic Tagine for us in the oasis. Overall we absolutely loved the trip and want to thank all the staff for there consistent hard work and attitude while also managing Ramadan, we really appreciate everything you did for us. The way they care for the local community and their attitude and commitment to making sure everyone is cared for is amazing and we will be taking that away with us. All the best to the top desert team and Moubarak, always take the weather with you!"

            "review": "Wonderful desert - poor driving!. Having picked this tour group from the many\u00a0 positive reviews on trip advisor, we had high expectations going on our 3 day, 2 nights tour to the desert from marrakech. The majority of this tour has met (or we would go so far as to say exceeded) our expectations although we did experience some issues. Our driver (Mubarak) picked us up an hour late, which wasn't a great start. However, shortly after pick up, we were driven to numerous beautiful sights on our way to the desert.The first thing we noticed in the 40 degree + heat in June, was that although our car had the option of air con, it wasn't used until we had to put it on ourselves (around 5 hours into our 7 hour drive as we couldn't take the heat any longer). Other than a very small part of our three day journey, the driver preferred to have the windows down (blowing oven hot air into the car) and so we were rather hot and uncomfortable throughout.\u00a0 My hair was also a windblown mess, sitting in the back seat.We were able to take some great pictures.\u00a0 The driver pointed out different sights to us but no explanations were given as to the history of what we were seeing.\u00a0 There were also a few times that we did feel a little scared with the driving - we were overtaking every car we came across round bends on the mountains, tailgating cars and the driver talked on his mobile whilst doing the driving - but thankfully there were no incidents other than oncoming vehicles flashing their lights at us for being so close to hitting each other. The driver also had his moroccan music on so loud that it gave us both a headache, although to his credit, he did turn it down when asked.\u00a0 We did raise the driving as an issue but we were told that if he hadn't been driving the way he had, then we wouldn't get anywhere. I was also mocked by the driver for being scared (he made reference to me as a woman which I found to be both sexist and very offensive) and was told that I should \"place my trust in god\" and basically deal with it, which was neither appreciated nor a useful response or indeed professional. There were several rest breaks put in for our incredibly long journey. At one point the driver drove off without notifying us,\u00a0 we believed he left to carry out personal shopping/errands. Our suitcase, belongings including our wallets were in the car with him and we had no idea whther he was going to come back to get us. He would also stop at markets to carry out personal shopping.\u00a0 Despite the above, we were thankful for the effort put in by the team especially during Ramadan, which we appreciate is a tough month. Once we arrived at the desert, we couldn't\u00a0 believe how beautiful it was. We stayed in absolute luxury in the Sahara desert. We were\u00a0 not expecting such comfort in the middle of no where, we had fully plumbed washing facilities, personal sun loungers, a private fire side traditional music experience and all of this was under the beautiful starry sky (it's worth waiting up to see the Milky way in all its glory).We were even able to celebrate our 30th birthday with a cake provided complimentary by the team!The team in the desert were amazing! They couldn't do enough to help and make our trip as enjoyable as possible and we absolutely loved it!We have never been more glad to get back to marrakech in one piece.\u00a0 We would rate the desert experience as 5 stars as we could not fault anything once we arrived. However, the driving did let us down a lot and so overall, we would rate this experience as 3 stars. "

My fianc\u00e9 booked our day excursion to Essaouira through Top Dessert, leaving from Marrakech.We had Moubarak as our driver for the two of us in his very spacious and comfortable car. We couldn't have asked for a better person to take us. He is a very kind, caring and generous man, who treated us more like old friends rather than paying customers. He made us feel very comfortable and welcome, and the trip was a pleasure to share with him. He was very happy to answer any questions we had and we also felt he taught us a lot about Moroccan culture and history.Our day started with Moubarak meeting us at our Riad in the Medina of Marrakech at 8am. He welcomed us and explained our itinerary for the day.The overall journey to Essaouira took about 3 - 3.5 hours with various stops along the way. The first stop being for coffee and breakfast in a nice cafe in a small village.From there our second stop was a short stop in the countryside to see the goats that climb the argan trees, which we both enjoyed very much and was a sight we had never seen before. The experience was only made better by getting to hold the most adorable baby goat.After that Moubarak took us to a woman's co-oprative where they make the argan oil. A very friendly lady took us to see the women at work where she talked us through the process and the different uses of the nut. She then took us to the shop where we sampled the different cosmetic and edible oils and butters, where these can be bought if you wish.It was then back in the car where we enjoyed more conversation and good Moroccan music with Moubarak. It was then a short drive to our last stop before Essaouira which was a view point looking over Essaouira and the coast. Here we took photos and you could ride camels if you wanted.Then the final leg of the trip took us to the Medina wall of Essaouira where Moubarak gave us a short walk around the Medina explaining the area then he walked us down to the port where he suggested we had lunch, which we did. He then left us to it to have a look around the town for about 4 hours, which was plenty of time. We had a lovely lunch on the port where we got to chose our fish, which had all been caught that morning. We then casually walked around the Medina and did some shopping. For any music lover you must visit Bob's music, which was a hidden gem.After our time in Essaouira we met Moubarrk back at the car to make our journey back to Marrakech.All in all we would highly recommend this trip and if you have Moubarak as your driver you are in safe hands and will have a lot of fun along the way! Also to add my fianc\u00e9 said Moha was fantastically helpful when it came to organising the trip. We wanted a trip to Essaoaira as my fianc\u00e9's mother had been and Moha helpfully recommended that a day trip would be the perfect amount of time to take it all in which it was. He was very responsive and helpful. Highly recommend without a doubt!! Sean and Noemie"

We would like to say a BIG thank you (SHOUKRA) to Top Desert Tours and especially to our tour guide Khalid for offering us the amazing opportunity to see the beauty of Morocco and be able to travel to the Sahara Desert!We took a 3-day trip from Marrakech to the desert and we can't describe in words all the beautiful places we have seen on the way! All the trip was superbly organised and personalised according to what we wanted to see and where we wanted to stop to take pictures! Khalid has been a wonderful trip companion with a vast knowledge about places and different Moroccan traditions and lifestyles and above all very patient and understanding with us! Every place had something unique and we have wonderful memories.The desert was absolutely magnificent and the camp where we stayed was amazing! Thank you to all for the effort put into making the camp look so welcoming and authentic. We have taken many pictures with all the small details, our camel ride and enjoyed all the food cooked to perfection and the traditional Berber music by the fire in the evening under the stars! Thank you again to everyone for their hospitality and to Khalid for driving safely, being very friendly and taking us to all the nice places so that we could take all the pictures we wanted!We would highly recommend Top Desert Tours and please don't hesitate to book a trip with them if you are planning to go to Morocco!"

            "review": "Adventure of a lifetime; A very generous and kind \"business\". Moubarak, our guide, is and will likely remain one of the most kind, generous, thoughtful and optimistic individuals I have had the good fortune of coming into contact with. Five friends accompanied me as we traveled to Marrakech, all of us experiencing our first trip to the African continent in our young lives. Immediately we were blown away by the culture shock that makes up that hectic city, but not soon after inspired by the open and vibrant nature of the people there. We had been in contact with \"Moha\" and embarked on our (3 day) \"Marrakech desert trip to Erg Chegaga dunes\" the morning after our initial arrival (I would recommend doing what we did and dedicating 2 days to see Marrakesh itself; we returned for another night after the tour). Moubarak picked us up at our hostel's doors and immediately began conversing and getting to know all of us. He frequently told us stories, and never ceased to spread his contagious optimism about life as we traversed many many miles throughout the Moroccan countryside. He knows his country. That can be concluded without a doubt. He and other members of Top Desert have not placed \"profit\" or \"business\" as their greatest priorities. No, instead Moubarak's philosophy towards life is one where he can share stories, spread cheer, and as clich\u00e9 as this all sounds: see to it that the world consistently progresses towards being a better place. Throughout your stay he will take you to see snow in the Atlas mountains, the Saharan desert, and countless Berber villages. Knowing the country and being an excellent driver allowed him to allow us to see a large portion of the southern third of the country. Too, he never left us uninformed about cultural or historical significance behind the places we visited. The night in the desert is truly harmonious; no modern buildings to block your sights or smog to prevent the night sky from being draped in bright stars. My only complaint about my trip with Top Desert stems from my own foolishness - only allowing myself a week to traverse this remarkable country, and only allotting enough funds to spend three days with top desert. I hope to return to Morocco one day, hopefully alongside family or close friends, and when I do I will most certainly be looking into contacting Top Desert. There is something for everyone in Morocco - brilliant landscapes, cultural hubs, forests, mountains, and ocean. The Moroccans know their country best, so it never hurts to allow a new friend such as Moubarak guide you in a manner that allows you to see so much of it in such little time."

As we were only in Morocco for a short time we could only do the two day/one night desert trip to Erd Lihoudi.This means many hours driving each way but the scenery is beautiful and our guide / driver, Abba was interesting, helpful and a very competent driver. Added to this, his car was air conditioned and comfortable. The road through the Atlas mountains does twist and turn though so those suffering from travel sickness may wish to take tablets.Camel riding through the desert edge and small dunes was good fun and we arrived at camp in time to climb a massive dune and watch the sun set over the Sahara desert - a memory to keep forever!The camp itself was comfortable, with beautiful tents complete with proper beds, plentiful blankets and electricity. There was even a shower block and toilets which were kept very clean.The food, served in a lovely communal tent, was very tasty, as was the tea! The traditional music after dinner was another happy memory as well.On the journey home Abba was his usual happy, helpful self, stopping at many places for stunning photograph opportunities, the film studios, Kasbah and lunch."

Initially, we had a problem with a change in flight time and before we even arrived to Morocco they were helpful and accommodating. Once we were there, it was nothing short of spectacular. Our sherpa was Abdul who is knowledgeable, funny and stopped at nothing to ensure we had an amazing trip. We did the two day one night trip to Erg Lihoudi Dunes. We were able to ride camels, go sand boarding and camp for the night. The food provided was delicious- they even accommodated for some dietary restrictions. The tents were comfortable and the sherpas even moved around beds so that my friends and I could stay together. Each of the two days we had a 9 hour car ride which was pretty long but the views along the way were beautiful and Abdul stopped whenever we were hungry or needed to use the restroom and also provided an aux cord. In addition, Abdul had his brother pick us up from our hotel and drive us to the airport even after our tour was over. I would recommend this company to absolutely anyone, especially Abdul."

We opted for the 3 day, 2 night excursion from Marrakech to Fes with a night in the desert at Erg Chebbi. From the beginning, everything was seamless. Rabii \u2013 an incredibly nice, wise, and philosophical guy that we had endless fun with! \u2013 met us at the airport and we departed from there. The tour was very comfortable; the first day was packed with beautiful sights and caf\u00e9s or spots to rest. We stayed that night in the most idyllic riad in a fairly secluded valley. Waking up in that valley was otherworldly. We then departed to the desert. We took camels to a beautiful tent camp from which you could see the border with Algeria. (Sandboarding, drumming, dancing, and stargazing all part of the fun.) The last day dropped us in Fes, stopping in various small cities along the way.We planned to stay in Fes one day, and graciously, Rabii offered to stay a day and take us back to Marrakech the next (not usually covered in the tour). We worked it out so that we paid Rabii the same amount we would pay the Moroccan coach. This was perfect for all of us, and it was bittersweet to say goodbye to Rabii at the end.This was the highlight of our week. I wouldn't have done it any other way. Through talking with Rabii and the locals, I feel like I got an accurate and insightful look into what Morocco means to them, which is what I find most meaningful.To clarify, we were four students, and this was a very good use of time and money on a student budget."

I was looking for a trip organizer who is locally-based and able to give me an authentic Moroccan experience and I am glad that my choice of Top Desert Tours proved to be the best I could think of!. As they say in their website, they are truely Berber local Moroccans who definitely know how to project their beautiful country and culture to visitors!. Right from my first contact with Moha, I was extremely well guided and all questions patiently answered. Adil and Ibrahim, the 2 Berber guides/Chauffeur made made my trip extremely special with their kindness and super friendly approach. we also had wonderful discussions all along the way. The Landcruiser provided was very comfortable. The highlight of the tour was certainly the Sahara Desert, which was a dream-come-true for me. I couldn't imagine such a great desert camp right in-between the dunes. The Camp is like a miracle (tastefully done accommodation, flowing hot water etc..). Overall, Top desert must your choice, if you are looking for interaction with locals, understand Berber culture and feel one among them. After all, this trip means much more than just clicking photos at beautiful spots on the way. Well done Top Desert Tours and high respects from me!"

Firstly, Mubarak is a saint, it has been amazing watching someone be so kind to so many different people. He is a wonderful man. And with a wonderful man you get wonderful driving, a wonderful journey, a wonderful adventure and the wonderful list goes on!There is a lot of driving involved but the hours fly by as you drink in the beautiful scenery of Morroco. With plenty of oppurtunities to take pictures and stretch your legs.Once at the dunes you must savour every moment as you don't get long there. We chose to quad bike for an hour, I 100% recommend this!! Then we rode a camel. The dunes are absolutely amazing and the sunset was so peaceful and beautiful. I would totally redo the trip just for to do it all again. Also, the boy who was working at the camp at the dunes was timid but very likeable and made our time at the dunes relaxing and comfortable. I would recommend this trip to anyone. Accommodation and food through out was good. I have a few tips if you are to go:1. Bring sweeties for the nomad and Berber children2. Don't go to the gallery, this was the only negative about our trip. They say you are obliged not to buy anything but don't take no for an answer and are quite brash and forceful in getting a yes3. If you have sensitive skin bring a full set of pjs for the tent. I have sensitive skin and have come up in a rash from the sheets while my bf is fine. I can't hold this against them as my skin is ultra sensitive! "

Top Desert provides smooth, magic carpet trips through the mountains, past Kasbahs and gorges to the dunes of the south. And back, sadly. A magic carpet Land Cruiser picks you up and whisks you away from bustling airport or chaotic Marrakech, stopping where you wish en route. Your driver, in our case Excellent Abdul, provides commentary and explanation where and when you need it. And the number of beautiful things to see is phenomenal. It's worth being aware that there's a lot of driving involved (although you can also spend days, lazy or active, as you wish, in the desert). Certainly in early spring the nights are really cold. I am pretty sure we'll be going back and I am sure that Top Desert would tailor-make for our next itinerary."

I will start by saying that that was our single favorite experience in Morocco.We chose to do a 3 days tour to Erg Chergaga and everything went as smoothly as possible. Moha was really helpful with the booking and he always answered every e-mail or WhatsApp message right away.We got picked up at our Riad in Marrakesh right on time and we made the trip in a very confortable, very big and new Land Rover. On the way to the desert we stopped at a lot of beautiful sites, including the place where they shoot a lot of famous movies like The Gladiator and Game of Thrones!The road to the desert is really really beautiful.. we drove by all those really brown moutains with all these really green and lush oasis on its feet. It was one of the most beautiful landscapes we ever saw!Then we got to the Sahara Desert. SO. AMAZING.I wanted to cry when we got there, I wanted to cry when we watched the sunset overlooking miles and miles of sand dunes. I wanted to cry when the night came and we were greeted with THE MOST AMAZING starry sky of our lives! There were zillions of stars EVERYWHERE we looked. The sky was SO BIG, you had a perfect 360\u00ba view of the horizon. I never felt so connected with nature, SO BLESSED by its beauty.And then I have to talk about our guide and driver, Abdoul. I'll start by saying that you are actually NOT our guide and driver, you are family.We couldn't have asked for a better person to spend these 3 days with. He know so much about Morocco, he is so smart, so funny, so friendly! He played soccer with my dad and my sister, he played and sang berber songs for us, he told us stories and played charades with us. He gave my dad his turban as a sign of friendship and he now has a Brazil shirt to remember us! We named the desert dog together (Astolfo, remember? hahaha). And on the way back, when me and my father were feeling sick, he even took care of us and gave us medicine. You were amazing, Abdoul! Thank you so much for everything! And remember that when you come to Brazil, you have a home here! And also you have to come because we need to play soccer again, the re-match! hahahaWe would also like to thank everyone else that spent the night at the desert with us.. Ali, you were so great helping go up at the dunes and bringing us water when we felt like passing out hahaha and thank you for sharing the sunset with us! We have photos together that I will e-mail to Moha later, so you can see :)Anyway.. if I could give one advise for those planning a trip to Morocco, that would be it: GO TO THE SAHARA. Watch the sunset over the dunes. Stay up at night admiring the most amazing sky. And do that with TOP DESERT and Abdoul. I assure you, you will never forget this experience.(The person from Top Desert who reads this, could you please show it to Abdoul and Ali? It would really mean a lot to us!)"

Also, having a completely private tour was the perfect way to go.We had some ideas about what we wanted to do before we left (from Orlando, Florida) and Top Desert created a custom experience for us, tailoring it to each of our needs, without hesitation and always with perfect recommendations. There's no way you'll know everything that you want to do before you get here, and their flexibility and ability to plan activities and reservations on the spot was mind-blowing. We were picked-up at the airport by our main guide, Abdul, who was outstanding, and considered a good friend to all of us now. He went far out of his way for us on numerous occasions and was just incredible. He was also a safe and great driver, something I can absolutely appreciate now, afterwards.Before going on our desert tour, we also expressed interest in hiking the Atlas mountains (Toubkal). They set us up with incredible and hospitable guides that took care of everything. We also ate lunch and slept in a Berber village--an incredible experience. In addition to answering about a thousand of our questions about Marrakesh and Morocco in general, we drove to Erg Chebbi (in a nice Land Cruiser) and spent the night in the desert, rode camels, 4x4s, sand-boarding, etc. They made it all happen without issue and always asking for our feedback. There were also several places, food, shopping and experiences before, during and after the desert and hiking trips that they helped us out with and just made the entire trip amazing. I've been on a few other tours before, but Abdul and Top Desert really went above and beyond, tailoring our entire trip for us and made it the trip of a lifetime."

            "review": "A fantastic trip, and a truly fantastic guide.. I was on a 6-week trip around Europe this winter with family, and we decided to head to Morocco for ten days to escape the cold. An old work colleague recommended Top Desert, having just traveled with them. I emailed Moha, who handles the bookings, and his communication was excellent. We requested Moubarak, as my friend had spoken really highly of him. Top Desert was really flexible, allowing us to put together a slightly different itinerary. We had the entire trip booked a week in advance - very short notice, but Top Desert delivered. We spent 10 days in Morocco and 7 of them with Moubarak. Our itinerary took us from Marrakech to Erg Chebbi in the Sahara, traveling via the Dades Gorge. After Erg Chebbi we went up to Fes, stayed a night, and then went on to Chefchaouen for one night (to see the famous blue Medina) before returning to Fes and flying out. Essentially we took the 5-day desert tour from Marrakech to Fes, and added a two return trip to Chefchaouen. I highly recommend it. It's worth noting that Moubarak didn't have the necessary paperwork to be our guide for Fes or Chefchaouen, as it wasn't really part of their set tour. We were told of that in advance, and it was not an issue as both of those places we were eager to explore solo. In terms of handling the bookings, Moha did a fantastic job, and there was constant communication between he and Moubarak throughout the trip to make sure things we running smoothly. While on our trip we met another Top Desert guide, Abdou, who was with another group. We found a deck of cards and played a few games of cards with him. He's an absolute legend.But now some things about Moubarak. He's a very safe and experienced driver. At the very beginning of our journey, heading into the Atlas mountains we got stuck behind a convoy carrying all the King's horses (literally). We crept along behind the convoy for a good 40 minutes until Moubarak found a moment where it was safe to overtake. He has the patience of a saint. He is from the south, specifically Merzouga, so he knows the people and region he's showing you. He knows where the best view is. Where the cleanest, tastiest food is. He also knows an incredible amount about Morocco's history and geography - as we found out later in our journey, Moubarak has also studied many of the major philosophers. Come armed with questions, because Moubarak is a knowledgable man. He likes music - bring a good playlist and an aux cord, and make sure \"Stand By Me\" and \"Hotel California\" are on there. Oh, and \"Know Yourself\" by Drake. He'll help you put together your Moroccan playlist.He likes to stop and buy fruit from the farmers along the road. And it's really, really good.He knows a backroad in the cedar forest of Azrou that will bring you up close and personal with some incredible wildlife. He does an incredible amount behind the scenes. I got a sinus infection in the desert and my nose swelled up instantly. By the time we got back from our camel trek Moubarak had made a return trip to the pharmacy in Merzouga and brought back medicine. I didn't ask, he just went. I had some antibiotics and was fine within a day. Choose Top Desert. You'll be glad you did when you're sitting comfortable in your Toyota Landcruiser, watching the giant tour buses navigating the narrow passes. You'll be glad you did when you see that of all the desert camps, you're staying in the best one. But mostly you'll be glad you did because you'll have the time of your life, and you'll make at least one new friend.Thank you Moubarak, thank you Moha!"

Our driver and guide, Abdoul, met us at our Riad in Marrakech at 7am on the dot, and the rest is history. Not only was the Land Cruiser itself quite comfortable (and we were in it for a long time), but Abdoul made sure we were good every km of the way, from letting us listen to our Western music (we switched it up and grooved to some Moroccan tunes too), to stopping for our countless photo opportunities, to making sure we were getting the best deals on all of the souvenirs and goods we wanted to buy.I have not laughed as much as I have on this trip in awhile. Abdoul went above and beyond, and always put our safety and well-being first, but he couldn't prevent the stomach pain and tears from our countless belly laughs ;) and he is a great percussionist to boot!Our camel trek was about 2 hours long, and another guide, Aziz, led our group through the desert, had us stop for an epic sunset (which turned into a photoshoot), and took us to the Berber camp. The camels were very docile and i even had a selfie session with my camel, Bob Marley, but man, make sure you stretch before and after! Those Camel Massages are no joke!The food, the accommodations, and the destinations were all top-notch, and we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves every minute of the tour. When Abdoul dropped us off at our Riad in Fes, it was one of the hardest goodbyes we've ever had to do!Moha and Abdoul, I commend you for creating this family-oriented tour company, and for giving the best customer service I've ever received. I know the two other girls in our group feel the same, but they want to write their own reviews just so we can all give 5 stars :)Thank you for giving us the tour of a lifetime!kathy"

The accommodations were wonderful and the people at the camp were kind and most helpful. We watched the sunset over the dunes and got up early the next morning to watch it rise. It was amazing. We would all recommend Top Desert."

The most wonderful sky i have ever seen! That pure silence... A lifetime experience. Everyone should have this experience at least once in a lifetime.This was possible thanks to Top Desert Tours and all its amazing staff. Fisrt of all Moha, thank you for being so nice helping us to find the best option regarding our budget and available time; and then our guide Moubarak and driver Ibrahim, for being so kind and tireless, for attending our requests, for providing us a safe trip, for directly contacting our rihads on pick up and drop off, for everything. We strongly recommend them.All the comments in tripadvisor were important for us to make a decision at the time. So, i just want to reinforce their professionalism and reliability.It is tiring the 10 hour roadtrip from Marrakech to Erg Lihoudi, but ir totally worth it. You will not regret a minute of it."

            "review": "Safe, fun and amazing!. A bit of background on me and help for those who may be apprehensive. I'm a city girl who doesn't like dirt, nature, camping or really anything related to outdoors. But I am open-minded and willing to try things because I've only got this one life. I'm glad I visited Morocco and experienced this tour. I felt safe and welcomed. Not showering for a couple days was a choice I made, and I'd do it again for an experience like this. Like pretty much everyone who is heading to a new country for the first time, I had a lot of questions and worries. Moha is the one who answers emails, and he is very prompt and amenable to tailoring the tour to our needs. We did the 4 day/3 night tour. We were picked up at our Riad in Marrakesh (Hotel Arabe). We spent two nights in the desert and one night in a Riad on the way back. He even dropped us at the airport!Our driver was great. He drove fast to get us to the desert in time for the sunset on day 1. The off-roading was bumpy but it was clear he was in his element. He knew what he was doing, and we were in a safe car.The desert campsite is beautiful. We were there 2 nights and decided not to shower so can't comment on those. The toilets are ok. They don't flush, and you pour water down when done. Dinners were always great. Breakfast was adequate. I would recommend bringing your own soap. The soap for washing your hands wasn't that great, and I'm wondering if that is what got us sick by the end of the trip.One of the days we did a camel tour to a nomad's home for lunch. It was 2.5 hours on the camel each way. We ended up with bruised bums and incredibly sore muscles. I'll never ride a camel again, but this one experience was worth the pain. The nomad and his family only spoke Arabic. The teenage daughter spoke some French, so I was able to communicate with her a bit but overall we just simply chilled at their temporary home for a few hours for tea, biscuits and lunch. A goat ultimately ate all my biscuits, but that's ok. It was the most authentic experience we had and awesome!I would not recommend riding a camel for longer than 30-45 minutes at a time... unless you want seriously painful thigh gap. Therefore, ask for the shorter camel ride to watch the sunrise in the morning or to a nearby desert restaurant for lunch. My camel did take a nose dive and popped right back up. I wasn't thrown thanks to holding on for dear life, but that was pretty scary!The sunrises, sunsets and stars at night are the best part of the trip. We stayed in the luxury tents and they were great. Lighting isn't the best, so make sure to use your iphone flashlight or bring one. Keep your phones on airport mode so you can use necessary features like alarms and flashlights without losing too much battery. On the way back, we stayed at Ellouze Riad relatively close to Ourzazate. It was a decent riad with adequate showers, a beautiful garden and view, and a decent pool. The owner is French and the food was great. The next day on the drive to the airport, we stopped for lunch at a restaurant recommended by our guide in Marrakesh before heading to the airport. It was some of the best couscous I've ever eaten. Then he dropped us off at the airport with plenty of time before our flight.We gave our guide a big tip at the end because the whole trip really was above and beyond. I'll post some pics when I get a chance, but I assure you a picture could never capture our amazing experience. So what are you waiting for? BOOK NOW!"

I was a bit apprehensive before the trip since I'm paying such a large downpayment to a company I don't know in a foreign country, but I'm glad that the tour exceeded my expectations. Moha, the owner, was responsive and answered my \"numerous\" \"numerous\" questions and gave me all the information I needed to customize the trip. Moha, our driver and guide, exceeded our expectations. Without him, the trip experience would not have been the same. Not only did he look like a well seasoned tour guide, he had alot of experience, had a great personality and took care of us very well. I had asked the owner for a guide who could speak english well and our guide exceeded my expectations.The camel ride was a bit different than I expected. While still in America planning the trip, the owner told me that the camel ride would be 1.5 - 2 hrs but our camel ride was only about 25 minutes total... I was fine with the short camel ride, but if I had known that the camel ride was only 25 minutes, I wouldn't have bought desert gear when I was still in America.My opted for the luxury tents and it also exceeded our expectations. The onsite staff were awesome. The tents were great and I had no complaints about the tent, bathroom, showers, and mattress. The food at dinner was great but the breakfast wasn't very good. We were told by the staff that we should wake up early to see the sunset and that they would take us at a specific time in the morning, but when morning came, no one took us to see the sunset; we had to go on our own.The only real minus of the trip was that we never got to do sandboarding even when I had specifically mentioned it to our guide. This was partly because we wasted alot of time at 2 \"sales\" visits - ie, visits to 2 establishments that were packaged as cultural visits but they really wanted us to buy stuff. The most annoying sales visit was to a carpet store that took more than an hour. We did get a nice demo of their many many carpets, but even though the host insisted that buying was not necessary, his staff didn't take no for an answer and were doing hard sells and used many other pressure tactics. They wouldn't leave me alone even though I had no intention of buying any rugs. For the record, their rugs were very expensive and I didn't buy any.Despite some of the minuses that I mentioned, which were not egregious, I would absolutely recommend Top Desert. They are reputable and provide high quality tours."

We did not get a tour guide as we thought we would but our driver was pretty good at giving us some history and facts about the areas we went through. We did not feel rushed through anything and was given as much time as we needed at each stop. the ride through the Atlas mountains was amazing and the hotel was fantastic. Everyone staff member was polite and very easy going. The trip to the dessert was amazing! We did not get a offer for sand boarding but we were not interested. The dunes and the view of the Algerian boarder were phenomenal! I have been camping lots but nothing like sleeping under the stars in the Sahara. The food at every place was at least good most were excellent. We were introduced to many locals who of course always had a pitch but we never felt pressure to but a thing. We actually were welcomed into the home of some carpet makers got to see first hand how they did there work. Now of course we were offered to by a rug or 2 after tea and conversation but when we could not buy one there were no hard feelings. The experience in that mans home actually motivated us to find the money to bring a large carpet home. So I guess his pitch worked :). Over all this was a great experience but be ready for a lot of time in the truck! it is a long drive but so much to see."

We opted for Top desert, because they quickly responded to questions and delivered customer service to which you feel comfortable to fully prepay the trips.On a Monday we went to Ouzoud. Our driver, Khalid, is very nice, careful driver and knowledgeable about his country. He actually recommended us to change our 3-day desert tour from erg chagaga to erg chebbi. The reason is that erg chebbi has beautiful red colored dunes, so we were sold. The day tour to Ouzoud was a great experience. We did not opt for a tourguide, and stupid us, we got lost. So you might want to be less 'adventures' and opt for the guide.Khalid was also our driver for the 3-day desert tour starting on Wednesday and you can hear he is passionate about his country. We had ample opportunity to take pictures or take potty breaks. You will visit the high atlas mountains, its kasbahs, the Telouet kasbah and the world heritage protected ait benhaddou kasbah. The hotel on the first night was in Ourzazate and it was beautiful and comfortable. The second night was in a camp, and it was an experience we will never forget. It is wonderful to be in the desert, but we are a little bit high maintenance, so the very simple toilet and shower threw us off a bit. However, that did not stop us from enjoying this experience. The third day you drive back to Marrakech, which is a very long ride, but possible to do. Just sit back and enjoy the view, because it is just gorgeous.Thank you Moha, for your quick and professional services during the reservations and a special thanks to Khalid, who is so kind and customer focused, you cannot not feel comfortable sitting next to him for three days. Thank you Top Desert, for delivering us a once in a lifetime experience."

But we found the TopDesert tours through the excellent evaluations in TripAdvisor and we are really happy with our choice!During the planing of the trip Moha was really helpfull and really nice, answering really fast to every questions that we had.They even were kind enough to call our Riad the day before our trip to plan our pickup with the riad owner.We loved our guide Moubarak and our driver Ibrahim! :) We strongly recommend them! Moubarak was available to answer to all our questions, even the odd ones, and he has a great sense of humor.Arriving to the desert was amazing.. Since the camel ride at the sunset, our conversations under the sky full of stars, the dinner (the best tagine that I ate at Morrocco), the songs and the games after the dinner, the sunrise at the dunes.. We loved it! :) And the sky... That sky! The most starry sky that I've ever seen.. And the silence.. Wonderful! Once again, before our return to Marrakech, Moubarak called the riad owner to plan our pickup at the Djema el Fna. He was really kind.We strongly recommend TopDesert tours and the guide Moubarak! It was a lifetime experience that we will never forget. :)"

The car was nice and clean and the driver (Habib) and guide (Muhammad) were excellent. We did the 2 night/3 day Erg Chebbi Sahara tour and were advised that if there was ANYTHING we wanted to do on the way or anything we wanted to know, that we were to ask as it was \"our trip\". We stopped off every hour or two, sometimes just to take pics and sometimes for a little break from driving. The places we stopped off were beautiful and the guide had so much to tell us. Any question we asked he had a wealth of knowledge about and usually a funny story to go with it. The place we stayed on the first night was unbelievable. We spotted a waterfall close by which we went to and had a dip in the water. Great place for photographs too. We then had dinner and relaxed on the terrace with an amazing view. The food was delicious and we were treated like kings by the lovely staff. We all agreed that if the trip was to end before we even got to the desert that we would have been happy with paying the amount we did. So when we actually did arrive at the drop off spot for the desert we were super excited, and it didn't disappoint!When we arrived in the desert after our camel ride and picture taking we had dinner, and then after that we relaxed with our guides and a few locals. They played some music for us and then they went to bed, leaving us to explore a bit. We lay on one of the dunes looking up at the clear star filled sky while having a few beers that we picked up on the way, until the early hours. It was the most peaceful experience I've had and probably the best night of my life! The trip continued for another day and we were happy enough to be finishing it off as there was so much driving. I would recommend anyone considering this tour to go with this company and if possible ask for the same guide that we had (Muhammad) as we were in no way disappointed."

They always stopped whenever I wanted to take a picture, and if I needed anything out of the ordinary, they always helped track it down for me. I was there for 15 days and visited about 85% of the country. The highlights were, of course, the Erg Chebbi dunes where I went camel trekking and dune buggying. They were both great, but the dune buggying was incredible!! I also went hot-air ballooning near Marrakech for the very 1st time (and I've been to 64 countries). I also checked prices and compared them to other companies out there, and their prices were very competitive with the companies I checked, but they really excelled in helping me plan my trip and Moha was able to get back to me via email ASAP to make any necessary changes we had to make. The riads were clean and comfortable and centrally located to the tourist areas. I highly recommend Top Desert...and if you ever had any doubts about travelling to Morocco...I felt very safe (and walked around, many times after midnight), the people were friendly and easy-going.

We booked 4 days and three nights. This reduces the time spent in the car a bit, which was great for our two teenage sons. The first day we went over the (still partially snow covered) Atlas Mountains and saw picturesque Berber Villages and the amazing Kasbah in Telouet. After a night in Quarzazat we went through the sheer endless Oasis of the Draa Valley into the dessert and stayed overnight in tents in the Erg Chegaga Sand Dunes. That afternoon and night in the dunes was one of the most magical travel experiences of my life. In a landscape straight out of the \"English Patient\", Abdul organised a sunset Camel ride and arranged dinner for the family in a secluded spot in the dunes, lit by millions of stars. We slept in spartan, but comfortable Touareg tents.The next day we drove back to Bab Rimal and after a relaxing for one last night in the Oasis drove back to Marrakech.The best part is: Before this trip my boys liked going on holidays, after our time with Abdul, they can't wait until we go travelling to far places."

Stopping at A\u00eft Ben Haddou on the way back was very interesting and the drive through the back roads into the Atlas mountains from there was stunning.If you've only got 2 days free then this is a good option but you will spend a lot of time driving. February was a good time to visit as the weather was a pleasant improvement from Europe bu t the streets weren't overcrowded with tourists."

Impressive sightseeing and experience with the best guide. We got to stop wherever and whenever we wanted and Hamed was also patient enough to answer all our questions and doubts. Overall a magnificent experience! Highly recommended."

These folks (Moah is the admin contact) are caring and trustworthy. If you're taking the multi day luxury desert tour, it's an experience of a live time tenting and sleeping in the desert. After a lengthy ride there, the camp's service and food was exceptional. Highly recommend Top Desert Tours!"

Moha was very receptive to all of my many questions and managed to organise it so we were picked up from the airport. After this we were taken to the Top Desert office where they provided us with lunch, as we had not eaten since our London flight - very kind. Our guides were lovely, chatty and friendly but also allowed us to do our own thing. The drive was amazing, there is a lot of time in the car but the scenery is magnificent you wouldn't realise! Lots of stops for photographs and meeting with the locals. Our night in the desert was unforgettable! I highly recommend top desert they are very trustworthy and knowledgable about the area and history. Thank you Top Desert!"

My trip with two of my girlfriends to Morocco was great, and a big part of it we owe it to Top Desert.First of all, Moha was really helpful in organizing the trip of 2 nights 3 days to Erg Chigaga, pretty much the day before, answering to all our questions and customizing it to what we wanted to do.After, we experience this beautiful journey with Abdul, who was a great guide, driver and companion who made us feel comfortable and engaged with all the experience.The scenery was beautiful all the way and the places where we spend the night were great. The accommodations were simple, clean, and the people working there were really nice and friendly.

            "review": "Excellent desert and other tour operator. We took the two-night desert tour, and also a day trip to Essaouira. Most of the review relates to the desert tour, as essentially the Essaouira trip was primarily a transport service.The most importAnt aspect of the trip was the guide, and Salah was fantastic - really cautious driver, very easy-going, friendly, knowedgeable about Morocco, its people, the desert and just about everything else. The cherry on the icing on the cake was when my other half forgot her sunglasses in the car after our last trip, and he came to give them to us the next day at no extra cost.The vehicle was also excellent - clearly a purpose-built all-terrain 4x4 (Toyota Land Cruiser), reliable in the desert terrain but also very comfortable.If I had to make a negative comment I'd say some of the venues chosen for stopovers on the way to the desert could have been better - the food was generally pretty poor - but then I guess there were probably limited options in those towns and villages. Not enough to knock off a star!The locations in the desert (the lunch stop and the camp) were very nice - the desert camp with decent sanitary facilities (although do use bottled water to brush your teeth!) and the lunch stop a very nice little oasis. And the food prepared by the cooks in those places was some of the best we had: succulent chicken skewers for lunch, and an excellent tagine for supper (despite it having been prepared in a sandstorm!)And finally - the main event, camel trekking and sandboarding in the dunes, is amazing - mainly for the views over the rolling sea of sand. My one regret is that in 'M Hamid (the last village before the desert, where you spend the first night) we didn't venture into town. There are a few cafes serving desert tourists, but other than that it's a proper desert town with few of the trappings of Western civilisation - we saw it through the windows of our car. You have time for a walk around on the morning of your second day before driving off into the Sahara but we missed out through sheer ignorance.All in all, a wonderful excursion, very worthwhile!"

My brothers and I were in Marrakech for 10 days and the Sahara was definitely the highlight....Abdul was our guide, very friendly, outgoing and knowledgable. Not only to Moha/Abdul and their family operate well-run tours but the family run business only adds to the authenticity since they were born in the Sahara. The trip out to the desert is long so be prepared to drive for hours upon hours...that being said, it is worth it once you arrive at the Erg Chebbi dunes as they are breathtaking. Overall a fun and safe experience....would recommend it to anyone."

I am a college student and was studying abroad in Europe for the summer of 2014. 5 of us (2 girls and 3 boys) really wanted to go to Africa and sleep in the Sahara. We did a lot of research and I ended up contacting Top Desert, and I ended up talking to Moha who is probably the best customer service agent I have ever spoken with. He worked with our cramped time schedule, responded quickly, and answered the million questions I asked about the tour. Our group flew into Casablanca, took a train to Marrakech, and despite the fact that we arrived and hour after we had previously told Moha, our tour guide Sala (not sure of the spelling) was waiting for us at the train station with a sign with my name. The vehicle was super nice (a Four Runner if I remember correctly) and he was a great driver. Very safe. He drove us out of Marrakech and into the Sahara. It is a very long ride, but it seems short and relaxing because we took a break about every hour it seemed to stop at various sites along the way. All of the stops were amazing and even just the scenery while driving was breath taking! After learning a lot about Morocco, eating lunch in front of the kasbah where they filmed Gladiator (so cool), climbing the kasbah, making argon oil, and so much more, we made it out to the desert! The Sahara is awesome! There we arrived at a camp where there was no one but one guy who works there. It was really cool! We rode camels around the dunes, watched the sunset, ate a delicious, homeade (by the two guides) meal, and watched for shooting stars (we saw 5!). In the morning we woke up to see the sunrise (worth it!) and headed back to Marrakech with stops along the way.I really hope to go back and stay longer because a weekend was just enough to fall in love with Morocco! Thank you so much to Top Desert for the trip of a lifetime! I posted some pictures too!"

We didn't expect such a great trip and specially the professionalism of TopDesert tour. During the reservation process we were always guided by Moha. He was very nice and he always answered all of our questions. Our guide Salah was a great guy. He was very respectful and even being the Ramadan days, he always respected us and let us have our snacks during the trip. Even though it was a long trip to the desert, he made several stops to take pictures, to have a coffe or a drink, to use a bathroom or to visit places of interest. This really helped us to stretch once in a while and made the trip much more confortable. Salah always looked for places with internet connection (Wi-Fi), so we could be in contact with our loved ones or to post pictures of our great adventure on Facebook :) The breakfasts and dinners included were delicious tipycal food. The hotel in Dades was phenomenal, the staff was great and the rooms were amazingly decorated and spotless clean. Sincerely, we didn't expect such a great night in the desert, even thought it was very hot during the night, we slept outside the tents under the sky and it was amazing (it is important to remember that a trip to the desert involves sand, high temperatures, bugs and a lot of adrenaline). The experience in the dunes was really magical. We highly recommended this tour. Salah, our guide, was professional, funny and respectful. Thank you Salah and thank you TopDesert tours."

            "review": "3 Day Erg Chebbi Desert Trip. We went on this tour last week. We booked the tour through Moha who answered all our emails and sent us detailed itineraries. Considering what seemed quite a high price for this tour (380 EUR per person), there were some problems. On the day we were picked up at our Riad by our guide (we think his name was Wahid, not sure how to spell it) and then went to meet our driver Rachid. On our way to the hotel for the first night we stopped at a lot of excellent viewpoints which were also good opportunities to stretch our legs as we naively had not realised how much travelling and sitting in the car was involved in the trip. We also stopped at a couple of kasbahs including Ait Benhaddou. We enjoyed these sights and walking round Ait Benhaddou, although felt that our guide did not give us a lot of information about the history of the places. We also stopped at the movie studios in Ouarzazate. Although we didn't want to do the hour-long tour here our guide told us we didn't have the time. This seemed a bit strange as we were then at our hotel for the night by 4:30!The hotel (Xaluca Dades) was fabulous, really nice with great facilities, food, and views. On the second day we also did lots of travelling and stopped and walked around a mosque and 2 spectacular gorges. We were glad to arrive at the desert and were welcomed with some mint tea on our arrival and then straight to our camel ride to watch the sunset. The camel ride in the dunes was amazing, the dunes were very impressive and the local berber guide for the camel ride was very knowledgeable and told us all about the animals he sees in the desert. This was the highlight of our tour. We slept in the tent and had an opportunity to sleep outside. We were told to be at breakfast at eight, at breakfast we were then informed by our guide that it was time to leave. We were confused at this as our itinerary had clearly said sandboarding in the morning which was one of the reasons we had booked this tour. Our guide said that if we had wanted to do the activity we shouldhave gotten up at five when the sand was cooler but this had not been explained to us. After discussion, our guide said that we could go off into the dunes alone to try sandboarding and found us one pair of skis between us to go and try out. This wasn't really what we had in mind as we had no idea what we were doing and were left to our own devices with one pair of skis (and no boots to fit them) between us. This was one of those 'amusingly bad' experiences. Although it was entertaining to see each other fall over on the dunes we were dissappointed to not have any guide, tutoring, or in fact boards for our sandboarding. We had emailed Moha before the trip to confirm with us that we would get the opportunity to try this activity as it may be a once in a lifetime opportunity for us. On the way back we stopped at more places to look at. Overall, we enjoyed the trip and found our guide and driver to be polite but did experience a communication barrier on a couple of occasions as we don't think our guide had understood what we had asked, and perhaps his English was slightly too limited to pass on local and historical knowledge. The dunes and the camel ride were amazing, as were the gorges en route, however we do feel that the itinerary should have been gone through with us by our guide so that everyone was clear on the activities etc. Missing out on a proper sandboarding experience was very disappointing."

He spoke 5 minutes in Ait Benhabbou and after, about Italian movies (did you know there was three periods : realistic, pornographic and realistic ... !!!! ??!!) and education in France\u2026 during 4 days !

And the last day : I give you our riyad adress. They can't find it ! They have to ask to people in the street for help and they tried to mess us around !!! To bamboozle us."

Up through the High Atlas traversing the Tizi n Tichka pass, down the other side to Ait Benhaddou Kasbah. Plenty of stops en route for drinks and photos, and some superb views along the way. Once at our destination we stopped for a meal, then Salah guided us to the summit at Ait Benhaddou. Stunning scenery and fierce heat, so remember to take plenty of water ! Lastly an hour camel ride along the dried up river bed. It felt very special coming back up towards the Kasbah as it loomed up out of the red sand. This is a long day trip (at least 6 hours in the 4x4) but was made entertaining by our hosts Salah and Rachid. We played word games, laughing both at our attempted solutions and at the antics of some of the other road users. Cost was 220 Euros for myself, wife and two teenagers. This was excellent value given the experience that was delivered, but a little long for those with younger children. Would I recommend? Definitely Yes"

It was excellent.I asked them to pick up my family, 2 adults, three large teenagers, at the Kasbah du Toubkal which is located at the base of the Atlas Mountains and 90kms from Marrakesch. (2 nights at this Kasbah, using a guide to go into the Toubkal National Park, highly recommended. Kasbah can arrange transfer from Marrkesch airport).Picked us up in a new, large 4x4 wheel car. With small people can fit 7, with us it was tight but comfortable. All luggage was carried on top of the car, covered with a canvas to avoid the dust and possible rain.We then drove 10 hours to M'Hamid! Our teenagers worst nightmare except that the trip was very interesting. First with the driver and guide who were from the Berber tribe and taught us a lot about the desert. Then we stopped on the way at fascinating places and locations including for lunch.Arrived at M'hamid by night only to find (to my horror) that I had booked the standard hotel (like a one star) instead of the luxury hotel (4 star). As it was my fault I asked them to take me to the 4 star note and I paid the extra charge which was not much. The luxury version of the hotel (you have to remember that M'Hamid is the last town before the deep desert was called Kazbah Azalay and we loved it. Next morning we drove for two hours into the fantastic desert. Started through a sand storm, lunch at an oasis, met berber people on the way and finally reached the impressive dunes where we camped. Moha, who is the person who organizes everything was constantly calling the team to make sure all was OK. The luxury campsite was fully booked so we had the standard campsite. We were able to look a luxury campsite on the way and were happy we got the standard. Luxury campsite si not by the really high dunes (where our kids were able to sand board!) Luxury campsite has a toilet in your tent, but personally I preferred to walk from our tents to a clean little house with several bathrooms. Our camp had approximately 20 tents, with people from all over the world. Food was good and at night we all sat around the campfire with Berber musicians entertaining us. Nights get cool but the (real ) beds in our tents had plenty of blankets. In the morning the must see thing is the sunrise. It is something out of this world. Go early and climb the highest dune for a view you will remember for the rest of your life. We only spent one night. We were able to have a camel ride that was real fun. Had we spent another night we could have explored the desert more and probably hired quads.Drove back through the amazing dried up lake and on the Paris Dakar rally trails. It is a long trip back to Marrakesch but you stop on the way and it was really worth it.I felt safe at all times. Our driver and guide were great."

We're a family of 4 (children age 7&9). Our driver was Racheed who was excellent. A really good driver, so friendly & nice with the children too. He picked us up bang on time. Racheed spoke some English; enough to have little chats & find out where we were going to next etc. Those wanting historical details about the places visited might want a more fluent English speaker, but Racheed was perfect for us.Day 1 we travelled, with stops, for 11 hours. If I'd have read this before, I'd be put off but the stops are frequent and interesting, and the scenery is amazing and varied so we all found the journey fine. We visited an argan oil co-op, a couple of Kasbahs (Ait Benhaddou was excellent, great walk to top of hill, superb views - a good break from the driving). We appreciated the very quick look at the studios in Ouarzazate. Viewing from the outside was interesting enough.Riad Lamane in Zagora was brilliant - beautiful gardens etc. Wish we could have stayed longer.In fact, this bit was the only negative: Day 2, we left at 10am for a drive to M'Hamid, then hang around in a hot cafe for 3 hours waiting for it to cool down enough for the drive off road to Erg Chigaga camp. Would have been better to have an extra 2 hours at riad, (it has a pool that we had no time to use) and only stop in M'Hamid for 1 hour lunch. We had to work hard at keeping kids entertained playing cards etc at the cafe.It took nearly 3 hours of off road driving to reach camp. But it was absolutely worth it. The dunes are beautiful & I couldn't get enough of looking at them in the changing light of day/eve/night. Sandboarding was much fun. Take plenty of water - we could have done with more due to the exertion more than the heat.The camp itself was fab. We had one of about 10 tents. We had beds! And a door! Not what I expected. The marquee type communal tent was nice too, with tables & chairs. The toilets were basic as you'd expect in a desert with little/no water. Although there was a shower & sink it was very basic - take plenty of babywipes for freshening up etc. The food was good - lamb tagine one night, chicken another. Soup to start & fruit after. After dinner the fire was lit & we enjoyed 15mins of drumming & singing by the guys in the camp. Sunset was of course spent up on the dunes. Wow!Day 3 was spent chilling in the desert, as advised my Moha who we booked through. We initially wanted a 3 day trip but Moha thought the children would be better off with more time in the desert before the long car trip back. For us, this did work out best. This was largely due to the presence of a cat & 4 kittens in camp, which kept the kids entertained for hours. The morning was spent in camp, followed by several hours lazing under shade in an oasis 30 mins drive away. We had books, cards, played hopscotch etc so for us it was a nice chilled day but others might have been bored. At 5pm it was cool enough to return to camp for dromedary ride & more sandboarding. Much fun on both counts!Day 4 was the long drive back. We went a different route which was again, surprisingly interesting. We had a few stops: lunch, carpet co-op, Hills Have Eyes film location... but otherwise kept going & were back in Marrakech by 6pm.I'd really recommend top desert. Moha was pretty slick replying to queries by email before we booked. Racheed, our driver, was outstanding. Morocco itself is amazing and there is so much to see, its great to go with a company like Top Desert that take care of everything & obviously know what the are doing."

We decided to go to Morocco during winter time, however the weather was still very nice, sunny and warm. But watch out: the night on the desert is very cold :)Our guides from Top Desert told us a lot of stories and interesting thing about Berber culture. When we got to the camp they cooked for us traditional tajine with chicken and vegebtables and served warm tea whole night.The meal was very tasty. We really enjoyed spending 2 days with them! I recommend Top Desert company! it is worth to book a tour from them! I am attaching some photos from our excellent journey so you can see how was it!"

We called Moha of Top Desert on very short notice, as we wanted to take a tour to Erg Chigaga from Zagora where we were staying. He was able to put a tour together that was perfect for us two. We were picked up by our french speaking driver Hussain from our Riad in Zagora, where he took us to the stunning dunes via M'hamid. The car was a comfortable 4x4, and Hussain clearly a great driver. We arrived at the basic, 10- tent camp that was shared with other guests and other companies, but as comfortable as it gets in the middle of the desert. (They also offer a more luxurious, private camp, but we opted for the shared camp for economical reasons) We took a dromedary ride for about an hour until sunset, which was amazing. The dinner that was prepared was tasty, and the drivers and guides then played us music under the stars. Bring warm pajamas or your own sleeping bag, because it gets very cold at night! Our english speaking guide Mourad joined us between M'Hamid and Erg Chigaga, very nice guy and fun to talk to. Including tips, we paid about 2300 dirham for the two day - one night trip, and it was worth every penny."

We arranged a 3 day / 2 night tour through Top Desert from Marrakech to the Sahara. The person who handles all of the arrangements (Moha) did an excellent job of communicating and setting up the tour for us over email. At first, we were only planning a 1 night tour to the Tinfou dunes but Moha strongly suggested a 2 night tour to the Erg Chegaga dunes. This is the BEST advice we could have received. We drove past the Tinfou \"dunes\" for the 1 night tour and then I totally understood why he strongly suggested a 2 night tour or longer. I think we would have been really disappointed if we only did the 1 night tour.Our tour guide (Abdul) was absolutely amazing. We spent 3 full days with him and could not have been more happy. The first day and the last day were long days of driving including windy roads through the mountains and offroad driving in the desert. We made nice stops along the way which were very interesting to see and learn about. But for sure the highlight is the time in the desert. Abdul was absolutely fantastic and took such great care of us! It was all perfect! I cannot recommend this tour enough.One last note, my wife and I have a 1 year old child and we were very glad that we left him at home with his grandparents for this trip. It is a lot of driving including offroad driving through the desert. This was so fun for us but definitely better for couples and/or families with older children."

Yes, 12 days all over Morocco, with meet-ups in Rabat to pick up and drop off my son. I made all arrangements with Moha via e-mail. My son lives in Rabat and we are in the USA. There were quite a few places my son wanted us to visit. Moha met every challenge I gave him without a hitch and filled in the rest of our vacation with a wonderful assortment of experiences. We didn't have to worry about a thing from the time our driver picked us up at the airport until the end of our tour. They took care of every detail. All accommodations were perfect, travel arrangements were perfect, desert trip was perfect. If it had not rained in Fez, I would have guessed that Moha even arranged the weather for us!!! Moha was a most gracious person to deal with and he went out of his way to meet our requests and make us feel so welcomed in his country. Our guide and driver, Abdoul, was awesome! He was polite and helpful in every way, almost sensing our needs and yet he was never intrusive. He was knowledgeable and answered all our questions. He seemed to know exactly when we needed a break - pulling over to the side of the road for a fantastic view or to stop for a cup of tea. He was a wonderful driver as well, especially through the Atlas mountains (breath-taking views along with breath-taking curves). He recommended fantastic places to eat, shop or just take a walk. He even took us on a late night run to the store and found us some camel milk! He is such a patient person with a great sense of humor. He was always smiling! It was such a pleasure to have him with us on our journey! Moha also set us up with a local guide, Syed, in the old city of Marrakesh. Syed was great and is very knowledgeable! He explained many of the nuances of Moroccan culture and customs along with traditions and their roots. We also had a local guide in Fez.I just can't say enough about Top Desert. All of the staff we worked with were kind, generous, patient and AWESOME! They took care of everything for us. Moha always responded quickly when we were in the planning stages. We had absolutely no problems. I think we traveled about 2000km and the car (4x4) was very comfortable. Abdoul was an excellent and safe driver. All of the riads they reserved for us were great. The excursions and experiences we had will last us a lifetime!"

We agreed on a 2-day desert tour, which was a great choice (on the beaten track, not where all tour groups go). We ended up to be the only couple at our camp and enjoy the company. The guides were knowledgeable, friendly and did everything to accomodate our needs (they kept on asking if it was ok for my wife).While likely not the cheapest outfit out there, you will get a very reliable company that will deliver a fantastic, no-bad-surprises trip."

From Marrakech we really wanted to go into the desert but didn't have that much time. Top Desert arranged a trip that was perfect for our needs. It was easily arranged and we were taken care of the whole time. Our driver into the desert (Mahjoub) was excellent and the scenery was gorgeous. He was very friendly and we learnt so much about Moroccan culture and people. Driving through the High Atlas Mountains and seeing how Moroccans live there was unbelievable. Our time in the desert was beautiful, even though we didn't go that far into the Sahara. Everyone took care of us and it was (almost) the best accommodations of our trip, considering we were in the desert. It was a very unique experience and gave us a whole different view of Morocco. The sunset and sunrise was gorgeous and we spent the night around the campfire listening to the staff sing and play instruments. It is definitely an incredible experience that is worth trying out when visiting Morocco. I would recommend going farther into the desert and taking two to three days if you want a more real experience of the desert. I would definitely go again with Top Desert and I hope to do so again in the future. They have many options available and are happy to help you find the right one for you."

The organization and planning went well without a hitch. Our tour guide was a Berber very knowledgeable of the desert and a good driver. He was gentle in giving us advices and we changed to stay in a hotel instead of the original plan to camp two nights, due to the summer heat in high 40 C in July month.

It was amazing and admirable our driver/guide took good care of us whilst observing his Ramadan (without food and water during the day). The scenery was unbelievable and the food was fantastic.

Moha responded to our questions in a timely manner and arranged for us to be collected at the airport in Marrakech and driven to our riad.

Once we saw where the riad was, right in the middle of the Medina, we quickly understood why! Moha also arranged a separate guide, Said, who guided us around the Medina for the only afternoon we had available in Marrakech. He was a wealth of knowledge and looked after our every need and we felt very safe with him. He also showed us how to find our way to and from our riad, at our request, and we would highly recommend Said to anyone who wanted to hear about some of the history of Marrakech. Thank you Said!We would really like to thank Abdoul (our driver) & Mourad (our guide) who were very kind and caring during our 3 day trip to the dunes.

We had an excellent time with our great guides, Abdoul and Majoub (2 comfy aircon cars) who accommodated many photo stops. They turned up at our Riad on time and returned us efficiently to a well hidden riad on our return to Marrakech.The journey south took us through fantastic scenery and we ate typical tasty Moroccan food. We over nighted in a secluded desert camp site (south of Foum-Zguid), accessed by camel ride into the sunset.A simple meal was followed by a berber jam session, with a bit of Les Mis from our kids. We slept under the stunning desert stars as the tents were too hot, although our concerns of night crawlers were not realised. Be aware of the sand getting under the sheets though if the wind picks up! We all watched the sunrise whilst attempting dune surfing, followed by a second camel trek as the sun rose further over the mountains. Breakfast, showers and a swim at a nearby hotel was greatly appreciated.The outward trip over the high Atlas mountains visited the remote but beautiful Kazbah Des Glaoui at Telouet, still decked in stunning original mosaic (similar to India's Agra style), not expected from the outside image of a semi ruin. The return trip took us through scenery as stunning as the Utah desert. Our short trip did not allow an extended visit to Ait Ben Haddou although we passed by and stopped for lunch. 2 other stops allowed for rug buying and Argan oil testing.Thank you to Abdoul and Majoub for an exciting and cultural trip!"

After a long time surfing on the internet we booked our 4 day trip to the desert with Top Desert. There are so many tour operators who offer you trips to the Sahara what makes it difficult to pick one. When we planned our vacation to Morocco and the excursion we had some questions, and Moha helped us by email before we booked our desert trip. That gave us a very good idea about the organisation. They helped you wherever they could.Abdoul was our driver and guide during the four days and we liked him all very much. Great sence of humour, a perfect driver and he thought a lot about the wishes of our four children! He told us a lot about Morocco, his culture and living in the desert. He knew the most beautiful views for the photo's and he showed us a lot of amazing places.Near Erg Chebbi, we stopped at a well where the children could get water for the camels to drink, they were resting in the sun. It was a magnificent and refreshing moment! Now we are back home, one of the best memories left of our wonderful vacation.The camel ride to see the sunset, the colours of the Sahara, sleeping under the stars and even a little sandstorm made our desert experience complete and very special. It was a magical evening and night in the desert. Abdoul, his colleague Lachzen and some boys who work their made Berber music for us, and we tried to played some instruments and although we have to confess we are bad musicians, we joined and made a lot of fun, and even learned a Berber dance, It was a perfect evening in the desert.We are so glad that we chose Top Desert!

Even though I was a solo traveller, and he couldn't find another group for me to go with, he arranged a private trip for me within my budget. I was worried about my safety since I was traveling alone so he personally came to the Riad I was staying at to explain everything to me. He made me feel so comfortable which was a breath of fresh air after how I was treated by the taxistas, people in the Souks and in the streets of Marrakesh. He arranged for his brother Rachid to take me on the 3 day tour to the desert and back, door to door service. Rachid was amazing! He stopped at all the great places to take pictures and he always had my comfort and well-being in mind. He speaks several languages (Berber, Arabic, French and Spanish) and was well-versed in the areas we travelled through. After going through several cool cities and seeing century old Kasbahs, we arrived to the Gorges du Dades and stayed the night at the lovely Albuerge Chez Pierre. The people there were equally kind to me and the meals were fabulous! The next day, when we arrived at the desert, the people Rachid and Abdu work with were so also nice and hospitable. I was so impressed with the sheer beauty and serenity of the area. Everything everybody says about this particular 3-day trip is true, so many gorgeous things to see and eat! I would HIGHLY recommend this tour with Rachid and/or Abdu without a single doubt in my mind! I loved every single minute of it and am so glad I chose them!~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~On another note, after telling Rachid all about my bad experiences walking around Marrakesh alone, he accompanied me everywhere!

Abdu was a great driver and spoke perfect English. He took us to all of the best spots for photo taking and we stayed in very lovely hotels. He was funny and we all had a relaxing yet adventurous trip. The price was reasonable and I would highly recommend Top Desert Trip."

After serveral days in Marrakech it was time for some outside the walls exploring, but what to you really do with a 3.5 kid on the backseat? Call TD Tours, which offered childseat in fourwheel drive 10 hours back and fourth day trip to Ait Benhaddou with the picturesque drive over the pass thru desert dry and sometime oasis beautiful surroundings watching the day go by, by the locals with no forced stops to shop and drop. Incredibly safe driving taking into account the curvie and narrow roads etc. The site is what is is, but thumbs up for vehicle and the drive....and his music, Tinariwen from Mali, simply top notch crusing the 4 hours from A to B. Pricey yes, You can get cheaper locals for 40% off if knowing the right people, but then again if you pay peanuts you get monkeys."

He felt like a close companion on a long road trip. He saved us the hassle of navigating Moroccan roads, traffic and an unexpected sand storm. The southern oasis route and desert dunes were the highlight. We very much appreciated that Abdel asked us to dine with the other Berbers after we asked to cook a tagine together. We will always have fond memories."

I booked a trip with these guys as a single woman going alone into the desert for 3 days 2 night private tour with sandboarding, camel riding, and into the desert tent camp. They met me the night before we left at my hotel and we discussed plans, concerns, and travel arrangements. They picked me up the next day in a beautiful Land Rover. Their English is great for discussing the country and culture. We travelled a long distance to the first town, where we had beautiful accomodations in a gorgeous riad. The second day we went into the heart of the desert and stayed at a magical tent camp with delicious food and memories I'll never forget. Halfway through the trip, I realized I was no longer traveling alone... I was traveling with friends. These 2 guys, Moha and Abdou, are amazing... good friends who have gone in together to create a top notch business that provides a magical experience for their customers. I felt safe and cared for the entire trip. We would stop on the way when we'd see something neat on the side of the road. I'd recommend this company to anyone and can't wait until I can get back to Morocco so I can book another adventure with them. Highly, highly recommended!"

We travelled on a small relatively well air conditioned mini bus with 9 other people and our guide. The trip to the desert took 12 hours by bus and 2 hours on a camel. The journey out to the desert involved many stops to take pictures and for toilet breaks. On arrival to the desert we were welcomed with mint tea and a lovely tagine supper. We then spent hours lying under the stars before heading to sleep in our tent which we shared with another couple. We visited in June and at night the desert was still really hot and the temperature in our tent was quite uncomfortable, so don't worry about taking warm clothing with you. We woke at 6am to watch a beautiful sunrise and then headed back on the camels for one hour where we met the main road and our guide was waiting for us. The journey home took approximately 6 hours. All the roads to and from Zagora are very winding and I would recommend anti sickness for anyone who suffers from travel sickness. There are lots of opportunities to buy water along the way, and it's not necessary to purchase a cloth to wear as a head scarf when riding the camels, regardless of how much it is insisted on. Overall this was an absolutely amazing trip and I would recommend it to everyone as a must do tour whilt in morocco."

We went on an excellent hike up a mountain trail which was a bit scary at times but the view from the top was stunning and well worth the effort.

Morocco Attractive Tours did an excellent job of conveying that experience to us. The 4 valleys tour is an excellent day trip. An early start ensures you beat the crowds at the waterfall and the lunch with a Berber family is delicious. The scenery is spectacular.Helpful tips:1. The hike to the waterfall can be challenging in places, wear sensible shoes.2. Bring loose change for souvenirs or tips for the Berber family. 3. If your a woman, wear something to cover your legs. Berber tradition is still quite conservative and short shorts could be offensive. My partner brought a light scarf and wore it as a saarong."

We just been 6 person and this made the trip even more special! Abdoul told us a lot about the country, history and the people! He speaks perfectly English! We stopped in a lot of places to enjoy the landscape and meet people who are leaving in the mountains! It was incredible! We stopped in an 'argan oil' production and got some information about the production and gained inside the working area! Afterwards we stopped again to visit the waterfall in Setti Fadma. The walk up to the waterfall was surround with a great view and people who are living there. Amazing! Abdoul took us to a great place in a typical family house in the mountains! Perfect view, perfect food, perfect environment and atmosphere! The food was the best food we had tried during our stay in Marokko! All in all it was a perfect tour and it is for sure that you will learn a lot about the people and visit typical places in the countryside! Thanks a lot to Abdoul! He made the tour very special!

He arrived promptly at our riad at 8am in a nice 4*4. It was just my wife and I plus our 2 teenagers. The trek up to the waterfall was rather wet - despite the forecast for Marrakesh being dry, it rained most of the walk. The local guide, Omar, was very helpful particularly when the rocks were slippy. He also gave us a simple plastic poncho although without a hood. My advice is to wear trainers and take a jacket. The scenery changes across the 4 valleys - plenty of photo opportunities. The Berber lunch was the highlight. It was really interesting eating in the house of a local family, and the meal was delicious. Even my 14 year old daughter enjoyed it, and she normally only eats pizza on holiday!I highly recommend the trip. "

Fantastic guide, great English, very funny made a real effort with our small group making us laugh whilst educating us about Berber culture. Stopped at a argan shop where they show you how it's made, good loo stop!On to the first valley where we took a hike for an hour or so, no real path in places so trainers a must, not for the elderly but instead they can sit in one of the lovely little cafe stops and wait for the remainder of the group. Some small stalls selling usual Moroccan wares but no pressure at all to buy.Incredible small cafe to take green mint tea or a soft drink high up on a mountain side, accessing it involves a ladder which is fun. The guide helped assist where needed if you felt unsteady or needed a hand. Incredible views and fab photo opportunities. After this we travelled though the other valleys and stopped for an amazing lunch prepared by a Berber family in a house in a small village. Again fantastic views and settings, tagine, cous cous, salad, bread and fruits and tea to finish. Back to our hotel around 530.Highly recommend!"

We stopped often for photo opportunities but some of the latter valleys and an artificial dam meant we sat a lot in the car and didn't see too much that was different.The first half was awesome though, even when raining for a few hours. We visited a Argan museum for a bit, and then climbed up a waterfall for great pictures. The highlight without a doubt is the lunch with a local Berber family. The authentic local tagine and couscous was the best I've ever tasted and spending time in their home meant they got some income through the tour and we got excellent food.The second half of the tour tailed off with the scenery relatively average throughout.

The drive to Ourzazate was absolutely gorgeous through the Atlas mountains and Mustafa even took us on a bit of an off-road route; some of the turns were a bit hairy but if you enjoy a little adventure, its an absolutely breathtaking detour from the usual highway route. During our trip, Mustafa was an absolutely hilarious travel companion and always kept things light and friendly. We really enjoyed our time with him and would highly recommend his services."

We were picked up on time in a comfortable vehicle by our excellent guide and taken on the short drive up into the Atlas Mountains. My wife and I particularly enjoyed the trek to the waterfall. It was quite slippery in parts and perhaps this should be made more clear to participants up front who may be less adventurous. However the highlight was the delicious lunch in a Berber family house with an incredible location and scenic view. Many excellent photos later we were back safely at our Riad. Definitely recommended"

Our friendly chauffeur and guide Chakib spoke English very well and had nice facts about everything we saw. Also he stopped every now and then for us to take pictures. The mountain trekking guide was a bit harder to understand but was nice and took good care of us. You will pass souvenir shops on your way during the trekking, but mainly it is a nice climb with beautiful views. Tip: wear shoes with decent soles (for a good grip).The other valleys were also beautiful to see, but the experience I loved the most was the lunch at a Berber family. The man of the house is the son of the imam in a tiny village. Amazing view and amazing food!!! I will always dream about that insanely good tajine ! "

            "review": "AMAZING!. This trip was the highlight of our holiday in Morocco. My friend and I were picked up near our Riad by the most wonderful tour guide named ABDILLAH. Our group consisted of 6 people. We drove up to the Amazigh (Not Berber) village and just saw the most amazing views with Abdillah explaining everything in detail. He speaks excellent English and is very knowledgeable about the history and information of Morocco and other things around the world. Then we stopped at an argan women's cooperative which I was not too crazy about. The woman explaining the process made me feel like I was in an infomercial. But it was good to see the process. I would say this was the only 'meh' of the trip.After that we drove to the mountain area and were led by Omar, also wonderful, tracking up and down the mountains and stopping at the beautiful waterfall. You will definitely need hiking boots or sports shoes for the climbing. After climbing up then down we met up with Abdillah again and he drove us to the home of the son of the Imam in a village to have an amazing tajin lunch with the most spectacular view. It did get a bit windy so you might need something light.We then drove to the surrounding valleys and finally dropped off at our Riad. Again, this is a highly recommended trip with amazing views and a great tour guide!"

The trip was arranged via email and the communication was faultless. We paid on the day of our trip. We received an email the day before the trip to arrange pick up and meal requirements. We arranged to meet our guide by one of the gates as we were staying inside the Medina. Our driver picked us up, on time as arranged, in a nice 4x4 vehicle. Our driver/guide Mustafa was lovely, helpful and charming. He was very informative and pointed out landmarks and other points of interest along the way. We drove over the Atlas Mountains and the visited Ouarzazate & Ait Benhaddou. We also visited the films set for some famous movies & TV programmes, Gladiator, Cleopatra and Game of Thrones. We then headed to Kasbah and had a traditional lunch at Kasbah Tebi. Our guide then took us through the Kasbah giving us lots of information about its history along the way. We walked to the top of the hill and the views were fantastic. On the way back our guide stopped and bought us Apples and nectarines from the roadside fruit sellers so we could taste the local produce. Our trip started at 7.30am and we returned at 8.30pm great value for money. We couldn't fault our day in anyway and this was all credit to our wonderful guide Mustafa. I recommend this company to anyway wanting a quality service and value for money."

We booked through British Airways but you can book direct with them. They pick up from your hotel / riad if you are outside the medina. The Atlas mountains believe it or not are very touristy & busy. Abdul our driver took us up there earlier than most companies so we missed the rush. After doing the walk to the waterfalls (which is rough and not suitable for those who have walking difficulties) we took off on a different route to other trips and barely saw another vehicle for the rest of our trip.Abdul our driver was very knowledgeable about the mountains as he grew up in the area. He spoke excellent English and made sure we all had a marvellous time.Apart from the amazing scenery we had lunch in a Berber house, it was incredible. The food was excellent and this was the real deal not a tourist trap. We were fascinated by the amount of trees, peach, plum, nut trees and apples trees.I highly recommend to use this company. They kept in contact with us regarding pick up times etc and it was well worth the money. Talking to others who had booked directly with our hotel we had a far superior trip and much better value.Thank you for such a lovely day."

We had a salad to start (with bread which seems to be a staple all times of the day in this neck of the woods) followed by a tagine (with more bread if you weren't breaded up already!)

We had a completely brilliant day trip with Chakib to the Three Valleys with a wee hike to a waterfall with a local guide, Omar, who was also excellent. We visited Argan oil producers to find out more about that process and also to give you a chance to buy something if you wanted, although there was no pressure selling. We had an *incredible* lunch at a traditional Berber house in the mountains with a completely stunning view, and got a small window into local life.Chakib was really fantastic-spoke excellent English and we all felt very safe with his driving (which isn't something you can say about every driver!). He was always willing to stop for pictures and answered all our wide-ranging questions. He was very knowledgable. The car was well maintained, clean and cool and very comfortable.We really felt that we had a special day out, getting off the tourist highway to small villages a big tour could never reach. We felt incredibly well looked after all day. The booking process was very easy and all-in-all the day was superb value for money.I can't recommend this company, Chakib and the tour highly enough.Thank you Morocco Attractive Tours!!"

Our guide was very intelligent and went the extra mile to make our day a day to remember. it was such an amazing feel to climb up the mountain by foot to see the amazing waterfalls, something that that I wanted to see since childhood, can't believe my dream came true, my family and i even went in the water fall just couldn't go to where the water was falling from the mountain as we didn't take extra clothing with us, if i'd know i would've definitely took extra clothing, my advise to people going to the mountain tour is take extra clothing then you can really get under the waterfall and enjoy to the fullest. Our car guide was a really wonderful person and spoke very good English language. He took us up to the highest point of the mount with his four by four and even helped some people who got stuck in the road. We also had a morocon meal at a families home which was delicious. I would highly recommend this three valleys mountain trip, if I go again I will definitely do this again, this take extra clothing."

We initially booked the day trip to Essouira straight from the airport with Morocco Attractive tours, and the pickup worked flawlessly with Abdoul retrieving us, rolling into a big black Prado toward the seaside port. The afternoon was full of memorable moments, from my mom picking up a mountain of argan oil creams and nut spreads and soaps (and my mom isn't girly!) from a woman-run cooperative, to my dad happily snapping away pictures of me holding an adorable 10-day-old baby goat in front of the famous argan trees filled with goats (that picture was worth a thousand Facebook likes), and to photographing the colorful city from atop an old fortress on the sea. My parents RAVED about this trip, so we knew we had to book another one, and with Abdoul! The next trip was even BETTER! The three valley trip to the Atlas Mountains is going to stick with us for the rest of our lives. You haven't lived until you have eaten the most delicious tagine in the world, with ingredients made in the tiny mountain-top village where you stopped for lunch, eating at a table overlooking stunning million-dollar views. Fifteen minutes further down the mountain, Richard Branson has his ridiculously luxe hotel with helipad built, but it doesn't even come close to breathtaking views that the place had where we ate lunch, with a local Berber family who invite guests into their home. My dad can't wait to start looking through the bajillion photos he took. Highly recommend this tour operator, and especially Abdoul for his knowledge, clear passion for his country and his people, service with a smile. I know my parents will hire this company again on their next trip back--there is still so much to see and do in Morocco!"

We took this trip today with a driver Mr Abdul.Our trip started 7:30 has planned the guide was very pontual the travel to Ouarzazate was in a nice 4x4 Jeep. The guide was very friendly all the trip and always telling history costumes of Marocco. So it was wonderfull a true history live story. We stop for a coffe a toillets before we start to cross the valley. After that we stop to see local vilage and took some nice photos. You can see old people working in the farms and with goats... The view its wonderfulll trust it you will lose breathe. After that we went to Ouarzazate saw the local kasbah its good and you can take nice pictures of localconstruction. We prefered not to visit the studios because that was not the meaning of out trip we prefered local sights views and marocco things. After the visit to Ouarzazate we lunch in very good and also cheap place where they have european food. Abdul was kind to show us this place because we were tire of local marocco food.Next we got in car and went to Kasbah Ait BenHadoo This Unesco Place its worderfull local ancient village very old style we took Abdul advice took some water because the journey to the higher point with 40degrees you will need fresh water.We took excelent phots and stand to ser desert river and this wonderfull place. After that we return to Marrakech always talking to Abdul about diferences between Portugal and Marocco and history of these countries. This 3 hour trip was again a great history talk where me and my girlfriend learn alot abou marocco words food and traditons.ResumeTrip GreatDriver Very professional Helpfull and speaks very well englishThanks for the great dayRegards Joao and Helena"

My boyfriend and I booked the Atlas Mountains 3 Valleys tour using the get your guide website/app and it was very well organised with confirmation emails detailing time of pick up etc. We were greeted at our hotel 5 minutes early by Mostafa who was wonderful right from the minute we got in the car to when he dropped us back at the hotel. He was VERY funny but also knowledgeable and easy going. Wherever we wanted to stop for photos, he stopped for us. The tour itself was great, we enjoyed the sights of the Ourika, Oukaimeden and Asni Valleys which were honestly quite stunning. The highlight of the tour was the traditional Moroccan lunch with a Berber family. The tagine was the best I've ever tasted and the views over the valley were incredible. Overall, an amazing experience and one that we'll never forget. Many thanks to Mostafa for making it a special day!"

We were picked up on time from our Riad, accompanied by our very respectful and knowledgeable guide and met our small group members, making four of us which was very convenient and personalized. The scenery, the views of green valleys, trekking the waterfall, taking pictures, Argan oil extraction visit, and crossing a bridge over the river were all things we've done in the first valley visit, Ourika! Then we went to the second valley through an off road that was not touristic where we saw Berber villages in the mountains, some even without windows that made us wonder of the tough life they live and the luxurious blessings we're surrounded with. There we had a delicious lunch with a kind Berber family in their house that has a breathtaking view over the mountains and was very authentic and clean. We didn't really \"do\" the last valley, that we just drove by and took some pictures of a famous resort there. There was an option to visit the artificial lake and the green plateaus, but our group members were exhausted after lunch and long day that we didn't take the extended version- yet I wish I had. Our guide was amazing, caring, knowledgeable and respectful. It's worth every penny. Not taking this trip means missing a lot of marrakech experience."

Second, he is efficient and his suv was very comfortable. Third, his knowledge is amazing. The waterfall tour was amazing (though not as physically easy as one might assume). Lunch in the Berber home was by far the most delicious meal I have eaten in months and I am clamoring to go back. Finally, the scenery was shockingly beautiful.

Great communication with the company (Sara) from the start and when in Morocco they were very accommodating when we had to postpone and reschedule the trip due to sickness of a family member.On the day we were met by Shakib on time and at the designated meeting point. We were a party of 4 and collected another couple nearby.Shakib spoke English very well and explained what the day had in store and continued to provide good commentary throughtout the day and answered all our questions.The itinerary for the day is pretty much as detailed in other reviews. On arrival at the first valley and where the waterfall is, we were introduced to our local guide who took us up the mountain to see the waterfall. Must say that without him some of us would not have got up the mountain. He was patient and very helpful and his cost was included in the overall price.The timing to the first valley was spot on as the crowds were building as we made our way down from the mountain and as we left the valley the traffic was increasing and I suspect if we tried the mountain climb any later it would have been manic.The lunch at the Berber house was excellent. Much has been said previously, but the food, our hosts and location were excellent. We had lunch with another party also from Morocco Attractive Tours. We will never forget the beautiful scenery and to top it all there was thunder in the background as light storm clouds gathered in the distance, but no rain. The trip continued to the last valley with plenty of stop offs for photos as required. Arrived back in Marrakeche on schedule. Overall an excllent day trip with a friendly and knowledgable guide who was professional, drove safely and we never felt rushed during the day. Thank you Morocco Attractive Tours."

He helped us all climb up and really cared about our safety. I would most definitely recommend this tour company as they are professional and start early at 8am so that you avoid the rush in the hiking part. This company is the only company who offer lunch in a traditonal berber house free of charge. It was a wonderful experience and I highly recommend using this company and asking for Chakib.

            "review": "Three Valleys . The company were good about arranging the pick up time and place as it can be difficult to make contact when abroad. They rang me back when I couldn't get through to confirm the day before and also rang me on the morning of the pick up to keep me updated on the arrival time of the driver.The morning started well with the happy smiling face of Abdul, our driver and guide. Although the trip was for 6 there were only 2 other people in the spacious and comfy minibus. Sunil from Paris and Emile from Tunis. My two children and I do not speak French but Abdul was brilliant at giving commentaries in French and English. He started even before we had left Marrakech with some background of the trip ahead and interesting details about the city as we were leaving it.Abdul knew good places to stop for photo opportunities along the way and gave good advice about the custom and practices of the street traders before we encountered them at the view points.We first stopped at the women's Argan oil collective. Very interesting to see how they use all of the plant without waste, even the husks of the nuts are used for animal feed. There are many products for sale from honey made from the flowers to cooking oil and cosmetics made from the nuts. Again the women spoke both English and French.Next was the trek up to the waterfall. It is about a half hour climb and is very steep and demanding. You will need stout footwear and a fair amount of energy to get up. Abdul handed us over to another guide for this bit. He too was very pleasant and helpful, with a hand up over the steepest and most slippery bits. I was amazed to see people carrying small children up here. At the top is a little cafe next to the lovely waterfall. I was also amazed to learn that all of the products for sale have to be carried up the same way we climbed. Nearly everybody takes shoes and socks off for a paddle in the pool. On the way down we stopped at the village craft co-operative. All the money raised from sales is shared fairly amongst the whole village. Worth a look around the craft stalls. After that, back in the minibus. Although it is climate controlled we sometimes chose to have the windows open. Next the scenic route to lunch. Many photo opportunities and Abdul would stop on request. He is very knowledgeable about the area and has done his job for some years. The guide books say not to give children gifts but apparently sweets, small coins and water during school holidays is okay.The Berber house was fascinating. Made from mud and straw and in a small village in the mountains, the women there managed to produce a huge feast, not just for our party but also for another group. We started with bread and olive oil with tomato and onion salad. Be careful not to fill up on that though because it is followed by tagine (my daughter had vegetarian by prior arrangement), then we were brought vegetable couscous with melon and mint tea to finish. Our table could not finish all the food. The surroundings and view for our meal were charming.The return trip past Jebel Toubkal, the highest mountain in the Atlas mountains and 2nd highest in Africa, was also spectacular. Abdul kept up his bilingual commentary all the way back to Marrakech. Even once back in the city he still had interesting facts to share about the palm trees.The two others were dropped at their hotel door. We were dropped as close to our Riad as a vehicle can get.I would thoroughly recommend this tour if you are in Marrakech and want to escape to the mountains for a day. Looking forward to our trip tomorrow to Ouarzazate."

It is along day and we went in July and it was very hot once out of the mountains so be warned particularly with children. The van was new comfortable, clean and the a/c worked properly and waiting for us when we arrived at the pick up a good all round start. Our guide / driver Abdul was excellent local to the mountains we were passing through, spoke perfect English (a big plus as This is often not the case here) and very knowledgable. The rest stops he chose on route were all immaculately clean and he stopped at the ideal photo points. He was not pushy but gave us the opportunity to buy when we wanted and spend extra time where we wanted, the secret of successful small group / private tours.The mountains and Ait Benhaddou are stunning and well worth the visit Ouarzazate less so but that's where Ait Benhaddou is. Ben Haddou is a world heritage site appropriately restored not overrun , in July anyway and some unusual souvenir opportunities, for example the burnt paintings. On the way back we had the opportunity to buy pure Argan oil directly from a women's cooperative. One of our party was sick in the bus on the return, this was dealt with by Abdul with the perfect mix of sympathy and efficiency, by the time we had finished with the sick person and ready to move on the interior of the bus including our bags etc had been cleaned and there was no smell left on the remaining journey. A job well done. With these small group tours the guide makes or breaks the tour and Abdul certainly made ours."

Highlights of the trip include:- A short hike (approximately 20 minutes each way) to a local waterfall at the head of the first valley, Ourika.- Visiting a woman's compound where Argan oil products are processed with a range of cosmetic and culinary products are available- Taking a traditional Moroccan meal in a remote Berber village along the second Valley, Tahnaout (which was delicious and a bargain at only 120Dh)- Taking in the sights including North Africa's second highest peak, Toubkal, along the thrid valley, Asni.

We went to the Ouzoud Waterfalls, our driver was Mustafa he made the 4hours driving there and back an absolute dream, he was so funny and talkative and was so relaxing! Me and my girlfriend felt so relaxed and happy without him the drive would have felt like forever, he was happy to stop and let us take pictures and everything nothing was a problem for him! Such a great man couldn't have asked for more!!!As for when we got to the waterfalls them self we were met by another brilliant man! His name was Ibrahim, a Berber native of the waterfalls for 17years! He knew everything there was to know about the place and spoke completely perfect English we thought he was from London haha!! He took us off the normal tourist route to show us all the olive trees and explain the color system etc, then took us to the oldest Berber house at the falls and gave us a tour which was amazing! He took us the long route round explaining everything on the way taking pictures for us and of us which was so nice of him! We took a long swim in the waterfalls and then lunch overlooking them - 3 course for 100mad! Bargain and super tasty! Our highlight was taking the little boat to under the waterfall and swimming in the waterfall where the water hits the bottom that was sensational and Ibrahim was taking pictures of us on his own back! We also got to meet WILD Monkeys! Came and climbed on us and gave us hugs etc and taking watermelon ( which Ibrahim had kindly bought to give to them). All in all this trip is an absolute must if your in Marrakech and you just have to go with this company! Couldn't fault in any way and cannot praise enough for everything! Thank you so much guys you made our holiday completely with this day your amazing!!!"

We did a 2 day tour to Ouarzazate to take in Ait Ben Haddou and to visit some of the old Kasbahs in that area. 2 days was a bit rushed, as we realised that you spent more time in the car than out, however, the scenery is without a doubt stunning.We had Abdoul as our guide who arrived spot on at the meeting point/time. He drove us over the infamous pass stopping at various vantage points to take in the mountain ranges and villages dotted around the mountain side.We drove to the Telouet valley to reach Telouet Kasbah. It costs 20DHM to get in per person and then you have to pay a guide 50DHM. I know it's not alot in pounds, but we kind of felt it wasn't value for money. Parts of the interior were beautful as the mosaics were still intact, but the guide's English wasn't that great, so he didn't really bring the story about the Kasbah and its history to life. We then had lunch in Telouet which was a tasty chicken tagine, but quite expensive (130DHM each) compared to prices you pay in Marakech, but one can only assume it's down to the fact that you are in the middle of nowhere. We were in fact, the only tourists there!We then went to Ait Ben Haddou where we stayed overnight at Riad Maktoub. As we were there late afternoon, the place was pretty quiet and Abdoul told us the way to reach the top. Unfortunately, it was an extremely windy day, so we didn't get a chance to sit and watch the sun go down from the top. We did however, manage to get some stunning shots of the different colours of the buildings as the sun went down.The following day, we briefly visted Ouarzazate and went to the Kasbah and the Cinema museum opposite it. After that, we went to Fint Oasis and visited a local Berber house, where mint tea was served and then it was back in the car for the long drive back to Marakech with a pit stop en route for lunch.I have to admit, not sure why anyone would do this as a day trip, as doing an overnight, doesn't really allow you enough time to get a better feel for the place. I reckon 2 nights in the region would be better to allow you to really soak up the feel of the place, which is different to uber busy Marrakech."

The tour guide and the guide in the berber village were incredibly helpful and friendly spoke superb English and we're very helpful when I had problems with my knee and couldn't get down from the waterfall. Prices in the village crafts are very much more reasonably priced then in marrakesh. The food in traditional berber home was so much better than I thought it would be. Much better than the moroccan food my hotel was providing. Wish I could have spent 7 days there instead of the city."

A beautiful drive (in the comfort of a four by four) was split up with regular stops along the way to soak up the wonderful surroundings. The highlights were a hike to some waterfalls and lunch in a Berber village with stunning views across the valley.

The lunch which was served at a house on top of a village with amazing views over a valley in the high atlas...I have never eaten anywhere with such an incredible view...and the food was delicious, home cooked, homegrown, authentic Moroccan cuisine.

The day before the tour I received an email from Sara at Morocco Attractive tours letting me know the weather was looking to be bad and if we wanted we could reschedule or go somewhere else. They offered another excursion that would be just as nice. I was really impressed by this service because they went out of their way to accomodate due to weather and also to ensure we had a great time. I have never had a company do this and I was beyond impressed! We stayed with the tour to Ouzoud and decided we would deal with the weather if it did rain.This tour is very informative. Our driver Abdul was prompt, professional, and informative. On the way to Ouzoud he was able to answer any questions we had on the city of Marrakech and Ouzoud. I was very impressed with his knowledge. On other tours I have experienced drivers just get you to the destination without much interaction but not Abdul he was very kind and enjoyed teaching us about his country. When we arrived at Ouzoud Falls we were greeted by our guide for the day Abraham who was very nice. His English was very impressive! He was able to teach us a great deal about the Berbers, the Berber community and Ouzoud. We also enjoyed a nice hike through the mountain stopping at a nice Argan oil shop where they make it all by hand. Great experience! The restaurant we went to next to the falls was very nice, inexpensive with great food. There are so many tours that go to Ouzoud but this one was more personable than a large tour bus that only drops you off. I loved this tour. I give this company 5 stars for a job well done. I'm so glad we decided on going with this company."

My day in the Atlas Mountains was the highlight of my trip to Morocco, and it was all because of Morocco Attractive Tours. Prior to my day trip of the three valleys (booked via Viator) Sara from Morocco Attracive Tours emailed me to confirm my pick-up time and location, which I really appreciated. Our guide, Chakib, arrived right on time and took us to the three valleys where he provided us with plenty of facts and figures about each of the valleys we'd be visiting. Chakib was so kind to everyone, and always made sure we were comfortable and accommodated everyone on the tour really well (he's also a great photographer, too!). What I appreciated most was the thought that went into the design of our itinerary. We started the day a bit early, and it was worth it. By the time we had finished our hike to the waterfall we saw the hoards of tourists piling in to experience the beauty of the region, but because we had gone earlier in the day everything was quiet and just absolutely perfect, giving us what felt like a truly unique and personalised experience. Chakib informed us that other tour companies start later in the day, which means one's experience isn't as great. The lunch with the Berber family was absolutely delicious, and the views as we ate were spectacular! I was hoping for more interaction with the family, who did their own thing while we ate (maybe there was a language barrier?). We would've liked more of an in-depth explanation of how the tajine was prepared and more about their culture. Chakib did a good job of talking to us about their lifestyle, so that was good! Overall, the Three Valleys Tour with Morocco Attractive Tours was perfect, and I wish I had done more excursions with them! I'll be sure to book with them next time, and I encourage everyone going to Morocco to do the same."

We went to one waterfall and had a fun but tough walk to the top, clambering over rocks! Then in the third valley we stopped at a local house where we had a beautiful tagine. We were slightly worried we might feel a bit uncomfortable, like the family was \"on show\" like some awkward exhibit but it felt nothing like that. Infact our tour guide told us how they got to know the family as friends and how the money for the food went directly to the family (it was handed to them at the time, via the tour guide). The views were all beautiful and it felt so peaceful and relaxing, a perfect escape from the bustle of the Medina."

It was so nice to get away from the hustle and bustle of the Marrakesh.

If you are staying in the medina they come and pick you up at a point close to your hotel (eg the central square). The guide was lovely and very knowledgable. You also stop for lunch at a small house (it costs 120d extra) and it was amazing. The view is simply stunning and the food is great and there is lots of it (you can skip dinner :) ). I loved the bread and the cinnamon orange for dessert was so good. I'm definitely going to try making this when I get home. The tagine was really good having been cooked properly over coals.

Fantastic tour in a 4 x 4 car (with only 4 people!) that fits in a variety of highlights from the Atlas Mountains, from visiting a Berber Village, a stunning waterfall and Takerkoust Lake while you travel through the mountain valleys and breathtaking scenery. We stopped for lunch in a local Berber house and ate on a terrace overlooking the mountains - one of the nicest meals we had in tour trip (for meat-lovers and vegetarians)!!Our guide Mustafa was really informative and great fun. He allowed us to stop numerous times along the way to take photos and see the local wildlife. The tour company seems to have a very good relationship with locals in the Berber villages, something which is hugely important to me!"

The lunch in the Berber village was a great (and very tasty!) experience, we couldn't have asked for more. We REALLY appreciated that Sara contacted us prior to our trip and offered to re-schedule it, as the weather forecast looked very bad on the day we've actually booked. It was truly a great experience and the highlight of our stay in Marrakesh. Definitely going with them for a desert trip next time I'm in Morocco!"

I was travelling with my daughter and our first two days in Morocco were not very impressive, since we were constantly haggled and felt very cheated. Although we hired a guide in the Medina we still did not know any history which would have connected us to the soul of the Moroccan people. We did the High Atlas Mountain and 3 valleys tour the day before we left and we were fully satisfied. Abdoul was so knowledgeable, kind and patient. He answered all my questions about the Medina, Riad, explained the history of the city, the people, schools and so much more. The Atlas mountains is a must see for everyone visiting Morocco. We had lunch in a Berber home and it was the most delicious food that we had eaten on our visit. We were graciously served and ate in the open air with an amazing view. My daughter is a camera buff and Abdoul was very patient and accommodating, we never felt rushed. Abdoul was simply amazing and the tour was the perfect ending of our trip."

I booked Morocco Attractive Tours because they were one of the few who did and I'm so glad I found them! Chakib, our guide, was excellent - both in terms of driving and in telling us about the history of the place. The lunch they organised at a Berber home was the best meal I had in Morocco all week and hands down the best setting as well! A terrific experience and I'd definitely recommend this as an option to see the gorgeous Atlas Mountains in a day. But FYI, wear proper hiking boots, the trek to the waterfall is pretty tricky to navigate!"

We were picked up at 8am which meant we got to the first valley and walk to the waterfall before other groups got there. The trip is for up to 7 people but we were lucky in that we were the only ones on the trip so had a personal tour guide, Chikab, for the day. Our first port of call was to see how Argan oil is produced and was interesting. Next, we walked to the waterfalls in Ourika Valley was fantastic but you do need good footwear such as trainers as there are some steep climbs over rocks and a jump over the river which made it even more enjoyable for us. We were brought back down a different route. In total the walk was about an hour long. We were given time to have a drink by the riverside after our walk which was very welcome.We moved out to the Oukaimeden Valley where we had lunch in a Berber village family house with a fantastic view over the valley. The house is off the normal tourist route and the there were no signs of others except locals getting on with their normal day. It was interesting to learn how the Berber houses are constructed. Whilst driving along the valley we stopped to take photos several times, especially of the snow topped Mount Toubkal, the second highest mountain on the African continent after Kilimanjaro at 4,167mWe did not stop in the third valley, the Asni Valley, except to take photos but Chikab told us that it was an apple growing area.The contrasts between the three valleys was very interesting and Chikab kept us informed about things to look out for as we drove along.We added the trip to the Kik Plateau and the Takerkoust Lake which were interesting but, again, we only stopped to take photos.It was a really good trip out of Marrakech and was probably the highlight of our holiday."

My friend and I happened to book our day tours for the only days during our stay in Marrakech when it was cold and rainy. Our first tour was originally supposed to be Ourazazate and Ait Ben Haddou and our second tour (two days later) was supposed to be a hike in the Atlas Mountains (with another tour company). On the day of our first tour, Abdul came to pick us up, on time, and we were on our way. On the way we were unable to pass because of dangerous weather conditions (snow on the mountains). Abdul seamlessly and graciously changed the tour to the Three Valley tour and worked with the other tour company to ensure that we were able to visit Ourazazate and Ait Ben Haddou on the next tour instead. To put the cherry on top, he was our tour guide again! We were especially thrilled because he is professional, VERY knowledgeable, and genuinely interested in learning about other cultures as well. Our long rides were always relaxing, safe, and entertaining. We had such a great time we plan to come back to Morocco and try out a few more of the tours with Abdoul (I'm not exaggerating). I would recommend this company 100% and Abdoul 1000%!!"

Most guides see this as a day-to-day job and you can tell how bored they are. While this was easily a trip he's done over 200 times, Abdoul was energetic and not the slightest rude during our trip to the Atlas Mountains. I asked WAY too many questions, but he kindly answered them all with lots of knowledge. He grew up in the mountain area and he knew many of the locals and customs, and was happy to introduce them to us. And by-far the best experience in Morocco was the scenic meal we ate in the rural town. Truly, don't miss your chance to visit these mountain with the best tour guide!"

Booked two excursions with Morocco Attractive Tours before I left the UK as I wanted to see as much of Morocco as I could during my 5 day visit. Was called by Abdul the day before my first tour to confirm collection time outside my hotel to go see Ouarzazate and Ait Ben Heddou. Abdul was true to his word and was waiting outside the hotel first thing in the morning for the start of the adventure. We soon discovered that the police had closed the road to Ouarzazate, after discussions with Abdul we decided to see the 3 Valleys instead (which I was due to see 2 days later). Turns out that Abdul was born in the area and I lost track of the amount of local people that waved at us as we drove by! He was extremely knowledgeable and answered every question that we threw at him which made the trip even more enjoyable. Do not hesitate to book the trip to the 3 Valleys, beautiful scenery, fantastic hike up to waterfall (take shoes with good grip and a jumper), delicious lunch at a Berber house with more food than you can eat!Abdul was able to re-arrange the cancelled trip to Ouarzazate two days later and luckily the road over the mountains had reopened. This trip is even better for seeing more of the amazing scenery and mountain vistas. Would recommend this tour if you love film and want to see where Gladiator and Game of Thrones was filmed. The film studio tour itself was a little cheesy with props from films you have never heard of or seen! We were then recommended a roof top restaurant with fantastic food and views across the town and mountains. The owner took great delight in showing us a sign photo from Sir Ben Kingsley as he ate their whilst filming. Ait Ben Heddou was the highlight of the trip (just watch out of the guy trying to charge you 10 dirhams!), it is a world heritage site so complete free to roam around and take photos. Even though it was a long journey from Marrakech there is so much to see along the way the day flew by. I am planning to go back to Marrakech and will be booking another tour and requesting my new Facebook friend Abdul as my guide."

On the day of the scheduled trip (which was on a Tuesday), the roads were closed due to snow. Our driver, Abdul, made the decision to take us on a trip to the Three Valleys instead. My friend and I had initially booked a trip to the first valley as part of a tour with another company two days later (on Thursday). We decide, however, that seeing the Three Valleys would be a great experience, given that we would be seeing much more than we would on our other tour. We were not disappointed. The trip to the Three Valleys was wonderful, and so was our guide, Abdul. He was incredibly knowledgeable about the area, and told us a lot about the culture, history, and geography of the area we were travelling through. He took us to hike the waterfall in Ourika, and then to eat at a Berber household in the mountains - the food was great, of course!After lunch, we were informed by the driver that Morocco Attractive Tours had contacted the tour company that we were scheduled to go to the first valley with two days later. Apparently, Morocco Attractive Tours informed the other tour company that we had already gone to the Three Valleys, and that we still wished to see Ouarzazate and Ait Ben Heddou. Abdul told us that the tour companies had decided that we could go to Ouarzazate and Ait Ben Heddou on Thursday and that he would be guiding us through that tour! Needless to say we were incredibly excited to have Abdul take us around again.As a side note, on Wednesday, we went to Essouira with another tour company, and the tour guide was not nearly as knowledgeable about the area as Abdul was. For example, when we met up with Abdul again on Thursday, we told him about our trip, and he mentioned areas that we should have stopped off at along the way, that we never stopped off at with the other tour company.Thursday's journey to Ouarzazate and Ait Ben Heddou was, again, very informative. Abdul was well-versed in the history, culture and geography of the location. He was a joy to be around, and recommended a restaurant that wasn't a tourist trap. Food was excellent. Abdul speaks several languages, including Berber, Arabic, English, French, and I believe he also knows some Spanish, and can understand a few more. If you travel to Morocco, I would highly recommend this tour company, but more than that, I would highly recommend that you request Abdul as a driver. You will not be sorry. You will come away with a much greater knowledge of Moroccan history and culture with him as your guide."

His passion for Morocco and the depth and breadth of his knowledge made for such an exciting and educational day. I had no idea that Morocco was so gorgeous - cliffs the colour of the canyons in Utah and mountain peaks covered in snow year round and terraced gardens and irrigation and gorgeous villages tucked into hills and the mountain valleys. We had a grand hike up to a waterfall and later enjoyed a lovely lunch at the home of a Berber family. I look forward to taking more tours with Morocco Attractive Tours.

We booked two excursions with the company, first trip was to the Three Valleys and the other was to Quarzazate & Ait Benhaddou. I can assure you both day trips were equally amazing. The company kept us update with meeting times via email. The tours were excellent and informative and this was especially credited to our tour guide Moustafa who made it one of the most memorable and best tours I have ever been on. Moustafa was professional, personable and polite but most of all extremley funny, his sense of humour was catching and he had everyone laughing throughout the day. The tour group was small with two other couples attending the tour which gave it a much more intimate experience. The trip to the Three Valleys was majestic with stunning views and captivating scenery with a visit to the Ourika waterfalls. The waterfall was amazing and the trek up there will be worth it. We then went to visit a village and watched some local women in the preparation of extracting the argon oil. We then went on to visit and enjoy the hospitality of a traditional Berber family who welcomed us into their home and whom cooked us a tasty, flavoursome and filling meal which was then followed by a refreshing cup of mint tea. It was really nice of the two lady's who cooked the food, to take the time and effort to give us a real taste of authentic home cooking. The views from the terrances were breathtaking with sections of impressive mountain layers, like most of the day another opportunity for a great photo shot. Afterwards we headed towards the Asni Valleys, high in the Atlas Mountains to soak up more of the beautiful Moroccan countryside and onwards to see the vivid sapphire blue Takerkoust Lake. The trip lasted about 9 hours, the time just flew by thanks to our guide Moustafa, who's enthusiasm, knowledge of the culture and fascinating stories kept us engaged all day. I would like to thankyou for showing us all the beauty of Morocco and Marrakech which was absolutely amazing, but the real hidden gem was meeting Moustafa the nicest person you could ever wish to meet, he has a real warmth and kindness about him and not forgetting his fantastic sense of humour. It has been an absolute pleasure getting to meet you and have you has our tour guide. I would like to say a big thankyou from Tash and Tracey. If you want a great day to remember for the rest of your life then I would fully recommend this tour."

Walked up to see the first waterfall in the Ourika Valley, stopped to have drinks along the river in those unique chair and couches set up in and beside the river. While other tours would have ended here, we continued on to see authentic Berber villages and eat a wonderful meal in a family home. We saw beautiful mountains and vistas that very few tourists see, and we were fortunate to have great people with us. We laughed and had an amazing time the whole day. Abdoul our driver/guide was fantastic. Heartily recommend this trip!!"

He showed us round the olive trees, market, a Berber house and also took us to the best viewpoints for photographing the falls. We then went down and had a boat ride around the bottom of the falls which was amazing. After all of this he took us to some of the souvenir shops and then a cafe where I had a traditional Berber omelette - very tasty! Abdul turned up to take us back to our hotel and was again very helpful and let us chill out on the journey back and just relax and snooze :)Would definitely recommend them!!"

This tour was one of the best we have ever done. We started out with a tour of the Orika Valley which is a very popular day trip from Marrakech, but then drove to see two other valleys rather than return to the city. These two other valleys felt very off the beaten track. We did not see any other tours for the entire afternoon and got to see some incredible views. The tour included a lunch that looked out on one of the biggest views I have every seen. The lunch was served by a Berber family and we were their only customers that day. Our guide was Mustafa who like others have written was full of fun stories, bad jokes, and enthusiasm for the entire trip. He told us so much about the culture of the Atlas Mountains and Morocco, and so much more. If you're looking to do a tour that is a bit different from the normal Atlas Mountains tour, this is the one to do."

The tour itself was exceptional, such a wonderful mountain range and lots of beautiful places to stop and take photos. We had a brilliant time and whilst we are tired, we have created some great memories. The highlight was having a traditional Moroccan meal high in the mountains cooked by two Berber's. Whilst the scenery and food would have been possible with other tour companies our tour guide, Moustafa would not. What made this experience exceptional for us was the incredible energy, warmth, spontaneity, care and humour Moustafa brought to his role. He was an absolute pleasure to spend almost 10 hours with and ensured the five of us all laughed and got to know each other (often the difficult part of shared tours). He was knowledgeable and friendly in equal measure. Moustafa really does seem to take pride in his work and it is wonderful to see.\u00a0Simon"

Our guide, Mustafa, was knowledgeable, helpful and interesting, and the scenery was often breathtaking. If you're interested in Berber culture and its relationship to modern Moroccan culture, I recommend checking out this tour. The Berber meal was very good as well, although they served far more food than we could eat, and the price/quantity was non-negotiable (we thought we had opted out of the lunch, but that was not an option, and the only menu preference we could indicate was whether vegetarian, so not liking olives, for instance, was not taken into account...). Finally, I know it's unavoidable on tours like these, but the company clearly has deals with various people on the way, and we felt pushed to buy various products. All in all, though, this was a worthwhile way to get out of the city and see another side of Morocco."

We had an extra day in Marrakesh holiday hence choose this 1 day 3 valleys & lake tour with a high expectation of exciting sceneries and experience. But the whole trip gave an average feel for that day. We visited a waterfall which was a low drop one and more of a waste of our energy to climb the rocky pathway to see. We had good help from the mountain guide for a safe climb. The vehicle driver/guide was average in his guide role and most of the time we couldn't hear him as we were sitting in the 2nd row of the back seat of the 4x4 vehicle. I hope the company will take this point and install mic / speaker system for future tours as the drive/guide need to look forward to concentrate on driving rather than turn towards you at the back to speak. The only good highlight was to see the Berber community living and have a good lunch at a family house. Conclusion, we didn't feel that it was a great day out tour."

Along the way, we stopped for photos with goats grazing atop the argan trees (a sight to be seen)! We also visited a women's argan oil cooperative where they demonstrated how they produce the oil, and we had an opportunity to purchase authentic argan oil products as well. Abdoul provided us with a great deal of knowledge about the history of Morocco, so this further enhanced our tour. Upon arriving at Essaouira, we had some time to sightsee, visit the local souks, eat a seaside lunch and spend some time at the beach. A highlight was a camel ride on the beach, which is an optional part of the tour, but well worth the 100 Dhm ($10 USD)! Returned to Marrakech by 6:30/7pm in time to catch more activity and dinner in the Jamaa el Fna area. We highly recommend Abdoul, as he was an impressive and excellent guide!"

When we arrived at the valley, we were greeted by a nice local guide who was also super kind and gave us an incredible two hour climbing tour to see the waterfalls.The lunch is a bit expensive but probably worth the price for what we got. Abdul also helps us with personal request which is highly appreciated.The only thing I think that can be improved is that the shop we were taken to is overpriced, pretty but overpriced. We didn't buy any souvenirs even though we wanted to."

He explained the culture and history wonderfully, he asnwered all of our questions, and he looked out for us and made sure we always new what was going on. Both tours were great, though we enjoyed the Ouarzazate tour most. The views of the Atlas mountains are wonderful, the casbahs are fun to explore, and the Ait Ben Haddou region is beautiful. This tour is definitely more kid-friendly and you don't hassled as much to buy things. The 3 Valleys tour is fun as well. You definitely get a more intimate look at the Berber culture and villages. The hike to the waterfall is an interesting. The mountain views are great. The lunch at a Berber home is the highlight of the trip for sure (aside from Mostafa's company)!"

Our guide Mostafa was very friendly and impressed with his local knowledge and humour! The lunch in a local Berber house was delicious and an insight into how the locals live. Take walking boots for the scramble up to the falls and as it can get chilly on the sunless climb a sweater or coat is advised. Probably best to avoid the optional lake tour as it's a man-made reservoir and not of much interest."

Very polite and always full of jokes. The Valley had many beautiful scenaries and we had plenty of time to take pictures and enjoy the view. It was the most relaxing tour I've ever been on. Never felt rushed at all which added more to the experience. This is a must book tour if you're spending time in Marrakesh! If you can get Mostafa, it is a huge bonus with your trip. "

            "review": "3 Valleys: Excellent Escape. The 3 Valleys group tour was excellent. Why?Group size - there were only five of us and I was travelling solo, but I never felt alone. Comfort - the vehicle was very clean and comfortable, which was great because the tour covers a great distance. The photo stops - an opportunity to take in the breath-taking scenery whilst giving your legs a little stretch. Our guide was patient, helpful and full of information. Timing - getting to the waterfall early was brilliant as it meant we avoided the crowds that arrived as we were leaving. The highlight - lunch in a Berber village. Lowlight - seeing the impact of climate change. Very little snow on the mountains at the end of December. It's quite sobering. Top tips: Wear shoes suitable for hiking. The waterfall is a bit of a climb, on sometimes slippery rocks. My trainers had insufficient grip. Wear a backpack and not a handbag or messenger bag. Again, a better choice for navigating the climb. Wear clothing that can be layered, esp in Winter. A (long-sleeved) t-shirt/top, a light sweater, a jacket and a scarf will ensure that you can respond to the differences in a) your body temperature (the hike will make you warm) and b) the variable climate. All in all a brilliant tour on my three-night Christmas break. Thank you."

We departed from the city at about 8 in the morning, which avoided most of the other tourists in the first valley.The guide was great, spoke excellent English and was happy to tell us about Moroccan culture in general. The walk to the first waterfall was worth it, even though the waterfall itself isn't really that interesting. There are other tours that will take you to all the other falls.Lunch at the berber house was a really nice experience and not as touristic as we first thought. All over this tour is a great experience if you wanna get out of Marrakech for a day."

Unlike many of the tours that just visit one Valley this one allows you to see how the landscape is very different across the mountain area. The pickup was on time, vehicle comfortable and our guide was awesome, the early start meant we had first dibs getting to the waterfall (it gets extremely busy later in the day). Our guide was always ready to answer any questions we had and was clearly well known with the local kids who were all very happy to see him.Our lunch inside a berber house overlooking the entire valley was a nice touch and the food delicious. My partner and i felt that this trip was not only informative and fun but ethical too with the local stops acting as support to the local people rather than just a tourist trap.We recommend this trip if you want a relaxed and informative day out. You're never pressured and you really get a feel for what the mountain life is like. Thanks for a great day!"

As we arrived we had free time to do things on our own - see the harbor, the market and chill at the beach. We drove back at 4 p.m., but it's your choice when you want to go back. You can take your time. When we drove back, our guide told us lots of things about Morocco again. It was a really great tour and Essaouira is a wonderful city!On our second tour was the three valleys and lake tour. Our guide was also great, spoke english fluent and told us many things. Everything has been perfekt. Great places, great views, great people. We had lunch in a wonderful berber village with a stunning view over the valley. I really have to say, that the trip to the waterfall can't be called hiking - I think it was climbing! It was a nice experience, but for people like me (unathletic) a really hard job. But it was worth it!All in all I have to say, that tours made by Morocco Attractive Tours are professional and really nice!"

Was picked up from the hotel early by our tour guide for the day 'Abdoul'. The mountains aren't that far from the centre really so the journey starts pretty quickly. There is so much to see that you had no idea existed so close to the driest desert! Abdoul would stop off (and always a gentleman opened the doors for us) to allow us good photo moments and would also take them for us, plus gave us information about the places. Remember to bring some good sturdy walking shoes as one of the stop offs is going with another tour guide (forgotten the name) who too us up the mountains to see some beautiful waterfalls. the higher we went the more amazing they are! You wont be going up the top of the mountain as that's a different tour. But where he took us was brilliant. He was very helpful, as quite alot of the walking included slippery boulders to climb! It's quite a brisk walk so not for those who lose breath easily. Lunch is provided at an extra cost (150d p/p). Mention at the start of the tour if a veggie as the lunch is in a Burbur house and they will need to prepare. The food was the best of the week and once again so much food was provided. Felt very bad for leaving some. It also gets a bit chilly, but the spectacular views make up for it. The ride back went through more villages and past Richard Branstons hotel in the middle of nowhere to another beautiful view of a lake. Adboul was very patient with us, as a young group of 6, we did take our time so the trip ran a bit late, but he wasn't pushy with us, just let us take our time. Would defiantly recommend this trip to all. Along day but if in Marrakesh for short time please squeeze this trip in."

Beautiful products. Then we did a fair amount for walking in the sunshine to the waterfalls, which involved climbing up a few rocks but was well worth it.

The climb and the experience of venturing into the countryside of the Atlas mountains was one I will never forget. After returning back to the car we drove into the Oukaimeden valley where we went higher and higher until we arrived at a berber village where we were welcomed into a villager's house for traditional lunch of tagine and couscous.

He was punctual and delivered all that was promised. His suggestion for a restaurant for lunch was excellent. Great seafood. The fishing port was like going back in time a hundred years. We were there in October so the smell wasn't too bad. My guess is that in July or August the port would smell quite \"ripe\".One of the strangest things we have ever seen was on the way there. This is the only place in the entire world where Argan trees grow. There are goat herds in the area and they actually climb the trees to eat the nuts. They eat the husk and spit out the nut. Wouldn't believe it if I hadn't seen it myself. Google \"goat tree\" and you'll see. Pretty funny."

The trip was not only a visit to the three valleys but also a cultural experience because we have learnt during this day a lot about the traditions of the moroccan people. This was mainly due to Abdoul, talking to him felt like talking to an old friend and he was very informative. We asked him a lot of questions about all the things that crossed our minds and he was very kind all the time and provided us a lot of details, even showed us photos with traditional weddings. The trip was very well planned: he picked-up us from our hotel at exactly 8 o'clock as it was agreed and after Abdoul presented us what we will see during the day just to give us a flavour about how things will develop. We reached the mountains and after telling him that we would want a camel ride he stopped in an amazing place for a 15 minute ride-enough to enjoy the experience i would say. After, we went for a trip in the mountains to the waterfall Fatima-very nice road and experience. the climb might be wet so be sure to take some proper shoes. Other highlight of the trip was the meal in a berber village! We ate traditional food (really traditional not what they sell in the medina under this name) in an amazing berber house from where you could see the whole valley. We stayed here enough to rest but also to enjoy the time with Abdoul when we found out a lot of things about the morocan lifestyle. We stopped in amazing places and during the trip Abdoul was very helpful and gave us a lot of advices about topics we were interested in.I know there are many companies with great ratings in tripadvisor but i can really say that this trip is something that i will remember always and we kept saying for hours after coming back in the hotel room what fabulous was the whole day."

After a couple of days poolside at our Medina based hotel, we were looking forward to a day further a field and the day didn't disappoint, In fact it has absolutely made our trip to Morocco. It would be a missed opportunity of the worst order to not take the opprotunity to get out of the city anf experience the amazing countyside of the the Atlas Mountains. Much of the credit for our memorable experience goes to our amazing driver and guide Abdoulaz who made us feel more like privlieged guests than tourists. Articulate, knowledgeable and passionate about his country and community, it was Abdoulaz who made our trip. The trek up to the waterfall was led by a local nimble footed guide (Kamil?) and lunch at the berber village was a highlight as we were driven through the Moroccan countryside with a different view and landscape at ever turn. Well worth the trip, you don't now what you are missing and if you're really lucky, you'll get Abdoulaz !"

We went on a sunset camel ride which was fantastic. I was concerned the camels would be poorly treated but they seemed very healthy and well cared for and were super cute, especially the two babies who walked beside the adult camels. Our two guides were great fun and very informative, happily answering all our questions along the way. Every camel had a name and were happy to let us pet them. The second tour we did was to the Atlas Mountains which was our favorite day of the holiday. A full packed 8hours with Abdul, our very knowledgable and friendly tour guide. We visited the Argon oil atelier and trekked for an hour to the waterfall (we were in converse and saw one man in flip flops so not too extreme!) we were offered lunch at a local resto but chose to eat with a traditional Berber family in the mountains. Abdul promised it would be the best meal we have all holiday and he wasn't wrong! One tip, don't fill up on the scrummy starter, this was a 4 course meal! All for an extra 150d pp. Both tours were great value and so much fun! Must dos on both parts!"

The camel sunset tour was a great little trip out of the city and the guide was good too (sharp sense of humour). We also went on the 3 valleys trip which had some amazing scenery. If you're going to do this one then try not to dawdle as there is a lot to fit in to the day. Likelihood is if you're a big group then you will naturally go slower so I wouldn't bother adding the lake.Great company to go with though, very knowledgable guides and highly recommended!"

What a professional company - email's answered quickly, follow up about pick up times when I was in Marrakech, on time collection, nice clean vehicle to travel in - would recommend anyone book with confidence with this company.My friend and I spent an amazing day in the Atlas Mountains with Chakib, our driver and guide. Careful behind the wheel, amazing knowledge about places and their history as we drove along, stopping at great vantage points to take photos as we went. Included in our tour was a stop at a local co-operative to watch how argan oil is produced, well worth buying products as they are genuine.We then headed onto see the waterfalls, probably not the best and most exciting but the climb up to them was just great! Abdul, who was our guide, was friendly and very caring about all of us on the climb, helping each one of us to master some of the more steep slopes! The climb is not an easy one so wear good solid shoes and if you have any health or mobility problems, think twice before attempting it.One of the highlights was lunch with a Berber family - the food was absolutely delicious and their hospitality allowing us into their own home and being able to take photos was lovely.Having travelled fairly extensively around the world and taken various tours, I can honest say this is one of the better ones I have been on - the Company and their personnel are outstanding."

The climbing to the waterfall is not easy. I would not recommend the climbing for people with leg problems. The lunch up in the mountains was delicious and very well presented. It was made from natural ingredients. Loved the organic apple! My husband and I really enjoyed every bit of it. A big thanks to mr Abdul and mr Omar. Hope to see you again!!! Mr and Mrs Khan."

They were easy to contact by email and Sara fully responded to any questions I had about the trips. In the end I booked the Three Valleys day excursion as I was travelling with my mother who cannot walk very far, and that was the one they recommended for us. The guide Chakib, picked us up in the morning at 8:30am, not far from our hotel as we were staying in the medina, and it's difficult to get cars through the narrow alleyways. We were in a group of 7 people, and Chakib very expertly drove us to and around the mountains. We went to Ourika valley first where we had the chance to see some Berber women making Argan oil, and then onto the waterfalls. For this you need sturdy walking/hiking shoes, however since my Mum couldn't make the walk up to the waterfalls, we waited at a nearby cafe. Then onto the next village for lunch with a Berber family, which was excellent, a 3-course meal for only 150 MAD. The drive up to this valley was pretty hairy at times! I unfortunately, do not have a head for heights and was sitting in the front passenger seat, so had to quietly gulp and close my eyes! After the long relaxing lunch, we went to the final valley of Asni, where we stopped to take photos but not much else. Altogether it was a great day out to the mountains, with beautiful, stunning scenery. Our guide Chakib, was incredibly friendly and pleasant with a lot of knowledge about the mountains and Berber way of life. Most importantly, he was a safe and expert driver, getting us all back safely to our hotels. Would definitely recommend."

Knowledgeable and enthusiastic, he clearly enjoys his job and coming from one of the villages we passed through on the trip, he knew the area in detail. We also appreciated his careful driving especially on the mountain roads.The scenery is distinctly different from one valley to the next, which we didn't expect. It was interesting to see the area where the locals go to escape the hustle and bustle of the city and the Berber meal was very tasty. Highly recommend this trip and hopefully you will get Abdellah as your guide."

Here are a few of the more noteworthy issues or things that my friend and I feel a bit mislead on:- the drive out was 4.5 hours and back was 3.5-3.75 nowhere near the 3 hour mark listed on Viator's site where I booked the trip.- we never even had the chance to go see the film museums. The driver simply pointed at the studios and drove past. This was disappointing to say the least. - the Berber museum was closed for Ramadan, which we understand but should have been communicated to us with an option to decline the trip. Our driver didn't understand our surprise it was closed. - in Ouarzazate we drove next to one castle and then went to a 'museum' where the merchant spoke for a few minutes about Berber culture and then hounded us to buy rugs and other items. Not a museum by any standard. Our driver was nowhere to be found until he was done with his nap (understandable during Ramadan but gave us no option to leave this 'museum' early).- our driver was late. Not by a whole lot but still not a great impression. He drove quite fast (still the ride was longer than stated) but barely said a word the entire trip. - the UNESCO site was nice but our driver basically said it was old and a UNESCO site. Pretty obvious to anyone looking at it.- when I contacted the tour company to inquire about a refund they were responsive, offered a camel ride in 105 degree weather (wasn't possible for our itinerary), and said our driver was one of their best. No offer of a refund, totally lacking in sincerity. I've been to over 50 countries and this was easily the worst experience I've had concerning a contracted tour."

A really hot day 44 C in Marrakech, but cooler once we had some altitude. The walk to the Ourika falls (with a separate guide) was not easy - and occasionally challenging for those of us into our 60's - and good walking/trekking footwear should be advised in advance. The climb into the higher Atlas mountains was visually spectacular - but only people with a good head for heights should sit on the valley side of the car. The setting for the Berber lunch was breathtaking."

He knew many of the local people and arranged for a guide (Kamal) to escort us up to the Ourika waterfalls. Kamal was a great help especially as we got closer to the top of the trail which was quite steep. It was not a difficult hike but certainly got you breathing a little heavier as we neared the top. The scenery was well worth it and we were very happy to have done this early in the morning as opposed to later in the day when it was hotter. We noted many people chose not to use a guide but we were very keen to support the local people involved in tourism as a thank you for letting us share their wonderful environment . Many of the tours only do one valley but the addition of two more and the lake is well worth it if you have time. We really enjoyed the lunch in one of the villagers homes which was so tasty and was all local organic produce - a welcome introduction to Morrocan food. The scenery is stunning and so different from what we have seen elsewhere. Thank you Abdul and Kamal for making this trip one of the highlights of our three month travels through many countries."

Once in Morocco, we wanted to change the time of our trip and again they were extremely nice to adjust it. We have been picked up from the Riad in a nice air conditioned car and took to the Palm Grove where the camel ride happens.A local boy took over from there and led the camels through the Palm grove. It was an amazing experience. He was extremely nice and stopped multiple times to take photos. Everyone spoke good English and it was easy for us to talk to them.It was the best experience in Morocco and I would highly recommend them"

Our guide Abdul was friendly, helpful, and a good driver who answered all of our questions and gave us good and interesting information about the areas we were visiting. We were able to gain an appreciation of village life in the foothills of the Altas mountains, appreciate the beauty of the mountains themselves, swim under a waterfall in the mountains, have lunch at the house of a rural villager (scrumptious and an unbeatable view!), meet rural villagers, ride a camel, have tea at various points throughout the day, and so forth. This was a nice change from the hustle and bustle of Marrakech, and allowed us to gain an appreciation of rural Morocco, the Atlas mountains, and those who live there. Abdul was from one of the villages we visited, and it was extremely interesting to hear him talk about his hometown and way of life. I highly recommend this tour service and be sure to ask for Abdul as a guide."

A friend and I went on the Atlas Mountains \"Three Valleys and a Lake\" tour run by Morocco Attractive Tours and it was by far the highlight of our trip. Our tour guide Abdul spoke English very well and was an expert on the Atlas Mountains (he mentioned that he grew up in a village there). Abdul drove us all around the mountains in a reliable Toyota truck. The day was filled with incredible views, hikes near waterfalls, camel riding, tea at various scenic locations, and a lunch with food that was as authentically Moroccan as it gets and a view that took your breath away. I would highly recommend this tour to anyone going to Morocco as you will get to experience both an amazing natural environment while observing the safe and welcoming villages of the Atlas Mountains. Along with the tour, our guide, Abdul really was top notch and is worth requesting. Cheers!"

I booked this for myself and my two fellow travellers before we left home, but I wasn't really sure what to expect because I could only find a few reviews. Well! What an experience! All went exactly as planned. We were collected exactly on time by our driver / guide in an SUV and then driven to the Palmerie on the outskirts of the city for our hour-long camel trek. The guide had great English and provided a running commentary about the areas we passed through as we drove. When we arrived we saw the camels and their handlers. We were kitted up in headscarves and tunics and shown our camels. There were lots of opportunities for photos before, during, and after the ride. Our camel leader who had no English but did speak French offered to take our cameras and took loads of photos during the trek. He even took some video on one of our cameras that we didnt see until the next day! One of the camels Shakira had a baby who was three months old who walked alongside her for the trek. It was very cute! In fact all the camels were lovely.Halfway through the trek we stopped at a traditional Berber house for tea and a small pastry served by the lady of the house. It was lovely, but the house was hot! Then we remounted for the rest of the trek. As he walked, our guide picked long grasses which he made into camel shapes amazingly skilled! and he gave each of us one as a souvenir. He was very sweet and clearly loved the animals. We were then collected by our driver who stopped on the road home so we could take photographs of the beautiful sunset. We were all stiff and sore the next day because camel saddles are not soft, but it was so worth it! I highly recommend the trip. Indeed, I would say its a 'must-do' if you go to Marrakech!"

The absolute highlight of the three valleys trip is the meal in a Berber house. The house is at the top of a valley with stunning views and the food is absolutely delicious. As for Essauoira, my highlight was the fishing port where a catch was being landed. My partner liked the souk which was less frenetic than Marrakech. One recommendation here is to go further into town before you settle for snacks and much needed drink. The square near the harbour is fine enough but some of the more hidden places looked nice too."

Highlights included a very tasty and authentic lunch in a Berber village high in the mountains, where the views were so peaceful, and clambering up to visit waterfalls which was great, but make sure you take appropriate footwear. It was a circular tour thus letting us enjoy varied scenery and see different parts of Marrakech.We had a very comfortable new Mercedes 7 seater car and again Shakib was knowledgeable, that he had an answer for everything. We also had a stop in the berber run Argan shop were the ladies were working hard making Argan oil which I purchased for the wife back home, the ladies also made fresh bread and served it with local Honey and Argan oil which was really nice and complimentary. 2 Tips Buy some Honey it is of top quality and if you need to use the toilets go here as it's really clean. I will definitely visit Marrakech again and the two things on my list to do will be to book this tour again and secondly to ask and insist on having Shakib as a guide."

We made the original booking for the trip to the Ourika Valley, Kik Plateau and Lake Takeroust via Viator, and a lovely gentleman called Abdul came to pick us up in a 4 x 4. Abdul, our driver and guide was a friendly and knowledgeable chap, who hailed from Ourika Valley itself, so it was absolutely fantastic. He told us all about the atlas mountains, the ways the Berbers live in the mountains, the climates, fauna and landscape, everything else you needed to know. The drive through the Atlas mountains was simply breathtaking. The scenery and landscape was outstanding. We encountered hail, snow, sleet, rain, wind, sun, absolutely everything on our drive. We also made stops along the way for photos.During the trip we also visited the Argan Coop. Although it was a pleasant learning experience, we didn't buy anything as we found it expensive (genuine Argan is quite pricey according to Abdul). Our visit to the Setti Fatima waterfalls, was quite something. To our surprise, we found ourselves actually rock climbing vertical cliffs (jumping over waterfalls, crossing broken rickety bridges, wet rocks, and sometimes going on all fours) with our guide who promised to keep us safe. Several visitors did not have appropriate footwear or clothing, and the trek was a bit dangerous. I wouldn't recommend the trek to Setti Fatima waterfalls for young children or the elderly, or those who lack a certain level of fitness. The lunch at the Berber village was amazing and delicious. Unfortunately it turned a bit cloudy as we drove across the Kik Plateau so our views of the Lake weren't as impressive. But the trip wasn't a disappointment, far from it. I highly recommend this tour.."

Our tour guide Abdul immediately introduced himself and made us feel welcome. We drove up to the Atlas Mountains where we had regular pit stops for taking pictures. Be prepared to have your breath taken away! The scenery is stunning and the relaxing atmosphere makes a nice change from the craziness of the medina markets. If it's a bit cloudy, we'd recommend taking a light jumper or sweater as it gets a bit cold up in the mountains. We had our own tour guide take us up on the Atlas mountain, as other reviewers have said, make sure to wear sturdy walking boots or trainers. It took about an hour to climb up and down, it's definitely not for the faint hearted, think rickety wooden bridges and crossing the waterfall streams with a good metre between each stepping stone. I did fall in a few times (not extremely, wet socks were the worst I had to complain about!) but our tour guide was very experienced and I had my utmost confidence in him guiding us. The views are stunning, particularly the waterfalls, haven't experienced anything like it, it's been the highlight of our trip so far! We then drove for about an hour (which was the perfect opportunity to sleep off the exhaustion of climbing a mountain) We arrived at a traditional Berber village up in the mountains and had an amazing lunch. I don't want to give too much away, you just need to experience it for yourself!! We then drove back down and got back to the city around 6pm. Feeling exhausted, exhilarated and happy. Maybe don't plan too much for the evening as you'd be surprised by how tiring the day can be, or maybe that's just us! Wholeheartedly recommend this trip, you won't regret it!"

There were only 6 participants in addition to our guide so we each got a lot of personal attention and were so well looked after. To be noted as well is that we traveled in a very safe vehicle with an extremely cautious driver--there are many hairpin turns on the journey.The scenery is absolutely spectacular. While there are some challenging areas to climb and hike, we were given a lot of help and well advised if we should not take in a part of the strenuous hike.We learned a lot about life in Morocco outside of the big city and of the Berber culture and life style in the small mountainous villages. Also we enjoyed a fabulous authentic meal which will never be forgotten.If you have a day to spend touring outside of Marrakech, my family and I would highly recommend that you make this adventure a part of your Moroccan experience."

Many companies could learn a lot from our driver/guide's customer service skills and he was also an excellent driver. This was useful on a sometimes hair-raising trip (a number of rocks on the road after heavy rain the night before). We unfortunately had to miss out the walk to the cascades, due to the wet conditions, but got some exercise when we volunteered to help clear the road of rocks at one point. We then drove higher into the mountains and into heavy snowfall! From sun to rain to snow and then cloud/fog...certainly an eventful day weatherwise, accompanied by some stunning scenery.Lunch at the Berber village provided the best food we have had so far in Morocco and we were happy to pay the additional amount direct to the Berber cook for this service.All in all a great day out from this small, but perfectly formed, tour company."

What you get in this tour from the company is an excellent informative driver and a comfortable 4x4 on a pre planned route.The views are excellent and the mountain air is fresh (but they are free!)Abdul our guide was enthusiastic and well informed.The walk up to the waterfall is worth it but do bring a good pair of hiking shoe. A guide is not essential but beneficial.Berber village lunch is excellent- the views are stunning.The points to ponder:-it's a nature tour so I don't understand the obligatory argon oil cooperative visit!!!!-stops at stalls on the climb to the waterfall-include the additional prices to the tour -approx 25 Euro and advertise with this inclusion (it's not possible to have lunch anywhere else or decline a guide to the waterfall)-if the above additional payments are not included on the advertised tour rate then let us pay the guide (to waterfall) and the Berber women (for lunch) directly rather than pay the driver at the end. (As I am uncertain how much the guide or Berber women actually get for their service)However I would highly recommend this tour or a similar if you are in Marrakech. Don't miss the stunning views of atlas mountain valleys."

The day was long albeit interesting throughout thanks to our fantastic tour guide Mustafa who was funny and informative during our trip. The three valleys are beautiful with the landscape changing through each one with amazing views of the Atlas mountains. Mustafa was only too willing to stop when we requested to take photos at points along the way. The argan oil visit was interesting; we did not feel pressured at all to buy anything. The trip to the waterfalls was a extremely fun experience; without a doubt you need a guide as the route is very tricky and involves some level of fitness and courage. Our meal in the berber house had an incredible setting of the mountains; our group could not believe how beautiful it was. And for the price you get a lot of food!We completed our trip with a visit to plateu kiki which was a beautiful clear blue. I'm not usually one to write reviews but this was such a good tour. Even when my friend left her coat in the 4x4 the company kindly dropped it off the next day."

We had different guides in each day and they were both great, friendly and flexible with timing and arrangements. The fact that the groups are small is a big bonus.The pick-up point was very confusing. We received the name of a place we couldn't find on google maps, but thought it was fine. In our Riad, unfortunately the guy didn't know where it was and sent us to the wrong address. Eventually we managed to find it, but when you have a pick-up time of 7:30am it can be very stressful. I would recommend the company to provide a more appropriate and informative email. A hyperlink or image to a map showing the exact point would be nice. Everyone uses google maps in Marrakech, including our Riad and taxi drivers, but they couldn't help us finding the pick-up point provided by the company.Anyway, this was just a minor inconvenient which we were lucky to solve. Happy customer!"

Most valley tours cover only one valley so this tour was one of the very few. The excursion was with 4 people including us in a comfortable 4x4. At the Ourika valley we had a stop-over to hike up to see the waterfall. It cost a bit extra to have the guide take you to the top (not for the faint-hearted) but was a great experience, and well worth it.At the Oukaimeden Valley, the views were amazing, driving along the roads carved on mountains. We had a stop-over and saw how argon oil was made then, we stopped and had lunch (extra expense) in a Berber home, it really was an excellent authentic cooked lunch. While we ate we had spectacular view of the valley.We then saw the last valley (Asni Valley) which was uniquely different. Through-out the day there were plenty of stop-overs to take pictures with the camera.Our guide deserves a special mention, he was very professional and well-spoken english. He mentioned a lot of interesting facts throughout the day and it was very easy for us to ask questions. During the drive, whenever he noticed that we want to take a picture, he would stop for that moment. Before the trip day he also went out of his way to recommend us to have the tour on another day due to the forecast so the mountains were clearer to see and Oukaimeden Valley was open. The email communication was also quick.I would highly recommend this excursion with Morocco Attractive Day Tours."

Originally we had booked to go to the Ouzoud Falls Day Trip, but Chakib had taken us on the first tour and he recommended we change to the Three Valleys Tour so that we could go on a more appropriate day and experience different landscapes from our first tour. We are so glad we took his advice, as this was a spectacular day out.In the first valley, Ourika, we crossed a wooden bridge hanging above the river, and then climbed with a local guide to see the waterfall. The climb was challenging in some places, and we were very glad that we had sturdy hiking shoes and were reasonably fit. The waterfalls were pretty, the view was lovely and we enjoyed a drink at the top before making the descent. Along the walk there are several local Berber sellers with jewellry, woodcraft, rugs and ceramics. There was no real pressure to buy anything, and we enjoyed watching the Berber wood craftsman using his 'Black and Decker' original drill to make holes in stone lanterns.In the second valley - Oukaimeden, we saw a totally different landscape. Flooding of the rivers in November had destroyed some of the roads, but we felt totally safe with Chakib's careful driving. He took us off the main road to do some 4WD and take a different route to the village where we had lunch in a local Berber house. This was the best part of the day - the people were very friendly, the view from their roof terrace was absolutely spectacular, and the food was amazing. This was by far the best tagine we had in Morocco - there was plenty of food (soup, tagine, couscous and fresh oranges for dessert) and it was tasty and hot. It was great to see how the family live and to meet some of the local children.The third valley was Asivi. We chose not to have a camel ride, but enjoyed going through one of the main villages where it was market day and it was amazing to see the organised chaos of all the men in the market.I can't praise Chakib highly enough - he is a safe driver, very knowledgeable about the local area, traditions and people and very happy to share what he knows and answer questions. We had a wonderful day and will be recommending this tour to others."

The valley was beautiful, the mountain tops were covered in snow! We decided to take the trek up to the waterfall under the expert guidance of our Berber guide Kemal. On the way we decided to make a quick stop to cross one of the hand made hanging bridges and take lots of photographs of the mountains.The next valley Oukaimeden was my favourite. We drove nearly 2000m up into the mountains, and the view was simply amazing. The rainbow colours of the mountain, the little Berber villages clinging to the mountain side and the snow on the higher mountains made me feel like I was standing in the middle of a beautiful painting. We had lunch at a traditional Berber house. The house and the hammam really intrigued me. I wish I could have spent a night there, it was so peaceful. The food was delicious, traditional Tagine, Cous Cous and the most delicious oranges. The third valley Asni was beautiful too.

Fortunately for us we went ahead on the Tuesday as planned & the weather was wonderful. We were picked up right on time at our hotel & our driver was excellent. Due to the flash flooding the weekend before some of the roads were blocked or unsafe & this meant we were unable to see the waterfall - but there was still plenty to see & enjoy. The womens co-operative producing the Argan Oil was very interesting & all the women there lovely & very helpful. The driver was happy to stop as often as we wanted for photos of the scenery - the views - wow! I expected lovely views - its spectacular. Being in a car rather than on a bus meant we could go up & down 3 valleys on tiny twisting & turning roads. We had the option to have lunch at a Berber village for an extra charge This was by far the best meal of our stay in Morocco. The young woman who cooked had prepared the most delicious meal of soup, tagine (meat & veggie options available), cous cous & fruit. The setting was spectacular - a table is set on the roof terrace with amazing views over the valley and the only sounds are from the animals & the occasional passing car. We would highly recommend this trip - a great day out, beautiful scenery & amazing food. A real highlight on our trip to Marrakech. "

In order to fully visit Morocco, I did a lot of research online and came across this company, with an excellent offer of tours and inherent price, and boy, I was completely right!From Sara, during the booking, to Chakib and Youssef, the staff was impeccable. Chakib was our first acquaintance providing the airport transfer, and the first day tour in Marrakech. He is a really easy going guide and you can naturally see that he is enjoying what he is doing. By checking our tour he was proactive and also advised us to visit the desert, and at the end that was one of the highlights of our trip.Youssef was then our driver for the rest of trip, driving around 2000km around Morocco, to visit the highlights and get to know all kinds of realities and landscapes that the country can offer. Youssef was a bit more reserved person, compared to Chakib, however was also able to provide valuable information and navigating us around easily, in the chaotic Moroccan traffic. If you really want to visit the country this is the company to use! The riad/hotel selection was great, specially in Fes and Marrakech. The meal selection is something that I would improve during this tour, since the quality has differed a lot, from very good to less good.I want to leave a big thank you to Chakib, Sara and Youssef for making our stay in Morocco safe and memorable.Some tips for you travelers:- Not related to the tour but remember that the first thing you need when you arrive to Morocco is... a pen!! That's right, you need to fill a form and there is no pens available anywhere (and the airport staff will not be willing to help you). To not relay in a friendly tourist do not forget to carry one.- When you book this tour you are booking a driver and not exactly a guide. Guide's are optional and come with a price. A guide for Fes is almost mandatory to know the city, and Adib (if I remember correctly), was a perfect guide there!- I would only advise the company to make the prices more clear in the website. The shown prices are without accommodation, and additional costs like guides. My budget had a lot of flexibility but the extras may scare some people that would be willing to book with you."

Besides my husband there was only one other passenger,we picked him up in the Medina.We were driven in the 4x4 to the first Valley,this was breathtaking, the mountain tops were covered in snow! We headed up to the Waterfall, we opted to take this optional tour (extra cost) with a local guide. On the way we stopped several times for photographs and also at a Berber village to learn about the Argan Oil,of course we ended up making a purchase! The track up to see the waterfall was a great experience,there were restaurants and shops on the way, the trail was a little precarious so one needs to wear either hiking boots or shoes with good soles, I did not, I was wearing Toms! The tour then continued to the next Valley where we had lunch at a Berber house,exclusive to this tour operator. The food was delicious,hot vegetable soup, we needed it because we ate on the roof and it was cold, followed by Tagine of chicken and fruit then Cous Cous with vegetables,to finish local apples and tea. The trip back through the third valley was also spectacular, a windy road that Jawad mentioned he knew every curve and could drive it with his eyes closed,to which we exclaimed,please no!!!!He pointed out a hotel owned by Richard Branson that was by the side of the river.I can highly recommend this tour, do not go to Marrakech without experiencing it! One final note everyone we met was very friendly and the children adorable,it was a holiday so they were not in school.Do take some sweets for the children in case you should come across them."

Three totally different landscapes with so much to see from cascades of water from the snowy peaks of the mountains in the Ourika Valley, to wide open spaces of\u00a0Oukaimeden valley with a lunchtime reservation overlooking a landscape that will stay in your memory for ever. The meal, specially prepared by the Berber family was delicious and well worth the additional cost. Finally the trip ends in the green Asni Valley where each turn of the road produces another heart-stopping view. The final trip with Chakib to Ouzard Fall's (probably my favourite tour) will amaze you! 100 metre high falls that tumble into a lagoon of crystal clear waters below will mesmerise you with their outstanding beauty. Macaque monkeys watch over you as you take the winding steps to the bottom of the falls and once again we were treated to the best table in the restaurant over looking these majestic falls. The last trip to Essaouira which was led by Muhammad is \u00a0well worth the visit. The journey through wide open spaces of the country is breathtaking, and the arrival at the seaside town is clean and tidy. Again the guide suggested places to visit and eat and even gave tips on haggling for decent dinner prices! All in all I would have no hesitation of recommending all of the tours we attended. And by no means least, I would certainly recommend the drivers. Both Chakib and Muhammad were courteous, well spoken and excellent drivers. They were extremely punctual and got us back exactly on time each evening. Excellent value for money and the only real way to appreciate the wonderful scenery of Morocco! \u00a0"

Our driver Chakib was excellent, his English was fantastic and we felt safe at all times with his driving. Ait Benhaddou was well worth the visit and steeped in history. The three valleys again was fantastic and the meal with the Berber family on their terrace was breathtaking. Ouzard Falls again was breathtaking. The Essaouira day trip was a lot more relaxing but again something we really enjoyed. I would recommend all four trips. We had a fantastic time and the excursions are value for money and made our time in Morocco a experience that we will never forget."

            "review": "Fun and scenic excursion led by an entertaining guide. Recommended.. My girlfriend and I had a fantastic time on this excursion, given by our driver Chakib who was friendly, made great conversation, and was a safe driver. His English is also fantastic, which made it easy to communicate.Our day started with a prompt and easy pickup in the Jemaa el-Fnaa square. On our particular excursion we were given the following options for experiences: 1) a camel ride 2) an Argan oil shop run by a women's co-op 3) a hike to a waterfall and 4) lunch in a Berber home.On the way to our first visit, we opted to skip the camel ride. Honestly the camel experiences seemed set up like taxi line for various excursions by the side of the road and didn't look that scenic. We didn't feel like we missed much.The Argan oil shop was basically mandatory, and was incredibly touristy and basically a gift shop. We had expected as much. It comes with the territory when you book any excursion - and both having been veterans of bus tours in Asia, I have to say they were incredibly laid back when it comes to the sell. It could've been way worse. After watching a demonstration of the manufacturing process, we were given mint tea and samples of different products. We were courteous and bought an item. Overall this stop was an expected and necessary hassle of day trips and we were glad it wasn't too time-intensive.When we arrived in Ourika Valley, we took the hike. The guide for the hike was extra (I can't recall the exact amount but it wasn't too much). We opted for the guide, and were actually glad we did. While the hike might not be difficult for some, it is a steep and endless stairmaster that went on for about 30 minutes. The lower part of the hike went through gift shops filled with artisanal crafts (much like you'd see in the souks of Marrakech), but the upper part was all trail. Some parts are a little technical requiring some climbing over boulders and putting your legs through narrow spaces. We noticed a lot of Moroccans doing the hike too. At the top, there was a small pond at the base of the waterfall and plenty of people wading in to cool off, and taking selfies. It wasn't much to look at but it was a pleasant and entertaining experience. After the hike we took a break. Locals apparently love to hang out along the riverfront and IN the exposed riverbed. We grabbed some sodas to cool off after the hike down.After the waterfall hike, we drove to the Asni Valley for lunch. In fact, this was probably the longest drive in our excursion (I think it might've been a 2 hour drive), filled with gorgeous views of the mountains, occasionally interrupted with quaint little hillside adobe Berber villages. We stopped for lunch in one of the last Berber villages along the drive, near the highest point on the road. Chakib informed us their lunch at the Berber home was an exclusive arrangement with the village elder's son, and no other excursion outfitter had such an option. In fact, few even drove to these 3 valleys - which was evidenced by the fact that we didn't see another 4x4 SUV on the road or during the hour we sat for lunch outside. Lunch was superb - one of the best tagines and certainly the best couscous we ate while visiting Morocco. Chakib joined us for lunch and we learned a lot about how he and his business partner run Morocco Attractive Tours. Honestly that was probably more interesting to us than learning about the Atlas Mountains, or the Berber village life. What is it like to be Moroccan? How do you run and grow a tourist business? Anyway, I digress. Lunch was great - the view was amazing: 360 degree views of the entire valley. We even had a brief thundershower to watch while we ate.The way back was pretty uneventful, but equally beautiful as the rest. We drove through the Oukaimeden Valley on the way back. One highlight was passing through the set of Mission Impossible 5 as they prepared to film on the road.Overall, we had a fun day in the mountains and were glad to have chosen this company. Sure there are some usual day trip tropes - like the shop - but the scenery was spectacular and we learned a lot about Moroccan life as we chatted with our driver Chakib."

            "review": "Stunning ride - underwhelmed by the destination. We travelled on the day tour to Ouarzazate & Ait Benhaddou from Marrakech. This was booked through British Airways, and all the booking and arranging pickup (which we did by email) worked like a dream - we were picked up at our hotel right on time. After a detour into Marrakech city to pick up another couple we were off onto the road, and the trip out was stunning, through the breathtaking and massively scenic Tizi-n-Tichka pass. Our driver was expert and obviously knew the road well, so we made good time despite the twisty, winding road which somehow forged a path through the Atlas Mountains, doubling back on itself multiple times and clinging to the side of ridges, often with a sheer drop on both sides. It's not a road for the nervous traveller, but it's a wonderful experience.There were also plenty of stops, for toilets, refreshments and sights on route and the guide was friendly and helpful with superb command of English and all the trip was relaxed and informal. So much for the journey - but the purpose of any journey is to arrive somewhere, and that's where this experience went slightly awry. We'd initially selected this trip because of the Atlas Film Studios, based in Ouarzazate and home of the Morroccan film industry. On arrival in Ouarzazate we drove past this and it was pointed out, and we went into the town centre, where we had an hour to ourselves, either to visit the kasbah or visit the film museum. We opted for the latter - but it was closed for lunch (!) so we explored, had a quick wander around the kasbah and grabbed a snack. Once back in the 4x4 we went off, stopping to take pictures of the Atlas Studios but only from a good distance away, and we then went off to Ait Benhaddou. This is a stunning UNESCO World heritage site, a Berber village clinging to the hillside and a must-see experience. However, we were allowed 1 hour 50 minutes there, which is a bit odd as it could easily be visited in less than half this time. We found ourselves spending the best part of an hour sitting in a cafe at the foot of the town, effectively killing time. The journey back was uneventful and we got back to our hotel at 7.15 pm after a very long day (11 hours & 45 minutes, with a lot of travelling). A day worth it for the experience of the pass, although I can see how many might find it long and wearisome. The 4x4 was comfortable enough, but, let's be honest, any vehicle with three adults in the back will get a bit uncomfortable after 8+ hours of travelling on winding roads. So you do need a certain amount of stamina for a trip like this.The thing we're more than a bit miffed about is that things seem to have got a bit lost and confused in the middle of the day. For instance : - being taken to the Museum of Cinema when it's closed for lunch (surely it closes for lunch at that time every day?);- not being offered a visit to Atlas Studios (our main reason for choosing this destination, and - annoyingly - we now see that Atlas Studio Tours are available, they're even listed on the company's website!)- we're not quite sure what happened to the promised \" lunch in a restaurant with a panoramic view \". This seemed to evaporate somewhere in the day;- having nearly two hours at Ait Benhaddou. Lovely place, but not sure it's a place worthy of nearly 2 hours. If only some of that time could have been used for lunch, or for a Studio Tour, then this would have been a much. much better day out and we'd not have come back with regrets of what we might have seen - but didn't get the chance to."

We saw beautiful valleys, mountains and a waterfall, lots of Berber villages, traditional Argan oil being made, and more. Chakib even arranged for us to leave Marrakech a little earlier to beat the crowds - which meant we arrived first to all the spots. The car is very comfortable and seems brand new.

We initially booked this trip because we were looking for a good deal, and it was slightly cheaper than other day trips of its kind. We were so happy with the trip and it turned out to be completely different to other similarly-advertised trips. We were picked up by our guide Jawad at our hotel and he was immediately friendly, informative and helpful. There were 4 of us in the 4x4 and it was very comfortable, with good aircon. We drove up to the waterfalls, which was an energetic but not too difficult climb uphill for 35 mins. A separate guide takes you up to the waterfall and it is well-worth the extra money for the tip - definitely choose this option if you go! Following this we travelled through various valleys to a berber village, which was beautifully set in the rolling hills of the lower Atlas mountains. No other tour companies were stopping in this area and we were alone, apart from the local villagers, which felt very authentic. One family have allowed the company to bring people to their roof terrace for a cooked lunch, which was truly fantastic. The lunch consisted of tomato salad with homemade bread and oils, a traditional chicken tagine with cous cous, and fruit. After lunch we drove down through the multi-coloured valleys into the plains below, Jawad pointed out all kinds of landmarks to us and explained the reasons for the colourful soils. The whole day was around 9 hours and I think anyone visiting Marrakech should choose to get out into the mountains in this way, and definitely choose Morocco Attractive."

The Moroccan landscape is beautiful and we think it is a definite must to see it if you have time. We were very hesitant at first about going ahead with the tour as we did not have a great time in Marrakech. People didn't seem very friendly and some were quite frightening. However, this tour showed us a different side of morocco that we did not expect to see. The hotels were most unexpected and a great experience. They were mostly traditional Moroccan hotels which were very clean, beautiful and cozy. Their locations were amazing and the people were very hospitable and helpful. The tour consisted of many activities (the following is the link to itinerary if interested). Our driver and tour guide was amazing and very helpful. I had severe food poisoning from watermelon at a restaurant which caused me to feel very unwell but the driver made sure that my health was taken care of by taking me to the local medical centres which were away from our route and helped translate for us. Despite the food poisoning the trip was very pleasant and I would definitely recommend anyone interested to go with them.Few bits of advice:1. Avoid wearing shorts or revealing clothing as you will be passing through small villages. No kissing or anything intimate either.2. DO NOT eat fruits from the street stalls and DO NOT eat watermelon. I was told that not only foreigners but locals get severe food poisoning from them.3. Do not acknowledge groups of children sound the streets as this can cause problems.4. The journey is very long so be prepared for drives throughout the whole day. (Some may be up to 4 hours long)."

The excursion was to the 3 valleys and lake (but it was end of May so there was no Lake) so we only did the 3 valleys. The guide Chakib is a very friendly man and he is pretty conversational. Moroccan landscape is beautiful so if you like nature and you appreciate sightseeing this might be for you. There is one stop in one Argan shop so I guess this was the delight of my girlfriend. I think the tour is highly enjoyable, although the berber lunch felt a bit fake. Say... you are in the middle of Morocco and only 2 umbrellas surrounded by adobe houses but there we had a gorgeous lunch and it is pretty refreshing, although the sun might be an issue if its intense. The waterfalls are nice to go, but be careful, its a bit slippery. Chakib was there to assist us so I would recommend that you take some trekking shoes if you decide to go to the waterfalls. In addition to the excursion expenses, the berber lunch costs 13 EUR and the waterfalls 7 EUR. You would not do bad to ask about the cost of these activities, just in case my info is outdated.I think this a recommended tour if you want to be free of traffic and the crowded busy Medina. Also, you will enjoy more this excursion if you like outdoors and you enjoy mountain air."

The company made it very easy to make the booking (made prior to arriving in Morocco). The trip was fantastic value and our driver was incredibly knowledgable. We did the 30 minute trek to waterfall, saw beautiful countryside and the lake. However, the highlight of the trip was the visit to the Burba village where we had our lunch. With 360 panoramic views of the landscape (which was beautiful and tranquil) and the most amazing family cooked meal- you will not be disappointed. You really get a feel of traditional Moroccan cooking and living. Again, a trip I highly recommend! Thank you for a memorable experience :-)"

Our guide Chakib was very knowledgeable, friendly and a safe driver so you felt at ease for the entire trip. The scenery was stunning, we climbed waterfalls (not for the faint hearted) followed by lunch in a Berber mountain village which I thought was the best meal of our whole break away. If you are looking at taking a tour of the Atlas Mountains look no further this is definitely the company to go with. Thank you for such an enjoyable trip."

            "review": "Great tours!. Due to the good recommendations we booked two tours with Morocco Attractive Tours and we didn\u2019t regret it! We did the three valleys tour first, where we saw the quite touristic but beautiful Ourica Valley and had a small hiking tour with a second guide, who took good care for our safety on this quite slippery way. We also enjoyed lunch in the berber house in the second valley. Food was good quality and the tee ceremony was quite interesting to see. Especially the latter as well as the three quite different valleys made this tour unique and absolutely recommendable. Apart from that Chakib drove us very safely, gave us useful information and cared for our needs. On the way we also had the opportunity to do a camel ride, which we did not do or to buy argan products, whereas the argan products were quite expensive, so it is recommendable to either negotiate a reasonable price or to buy somewhere else. Anyway it was also nice to see the oil mill. Be aware that the food and the hiking tour makes 20 Euro extra per person, whereas it is worth to do! The second tour led us to Essaouria. Our driver Abdul was also very nice, he cared for our needs and we enjoyed talking to him during the drive. In Essaouria he gave us recommendations about where to eat and where better not. Apart from that Essaouria was also worth to see with the harbour, the old town and the beach. Sellers were less aggressive than in Marrakech and prices were often much more reasonable, so it is worth to do shopping in Essaouria. Thanks to Chakib and Abdul for the tours!"

It was 8 hours of truly fascinating scenery and cultural tradition. Don't even consider hiring a car(not good enough for some of the roads) or 4x4 as the driver will miss out on truly spectacular scenery plus you won't know where to go to experience the Berber culture. We saw Berber women making Argan oil, saw beautiful waterfalls, saw fabulous hand made jewellery, pottery and ornaments, tasted superb Berber food and hospitality. My husband and I think this was the highlight of our Marrakech trip. I don't think you'll be disappointed if you book this trip. Thank you Chakib and thanks to Kamal our waterfall trek guide."

Our guide Chakib was friendly, patient, very knowledgable, and a great driver (which seems hard to find in Marrakech), and picked everyone in our group up from their own most convenient locations. Every view was more gorgeous than the last, and we had the most delicious Moroccan food in the Berber village, with a panoramic view of the mountains and villages surrounding. Our only complaint was that we had to pay extra for the walk to the waterfall and for lunch in the Berber village. Both were definitely worth the money and must-dos if you do the Three Valley Tour, but it was a bit misleading to market them as optional--if we hadn't hiked up to the waterfall we would have just been sitting in the village waiting for the rest of our group to come back, and I'm not sure what we would have done if we had opted out of the Berber lunch. Once again, these were two of the highlights of the trip and we would definitely recommend them, but just expect to pay 20 euro more than the listed price. Also, if you go to the waterfall try to have sturdy shoes you can hike in--we both had unsupportive shoes with no traction and we ended up alright, but it would have been easier and more enjoyable with better shoes.Overall, Morocco Attractive Day Tours did a great job with this tour and it was a great way to get out of the city and see the Moroccan countryside and traditional Berber life. We highly highly recommend it to anyone in Marrakech!"

Chakib our guide/driver was great company and very knowledgeable. He was also a very safe driver which was reassuring round those mountain bends. The scenery was spectacular but the highlight was the traditional lunch in the Berber village- it was the best food we had throughout our stay in Marrakech and in a gorgeous setting. We also did the waterfall walk which was definitely worth it but make sure you have sturdy shoes and a reasonable level of fitness as part of it involves climbing up a fairly steep rocky path. We were really glad we did the 3 valley trip as we felt we saw areas that were a bit less touristy and different landscapes. Chakib continually pointed out things of interest and answered all our questions with enthusiasm. He also made lots of stops for us to take photos. We would highly recommend this company."

Everything from booking to arranging the pick up was seamless, we were even offered to be picked up a day early as the weather forecast was slightly better - a nice touch. Chakib our guide was great! Very friendly, kind and knowledgeable and went out of his way to ensure we had a good tour even though we were the only 2 people on the tour - he even turned into a personal photographer and nothing was too much trouble. He even offered to drop us off at another location other than our hotel if we wished. The first valley in the Berber village was a definite highlight. This included a trek to the waterfalls - this was fantastic although we were not quite expecting the amount of rocks but rather a small trail - even still it was great fun! Lunch with a Berber family was a unique experience and something which is not offered by other companies. This was definitely the highlight with the best food we had tasted during our time in Marrakech. The tour is worth this treat alone. All the valleys and lakes offered breathtaking views which was a nice change from the cityscape and something which was unexpected.Definitely recommend this tour. We will definitely be using the company again to book another tour when we return to Morocco."

Morocco is really a beautiful country! Regarding the organization of the tour I only have two notes to make. One concerns the night in the tent in Merzouga for which I had very different expectations: the toilet was shared, no shower available, we had breakfast at the hotel and not in the desert (as planned) and, the most important thing that we ignored, was about the lagguage that we had to leave in the car. At the end everything was fine but I suggest Chakib or Sara to give to their customers more detailed information about this kind of accomodation in the tent. The second thing si about the hotel in Todra Gorges (riad dar ayour): the staff is very friendly but the cleaness in the rooms is very poor. For other things nothing to claim, indeed... Starting from our guide who has been really patient, kind and reliable. So a special thank to Younes, we will keep Morocco in our hearts also thanks to you... :) !!!"

            "review": "Three Valleys Day Trip. We went on the three valleys trip and had Chakib as our guide. You are driven in a 4x4 that can take 6/7 people. We had 2 other couples with us that we luckily got on well with.We first drove for about an hour to get to a Berber village where we watched them make Argan oil and had pictures with the Berber ladies there. All very touristy and I felt like they were out to make whatever money they can from you - the shop selling Argan products was very expensive. But it was really interesting to see.We then went to go on a \"walk\" to the waterfalls, that costs about an extra \u00a37 per person as you have to hire a guide and takes up to 2 hours. Well this was not a walk but more of a rock climb! Make sure you wear good shoes as you have to climb slippery rocks and cross small streams. I'm not sure the waterfalls are really worth the climb, as they are not that impressive. But the walk was a god experience that we enjoyed. We then drove for another hour and 15 mins to go to Berber village in the next valley, which had completely different scenery and wasn't touristy at all. The lunch we had was a amazing and so filling. But the Berber house did seem a bit fake and set up just for us. This costs an extra \u00a313 per person. After this we got back in the car for some more driving on to the next valley, and we were all getting very tired and sleepy after our meal. We drove to the lake and stopped briefly for a few photos. To be honest this seemed more like a tick the box activity so that we could say we'd been to the third valley.Over all, we would recommend this tour as long as you are fit enough to enjoy the climb to the waterfalls. We had a good day out and Chakib was a good and knowledgable tour guide. Be aware that with all the extras it will costs you at least another \u00a320 per person to do everything in the tour."

We booked the Three Valleys Day Trip from Marrakech with Optional Visit to Takerkoust Lake and Kik Plateau Tour with Morocco Attractive Tours via BA and are certainly glad we did. We were picked up at Jemaa El Fna as the 4x4 could not fit down the Medina road to our Riad. Our guide was excellent and kept up a running commentary throughout the tour about where we were and what we were going to see. He was happy to answer any of the questions of his six passengers and stopped regularly on the drive so we could take breath takingly beautifully photographs.We hired a guide as a group to take us up to the waterfall at Setti Fatma - a walk not for the aged or unfit. It took us around 35 minutes to get up there but would have taken up to 2 hours if it had been during the busy season as the \"path\" was very narrow. It is worth the trek. We could probably have done it without a guide if our drive had just pointed us in the right direction but it certainly made it easier with one.The three valleys; Ourika, Oukaimeden and Asni where stunning. The totally different geology between them was amazing and in places reminded us of Malta or Gran Canaria. We enjoyed the stop off at the Berber village to see how Argan Oil is extracted and to buy some (of course) I thought it was a little expensive at 150bh but my daughter was happy with it when I gave it to her as a gift and it was good to see how they lived and worked and we helped their economy a little.We chose to stop for lunch at a Berber House and we greeted with Harira (soup) followed by a chicken and vegetable Tagine (cooked on charcoal) with vegetable couscous and followed by fresh sweet oranges and Berber Tea (an acquired taste). So much food we all were quiet and a little sleepy afterwards.The views of Takerkoust Lake and Kik Plateau were equally stunning. I'm sure if we'd had time a dip in the lake would have been lovely but we had to get back to Marrakech (maybe next time).If you want to see stunning scenery, not worry about driving yourself and have someone there to answer you questions this is the trip for you.You will need to pay extra for the guide to the falls and for the lunch but you settle that with the driver so no haggling required."

We booked it whilst still at home on the strength of the positive reviews on TripAdvisor and we're so glad we did.We were picked up at our hotel on time by our driver/guide, Gawad, in a clean 4x4 in great condition. Throughout the entire day Gawad was friendly and informative and spoke faultless English. He took time to point out the good stuff and explain lots to us, without being over-talkative or intrusive. We collected another couple from the medina and headed into the foothills and ultimately the mountains themselves. Gawad was happy to stop for photo opportunities and also to take photos for us. We stopped off to watch some ladies making argan oil, then headed up to the cascades where we took the trek up to the first waterfall - make sure you have decent footwear if you're doing this, it's not a gentle stroll and scrambling over rocks is to be expected. Our guide up to the waterfalls (Hussein) also spoke great English and was very friendly and patient, helping us up and down over the trickier parts and was happy to pause for breaks along the way.Lunch on the rooftop of a traditional Berber house was a particular highlight, with the most breathtaking views of the mountains and the valleys and the food was by far the best we'd had during our trip! On the way back we were offered the opportunity to take in the Lake as well - not part of the trip we'd booked - which we did before finally heading back to Marrakech.Gawad offered to drop us off either back at the hotel where we'd started the day, or anywhere else in the city and was kind enough to stop off at a Pharmacy for us on our way back to the hotel. We were collected at 0830 and dropped off at 1700 and thoroughly enjoyed our full day. The guide up to the waterfall, the lunch and the added stop off at the lake were all additional extras, so make sure you take some extra cash with you if you want to do them. None of them were particularly expensive though and all were optional extras and we didn't feel pressurised into doing any of them. A really great day and if we ever make it back to Marrakech, we'll definitely be getting in touch with Morocco Attractive for some of their other trips. Great stuff. :)"

I would say here though that the tour company did not mention that this is was quite a big hike with lots of climbing over and around boulders, and through streams, it was fine for us as we are able bodied, but anyone with a health problem (back, legs etc) might have a few issues. Hiking boots or very strong boots A MUST! Saying that, it was totally worth while doing and the fews are tremendous.We also lunched at the house of a Berber family in the middle of nowhere and that was totally charming and the home made food delicious.

The walk up to the waterfall would be a little difficult for those not overally mobile, however the guide that took us up was very helpful and if not keen on the walk the village it starts at is very interesting, set on a river and very unique. Lunch was very nice, the best tagine we had on our trip, the 360 views while having lunch were breathtaking. Definitely recommend doing this day trip and as per above, this company and our guide were brillant. Cheers. Daniel & Rosie."

Driver spoke excellent English and was informative and interesting but didn't chat incessantly.The views were stunning. The actual trek up to the waterfall was hard going. You need proper walking boots or walking shoes - trainers not good enough. VERY steep and slippy, more a scramble over rocks than a walk. The local guide for this trek was excellent - spoke little English and was very helpful with a much needed sense of humour - he practically dragged us up some bits! Lunch was the highlight of the trip. Sitting on a terrace with 360 degree views of Atlas mountains, silent except for the sound of sheep and the local farmer ploughing with his donkeys. Food was tasty, plentiful and authentic. A welcome escape from the noise and bustle of Marrakech and interesting to see a bit more of Morocco.Highly recommended!"

The car and tour guide, whose name is Chakib and is absolutely fantastic (he speaks both English and French perfectly) picked us up from our hotel. We had a small group of 5 which made it perfect for activities like riding camels and going up to the waterfalls. We visited the three valleys and also specific Berber houses and our tour guide also arranged that we take lunch in a beautiful berber house somewhere up the mountain where the women cooked only for us. The entire experience was fantastic and I would highly recommend it to anyone who is visiting Marrakesh. A lot of thanks to our tour guide who has also been Amazing!!! Felicia Vacarelu - Italy"

If you do decide to go to the orika waterfalls (extra charge), it is a long way up with lots of treking so good trainers is recommended. The guide mohammed was excellent and helped us safely get up there and back down. I would also recommend if possible taking some sweets for children comming up to you. The Atlas Mountains were amazing and we had the opportunity to stop and take pictures of the landscape. We shared a delicious lunch at a traditional beber house, on the top of the terrace, one of the best tarjins you will ever taste and there was plenty to go around! "

Chakib is a great guide and very helpfull and friendly and I can't say anything bad about this trip and the tour organization. He really made the best of it. Because it was raining in the lower regions, it was snowing in the mountains and this made the scenery beautiful. The lunch in the berber house was also really good. I would love to do this trip again in the spring to see all the fruit trees in blossom and leaves and to have some clear sights of the Atlas mountains. I would certainly book again with this tour organization when I go back to Morocco."

Enjoyed it for a while but we seriously booked too many days. Anyway we were looking for a plan B, escape from the hussle and bussle of the old town and drive around in the mountains just outside Marrakech. On TripAdvisor our resource to find (and analyze) almost anything for my trips, we found this company organizing day trips. We've heard the combination of the 3 valleys and the lake was recommended highly. So we send out an e-mail to the company for information and got a call the same day and were able to get on the trip the next day. Great Toyota Landcruiser 4wheel drive, nice and just the thing we needed to relax a day among nature's treasures. We enjoyed the guidance, his comments and the special \"private\" lunch at a Berber family's home, well to be more precise on their terrace overlooking the valley, just beautiful. Really this is worth considering when you're out there. They do have other programs, two or more days out in the desert. Haven't done it, but when I get stuck out there this will be my next trip."

We loved this tour for several reasons:1) The communication with Chakib (the owner) throughout was very responsive, detailed, and helped us make our decisions. 2) Our assigned driver (Omar) was very courteous, professional, and punctual. He also brought us to some of the best tasting restaurants we've been to during our Morocco stay. 3) While the driver was knowledgeable about the surroundings to a degree, at different locations, we were introduced to local experts who gave us more details on that locations' attributes4) We were the only ones in the vehicle (a comfortable modern 4x4), which was especially nice since we could dictate when we were ready to move on5) Customer-satisfaction mindset: was met by the owner, with the driver, the first day to make sure we kicked-off properly; mid-way through the first day, received a call from the owner making sure everything was still going smoothly; on the last day after being dropped off at the hotel, realized we left some personal belongings in the car and were leaving on a flight the next day. The owner dropped off our belongings at our hotel that very night.Highly recommend this tour company!"

Me and my boyfriend visited Marrakech a few weeks ago and before we left we booked Morocco Attractive day tours after reading favourable reviews on tripadvisor. We had sent enquiries to other tour companies but the tour leader Chakib responded to my email swiftly and the rate was more competitive than the others. Chakib picked us up at our hotel and was very knowledgeable and provided us with so much information on his country. We travelled to the 3 valleys in a comfortable 4x4 and shared the trip with a lovely couple from Denmark. The scenery was amazing and I recommend the hike to the waterfall (but bring study shoes /trainers with a good grip) and lunch in a traditional Berber house, we had the nicest Chicken Tagine ever! Before we left the UK I emailed Chakib and asked was there anything we needed to bring for the trip and he suggested sweeties and pencils for the Berber mountain children. I\u2019m so glad he suggested this as seeing their faces light up on receiving these little treats made our trip. On my next visit to Marrakech I will definitely book another trip with Morocco Attractive day tours."

We emailed Chakib from England and made arrangements, he then phoned us when we arrived in Marrakesh to confirm what time he would collect us. We were lucky in that it was just the two of us on the trip which was, in effect, a private tour. The car was comfortable and Chakib himself spoke perfect English, imparting some fantastic information as we drove along (and with a good sense of humour). He was very knowledgeable, full of facts and figures and answered all of our questions.The drive took us through fantastic scenery, where we stopped en route in order to take photographs (Chakib either stopped when we asked him to or knew where to stop in order to get some good shots). The visit to see how Argan Oil is extracted was very interesting as was the explanation of all the different herbs and plants grown in the gardens and the explanation of their usages. We continued on to Ourika valley, stopping to cross a bridge for photos (which Chakib took for us). The scenery was almost surreal with cafe's and restaurants dotted along the river with colourful armchairs, settees and parasols set amoungst the water for diners to sit and also many stalls at the side of the road selling local handycrafts and carpets. Then we met our guide for the treck up the waterfalls. This was truly worth doing and we took tons of photos (our guide also took lots of the pair of us together). we loved the was they used the water from the falls to cool their drinks and fruit like a fridge and enjoyed looking again at the stalls on the journey and were handed free tasters of fruits and sweets by the sellers (however we misunderstood and thought that all the stalls were run by a co-operative which shared money amongst the village - when in fact it was only one of the main stalls, so had we known that we would have purchased our souvenir from that stall in preference to any others, however there was no pressure to buy anything). It is not a particularly easy treck and I would recommend that you wear trainers or walking shoes and leave any bags in the car for Chakib to watch for you, also do not take small children or attempt if you are not too agile, as some bits are a bit tricky or slippery (although the guide is patient and will help you up or down difficult bits). We then drove to a Berber village to have lunch at a family's house. I must say I felt a little bit intrepid as was not sure what to expect, especially due to the very basic layout and the fact their was no running water etc - however, the meal was delicious and plentiful with a starter of bread and oil and tomato salad, followed by a large chicken tagine, followed by a large vegetable and couscous dish then pomegrannate, finishing off with mint tea (so do not have a big breakfast that morning!!). It was so peaceful sitting on their roof terrace away from the everyday noise of London! I would recommend that you take a bit of change so you can tip the lady that made the lunch (we didn't realise and only had large notes so felt a bit mean not being able to give her anything) we then continued on our way traveling along mountain roads and experiencing very different views and terainnes. All in all a very good trip and well worth doing. (we had been to Marrakesh earlier in the year and visited the town and the souks and the hustle and bustle and noise etc, so this was a major contrast as was so peaceful). Thank you Chakib for a memorable day, we thoroughly enjoyed it."

He was very patient and let us take our time when we wanted to stop for photos and admire the views. He never pressured us into doing any of the additional activities. These activities were; a camel ride, a guided walk to the waterfall (7 euros extra) and a Lunch in a traditional Berber village (13 Euros extra). If you do not do the additional activities, you will be limiting your experience as you will be spending most of your time in the car (albeit comfortable). We chose to partake in the guided walk and the Berber lunch. The walk was very scenic, looking down through the mountainous valley. The waterfall was smaller than we were expecting, but the view of the valley was worth the walk. The lunch in the Berber village was certainly a highlight. The location was stunning and the food was delicious. It was a rare opportunity to be welcomed into a Berber home and gain an insight into their culture. This is unique to this tour company and should not be missed! After leaving the village, the scenery of the third valley was incredible."

We stayed in Marrakech for 5 days, but by far the day trip to the Valleys was the highlight. Picked up from our hotel at 9am by Chakib (6 of us) and taken to the first valley. Chakib is happy to stop along the way to allow you to take photos. He explained at the very start, with no pressure, that if we wanted to go on a hike up to the waterfalls at the first valley he can arrange for a mountain guide to escort us (essential) - 1hr 30 mins in total and worth every single second - stunning views and experiences. The next optional part of the trip is to have lunch at a traditional Berber home. Not only was the food delicious, but the setting blew us away. we had a table set for 6 of us on a rooftop which had 360 degree views - No restaurant in the world will match this place for location.!! Would we recommend this trip - absolutely. Would we recommend Chakib and his company - oh yes!! A truly genuine guide only interested in your enjoyment as opposed to many other places where they are just looking to fleece you for as much as possible!! Chakib even bought us all a mint tea at a riverside cafe as he needed 15 minutes to pray ( we had delayed him on the mountain hike !!) A lovely guy and a fantastic day out - Thank you Chakib!"

When it came to the day we were picked up from our hotel promptly every thing was explained about the day in great detail. Me and my wife were driven in a nice Toyota 4 x 4. We went to 3 valleys in total the 2nd one was the best for us as we got to see a real burbers house and eat real home cooked food at the top of a mountain - it was magical, there was no one else around and it was so peaceful! In short we had a lovely day and would highly recommend morocco attractive day tours!Thanks Chakib!"

After reading about Morocco Attractive Day Tours on Trip Advisor, my husband and I were keen to see what all the hype was about and try them out for ourselves! We were not disappointed. Chakib was prompt to respond to all our e-mail enquiries and picked us up promptly from our Riad at 9am. Learning how Argan oil was made, climbing up to witness the beautiful waterfalls, as well as just the simple things like watching children in some of the remote villages play around were some of the treats we got to experience. The authentic meal in a Berber family home had to be the highlight of the trip. The views from the terrace where we had lunch were spectacular! It was so inspiring to see and learn about their way of life. Chakib was a safe driver, entertaining and attentive to each one of us on the journey. The price was reasonable at 60 euros. We paid an additional 13 euros for the lunch and I think 7 euros for the tour guide to the waterfalls. I would definitely recommend this tour to friends and others!Thanks Chakib!Natasha."

Myself and partner had a lovely time in the valleys, escaping the madness of Marrakech! Chakib our guide was very knowledgeable of the area and I found it very interesting being a nature nerd! The Berber woman in the co-op was a delight to meet and chat with as was the Berber family who let us into their home to have beautiful tajine. They even accommodated my vegetarian ways! I would recommend this trip and company to anyone. Thank you Chakib for a really enjoyable day it was a pleasure to meet you and we will be back! Best wishes Linsie & Dave"

The visit to the Argan oil press (perhaps the only less fascinating stop),the guided climb to the waterfalls, the authentic dinner in the Berber home, etc; at first sight, it looked like your typical tourist trap.. But luckily, all other reviews of this organisation turned out to be quite accurate: the mountain guide took us to the waterfall trough a small mountain pass ( only the vendor stalls along the way made it seem a bit tacky ), to arrive at a beautiful little waterfall, far away from the hectic city life we left in Marrakech. The next stop was lunch at the Berbers' house. Having tried several tajines on our trip, this proved to be the best one yet! Whilst heading back and typing this review, my girlfriend and I both agreed that this episode was well worth the price: our driver/host proved to be a well rounded guide, who was able to answer all our questions and knew the nicest places to visit along the way. A recommended trip to all who wish to see a little piece of the countryside Marokko has to offer!"

We had quick response from Chakib to confirm all details and he picked us up on time at the main plaza near our riad. Chakib was very helpful throughout the trip and the 4x4 he drove was comfortable.The 3 valley trip was beautiful with many places you can stop and take photos. The hike to the waterfalls require proper walking shoes as the trek can be slippery and need some climbing. The optional lunch at the berber family is definately worth joining. The view was amazing and the food was good.The price of the tour is a bit higher than the minibus tour at the market. However, the ride is more comfortable and you get a much more personal service. My girlfriend usually has car sick but she was fine during the whole trip in the valleys. I would recommend people to join this company if they are looking for a comfortable trip to see a different side of marrakech area."

Booking two excursions through http://www.moroccoattractivetours.com/ was the best decision I ever made for our recent visit to Morocco.I looked on various websites and emailed people some time ago. Chakib, from Morocco Attractive Tours, emailed back very soon after sending our enquiry, he wrote good English, advised what would be the best trips for our stay and answered my numerous questions.In the end we settled for two day trips - the first to Essaouira and the second to the three valleys.Both were fantastic days out. We were also lucky enough to get Chakib as our driver/tour guide for both days. His spoken English (which is his third language) is as good as any native English speaker (if not better than some!!). His knowledge of Morocco is amazing and he is happy for you to ask questions, he will point out interesting things, but also he is more than happy for you to sit back quietly and enjoy the ride.Ok so about the two trips - Essaouira - this was a nice (but long) day out. The straight road of 170km to Essaouira takes about 2 hours 30 minutes to drive (this includes a 20 min stop at an Argan oil producing co-operative). It is well worth going to Essaouira to see what is holds (very different to Marrakech). My only advice would be to do this trip early on during your stay as you may not appreciate the long drive after you have been in Morocco for a while,Three Valleys - this trip was amazing. So many different landscapes along the way. This trip includes a lot more stops for photos, to ride the dromedaries (approx 100dhms per person), to climb up to the waterfalls (approx 65 dhms per person) and to have lunch at a real Berber home (approx 400 dhams for 2 people). All of these extras are worth adding to the trip. In particular the lunch part was amazing. This truly was a real Berber house, in a real Berber village with the most fantastic landscape to sit in and eat lunch. We were apprehensive about what it would entail before going, but it is honestly the best experience. You eat alone (or with another couple if they are on the tour with you) and are served outside by the girls from the family. You get chance to look around their house and you get to have possibly the nicest Moroccan food you will every taste.We cannot recommend Chakib and Morocco Attractive Tours more highly. Avoid the rest and use the best!Thank you for making our honeymoon even more special!"

Chakib spoke excellent English and was very knowledgeable, friendly, trustworthy and incredibly helpful.I would recommend having lunch with the Berber family. We were a little cynical about the idea but they are very welcoming and it is excellent value for money. The tour includes a visit to a cooperative making and selling natural oils and products, the guide here was friendly and there was no \"hard sell\". The waterfall walk is well worth the \u00a35 for the local Berber guide - the scenery is beautiful and the guide himself was good. We finished the tour with a reasonably priced delicious lunch sat on tables with our feet in the river - a great relaxing afternoon!The day after our tour we regretted having not made a purchase at the cooperative. We rang Chakib who kindly picked it up for us, tried to refuse a tip and then offered to drop us for free at the airport! A thoroughly nice guy, his helpfulness and kindness will be one of our enduring memories of the trip.One thing to note is there was a small misunderstanding over cost - we understood that we would pay $60 each and the tour would be just the 2 of us, but 2 others were also part of our tour. That said, it was a good opportunity to meet some other travelers."

Our guide spoke very good english, and explained a lot about Marrakech as drove out of the city. In the mountains, our guide was happy to stop wherever we asked to take photos, had a lot of local knowledge, and clearly had very good relationships with the local communities. We chose not to have lunch with the Berber family, as it was an extra \u00a310, instead just visiting them for tea. I have to admit I did regret my decision when I saw the food they were cooking for other guests, it looked really good. Another note on this, it was the price that put us off, but the money goes straight to the family, and I believe is quite an important revenue stream for them. The tour company doesn't take a cut.Chakib, the tour guide really was great. One of the stops was at an Argan Oil producing womens co-op. They also have a shop (expect a bit of sales patter, but not too pushy) that offered essential oil for a skin condition I have. I didn't buy it, but was given a free sample that actually seemed to work (I am definitely a sceptic...). I phoned Chakib later in the evening, and he said he was touring to the same place. He agreed to buy the oil for me and drop it off to me! We were on our way to the airport just after, and he offered to take us there for free! I honestly can't say enough how nice it was to meet this guy, really genuine and an excellent tour guide. I have no basis for comparison, with this being my only tour, but I'd certainly recommend them."

In Ourika valley we visited an argan oil co-operative and took a short hike to a beautiful waterfall. In Asni, we ate a traditional Berber lunch cooked by a local family. The mountain scenery in Imlil was spectacular.Tip: make sure to bring an adequate amount of cash as lunch and guide fees (for the hike) are extra, and you will almost certainly end up buying some souvenirs along the way (if you've been to the souks you will understand the obligation).Overall, a wonderful, memorable day, great value for money (even for two students), which we strongly recommend to any visitor to Marrakech."

Chakib uses a relatively new 4x4 which was very comfortable. Before we set off he confirmed the plans for the day and asked whether we would like to amend anything, this was a nice touch. On the way to Essaouira we stopped several times for picture opportunities and also visited an Argan oil cooperative, this was great for the kids and there was little or no pressure to actually buy any of the products.Essaouira is a fantastic place and I would really recommend it as a break to the hussle and bussle of Marrakesh, we had some great food and an easy day in the Souks and the beach.

It is good to escape from the madness of the Marrakech medina for a day. The beautiful and sparsely populated mountains do feel like a different world. We undertook the optional walk to the waterfall in the Ourika valley. The \"walk\" was quite a challenging scramble up steep rocks but our guide, Kamal, was most helpful in ensuring we did it safely. The scenery and clear water of the waterfall made it worthwhile.The trip included the inevitable shopping opportunities at a Women's Co-operative making argan oil and at a Berber pharmacy. The charm of the young women who showed us round mitigated any feeling of obligation to buy the products.We were offered lunch with a Berber family or in a restaurant and chose the former. This was most definitely the highlight of the trip - an opportunity to meet a local family and to see their home, delicious food (Moroccan salad, chicken tagine, vegetable couscous, melon and mint tea) served on a terrace with a stunning view of the surrounding countryside. The family was welcoming and hospitable and we felt privileged to have had a glimpse of lives very different from our own.The trip continued through varying kinds of terrain, villages and vegetation.We were most impressed by our driver, Chakib. He was courteous and informative, a good, safe driver and happy to share information about his own life and Moroccan society in general. Our vehicle was a very comfortable 4x4.The cost of the trip was \u00a350 plus \u00a36 for the guide to the waterfall and \u00a312 for lunch per person as well as tips for the guide, driver and Berber family.Overall, the trip was extremely good value and a fascinating glimpse into a different world.We would not hesitate to recommend this company and would happily use them again."

Our tour started with Chakib picking us from our hotel at the precise time promised. We made our journey but shortly thereafter I had an issue withdrawing money from my card to pay for the trips entrance fees. Chakib offered his own funds but I felt truly uncomfortable and he made a detour to help us find the right ATM. The trip is an all day exercise. There is so much to see and do and Chakib gives you ample time to see and do it all. The landscapes are truly magnificent and frankly difficult to describe with words and to be honest even the pics. What was quite surprising was how much the landscape changed from the morning when we left and on our way back. As the sun goes down the countryside glows a unique red illuminating everything around it. Overall Chakib is incredibly good value. We found him to be considerably cheaper comparatively speaking. Furthermore, we really wanted to see the Oasis (17km) away from the designated route and seeing our excitement he made the exception. This resulted in him finishing a hour and a half later after the tours expected finish. Truly a testament of his commitment to the customer and their experience in Morocco. Well done and thank you Chakib."

We were only there for two nights so I almost didnt book, thinking we would not have enough time, but it was brilliant. You can see the mountains from Marrakech and will regret if you dont see them closer!! You will be so glad to get away from the hectic medina and souks!! It was the highlight of our trip. Chakib from Morocco Attractive Tours was brilliant. We asked him not to stop at the tourist places as we had done our shopping and he obliged. He told us exactly what to expect and how the day would go and we were more than happy. I was unsure about the Berber lunch as I pictured us stiiting in a room with a family, but it was the highlight of the trip... I dont want to give too much away ;) The waterfall walk is also a must.Please dont miss out :)"

Within an our from the time I placed the bolking, I was contacted by mail, and in the mail it was clear what time we where picked up and where. The day began at 8 am this morning with a introduction of our driver, and after that we took of towards the cost. The driver made it clear that whatever we wished to do or see, it was possible. We wanted to visit the argan coopertives on the way - so we did! After that we drove further on to the ocean where the driver showed us his favourite seafood resteaurant and we had a great lunch. Then to the old part of the city, and as we wanted to discover it on our one, that was was we did.

We took the 'Three Valleys' trip advertised the company's web site on Friday 19th April 2013 which took us on a one-day tour by road around the Atlas mountains looking at the varied and beautiful scenery. We also stopped by a Berber market (not aimed at tourists) and had a lunch at the home of a Berber villager.Booking - done easily via email. Meeting Point - the guide, Chakib, met us outside Caf\u00e9 de France in the main square (Jemaa el-Fnaa). Just be careful that you don't get let away by another tour company as it's a busy meeting point.Tour Introduction - Our guide explained the options for the day and was flexible with the agenda and explained the associated additional costs.Guide - Our guide spoke excellent English and gave a commentary highlighting interesting features as he drove us around. He was able to answer questions about the local geography, economy, and society.Vehicle - we were driven around in a modern 4x4 vehicle which was very comfortable even when driving off-road.Lunch - we had the choice of eating at are restaurant or visiting a Berber villager's house for a home-cooked meal. We took the latter which was well worth it. This was a three course meal sitting on a terrace with a beautiful mountain view. Lunch is not included in the price of the tour but this was made clear.Price - Morrocco Attractive Tours seems to be in the middle range price bracket. You'll find cheaper but we found this means a driver who speaks very little English and a forced visit to his uncle's carpet shop. So it's well worth paying a little extra for a tour from this company.All in all this was an excellent day excursion."

            "review": "Superb trip to the Atlas. This was a splendid long day trip out of Marrakech. It was a customised day trip - the company was happy to be flexible about this, and we paid the same price as the advertised Ait Benhaddou / Ouazarzate trip for a somewhat different itinerary. We went southeast into the Atlas Mountains. Our targets were three Kasbahs at Telouet (mountain fortress with exquisite interior decoration), Ait Benhaddou (fortified village like something out of the Old Testament; and the location of many iconic films!) and Ouazarzate (more of an urban castle). Despite being the same kind of structure, each was unique, and expressed the variety of Moroccan mountain architecture. Also splendid was the scenery of the Atlas Mountains glimpsed en route - we drove through very remote regions and were astonished by the contrast of green trees against red rock.The company is owned by a gentleman named Chakib, and it was he who we dealt with to make the booking via Email, which went smoothly. But our driver was a young man called Adil, who was a wonderful guide and companion. He was knowledgable and thoughtful, courteous and kind, and gave us lots of information about the sites, region and country. He also drove tirelessly through a very long day, and when my travelling companion became carsick on the mountain roads, found us a chemist where we could buy some medicine!One tiny quibble - when we reached Ait Benhaddou, we were fixed up with a local guide, who showed us around the village. He too was knowledgeable and interesting, but we were then expected to tip him, which was an additional cost to that we'd already paid. I didn't mind this, and it felt like we were helping to support the local economy, but it might be reasonable for this possibility of extra costs to be highlighted on the website.Still, this was a fantastic day. I'd recommend this company wholeheartedly."

This is a good trip for people staying in Marrakech who are keen to get an insight into the mountain scenery and local traditions in only a day. The guides were friendly, and helpful, with an excellent knowledge of the area and grasp of English. Good email contact made the booking process quick and reassuring.

We were not disappointed! The evening before our trip Chakib, our driver and tour guide, rang the hotel to let us know that there would be a large Berber market two days later which we could visit if we wished to change our days. Unfortunately, this was not possible as the following day was our last in Marrakech, but it was a good omen! Chakib's attentiveness was evident throughout the trip. He arrived to pick us up from our hotel the following morning very promptly and we discussed our itinerary. We were given the option of enjoying lunch specially prepared for us in a home in a Berber village - what an experience, certainly not one to miss. Apart from savouring excellent local, authentic food, we were given the opportunity to meet members of a Berber family and be entertained in their house.Throughout the day Chakib showed his detailed knowledge of the area, of which he was very proud and explained everything in perfect English. He made sure that we got the most out of the tour - leaving us in the very capable hands of a knowledgable guide at the Argan oil co-operative, stopping to give us the best views and, where appropriate, allowing us to walk and enjoy the mountain air, picking us up further down the hillside. On our journey back to the hotel Chakib gave us the bonus of a quick tour of the outskirts of Marrakech, again accompanied by detailed knowledge. To sum up, the scenery is spectacular, the village life fascinating - a trip not to be missed - and I would recommend it to anyone who wants a memorable day in spectacular surroundings, accompanied by a professional but fun guide driving an extremely comfortable vehicle. If we ever return to Marrakech we would definitely use this company for another trip.NC"

The trip took us across the Atlas mountains (and we got some snow on the way back!) to Todra gorges and the desert. The desert trip involved a camel ride across the dunes to a nomad tent, where we spent the night, with a view of the sunrise over the dunes next morning. A sandstorm the previous day helped liven up the camel ride.Our driver Younis was good company, telling us in good English about the sights and the people. He always knew the best spots to stop for a photo, and good places to stop for coffee or lunch. Having your own guide maximises the amount you see, and your understanding of it.The trip involves long drives, but that is an opportunity to see a lot of the country. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to explore the variety Morocco has to offer in safety and reasonable comfort."

Starting with the booking, Chakib (the tour guide) was patient with all my enquires (and I had a few as I was calling around different excursion organisers). We decided on the 3 Valley Tour with lunch at a Berber house, which included pick up and drop off at our Riad. On the day, Chakib's timing was impeccable (an important factor for anyone on holiday). We started the tour with Chakib asking about our preference of the areas to visit (confirming the answers to questions I had asked while booking). This instantly made the start of the excursion feel personal. The entire experience was one to savour throughout. Amazing views accompanied with strong knowledge from our tour guide, Chakib. The picture opportunities were plentiful and Chakib kindly stopped whenever we asked. The Ourika Valley was my personal favourite and Chakib even gave us the time to rest with a coffee overlooking the streams. Chakib's English was immaculate and credit to him, he was able to answer all my questions (of which I had many)!The lunch at the Berber house was very humbling and provided a realistic and grounded experience of Berber life. From start to end, the entire excursion was everything I could have asked. Chakib was extremely accommodating of everything we requested.  I would recommend this experience and Chakib to any friend or family member, confident that it will be a highlight of their trip!Thank you"

The first daily trip was to the Ourika Valley and the second trip was to Essaouira. They are very dedicated professionals who will take full responsibility of your trip requirements. They have preset routes for daily trips but they would happily accomodate changes according to your schedule. The first trip was hosted by Chakib who speaks perfect English. He has a wide range of knowledge about each location and he constantly feeding you with useful information. On our trip to the valleys we stopped multiple times for photos, and site seeing. Various extras were made available to us (lunch at a Berber village, Trekking the waterfalls or stops at local cafes for a refreshing mint tea). The trip was on time and the ride was very good, meeting always safety standards despite the crazy traffic in Morroco. Chakib had communicated very efficiently the plan and he did accomodate any requests that we had. On our second trip we had another driver Abdulrahman who was equally good. Both drivers are engaging in good conversation and will happily show you around all the cool places. I would definetely recommend Morocco Day Tours for couples, families, individiual or large groups. Keep up the good job guys !"

We stopped a few times to take photos as the views were amazing.We paid extra (\u00a310) for a berber lunch and an extra \u00a35 for walking up to the waterfalls so it's best to go with a small group of people as the prices go down dependng on how many people are doing it otherwise if there's just 2 of you the day can be quite expensive.The guide was really nice and friendly, his English was really good and was knowledgeable about the local area.

Our journey started in the morning in Marrakech where we met our driver and guide YounisWe want to say to him our gratitude. He is very modest, charming young man and he showed us the country with a love. Thanks to him we\u2019ve seen a lot of interesting things and loved this country.During 4 short days we visited Atlas mountains (the fantastic Todra Gorges), a small oases, hidden in gorges of the mountains, collected fosils, went down to the dried bed of the underground river, greeted the sunrise in the Sahara, wandered through the narrow streets of Ait Ben Haddou Kasbah \u2026 It\u2019s impossible to list everything !Sahara left unforgettable impressions! We rode camels to reach our camp. In the evening there was fire with some people playing music whilst others cooked dish. The night some of us slept in hessian Berber tents, and another under stars! At about 5am we were woken to watch the sunrise over the sand dunes. It was beautiful !Everywhere along the way, we met very friendly people. And of course, we can\u2019t forget the fantastic cuisine: the best tagin we tried to Gorges, in a village in the oasis Feint we were treated exceptionally tasty olive oil, and in Erzuga we tasted a famous Berber pizza!!!Also we would also like to write a few words about Morocco Attractive Tours. I would also like to write a few words about the company. From our very first contact (in 4 months prior to a trip) everything was very accurate and professional. The tour was perfectly organized, hotels on a route were very good and conveniently located, the program very saturated.100 % of the recommendation!"

            "review": "The Real Morocco. My husband and I booked a 1 day excursion to see the Atlas Mountains and the 3 valleys in that area. Chakib arrived promptly at 9am and we headed off in his very comfortable land cruiser. Chakib asked us what we would and wouldn't like to do with our day so we felt it really was tailored to us. We opted to have Mint tea in a traditional Berber house which was a real eye opener as to how little money these people have and how much we, as Westerners, take for granted. The family we met only spoke Arabic yet this wasn't any issue as Chakib translated any questions we had and showed us round the home. We were then served the tea together with home made bread and olive oil made from home grown wheat and olives and it really was yummy. We were under no obligation to leave a set sum of money but left around \u00a38 from the 2 of us which is over the odds for bread and tea but not given the hospitality and their circumstances. We also opted to take the optional waterfalls hike in the Ourika valley. This really was well worth it and I would say anyone with good mobility and with flat comfy shoes can do it. The waterfalls trip was an extra \u00a37 for 2 and this was led by another guide called Mohammed who lived in the village of the falls. Chakib himself could have done it but under tourist industry regulations, he should give work to locals where possible which I think is a great idea. Mohammed was also fantastic, his English was great and he was instantly likeable. He taught us so much about the area as well as the Country and the culture. Both Chakib and Mohammed answered the numerous questions we had and I felt like this was the one day of our week long trip that we came away with a real feel for Morocco as a country. The scenary was stunning all day long and Chakib stopped at various points along the route to allow us to take photos. I thoroughly recommend this firm for a brilliant day out that you won't forget in a hurry. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0"

It was definitely a highlight of our 6 day Marrakech stay. I did quite a bit of research prior to booking and made the decision based on itinerary and cost with theirs being the best value. I was a little worried when I pre-booked from the US and was asked to send a deposit via Western Union or Moneygram, never having used such a method (typically use credit card). Obviously, we were both relieved and pleased when we were picked up promptly (via Land Cruiser) by Younes, our guide, a delightful, young man who speaks English very well. It was truly a pleasure to travel with Younes as he was able to share so much information and insight into the Moroccan culture and way of life. It was also nice to get away from the crazy chaos of the Medina and see the incredible Moroccan countryside and its' people, many living as they have for centuries. Our trip included visits to the Kasbah Glaouet, Ait-Ben-Haddou, where we over-nighted in a very simple but friendly hotel, then a tour through Ourzazate where we also toured the Atlas film studios. The last stop on our tour was a trip to Fint Oasis, a lovely hidden gem, where we had tea with a Berber family in their home - a truly authentic experience. Overall, the trip of a lifetime which we highly recommend! (Am happy to share further information should you have any questions.) Thank you again, Younes and Morocco Attractive Tours! We hope to see you again someday and do a longer trip..."

I called about three of them and this company sounded the most professional. I spoke to a guy called Chakib who was very helpful and accommodating. I sent him my requirements by email and he came back to me promptly with a schedule and a very competitive pricing. There was no pressure to pay just an understanding for booking.Once we arrived at Marrakech, we had our first trip and Chakib was there promptly to pick us up at the time stated. The tour and sites we were taken to were spectacular and Chakib was extremely knowledgeable. I had asked for a lunch to be included in my trip and the highlight was going to a local Berber house up in the mountain and eating Tagine and Cous Cous on their roof terrace. And it was an experience using a toilet which was a hole in the ground. The food was amazing and by far the best Tagine and Cous Cous that I have eaten in Marrakech. This will be a moment to remember. All I can say is that Chakib is great and the service is second to none. Make sure you look him up and call him to arrange pre departure. Also make sure you ask for Chakib himself, a lovely chap and so genuine."

We then stopped for lunch at a restaurant in the valley which served delicious food (this is an extra cost - although not expensive), and we were then taken up to the some waterfalls by a local guide (this too at an extra cost - also cheap) although the trek to the waterfalls isn't for the fain hearted, as there was a lot of climbing involved!!

The guide also told us about things we drove past and gave an insight, which was good. The guide that took as around the waterfall was very experienced and carefull this made the trip even more enjoyable, the car we had was also nice and clean and comfortable. If I went to Morocco again I would call Chakib to arrange another tour as I felt comfortable in his presence, he was well mannered and had very good English so communication was very good. I had already booked him before I made the trip and agreed on the price beforehand, he did not once mention this to me on the trip. Most people would probably try to get more money but Chakib was not like this. This tour company is very good and reliable, keep up the good work Chakib."

My partner and I have just returned from Marrakech which we loved, especially the trip into the Atlas Mountains to see the three valley's. Our guide, Chakib, spoke perfect English, was very polite and provide a great insight into Morocco and life outside of Marrakech. The trip was a full day but was at a good pace and we even had tea with a local family in one of the villages along the way (it was really eye opening to see how they live). This trip is great value and well worth it."

Morocco Attractive Tours were recommended to us and as it was our last day we were limited on time. But Chakib our guide arrived on time and tailored our trip to maximise the time we had left. He was very knowledgeable and polite. We had a fantastic day and would recommend him to anyone. When I go back, I will certainly use him again."

From the first day we completely fell in love with this great city. Besides Marrakech we also visit some other cities around it, like Agadir. It was a great experience. We could ask our guide everything about marocco and we get so much interesting information about it. This amazing trip was really above our expectations. I definitely recommend Marocco Attractive Tours for a fantastic experience in a lovely city"

We have booked a day trip to the Atlas Mountain with Morocco Attractive Tours on a recommendation of a friend, and we have chosen the 3 valleys excursion, It was really amazing we have visited a lake, we passed by Kick plateau to reach the Asni Valley where there is the Richard Bronson Kasbah, then we continued by a mountainous road to the ourika valley, our guide and driver Chakib was verry helpful and friendly and he speak a fluent English. So he proposed to us to visit a berber house where we had a cup of menth tea with a wonderful view from the terrace of this house. in the ourika valley Chakib help us to find a mountain guide to do some trekking and to visit the ourika waterfalls, after that we had lunch in a good restaurant with a view on the river. I Highly recommend Morocco Attractive Tours."
