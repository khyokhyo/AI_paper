            "review": "A must do attraction in Sydney. On a nice day the ferry ride from Sydney's Circular Quay to Manly is a fabulous way to see a large section of the whole harbour area passing the iconic bridge and opera house along the way. The ferry takes 30 minutes each way and with ferries running regularly throughout the day (twice per hour?) getting to Manly is easy. Once in Manly have a meal or just stroll on the beach with an icecream!This is a very popular trip with tourists so ferries can be busy. Top tip - go on a Sunday when there is unlimited public transport on an Opal Card for $2.50"

You can buy them at most groceries and sundries around the downtown area. I had some extra time on the weekend and was encouraged by my local co-workers to head over to Manly Beach by way of the Manly ferry. I'm glad I made the trip! In about 30 minutes you go from dock to dock and get to experience the beautiful Sydney Harbor with all the major site from the water. You also get a sense for just how beautiful the area is around Sydney. The visit to Manly Beach was well worth it, too. Quaint beach town with all that comes with it. Great place to hang out and people watch."

We went on Sunday morning at 9am, and I do suggest if you prefer to not stand in long queues, to set off early. Sydneysiders are not known for rising early, so there were not a lot of people around at this time. The view of the Harbour Bridge, Opera House and inlets along the trip are stunning. We chose to take the slow ferry as it provides more photo opportunities. The trip is around 30 minutes one way. No ticket office open on Sunday, so will have to purchase tickets via machine. Suggest you take the trip if time allows."

Travel from Circular Quay, adjacent to the Circular Quay train station, to Manly Wharf. Depart from the Quay wharf between the Opera House and the Harbour Bridge, and travel part Taronga Zoo to Manly. Worth a day to look around Many and enjoy the beautiful surf and harbour beaches. One of the only places in Australia where both the calm harbour and exciting surf beach, with lifesavers, are within 500 metres (flat walk) of each other. Don't forget to thank the crew. They jump off and rope the large ferry securely to the wharf at each stop."

Great views of the harbour Bridge, skyline and he heads. Give yourself time to wander from the Manly terminal to the beach at Manly and find somewhere to eat and make a day of it. Get an Opal card before you visit Sydney so you can use it on the ferry and other public transport. If its a fine day get to the terminal early to snag an outside seat and swap sides for the return trip so you can see all of the harbour"

The views are great, there's plenty of seating and free wifi. The one thing I would say about my most recent experience (last Saturday) is that there were not enough ticket machines and the queues were very long- we missed getting earlier ferries both going there and coming back due to the queues. The ticket offices weren't open so you had to use the machines and they didnt seem to offer return trips? We didn't have opal cards so we had to buy single trips and there is surely a way to make the purchase of tickets more efficient? Other than that, it's a great service :)"

            "review": "An enjoyable outing. Ferries run from Circular Quay to Manly and back all day long, usually at half-hourly intervals. You can buy single trip tickets at machines, but an Opal Card is more convenient. The trip differs from Inner Harbour ferry rides in that you do not need to \"tap off\" when exiting either wharf. The ferries are quite large vessels, double-decked, with a shop selling refreshments on board. The journey takes about half an hour in each direction. If the weather is fair, try to get on in time to snare an outside seat, as the views are great and inside seats, although comfortable, allow for less viewing - also, often the windows are none too clean due to salt spray. Seats outside at the front of the vessel can be windy but there is nothing quite like the experience of crossing the entrance to the Harbour, when the Pacific Ocean rollers are coming through the Heads, with the bushland on one side and the horizon stretching away in the direction of New Zealand on the other. The fast ferry\" services, which are privately operated and take only 15 minutes in a catamaran (not a hydrofoil) cost much more than the government service (from Wharf 3 at CQ) and are really meant for commuters who are not concerned about an experience and just want to get to or from work - also Opal Cards do not work for these services. When you reach Manly, walk straight ahead along The Corso for about 400m to reach Manly's wonderful ocean beach."

Taking about 30 minutes to cross the Harbour the old boats, which are spacious and atmospheric, travel back and forth from central Sydney to the quieter world of Manly and it's famous beach."

The slow one is definitely better because it is roomier, larger, gives you ample time to take in the passing scenery, especially the Opera House, the Harbour Bridge, Fort Denison, Garden Island Naval Dockyard, the Governor-General's and the Prime Minister's Sydney residences, the many bays and beaches and \"the Heads\" (entrances to Sydney Harbour). And the cost? $17.90 one way. A bargain! The ferries leave from No 3 wharf and tickets are available from easy-to-use machines, which take coins, notes and credit cards. There's a snack bar on board; also toilets."

Can't see any scenery from the seats and staff shout at anyone who ventures outside. Use buses (great driver didn't charge anybody because the ticket machine was broken!) or trains if possible. I note that I am not the first to report on the ferries' poor staff attitudes. This is God's own land, the best country in the world, and there is no place for lowlifes, most of whom are, thankfully, confined elsewhere and never sully its shores. Long live white Australia and long may it defend itself from lawbreakers."

The ferry itself was a smooth ride (good, because I'm prone to seasickness) and there were chargers to plug your phones into to recharge on the inside wall. So handy!

Manley is just beautiful you walk from the dock on one side of the finger of land to the beach on the other side.

A half hour trip from Circular Quay on one of the Sydney Harbour ferries will bring you to Manly, passing the Opera House and Harbour Bridge as well as having a great view of the city. There is no need to book this trip but it is popular so arriving in good time is recommended. Purchasing an Opal transport card (kiosk at the Quay) with sufficient funds on it to cover the return trip is the most efficient way to travel and can be used for other public transport in Sydney.

It was not a great day for the ferry as the southeast winds were pretty stiff and it was a bumpy ride from Manly based the Heads. As they slowed nearing Sydney, the ride smoothed out. We had some spray early on and many people went inside though I stayed out and got a little wet. When we approached Sydney Harbour and some terrific views, people came out and blocked many of the views for pictures and selfies. This was a little frustrating since none of them were willing to deal with a little spray early in the voyage.At under $9 AUS, this is a worthwhile trip. Take the slower ferry which offers longer views and go to the upper deck."

Got some great pictures of the sunset and they even stopped in the water for us so we can get great angles of the sunset. The fare was cheap and they do get packed, but they have several pick ups through out the day and night. The boat holds about 100 to 200 people, with upstairs, downstairs and along rails outside. When we went it was packed in the night time. You can see all the sites and the lights was beautiful. Sights to see!"

Trip takes about 20 minuets, you can enjoy a cup of coffee, and cake too. then arrive in Manly to a lot more tourist attractions. There is also a fast ferry, if in a hurry take that. If you are adventurous,(I like it being an old seafarer) then take this trip in stormy weather, although they stop the service if the weather is too bad."

The return ticket to Manly may be a little steep compared with the rest of the city's relatively affordable public transportation system, but opal card owners (which you should be even if only a tourist) will be relieved to know that the system caps at $15 - meaning that taking this ferry for one return trip renders the rest of your daily transport free.Personally, I would say that the best time to take the trip is just as the sun is beginning to set. As it leaves the harbour you will be treated to lovely views of the sun descending behind the bridge, and the 35-40 minute trip ensures that you arrive in Manly with a little bit of light left to take a stroll along the Pacific waterfront with.Manly is nice in itself, with a decent selection of chain shops as well as independent ones offering better deals than you'll find in the city centre - particularly on alcohol. The advantage of a sunset ride is that one will arrive at the waterfront just in time for happy hour; with a discount glass of wine in one of the many restaurants one can see the Pacific gradually get darker and darker before catching the ferry back after some food.At night, the views are even more priceless; particularly when seeing the Sydney Operahouse, Harbour Bridge, and city centre all lit up. The outer deck gets a bit cold with the spray after dark in winter, but the inside is of a normal temperature if you want to briefly thaw. Regardless, I really recommend taking the trip over for an evening; it is well worth it for the view alone, never mind the lovely town of Manly itself."

Fantastic views of the harbour and a nice little rollercoaster ride as you get close to Manly and you feel the effect of the rougher water from the Pacific, as it pushes through the Heads. The beach at Manly is very nice and there are plenty of eateries and pubs. Pop into St. Matthews church. It is worth a look."

Ok, so it doesn't go under the Sydney Harbour Bridge and it doesn't visit all the nooks and crannies, but it does take you past the Sydney Opera House and you do get close to North Head (you can even see the recent rock fall). Then there is Manly itself and lots of things to see and do with it's own character and charm and unspoilt views of the open sea. The ferry runs twice an hour and takes 30 minutes. You use your Opal card, there is no need to tap off and it takes your money on the tap on. With the $2.50 Sunday fare cap we actually did this for free!"

Manly was a cute little beach town and we enjoyed watching the people frolic in the ocean. It was a wee bit too cold for these American's but we enjoyed our day nonetheless. The ferry ride back to Sydney was spectacular at sunset to view the beautiful Opera House and Harbor Bridge. Needless to say we were not the only tourist wanting to see the view so it was a bit crowed on the front of the ferry. Ferry was very clean and ran professionally."

The Manly ferry is a great way to get some beautiful on water photos of the opera house, Garden Island, harbour bridge and north shore of Sydney. Due to new transport rules though, I would recommend purchasing your single ticket (no returns now!) in advance if you don't have an OPAL card. There were many tourists who missed their intended ferry trip and had to wait for the next one (30 minutes later) because the line at the Manly Ferry Terminal was ridiculously long and many did not understand how to use the machines (don't go to the OPAL card top up machine only). Ferry Terminal staff no longer sell tickets over the counter but were assisting in tourists using the machines to buy their one-way tickets. Overall, once on board the ferry it was beautiful. Calm day. Perfect weather for winter. Mostly a lovely experience, despite the wait to purchase a one-way ticket at each wharf. Will buy an OPAL card next time I travel to Sydney for convenience sake."

We love the slow pace of the Sydney Ferry, especially when we have the time to simply enjoy the ride. The views are beautiful, especially on a good day (on a rough day, I'd avoid the Ferry unless you're a \"thrill-seeker\" with a strong stomach or you don't have a choice)! We normally \"make a day\" of it and take our time having lunch or the many attractions of Manly. The Manly Ferry trip is one of our favourite Weekend activities."

Sunday's only cost $2.50 for travel on ferry, train or bus anywhere in Sydney. Great value compared to usual ferry cost. Takes about 30mins to Manly and there's a cafe with food and drinks available onboard. They also have charging stations for your phones & devices free of charge. Sit inside or outside. Lots of fun especially for visitors to Sydney. Highly recommended."

Fast ferry, or otherwise, wind in your hair, sun on your back, bright crystal water, well, whatever the day throws at you, it can't start better than this! And coming home to beautiful, fun and lively Manly every evening, reprising the fabulous sights of the Sydney 'Coat Hanger' and the amazing Opera House, is just unreal. Every one should live here and do this.... If only for a week on vacation. "

There's a pedestrian/shopping mall, the beach, cafes etc. Watch the surfers. You might even see a whale (as we did), while having coffee overlooking the beautiful sea.Manly is a great area to visit , and you'll have the advantage of going on the Harbour and seeing all the Sydney icons that you'll want to photograph from the water.Brilliant on a nice day. 5 stars."

We took the ferry to manly in the day time and aDuring the night on the way home so we were able to experience the best of both worlds.When you get on the ferry I suggest quickly getting a good seat outside on the second level facing Sydney both ways.The views are spectacular, I personally really liked seeing Sydney at night all lite up. However it's hard to see some of the islands so going for both day and night is ideal.The boat was fast and smooth with tones of room.The only down side is that it is very touristy.... Lots of people pushing to the front of the boat to take pictures."

I spent some time on the deck and froze - but the views were spectacular. This is a relatively cheap journey (especially if you have an Opal card) and a nice way to fill in some time on a holiday with something different.There are many cafes, restaurants, places to have lunch once in Manly, the ferry leaves every 30 minutes or so, and it gives a really great view of the Harbour."

The ferry leaves from the quay near the Sydney Opera House every 30 minutes and is about a 30 minute journey. It is accessible by using the Opal transit card that can be purchased near the ferry (and all over town).2. It is a nice way to get a unique view of the opera house, harbour bridge, and coastline. If you sit inside, make sure your window opens as soon as you choose a seat because sometimes they are very dirty- not the best for picture taking.3. The journey takes you to Manly. At the offloading point there are shops, as well as information about Manly Beach. It is a relatively short 300-400 metre walk to the beach. The beach is crowded, and perhaps not as iconic as Bondi.4. Lots of restaurants and shops along the way. For those wanting to save a few dollars on bottled waters and snacks, there is an Aldi market among the convenience stores and tourist spots at Manly Wharf. They have 1.5 litre water bottles for 65 cents."

It's an inexpensive way to get around and my kids love to try out different modes of transportation, even though I tend to get seasick on the ferry. The view is spectacular and Manly is a great place to spend the day with all the beach, shopping, and restaurants just a stone's throw from the ferry. There always seems to be live entertainment and a festive vibe. The ferry operators are always cheerful as well."

Along the way, you will have great photo opportunities of the Opera House from the ferry, the views of the harbour including the Harbour Bridge, the Naval, yard, Fort Denison and the expensive homes by the harbour. You will pass Sydney heads where the boat will rock from side to side. If you are outside, you might get wet. I have been riding on the Manly ferry regularly since the 1960's I have been on the ferry when the railing has dipped down and touched the water while crossing the heads.Some people will ride the ferry to Manly and not bother to get off as they are only interested in the harbour views.However, In Manly, walk to the beach, go for a swim if it is hot enough! Get yourself some real Aussie fish and chips. Feed some chips to the seagulls. It is not healthy for them but they don't care! There are pubs you can drink in, ice cream parlours, souvenir shops etc as well. When you have finished at the beach, walk back to the wharf and catch the ferry back to Circular Quay.On current pricing, the ride to manly and back will use up the whole of your $15 daily cap on Opal. But the good news is that any other travel that day on public transport with an Opal card will be free. Whether it is another public ferry, a public bus, the light rail system or a city train."

You get to experience the Harbour from the water, see the Harbour Bridge and Opera House at a much closer distance and all the little bays along the way. Used by tourists/visitors and locals too. Seating inside and out. If you're quick an outside seat up front on the upper deck provides for the best views. Manly is one of the iconic seaside destinations in Sydney. Definitely recommend a visit if only to stroll along the seafront. Lots of beach view cafes and restaurants as well as other retail opportunities too. Good cliff top walks too - pick up a leaflet at one of the Tourist Information Centres."

A 35 minute trip that crosses the heads and gives you a feel for the wonder of Sydney Harbour and how amazing it was that he found it. At the other end are good places to eat, Manly beach through the Corso - or stay on board and enjoy the view back ot the city"

One of the best ferry services in the world- approximately 40 minutes from Circular Quay to the first of 21 bea hes of northern Sydney. Named by Captain Phillip, leader of the First Fleet arriving in 1788, the famous Corso of Manly is a pedestrian walkway which connects the harbour to the Pacific Ocean some 20 minutes from the wharf. The regular ferries move approximately every 40 minutes across North and South Heads.

When we reached circular quay & made enquiries at the counter they told us we had to pay for the return trip to darling harbour. Only when We made noise & complained that we've already paid in advance for the trip back that the manly staff routed us to the next ferry to darling harbour without paying extra. I mean why should we when the cancellation was done by manly ferry & no updates or announcement. What was supposed to be a direct trip from manly to darling harbour in 17 mins took us an hour of travel from manly to circular quay to darling harbour!Humbug!

When the sun is shining, the views are amazing and if the weather is bad, it becomes a fun ride! Hop off at Manly Wharf and take a stroll around The Esplanade or over to Manly Beach and dig your toes in the sand. Grab some fish and chips and enjoy the adventure. This is a must do when in Sydney."

If you decide to travel on a Sunday it's a lot cheaper. Purchase an opal card near the entrance and you can hop on and of all public transport for just $2.50."

The ferries in Sydney are efficient, reasonably priced and take passengers around one of the most beautiful harbours in the world. We love using Trip View Lite app to hop on and off ferries. They always arrive at the scheduled times and offer spectacular scenery. Our favourite trip is to catch the Circular Quay ferry to Luna Park, walk across the Sydney Harbour Bridge and catch the Darling Harbour ferry around to the Maritime Museum at Pyrmony. A great day out!"

The ferry trip to a manly on a sunny Sunday was so fun, and an unexpected bonus was a surf-lifesavers carnival on the main beach, in addition to the small Sunday market in a street off the Corso. We took a bus to North Head and walked the easy trails, which include a set of memorials to various Army units, to the lookouts over the sea to the east and south. Make sure to check the times of the bus, as not all go right to the beginning of the trail at the former barracks, and the last service is rather early in the day despite it being summer EDT."

It's a pleasant trip and at the destination a feast of food, fun and festivity awaits. From decadent varieties of ice cream, to pies, seafood and traditional fish and chips, your taste buds will thank you.

Watch out for the very confident seagulls that will cheekily swoop down and grab your food!

Slight choppiness in the open sea but lasted only a couple of minutes.The views are amazing with the Opera House, the Harbor Bridge and the surrounding bays.A trip to Sydney is incomplete without the ferry ride to Manly. The beautiful harbor bridge is a sight to behold.We told the evening ferry ride back to the city to catch the sunset. This is even more breathtaking. With the sun setting behind the Harbor Bridge, the sight is unforgettable.Highly recommended."

Boattrips are always a recommendation because of the perspective from a distance onto the city. Manly Beach is a good place to enjoy the Ocean, for me a better place than the more famous Bondi Beach. This is because there are lots of nice shops restaurants and bars available alongside the beach. Worthwhile a trip."

Running every half hour the ferry trip to Manly is a stunning way to see the wonderful Sydney Harbour by day or by night.In fact travel from Circular Quay across to Manly in the day. You can walk across the narrow strip between the harbour and the ocean beach and go surfing or sit and have a coffee. Take the harbour walk around to Fairy Bower, visit the weekend markets.Visit one of the many restaurants or a local hotel.At the end of the day catch one of the evening ferries back to the city and look at the city by night! Wow that is some view"

The ferry was an excellent and comfortable way to see the sights of the Harbour and to be to beautiful Manly Beach.Manly has a very nice beach and hundreds of nice restaurants and shoppes. The beach is about a three block walk from the ferry terminal. We walked one of the trails that start and end at the ferry terminal along the beaches and to the National Park that sits above Manly. There were many spectacular views of the waves crashing on the rocks below and we were able to see beautiful views. You should wear sturdy shoes and carry water if you decide to walk the trails but they are worth it.The visitors center at the ferry terminal provided us maps and directions. They encourage us to carry water and there any many free water bottle filling fountains all along the town center and beach area. Manly was beautiful and clean, and the people were friendly and helpful.A great side trip as part of a Sydney visit."

Also make sure you get off the ferry and spend time in Manly, you could easily make it a day trip, go to the beach, have breakfast or lunch, visit SeaLife (not sure if that is it's correct name).

These Sydney ferries are great and the Manly trip is one of the longer rides ( as is Watson's Bay on the other arm of the harbour opening) giving great views of Sydney from the water. Definitely do one of these ferries even if you haven't time to explore at the destination. It doesn't have to be Manly unless you want to visit the area."

They did offer drinks on the ferry on the way over if you can't wait to dock... But the real reason I'm writing is the amazing sunset trip back from Manly to the quay.. A must do, standing outside on the deck, the sillouette of the hills, the sun reflecting off the water, the amazing colours as you approach the bridge... Priceless.. Loved it..

You'll get great views of the Sydney skyline, as well as the iconic Harbour Bridge and Opera House. Manly itself has an excellent beach, loads of shops and some good coastal shops - so in my view it is the best boat trip to get out or the harbour."

They leave Manly wharf at a quarter past and a quarter to the hour.And if you are a visitor to Sydney, the short walk along the Corso to Manly beach is another must do. Manly has plenty of cafes, restaurants and pubs too if you get hungry."

Watsons Bay is also a great trip."

Our 4 day Sydney escapade included my very fav Manly Spit Walk. For the inexpensive price of a ferry trip to Manly this is a must-do day trip for similarly inclined active travellers.The ferry trip to Manly as always was a treat. To be out on Sydney's gorgeous harbour and so near The Heads is a must for all visitors. The day was perfect and the choppy swell added to the experience.Arriving in Manly we bought a few picnic supplies from the ferry terminal situated Aldi. After a quick stroll through the mall up to the beach we started our 10k walk. As always it was wonderful and for Rene it gave him yet another insight into Sydney's spectacular natural harbourside environment. Stopping frequently at small beaches and coves along the way and taking time to appreciate the lookouts my regard for this walk was again cemented. A well deserved coffee at La Plonk at the end and the easy bus ride back to,the city made for a perfect day out in Sydney.Catch the Manly Ferry and walk the harbour. You'll love it."

The ride takes about 30 mins. and if you lucky you might spot dolphins :-) Be aware that they close the gates a few minutes before departure. When going towards Manly the best spot is on the rear upper deck, so be quick to catch a seat there.

If its a 'bit choppy' the ferry can move a little, but more importantly the waves can splash over the bow. If you are sitting up the front, you will get wet.

(Bookings maybe required at The Boat House).It's a pleasant return walk back to the Ferry so you can walk off lunch. There are plenty of Shops along the Corso and then the nice ride back to Circular Quay."

The Harbour is very busy with racing sailing boats, cruisers, and other water-crafts. From Circular Quay, be ready to take photos of the Opera House, Fort Denison , the Harbour bridge and more. You may experience a bit of swell when sailing pass Sydney Harbour Heads on a rough weather day. You will enjoy the arrival at Manly ! Go for a walk through the mall, along the esplanade and if it is a nice sunny day , enjoy a swim. If you feel speedy, hire some roller-skates ! The surf is always good. Plenty of restaurants, take aways food and shops as well ! Make it a day trip !"

Living in Sydney I can honestly say for a visitor it represents the best \"bang for your buck!\" You get to see the amazing jewel of my city. A sweep past the opera house and you are heading east towards Manly. A good half hour trip where you'll catch glimpses of secluded beaches, national parks and the fortunate few Sydneysiders that call the harbor home. Once at the other side Manly offers great restaurants, shops probably Sydney's best beach and a lovely \"must do\" walk around to fairy bower on the eastern side or head left off the ferry and walk around the foreshore past Fairlight and around to forty baskets beach or continue walk until you arrive at the spit for a great lunch and a bus back to Manly. Either way it's a day well spent."

If you are in a hurry (fast ferry is 12 minutes faster) or if you are prone to seasickness, you might want to choose the Fast Ferry as the catamaran configuration is more stable, particularly when passing across the Heads where the swell from the Tasman Sea can be large, causing the regular ferry to roll and pitch and occasionally spray those on the forward outside decks!"

For less than fifteen dollars you can see a good chunk of Sydney's massive harbor, from the Opera House all the way out to craggy North Head overlooking the Pacific. This is the largest of the ferry boats that ply the Harbor and it's easy to see why when you start bouncing over the swells as you get closer to the ocean (and also big, of course, because it's mobbed with beachgoers on a nice weekend day). Keep an eye out for tiny beaches, old sea caves, and wartime fortifications along the bluffs.Once you get to Manly it's a straight walk through a pedestrian mall to get to the beach itself, where you can gaze out into the Pacific towards New Zealand while you snack on ice cream."

I didn't know much about it but I was up for some fun. The ride over is cheap, the fast ferry may be a little misleading, you're thinking you're going to be going at a pretty good speed and while it's not slow, it's not overly fast either. That's not a bad thing considering the view you have especially on the way back. It would be great do to it at sunset or on a beautiful day. We went on the day after Australia Day which was overcast unfortunately. Definitely a must thing to do in Sydney and certainly something I would do when I go back."

Despite being a Saturday (and lots of tourists like us) - we had no problems finding good seats. Ferries ran really regularly so we didn't have to wait more than about 5 minutes each way (although that might have been luck).It's also a great way to see the Harbour bridge, Opera house and other islands/channels from the water - you can go outside and get a bunch of great photos + views.If you had to commute every day for work not clear how good/efficient it would be - but for us was a perfect outing (not often you can say the actual transportation was as fun as the destination).Price wise - we had an octupus card + already used up the $15 daily limit with other train trips etc - so didn't really cost anything at all too!."

We caught the 4.00 pm Ferry across and found that the staff at the terminal were friendly and polite. The Ferry was clean and certainly is very different to how it used to be in the sixties. 30 min later we were at Manly, just a little swell as we crossed the heads. The sights on the harbour are always enjoyable. After dinner with our daughter and grandchildren we caught the 8.45 pm back to the quay. We were right on departure time when we arrived but the staff made sure that we got on without trying to hurry us up. The trip back at night paints a totally different picture of eh harbour as the foreshore lights up. You \"turn the corner\" and there in front of you is the Opera House and Harbour Bridge.We also were lucky as the Queen Victoria was at the Overseas Terminal, just to add to the occasion. You never know what cruise ship will be at the terminal and this can just add to the occassion.The trip across to Manly is certainly something that we should more often on the Ferry"

But generally it OK, the ferry is always safe and in the evening/night it is good to see that they have security, this is most valuable on Friday evenings and the weekends when there are a lot of traveler that have had a drink.

From Circular Quay, you get a great view of the coathanger (Harbour Bridge), travel past the Opera House, Fort Denison (Pinchgut) and Garden Island naval station. On most days it's a nice journey on the world's most beautiful harbour with plenty of sailing boats, pleasure craft and the occasional cruise ship floating by. As with any boating experience, a little caution goes a long way. The Manly ferry often has to negotiate the prevailing currents when the ocean is pumping through the heads. Sitting outside is very pleasant when the conditions are benign but it's not unusual for people to come running inside after getting soaked by the waves.  If you have young children then supervise them very closely, especially outside on the lower deck as it can get a bit rough and wet underfoot."

World class view!As a special treat, catch the ferry to Manly and leave Circular Quay around sunset in Autumn when the bridge can be spectacularly silhouetted against an orange sky.If you are feeling braver, take the trip when big seas are running.

The ferry has indoor and outdoor seating which afford fantastic views of the harbour, the Bridge, the Opera House, and the bays along the coast line. The crossing from the south side to the north side can be quite rough at times and it makes for an exciting and sometimes disconcerting ride for a few minutes. If you're standing or sitting on the lower outside decks you could get quite wet.Upon arrival in Manly it is a short walk down the Corso to the gorgeous expanse of sand and sun.

The ferry does give great views and is a good way to see the harbour as a cheap tour but avoid Sundays as the rate is reduced to $2.50 which is great but the queues to get on board are long as a result and the views of the back of peoples heads crowded all around somewhat spoil the view of this lovely city. Better to pay the $15 and go another day. (Also beaches packed out on Sunday)"

If you enjoy the water and boats you'll love this trip. The trip takes you from Circular Quay past the bridge and Opera House across the harbour and out through the heads. The day we caught it was a beautiful early spring day so the combination of nice warm sun and the gentle rocking of the ferry across the currents was just wonderful.Sit outside on the deck and just take it all in as the old boats take their time across the harbour."

We arrived as the workers were making a mad dash to get home on a Fri arvo & was probably extra busy due to a cruise ship in town. We used our Opal card to swipe on & off, asked for direction to the appropriate wharf & waited a short time for our ferry.On board we took a seat outside which gave us a great view of the wharf area, was quite warm with the sun beating down but once we were moving the breeze cooled us.After dinner, we wandered over to the beach and strolled up and back. Most of the shops had closed other than eateries so we made our way back to catch a ferry home. We sat in the same spot as on the way over which this time turned out to be the back of the ferry as it does not turn around when leaving the wharf.

Late summer and sea breezes beckoned, so we took our Canadian visitors to Manly by ferry.The first comment heard, after an ocean swim and a walk around the pathway to Shelly Beach (approx 2km round trip) was that this inexpensive outing is one of the unsung great day trips of Sydney. Our visitors were more than satisfied.Everything was reasonably priced - perhaps dirt cheap. The ferry trips, the pie for lunch and the iceblocks from a well-known German supermarket. The change rooms are free, likewise the surf, beach walk and other facilities, each of which was clean and welcoming.Of course, dearer options are available, but why not have an energetic, relaxing day and grab a few classic photos of the world's best harbour from the upper deck of the ferry?This is a great way to spend a day."

When riding the ferry system around Sydney Harbour, purchase an Opal pass and you will save of few dollars."

Take your camera and see Kiribili house, the harbour bridge, the opera house and much more. However one of the ferryticket gate attendants managed to keep me waiting for 10 minutes , yep 10 minutes whilst they chatted to a friend and when i had to butt in politely to ask a question about the service they didnt bother to help me and said i dont know and went back to chatting to their friend. Possibly the worst customer service i have ever encountered !!"

I last went there in about 1983/4, and I remember taking a picture with just ONE person sunbathing on the beach.... I guess its fame and popularity mean that it is now packed, however I decided to take the ferry and go and have another look... Except...Like most (Australian) cities for getting about on the buses and trains in NSW you need to have a ''travel card'', an Opal card. On Sundays you can get on any of the Sydney harbour ferries for only A$2.50, so guess what the queue for the Manly ferry at Circular Quay is miles long as every man and his dog is going there..... In fact the Sunday I was there they announced that there was a one and a half hour wait, which I would say makes Manly a very crowded place on a Sunday.You can of course take the fast ferry which you have to pay a lot more to get on, but strangely most of the tourists seemed prepared to wait for the A$2.50 fare!I ended up going to Watson's Bay instead which was very pleasant and at least gets you a ride on the harbour for some nice picture of the Opera House and the Bridge, but then you can get good photos of both from the Botanic Gardens...You have been warned!!"

You'll get to enjoy also views of the real estate along the water front, and cast a green eye on passing yachts. If you're lucky, a regatta race may pass you by - that was exciting and fun and certainly brought back great memories for me!"

The service is totally dependable and even in rough weather the trip is exciting. It leaves every half hour and takes 30 mins. For the journey. The ferries do need upgrading but there is something romantic in these old boats. The whole experience is well run and efficient and there is a cafe on board in case you didn't pick up at either end. Love the journey. Good way of travelling to Sydney to see the sights there."

It was a bit rocky on the way over, despite it being really sunny and generally calm, but on the way back tonight it wasn't as bad at all. The views that you get of the centre of Sydney are really good, especially of the harbour bridge and the opera house. There were also loads of sailing boats out this morning and it was fascinating watching them all on the water, especially when they had to move when the ferry sounded its horn!You can get refreshments on board too, which we didn't buy, but worth knowing. Good to be queuing to get on from about 10-15 mins before sailing time as it gets really busy. They open the gate about 10 mins before it's due to leave, once they have emptied the ferry coming the other way. The best place to be I think is the back/front of the ferry, depending on which way you are going. You can stand up and get the best views. Watch out on the way back though as this is that is the area most likely to get wet!"

Did not bother me as I used to be in the Merchant Navy and had seen much worse, but my wife was not impressed.Other than that it was an interesting way to see the extent of Sydney harbour and surrounds.

The total ride takes around 20 mins one way and there are ferries every half hour. It is reasonably priced - $15.20 for a round trip per adult. It gave me a great opportunity to click some great photographs of the Harbour Bridge and the Opera House."

I'm glad to say it hasn't changed over the years, the kiosk is still on board there is still the mad rush to get a seat upstairs up the front, the cost is probably appropriate considering the maintenance and up keep involved. It's lovely to take the arvo off and stroll down to the beach for a play in the water then leisurely stroll back and take the next ferry back to the city, my little boy loved every minute of it."

Go on a Sunday from Wharf 3, circular Quay (the Sydney Harbour) and get an opal card with $10 on it. The fare for the whole day caps at $2.50 so you can make it a really cheap trip, as that will get you there and back. When you get to manly, the main beach is not the one just as you get off the ferry, you have to walk a bit through the town to get there. Grab some cheap snorkeling gear on the way (I'll explain soon). There's a restaurant on the front called The Manly Grill which does the best ribs and sweet potato fries you'll eat in Sydney. From there, go to Shelly Beach. I cannot recommend the snorkeling enough, for both adults and children. You see some amazing fish, catfish and other sea life and it's all free. What an amazing day, all for $2.50!!!"

The ferry has plenty of seating on 2 levels inside and there is also seating outside for great photo opportunities. There is a kiosk serving hot and cold food on board too. There are different ferries going to different parts of Sydney, all with great prices.

There are also 2 beaches, a little one near the harbour and a large one on the other side, ideal for surfing."

Cost was reasonable and would have been even cheaper had I kept my OPAL card which I bought to get from the airport to the city. I think if you spend more than $15 in a day, all your rides after that are free. Something like that. Anyhow, the ferry was easy to find and board. Nice views. Sit upstairs if you want even better views. Snacks are available for purchase. Coming back in the evening was REALLY nice to see the different color shades of the sky against the Opera House and the Bridge. I'd highly suggest using this to get out to Manly if you want to get out there."

Okay, truthfully, I didn't look at all the views in Sydney, but I would highly recommend taking the ferry, either just for sightseeing or to spend the day in Manly Beach (its beautiful). The ferry takes about 30 mins and cost around $8 AUS each way. You can sit up front and be outside. On a beautiful day, it feels like absolute heaven. It can be a little rough on bad weather days, but if you're going for sightseeing, definitely plan on a clear, sunny day. You can purchase a separate ferry ticket or pay with your opal card (you won't need to tap off). I believe they ran every 20 minutes or so up until about midnight."

As of January 2016 you are still able to travel as much as you want on Sundays on all Sydney public transport for $2.50 with an Opal card. While this is still in place, one of the best things to do is to get out onto the harbour by taking the ferry to Manly from Circular Quay. Note the express Manly Ferry is a private line which takes 20minutes - great if you are in a hurry - but is not part of the Opal Sunday deal.You however want to enjoy the ride on the one that takes 30minutes and it still gets you to the same destination. Be prepared to get there early (15 minutes ahead of schedule) to get you towards the front of the queue so you can get yourself an outdoor seat. Be aware that, while that sunny open deck seating you found feels good quayside, after 10 minutes in the blazing hot sun without sunscreen/hat, you may find it to hot to handle, so choose wisely. Getting an outside shady spot is the recommendation to keep cool and get to take in the harbour sights but predicting which one this will be in advance given the time of day/direction of the ferry etc is harder than it sounds! Good luck!"

The ferry trip was very pleasant and light snacks were available on board. The frequent, reasonably priced service runs throughout the day into late evening so you can really have a full day in Manley. It takes about 30 minutes. The beach is very nice and you can walk along the front for quite a long way - a very pleasant stroll. There is a full range of places to eat to suit all. Then coming back of an evening to the buzz of Circular Quay really completes a lovely day."

First part was lining up to get on board the ferry as on a weekend it can get very crowded but it takes more that 500 people so don't let the crowds distract you. Once on board if it's a fine day an outside seat would probably be the best for a first time visitor but be warned it can get very hot on the 30 - 40 minute run across from Circular Quay to Manly and you could lose your hat unless tied down, but you can still just walk around outside whenever you want.. This is a great way to see some of the sights of Sydney Harbour as the ferry makes its journey to Manly. There is also a snack bar on board for food and drinks both hot and cold. Awaiting at the end of the journey to Manly wharf is the main surf beach 150 meters away plus many shops and restaurants down the main Corso to the beach just follow the crowds. All in all this is a rather inexpensive day to see the harbour and the beach if ever in Sydney. For our overseas folks. The ferry wharf at Circular Quay is about 100 metres from the Opera house/Botanical gardens and 200 meters to the old rocks area. You can also get a ferry from here to Darling harbour if you wish. Something not to be missed when touring in Sydney."

I could have run backwards and forwards on this ferry for the entire day.Manly itself is worth a walk around and the cliffs nearby are beautiful.Top tip is that if you are going to be tootling around Sydney for a few days, get the Opal Card to bring the price way down. Even paying day ticket prices it is worth the trip at AUS $15.20, but with the card you can bop around the harbour all day for less than that."

The prime ministers house was one of the place pointed out. The ferry itself is quite old but this ads to the fun and experience of it. You can buy snacks on board an there's toilets. You can sit outside or inside when its too cold. Manly is worth a visit and there's a very pleasant walk to do around the bay. Lots of cafes bars etc."

The boarding of the slow or green ferry is also slightly disorganised first time, but the staff seem very pleasant and helpful. On the city trip we sit on one side (port) and return on the other as the ferry does not turn around having dual helming positions. Viewing the Manly foreshore is always a delight and unless there is a very rough sea, the crossing of the Heads creates an impression of the big wide ocean world beyond the Heads. The nudist beach below the south head is mainly populated by men. Watson's Bay and Vaucluse, also the homes of the wealthy, soon give way to Nielsen Park swimming pool. Having passed the rocks of Sow and Pigs you can see why many a sailor has met his nemesis on them, The wide bay opens up to Clarke Island , Sydney's most expensive suburb of Point Piper, in between Rose and Double Bays. The naval dock - Garden Island looms in the foreground next to Darling point. Sydney's early settlement was centered around Farm Cove which sits in the shadow of the Opera House. All the time a full view of the Harbour Bridge dominates the front. A turn to port (left) and the ferry is sliding into Circular Quay. Disembarking is straight forward in that a lot of transport emanates from \"Quay\". Turn left and follow the covered walk to a large selection of restaurants and at the end the Opera House. For the return trip pick up a guide map to show you the location of the Kirribilli House and Admiralty House."

There is usually a rush to get the best seats for viewing the Harbour Bridge and the Opera House.

If you are visiting Sydney, and in my bias opinion, I would rather take a ferry ride to Manly Beach rather than a bus ride to Bondi Beach!"

The Ferry provides close up, picture perfect views of the Sydney Opera House and the Sydney Harbor Bridge, and it's a nice ride through the harbor on a pretty day. There's a reason this is rated in the Top-10 of things to do in Sydney. It's more than worth the price of the ferry, and Manly Beach is a great place to hang out. As a tip for travelers coming to Sydney from overseas, I would highly recommend ordering Opal Cards on-line a month or so before your trip. We received the cards and activated them on-line before we left the U.S. for Australia, and they worked perfectly well on the train from the Sydney airport to downtown Sydney's Circular Quay moments after walking off the plane. The Opal Cards work for most of the trains, ferries, and busses in Sydney, and they couldn't be any easier to use in order to get around."

We found it better to stay in the upstairs middle of the ferry if your traveling with people who suffer with sea sickness. You get a great view coming back into the harbour if you stand at the front of the ferry. (but be aware, if it is a exceptionally nippy day (storms, rain, high wind) standing at the front of the boat whilst going through the heads might result in getting soaked as a huge wave crashed.

If you only have a short time in Sydney, a trip on the Manly Ferry is a must as it gives you spectacular views of the Sydney skyline, the Harbour Bridge and a taste of what the yachts go through when they start the Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race. When you arrive at Manly, follow everyone up the shopping precinct to the ocean beach. While there walk around to the right to the island beach and look at the water dragons which live in the rocks there. A wonderful outing for anyone wanting to experience Australia's beach and seaside cultures."

Great photo opportunities of the Opera House and Harbour Bridge. Be careful if you take the ferry from Pier 6 as it is the fast ferry and is more expensive and does not accept Opal cards."

Its about 30-40mins from Circular quay to Manly but it seemed really quick as we were busy taking in the sunset ( best time to go ) . There is a cafe on board and toilets but this visit we didnt use either. Very enjoyable trip- take a jumper and a camera as there are heaps of photo opportunities along the way ! The one downside is purchasing tickets. It is so confusing and the machine will only print out 1 ticket at a time. For those with an Opal card they obviously dont have to worry about this probably."

The Manly Ferry is relatively cheap for a 40 minute ride down Sydney Harbour from the city and site of the First Settlment across to Manly - named by the first governor because he thought the local people were a \"manly\" looking group! It is a great trip and takes you past the Opera House and Bridge for photos, Garden Island and the naval ships, around Bradley's Head with its Masthead of HMAS Sydney, next to Taronga Zoo, and then past Middle Head and the entrance to Middle Harbour, past the opening to Sydney Harbour and thence to Manly. Once there you can walk up the Corso to the ocean beach. The ferry is used by commuters in the week and by many visitors when it is packed on weekends. There are toilets on board and a small cafe with coffee, drinks, cakes etc. You can wander around the ferry and if the sea is rough go to the front outside and have a shower! Many people stay inside and look through the salt encrusted windows but outside gives you the fresh sea air and much better photographs. Enjoy!"

The Manly Ferry is one of the best since it goes right up and past the entrance to the sea. At Manly come out the Ferry Terminal and carry straight on to cross to the other side of the peninsula. This brings you to Manly Beach on the Sea. Stop here for an excellent place to soak up the sun on the lovely sandy beach. Alternatively, turn right and follow the coast right round the tip and back eventually! to the Ferry Terminal. This is quite a long trek (I'm guessing over 3 miles) but well worth it for the views - collect a local map to make sure you don't get lost. Back in the middle of Manly there are lots of good shops and restaurants and try the local ice creams!

The staff is very professional and courteous, the boarding and alighting at the wharfs is so comfortable and orderly, and ferries arrive and depart on schedule. Considering all the above the ferry tickets are priced pretty reasonably. An excellent service.Manly itself is a fun place to be and it would seem that the place wakes up only at dusk and stays awake until the wee hours of the morning. Teeming with nightlife. There's also a long beach at the other end of the road, that's good for a long walk, with plenty of seats under shades where you could relax and have a bite and a drink. Seems clear to me now why there's this legend painted on a wall as you come out on to the road from the wharf : \"Manly: Seven miles from Sydney, a thousand miles from care.\" Spot on."

Like a second rate Luna Park, but I thought it was better. They had a cool spinning house. Not anymore. But still, they have the aquarium. The Manly beach is really close too. If you wanted to have a really good Sydney experience, you could catch the Manly Ferry to Manly pier, then walk through the Mall to the beach. It is a proper beach too. With waves. Not like in Melbourne."

Ferry takes about 30 minutes and there is plenty of seating the best being outside then you see Sydney from every angle. Passing the Opera house and under the Harbour bridge great for taking pictures. Ferries are clean and on time. Get an Opal card for use on local transport system. Once in Manly, there is a good choice of places to eat and drinks along the beach front. Take a walk along the beach front for some great views and some very nice homes. Go on a Sunday when there is a market selling interesting gift items. The best thing about travelling on Sunday is that it will only cost $2.50 all day."

The ferry brought us around to Manly wharf, Watsons Bay, Fort Dennison etc. Quite an eye opening trip to see various water sports activities which Sydney has to offer. Great for old couples who like to a short sightseeing and theres just a great sense of safety to be on board with the people working on it. Heres my pic with the lady who multitask so many roles to make sure that tourists like myself can have a good safe trip. Kudos to her."

Just a bit expensive . One way is more less 7 au dollars but if you get an opal card( prepaid for free) and maybe take 8 rides ( need stay minimum one week so) you can take the ferry to go everywhere for free from Friday to Sunday including. Someone could think you already pay for it ( which is true cause one ride by bus, from western or eastern subburbs to the city center is 3,50 au dollars !) but come on ... Is Sydney :-)))"

Manly beach is beautiful, and was well patrolled by lifeguards, on the beach and in the water. I am a confident swimmer, but found the waves too powerful to want to swim, but I enjoyed paddling up to about waist height and being pounded by the waves, which could sweep you off your feet if you were not careful. Great fun though! The ferries were regular and on time, and clean. Very enjoyable!"

Whilst Sydney's Ferries look old, they offer you the cheapest way to see the wonderful harbour Sydney has to offer. For under $10, you can travel to Manly - arguably the most beautiful beach and town that has an amazing beach, restaurants and cafes. I took my family which includes 3 kids under 7 on the ferry on a sunday morning. You need to be near the front of the line to secure a seat outside the ferry - which is the best spot to be. With spectacular views of the Sydney Harbour, Harbour Bridge, Milsons Point, Kirrabilly House (PM's residence) and then you are treated to a 30 min ride to Manly. Up until the NY, if you decide to go out with your family on a Sunday, you can take advantage of the $5 all day pass per person. This allows you to travel around Sydney by Bus, Train or Ferry ALL DAY ... You simply can't go wrong ! But you need to have kids to qualify for this ticket.Upon arrival in Manly, you are then in a HUB of shops, cafes, bars & restaurants - only to be outdone by Manly Beach which is truly amazing. Smokers - you will need to refrain from lighting up in Manly - it's pretty much a smoke free town ... unless you sneek one in the side streets ! With such a variety of places to eat, there's something for everyone's taste and budget. Breakfast / Brunch venues are bursting with customers - it can be a challenge to get somewhere for the kids to sit down or play .. My favourite place is Ribs and Rumps - which is on the main street overlooking the Beach. Not cheap, but it serves up Ribs and Steak to perfection.You'll have a great time, and then you get to relax and take in the sea air on your journey back to the city ! It's a must for any Tourist to Sydney."

Sit outside to catch the sun and have the best place to take pictures (only possible on the lower deck, not many places!).Use the opal card: if you've spend 15 dollar on public transport in one day, the rest of the day is free travel, including the ferry! Otherwise, after the ferry, the rest of your public transport will be free that day."

Why bother paying for a more expensive option when you can have a leisurely cruise across the harbour. Tickets were about $15 round trip. Once you get to Manly There is a fantastic surfing beach with shopping and a street market. Perfect way to spend a Sunday. I would just recommend going earlier in the morning to avoid long lines. Plenty of great photo ops along the way."

The ferry took about 25 minutes and gave great views of the opera house, the bridge and the islands as you sail to and from Manly. There are lots of great bars, coffee shops and food outlets at the Manly terminal and well worth a visit and a stop before heading for the beach."

I rated the ferry 4/5 due to the beauty of the ride on a sunny day, the dependability of the service for the price, and the holiday spirit of they day. However, the restrooms services were limited and the crowds were overwhelming. I do not think the safety of the ferry was compromised, but the crush of people on the ferry was oppressive mid-Sunday afternoon. We made our return trip after dark, crowds were non-existent, other passengers were mellow and appreciative of the beauty of the night sky. Beautiful views of the Opera House coming and going. Manly Beach: This is a gorgeous beach with great waves for surfing. (Unfortunately, the day we were there, surfers were on the beach but a shark sighting kept most out of the water so we missed a full display of their talents.) We took the ferry from Circle Quay in Sydney to Manly Wharf and walked over to the beach and around to Shelly Beach. It was a Sunday afternoon, and even though cloudy, this was clearly a \u201chappening\u201d place. Lots of young adults, lots of music, lots of families, lots of couples, and all having a wonderful time at the beach. The walk from Manly Beach to Shelly Beach is dotted with \u201cart\u201d, a salt water pool, and beautiful houses just above the trail. Walking more informal trails on cliffs just beyond Shelly Beach, we saw 2-3 whales out from the shore, breaching\u2013a beautiful, breathtaking sight. Parasailers were out on the Manly Beach when we wandered back just before dark in late October. Most of the crowds were gone from Manly Beach by then. Restaurants were still open and sparsely occupied on this Sunday night. The ferry, though very crowded on the mid-afternoon ride to Manly Wharf, now had very few people and it was very easy to get beautiful night photos of all the striking sites on the way back to Circle Quay. TRAILS: There are many and they are varied. There\u2019s plenty of walking to be done on flat level surfaces. At the end of the paved walkways, there are more irregular trails that are very walkable though not level nor clear of roots and rocks. Beautiful day at the beach with as much or as little activity as you chose. OPAL CARD: We used an Opal Card for all travel during the week we were in Sydney. Maximum charge is $15.00 a day/person for any combination of bus, trains, light rail, and ferries. Sunday travel on ferries is $2.50 max for all travel all day. Purchase Opal card in convenience stores in Sydney for immediate use, and to avoid lines at stations. Cashier can explain details further."

The arrival and departure times may change at short notice due to safety regulations because of unexpected severe storms or very rough, choppy sea conditions, check for announcements. It takes about 30 minutes for this journey. Tickets for the ferry ride could be obtained from dispensing ticket machines at the wharf.At Circular Quay visitors can expect a hive of activity. Arrive earlier at Circular Quay to see and enjoy the many activities happening at wharf side. On the day of my visit there was a cruise ship docked at the cruise ship passenger terminal. There were many buskers playing the guitar and other musical instruments and statue men dressed in costumes with faces and hands painted in bronze or gold, standing still like statues, or performing slow doll-like movements. There was a group of Aborigines, one was playing on the didgeridoo, while another was performing an Aboriginal dance mimicking animals. The dancer\u2019s movements keeping in time with the deep resonant music coming from the didgeridoo\u2019s long wooden tube wind instrument. A few other Aborigines were looking after their works of art on display. Hand painted Aboriginal art on boomerangs, shells and materials were displayed on the pavement. When the ferry arrived at the pier, people on board disembarked first before passengers could board the ferry. There are two levels to board the ferry. The cabins are air-conditioned with comfortable seats and sliding windows above the seats to look out to sea. There is a kiosk where hot beverages, drinks and snacks are sold. There are toilets on board. No smoking is allowed on the ferry.After the ferry has left the wharf, as it cruised across the harbour it was delightful to look at the many picturesque sights of Sydney icons like the Sydney Harbour Bridge and Sydney Opera House. A great opportunity for enthusiastic photographers to get good photos of these sights. The harbour had its usual activity like fast jet boats zipping past, sailing boats with sails swinging to the left and right trying to catch the wind and a seaplane flying low over the harbour taking tourists for sight-seeing tours of the harbour. One just have to sit back to look at the many sea activities, ocean views or enjoy the brisk sea breeze and look at the spectacular harbour and scenes of the shoreline greenery melting into the sea.On this trip, the ferry encountered the rolls from waves from incoming swells coming in from the North Heads Entrance. This caused the ferry to roll and pitch as the ferry turned to approach Manly Wharf, but after it turned, it sailed into calmer waters. Quite a thrill for passengers. A very pleasant journey on the ferry."

The fare in October 2015 for a return trip from Circular Quay to Manley was AUD$15.20 per person and given the destination alone that is worth every penny. Plus it's handy that you get different views of the bridge and the Opera House as well as seeing something just a little outside the city centre. When you get off the ferry at Manly we were advised that if we crossed the road into the main shopping street or The Corso as it's called and walked to the end of that, it brings you straight to the main, large beach which is lovely. However, we were advised that once we'd arrived at that point turn right & follow the obvious coast path and that took you to Shelly Beach, as you get there, there is a lovely restaurant called The Boathouse, the walk along the path is great, but likewise the food at this restaurant was also great, see the main review for that restaurant."

It can be rough and scary sometimes crossing the heads but then you see North Head and the Quarantine Station where they have ghost tours, Accommodation and a beautiful restaurant.

And this one is considerably shorter and for us, the weather was considerably warmer. This really is a great way to see the approach from Manly to the heart of the Sydney downtown/CBD. Sydney is not actually on the coast, and this ferry ride from possibly the most well known coastal suburb, provides a wonderful ride into the heart of the city, and made me more fully appreciate the selection of what was to become Sydney. Today the ferry passes naval dockyards and shore communities while the famous sights appear and start to fill the view. This is the way to see the Harbour Bridge and the Opera House. We came from having been dropped off in Manly, so it was an exciting arrival in the CBD for us, but I suspect doing the return from the Wharf out to Manly and back would be just as exciting. Only New York's Staten Island ferry could possibly challenge this experience."

The bonus is that you end up in Manly with lots of options of things to see and do. As noted, it's also the best way to get good photos of the Harbour Bridge and the Opera House that you can't get from shore. The ferry is often crowded so if you want to sit on the upper deck, be sure to arrive at the dock a few minutes before the ferry arrives and board via the platform that services the upper deck of the ferry directly from the dock. You can,, of course, get to the upper deck from inside the ship but it may take too long to do so and the good seats will already be taken."

But the good thing is that it is included in the daily quota of your opal card of 15 dollars max cap. Definitely to go since it's 'free'. Heard also that Sunday it's only 2.50s the cap for the oral card . But again, not everyone reaches Sydney just on Sunday. As for the journey, it reminds me of the free ferry to Staten island. first advice and tip.go to the back end of the boat which is facing the jetty which you board. You leave the boat, first greeted with the scenery of the jetty and the skyline of the Sydney,then followed by close up of the harbour bridge on your right and the Opera house in your left. Then followed by both the bridge and Opera house view and followed by all ( Opera house harbour bridge city skyline) Reaches manly island in 40 minutes. will, u can enjoy urself at manly beach. But it was beginning to drizzle so we quickly returned back to the city on the same ferry. Nice way to relax and chill in the evening as well. And since it's one of those it's a must do thing in Sydney, just go with the hype and enjoy urself there :)"

There is a fast ferry but for tourists the regular ferry is preferable giving one time to appreciate the harbor and its views and history. No commentary but read the guide it's sufficient. The ferry also crosses the shipping channel at the harbor entrance (The Heads) and one often feels the full might of the Southern Ocean as it rolls in. Great fun and not long enough to induce sea sickness. Since 2015 is the 100th anniversary of Gallipoli it was easy, and sad, to imagine all those young men, fully of hope and vigor, sailing past The Heads never to return. The war memorials across Australia bear testament to their sacrifice \"Lest we forget\""

I would highly recommend this ferry ride, look up the sunset time and then plan a round trip that will end up back at circular quay around sunset.You will have about 30 minutes leeway after sunset time before it gets dark and you would still get the spectacular views on the return leg from manly. If you have an opal travel card it is a very cheap excursion. Stay on the boat and don't get off at Manly and then it's an hour long ferry ride.I would recommend trying to go to the upper deck at the back of the boat for good pictures. "

Taking the ferry across the fabulous Sydney Harbour allows you to get better views than the wealthy sitting on their balconies of their mansions overlooking the water and you don't need to pay $10,000,000+ for the privilege. For someone used to taking the train or driving to work, it is a fun experience to be on a ferry with your family and see people using it as their regular means of transport to and from the city - commuters next to tourists. We were lucky, the water was calm, the air was warm and it was an absolute delight."

What could be more Sydney than a trip on the Manly ferry from Circular Quay to Manly and back, so on a sunny afternoon we jumped a ride to Manly. The ferry was full of a variety of locals, holiday makers and sightseers. The trip down the harbour provided a great chance to see how the city wraps around the harbour and to note the different areas. The ride was smooth and sunny which was just a perfect way to sit back and relax. The crowd on board was cheerful and the was an expectant air of excitement of the beach to come. The ferry are functional without being super comfortable but have toilets. The trip passed quickly and was a rest chance to sit, talk and take photo's. The trip back from Manly to Sydney was wet, as the weather had changed and the ferry was packed as people sort to return home. The weather made for a bumpy ride but nothing to cause concern or (for those who get queasy) sea/motion sick. The ferry area at Circular Quay soon was in sight and day ended. Tickets are easy to purchase at self help machines and if unsure there are assistants around. 95 of the people travelling that day knew how to use the machine and time tables are posted on the walls. TheSyndey terminal could use some modernisation but is functional. From the Manly terminal it is only a short walk to the shops and beach."

You will see the Harbour Bridge, the Opera House, Fort Denison, North & South Head, small harbour beaches & the approach to Manly pier & its beautiful harbour swimming beach, along the way. You can sit inside or outside on two different levels, at the front or rear of the ferry. There is a small kiosk on board & the 1/2 hour trip is just long enough to enjoy a relaxing cup of tea or coffee.The ferry is the perfect way to enjoy the harbour & then the wonderful destinations at either end!

It rund frequently every day of the week until late. If you are travelling on a Sunday it is worth getting an Opal Card as the maximum you will pay will be $2.50 return. This must be the cheapest sightseeing trip ever."

The Manly ferry has an iconic history going back to 1923 when the Scottish built ferries were sailed to Australia to provide a transport service between the city and Manly. Into the war, on to the 50's and 60's and beyond, these same ferries transported commuters to and from their work and homes. Rolling across the swells that came through 'the heads' of Sydney Harbour, nobody was late for work thanks to these marine workhorses. Of late they are more anonymous in their design but still give commuters an ocean cruise at the start and finish of their working day. For a tourist, the Manly Ferry unfurls the beauty of Sydney harbour as surely as the first sailors and settlers must have seen in 1788."

Cruise around the harbour, sit inside or out and take all the happy snaps you like with phone or camera. The ride is just long enough about 25-30 mins, then stroll around Manly and see the surf beach and/or bay beach. If you feel like a walk go to Fairy Bower from Manly surf beach or take in the aquarium on the far side of the bay beach. Then take the ferry back and sit on the opposite side. I do it every time I go to Sydney."

If you're on a budget buy grab some lunch and ice creams from Coles which you walk by on the way to the beach."

We took ferry to Manly, get real windy at times so make sure you hold on to your hats and caps cos mine flew off into the sea! Luckily able to retrieve it back when cap washed to shore :)Great relaxing way to see the habour and picture taking for everyone. Evening rides can get bumpy almost like a roller coaster ride with high waves. Great ride for the adventurous ones at front of ferry but not for the faint hearted! Be sure safety first and always grab on tight when high waves come! Will definitely take the ferry again."

It is a large ferry so there is an air of excitement about crossing the harbour on it, particularly when crossing the heads which can get a bit choppy. The views of the harbour, its activities and its foreshores are lovely and a stroll around Manly and its beaches relaxing. Make sure to walk around to Shelly Beach which is not only a lovely walk along the foreshore, but a gorgeous little beach cove with a great view back to Manly. Manly itself can a bit overcrowded in summer but if you head straight for the beach or one of its walks you can escape the crowds. It can all be done at leisure with easy access."

A return trip is less than $20 and a great way to get your bearings of the city. On the way to Manly, North Shore is on your left, the Eastern Suburbs (like Bondi) are on your right.

The Ferry itself is fairly cheap and provides great views of the harbor as you go through it. I even saw dolphins and another boat saw a whale on their journey across! It takes 20 minutes but is worth it. I prefer Manly to some of the other Sydney beaches such as Bondi as it has a more local feel and is way less tacky. The views are stunning and there are plenty of good restaurants to grab a meal or a drink as you wander around."

It is a relaxing 30 minute ride with great views of the harbor. The ferry terminates at the Circular Quay in Sydney. From there, it is quick walk to the Opera House, the Rocks (historical area), the botanical gardens, and multiple harbor side restaurants and bars. Driving would take almost a good hour and parking is a nightmare. Best way to travel - hands down!"

The trip from Circular quay (city) to Manly (beach) takes about 35-40min and is a wonderful way to see the harbour. The ferry takes you past the opera house, shark island, many harbour beaches and best of all it passes in front of the cliff heads that open the harbour to the ocean. You can choose to sit inside or out. Chairs are basic but comfortable.Manly has a seaside holiday village feel. It has both a surf and harbour beach, a promenade between the beaches which has several bars and other standards for such a tourist area. My father loves the Manly Jazz festival which runs 25Sept to 5 October 2015 this year, its 38th year. "

I really recommend going on a Sunday since you only have to pay $2,50 (Opal card users) for all public transportation during the entire day, which in my opinion is quite unbelievable. A normal one-way trip to Manly with ferry on any other day would be $7,18. So it's definitely worth it doing touristy stuff where you have to travel a bit on Sundays, just a tip. Anyhow, the ferry was nice and clean. You passed the Harbour Bridge and the Opera House, and if you're going there in the late afternoon like my friend and I did then you'll have a gorgeous view with the sunset as backdrop, it's really pretty. The only downside with the ride to manly was getting on and off the ferry, there weren't any real queueing systems which ment that everyone was basically standing on top of each other. So if you've got claustrophobia I would recommend staying in the back, but that could mean that you won't get a seat. Also the ferry could have a few more outdoor seats. I'm pretty sure the roof-deck wasn't open because it's off season though. All in all, the trip was nice."

Well worth the trip... but if you want a bit of fun, then wait for inclement weather. The trip across the heads will be bumpy and exciting. With the right weather conditions, huge waves will splash across the bow and the bow & stern will dip and rise like a roller coaster. (Pray you don't get sea sick !!!)

It is occassionally cancelled in bad weather because it goes out near the Head of the Harbour where the wind and waves could get stronger. A quick way back is by the jet boat link if you prefer but you miss much of the views in and up coves, along the houses and bush reserves, the small boats and passing ferries of other lines. Sit inside or around the outside walkway on wooden benches, as I said, not luxury but part of the history of Sydney if not an original Ferry they carry with them the charm."

I love just sitting at the beach with a coffee/fish&chips/whatever and enjoying the sea and a little break from the hectic streets of Sydney central.

I sometimes have issues with seasickness. On the smaller vessel I was fine. We took the larger boat to the zoo the next day and I had issues with the wavy up and down feel of the boat and dock. The crowds of people and exhaust from the boat just made me feel more unsettled. The harbor is beautiful! You go past the Opera House. There are many sail boats out there. Very nice views of Sydney."

The opera house, the harbour bridge, the Sydney city and urban skyline, along with all the scenic spots on the harbour as well as the yachts and other boats on the water make this one of the best trips on a harbour or waterway anywhere in the world. Then when the ferry has arrived at Manly there is the pleasure of walking along the Corso to take in the scenery along the beautiful Manly beach with the line of Norfolk pines.I definitely recommend making the return journey by ferry as well in order to take in all the scenery from a different perspective."

The journey across the harbour offers many photo opportunities and you can walk around during the journey. Family friendly with snack bar and toilets on board. Walk through the Corso to Manly Beach lots of food options from fish and chips, pubs and boutique restaurants and bars. Recommend the walk from Manly Beach to Shelley Beach after lunch. Stroller friendly wide concrete path and pretty ocean views. Can be crowded in summer and on weekends so week days are best options to avoid crowds. If going swimming at Manly Beach swim in the patrolled areas. Rips (currents that take you out into the ocean) are a danger particularly to tourists who can be unaware of beach conditions. Stay safe and swim between the flags."

The spectacular, and changing views you will encounter will be worth a lot more than the price of the ticket. If you happen to go at peak hour, take to slow ferry, not the faster cats.

The ferries leave regularly from Circular Quay and the view you'll get on the way there can't be beaten. Obviously you won't have any commentary on what your seeing on the way but the cost is a fraction of the price you'll pay with the private tour operators. I recommend heading over mid afternoon, having a swim or stroll along manly beach, grabbing some dinner and catching an evening ferry back in the dark. There are some fabulous photo opportunities from the water as you head back into the city at night with the bridge and opera house all beautifully lit up. Tickets can be purchased at Circular Quay or you can travel on your day ticket or Opal card if you have one. Some of the ferries have a kiosk on board which sell snacks and drinks as well."

I was on a class excursion, travelling from Manly when two of my Muslim classmates that wear a hijab experienced harassment and islamophobic behavior from a passenger. As they got up from the seat, a woman began calling them \"muslim terrorists\" and swearing at them, humiliating them and making one of them cry. The captain of the ferry was informed of what happened, and fortunately the woman was kicked off the ferry. I would just like to thank the staff for making it such an enjoyable experience and for not tolerating such behaviour. With this day and age where racism and islamophobia is very common, I was very impressed with the way the situation was handled."

We used the Mnaly ferry a couple of time from Circular Quay 7 found the trip to be reasonably priced and being able to use your Opal card was we think a bit of a bonus, the only thing I would suggest is that you get down to the ferry quite early as it has a tendency to get very crowded as it is so popular. The whole trip across takes about 20 minutes I think as I didn't time it as I was too busy taking in the views around Sydney Harbour from looking back to the Bridge & Opera House as well as all the other wonderful views. If visitors do nothing else the ferry trip if only once is a must. Manly itself is well worth the visit as the beach is beautiful even if it can get a bit crowded sometimes."

The views of the Harbour are truly exceptional on the trip outward.The Manly quay is right in the heart and upon disembarkation everything is right in front of you and an excellent day can be passed there with its beautiful beach and myriad offers of food and beverages to suit all tastes.If you plan your return to Circular Quay to coincide with sunset you will be assured of the majestic nighttime views of Sydney Harbour,and of course Sydney Opera House and Harbour Bridge.I would not have missed the Manly Ferry for all the tea in China!"

In making that journey you get the best views of the Harbour Bridge, the Opera house, Government House in Kirribilli, all all the bays and reserves East of the Harbour Bridge. You also pass across the harbour heads, which depending upon the conditions in the open sea can be quite exciting, or slightly scary. But don't worry you are in safe hands.There is no commentary, though there are leaflets and you can easily find something to read or someone to ask, to inform yourself of the landmarks on your route.The journey takes about 35 minutes and at rush hour it can be crowded. In high seas you can get quite wet if you are out on deck. The cost is something like $8 each way. It does vary depending upon the ticket type you have. I used to get a 'Ferry Ten' where 10 single journeys cost $58, but now there are Opal cards you pay more per journey."

We got to the island and walked along the beach and walked the main street across the street. So many neat shops. We had a wonderful meal and headed back. It was dark ( A MUST) and the lights in Sydney Harbor made me vote Sydney Harbor the most beautiful city in the world. You have got to see the lights. The Sydney Harbor Bridge, Opera House and the farris wheel which has been there since the 30's where the solders would meet young girls....all added to the photo ops. No words can discribe this view. It was cold when we where there so take a jacket, mittens and a hat. We were freezing but the view was well worth it. You can go inside for warmth but it was worth the photos that I got. WOW....there is no words that can discribe this view. You must return after dark to take in this view of the lights in the harbor. Fabulous!!!"

The ferry runs very late so it can fit the schedule of travelers with limited time at a fraction of the price of a harbor tour."

There are lots of tourists on board trying to get photos especially on the trip back when you have a spectacular view of Sydney Harbor Bridge and the Sydney Opera House. You may have scoped out a perfect location up front from where you can take photos and just enjoy the peaceful ride over. Be prepared because your entire ride people aren't going to care you have the perfect seat. They want their photos and will stand directly in fron of you. Very poor manners but It doesn't take away from the beautiful ferry ride. Just be prepared for rudeness from tourists who believe they have a right to interrupt your view for theirs.

The ferries travel back and forward and they can hold a lot of people, very busy, we did not wait too long. Once there my relative who lives in Sydney took us to a waterside eating place. We sat outside in the glorious sunshine and had our lunch. Although there were eight of us we found a table and the food was very varied and of good quality, given the location my fish dish was very reasonable. On the ferry journey you get a great view of Sydney Harbour, it is really picturesque. The only complaint that I have is with a lady who was at the turnstile where you pay to get on the ferry. Our prepaid Opal card, which we had just purchased would not go into the machine. Bearing in mind we had been in Sydney a matter of a couple of hours, we travelled there from Melbourne. She was totally nasty and unhelpful. Five of our family had gone through and we were stranded, luckily my cousin who lives there ran and bought us another ticket."

The Manly Ferry return trip should tick the boxes if you are looking for some time viewing Sydney from the water, some sort of snack, take-away meal or sit down meal, a walk along one of Sydney's famous beaches, and a chance to see Sydney suburbia. The ferry trip is about 20-25 minutes and leaves Circular Quay regularly. It takes you all the way out to the Heads, which is the entrance to the harbour, and then swings into Manly Ferry Wharf. From there a walk through an outside mall with locals and tourists milling around ice-cream shops, surf and gift shops and local pubs, leads you to the beach. Along the beachfront are more shops and restaurants, but head down to the sand and a dip in the water or a walk. A few blocks back from the busy mall and shopping areas are streets and streets of Sydney suburbia. It's worth taking a stroll around to check out the everyday action of local people doing their thing. Manly has some other activities as well so you could make a very long day of the visit if you wished. Ferries leave for the city regularly so nothing is too stressy in Manly."

If anything exemplified the image of this young country, this was surely it. It was much smaller than I had imagined but, worse, it was cold and raining. Like a normanl Bank Holiday in Britain really. I expected to see men and women flaunting their six-packs; instead all I saw was men and women sporting their pack-a-macs! Just my bad luck especially as the weather improved greatly only a few hours later. I imagine on a hot, sunny day, it's a great place to spend time although I doubt if I would venture into the water. Sorry, Sydney, would love to give Bondi Beach a glowing review but, on my visit, it was as bright as a Toc H lamp!"

For your first time in Sydney, this may be the better ( if more expensive) option because of the background information you will be getting. But if you have that information already, take the return trip to Manly by ferry. It takes you almost all the way out to the North Head and lets you enjoy the views along the way. Moreover, you can spend a leisurely time in Manly, walking the boulevard or the beach and resting at one of the many bars and restaurants. Nothing really exquisite, but a way to enjoy Sydney as the Australians do."

And here we were with our sunscreen and hats! Funny how many great hats are for sale and none of the locals like to wear them- only the tourists I guess.

This is a commuter ferry that takes riders from the Circular Quay to Manly and back. The bonus for the traveler is that the views of Sydney are first rate and beach that you can explore in Manly is a short walk from the ferry landing. You go from Sydney hubbub to Jones Beach, complete with a short boardwalk with beach stores Australian style, in 30 minutes. Don't miss the Movenpick ice cream store on the Curso-pedestrian mall to the beach. If you are an ice cream lover, this ice cream is heavenly and not available in USA. Super rich and yummy! Expensive, but worth it! Loved Swiss Chocolate. Also, we didn't have the time, but there is a lovely walk from Manly beach that I would have liked to have taken."

It was a pleasant way to spend 30 minutes although there didn't seem to be a great deal in Manly, just a lovely beach and a variety of food places. Great that the tourist shops sell sweatshirts for $10 because it turned really chilly and poured with rain and that ferry ride can be a little chilly too so we bought a couple of sweatshirts for the way back and grabbed a coffee in a great place called Ground Zero whilst we waited for the rain to stop. Worth the trip for the views from the water and maybe a bit of lunch out."

There really is nothing as beautiful as Sydney Harbour when she is basked in sun with a slight breeze blowing. Sadly my issue with the trip is the lack of consideration by some of the other ferry goers. I understand that everyone needs that photo with the Opera House and Harbour Bridge in the background but when it's done move away so that everyone else can see as well. There's always the rush of herded cattle to just get that best spot but people need to be aware of those around them and it's not uncommon for a bit of pushing and manoeuvring to put a dampener on the ride. Nevertheless whether you're a local or a visitor a ferry trip on the harbour is simply a must."

The Manly ferry which takes 30 minutes to travel each way between Sydney Circular Quay and Manly is a fantastic way to experience the views of Sydney Harbour from the Sydney Harbour bridge to the heads that guard the ocean entrance, You can see the most magnificent harbour in the world. The ferry cruise also provides an opportunity to check out the seaside suburb of Manly. It's an inexpensive way to see the harbour and your ticket can also be used for unlimited travel on Sydney ferries, trains and buses during the same day."

This is one of the larger ferries plying its trade Cossack the Harbour from Circular Quay to Manley and its fabulous beach.Generally a very scenic ride, but beware! the route does go across the Head of the Harbour and is subject to quite large swells at times. If you are a bad sailor best check the water conditions before taking the trip."

It costs only $15 or so to ride to Manly Beach and back from Sydney's Circular Quay, and though I wouldn't call it a luxury ride, it's plenty comfortable and affords spectacular views for a fraction of what you'll pay for most harbor cruises. We took fabulous pictures of the Opera House and the bridge on our rides (went more than once) and then just relaxed for the half hour it takes to get to Manly (well worth seeing, by the way--gorgeous beach). Sit outside if you can--you need to be at the front of the line at boarding to get one of these coveted seats. You'll love the fresh air and you'll see a lot more than if you sit inside. Inside seats do not afford the same views, but they're very comfortable. Seasoned riders sit here and use their phones (yes, they offer wifi) or read a book. As first-timers, though, we definitely wanted to soak in the outside views. Ferries run regularly, every half hour or so all day, so there's no set schedule; you can come and go as you please. Manly Beach is very interesting to visit. You can spend time on the beach itself or poke around through the many little shops and restaurants or coffee houses. Be sure to do this at least once when you visit Sydney! I should also mention that of all the ferry rides available, the one to Manly Beach is among the longest, so you get more time on the waves than you would going to other destinations."

Having bought a ticket well in advance, we had a wander round the harbour area and joined a queue next to the ticket kiosk. When we arrived at the gate some 15 minutes later, we were told that the tickets were for another Manly Ferry and to go to a different dock. Same story, although a shorter queue and after a third failed attempt we were directed to another jetty some 200m from the ticket kiosk. Needless to say our ferry had long gone and we had to wait another 40 minutes for the next one. In retrospect all the Manly ferries had slightly different names but all including the words Manly and Ferry. The ferry journey itself was excellent, slightly quicker than the regular service and provided a good trip around the harbour. We did make sure that we went to the right jetty for the return journey to Darling Harbour and we ended up being pleased that we had made the journey to Manly!"

We did it as it was sunset, the view is really nice of the city and nice photos along the way :)We arrived at Manly by now it was dark and for us there was not so much to do, basically we walked along the beach and then back into the ferry terminal.In the Manly ferry terminal there was a great sweet shop bang in the middle you can't miss it which was nice :)Returning there was not so much to see until you got closer to Sydney and then it's the city of lights!When we did it, it was not summer. My idea was to sit on the outside at the very front of the ferry and see the view from there along the way. However it just got way to windy and cold and we went inside. The view from there is not as good.I would love to try this again on a hot day in summer, possibly go early in the day and spend more time in the beach.For the day I went, I would give it 6/10!"

Check out the info on the web for NSW travel.The Manly ferry trip itself is 30 minutes each way and there are great views all the way. Of course if you want to visit Manly Beach then the ferry is a great way to get there (it's very high capacity although I assume it gets very busy at peak times). But it's also a good option to simply take the trip over, have a quick stroll and a drink, and come back.

We're visitors so don't have an Opal card; it cost us $30.40 for 2 return tickets. But a pleasant 30 minute trip. Many people chose to sit outside, but we found a nice seat near the front next to a window and had a great view of the harbour - sit facing the front leaving Manly or towards the back if leaving Circular Quay for the harbour view. The ferry has a cafe on board and toilets. At the Manly end there's a great market atmosphere with a few little shops. The only downside is finding somewhere to park at the Manly end. There is parking under the ferry terminal but it's limited and expensive, nearly $60 for 4 hrs."

You can sit on deck and enjoy the salty air and sunshine or around the sides and get s good dose of sea spray when the water is choppy or else on comfortable seats inside, protected from the elements. Nice views for the whole trip and love it when you pass the heads and its gets a bit rocky."

Both the harbour side and the ocean side which is reached by walking through the bustling Corso have plenty of great views and lots of fabulous eateries. Once on the ocean side, if you don't want to experience the surf, take the ocean walk around to Shelly Beach. Look out for the water dragons sunning themselves along the walk and the delightful little sculptures as you reach Shelly Beach. If you're in luck it could be a windy day with a good swell which makes of high seas funs as the ferry passes past the heads."

And the Manly ferry is probably the most iconic. The trip from Circular Quay to Many takes around 30 minutes, plenty of seating inside and some outside as well as standing room. Lots of window space so good views from inside and upper and lower decks. Ferries can get crowded at peak times (public holidays, Christmas, N Year) but boarding/disembarking is well organised and runs smoothly. Plenty to see on the Harbour (fortress and naval) and of course the Bridge and Opera House so bring your camera. Can get a bit windy. The Harbour really is the jewel in Sydney's crown so if you went to Manly mid/late afternoon and returned after dark you would get the best of both worlds. Numerous fares available but one way is around $8 and purchased from a booth a short distance from actual departure point so don't go directly to where the ferry leaves from or you will have to back track."

There are many fine eating places on the Manly pier. My wife and I adore the share plates of guacamole, empanades and smoky pork, lamb and beef platters at Papi Chulo (book ahead) while taking in the view of the water and passers by.

This ride was suggested by several friends when they heard we were having a short visit to Sydney and my response was that this was a city break and there would be no time to go to the beach. However, we were in need of a rest and could sit down on the ferry and continue to sightsee. With an Opal card the maximum fare on public transport over the course of a day is $15 so we decided to take advantage of what was in effect a free ride. The Manly ferry a great way to see the lower reaches of Sydney Harbour and the destination is a nice seaside town with a sandy beach. The journey gets a bit choppy as the ferry crosses the mouth of the harbour; you will know when to expect it by watching a ferry coming in the opposite direction."

It is regular and efficient, a great 'ride' in inclement weather and a relaxing ride the rest of the time. Why bother paying a fortune for a fancy harbour tour, for a few dollars you can get the best tour of the harbour and on public transport. You can catch the ferry from Circular Quay, ride starboard to Manly and return on the portside and you'll get the best possible views of the Harbour Bridge, the CBD, Taronga Zoo, the Eastern suburbs, Fort Denison, Garden Island, the Sydney Heads and of course Manly. Stay on the ferry and it will take you back to the Quay or hop off at Manly, check out the shopping, the beach and the headland and catch the next ferry back. I've lived away from Sydney for decades and when I return this is always the best way to reacquaint oneself with how beautiful Sydney really is."

You'll be paying a hell of a lot more through a tour company to see these sites up close.The dock in Manly is perfect as well with shops and restaurants within the walk through and Manly beach being opposite."

The day was very hot but on the water the breeze kept things at a much more comfortable level. The ferry was clean and well maintained and of course the scenery could not be surpassed. What a beautiful harbour with such iconic landmarks as the Sydney Harbour Bridge, Opera House, Fort Denison etc. If you have an Opal Card the trip on a Sunday is capped at $2.50 (and that includes Sydney ferries, buses, trains, light rail etc). If you have children you can get Family Fun Day tickets on Sundays if you don't have Opal for the same pricing. Kids love the ferry!"

From the hush around Chiwder bay to the working harbour hit boats coming in through the heads there is always something to se.For tourists this is where you get your killer shot of you with the opera house and harbour bridge behind you. Sit upstairs out the front in the front row to ensure your moment.For the rest of the trio just enjoy the beauty.If you need food very basic tasty junk food is available - lurid coloured doughnuts, toasted sandwiches and pies and sausage rolls.

Pick a day that has a smallish swell, and hopefully a bit of sun to enjoy. If there has recently been a strong storm front, the swell can get big near the heads so unless you want extra motion in your crossing, avoid heavy swells.Check out beachsafe.org.au to check the weather and conditions. On the Manly side you can explore the Corso shops and walk to Manly beach. If that is too touristy or busy for you, try Little Manly Cove that is only 1 km from the wharf.

Regular, on time departures and taking 30 minutes each way, you are dropped at Circular Quay in central Sydney. A fabulous view awaits when rounding the headland after leaving Manley, as the majestic Sydney Harbour Bridge and Opera House sweep into view. These iconic landmarks really are best appreciated from the water. If you can board early and head to the front of the vessel so that you can get a prime outdoor seat, then you will get the most from the trip. Adult return ticket is $15 (AUS), so probably about the cheapest way to get into central Sydney. "

With the pass, it's free for any ferry, train, bus etc. We went to the Manly ferry twice - in an evening and an afternoon. The time we went in the evening, it was very windy and quite chilly. We went another time in an afternoon and it was nice and calm. We could see the opera house at different angles. It was just relaxing and definitely worth a try.At Manly, we spent 30 mins walking along the street to see the stores then hop back to the next one.The ferry runs every 30 mins is equipped with washroom. If you have time, you should try the ferry from Circular Quay to Balmain too. The ferry stops at different places (Darling Harbour, Luna Park etc)and you can see the harbour even more."

Ours was a Sunday trip and yes, the ferry does get busy, especially after 9am when the main tourist crowd wakes up. We were on a 10am one and much as it was busy everyone had a seat and there were some empties, as far as I could see. The ferry has two decks, both with large \"inside\" seating areas, \"outside\" area on the lower deck is standing room only, but the top deck one has benches. There is no organised queue system so when the ferry is ready for boarding there can be a bit of a stampede, but everybody gets on board. If you are after the Sydney Harbour views and photos of the Opera House & the Bridge, you've got to bag a spot on the top deck outside. Be prepared to jostle with other photographers for a good shot - I wasn't and suddenly everybody was up and the small area got very busy. The ferry goes right past the Opera House almost immediately after it leaves the dock. Later there are some spectacular harbour views with the bridge right in front of you.The journey is a quick 30 min and on a quiet sunny day it was an excellent experience - short enough not to get bored (essential for those with young kids :-), but long enough to enjoy the fact that you are sailing, it presented some great photo opportunities and was very inexpensive.We travelled on a Sunday Family day pass - $2.50 per person covers a full day of unlimited travel on Sydney train/bus/ferry, which worked well for our party of five."

The Manly Ferry to and from Circular Quay is first and foremost a means of daily commuting for Sydney workers and families, however the great thing for tourists is that it provides unsurpassed views of Sydney Harbour, northern shores and the iconic Bridge and Opera House. The classic design of Manly Ferry is easily identifiable as it wends its way in and out of the harbour. On board you do get some 'open water' swell outside of the Heads, but generally it is a reasonably calm trip - of course this will be weather dependent. Cost for a return trip to Manly is a reasonable $14.80, and much cheaper if you are eligible for a seniors discount. Returning from Manly early on a Saturday night, it was interesting to see the number of young, 'dolled-up' Manly locals travelling over to Sydney for a 'night on the town'. Our night views of the Harbour Bridge, the Opera House and city skyline were a tourist's delight, but didn't seem to have much attraction for the locals who were not going to be distracted from their conversations. We did The Spit to Manly Scenic Walk and saw several of the ferries from the clifftops as they moved in a out of the Heads."

This is probably the most economical and relaxing trip you can do while visiting Sydney, it's a very pleasant ride on the harbour long enough to see the foreshore with it's multi million dollar homes and historical sites like Fort Dennison and Kirribilli House, but not too long that the kids will get bored. They run from Circular Quay to Manly wharf ever 5-10 minutes and it's a leisurely 30 minute ride that goes past the Opera House and offers great views of the city and the great Harbour Bridge. Lots of terrific photo ops, you see all the lovely hidden bays and beaches along the leafy north shore. At Manly you are able to wander the shops & caf\u00e9s, walk to the world class beach. (Named by Captain Cook in the late 1700's after seeing the very masculine, manly indigenous people along the beach), or do the Manly to Spit Bridge Coastal Walk."

Sailing past The Heads(where it can be a little choppy) and into Manly Wharf.The journey takes 30 minutes and the ferry always leaves dead on time. From Manly Wharf it is a short walk to Manly Corso and a lovely long sandy beach.The ferry has two decks,most of the seating being indoors, but there are outside areas too for people wanting to see the Sydney skyline as they come into Circular Quay and take photos."

Yesterday I found that here in Sydney that\u2019s not the case, I left my wallet on the 7:40am Manly Ferry from Circular Quay, I didn't realise that I had done it and it was only at 1pm when I tried to buy lunch that I have the sinking feeling that it had gone.

Manly Ferries are historic but modern, cosy but fresh, exciting but conservative and very, very safe.The trip from Sydney's Circular Quay, or vice versa - Manly to Sydney, is one of the most beautiful, charming, and important items on your sight seeing agenda. Whether you're a local or a tourist, you MUST do the Manly Ferries.It's easy to buy a ticket - Opal cards are just coming in now, and various day cards, week cards etc are also available. The ticket operators are so easy to communicate with and very helpful if you explain what you might need, to get the best deal.Make sure you give youself time - ferries go every half hour in the mornings and evenings and also during the day (not sure the times.) It's easy to look these things up online.The trip is around 35 mins one way. From the Sydney end you can find the right pier by looking at the signs above the entrances. Find a great seat next to a window, near the front, or up the back. You can also go outside, but the view from inside is so spectacular, don't stress if you don't get one.If you're a tourist stay on the eastern side of the ferry - that is the one pointing towards the operahouse. If you're a local - go on the otherside, you'll be amazed at the gorgeous sandstone cliffs and bush.Before you take off look at North Sydney! it's almost as big as central Sydney for business, and contains the historic Luna Park on the foreshores. Notice also the gorgeous small ferries and other vessels in service, the little Alexander, Charlotte, and super Dawn Fraser...wonderful vessels travelling up Sydney's beautiful waterways, the Parramatta River etc.If you're taking pictures, take them out of an open window or from the deck around the sides. No good pictures can be taken through glass.On the way, note the Opera House, the Harbour Bridge, the beautiful historic rocks area to the western side of the quay. (convict built).ON your way out on the starboard side notice the elite Eastern Suburbs of Sydney with the beautiful mansions and lovely views. Note Fort Denison, and the lovely little bays and yachts.On the port side you can see Kirribilli House, and the lovely Northern Suburb bays of Mosman etc. You'll see beautiful, old gold, Sydney Sandstone - the rock which built Sydney! The golden colour of Sydney Sandstone and the pink of the Hawksbury sandstone is something you;ll see resounding in the buildings around the area.Look and relax while watching the yachts, other ferries, seagulls, and keep an eye out for whales!!! During the winter seasons you might see a spurt out to sea!Towards the heads you'll find the water gets a little rougher - rarely unbearable, sometimes a gentle rock, sometimes a fun roller coaster - these ferries are sturdy, safe and have Masters at the wheel who know these waters like their own front yard....you're safe. Whenever the swell is too dangerous the ferries stop. Simple as that.North Head is the large headland poking out from north to south. It contained the old Quarantine station - people travelling in ships had to stop there if there was anything nasty aboard.!The lookout from the National Park on North Head is one of the most astounding in the world. Take a taxi to the top, a bike (you can hire them in Manly if you've got the fortitude to ride) or walk. A walk up the hill should take about an hour. A car trip only 5-7 mins. It's astonishing, jawdroppingly beautiful, and a scene that famous painters like Arthur Streeton relished.As you head toward Manly you'll see the lovley bushland, gold sandstone cliffs, and seaside living that IS the Northern Beaches. Watercraft, restaurants, bungalows set in the bushland, high units with wonderful views...and beaches, some secluded, some frantic. Soak it all in, it doesn't matter which side of the ferry you're on. Manly is a treat for the senses.You can eat Manly, drink Manly, soak up Manly, feel Manly, walk Manly, even buy some of Manly...from the foreshores of Manly Harbour to the west and it's gorgeous still beach, bars and wharf life, to the incomparible Manly Beach to the east. You'll just love it. The Manly Corso joins the two areas like an artery of life - buzzing with people, souvenirs, business and restaurants. Too Touristy?? Get a life. THIS is the life. Manly Ferries is one of the BEST things you can do in Sydney. (oh...and to top it off, why don't you catch the little ferry around to Mosman, and go to the Taronga Park Zoo....WHAT a day!!!)"

Make a day trip and eat at one of the many fish restaurants in Manly - The Fish Cafe up the road is great. We also love Hugos on the wharf for the most spectacular pizza, salads and they are famous for cocktails- even non-alcoholic ones for us. We usually grab ice-cream at Movenpick, but there are about 5 great ice-cream shops that I can think of in a short walking distance of the Ferry. Hmm makes me want ice-cream now. There are many surf shops and cute little stores in the \"village centre\". Walking around Manly, eating ice-cream, lazing on the beach in the sea breeze (all year- but rugged up in winter) and then returning to the city on the Ferry is just a great day trip as a couple or for a family."

As we all know, the trip to Manly Beach crosses one of the most beautiful harbours in the world, Sydney Harbour.For years I have traveled this waterway by public transoprt, or to use it's better known name the Manly Ferry.Multi milliojn dollar views for only a few dollars. Mostly the trip is fairly calm and sedate, but on some occasions the Manly Ferry makes some of the scenes in Noah look like a walk in the park. It can get extremely rough.Some people like this, and only travel to Manly during the worst weather conditions.The boarding process is easy and quick, and as the larger ferries do not turn around, head straight for the pointy end furthest from the dock for a great view during the trip.You can buy multi trip tickets, Zoo tickets, all day tickets, and go on as many ferry trips as possible. I also highly recoment the ferry trip to darling harbour & Balmain.The larger ferries have food and drink available at reasonable prices.A great trip for the day is:Take River Cat from the wharf at Parramatta to Circular Quay, then jump on the Manly ferry, have lunch at one of the MANY eateries in Manly, then reverse the process. Just be mindful of the final ferry times for the Parramatta River Cat. The Manly ferry works till late, so even a nice romantic monnlight cruise is available."

It's a relatively quick way of seeing (and photographing) some of Sydney harbour's famous landmarks. From the skyscrapers beyond Circular Quay, the harbour bridge, Opera House, Botanical Gardens, the exclusive waterfront residences on the foreshores of Double bay, Rose Bay and Watsons Bay. Before long you're passing the mouth of the harbour, South Head and North Head. This is my favourite part of the journey, especially during stormy conditions - it can be a bit of a 'roller coaster' ride, something i have always enjoyed - but it may not be for the faint hearted. It only lasts a few minutes. Not long after you arrive at Manly - some 35 minutes later. The return trip is just as interesting, as you pass the mouth to Middle Harbour, with Balmoral Beach in the distance. At Middle Head we see the start of Sydney Harbour National Park, then we round Bradley's Head, most noticeable item of interest is The foremast of the cruiser HMAS Sydney, Australian vessel from WW1. The harbour side entrance to Taronga Park Zoo is then visible through the bushes on the right. Another quick view of Harbourside real estate, Fort Denison on the left and finally returning to Circular Quay. Summer months are the high season for cruise ships which dock on the western side of the Quay at the Internation Overseas Terminal. So ends a round trip with the Manly ferry. Please note: there are many attractions at Manly as well, no need to stay on the ferry. Ideal in summer, and Sydney's balmy winters."

Purchase the $2.50 pension excursion ticket, hope a bus or train to circular quay,then the Manly ferry over to Manly, a short stroll through the mall to the beach, then back again, take your pick of any other ferries, always doing the round trip, make the last one of the day, the fast cat to Watsons Bay, if you get there before 4pm you are still in time for lunch at Doyles. Bus to Bondi Junction, via Bondi Beach. Bus or train back to where you are staying. This is a truly fantastic day on the harbour and all for $2.50"

Our magic harbour, the historic ferries and iconic Manly beach are a perfect mix. Time it right and you can return to see the sun setting over the Sydney Harbour Bridge. The ferries are large and you can sit inside or enjoy the views from the deck. It can be a very inexpensive day out for the whole family or a lovely day out for couples. Highly recommended."

Ittakes about half an hour, and the views and experienceis worth every penny. Manley is a pleasant resort with a very goog beach and good promenade for walking. Nice pubs and eateries, lots of shops to explore.a few hours in Manley will fly by. The return journey will offer good photo oportunities of the bridge and opera house , perhaps the most iconic aussie picture you are likely to take, and i can see why Australians are stating they have the most picturesque harbour in the world, but personally I think the picure of the Hudson bridge with Manhattan as the backdrop is just as iconic and far more dramatic."

There really should be an insistence on all passengers staying seated. You might want to have a fleece/cardie handy.

As an older life-time Sydney resident, I've used the Manly ferry 'for pleasure' once or twice a year for more than 60 years, and never tire of it. Now, I usually take grandchildren, and share their discovery of the harbour. Ferries leave Circular Quay every half an hour and take almost half an hour to reach Manly. Every part of Sydney Harbour and its water traffic is interesting.I'd suggest tourists walk around Manly for an hour or more, and in summer you can swim either at the surf beach or a quieter harbour beach adjacent to the ferry wharf. There is a very pleasant walk on a good path starting at the Southern end of the beach, to another sheltered small beach - 'Fairy Bower', less than an hour for the return journey. There are plenty of places to eat. The best 'takeaway' fish and chip shops are close to the beach. There is a good fish restaurant, 'Garfish', close to the ferry wharf. Sydney Ferries was government-owned and operated until a few years ago. Now privately owned, there are signs of cost-cutting e.g. on my recent use of the ferry, there were long queues for tickets, so that arriving 10 minutes before departure wasn't enough time to get that ferry. Most of my previous experiences, though, would rate '5 out of 5'."

This beach is the only west-facing beach on Australia's East coast and for snorkelers and divers the protected Cabbage Tree Bay is filled with unique marine life such as the Eastern Blue Groper, the Weedy Sea dragon, Gloomy Octopus, and Little Penguin. For the more energetic a walk up hill to North Head - via North Fort - provides fantastic cliff top views back to the city.

Costs about $6.00 one way, The trip takes you past the iconic Opera House and provides plenty of time for photos of the Sydney harbor bridge and takes you across our scenic harbor to Manly. There you can take a short walk and stop into many souvenir and surf shops, banks, and pubs, and make your way to the beautiful surf beach of Manly. Before taking your return trip to Circular quay you can stop off at Manly Wharf bar and have a cold beverage before heading back. The ferry has a snack bar on board, and you can sit back, inside or outside and enjoy your trip back."

It took 30 minutes to make the trip from Circular Quay to Manly and the ferry passed by the Sydney Opera house going and coming and afforded an opportunity for some excellent picture taking of not only the Opera House but also the Sydney Harbour Bridge and the skyline of Sydney. The weather was warm and sunny when I took the ferry. Had the weather been poor, this may have been a different experience. The one negative about the ferry boat was that it did not have very much on-deck seating. Most of the seating was indoors. A must do activity when in Sydney."

Perhaps less known is that you can buy an all-day pass which allows you to spend all day taking in the different routes that ply their trade across the harbour.

Don't think downstairs outside had seating, but I'm not sure. If you're at the front of the boat on the way over, you'll be at the back on the return trip as they don't turn around. The trip is about 1/2 an hour each way and can get a little rough as you pass the area open to the sea.

Everyone knows about Bondi being the best beach but it is a must for visitors to visit Manly.The ferry ride from Circular Quay to Manly is very picturesque and takes about 30minutes andmany beautiful photos can be taken from the ferry including Sydney Harbour Bridge, the Opera House and the foreshore of Sydney. Once in Manly, an easy stroll up the Corso will take you to the ocean side which is also beautiful. From Manly you can catch a bus to Palm Beach which follows the coast line and from Palm Beach you can make your way back to Sydney via the Harbour Bridge by bus. This is my pick between the two beaches. Maybe not for young children if you intend to do the whole trip, but if you are only going to Manly they will enjoy the beach."

My ticket was 14.40 round trip and the ferry runs every 30 minutes. Once there, you can enjoy the beach and shops. My purpose was to see the harbor, not manly so I stayed on the ferry and rode it back to circular quay. They do have a fast ferry, but take the slow one so you can enjoy the breathtaking views. This is a must do in Sydney."

My only suggestion is to avoid the peak hours during the week, and the early and late ferries on the Weekend, so you do not need to queue so much. The fares are on the expensive side, but if you are a senior or pensioner it only costs $2.50, and on Sundays, the excursion fare is very reasonable, as is a family fare as long as you have a child travelling with you as it includes all other public transport within a fair distance. I love the ambience of the ferry, and how the tourists are all entranced with the views. It makes us locals try to appreciate how wonderful the whole journey really is."

You can buy a day pass for $22 (children half price) that allows you travel on any bus, train or ferry all day with the one ticket or you can buy a one-off ticket for around $15 return. Not advisable to take the ferry on a day when the water is rough though as you have to cross the Heads and it can get quite scary. Even a large swell can upset you if you're not a particularly good sailor. Plenty to see and do when you arrive. Highly recommended for all visitors to Sydney."

Catch the ferry to Manly in the mid morning, have lunch in Manly stroll along the beach, paddle or go for a surf and return to the City by Ferry in the afternoon.

If you only visit one beach in Sydney, make it Manly not Bondi and do it by ferry.Unlike Bondi, which is essentially a huge car park with a beach, Manly is a classic Australian beach with a panoramic sweep and tall Norfolk Island Pines.Best, getting to Manly is a treat enjoyed over and over again by Sydneysiders. Both the ocean and harbour beaches are worth a visit but my favourite is to walk around to Shelly Beach which is always calm and, because it is a marine sanctuary, a great place for snorkelling. The walk up to North Head is great if you have time and energy. It starts at the end of Shelly Beach and leads through Sydney coastal heath that puts on a beautiful spread in spring with wild flowers. You might also see whales from the cliffs during their migration (June and July)."

(Trips cease on really rough weather mainly as the swell at Manly Wharf gets too much for the mooring lines) There's usually coffee and snacks available and crew willing to explain the many points of interest around the harbour, but do not distract them whilst mooring (Tying up) and unmooring. My first experiences were as a ferry deckhand in 1996 and later as Sydney retiree tourist on visits from my rural home."

The first thing we do when we have friends or associates visit us from overseas or interstate is take them on cruise on the Manly Ferry.On a beautiful sunny day in Sydney the Harbour is spectacular and there is no better way of seeing it than on the water from a ferry. The beauty of the Manly Ferry is you get to see most of the Harbour and at the end of your trip you can walk to Manly Beach which is about 450 metres from the wharf. Make sure you get an ice cream or fish and chips on your stroll to the beach where you can sit on the sea wall or on the sand and enjoy the surf and people watch. If you are up to it turn right and follow the sea wall around to Shelly Beach, about 1 kilometre. The walk is spectacular. This beach is sheltered from the surf and if you have young children they will be able to have a swim. After all this you get to do it all in reverse on your journey back to Circular Quay.

The trip to the city in the morning is much more pleasant than return trip with hordes of tourists. Going between North and South Head can be fun or sickening depending on how you stomach the swell (the ferry does close in big swell and/or bad weather). Beautiful vistas coming into the city and past the Opera House, Fort Denison and The Bridge, keep your camera out. All in all, a nice family morning out."

The rest of the children were free. You ge magnificent views of the harbour bridge and the opera house from this vantage and Manly is such a great way to spend the day, with the Sea Life Centre and the pubs and cafes offering cheap meals, and don't forget the popular Manly beach. We found the ferry clean if not a bit dated, but was fit for our purposes."

This is the best way to see Sydney Harbour as it takes you down the harbour and compared to the tours available it is the cheapest way to see the harbour. Best time to use the service is outside peak time 7.00am to 9.30am and 3.00pm to 6.30pm that way you will be able to either get an outside view or a good seat inside.On a good day it is a good trip or if the swell is running from the heads you get a roller coaster ride."

It is about a half hour trip across Sydney Harbour. The day we went was awesome. Blue skies, gentle swell. This ferry is very comfortable for public transport, and provides one of the best views of the Opera House, as you pass by it quite close. You get a feel of adventure as you cross The Heads just before arriving at he Manly Jetty. There are a number of cafes and restaurants at Manly, but you must check out Hugos for the best pizzas! We found a quaint market was running on the Sunday we went. Manly has a holiday feel about it, yet just a short trip from the city. Next time we might stay at Manly to enjoy the relaxed feel of the place. Ferries run each half hour for most of the day, so you can take as long or short a time to explore as you like."

Unfortunately the experience was marred a little by how extremely crowded it was. We came during school holidays so maybe out of season is better. Worst of all was the attitude of one of the crew, a hairy young man who did nothing but show disdain for the passengers. As I say it was crowded and it was difficult for us to move. The crew member gave no clear direction rather than grunt and curse how we were in his way both on departing and arrival. We chose to return to the city by bus where the staff were polite and friendly."

The ferry itself is not wildly comfortable but adequate. We preferred not to sit inside but to take one of the outside seats so that we could take in the view. The trip to Manly takes about half an hour. Most of the trip was very calm, but crossing Sydney Heads just before reaching Manly was quite rocky. It was a fascinating trip. Limited refreshments were available on board. Booking clerks and other staff on board were not particularly friendly but it is one of the top things to do in Sydney - I will definitely go back, and have no hesitation in recommending it."

You pass close to the Sydney Opera House and proceed into the harbor, even with a view of the mouth of the harbor where you can see the open ocean. It is a very scenic ride and you pass other sailboats and pull into Manly. We arrived at sunset when the sky was a blazing orange color and the docked sailboats with the oceanfront homes was a picturesque view. I was as if you were placed in a painting canvas at an art museum. (see the attached photos) You can disembark and walk the beachfront shops and have great seafood and gelato. We returned to Circular Quay at night and it was a whole new experience. The brightly lit up Sydney skyline was the backdrop to a black ocean. The ambient sound of the bow tearing through the waves is a very calming effect. As you near Circular Quay, you can see the Opera House lit up in all its glory from a unique vantage point different from that on the ground. The magnificently lit up Sydney Harbor Bridge can also be seen as a backdrop to the Sydney Opera House. Be sure to sit at the bow of the ship for a perfect view. It does get pretty windy so bundle up, especially on a chilly day/night. Another tip to keep in mind is that the demand for this ferry is quite high so there may be long lines to board the vessel. Don't miss this experience and it was definitely one of the highlights of my trip. If I lived here, I would do this every weekend"

Being born and bred in Sydney, and having travelled abroad, I find it very difficult not to be biased about my review of Manly. I just love the trip to Manly on the Manly ferry. It's just a fantastic way to see our harbour landmarks and beautiful surrounds. If you want to save some money on transport you may want to consider purchasing an all day pass which includes bus, train and ferry rides. The ferry trip takes about a half an hour from Circular Quay to Manly. They are frequent but mostly crowded on the weekends, but you can normally manage to get a seat inside or out. Make sure you bring your camera as you will inevitably get some great shots of the Sydney Harbour Bridge, Opera House, garden Island and Fort Dennison.Once at Manly take a stroll past the shops down to the beach, lots of coffee shops and eateries all reasonably priced. If you have purchased an all day fare excursion maybe consider jumping on a bus (they leave from a bustop near the jetty) and take a trip to the northern beaches.I promise you that you will have a terrific day...so much fun and lots of fun too. Pubs sell boutique beers if you are game :)"

Its quaint and relaxing and an excellent way to view the city, This was always my number one recommendation to visitors. The central business district is relatively small and can be walked around in a couple of hours. The Queen Victoria Building containing boutique shops and a couple of department stores are about all that is available. Otherwise Sydney is much the same as any other city. A trip to the zoo by ferry is worthwhile and there are two art galleries, a natural history museum and the Powerhouse museum are worthwhile visiting. The train service offers a trip to Katoomba in the Blue Mountains and to Kiama on the south coast. Both take a couple of hours and are a good way to see Australia. Chinatown for Asian food, Norton Street Leichhardt for Italian. Hope this helps."

You will see Goat and Clarke islands, Pinchgut (Fort Denison) Kirribilli House, and enjoy a close-up view of the Opera House and the Harbour Bridge. Do this on a sunny day or in the late afternoon when the sun is setting and you will see the best part of the harbour and you will not be disappointed.

When you arrive at Manly walk down The Corso (a bit tacky) to the surf beach and even turn right and walk around to Shelley Beach if you want a long day's walk.Apply the sunscreen before you leave and wear a hat as the sun in Australia is fierce (unlike Europe).Of course, sit on one side of the ferry (outside) on the way there and see the other shore on the way back. Keep in mind that the westerly sun hits you all the way back in the afternoon if you sit on the right hand side. You can of course change position when travelling if you want.If you go when there is a big swell (big waves) when the ferry crosses the harbour entrance it is quite fun when the ferry goes up and down over that short stretch."

There are some expensive restaurants around, especially if you want one with a water view, but walk around and you can find well priced places. The shops in the corso are a little disappointing being mainly take away food places and shops with cheap tourist 'stuff', but look around and there is some quality places.

Having spent a large part of my early life on the northern beaches, I have found myself travelling on the Manly Ferry many times. There have been poems written about the ferry ride (5 Bells) and there have been a range of different types of ferry over the years. I especially liked the old steamers that used to plough the water in the 50s, 60s and 70s until they were decommissioned. These hulking ships hailed from Scotland and were made of sturdy stuff. The best part of any journey would be traversing 'the Heads'. If it was rough then the water would break over the boughs and people on the lower decks would have to lift up their feet to avoid all the water slushing around. Today the ferries are more sleek and modern. They are also faster. This is a good feature for commuters who are in a hurry but it does detract from the 35 to 40 minute journeys of past years, when travellers could take in the view of the harbour at a leisurely pace. The journey though, is just as wonderful and over the years the secret came out that this is a wonderful trip to take if you are a tourist, as well as a local. Manly Wharf is an interesting place to visit as is Manly Beach. All the ferries on the harbour are a wonderful way to spend some time without spending a great deal of money. The Manly Ferry is the best."

Easy to find where to go from and most people will be helpful. It costs a few dollars and is vastly cheaper and better than the commercial alternatives. When you get there head down to the ocean side and walk south on the beach side of South Styene. You can head all the way round to Shelly beach which is a delightful stop for coffee or a swim. On you way back stop at Wentworth Street just a few shops up from South Styene and you can buy freshly grilled fish with chips in a take-away container to eat on the tables by the foreshore. A splendid way to have a meal and not at all expensive; well not by the usual Sydney standards anyway. If you come to Sydney don't miss the Manly ferry!"

Once in Manly, you can walk direct to the beach (takes 5 minutes) and enjoy a day on the beach, visit shops go to the Manly Acquarium, eat at great restaurants and return with the ferry back to Sydney.

There is an entire block of shopping along the way, including a coup,e of very nice Aborigines art galleries. Definitely another worthwhile trip."

We usually go for a walk over to the beach and then around the headland back down to the harbour side and have lunch in the sailing club very nice food and million dollar view. Then back to the quay and straight up to the train no hassle, you can buy a ticket that includes both train and ferry at any railway station."

We live in Sydney and we take every one of our out of town visitors on this trip, mas a result have done it many times and never get sick of it."

Every visitor to Sydney should regard Manly and Bondi Beaches as essential to visit and, in the case of Many, a ferry from Circular Quay really is the only way to do it. There are two possibilities, the old Manly Ferry takes 30 minutes and you get to see both the northern and southern banks of the eastern side of the harbour at a leisurely pace. The other option is the fast catamarans which take less than half the time. Why not go out on one and return on the other. Manly is worth a full day visit to take in the harbour beaches, the ocean beaches, the Corso that links the two, a trip up to North Head and, of course the local food and drink."

It leaves from Circular Quay and takes about 30 minutes to get to Manly using a large ferry. Two tips - on the return leg, try and leave Manly towards dusk so that you get amazing views of the Opera House and Bridge as you come back into Sydney - and consider departing from Darling Harbour via Sydney Ferries, connecting at Circular Quay (move between wharf 5 and 3). This costs a few dollars more but you get to enjoy a cruise under the bridge."

            "review": "See the Harbour & More- GREAT VALUE!. When visiting Sydney there is no cheaper way to get out on the water than to use the Manly Ferry commuter passenger ferry. Departing frequently from Circular Quay, this ferry route takes you all the way to Manly which is a fair distance from your departure point. The cost (return) is around $12, however it might be worth looking into one of the many 'day-pass' options that affords you the convenience of riding all ferry's, trains and buses anywhere in the Sydney system (around $30-40) Be sure to not try and do this trip during the morning or afternoon rush hour as you will find yourself waiting, often for a three or four sailing delay while commuters make their way into the city for work. Go mid day, sit outside on the top, bow area and take in the great views. You will get good photo opportunities during the approximately 30 minute voyage. Firstly, as you depart, the iconic Harbour Bridge towers above on the left, then the Opera House on the right. As you make your way towards Manly wharf, you will have a chance to see all of the other boats & sailing traffic which is exciting and can be dramatic as the others will pass by very closely. Upon arrival in Manly, make your way to the walking plaza, which leads towards the beach. Depending on the weather, take in the multitude of shops and food/beverage options or enjoy the sands of Manly beach. For an historical beer at an infamous Sydney haunt, make your way to The Steyne Hotel, an Aussie hotel/pub perfectly located in the heart of Manly. Spend a couple of hours exploring and taking in this toni neighbourhood that is the destination of millions of visitors every year. The best part of this trip, to me is the inexpensive cost of the ticket to board a boat and take a very scenic ride through the world famous Harbour. Highly Recommend!"

The ferry heads across the harbour to Manley, about a 30 minute trip, providing great views of the Sydney harbour. Although I arrived by cruise ship the view of the harbour is much better on the ferry as you are closer to the action of the harbour and you get a feeling of what the port is really about. This is a wonderful way to get in touch with Sydney and its waterfront, and, as a bonus, there is the welcoming town and beach of Manley at the end of the ride."

It's the cheapest ay to get a view of the Sydney Opera House from the front angle. When you board go to the front of the ferry (the side facing the pier) so that when it leaves the pier you will be able to take photos of the Sydney Opera House and the Sydney Harbour Bridge from the ferry. Spectacular views."

Rather than pay handsomely for a tourist trip, we decided to take the ferry to Manly and so take in another of the 'sights' - Manly Beach. We are so pleased that we did.It was a very pleasant Autumn day, which of course helps, and the views from the boat were splendid - all the tourist shots of the Harbour Bridge and the Opera House you could want. The rest of the scenery is not at all bad either; what a wonderful area it is.The ferry itself was efficient, clean and tidy and just the perfect way to travel to Manly."

The ferry ride itself was fine (about 30 minutes), and is a great way to catch some amazing views of Sydney. However, Manly beach itself was not really what I had expected. It may have been due to the fact that we were there Easter weekends, but the crowds were horrendous. It didn't feel relaxing at all. We ended up cutting our time there short, but if we returned, I would give it a second chance. I think we maybe would have enjoyed it more if we would have ventured further away from all of the activity and taken a walk or bike ride."

Manly is a quint and beautiful, please visit the beach and have a picnic, it's slight windy but beautiful . Beware of some vicious pigeons , who will fly off with your Lunch. The places to eat are plentiful , take time to stroll and enjoy Manly, the pace there is easy and much tone down after Sydney . There is also a museum small , but worth the visit."

We went during the school holidays so the beach became very full by midday. The Ferry takes you to the rocky side of Manley. It is then a 10 minute walk through the town to get to the Manley beach.

The last time I travelled I bought a MyMulti day pass for $22 which allowed me unlimited travel on public transport throughout the Sydney metropolitan area. The only transport that attracts an extra fee is the Fast Ferry service and the airport railway stations,, where you must pay a surcharge at the gate. It represents great value for money; I travelled from the western suburbs by bus, train to my hotel, to and from Manly on the ferry and then to the airport by train.The Manly Ferry evokes wonderful childhood memories for me, and I still consider it to be the cheapest and best way to see the Harbour."

There are two chouices in ferries, the traditional old style ferries and the more modern high speed catamarans. Opt for the older, large ferries which were sailed to Sydney from the UK in what must have been a truly remarkable voyage. Our most recent experience was on a sunny but blustery day which provided some thrills as the ferru tackled the high swells rolling in through the heads. Quite exciting!Manly is both a desireable residential area and a very popular tourist detination. A walk through the Corso, the outdoor shopping strip that links the harbour to the Pacific Ocean beaches, is most enjoyable. There is ample shopping and a great variety of food choices, including excellent fish and chipos which just seem to to taste better when eaten on a bench facing the ocean."

If you are in Sydney for only a few days then do try and take the ferry over to Manly The Manly ferries go from jetty three at Circular Quay - you can easily identify them as they are considerably larger than the others. There are four of them that trundle over to Manly every day - Narrabeen, Collaroy, Freshwater and Queenscliff - all named after well known Northern Sydney beaches.Each can take up to 1100 passengers and if you are observant you can see the passenger counters by the ticket check machines at Circular Quay and Manly and they indicate how many spaces are left on the vessel -quite intriguing watching them click over. The ferries predictably can be very busy at weekends during the Christmas holidays/January. In the main they run every half hour and the crossing takes about half an hour.On occasions it can get a bit 'choppy' as the ferry crosses the Gap - an area of open sea away to the right as you start to approach Manly wharf. The boat can toss a bit if it is rough but this part of the journey is only say three minutes.If you are in Sydney for a few days and propose to use public transport do consider getting a My Multi weekly ticket which are $44 for Zone 1 - this covers all the local trains, ferries and buses but NOT the trains out to the airport. It is so much easier having the one ticket without having to buy one each time.The Manly Ferry is one of the iconic 'things to do' in Sydney and offers great views there and back."

There is a good restaurant right by the Ferry port (Manly Wharf Hotel) - some food is typical Sydney price (i.e. high but not unusually so) but their daily specials are good value (e.g. Monday is Fish & Chips with a beer or wine for $16).The Ferry itself is punctual & well organised also has free wifi so you can post all those pictures straight onto Facebook!It is, well, a ferry, but the boat itself is not important it's the view.If you live in NSW and have kids then do it on a Sunday and use City Rail Family Funday tickets - then it's 2.50 each instead of a lot more full price."

            "review": "Ferry To Manly World Class. The ferry from Circular Quay to Manly (including of course Manly Beach), is world class. You buy a ticket before trying to get on, and then board for about a 30 minute easy and safe ride to Manly. This is all inner harbour, though there is a point near the end where the ferry touches the outlet to the ocean and so the waves are a little more vigorous there for about two or three minutes. I considered that the \"thrill ride\" aspect of the ride, but it was in no way threatening or dangerous. It felt good and the waves were no threat whatsoever.When visiting Sydney, you need to see Manly Beach at least once and to get there, in my opinion, the best way is to get to Circular Quay and then ride a ferry boat to Manly (and return the same way).Once you get to Manly and alight from the ferry, then in walking out of the ferry building, consider some candy (lollies) from the candy stand in the middle or eat at one of the many places to get a meal or a smoothie. The licorice ropes were wonderful. Not cheap, but wonderful. From there, the Corso opens up. The Corso leads to Manly Beach and is lined on both sides with shops and places to get a meal. There is a lot of great fun to be had there. Yes, plenty of souvenir tee shirts and the like and shops at all price ranges. I will say more about the Corso and Manly Beach in a later post.In any event, when visiting Sydney, you owe it to yourself to use the ferries. The most famous seems to be the one to and from Manly, from Circular Quay. Take take the ride. Live a little.Also, the ferries are a great and easy way to get to the sites around the harbour, including Watson's Bay, Taronga Zoo and Darling Harbour. Every one of those is worth an extended visit ir two."

The views were nice and the trip was smooth til we got to a portion of the harbor that was open to the Tasman Sea. The ferry rocked a little bit as we crossed this portion, but not enough to cause seasickness...or at least no one in my immediate area at the fore section of the top deck was affected."

We especially enjoyed the trip to Manly, not that the ferry was any different to the others but the destination, Manly, is worth a visit.We spent a day in Manly, and in our opinion the beach is better than its more well known neighbour, Bondi.As you leave the Ferry Berth at Manly, walk across the road and go down The Corso, the beach is on the opposite end of the Corso.As you arrive at the beach if you turn right and walk along the Marine Parade to Shelley Beach. This is worth a look. We are not beach people but the walk and views are terrific. Towards Shelley Beach you will spot many steel statues and models set in the rocks.You will find lots of eating places fronting the beach, the prices are reasonable and choice is varied.with lots of sea food and the usual fish and chips (Barramundi). We even found one offering deep fried mars bars. This to us is a Scottish 'delicacy', don't know how it found its way to Manly"

School kids and business people do this journey twice a day, passing Sydney's two great landmark icons - the Harbour Bridge and the Opera House - each time. I hope they realise how fortunate they are!The journey takes around half an hour, and never ceases to thrill - not only because of the sights, of course, but also when the ferry crosses The Heads - the point where Sydney Harbour ends and the open Pacific Ocean begins. Here, even on a calm day, you can feel the swell of the sea.The ferries themselves are real workhorses - functional, solid ships that ply back and forth dozens of times a day. For me, a trip on this route is an absolute 'must'; one of the essentials on a visit to Sydney. Try it yourself, and see if you agree!"

Manly ferry runs every 1/2 hr or so from Circular Quay. Trip takes approx 3 minutes.Try to get up the front outside on the top deck on the trip over to Manly, fantastic views. Very easy getting off and on, information ctre just outside ferry terminal. Walk through shops and cafes in the Corso to get to the beach, change rooms at the Surf Life Saving up the other end of the beach, on the right. Free showers. Plenty of fancy seafood restaurants near beach front, also good fish and chip take aways at reasonable prices. Take water bottle with you, can fill up at free filtered taps on beach front. Listen to life guard announcements, tell you if stinging jellyfish coming in. Some people ignored their warnings where to swim and got stung.If you pack your own lunch like some families did, can be a cheap day out, great atmosphere."

It was around AU$22, and cheaper than the return tickets together.A word of warning though: there might be surf that makes the boat sway."

Its about a 30 minute trip. You leave Circular Quay, go past the Opera House, past Fort Denison, past many of Sydneys luxury harbourside residences, see the Harbour Bridge in all its glory for great photo opportunites and then cross the heads. The Heads are North Head and South Head, the two peninsulas that seperate north from south and lead Sydney into the Pacific Ocean. Past the heads you will soon be in Manly - where you have brilliant still harbour swims on one side and a world famous surf beach on the other. Manly is famous for its restaurants and beach culture. Well worth spending a day there, especially if you have kids. A day out at Manly, arriving on the Ferry is a very authentic Australian outing."

Taking the ferry to Manly from Circular Quay is a must do when visiting Sydney or just a great way to enjoy Sydney Harbour. The Manly Ferry goes regularly and deposits you on the Harbour side of the suburb of Manly, as the old saying goes, \"seven miles from Sydney, 1,000 miles from care\". A short walk up \"The Corso\" and you arrive at the beautiful Manly ocean beach. The ferry is calm until it goes \"between the Heads\" or the entrance to the Harbour itself. It can get a little bumpy then, which adds to the fun. Sit on the wharf side to get the best views of the Opera House and the expensive Sydney real estate."

We ended up going on Melbourne Cup day so there was a lot of excitement around as there was in the pub in Manly when we watched the event unfold and were able to rip up our modest and ignorant choices on our slips! Great day - Manly was heaving, sandy beach impressive but not the best area of Sydney to spend time but that is just a personal comment - fish luch was however fantastic. Ferry trip really gives you a great sense of the way Sydney have embraced the whole issue of ferry crossings and you even got to see where the Prime Minister can put her feet up and the exit channel out into the vast oceans for the massive liners that come and go into the harbour. Perhaps try some of the ferries that go up the Paramatta as a contrast?"

If you are staying in Sydney proper, and wish to visit Manly (not sure why you would, other than \"because everyone does\"), the ferry ride will cost you more than other destinations. Reason: Manly is farther away (30 minutes by ferry). There is also something called the express ferry, but it will still take nearly 20 minutes one way. The regular ferries are run by the New South Wales government. The express ferry is a privately run venture and is more expensive. If you are planning to take the ferry to various destinations, look into a MyMulti Day Pass. This will get you unlimited access on all ferries, buses, and trains that are run by the New South Wales government."

Have your camera ready, the city, Opera House and the Harbor Bridge from the ocean is incredible. I also enjoy taking photo's of Luna Park. If you can go one way during day light hours and return of a night it's the best of both worlds. Manly is a fun place to visit as well. A little touristy but worth a visit.

This meant that most of the ferry ride was in darkness, with only the twinkling lights of homes on the shoreline were visible. It was beautiful but I will definitely take the ferry again in daylight, and don't recommend a ferry ride past 8 p.m.When you board the ferry, head straight upstairs to the top floor and then right to the front of the boat. Here you'll find a small amount of outdoor seating that provides an unobstructed view for your ride. Be warned that it can be very windy and cool in the outdoor area, so you may want to bring a light jacket or hoodie. Because the seating was limited it filled up quickly, but then seats freed up as people headed inside to take a break from the wind. If there aren\u2019t any seats available at first, stay close and some may open up part way through the ride.Also, there is a cafe on-board but it was closed when I took the evening ferry.

He therefore took the Manly Ferry to work every day. He was blown away with such a tranquil and stress free way to go to work and back. He now works near the Olympic Park and has an hours journey to work and back every day. He certainly misses his lovely Ferry journey, I can gell you."

You don't go under the bridge, but the ferry takes you past the opera house and you get great views of the bridge and opera house as you power off towards Manly beach.The trip takes about 35 mins each way, and the ferries run every 20 minutes. They close the admission gates 2mins before departure, so don't be late! Your ticket is for any trip, however, so if you miss one, just take the next sailing.You can choose to be outside or inside. There are plenty of seats all over the ferry. Everyone tends to cram onto the parts that offer the views of the bridge, so be prepared to wrestle for photo positions!Once you get over to Manly, you can get off and have a look over there. My friend and I simply stayed on and came straight back, but if you have time, I think you could spend a lovely couple of hours over in Manly at the beach.There is a cafeteria of sorts on the ferry, but it wasn't the cleanest, so I wouldn't like to buy anything that could give me food poisoning! Take your own snacks if you can't wait the 35 mins to get to Manly.There is no smoking anywhere on the ferry, in case you were tempted... Ferry officials prowl the boat looking out for anything troublesome, so make sure you behave!Price-wide, best value for Harbour views hands down. A good, no-nonsense way to see some of this beautiful Harbour."

If you're looking for a great day out and about then the ferry trip to Manly is fantastic, they run very frequently and are reasonably priced, The ferries themselves have both indoor and outdoor seating, so depending on the weather and how many photo's you wish to take there's an option that'll suit.Manly itself is great beach area, with plenty to do and see, some great food and drinks can be had from many number of places, there's a great German biergarden on the very waterfront, which I would highly recommend, from your pale ales, and pilsners, to a decent glass of wine."

Sit inside for the comfortable seats, or ride outdoors on limited number of bench seats and take in the salt air.Take the ferry round trip (1 hour) even if you don't have time for a day in Manly.Tip: Allow extra time for ticketing from the ticket machines. Lines form around a few machines, and tourist are unfamiliar how to use. Cash or credit card.Tip II: Also available, same wharf area, is a private operator of Manly Fast Ferries. Save 13 minutes out of 30 for premium price. But why rush the trip if you are a tourist?"

Departing from Circular Quay to Manly to the North of Sydney, the view of the Sydney Opera House on the port side is not to be missed and so is the view of the Sydney Bridge from the stern - have those cameras ready! Of course there is the other high speed ferry to Manly but I highly recommend this slow but steady as she goes old vessel reminiscent of years gone by befitting so much of Sydney's past history. Go early and spend your entire day around Manly with many available walks and time your return to catch the sunset just behind the old \"Coat Hanger\" for the perfect day away from Sydney."

Why would you take any of the Harbour Cruises on offer from Circular Quay when you can take the cheaper, more enjoyable ferry across to Manly - where, once there, you can wander up to North Head or just around to Shelley Beach; or along the promenade up to Queenscliff; take a drink on North Steyne beach or overlooking the wharf, have a surf - or just stay on the ferry and head back again. It is clean, efficient and affordable - toilets on board, usually a kiosk to buy drinks from, with inside and outside seating. The ferry offers all the best views from the harbour of the iconic sights plus the extras: Kirribilli House; Farm Cove; Rose Bay sea planes; Watson's Bay light house; the Heads; Middle Harbour. Coming back to the Quay in the evening, drawing past the Opera House to the left and Bridge to the right,is one of the world's most spectacular and affordable sights. Be warned though, as summer approaches, tourist influxes may make for quite crowded ferries - especially on the weekends. I've sat outside at the front and not seen a thing because of 2 rows of tourists standing in front of me taking photos! Asking them to occasionally move though does make a great opener to meeting new people. Just enjoy - everyone else is."

We are locals to Manly (live 1.5 kms away) and I would always recommend any tourist to our beautiful city to take the ferry and come over to the North, it is the cheapest harbour cruise you will get and the North side of Sydney is gorgeous. We never get sick of seeing our beautiful harbour this way and catch the ferry all the time into the CBD. If you are active and have a few hours then I highly recommend the scenic walk, you can do all or part of it. If you want to walk all the way to the Spit bridge it is 10kms one way, some parts are difficult but it is worth doing if you have no mobility issues. When you get off the ferry keep to the left side and you will pass Nando's, turn left and walk along the harbour towards the Manly Aquarium and go past it. You will see a set of steps, once you are up there you are on the walking path, enjoy! It really is worth it, I run along here all the time and never tire of it :-) It might be worth downloading a map or asking the tourist info office for one before setting off but there should always be people to ask if you need any help. If you aren't up for that much walking then keep going straight ahead from the ferry and walk down the Corso towards the surf beach. At the beach if you turn right and head South there is a very pleasant walk to Shelley Beach, the walk to Shelley from the beach is only 1km one way. For a nice cocktail I highly recommend Sugar Lounge as a lovely place to relax. There are also markets on every weekend in the Corso and Manly is well worth a visit (even though I am biased, hehehe)."

Best pictures of the Opera house form the ferry! $14 AUS round trip!If you're taking the ferry, try to take the seats outside, and most of the views would be to the right hand side (if you're traveling in the direction of Manly). I'd think the best seats to take are the ones on the rear, to your left since you can look back at the city when the ferry travels to Manly. On the way back sit on the opposite side to get another view.There is a cafe onboard in case you want to get a drink or some nibbles.Manly id a fun place ! Walk the beach to the right and follow he path. You will see sea birds and even water dragons!No you wont get sea sick the ferry is large and very stable.Have fun!"

The Manly ferry is easy to catch from Circular Quay, located on the airport side on the river between the Sydney Harbour Bridge and the Opera House. It is easy to catch a train there from the airport (each way about $25 per person and a 20 minute journey) The ferry costs about $20 round trip and tickets are easy to book from the kiosk at the Quay. There is a fast ferry, but you will miss a lot of the magnificent scenery. The normal ferry is about a 30 minute trip each way and the fast ferry a little under 20 minutes each way. Allow at least an hour (preferably longer) so you can enjoy the sites and surrounds of Manly.From the ferry you will get great view of the Sydney Harbour Bridge, the Opera House, Garden Island, and then out to Manly where you can do some shopping or enjoy some time on the beach front Cafes, Restaurants and Bars.Highly recommended."

It is much less expensive than going on a harbour cruise and make sure you check out the discounted family fares. You see the harbour in all it's glory and then you can spend a bit of time at Manly beach. The Corso has heaps of souvenir shops. You can grab some fish and chips and eat them on the beach or visit one of the many restaurants or pubs for a feed. Grab an ice cream at Ben and Gerry's before another nice ride on the harbour back to the Quay."

This is by far the best way to see the famous Sydney landmarks from the Quay then 25 mins later be in Manly, the beginning of 21 superb northern beaches. Off the ferry, directly across the road and along the pedestrian Corso, within 15 minutes you have left the harbour and are standing on the sands of the Southern Paci fic Ocean. Restaurants abound- especially fresh seafood, which suit all budgets. A truly wonderful day trip, especially for families. A return adult fare Is A$14.00. Having returned to my hometown after twenty five years, this was my first \"must do\" and it didn't disappoint as the perfect way to reconnect with the most beautiful harbour in the world (Auckland and Hong Kong are close!)."

The ferry is nothing special, but the Sydney Harbour Basin is, so make sure you take your camera with you. You'll get amazing views of the Harbour Bridge and the Opera House, of Kirribilli House, all the suburbs along the Harbour Basin, and you'll even go past the Harbour entrance, so you'll get some nice views out onto the ocean. It lands right in the middle of Manly, and from there, a lazy 5 minute walk will get you to Manly Beach.

The entire beauty of the building can not be captured. One of the best places is on the ferry to Manly. However, you will have to jockey for the coveted seat up front to the far right by the railing. Otherwise, you will have a stranger squinting in your picture like I did.Once on Manly there is a distracting tourist shop and eat area straight ahead. However, if you walk through to the beach and head to the left there is a fantastic coastal walk. I will warn you that there are HUGE spiders and webs along the trail. That didn't sit well with me, but the locals don't even bother to look up. If you can overlook the spiders the opportunities for beautiful photos are endless.For an adult evening, I recommend visiting The Pony Room. The place is cool! Finding it is a bit of a challenge. Facing the ocean, it is to the far left of the shopping/restaurant area just south of the tennis courts heading towards the ocean. There is a small patch of fake grass in front. The outside is unimpressive, but the inside is really eclectic and tasteful. This is a lounge bar for sitting back and unwinding. I learned of this place will passing through the duty free shopping coming in from New Zealand."

We got great fish & chips and sat by the beach and people-watched which was a very relaxing afternoon! The ferry was super-easy to figure out and was the most direct, convenient way to get to Manly Beach from Circular Quay. Plus, the ferry offered great views of the Opera House - an angle you cannot get from any other location. If you go in late afternoon, and take the ferry back to Circular Quay around sunset, it's gives a chance for some really great pictures!"

The trip from Manly to Circular Quay takes thirty minutes and the famous slogan from the 1940s, 'Manly, 7 Miles from Sydney and 1000 miles from care', still holds well today. The ferries are roomy and clean and you can choose to sit outside for the full freshair experience or inside where the seats are padded and you can still see the views of the magnificent Sydney Harbour foreshore and the many yachts and othe craft out sailing on the harbour. Places of interest to be seen from the ferry as it leaves Circular Quay for Manly include the Museum Contemporary Art on the left, the Opera House on the right, Harbour Bridge and then as it heads east up the Harbour it passes Admiralty House and Kirribilli House on the left, then Fort Denison , the Botanical Gardens and Mrs Macquarie's Chair, Garden Island, on past Taronga Park Zoo, Rose Bay, Watson Bay etc , Clifton Gardens, Balmoral, the Heads to the Harbour and then into Manly. Near Manly there is still a large area of park and bushland right on the Harbour forshore. This is certainly a must for visitors to Sydney!"

So my first impression of Sydney was \"this is it?\"... the city itself is bland and lacks character, and many of the \"charming\" neighborhoods look run down and could use a good landscaper. When you get on the Manly Ferry, however, you realize what it is about Sydney that makes it memorable: the water. This 30-minute ferry ride is worth the trip to Manly in itself. You get to see the vast harbor and all the little villages facing the water. It's the perfect getaway from the concrete blandness that is Sydney. Manly is a cute seaside town where you can walk from the harbor side of the town to the lovely beach on the ocean side in 15 minutes. This walk is full of shops and restaurants and cafes--an easy way to spend a day before catching the ferry back to Circular Quay.This little trip on the Manly Ferry should not be missed by any visitor. It's the perfect peek into what makes Sydney special, and it feels like a little vacation. It does get crowded on the weekends though, so a trip during the week might be more enjoyable."

The ferry takes about 25 minutes and takes you to the \"North Head\" area - North Head is the northern peninsula at the opening of Sydney Harbour. Beyond North Head and South Head is the open Pacific Ocean. If you like chocolate, stop in at Max Brenner on the Manly ferry dock on the right as you exit. Fabulous hot chocolates of various flavors, chocolate fondue, etc. Then walk out the dock area and across the street and walk straight ahead and then slightly to the right and down the \"corso\" to the ocean. The concourse (\"corso\") is an area of shops and restaurants lining a street which becomes pedestrian-only as it approaches the ocean. Street musicians and water spouts coming up through the sidewalk, sculpture and coffee shops fill the pedestrian walkway. Manly Beach is at the end of the walk. A stunning beach with a wide walkway with trees on one side of the road, and on the other side shops and restaurants. For a gorgeous day go to the beach and then turn RIGHT. Follow the side walk and you will come to a walkway that will take you around the shore to the next sheltered little beach (Shelly Beach) which is beautiful. There is a cafe there if you want to stop and have something to eat. Or keep going along the path up the hill for a bushwalk along the cliff top and out to North Head (it's supposed to be about a 2.5 to 3 hour total walk). We walked for about 30 minutes up into the bush and then turned back after we got to a sweet little pond filled with frogs singing. We then walked back down, past Shelly beach again, and found a restaurant across from Manly Beach and had a delicious late lunch. Then we strolled through the shops on our way back to the Ferry. The sun set early and the moon rose as we took the ferry back to Sydney. It was a magical day. Fresh air and gorgeous views. A very affordable and wonderful day out."

If you are on a budget this is a good replacement for a more expensive Harbour Cruise. We paid $12 per person return.Because the ferries run so often you never have too long to wait and the timetables are well published. They are huge and take an immense number of people. They have lots of outside space so tourists can line up and take their photos of Sydney Harbour. I got my best pictures of Sydney on this ferry journey.

All kinds of water craft can be on the water, so wave and smile. people will like it. Off to your right you see the rich people's houses along the waterfront, rising up the cliffs. You go past the Heads (the place where the bay of Sydney meets the open ocean), so if there's a swell, there may be a bit of rocking.

I have had my heart in my mouth as well on occasions when the swell has been roaring in between North and South Heads. The nose of the vessel dips into the swell and the spray comes right up over the bow. The Captain has to take a direct path in towards the North Head to get into the lee of the land before deviating towards Manly. A trip to Sydney would not be complete without a ride on a Manly Ferry."

We were so delighted by the great view of the Opera House, you get very close to it from this ferry!From the upper deck we enjoyed the harbour and city view, and also the totally different and more relaxing feeling as we approached the pier at Manly.

At night it comes alive with lights and seagulls who ride the wind alongside you.For those visitors staying in Sydney the Manly Ferry takes them to the beautiful seaside town on the other side of the harbour. I can't recommend Manly enough - I miss it now I'm home! Laid back, full of personality, great beach and lovely atmosphere."

I like the feel, but my motion sickness prone daughter was a bit on edge (she made it though). Nothing to do in Manly without the beach, so we headed straight back, but I would say this is worth the money and worth the time even if all you do is go over and back.

Catching an older, historic ferry is delightful and I would strongly recommend sitting outside, up the front - unless its raining of course!!

We took the city bus #180 to the Spit Bridge and walked the 10km (6 mile) Manly Scenic Walkway....just a wonderful way to see the harbour, forest and parts of Sydney. A truely fantastic walk.Took the ferry back to the city. The ferry is clean, busy, easy to get onto and remember to sit on the left hand side so you can see the Opera House!"

They go past the \"heads\" which are the entrance to Sydney harbour with glorious cliff faces. They go past Shark Island, the Opera house and pull up next to the Harbour bridge at Circular Quay. If the seas are rough, you could get a bit sea sick as you pass the heads - when the ferry is exposed to the ocean rather than being protected by the harbour. Manly has a harbour and a surf beach. The walk along \"the Corso\" between the two beaches has a lovely feel. It is mostly a pedestrian walkway. Manly oceanworld is located on the harbourside beach to the left of the wharf as you face manly."

You are not paying for a pricey tour this way and how much commentary do you need when the view speaks for itself. Manly Beach is polluted, not attractive, and crowded. So walk up on the hill above the beach to get vantage point views. Then getback on the ferry to see the views as you return to Sydney.

At Manly there's a lovely tree lined sandy beach with restaurants and cafes just back from the beach. Picnic areas abound in this area. There is also a lovely walk along the edge of the rocks to a little place called Shell Bay and a nice little very popular restaurant called Fairy Glen, or there was when we last visited five years ago. It's lovely just sauntering along by the edge of the water stopping now and then just to take in the views. On the Ferry you can buy refreshments, but as the trip from Manly to Circular Quay is quite short it's probably cheaper buy something before boarding. Sit inside or outside, the choice is yours. We always went for the seats at the back outside where there were fewer people, most tourists wanting to go up top for a better view. Do the Manly Ferry or you'll miss something special.

Then a short walk down The corso of shops to the REAL CORSO -which is the long beach and paved walk next to it. A place to change into your swimwear,a toilet, and there is a shower outside to wash the salt off you. You have a choice of restaurants to eat at, small snacks (pies,burgers,etc) across the street. Many seats under the many tall pines,you can sit on the wall between beach and walkway.There's a fenced walk to another small secluded beach.

Sydney is sooo expensive, but I was recommended by locals to try the Manly Ferry to (1) see more of the harbour across the coast and (2) for a great beach experience whilst in Manly. We were not to be dissappointed. The ferries run every half hour from circular quay from wharf 3 and the return journey was $14 which by sydney standards is reasonable. Once you arrive in Manly it is a short 5-10 minute walk depending on how hot it is to go to the beach and watch the surfers catch the waves. Lots of great cafes and shops to look at on the way and along the beach road. Wish we had longer to stay there, it was a relaxing alternative to the busy city. Return ferries are also every half hour and tickets can be purchased on board and at each terminal. The ferry is completely accessible for wheelchair users."

Manly has been improved in recent years and is a lot more salubrious than it used to be, however, taking the ferry is far better and easier than driving as parking can be a nightmare."

If you are in Sydney for only a short time, 1/2 days, the easiest and cheapest way to see the harbour is to get the Manly ferry from Circular Quay. Make sure you get one of the old ferries not a Hydrafoil (too quick) and sit on opposite sides for the two trips and you will see all of the harbour...you wont get a commentary but I am sure if you ask one of the locals they will point out places of interest. At Manly go for a short walk .plenty of cafes and get the next ferry back...about two hours ."

This will also allow train and bus travel for that day.I emphasise the Ferry - not the Hydrofoyle. The Ferry is slower but better for the day tripper.Manly can give you 2 to 3 hours of just looking about. Maybe lunch or dinner - or brekkie.Well worth a trip."

Sailboats glide by and friendly locals wave hello, champagne in hand. Feed the seagulls as the accompany you and soak up the glittering view, or enjoy a sunset as you return towards the Harbour Bridge and the Opera House. For the adventurous, catch a ferry on a wild day and brave the trip through the heads, a favourite thing to do when we were kids. And remember 'Sunday-Funday' Adults can travel for $2 or so with up to four kids all day on all transport in the Sydney area. Cant beat that for value."

Simply visit the gorgeous Manly beach and wharf during the day and then get the ferry back at around 6ish depending on what time sunset is, be first in the boat so you can get a front row seat up on deck on the ferry and then snap away as you approach into the bay. You can get some simply stunning shots this way and it costs practically nothing as the ferry is very cheap."

There are some fantastic photo opportunities on the ferry for toursits too and the first time we came round and the Opera House and Harbour Bridge came into view was very impressive.Manly has a fantastic beach, one of the best in Australia so if you are staying in Sydney it is still worth the trip over to Manly for the beach and the shops on the Corso there.There is also free wifi available on the ferry which came in very handy for me to check emails and keep in touch with people at home in the UK much cheaper than calling or finding internet cafes.

You can book a three hour cruise of Sydney Harbour where a guide will tell you what to look at and that does get close to the shore line at times, or you can hop on a Manly Ferry and see most of the harbour on the way to Manly. Apart from being cheaper (if you get a return ticket, or a DayTripper ticket that includes trains and buses, it'll be even cheaper) than a cruise, you'll end up at Manly which is (I think) a must-do destination in Sydney.The Manly ferries have small shops selling drinks and snacks at reasonable prices, and there are plenty of places to sit/stand to take in all the views.The starboard side (from Circular Quay) will provide you excellent views of the city, Eastern Suburbs, the Heads and then Manly, so try to grab a seat downstairs outside. Coming back, sit on the starboard side (this time it's the side facing west) to get great views of Balmoral, Mosman, Cremorne and Neutral Bay (and all their harbour beaches) as well as North Sydney and the harbour bridge - oh, and this is also the warmer side in the afternoon unless there's a southerly wind blowing!If you like rough weather, get yourself to the front of the ferry and enjoy the ride! In really rough weather the front of the ferry will bury itself in the waves.Have fun!"

After watching the beach activities, we used the walking brochure to explore a nature area as well as neighborhoods of the town itself. Many outdoor restaurants and retail establishments line the beach street, as well as the walk to the beach from the ferry. The ferry was large, and people on it seemed to include locals as well as tourists. Our ride was thrilling as the ocean swells at the harbor opening were large and provided a salt water experience for those of us on the outer front deck. Take a camera as you will go directly in front of the Opera House and you will also have great views of the Harbor Bridge and Fort Denison."

The service was timely (as all the ferries were) even though it was very busy. We had bought a week Multi Pass which means we didn't have to queue - would definitely recommend this as you can travel on bus, train and ferry all on one ticket. The views from the ferry were lovely and we took many pictures of the Opera House and Harbour Bridge."

The ferries themselves seem kind of old, but not unsafe. There are benches outside if you don't mind being in the wind, but there are also indoor seats.Staff was friendly and efficient, and I would use the service again if I returned to Sydney."

From departing at Circular Quay until arriving at Manly Wharf thirty minutes later, passengers are treated to the most delightful vistas on offer in Australia's premier city.It is from the deck of the ferry that you see Sydney as it has been seen on a million postcards - the gleaming opera house jutting out into the harbour with the huge steel Harbour Bridge serving as a prominent backdrop. To the left, the CBD shoots high into the sky. There is no better way to view the city and, for a tourist, this ferry trip should be top of one's list of to-dos.Manly itself is no vulgarity. Without delving too much into the beach-side resort itself, the landscape at the other end of the ferry ride is vastly different with sparse houses perched in amongst lush vegetation and towering over steep rocky shorelines.Between the two, passengers are treated to a beautiful view of Sydney Heads and one's mind wanders off to the vastness of the ocean that sits just beyond that towering cliff side. The boat charts its course in amongst dozens of dinghies, sailing boats, speedboats and jet boats and thus offers a spectacle on each crossing. It is one of those ferry rides where you could happily lay back and look at nature's finest offerings in the archipelago that is Sydney Harbour or you could intently look out over the hive of activity that the city's waterways offer.It is $10 per ride and the ride takes 30 minutes. In all of the time I was in Sydney, I am not sure I spent a more valuable tenner or thirty minutes than I did on this ferry. Though I should sound a note of caution that the boat is susceptible to a slight bit of movement as it crosses the harbour and thus those highly sensitive to travel sickness ought to be wary and place themselves appropriately on the vessel. For me, nothing beat sitting at the front on both legs of the trip for the stunning views of Manly on the way out and the impressive Sydney on the way in."

Lots of food options at the Manly Ferry Terminal, if you want to grab a snack or an ice-cream for your stroll down to Manly Beach. If you are only in town for a day then I recommend you get an \"all-day\" transport pass http://www.cityrail.info/tickets/which/mymulti_day. You can also get them for a week/month, etc if you are staying longer. You can buy the pass from the ferry ticket sellers, or any train station & it gives you unlimited rides on buses, trains and government ferries (but NOT the catamaran/fast ferry to Manly) - it pays for itself easily and certainly saves your feet as there is a lot of walking to enjoy around Sydney :-))"

Manly is a lovely place with beautiful beaches and views of the ocean. I did a 3 hour walking tour that was in my tour book - all around the coast areas, up through the neighborhoods overlooking the ocean (with incredible homes). Lovely seafood platter lunch at a restaurant (Manly Wharf Hotel) by the harbour. A great day outing. Highly recommend."

Not to mention all the harbor boat traffic, including sail boats on weekends.

Good selection of shops at Manly and a pal tells me the Pizza restaurant by the ferry terminal is the dogs whatsits - sadly we were out of time"

            "review": "Yes, Public Transport is an Attraction by Itself. It may seem odd to write a review of public transportation, but the Manly Ferry qualifies as an attraction worthy of review unto itself. (The destination, Manly Beach, is also beautiful.) The ferry is relatively inexpensive, runs on-time and with efficiency, and is the best way to introduce yourself to Sydney's amazing harbour. Sit outside, if you can, and as you leave Circular Quay snap pictures of the Opera House, Harbour Bridge, and CBD. Then, as you keep sailing, you'll get great views of all of the waterside homes built into the cliffs on the harbour. Sit back, enjoy the sunshine, and have a great ride! If you can, catch the ride back to Sydney on one of the ferries that leaves before sunset; the views you'll have of the sun-setting in the harbour are very picture-worthy. Each time I take the ferry, I think it's about 40 mins. of paradise."

If the weather is nice, sit on the outside facing the side of the opera house. The boat does not turn around, it goes back and forth without turning so sit on the side of the opera house for an incredible view. Amazing photo opportunities. Once you reach Manly, walk straight up the street and after about 10 minutes you will reach the beach. Lot's of great restaurants to enjoy, then head back on the ferry. Great experience."

I took a ride on a whim while out looking for cheap dinner and was so pleased.I left Circular Quay at 6:30pm when it was still daylight everywhere. I got great photos, even with just my iPhone, and a chance to experience a little of what Sydney is like outside of the CBD. What was even cooler was on the way back the sun was setting and I got amazing sunset shots and great photos of the city and harbor bridge at night. Highly recommended, but check the sunset time first."

The ferry to Manly is a great way to experience the natural beauty of Sydney's natural harbour.If you're taking the ferry, try to take the seats outside, and most of the views would be to the right hand side (if you're traveling in the direction of Manly). I'd think the best seats to take are the ones on the rear, to your left since you can look back at the city when the ferry travels to Manly.There is a cafe onboard in case you want to get a drink or some nibbles."

To start, the ferries are wonderful old things, distinctive green, and provide a stable enough ride across the bay. And what a ride. From Circular Quay, you sail next to the Sydney Harbour Bridge, literally circling around the Sydney Opera House before heading towards Manly. The views of these icons, as well as the Sydney skyline, are just stunning \u2013 make sure you bring your camera! Get up close with the yacht and luxury boats as they enjoy a day on the water, and enjoy the sights of the Sydney harbour, all the way to the mouth of the harbour, where the open ocean beckons, before turning up to Manly.  Absolutely brilliant! A great ride, a sightseeing experience in its own right and a great way to get over to Manly. What more could you ask for?"

Ditto all the comments of the reviewer below...Manly is a great spot to go to for good bars and restaurants or just to spend time on the far bay and has actually been improved a lot since I was last there.But one tip is try to time an evening visit for when the sun sets (this was the 5.30PM ferry when I was here in end of March) and as you pull out of Sydeny harbour, as well as icon vies of the Opera House and bridge together you will be rewarded with a sun set to die for as the sun drops between the sails of the Opera house and the sky turns orange..for the record its 30 minutes across to Manly on the old ferry boat (which is the one I always do) and I think you cut off 11 minutes if you take the fast cat, but personally i would leave this one to the commuters.."

Travelling on a CityRail train is an interesting prelude to joining the iconic Manly ferry service.The latter takes half an hour each way. A typical frequency is a ferry each way every half hour although this varies slightly in peak hours.Passengers can view the world famous Sydney Opera House and Harbour Bridge, Fort Denison, the entrance to Sydney Harbour, bushland and residential development along the way.Cresting the waves is a compulsory addition to some trips, but in really bad weather, the ferry may not operate. In lieu, the Manly JetCat will provide a partial replacement service but the current NSW Government has decided that from 31 January 2009 the JetCat will cease operations.The ferries have some outdoor seating and a small onboard cafe.A holiday-like atmosphere prevails among many passengers outside peak hour.With Manly being a great destination, a trip on this ferry is highly recommended."
