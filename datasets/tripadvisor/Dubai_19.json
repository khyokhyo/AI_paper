            "review": "Fantastic day out. Visited today after booking a ski experience day yesterday, this package included a one hour ski lesson (we were both non-skiers), the penguin experience, a pass to the snow park including unlimited goes on the rides, a pair of ski gloves, equipment hire, a hot chocolate and a set meal.The lesson was fantastic there was only three of us on it but myself and my partner progressed really quickly and got taken from the nursery slope up to the next one, we got issued with a ski passport at the end of the lesson and were signed off the first two levels making us into skiers. We did the penguin experience and got to cuddle and pet a king penguin which was lovely. The ski park is great for youngsters but not so exciting for us older ones but we went on everything including a high speed 'bullet' ride and a zip wire these were good but not worth going on more than once. The only thing wrong with the day was how many times you have your photo taken by the photographers from the centre it slows everything down when you just want to get on with stuff and the photos are really expensive to buy at 125AED each although we did buy 2!! The hot choc was a lovely break during the day and we had our meal after we had finished in the park, we spent about 5 hours there in total - would love to re-visit but this time just to ski and not bother with anything else. Would highly recommend this place as a must do whilst in Dubai."

When it's so hot outside its hard to imagine needing a beanie, but be sure to pack one! We throughly enjoyed the different activities, despite not skiing or snowboarding. My daughter loved the tube slides and kept asking for more. The price and quality of food on the slope were not impressive at all."

I have learned to ski at Ski Dubai and all the instructors were very knowledgable and encouraging. Also i have been there a multiple of times for skiing and it was so much fun. You can find many activities to do, from zip lining, to penguin interaction, skiing, etc... So everyone is guaranteed to have fun especially that you are skiing in a -2 degree temperature while outside it is 37 or 45 degrees plus. Make sure to stop in the cafe on top of the slopes for a nice hot cup of coco."

There is something slightly insane about wandering through a sweltering 45 deg day, then going skiing in a mild 4 deg room. It is certainly an experience.Now I can't say it is a top slope, with heaps of length, but then again we are not outdoors. It is though really well done, with quite a few options and things for the kids, for the shopping centre it is in.I'd visit again if I am ever in Dubai again."

The run is very good for an indoor facility (about 400m). We took advice from previous reports about how cold it is inside and took extra clothes. We also took ski gloves because the ones they issue are not good enough. You should also bring your own beanie (warm hat) as they are not issued. We also used the other attractions in the centre which the kids loved. It was expensive for the 4 of us but understandable given what is required to keep it so cold."

The slopes are qood considering it\u00b4s an outdoor artificial stadium, you can learn from scratch, refresh, keep yourself in shape for your winter time in Alps or just come to Dubai instead of Alps in winter and save on summer/winter holidays package. The snow park is also great fun, esp. the slides a zorbing ball. Do get some functional underwear/leggins and a sweater because even after one hour you will get cold."

Pre paid for tickets before travelling to Dubai but when we got there our \u00a3160 didn't include everything and for additional activities we paid an extra \u00a390 approx. For this we got a penguin interaction where you could touch a penguin, a one to one hr ski lesson for my 3yr old and access into the snow dome for rides of which there are about 5. Your clothes are included which is gloves (that you can keep and were reasonable quality), coat, waterproof trousers, socks and snow boots. Given the temp you definitely need warm clothes underneath and prob hat and scarf too. The ski lesson was worth the money. The penguin interaction is not so good as you are not allowed to take pictures. Of course the professional photographer takes pictures that you can buy at great expense after. The rides inside are OK but after you have done them a few times and are cold it's time to go! It's OK but nothing more. I was pretty pleased to get back our into the warm sun."

But this time I took my youngest daughters to explore the other side. To tell you the truth it is the most memorable experience they have I guess. We had tickets 4 for 3, I got through Dubai ski application. It includes almost all activities except skiing. We met the penguins & knew something about these funny creatures. We had the chance to hug & kiss them. My daughters enjoyed lots of activities for their age like slides, the huge ball rolling down the slope & many others. The queues were quiet long but waiting time from 15-30min. Everything is available & included (lockers, gloves, clothes) but for sure you can bring yours. I think it is better to bring your own gloves & wear winter clothes below the skiing clothes cause it is very cold inside especially at the penguins area. It costs us around 1000 AED but it worth it. You must go there."

The staff at the till use this to find appropriate ski's and to adjust the bindings.It is by far the best and biggest indoor slope I have been on and the quality of the snow was great. If anyone has been to Tamworth snow dome in England, I would say it is roughly 2 and a half of that slope - except you get a chair lift up this one!Saw a few ski schools which looked very well ran and never got too far into the path of other slope users.A really positive experience -- a treasure for any skiers/boarders or anyone who fancies being in the snow...

Ski Dubai is just another reason to love visiting or living in Dubai, wonderful fun and for a family that loves to ski together it provides an invaluable and inexpensive (relatively speaking) opportunity to practice and enjoy the sport together.

Where else can it be 45 degrees celcits outside and have ski school carried out inside other than Ski Dubai. Fabulous fun and a great resource for this ski obsessed out there. I am not sure who calculates the levels of difficulty as they don't seem aligned with what would be found outside of this facility (overstated difficulty such as the near shopping centre being described as a black run) but there are still enough opportunities for me to plough down these gentle slopes with my face to ensure a constant amusement for my family and well wishing onlookers."

If you're looking for the novelty of saying you went skiing in Dubai with an outdoor air temperature of 39degrees this is for you. Essentially two basic blue runs, one short stretch of maybe a red - which is sold as a black run. Total distance is short, with maybe a hundred metres of skiable runs that are pretty straight and flat. Single 5seat chair lift up the middle and two faster button lifts up the sides that will all get you to the top. Would be a fun place for beginners, and kids - there are lots of added attractions that would be well suited to a young crowd."

Worth going and the kids love it. Advice - Arrive early or book early if you want to do the penguin visit as it gets quite busy. Only down side is that as its busy you might have to wait a while to get your equipment and the sizes seem to be a little off so don't be surprised if you have to change your boots to get the right foot size."

Everything - skiing , the chairlift is romantic , the tubing is fun, the ball is cool and let's u loosen up. I would suggest time yourself while taking the ticket .. if your taking it in morning time then take unlimited access to rides as u will have entire day. In evenings there is always a rush and line for rides so taking unlimited pass won't help as u will not get to do it as much. Do wear warm clothes while going for it. They do give you gloves, jacket, pants, socks and shoes but still it won't warm u totally if u wearing summer clothes beneath.It's fun and a good change."

We got our outfits and went through, as soon as we were about to go through we saw something happening with a goup of teenagers and the security and to be fair, it seemed like the security guards were having rings rung around them.When we got in it was nearly time for our penguin show, so when we went in for that the experience was amazing. getting to see these penguins so up close and getting pictures taken with them was a great experience.Once that was over, we manageed to fight our way through the children and the teenagers who were all going against all rules and went to the zorb ball. The queu was huge and it took about 45 minutes to eventually get there, but once we were there the experience again was amazing!! managed to land on my wrist right at the end, but thats just me, I can injure myself walking around my house so doing something like this, I was bound to lol.Once that was over, everything else that we went to go and see was just waaaay to busy, the quques were huge and seeing the groups of teenagers who were not being handled at all by security was really starting to put us off. We ended up walking out because time was getting on and it just didnt seem like we were getting any closer to going on anything.Overall it seems to be an amazing place and we enjoyed what we experienced, we just wish that it wasnt so busy and the people were handled better by security."

They've changed the super pass to Polar pass and included the chairlift and snowball rides which is good. Compare back then you can only access the tube ride and snow park. It is recommended to use an entertainer voucher and upgrade it to Polar Pass express. It will give you unlimited chairlift ride,unlimited snow ball ride plus a choice of either discovery lesson of skiing for beginners or 2 hours slope or penguin encounter or 2 rides of snow bullet plus snow park access and other unlimited rides included in Polar pass. We have opted for the discovery lesson since we don't know how to ski. It is better if you bring and use your own socks and gloves (make sure they're thick and can make you warm). Though they give free gloves and socks, if you spend like 5 hours inside the resort it'll will be soaked up in 2 hours time which is not advisable. Additionally have an extra leg warmer inside and bring your own woolen scarf and body warmer to make yourself comfortable while enjoying the ski. Just a note if you're going to try the discovery lesson, my friend and I thought it will be a one on one teaching lesson but it will be a group lesson instead. It is a little disappointing because some of the instructors think you'll get what they say in just one teaching which I don't think is not a good strategy if you wanted to make your customers sign up for the ski school. However, overall experience is quite good especially when they've added the chairlift ride."

An error on our part and misinformation from a 3rd party seller.....so Please be careful what sessions you book and where you book it. You also have to purchase your own gloves.However, after a disappointing start, the skiing lesson was excellent, very thorough and safety conscious. Our instructor was lovely and a lot of fun, I do wish we had the 2nd hour session to be able to progress from the beginner up a level as the skiing was great fun.

            "review": "Excellent entertainment for all ages.. Our experience was excellent and we enjoyed this a lot. Here are the tips:1. Book your stay at a hotel next to Mall of Emirates (MoE) and choose a hotel that gives out Ski Dubai entry tickets. We were booked at Novotel Suites which is 5 mins (or less) walk away and they gave us Ski Dubai tickets which were for unlimited time - meaning, we can come out and go back in again anytime during that day but minus Skiing and Ziplocking everything else was included.2. Prepare - Get ready for -4 C (negative 4) degrees temperature. So we brought our light warm jackets and leggings for kids. They will give you vouches for a free pair of gloves and will provide jackets, socks, pants, shoes and helmets for kids for free.3. Arrive early - Look at google and it will tell you the peak hours for Ski Dubai. we arrived at 10 AM and it took us one hour or so to get inside because it takes time to change and get the kids dressed up and all.4. The rush-hour starts to build up during the day, then vanishes off during lunch time and then again a peak rush between 3pm to 6 pm.5. The activities are all very nicely planned and safe. Kids are required to wear helmets, adults can choose to wear or not.6. In rush hours there are long lines for each activity however the attendants keep the place organized and tidy.7. They also give out voucher for food at a restaurant called St. Moritz which is good a simple lunch. Don't ask for fine dining seafood as they are good with simple chicken soup, sandwiches and burgers and a cup of coffee.8. The problem is that security doesn't let you go out if you are still wearing their shoes and attire. So take off your jaccket, while still in their pants and shoes and skip out from St. Moritz side entrance for a couple of smokes outside and come back.9. If you are wearing something full sleeves and a jeans or a training pants under their jackets and pants, you will be okay. Just dont forget to bring your warm caps.10. Either way the shop outside offers all kinds of snow apparel that you can buy.Totally Recommended !"

Certainly a must do when you come to Dubai: exploring the slopes covered in 'real' snow and swing down the hills, either the beginner level or advanced course. Obviously not the real thing, and not really too exciting for ski enthusiastic used to St. Moritz but where else can you enjoy 4 degrees inside while the thermometer shows 40 outside....two tipps: come early to avoid long queues. And come prepared with gloves and a jersey! Overall, ski shoes and skis are included in the price, but gloves you need to bring or buy...."

He did a few runs in less than an hour, which was enough to satisfy the bucket-list-y feeling. My complaint is that I was not skiing and therefore could not go inside the ski area.

It turns out this was for a \"comprehensive\" ticket, and what I really needed and wanted was the $200 AED two hour pass. This includes everything you need-- except gloves. Rather than blaming me or hiding behind some policy, the manager, a lovely Philipino woman, and her assistant, actually blamed the website's design and gave me a cash refund.I also bought gloves (necessary, I think) for a mere $10 American and they are ones I intend to keep. Very cool and branded \"Ski Dubai.\" The slope itself is short but not too short and fun -- and not too crowded on a Sunday.

It takes 5 min to get up to the top by chairlift and 30 seconds to get down. We enjoyed it just for the simple pleasure of it was something different to experience."

It was a brilliant experience, my husband who isn't much of an experienced skier, managed to get right to the top and ski down! It was an incredible experience and one we wont forget. The process once we arrived at Ski Dubai is really easy - make sure you take your confirmation. It is very busy - a lot busier than 2 years ago, so make sure you get there at least 30mins before a lesson."

As it turns out I don't need to bother since I can have fun despite not being knowledgeable with the main game. Me and my boyfriend slid in a rubber sled then went tumbling down in a huge zorb. I highly suggest this to kids and adults alike who wants the thrill and have loads of laughter afterwards.They have hot chocolate ready for those who are hypothermic on the ground floor and on the top of the slopes. We took the penguin encounter to see them up close and the trainers allowed us to pet them or stroke them according to when the animals are ready. Photos are available for a price that will allow access for only 2 weeks to download online.Sadly my only chance to view the whole ski area was to ride a chairlift and the 10 minute trip was the slowest I've ever been in but the photos I've taken were great."

We purchased the polar experience with the Penguin encounter. With that, we had unlimited access to the Snow Park, where we enjoyed toboggans, tubing, rolling down the hill in a giant ball and a roundtrip ride on the chairlift. We also enjoyed seeing the march of the Penguins where the staff provided education on the type of penguins at Ski Dubai. We also had our own scheduled time to see the penguins, where we learned more and got to take pictures with and hold the penguins."

We managed a basic 2-hr pass on the slopes for around $40/pp, but that included equipment, jacket, pants and the slopes. Hats and gloves are extra, but necessary as the building is pretty cold inside to keep the snow from melting. Couldn't really grade the snow, but it wasn't too icy or slushy. Didn't really care, we were in the largest indoor ski place in the world. That's classic."

We wanted to do unlimited zip-line, the penguins, and park. The penguins were super cute, but short. My kids loved that the penguin jumped on their lap. The snow rides were a lot of fun for the kids and us also. Understand that this is not about the rides, it is about the experience of being inside freezing while it was 113 degrees outside. NOTE: IT IS COLD!!!!!! We are a skiing /snowboarding family and we have never experienced cold like this. If you are going, you might want to bring an under-layer. The jackets and pants provided are like a shell. Also, bring a Hat! They do not give hats. My husband bought him and myself a hat (Total 30 dollars). We got the their \"really good gloves\" free with our package, but they were not warm. Not much lines (August) and the zip-line was fun. AGAIN: This is not about the rides. It is a about the experience. If you go in knowing this, you will think it was worth the money."

All clothing is supplied as well as ski boots and rubber boots (if you choose not to ski). Loved the toboggan and ski lesson. (I didn't realise skiing was so difficult). Even enjoyed the ride in the chair-lift. In hindsight I would pay extra for the waterproof gloves as once the material ones get wet my fingers started to get uncomfortably cold. Also got some great photographs from professional photographers who are snapping away all day. Would definitely go again. Great bonding session with my daughter."

We did enjoy seeing the attractions and activities and were impressed with how enthusiastic the staff were and their knowledge of the facility I guess if you want to have a cool down in the heat of Dubai then this is the right place to do it! I was suitably freezing in there, but soon thawed out within minutes of the Dubai Sun.Personally I would recommend Ski Dubai due to the authenticity and novelty of the complex"

Good ski school. A thousand times better than a dry ski slope. It's never going to be the Alps. The mid-way coffee shop is ok for hot chocolate.Down side. The kids were in ski school. We went in too. At the end of ski school they weren't released to us until they went outside the slope and handed their gear in. So if you want to ski with the kids at the end of their week, they want you to pay twice. Surely a nice little grad present would be an extended last session so families could ski together to see what the kids have learned?To watch the kids in there, you can go to the Cheesecake Factory, TGI Fridays or the bar upstairs near the Kempinski Hotel. There is no ski Dubai viewing area."

I played with my kids in the games together having fun feeling as a family experiencing little adventure we are not used to go through before but it was Great.The clothes provided us not enough to protect from the -3 cold place inside, so I recommend you to wear long sleeves and more than one cloth under the jacket. The gloves is not that quality to protect from snow so you have to purchase water proof gloves or bring yours. I found that socks are very light so we had to wear 2 socks and we were feeling cold also. I found my skiing cloth which j bought from the Alb mountains in Italy is very warm but this free cloth provided is very light and not not preserving the heat of your body. Even though you had to go in and out the skiing place to warm up and go back again several time.But we all love it and will go again soon running from the burning sun here."

It is not cheap but if you use 'The Entertainer' it helps. For those who ski/board, the run is very short and the black non existent but there is a small park. For non skiers there is still the option to ride the chair lift and do a variety of activities which look fun (never actually did any except the toboggan (hard and bumpy!). These all cost extra (except the toboggan) - a pass would make this economical and be a fun way to be in the cold but not get bored (just walking around inside seems a little boring).We took the kids to see Father Christmas here (Dec 2015) and it was AMAZING. Santa looked so real my kids were completely dumbstruck and there was a lovely toboggan slope that kids young and old could enjoy until they got too cold. We all had hot chocolate and it was insanely sweet but warm so we enjoyed it.TIP The 'warm' clothing you get given on entry isn't warm at all so take more layers to go underneath. You need to take your own gloves/hats although kids get given helmets."

My son generally isn't a daredevil so I thought he would hate it but he actually loved it, and based on the success of the week, will continue him with weekly lessons. He had two instructors who didn't initially seem that warm with young kids but over the week they built up a great rapport and had really got to know the group. Few suggestions for improvement: When booking the camp online, it only gave you three options for beginner, intermediate and advanced. Apparently there is also the 'discovery' class which is for real beginners where they learn to snowplough, how to stop etc and my son probably should have attended that class before the beginners camp. Would have been useful to have that information online ahead of time. Re: all the paraphernalia they need, again would have been good to get an automated email from the system saying this is what your child will need and this is what we will provide and this is how the week will work. Just to help the parents be more prepared and on top of things. Aside from that - it was well organised and run. Nice little touch on the last day was parents were allowed inside to watch and kids given hot chocolate on the slopes at the end of class which they really enjoyed. All in all would highly recommend for small kids and big kids / adults!"

For Kids I would say, will have a great time. My 10 Year old had his best time enjoying the activities, till he started feeling cold. We enjoyed the experience of the place more than any of the activities. The coffee shop in the snow which is on the ski slopes is only open for those who have opted for ski lessons or full day package, which I felt was a let down. Those who just want to enjoy the cafeteria and not want to do any activities will not get any thing to eat or drink inside. You will have to go out for food and drinks and enjoy the view from behind the glass window. Price : Its very expensive for the kind of activities offered inside. Its now worth spending if you have enjoyed the real snow else where."

Off you go to learn skiing with private tution if required or take on the slope your self. Pricing seems like any ski slope. Definately worth viewing as a tourist attraction also. great shopping complex with everything. money exchange, carre four etc."

When working out what tickets we needed to purchase for our family we found a lot of conflicting information regarding our 2 1/2 year old and the need to buy him a ticket. When we arrived they admitted that there was different information, however advised us that any child 2 and over has to have a ticket. Once that was resolved it was all uphill from there. The ski shop where you get gloves were very helpful and accommodating. The winter clothes they provide were great for the family. Make sure you leave plenty of time to get all your gear on, plus helmets for kids under 13. Our kids loved simple things of doing snow angels, but also loved the tubes and Zorb balls. All round it was great fun for all."

However, we were a group of 3 and the two others in my group had skied a few times before. I could keep up with the basics of moving around, but as the instructor started moving on to more advanced stuff like actual skiing, I started lagging behind. Instead of giving me special attention like one might expect, the instructor decided to stick with the two girls who could already ski. And just decided to yell at me from a distance and tell me that I was doing everything wrong. Towards the end he proceeded to joke about stealing our phones while we asked him to take pictures of us. Not funny.Also if you have a local with you, ask them if they have any promotions going on. We were able to get a decent discount because one of us had a particular local bank card.The other rides were quite fun and the penguins were really cute. Although it seems very commercial. e.g.\"Who would like to touch the penguins?\"*little kid raises hand*\"Well for that you have to buy the penguin encounter!\"Poor little kid."

However, that said - it was a very surreal experience standing in Dubai freezing our butts off in snow! We did the stair lift and then played about with the other winter games that were available.We awaited the penguin March, however that was a bit disappointing as only 2 penguins came out to see us.

I am not an expert in skiing but I can go on the high slopes without problems. Except the lift. After going up with the extremely slow lift I have decided to take the small one that you hold between your legs. My friend just felt down in the middle of the way while I reached the end but there was no one from the park there to advise us of the moment that we should remove the lift from between our legs. I was apparently too slow and as an result I was thrown over a bump of ice, crashing my hips against and hitting my head on the ground. Scared after the hit and worrying for my physical integrity I was crying on the floor and it took a while until someone came and helped me. Of course after that I wasn't able to ski as before and my experience was basically cut in half.It is a lot of fun and I would definitely go back there because i really enjoy skiing but the experience would have been much better if I felt a little bit more safe and the staff would be more attentive."

This really is a place for all Ski and Snowboarding fans, the largest indoor snow park in the middle of the desert, you just do not realise how big this place really is till your inside, it has a 1/4 mile from the top of the slope to the bottom runs and there are many different ways you can go from the top to the bottom, you then get the luxury of taking a chair lift where you can get off half way and ski or snowboard back down or stay on board and go right to the top where you really get an idea of how big this place really is. There is also plenty for the little one as there is a snow park where you can have fun with people who do not want to ski or snowboard, there is all sorts for them to do plus you can pay extra and meet a penguin, have a hug and have photos taken. One thing I must point out there is no where for anyone to sit to be able to watch people come down the ski slope unless you pay for an indoor pass that allows you to watch at different locations so unlike the UK where there is a restaurant at the bottom of the slope here there is not, at the bottom is a hotel and many different restaurants where you may be lucky to be seated in view of the slope but they do expect you to eat and drink so if you have anyone in the party who does not like snow and just wants to watch there can only look over the snow fun area and not at the slope itself unless you pay to enter."

There are penguin shows where they allow you to be around the penguins and touch them. The clothes, hand gloves, shoes are to be taken from the park itself but one should always carry children warm clothes so that they are more. Protected in 2-3 layers of clothes. After few hours the cold becomes difficult to handle so kids enjoy in warm clothes. To summarise, it's a fun experience for elders and kids!"

The first thing you notice driving up is the non-sequitor architectural element sticking out of the roof of the mall. Like what were they thinking?!! But then you find out... Ski Dubai is the real deal, with surface quality that will truly surprise and please. Full-gamut rent-and-ski packages just in case you thought you were touring in a desert or something. Great way to tune up for a trip to the frozen north."

So I decided to visit Ski Dubai. She liked it too much, maybe most in the whole list of Dubai visit.Felt that we should have stayed there more 2 hours but had other plans.Activity Info:- We were inside Ski Dubai for 2 hours and did mos of the activities (Snow Fun, Giant Ball, Mountain Thriller, etc) inside which comes with Super pass including Chairlift ride by which you feel like you are in Simla north India.Facilities:- They provide you enough cloths to keep you warm with some charges.- They provide you locker if needed to keep your belongings with some charges.- You can take pictures on your own, their professional photographers also take pictures of yours but the prices were way to high for me so skipped it. Just seen taken pictures in display and that's it !Reaching there:- This is inside Mall of Emirates (Crazy huh? Snow Park in the middle of Desert inside Mall)- Dubai is easy to roam around using metro and Mall of Emirates is one of the stop in the route."

The rental gear is pretty bad, but it's a couple of hours, you can deal. There are a lot of beginners, but it isn't too hard to avoid them if you know what you're doing. We bought the pass for 2 hours, but stopped after an hour. I think it's advertised as 5 runs, but it's really 1 run. It took me about 25 seconds to go from the top of the \"expert\" run to the end.If you're in Dubai, it's definitely worth visiting. Just keep in mind it's not Tahoe in California nor the Alps."

They have the slowest, most ignorant, rude staff I've ever experienced. They were standing around chatting endlessly while we were waiting in line to get our disgusting second hand used school p.e kit type equipment. Then it comes to light that after paying 50 pounds for entry and hire, they then try and sting you for an extra 30 dirham for a locker, more money for gloves, and then to top it all off, have one clueless person on the ski fitting taking forever and a day to serve a line of about 50 people. It was an hour before we got into the place after we arrived, tried to get our money back and were just dismissed by the manager who went to absolutely no effort to even try and understand out frustration. The whole slope was full of little children and young kids skiing around like headless chickens with no experience, crashing into people and causing a general nightmare on the slope. There was no control, nobody knew what they were doing, and the snow was like wet Sherbert. And this is all coming from a very experienced skier.My advice if you actually ski and have skied before is to stay well away and save your money. Plenty of better things to do in Dubai. My girlfriend was reduced to tears after falling over and having a kid ski into the side of her stomach so avoid a waste of a day and don't go !!!!"

On the other hand, the amount of electricity this place consumes must be astronomical. They\u2019ve created a freezer the size of a tall building. And they\u2019ve done it in the crazy-hot Arabian desert. Gotta wonder how that is good for the planet. Maybe not great, but if it keeps some people from flying to the Alps it may not be as bad as it first seems.Anyway, we're not regulars, but we\u2019ve been here twice, both times because of the kids. My daughter wanted to go to Ski Dubai for her birthday, so we booked her and a friend some ski lessons. Ski Dubai is great for teaching kids to ski. It\u2019s our only viable option to prepare the little ones for eventual outdoor skiing. The instructors are very professional and are good with children.However, if you already know how to ski, Ski Dubai will be way too small for you to take seriously. If you don\u2019t spend all of your time falling down, it takes just one minute to ski down the slope. So it really is just for kids and beginners.There is also a kid\u2019s play area which doesn\u2019t involve skiing. My 5 year old son didn\u2019t want to ski but he absolutely loved the other activities. Kids growing up here don\u2019t get to see snow so it is nice for them to have that experience. Sometimes we adults forget how much kids love to play in the snow.The crowd, the lines (or should I say lack thereof since many people don\u2019t bother to queue), and the general confusion of getting all the gear together is a bit of a headache. But all in all, it\u2019s a unique experience, and of course it\u2019s one that can only be found in Dubai."

            "review": "Perfect Climate Every Day!. My husband, my parents, and I went to Dubai in April 2016. My husband loves to ski, and rarely gets the opportunity, as we live in Florida. Long before we booked our trip to Dubai, he learned about Ski Dubai, which is where the obsession began. \"What do you want to do in Dubai?\" I would ask while we were planning our trip. \"Ski,\" was about the only answer I ever got. So expectations were high when we got to the Mall of the Emirates. Yes, Ski Dubai is in a mall. This is great for parties that maybe aren't all interested in going to a winter wonderland, because there is plenty for them to do nearby at a warmer temperature, even if it's just watch at the three-story windows into Ski Dubai. Our expectations were well rewarded! There are several experiences available at Ski Dubai, including skiing, snowboarding, tubing, tobogganing, a penguin interaction, and zip-lining. There are different tickets for different experiences, packages, and lengths of time. Whatever you choose, cold-weather wear is included (socks, shoes, and snow suit), though hats and gloves are not. Come prepared or purchase (both can be gotten for a decent price and make a nice souvenir), as Ski Dubai is kept at the ideal -2 degrees Celsius. You can rent a locker for a reasonable price and take things out and put them into it as many times as you need. Being less coordinated, my parents and I opted for the zip-line experience. This allowed us two runs down the Snow Bullet zip-line in the middle of the frozen environment. We took the ski lift up to the middle level where the very nice attendants outfitted us with harness and safety gear. The zip-line is side-by-side, so you can go in pairs and race, if you so choose. The zip-line feels very safe and is a great rush! When we were done with our two runs, they didn't kick us out of the snowy area, and we would have been allowed to stay in the snow for (I believe) as long as we wanted. Seeing as how it was -2, we didn't hang around for too terribly long, allowing my husband to finally get to skiing. His report of skiing was that conditions were great. We had gone to Alaska the month before, where conditions were slushy one day and icy the next, so the steady, well groomed slope was a pleasant change. He said that there was little traffic from other skiers, so he had a nice clear path down from the top most of the 2 hours he skied. There is a chair lift (which my parents and I enjoyed), but the speed is pretty leisurely, so if you are looking to maximize your time, the T-bar is the way to go. It's a little awkward at first, as my husband reports that you have to tug on the bar to get it going, but you are standing on grating that doesn't allow much movement on skis while you do this. So be prepared to hustle a little the first time you go up the T-bar. Bottom line: go play in the snow in the desert! Whichever experience you chose, it will be a wonderful, memorable experience.

Warm clothes and gloves etc are available at Dubai ski shop. There are local and continental restaurants located right outside Dubai ski. Have fun with the family."

            "review": "Ski Dubai!. We pre booked using Attraction Tickets website and paid for 2 hours pass. It was great to experience a taste of skiing on a summer holiday as I hadn't been for a couple of years. My only gripe would be the chair lift does take a while to get to the top however the 'drag' lift to the left is much quicker. This is pretty steep however so maybe not best for beginners. My girlfriend has been skiing once before for a week and managed to come down from the top so not as steep as it look from the bottom but still a great thrill and refresher for the slopes! It was pretty quiet too, the majority of people were either having lessons at the bottom or watching the penguin show. A great experience and something you should definitely try if you're in the Mall of the Emirates"

It costs around \u00a345 per person (for two hours which is plenty of time) which includes skiwear and equipment EXCEPT ski gloves so take your own. If you've never skied before then this is not for you ( in terms of trying it out without lessons!) - in fact you have to self declare your ability level. The slopes are suitable for anyone who has been skiing for at least one week anywhere in the past and the slopes are broadly red/blue. The snow is perfect and the runs are very long for an indoor slope. There are button/drag lifts and a chairlift - there is even a cafe halfway up. They have a green/beginners slope, a short bobsleigh run and some penguins! I'm sure you will be able to have lessons if you have never skied before but I have no idea how much that would cost. I loved this place and will go back whenever I find myself in Dubai."

We had an entertainer super pass voucher so I only paid for one person for my daughter and I. We also paid 40 dhs for a locker which is refundable once you are done using it and you return the key card to the counter. After reading some of the reviews mentioning that it can get really cold and the sock provided are quite flimsy. We decided to bring some extras. The park provides the shoes, socks, gloves and winter suit. If you are not used to cold climates like us, bring extra scarf, bonnets, ear muffs. It is -4 degrees inside. Suits do not have any pockets so make sure that you wear jeans or trousers with pockets where you can keep your key, mobile phone and other small valuables. The suit does not really give that much heat so wear something warm underneath the suit. We just came from Atlantis Resort the day we went to Ski Dubai hence we have 2 knapsacks and other carry ons. The lockers provided does not really fit much but if you take the corner ones. they provide much bigger storage space compared to the regularly situated lockers. Lockers no. 101 and 104 If I can remember are corner lockers. I would have to thank the lady guard in Ski Dubai for that great tip. We were able to get a peek at a penguin who was about to go a meet and greet so lucky us. If you don't want to pay extra to see them, be watchful as they may pass you by. The park I think also let them parade in the snow park at several different hours in a day so take note of their schedule. We tried the bobsled where you lie on a flat sled and slide on ice. You need to cross your arms on your chest or else you may risk of breaking them on accidentally with the ice walls. It is also very fast and takes sharp turns, be careful with your head and make sure your camera is secured before doing. Otherwise, you may also break them in the process. Next, my daughter did the tubing where she got tossed on a slope while sitting on a rubber tube; it was really fast and the attendant made the tube go on circles; really fun but can get dizzy upon getting up. You will aslo have to get your on rubber tube from down the slope and bring it up. We didn't try the zorb ball unfortunately especially my daughter who just came from the tubing. We rode the chairlift which gave us an aerial view of the whole park. It was really nice to see pro skiers. The chair sits 4 but there is height requirement for children.While it was an exciting ride, I was scared as hell the whole time, me being afraid of heights and wished that I have not joined my daughter. Her giggling while on air also did not help much as the chair was also moving. Make sure to give that big smile when you approach the gentleman taking photos. We did a stopover at the Avalanche Cafe up the slopes. View was great. It was like having your hot chocolate up in the mountains. Sadly, the food is just ok. Not much to rave about. After that it was back to the chair lift to go back to the main park. An hour or so in the park would be sufficient unless you are there for the ski lessons or you are already a pro skier. I couldn't imagine staying for more than 3 hours in the park. Lastly, dont forget to take your photos from the booth. They cost 150 for 2 and soft copies can be immediately posted in your social media account or sent to your email. TIP: Check Entertainer for a voucher before you visit.No reservation required unless you are coming with a big groupCome early morning or do it on a weekday, otherwise expect a crow especially during weekends. Bring scarf, bonnet and ear muffs. Wear something warm underneath"

Get all dressed up and cozy and hit the indoor slopes. They have everything you need except gloves and warm hats although helmets are also available. The system in place makes it for a good flow from the check-in, to rentals, locker, ski slopes...all very good. If anyone wishes to take some lessons, if booked in advanced it's still possible. I have to say that if you are a beginner it's the best, not too steep and just relaxing to ski down. If you are more advanced, you will get bored as you could probably be hitting the bottom of the slope in a minute or so. Nevertheless a great activity to do and feel the cold in your blood...pretty refreshing and invigorating."

If you are there to ski, 2 hours is all you will need as there is a beginner hill, an \"intermediate\" hill and a \"black diamond\" hill. For real skiers, the intermediate and the black diamond are really stretching those definitions. It is a novelty and after 2 hours, you probably will have done enough skiing. All clothing and equipment is included in the the $58.00, which is a pretty good deal. We also found it very organized and automated, but it was a low season and in the morning, so it was not crowded. Do not wear summer clothing! Bring at least some long sleeved top for warmth and lose pants to wear under the outerwear that is provided to you. The interior is kept at 22 degrees, which is chilly after 2 hours. The gloves are really necessary. Hats are optional.For kids, there is a small luge, sledding, bouncey balls in plastic and a zipline, along with the penguin meeting. However, at 22 degrees, most kids will probably be ready to go after a couple of hours."

We had a lesson booked but we're not given any direction of what to do. No step by step guide and to be honest the staff aren't very useful. We finally had our lesson with an instructor called \"smiley\" whom was not very smiley at all!!! Bearing in mind we paid to learn how to ski after several attempts of the smaller slopes and me falling over I was asked to ski lower down the slopes bymyself!!! Being neglected for the last 30 mins of the lessons!!! I paid the same price at the 4 other attendees but was not given the same attention. Also bear in mind half of the lesson was taken up by us waiting for other non lesson children flying down the slopes even though they weren't meant to be In our area. The staff struggle with discipline and allow locals to do as they wish. It's a mess! I would not recommend it or ever go again!!"

Everyone who worked there made the experience great. Purchasing tickets was easy (we did the 2 hour ski pass). Then we proceeded to get our gear. Once we changed, we got fitted for our boots, bindings and skis. They had a cool area where you fill out some information and step on a platform, so everything is fitted right to you. The weirdest experience is taking an escalator up to the skit hill, in your boots! Before you go in, you grab your poles. They have an RFID scanner that scans a card and tells you how many minutes you have left on the slope.There are basically three ski hills that you can choose from and one real chair lift. As a skier, you can take the chair lift about 2/3 of the way up and ski down. That's the beginner(ish) hill. You can keep going to the top and have two options: one is the black diamond and one is a little easier. There are a few obstacle parks in there too. We never had to wait for more than one group to get on the chair lift and if you don't want to wait, there are drag lifts that take you right to the top even faster.They also have some winter games, a zip line and penguins.This is a MUST DO in Dubai. I would definitely do it again if I came back."

Some areas for improvement :- Make sure the ski boots are done up when they are given out to the guests.- Staff need to be more welcoming and friendly in the areas where they interact with guests.- If staff are asked a question by the guest, they should try their upmost to help the guest.Poor service on the most basic levels, whenever we interacted with a staff member we were met with miserable unhelpful staff, that being said we could have been unlucky in who we came across, but a little customer service training would not be a miss. And some equipment maintenance and general respect for the product being offered would turn this 1 star review into a 5 star review.I would tell any keen skier to visit Ski Dubai, its a must see attraction, but it could be 10x better than it is with some staff training.

The website wasn't the easiest the use, you need to create an account in order to be able to finalise the booking but there was no promt to tell you this. It didn't tell you how far in advance you'd need to arrive, unfortunately we ran late and only arrived 10 minutes before the lesson was due to start but had no idea that this was not enough time. You need to allow 30-40 minutes, but no indication of this was given when booking. It's also unclear where you go for skis, boots or where to meet your instructor. The lesson itself was good, the instructor excellent and we had a great time. Once over it isn't clear where you put your skis or clothing, also don't forget to take your ski pass out of your jacket and post it in the booth on your way out to get your 20AED refund on it."

Off we went and so it began, the guy was really patient and he could spot from a mile away who needed a bit more attention and 'teaching' and who would be a natural - unfortunely I was one of the ones who needed a bit of extra attention! ... but he worked very gradually and slowly introduced the next step ... by the end we were up the top (which isn't right at the top, this is a designated learners area) I still need a lot more working on but as a first attempt I felt really comfortable and left feeling confident for my next lesson!!My partner went off snow boarding while I was in my lesson and he said it was really good for an inside venue!!Penguin encounter was my favourite - I have reviewed this separately :)"

I have to say that our arrival there was not as anticipated and this all because of the lack of organization. As we were waiting in the Queue and waiting just like everyone else until our turn came, this Indian family of 10 if not more jumped in front of us and this was disrespectful. I looked at the staff in the counter thinking that he will talk to them and I had an angry look but he gave no regards. Therefore, I had to step in and speak to them and the staff \"Mohsen\" I believe this was his name just kept quite and actually he wanted to serve them! After I talked to them they did not go back they just stood next to me and I was so angry and just resumed with purchasing the tickets so I could get out of there.Then we went to pick up the outfit and for my surprise the same thing happened but with another Indian family. I was so upset that those came from another closed raw and jumped in front of us. When the staff there saw that I did not like what just happened she \" A Filipino girl\" asked them to move out and wait in the queue just like everyone else.Lockers were so dirty and water everywhere and smelled bad. But once you are inside then it is worth it. The staff inside are so much helpful, friendly and organized. Everything inside is ordered despite some people who still don't respect the lines but the staff inside are firm but respectful. I really like the place but I won't go there on a Friday."

Compared to the $125 lift ticket prices and most of the US western resorts which obviously doesn't include any of your equipment or attire. In contrast the cost at Ski Dubai was approx $80 which included lift tix, all equipment, ski coats and pants, socks, gloves, helmet, etc."

Imagine the difference in the Summer from 50C to 0C!Ski Dubai is located inside the Mall of the Emirates. On the ground level the entrance has a restaurant area, St Moritz in the style of an alpine lodge with blazing TV screen log fires. Then there are a range of shops selling mountain and ski equipment. There are viewing areas where you can see most of the slope and watch the regular penguin attraction through glass for free. Allow plenty of time to visit. We left it a bit late and felt rushed. You can limit your visit to a walk around which seemed to be very popular with locals or you can pay for a penguin experience or toboggan run plus zip wire. There are ski lessons and it looks like it could be a genuinely great place to get your first ski/board lesson.We decided on the 2 hour ski which is for experienced skiers. The time doesn't start until you swipe your pass at the entry gate before the (full sized ski lift) so don't rush. After 2 hours the swipe gate wont allow you any more access.Getting set up is a bit chaotic but you need to queue to pay and then take your pass and self-register at a kiosk. Helpfully, there's an integrated weighing scale. Then move to to the clothing/boot counter where they issue an outer jacket/trousers. I imagined that they'd be insulated but they're only one layer of nylon. I only had a T-Shirt underneath but was fine. Finally, you can get skis issued. There are helmets for kids. Ski Dubai provide everything except gloves. You can buy fleece inner gloves in the shop for \u00a35 but I think you could do without at a push. The snow isn't at all icy so in the worst case I don't think you'd hurt your hands if you fell.You can add a locker to your pass which works by swiping the pass. It could be convenient.The slope itself is huge. It's in a two stage L shape. Ride the chairlift to the top and there's a slightly steeper to the right claimed to be a black. Probably not. When we visited there were some decent youngsters practicing slalom. The runs down were long enough to get in 8-10 decent turns and the snow was really forgiving - like cream cheese. On the way out don't forget to put your pass into a machine that returns your deposit as cash."

We arrived bout a ticket were I was to ski for two hours and my brother who in 13 to go on the zip line and the little play area (we were very unknown to how kid friendly this place was) so we went into the ski dubai part and no signs, directions or instructions as to what to do. So we guessed we needed shoes and the outfit so we search to find where people were going. When we found it we asked for the suit and shoes and where to go to change and so they pointed us in a direction then left us to our own devices, so we got changed in open space (we didn't have to take anything off other than outer layers) then we were told before we had a locker, as there were about a hundred lockers we had to search around for a while to find one. After I realised I need skis and from being skiing before I knew they needed you weight and height to give you the right skis so I saw where people were getting the skis and went over, I waited for about half am hour for a family to get their skis as they kept changing the sizes and what not so after waiting for half an hour (being British) I get pushed infront of (I found this extremely common in dubai as no one here likes waiting when they are going to end up in the same place within a matter of 30 seconds) and so I waited again then I asked what to do and was pointed towards a machiene so I went to the machiene and without me realising it was weighing me infront of all these people where i felt so self conscious and jumped off, after getting a piece of paper saying my weight hight and level of skiing I was I went back to the skis man and waited another 15 minutes then I finally got my skis then spent about 10 minutes finding the entrance! After all the cafuffle I finally found the snow and I found the whole experience amazing as I love skiing but my brother first got told to go down the ski lift the first time he went up to use the zip wire and so I went up with him the second time and made sure he got onto it then after his second go he was told you can only do the zip line twice so he was forced to stay at the bottom and go on the small activities where when buying the ticket we were unaware of what they were and they ended up being for children under the age of 7 so he did them and found them boring and not so fun. So after I used about an hour and a half of skiing we both left in the hope to upgrade my brothers ticket to ski with me but to get a ticket you had to get undressed again and take everything away and so we ended up leaving early because for someone who hasn't skied before it us a disappointment unless you under the age of 7. But I personally found the skiing fun and enjoyable and impressive!"

Yea playing with snow,ice sleds etc are there but you really have to go through a lot of hassle of clothes etc and inside also there is a lot of queing and you have to trudge along your own tubes up the slope in some of the cases. there is a ski lift on which you are allowed one round which basically gives you an overview of the facility. On this attraction there is a zipline which you can mount midway but the same is chargeable & we did not do it as it was not a grea proposition with so many clothes on. To be honest we had gone to the atlantis on the first part of our tour and the attraction here seemed a scaled down version of the same with ice added to it. If you have not been to a ski world before than you can visit this place for the novelty part of it.Otherwise i would not recommend this over the atlantis or for that matter even a hummer safari.Snow in a desert is its only USP & take a call according to your time & budgets."

In the past 4 years, I have been to Dubai several times, and always wanted to check out the famous indoor ski slope but time and other things that needed doing always intervened. THIS time, we stayed almost next door to the facility and it was finally a chance to try skiing indoors in the desert.I didn't break anything, and had a fine old time.There seemed to be a lot of people checking in when I arrived, and I feared it would be crowded -- crowds and one very out-of-practice skier could have been a bad mix -- but most of them must have been there for the many other activities on offer -- there were perhaps a dozen people using the ski slope.The check-in process, and getting geared up, seemed overly complicated, but since it has been so long since I skied, that may have been due more to my unfamiliarity with a now-standard process.Be aware that gloves and a hat are expressly excluded from the gear you rent -- you are instructed that you will have to buy those. If you plan to wear a helmet, you can skip the cost of the hat, at least.For 100% artificial snow (natural snow being more than just rare in Dubai, much more so indoors) the surface was much better than I would have guessed, and after a few \"how do you do this, again?\" spills, I was able to ski safely and enjoyably, though I am sure inelegantly.Staff were pretty helpful and friendly -- particular thanks to the photo-guy, who came t our rescue when my camera battery died and took some specific shots for me. \"The thing about a dancing bear is not how well he dances, it is that he dances at all.\" Maybe there is some element of this at work here - it is not how great the skiing is in Dubai, it is that you can ski there at all! Still, the experience was enjoyable, memorable and makes for a good story. Worth the doing, give it a try.(And for non-skiers, check out the other c=activities offered, about which I cannot speak because I did not try them!"

I wouldnt say its an attraction for seasoned, professional skiers, but if you go just for the fun of trying something unusual and skiing in massive fridge, located in a massive mall in the desert, with penguins then its worth a try. The ski lift is a little slow but the slopes are surprisingly longer than expected for a ski slope in a mall. I would recommend to dress very warm as you dont have the sunshine. Equipment can all be rented including the ski suit."

All I wanted to do the whole time was to ride all of these things again, again and again. The best part is when I answered one of the questions in the show and I go to touch and take a picture with a penguin . That was so awesome. My brother kissed the penguin. I really recommend that you go there. Make sure that you watch the show and answer the questions that they ask. I will tell you one of the question they asked, what are the types of penguins that we have here?"

Temperature is really low (-4 C) but the ticket provides free suit, shoes, and gloves. I would recommend that you pay a little bit extra for an upgrade of the gloves (better quality), this is done once you are there in the store. I bought a snow power pass which includes access to several rides at the center and also I booked a penguin encounter which allows you to see two types of penguins. For the penguin encounter, cameras are not allowed, but they take several pictures of you and the penguins, you get to hug them and kiss them. It's an awesome experience, plus part of the ticket price goes to an organization that helps the penguins. Also if you don't get to book the penguin encounter activities you can see the march of the penguins every two hours from 2 to 6 pm. The staff provides interesting facts about the penguins and if you are lucky you can go and kiss one of them. If you feel to cold, you can get outside to changing rooms so you can warm up and then come back to the snow when you are ready. This place is really fun! Even if you don't know how to ski you can have a lot of fun doing some other things, such as slides and going up with the lift chairs and enjoying the white view. Awesome place!"

And once on the slope the lift operators often hide inside where it is warm rather than actually help the skiers. Even the service in the cafe was unfriendly and slow. Something is really wrong at this attraction. Until they get it sorted I would recommend avoiding it, especially if you are a family. I should add that this is completely out of character for all our other experiences in Dubai, which have been a real joy."

It was good to try, my only complaint was it was not very well organised as they let people who could hardly ski use the lifts and go to the top and there was one girl who was out of control she could have caused a very serious accident and someone could have been badly hurt. I was lucky as I am a very experienced skier and could avoid and watch out for that person, but others could not have.

Our instructor was excellent and quickly identified that one of our party was more advanced than the others so pushed her on to bigger and better things quickly which I know she appreciated. My friend loved her experience which was controlled, organised and lots of fun! She is now looking to practice more in her home country and looking to take a snowboarding holiday. At 150 AED for an hour, with all your equipment included, I think it is pretty good value. The only issue I have is when you go, you have to be there at least 30 minutes before your lesson starts to make sure you can queue for your equipment, get changed and to the ski school on time. The queues for equipment can sometimes be massive so it's a bit hit and miss what time you turn up at. If driving to MoE, parking can also be an issue! Overall, a great experience when visiting Dubai, or indeed if you live there!"

The prices do not justify the attraction, people will go to it to tick it off the list of things done in Dubai. My advice would be to spend that money on something else, dune buggy, desert Safari etc. I would not recommend it."

It is quite expensive for a short experience but we are assured that some money does go towards penguin research. The downside is you can't take your own camera in so if you want photos of the experience you have to buy them. It was 100dhs for 1 photo or 300dhs (\u00a360) to have all of them available to download - we got 26 photos. We got the lowest level of experience so we got to meet 2 penguins - one Gentoo and one King penguin, there are other levels with increasing cost where you get to meet more. The penguins are clearly well looked after and the trainers really seem to care for them. You get a bit of a talk about each of the penguin types and also a chance to see the Gentoo penguin playing and running around - they were definitely my favourite!"

Ski Dubai opens at 0900hrs for payment and to get your gear sorted before the slopes open at 1000hrs. This definitely seems the best time of day if your going with Kids, especially the first hour where the slopes seem relatively empty. It is also worth checking in with them the day before to make sure they do not have any special functions like i experienced this week when 800 people arrived at the same time to use the ski lift and snow park.Be prepared for a little frustration in getting the boots and skis sorted out. The computer system that weighs you in is very annoying when its asks for phone numbers and emails which if you are a kid and do not have that info it will not let you move on. This information gathering is unnecessary. The paper also jams in the system which creates more havoc. I hope Ski Dubai will read this and go back to the old manual system.On the slopes. Although not the great outdoors in the Swiss alps it is still a good laugh considering your in the desert. The chair lift is quite slow but the button lifts at the side get you up to the top quickly. The cafe half way down is a great stop for hot chocolate and coffee. Have fun and just remember it for what it is, the best IN DOOR ski resort in the world. One last word of advice. There are lots of special deals for Ski Dubai from Cobone Deals, Entertainer and then Ski Dubai's own Specials. But make sure you read the small print carefully as not all is what it seems at first glance."

However, if you have a friend with you, who is willing to teach and hover over you, then hit the slopes directly, saying that you're an experienced skier. Just be careful that they have safety patrols inside, which may ask people to leave if they see novice or dangerous behavior (they will probably ignore you, if you visit during early hours on a weekday)."

Father Christmas was great (don't tell the kids) he was from North of England really friendly great with the kids. You get supplied with all the gear Thermal suit, boots, hard hats for the kids, and gloves, which you do need as it is very very cold inside. As pensioners it was the first time my wife and I had ever done Tobogganing well it's sitting on a small plastic tray and sliding down an incline in the snow great fun. Amazing in Dubai throwing real snow balls at each other hadn't done that for years. Then we had our free hot chocolate and watch the experienced skiers coming down the slopes. There are teaching classes for beginners. The ski lifts take the skiers to the top of the slopes which is quite high, it's just amazing. A real must to go will definitely go again when we go to Dubai later in the year."

It is quite an amazing concept and very well presented, with efficient processes and modern equipment. The interesting thing we found was that maybe only 10% of the people there actually skied or boarded, the rest just played in the snowpark and rode the chairlift. So the ski piste was not crowded at all. Our 4 year old had a couple of lessons, and the Instructors were very good, making it fun for her. Our older girl and I spent a couple of hours riding the chairlift and skiing down (about 6 minutes up and 45 seconds down!). The snow was very consistent and powdery. This may have been because we arrived early and finished our skiing by 2pm. We heard that it gets busier later in the day and the slope may get bumpier.The snowpark was great fun for kids with bob-sled, rubber rings down slopes, huge plastic balls that you sit inside while rolling down the slope, and even a cool penguin show.The hot chocolate at the Avalanche cafe halfway up the piste was excellent! Top Tip ..... Download the Ski Dubai app before you buy your tickets and you get a free Power pass with every 3 Power passes you buy ..... Good if you have a family of 4."

It is worthwhile noting that they do not provide beanies or gloves, but you can buy them. Personally, I didn't use gloves or a beanie and was okay, my hands were quite cold by the end, but it was bearable. They give you a free pair of socks, so if you bring your own socks, you could always use the socks they give you as makeshift mittens!I thought the quality of snow was excellent and the run was much longer than I was expecting. It was also much warmer than my other skiing experiences, because there was no wind!This would be a great place to learn to ski or snowboard or perfect our technique. The staff were very attentive and the only person I saw who appeared to be in pain when they fell had three staff members helping them up. You would never get that kind of attention on a real mountain! If you are used to speeding down mountains, you may appreciate the novelty of skiing in the middle of the desert, but won't be challenged.We got there quite early, at about 10am on a Monday and found it wasn't very busy at all. Later on it got busier and there were more people on the slope."

There is also a section for skiing (which may be paid)1) With a normal ticket, you are offered a jacket, trouser, gloves and shoes, which keep you dry. But the jacket is thin, so better carry your own sweatshirt or seater to wear inside the jacket to keep yourself warm. Also wear your own jeans/ trousers beneath the trouser that is provided. 2) Kids are given a free helmet for safety while they take slides in the park3) For women who cannot wear trouser and are in saaris, long coats are given (not sure if they are free)4) They also provide you with locker where you can keep you 1 small bag. But the locker is chargeable at around 25 to 30 dirhams5) There is small section for penguins, where you can see, touch and click pic with penguins. But is chargeable at about 175 Dirhams (I think per head)There is a small snack shop also inside the park, which is expensive. But once you come out, in the mall you will have enough options to eat out. There is a food court as well. For vegetarians, you can get mcdonalds/ Burger king veg burgers in food court as well."

For another 45 dirham, you can get a locker to put your shoes and other stuff.It is basically a beginner run at the bottom and intermediate/beginner run at top. It curves separating the lower and upper slope. Midway is the separation point and there is a cafe there. From outside the glass windows you only see the lower slope.It was fun, but because the run is so short, if your are an experienced skier you will get bored. Maybe it takes 7 minutes on the chair to get up there, and 1 minute to ski down. After awhile its repetitive and boring, there is no scenery like skiing in the mountains. So 2 hours is more than enough.If you are learning to ski, then 2 hours will not be enough."

Be warned its not the soft and fluffy snow either unless you get there early as with people tramping through the park hourly it soon becomes compact.

Super expensive and very crowded at the base. Skiing down the run is not so bad. Most people are at the base doing sledding, etc... We did pay extra to see the penguins. That was nice."

Like most indoor ski slopes, nearly all equipment is provided. what they don't provide (you have to pay extra) are gloves and hats! Their socks are also very thin so if you are planning to go here, bring your own.Equipment is well used, and I found the boots too wide, but for a sneaky ski for two hours, it was OK.This is the 1st indoor ski area I have seen with a 4 man chairlift! Only complaint is that it was soooo slow."

            "review": "Nice experience but horrible lesson. I've never gone skiing before; this is my very first time doing anything like this. I signed up for the Adult Discovery class, which is basically a crash course for beginners. In the class, there were two other girls who were familiar with snowboarding but wanted to try skiing instead. Throughout the entire class, the instructor was extremely fixated with them, and I think it was tremendously helpful to their case that they were already somewhat familiar with the snow. I was having an extremely hard time even moving around with my skiis, and tended to get to locations much slower than them. Occasionally she'd give them instructions when I wasn't around (I hadn't managed to reach the destination yet) and despite my concerns that I wasn't ready to ski down the top of the beginner slope, we did so because the two other girls in the class were already ready.As a result, I fell twice - the second being an extremely bad fall. I uprooted one of their signpoints that had been fixed into the snow, crashed into the ski lift, and caused the entire lift to come to a stop. After that I couldn't even get up. It was only after being humiliated did the instructor pay me slightly more attention.I'm going to put it this way; the facilities were nice and the environment was really cool, especially if you've never seen snow before, but I really did not appreciate how the lesson went after paying AED 160 for it. I had certainly started the lesson hoping that it would be fun; halfway through I just wanted it to end. I didn't pay so much money to feel embarrassed and sorry for the fact that I'd never done anything like it before. It would be masochistic to enjoy paying money for something that just consistently made you feel bad and terrible about yourself.I'm not trying to sound vindictive, just trying to give constructive advice - if you ever go for a class, especially a discovery class, it's preferable you do so in a group. Perhaps only then will you gain the instructor's attention, and have your concerns legitimized. Overall I'd say it was a fun experience; unfortunately eclipsed by a terrible lesson."

            "review": "The Snow Park part of Ski Dubai is lots of fun!. We aren't skiers, but wanted to see the crazy concept of a ski resort in a desert country, so we bought the \"super pass\" tickets, which include 1 ride on the ski lift and unlimited use of the zorbing (rolling down a hill inside a giant plastic ball), tubing, tobogganing, and bobsledding. These tickets do not include skiing or the zip line. It took 45 minutes from when we arrived to buy our tickets, collect our gear (they provide boots, thin socks, a ski jacket, and ski pants, and helmets for kids 13 and under), get dressed, and put our other clothes/gear into a locker (you can rent a locker when you buy your tickets - it's easy to use. We fit 5 people's belongings in 1 large locker). Once we were in the park, it wasn't too crowded (it was a week day) so we rode the chair lift first to get a view of the scope of the place and to watch people skiing and snowboarding down the hills. You can get off the lift at the top where there is a little snack bar. Then our kids did the zorbing (I had been worried about it but once I saw that it's a short, not steep hill and that the giant balls are kept in a track so they can't go wild, I wasn't worried.) It was a short ride and there was a long line so our kids only did it once. Then we all did the tubing (sliding down a hill in 1 or 2-person innertubes. There are guys at the top who spin you as much or little as you want so you can have a calm or wilder ride. It's a very short track, but fun, and you can get right back in line and go again - it moves fast. We also did the bobsledding, which was surprisingly long/fast (a little scary, actually!) compared to the other activities. After we were finished but before we left the park, we got hot chocolate at the snack shop near the entrance. In all, it was a fun afternoon! Our only complaint is that there are not enough signs to clearly mark where the lines are for each activity so it was a confusing and there aren't enough employees working inside the park to ask, so we wasted some time wandering aimlessly.Tips: it's cold in there so bring your own hat, scarf and gloves (they provide a free pair of fleece gloves you get to keep, which is a nice memento, but they aren't warm enough. You can pay 25 AED to upgrade to a pair of snow gloves or you can bring your own if you have them). And bring warm/thick socks since the boots aren't that warm and the socks they provide are very thin. Bring some money (if you want to buy a snack/drink inside) and camera inside the park with you. The only problem is there are NO pockets in the ski jackets/pants they provide so you have to stash things inside your clothes and then unzip to get to them, which isn't convenient.Note: you are required to pay a deposit of 20 AED per person for the key card. Before you leave, return the card to a key card machine and you get the money back."

The clothing is made from a very cheap material, I had no idea what to do with the equipment. After a five minute fumble, one of the Ski Dubai agents came to my rescue and started showing me how to wear the boots, etc.Then came the instructor and off we go to the snow. Even though the instructor was very kind and nice, he was just not trained enough on how to coach beginners and couldn't really teach us the basics and his English wasn't pretty good which meant an extra layer of miscommunication.I called it quits after 30 minutes of the cold seeping through the cheap material and the so-so coaching.I still believe that it's a good place for kids and maybe for adults who just wanna have fun and throw a couple of snowballs but I wouldn't really recommend it for adults who would like to learn how to ski."

Not so much skiing as more flying down a slope completely out of control A woman at the bottom taking pictures to sell later kept complaining to us that we were not stopping in time. She did not understand that trying to break on ice is just not possible when hurtling down a slope. Thankfully, there was a wall at the bottom that took care of my breaking needs (both stopping and bone breaking !).This venture was not cheap so not really for a budget traveller. The ski lesson prior to going up was hilarious with very little knowledge of any substance passed on. I'm sure that stopping in snow using the techniques shown work quite well. Not so much when you are on a slope designed for a stunt show.Having said all that. Go in the morning when the snow is fresh and I am sure the experience would be much better."

The slopes were perfectly maintained and you got all equipment including warm ski jackets. Its obviously nothing like real skiing but the experience is like a mini version with T bars and ski lifts to the top and real snow! Only an hour or two is needed skiing as the same slopes get boring if you are a good skier. Great place to learn though and great staff!!"

In Line of Dubai's Quest for being the World's Largest in architecture, This centerpiece of the Mall of the Emirates is the Largest Indoor Ski Resort for a Desert Country. You will not miss it as the Theme park is at the center of the Mall of the Emirates! Having a Ski Resort in a blazing desert is perfectly logical for Dubai, who aspires to awe the world in everything. This indoor ski resort features an 85-meter-high indoor mountain with 5 slopes of varying steepness and difficulty, including a 400-metre-long run, the world's first indoor black run, and various features (boxes, rails, kickers) that are changed on a regular basis. A quad lift and a tow lift carry skiers and snowboarders up the mountain. Adjoining the slopes is a 3,000-square-metre Snow Park play area comprising sled and toboggan runs, an icy body slide, climbing towers, giant snowballs and an ice cave. Ski Dubai is also home to a number of penguins who come out to play several times a day. Penguin encounters can be booked (although you will pay a separate price of AED 145 for a session with the penguins for 40 minutes plus the general admission for AED 200 for a total of 345 AED!) allowing the public to interact directly with the penguins. Winter clothing, ski and snowboard equipment are included in the price of admissionAdmission Price is:200 AED for adults (2 hours) and 170 AED for children less than 13 year old50 AED per 1 hour extensionFull Day Pass is 300 AED for adults and 240 AED for children less than 13 year oldINCLUDED IN THE PRICE- Jacket- Trousers- Disposable socks- Helmet for children up to 13- Skis, poles and boots or Snowboard and bootsNOT INCLUDED- Hat & gloves for hygiene reasons but can be purchased from the shop starting 10 Dhs- Locker rental is 20 Dhs and can be used by several persons- A ski pass deposit of 10 Dhs is required and will be refunded when returning the ticketFOR FIRST TIMERS:you need to get a ski lesson which includes being initiated to the equipment and basics of skiing or snowboarding for 1 hour and the price is different, at AED 150 for 1 hour for all ages, Group Lessons at 160 AED for 60 minutes.Opens: Thu to Sat 10AM-Midnight and Sun to Wed 10AM-11PM"

I enjoyed this part of the trip. My issue is with the \"snow\" (ice) burns I received from the trip and the help I did not receive. I was not wearing gloves (which are not required) and during my sessions I made contact with the snow several times with my hands. It was not until the next day that the skin around my knuckles experienced the burn from the ice at the park. This was the last part of my trip and I was on a flight back home the next day. I live in the U.S. and reached out to the company that runs the ski park and they would not refund me the money from experience nor offer compensation. They were not helpful and that is why I give the poor rating for this trip."

It is a very unique attraction and yes for those of us who live and feel real snow, the difference is obvious. However Ski Dubai is an attraction that has really been created with both the young and old in mind. It\u2019s a must to do attraction as they really have made it nice and I can imagine going in here from the 40C degree heat. Luckily we went over the xmas holidays and it\u2019s the best weather in Dubai at that time. We wanted to enjoy the snow park, chairlift but also meet the penguins \u2013 best decision. We read the reviews before we left for Dubai and the ski Dubai website is not the most amazing website so we thought we would see better offers and book something when we reached Dubai as we were living in a hotel inside the MOE so knew we could book something and then come back. We were amazed at the queue for ticketing purchase and we were like 10th in the queue and my wife decided to go out of the queue while I stayed in the queue and she made inquiries and found out that buying online would actually save us AED 20 per ticket and we would not need to wait in the queues but rather just go to a separate kiosk and cash in our tickets.We went for the Peng-Friend Encounter and booked it using my iPad at the hotel. As I warned the website is not amazing and after booking we screen shot the booking reference just as well as we never received an email. The website was either too busy with traffic. Nevertheless one could always log back in go in \u2018my account\u2019 section and see your booking. The bookings for Peng-Friend Encounter were sold off for the next 2 days \u2013 shows how popular these are. We showed our screen shot and receive dour tickets from the online booking kiosk which had no queues at all. We received a token each for free gloves from a shop which was right inside ski-Dubai and adults gloves were good but kids ones were more like mittens \u2013 can\u2019t complain they were free after all!!The prices are all on the website, Super Pass which is a must is AED 250 for an adult and a Child too, same price. The Power Pass includes the Peng-Friend Encounter and Super Pass so you enjoy the chair lift. The snow park has amazing activities for young kids including slides, rides, snowball and playing areas as well. We ended up spending 3 hours in this attraction until our feet and hands were numb so yes as advised by many, wear some warm clothes, thick socks as they provide rubbish socks. Ensure you have a woolly hat and good gloves. Snow boots are provided \u2013 just ensure you try them on as the staff giving these out seem to be making wild guess despite you giving your feet size.The Peng-Friend encounter is a unique experience and as experienced travellers not many places offer you to actually touch and kiss a penguin. Our kids went gaga and the trainers are really good and explain a lot about the penguins and some of the tricks that have taught these penguins. The Chair lift gives you an excellent way of viewing the whole ski-Dubai park and appreciate the structure and see skiers below \u2013 worth it for sure. Queues were horrendous but maybe because we went over xmas and it was peak holiday seasons. The staff are friendly and always happy for a chat \u2013 not easy doing their job at minus 4 for such long hours!"

Upon arrival they really don't explain what you are going to get. So we booked the beginner lesson finding out after the class was over we would never get to actually ski. It was a displeasure for me because I only took the class so my mom wouldn't have to take it alone. They then told me I had to pay for a separate ski lift. Which I felt like I just did all that for nothing. So if you go here make sure you understand exactly what u paying for."

It's like a snow adventure land for kids with sled runs (tame but suitable for little kudos) and snow slides. It is very very cold, they give you coats and boots and disposable socks but take your own warm socks, gloves and scarf and beanie or else you will only last a short while in the freezing temperature! Allow an hour with little kids, longer if you are properly kitted out with warm accessories. And wear long pants!"

Get some good thick gloves which is water proof and a thick socks if possible. The provided dress is good enough to protect our body from the low temperature. Go there with your family and enjoy skiing in desert. It is bit high in price but worth trying. you wont regret for sure !!!"

If you can ski, only buy the ski pass for the day ,you still get clothes and ski's you only need to buy or bring gloves. We had to change our pass one down graded to only ski this was the wiser decision. The other upgraded and never did any of the other activity as it is too busy with people who could not ski. The penguin encounter was included in the 500AED pass. My youngest said it was very cold and not worth it. He thinks buy the ski pass only if you can ski, you can use the lifts as many times as you like. They skied for 8 hours non stop."

The equipment you're given is third rate at best, the thermal gloves were horrible and we were continuously given the wrong boot size, so it took about 2 hours to suit up...before joining the long lines for the rides.

While the city outside cooked in 35 o C plus heat, the ski-slope glistened with artificial snow and kids wrapped up tight like parcels launched snowballs at each other. The piste is remarkably good and makes for easy turning and manoeuvrability. Ski Dubai was packed when we went in the afternoon but the crowds actually made for a cheerful atmosphere and a lively feel. Switzerland it's not- despite the fondue Matterhorn style restaurant at the bottom by the entrance- but every visitor to Dubai should scale these indoor peaks and schuss down into the future of winter sports' entertainment."

First of all, don't go in with the attitude you are skiing the Alps or Rocky Mountains and enjoy the experience for what it is...a novelty. It's a ski slope attached to a mall in the desert...get past that and you will love the experience. As with everything in the UAE it's over the top. My 20yr old son snowboarded and I skied. He is a novice to intermediate snowboarder and I've been skiing a looooong time and we both thoroughly enjoyed the experience. We bought the 2hr slope only ticket which was a perfect amount of time...realistically I couldn't see staying all day inside the area. However they did have other options for purchase to include a toboggan/luge run, penguin experience as well as a seated zip line. While the initial part was a little painful due to the long lines...initial purchase of ticket...line; getting fitted for boots and snow suits...line; getting ticket from kiosk with weight, skier ability etc...line; then taking ticket to pick up skis and get bindings adjusted....line! So we were worried it was going to be jam packed inside, however, we were pleasantly surprised. The longest we waited was about 5 minutes for the chair lift...then we got smart and bypassed the chairlift line and took the j-bar to the top. It took us about 6-7 minutes from turnstile scan into lift, lift to top, ski down scan again.Just seeing the logistics of the entire operation is worth going. Imagine getting everyone fitted in snow clothes, issuing skis or boards and then adjusting them to each person's weight and ability...quite the feat...the guys doing the adjusting were busting their tails the entire time and I commend the effort.All in all a wonderful experience...would I do it again...probably not...but a once in a lifetime thing, most definitely. Tip of the day...download the skidubai app and purchase your ticket beforehand, that will alleviate the first and longest line. I had a very hard time trying to purchase just a 2hr ski slope ticket online...had I known about the app, it would have saved us a considerable amount of time."

There are lots of games which are suitable for all ages, and I highly recommend you get the hot chocolate with marshmallows at the hut at top of the cable cars.If you are taking young kids make sure dress them in heavy clothes and have on two pairs of socks. Another nice trick is to upgrade your fleece gloves for the waterproof ones they will cost you a little more but will probably add on a couple of hours for the kids before their hands get too cold."

Those with a flair for adventure can ride the chair lift to the top and ski/snowboard down the slope. There are also lessons from qualified instructors for the beginners. (Allen is one of the excellent instructors who works here and did a wonderful job improving my daughters skiing skills)If nothing else just getting into the ski area to feel the sub-zero temperature and have a cup hot chocolate/coffe at Avalanche cafe is worth the price of admission. For those interested in learning how to ski, private lessons are recommended. They are expensive but worth it since you get personal attention and will learn faster. One suggestion to everyone who wishes to ski here, be early at the place since the formalities of collecting the gear and getting into it takes around 45 mins."

The main run from the top is long enough to get a couple dozen, decent sized turns in and there are enough moguls to keep the intermediate+ skier entertained. But I think Ski Dubai is best for the beginner. It\u2019s the perfect controlled environment to learn how to ski. And there are some very good instructors available for this purpose. You don\u2019t need to ski to enjoy Ski Dubai. There are plenty of areas for kids to play in the snow. And adults too. Among the best venues Dubai has to offer."

One of, if not the largest indoor ski resort in the world, and in a desert. It's worth a look. However the volume of mannerless tourists, combined with the surly staff just made the experience a little bit crap.Moronic people who don't watch their children, or who think the world clearly revolves around them aside, the staff at this facility clearly need a kick in the pants. Most look as though they are being made to work under threat of punishment. Very few, if any smiles from them made me feel like I want' allowed to have fun, and that I was actually making their life more painful by being there. Combine this with their need to sell photos and it gets a bit much.I also found that the staff were pretty clueless. Kids, and I mean as young as 6 through to 14, would push in line without a world from any supervising staff. The lack of manners and entitlement attitude of the kids was amazing. I said a few things after a while to them only to face blank stares from the parents and children alike.If you are going to Ski Dubai expect some rudeness from staff and other tourists and children. We went in the off-season (November). I can't imagine what this must be like when it is busy.I gave it 3 stars because if you ignore the rudeness from staff and others, you can have a decent time. I would have given it two stars if you factor in the Staff. If you will never ski, and will never go skiing, I would suggest this as a good experience and a cheaper alternative to a skiing holiday.The slopes can be crowded and if you haven't ski'ed before I would strongly suggest having lessons, especially for those who want to try snow boarding.Note to Ski Dubai Management: The staff need training in delivery of professional customer service."

The snow isn't real and trust me skiing on real snow and skiing on fake snow is different. For me it was hard to control my skis and there wasn't a big variety of slopes. There was one from experience which was probably a blue or a red run. But if you are an advanced skier this may be the place for you in Dubai, but I recommend that you don't take beginners or small children as a couple of years ago when I was 9 I was completely spooked by the experience and ended up in tears. Also I would really recumbent not doing this if you have never skied before, I would learn outside in real snow. But skiing is not the only thing you can do here. You can play with penguins or have a snowball fight or even go tobogganing. But unfortunately I only got the ski pass so I didn't have access to all the other attractions. To finish this on a positive note, it is a great idea to have ski runs all year round but it may not be enjoyed by everyone. But don't forget, there are other fun things to do there too."

The highlight is of course the penguin feeding, yes PENGUINS in Dubai!

There are 2 slopes which give you enough of run back to the chair lift or the drag lift, which is a lot quicker. The session last for 2 hours and this is plenty. When we arrived on a Friday at 11am it seemed very busy in the area to get equipment however the actual ski slope was quiet and most people were doing the activities for non skiers.

Ski Dubai - a huge snow area created in the desert which gives you chance to enjoy some time in snow for travellers who do not see snow regularly and skiing for those who are always in the snow.The trip needs to be planned a bit to avoid the additional cost and get maximum fun. Firstly do not go for any extra options if you are not from cold regions. Stick to general options and that too are enough.Full costume is provided except gloves and hat. So make sure you carry good woolen gloves and hat that covers head and ears. That will save your money. Make sure you go to the washroom before wearing the dress as it takes atleast 2-3 hrs till you remove the dress.There are slides, ballon rides, rope climbing for small children to adults. Just go for it without fear and it is fun. However elder people should avoid.The chair car is a must ride as it gives the entire view of the area and also see the experienced skiers go zip zap below you.Learn to ski depends if you have time.A totally different experience in the desert which we do not get very frequently and it gets fun-filled if you really get the courahe together to go thru the few slides."

Although I visited with adult friends I got to see many children enjoying the slope and the classes. I think it's perfect for families with children and couples looking for something to do together. Afterwards you can hit up one of the many restaurants at the mall and culminate a fun day out with perhaps a movie. My friends and I loved it and recommend visiting!"

Great slopes - our boys skied for 3 hours. We watched from a mid slope mountain caf\u00e9! All the kit is provided, although I would recommend taking a hat if you are 'watching' - it is very cold in there. A really fun morning. For little children, the mini play area looked fantastic - sadly we were all too big for that. Would recommend for all ages."

Don't have to worry about anything, pants, jacket, skis boots and poles all included. Snow quality is surprisingly great! With a constant -8 C the snow never ices up! Fun amount of things to look at.Live penguins under where you get on the poma lift. (there is a poma and a chair lift)Negatives, just like every ski area in the world there are the ski brats. The young local skiers that are there day in and day out. They feel they rule the place and try and cut in line all the time. If you are aggressive with them they back down. It gets cold! Better if you bring some clothing with you. I would highly recommend doing this! It is a lot of fun.Bring with you from home. A few warmer layers of clothing. A hat and gloves!!!! (if not you will want to buy one, not included in the rentals)Your own coat, but this is really not necessary as they will provide you one. A camera, you have to take a selfie on the slopes!"

But if it is your first time then it is very unclear and confusing where you are meant to go and when. Despite being sat waiting in the correct area, my son missed being taken out by his instructor because he didn't have a bib, which we had not been told we needed! Some staff were really helpful, too many not helpful at all. By the time my husband and son got out on the slopes I was really annoyed. Luckily, a spiked hot chocolate at Apres bar, overlooking the slopes solved that! My son, whose first experience of skiing it was, loved it! His small group lesson for an hour was perfect.

No Dubai would not have built it today, they are not that irresponsible and take a serious view on green issues. perhaps one day, when no one is looking they will quietly remove it, as it is surely a minor embarrassment now. the local can most surely afford to get to the alps if they want to ski.

The problem though is that the jackets that are provided are very thin and do not insulate well. One would never go skiing like this in the mountains. We could therefore not stay for more than an hour, despite having booked several activities, including skiing lessons. It was also super crowded in the play area at the bottom of the small hill. Skiing is nice I guess, but it is not advisable with small children, unless you are well prepared with winter clothing and do not just go in during a trip to the mall."

It's totally surreal knowing that it's hot and humid outside (95 F) but freezing inside. Great fun to people watch kids and parents playing in the snow especially those who probably didn't grow up with cold weather. They were having a blast."

Today a big pick up of smaller kids' classes with the \"expert\" slope essentially closed to other users which was disappointing. Whilst the dome is a novel attraction, but not cheap, the quality of kit is going through the floor. Skis are old and my body's seen more wax(which it hasn't, by the way) than the bases of the rental skis and the knives in my rental apartment have more edge. Bring your own rub on wax if you don't want to her to a halt on the \"powder\". Can live with the skis, but the boots! Had to come down 2 full sizes to get any wrap around sensation, as all boots have the insoles removed and a delightfully damp feel inside - someone else's feet or just the cleaning?! Time for some new gear guys or how about a premium rental element? Feels too much like cost cutting and a rigorous fleecing. If you can, at least bring your own boots."

This was just mind blowing.. snowboarding in the desert, who'd have imagined it?For 500 AED you get to experience everything Ski Dubai has to offer including kissing and cuddling penguins, hitting the slope, all gear and clothes hire and even lunch!There is only one run for snowboarding/skiing so if you're going purely as an avid snowsports person then you'll be wasting your time.However, if you're looking to discover something pretty cool with your family or friends, then you definitely need to visit.Chairlift, Ski Run, Zorb Balls, Zipline, Toboggans, Bobsledding, Penguin Cuddles and more. Definitely great value for money and a once-in-a-lifetime experience. I recommend you go early in the day as it gets busier later on.We arrived at 9.30am, which gave us enough time to get our gear and be the first people on the snow when it opened at 10am.We literally had the place to ourselves until around 10.30am. By midday it was noticeably busier but not packed. (This was on a Thursday so I don't know how weekends would be).The penguins were amazing to touch and cuddle but if you want photos of the experience then it gets more expensive as you can't take your own camera or phone in and it's an extra 110AED per photo that you buy."

I was dreaming about that day and it happened, 4th October I went to ride snowboard and I had an accident and surgery in the hospital later on, I fall down on the small but sharp slope when I was going out from the chairlift ,which can be dangerous for the snowboarders and for everybody !!!because platform which u reach on the top it goes smooth and flat like 3 miters and then that small but sharp slope !!!there was no one to assist , to help in case you will need it, like in the beginning there was staff , in the middle of mountain there was staff at least 2 person , just in the top one lady whom I called later on, but she was watching ppl who is coming from down to up but not for those one who is behind !!!whatever will happens she will not see it because it's in her back side !!!Be careful on the top of mountain!!! P.S. TOP management you have to make that slope smooth and flat even its not that big but it can be difficult for snowboarders who get used to fix only one leg with the board and you need at least one more staff on the top of the mountain!!"

You can book a visit with the penguins in Ski Dubai, a \"meet and greet\" if you will, where you can play with the penguins and even stroke the strange but adorable little fellows.You heard me, yep, you can stroke and play with the penguins. Are you booking it yet? You should be. Go book it now i'll wait for you.........Done? OK.So, you need to take something warm to wear as you will be going into their sub zero environment. They do provide a ski suit thingy, but it is still pretty chillers if you have your summer wear on underneath. I felt my bum numbing after just a minute sat on the freezing stone slabs, but I can pretty skinny, fatties may be ok. They also provide you with socks and shoes too.You have a guide that will tell you a little about the penguins first of all, then you will be handed over to the Penguin trainer (why is that not my job?) who will introduce a few of the penguins to you. They have Gentoo penguins and King penguins there. The Gentoo penguins are really playful and fun and hop around very comically. The king penguins are very proud looking chaps, who true to their name have a very regal aura. They are the second largest in the Penguin family behind the Emperor Penguins and are even more clumsy on their feet, providing us with some great comedy moments as well. As it was malting season though, they were a little bit standoffish, but still very friendly and lovable critters.I am a big animal lover and was wary that the penguins would not be happy in their enclosure or may not be kept very well, this was not the case. The trainers were very professional and obviously well trained themselves. The penguins were very calm and seemed very happy in their environment. They responded very well to the trainers and were not afraid of us visitors at all. I'm not very happy with animals being in captivity but I can see the benefits in some situations, however, they seemed very well looked after.So, you can throw toys for them which they loved to play with and then if you are lucky enough (depending on the size of the group, and if the penguins are not malting) you will then be able to stroke them and pose for some amazing photo's.There were only 3 in our group, so we had a very personal experience, but I think you can pay a bit more for that as well. Probably worth it!If you like a Penguin, you have to do this.Enjoy :)"

Skiing from almost 5 floors high has a beautiful feeling. Due to immense cold a person can withstand this cold for Max 2 or 3 hours and that too without food.

There are lots of upgrade options available to experience other activities.My top tip would be to take your own gloves as the ones supplied are thin and also a hat as it gets very cold and one is not supplied.

For the more experienced skier I recommend the 2 hour visit as going down the 300 to 400 meter long run gets a little old after a while. If you are a good skier there is a Poma lift that gives you a very quick assent. Basically it took 3 minutes for me to go down the run and go back up the Poma lift. Also I recommend either bringing or buying some gloves. I thought the temperature would allow me to getaway without gloves but after 3 runs I went and bought some light gloves they sell at the pro shop. I would recommend this as a activity you can tell people about. The staff was very helpful. The rental ski gear was in OK shape but the boots felt like I was maybe the 500th person to have worn them (i.e. basically no padding left). All that said it is not like you need top of the line gear for this very simple ski hill."

I came from Spain to stay for the Xmas holidays and we decided to visit our beloved Penguins and enjoy snowboarding for an hours.Diego, is Argentinian and his job there is take care of the penguins, but he also gave us a mesmerizing route where the Penguins are living. There, just under the de Snow Zone. Diego showed us the first Emperor penguin family in captivity that going to have babies and so many beautiful things more.When we arrived to the Snow Zone, we met Tarik, special mention to this great guy. He is from Morocco and works here since more than 3 years. He is always taking care of the athletes who are enjoying this amazing place. We even took some pictures with him and my family.We also met a Spanish guy working there! (we are a Spanish family as you can imagine) He is Javier and we received an excellent deal when we arrived to Ski Dubai and ask him for directions to rent our snow clothes and get a ticket.So, in my opinion, Ski duabi is one of the best places to visit in Dubai and, if you think the place is huge and wonderful, let me tell you that the best part is the warm and wonderful people working there.I will no hesitate to come back soon."

The snow is hard and icy, plus the gear ( the suits) is flimsy and will not keep you warm. I've been skiing and snowboarding many times, in many cities, however my 7 yr old nephew had never been. So I decided that ski Dubai would be his first experience, and as such he had a great time.I made certain to dress him warmly ( layers), because I noticed many of the children running in and out because they were freezing. As stated in many other reveiws bring hat, gloves, plus a sweat suit to go under the provided gear. This way you get your full 2 hours worth.I also paid for my nephew you to get kids group ski lesson, which he not only enjoyed, but he learned from.In addition to the ski slope there are also 2 or 3 snow rides. That, I enjoyed!! I will say this, I believe my nephews favorite part, was me dragging him around on a sled like a complete maniac. LolLOVE, LAUGH, AND LIFT OFF"

I have been twice within 2 weeks and both times I have found the process of getting you kit extremely frustrating.on Friday evening there were 2 ski technicians on despite this being one of the busiest nights. there were people arguing as they had ski lessons booked and unable to collect their skis I went the following Monday and there was one ski technician however on this occasion I did manage to visit the Avalanche cafe in the middle of the slope and there were 4 people serving coffee to 2 people ! cmon ski Dubai,,,, sort it out please.the 2nd visit 1/3rd of the slope was not in use as they were building a ski jump to be used for a competition, this was not advertised until you had paid to get in and were collecting your equipment. as a result the drag lift was not in use and therefore you had to use the 4 man chairlift, this takes 5 minutes and about 15 seconds to reach the top, it then took me an average of 40 seconds to ski down again,,,,, got very cold , hence the visit to the cafe.I enjoy the skiing but not the process to acquire your equipment.nice to visit but be prepared to wait !!!"

At 200AED for 2 hours, which includes everything for skiing or snowboarding, except hat and gloves, I thought it was really reasonable. 300AED would have got me a day pass.

I understand that the walls have 5m of insulation to keep the slopes frozen in the desert heat of Dubai. You get all the clothing (ski pants, jacket, socks, skies, poles, ski boots and a locker included in the price. You will need your own gloves and hat to keep comfortable. I used some old socks on my hands which worked OK. Gloves can be purchased in the shop if required. You pay a small deposit for the lift pass which is timed so when your 2 hours is up you can't use the lifts anymore. On Thursday evening when I visited it was almost empty of other skiers. The slope is probably the only \"Black\" (difficult) run indoors and was quite challenging on the one corner if you cut close to the steepest part. Much better than any of the other indoor slopes I have visited. There are two beginners slopes and lesions can be purchased for those new to skiing. They have a small cafe half way down to get a burger and a coffee etc. To get you to the top there is a drag lift and a chair lift on the main slope, the drag being quicker and really quite advanced with two very strong pulling steep bends. The snow was very good quality with no ice or lumps but realistic bumps. It was crazy to ski in the desert but that's Dubai for you. I loved the 2 hours I had and that was just about enough."

I felt like I was transported to my last ski vacation to Austria!We had a pregnant friend with us, and we were concerned she would get bored, but she didn't. They let her take the ski lift half way up and chill at the cabin that had snacks and hot cocoa.This was hands down the best thing we did in Dubai. I think the next time I'm in Dubai I'll make a day of it instead of buying the two hour pass."

We loved the tabogan rides, the Zorbing and the snow slides where you get pushed down and spun whilst sitting on a blow up tube, that was very exhilarating!! The ski chair was brilliant too, you can see all the runs that could rival any European resort! The staff were great even though we witnessed some people being so rude to them (demanding expats with their spoilt children!) There really is no need to ever be rude to someone who is trying to help you and do their job!!! Thanks ski dubai for such a fun time and looking after us all with big smiles on your faces!!!

            "review": "Fun Experience. I am writing this as someone who has done 90% of my skiing in Australia. Someone who has mostly skiied in Europe or North America may have a different perspective.1. There is no scenery because it is indoors. The scenery is one of the bonuses of regular ski resorts. Since Ski Dubai is basically a single big room in a shopping mall, you don't get this.2. There is no sun. This is both good and bad. Skiing outdoors on a sunny day is good for visibility, and enjoying the scenery as mentioned above, but the snow can turn to slush late in the day. That does not happen in this temperature controlled environment.3. There is no wind. So even though it is about -4 degrees in Ski Dubai, there is no wind chill. It also means that the chair lift will not be stopped for safety reasons due to high winds.4. There are not many runs. It looked like 5 runs to me. One is a beginners run for skiing lessons. I did not ski that. There are areas with jumps and rails. I don't know if these are counted as runs. These were too hard for me. That left me with the other two runs which were also the longest. I found that I still enjoyed myself even though I skiied the same two runs all day. Apparently one of these is a blue run, but it would only be a green run in Perisher or Thredbo in Australia where I usually ski. If you are an advanced skiier who is after challenging runs, then Ski Dubai is not for you.5. There is artificial lighting. This means that at 5pm when most ski resorts are shutting down because the sun is setting, Ski Dubai is still busy. In fact I finished skiing at 5pm, having started just before noon, and there still lots of people arriving.6. It is in a big shopping mall. This means that when you stop for a meal, you can just put your ski things in the locker, and go out into the mall to get something to eat. This is much cheaper than a normal ski resort. 7. The jacket and pants and ski hire are included in the price of the day pass, which actually makes it decent value. You have to purchase gloves and hat which is normal everywhere."

If you have the time, you can have the view of inside from the mall which is separated with glass. Entry to the Ski World is very well organised rows and people are ready to help you at every step. You can buy tickets from the internet or book the same across the counter. There are 2 types of tickets, one is general ticket which allows you to most parts of Ski World except for skiing or snow boarding. The general ticket entitles you to a jacket and gum boots. hand gloves are not included nor is a woolen cap to cover your head and ears. Kindly ensure to take them along with you when you visit as it will get pretty chilly inside or you can buy the same at site as there are various shops that sell these items, but would be slight expensive. For the special ticket, I have not asked much, so will not be able to comment accurately on the same, but you will be able to do skiing and snow boarding. Helmets at the entrance are reserved for children only. Once you enter you cannot come out. piece of advice, kindly go to the washroom before you enter the Ski world. Once inside, there is a cave and in the centre of it is a ice sculpture of a dragon. Also there is sitting arrangement on the edge, where you can sit and click images. When you enter the main area, it simply awe's you with the layout, size and the expanse of it. Depending on your visiting time, you will find rush. Try to take week days where there may be comparatively less rush so you can enjoy more number of rides with less amount of time lost for waiting for the same. If you are feeling very cold and need to de freeze, you can come out and before you exit there is an Anti Freeze chamber on the right. You can add DHS 10 for the machine to start and within some time you will feel the difference or you can use the Anti Freeze chamber on exit also.On exiting you have to deposit the gumboots and the jackets and then leave the area. There are curio shops that sell various articles."

On the website the zorb ride and luge ride look really long and exciting, but they are not, very short and not really that exciting, but the children enjoyed it. We got there when it opened so there were no queues and the entrance where you get all dressed up was pretty quiet, but after 45mins inside we were freezing as the clothes are not that insulated and we left, and the hundreds and hundreds of people that were waiting to get in was HUGE, we were glad we left as it would have been so congested in there with massive queues for a short 5 second ride. We didnt ski, we just went in to play with the children. Would not go again and personally would not recommend the expense in terms of value for money. Way overpriced, but having said that, pretty amazing to have a ski slope in the middle of the desert."

Bought a ticket for our family to have a lesson but warned to arrive an hour early as we did. Nobody really helps to tell you the full procedure so allow at least 1.5 hours. 1. Buy the warmer gloves. 2. Is up to -4C inside so bring some warmer clothes if you can - there are changing rooms inside so your clothes won't get creased by the suit provided. 3. Allow time for each individual procedure a. Getting gloves in the shopb. Suit and boots (boots depend on your activity)c. Height, weight, experience to get the right skis etcTHIS ALL TAKES TIME4. Queue on the far side for your lesson. Because of all these ridiculous unguided stages, we missed our lesson by 5 minutes and were asked to wait on one side for the next hour. At this time we were told that as the children were 5 and 11, they will be in separate classes and guess what, due to a shift change we were forgotten about again!!Luckily there was 1 instructor not doing anything and we were given a private family lesson as the next group was in 2 hours so I must say, when you are seen to, they do show they care...The family ticket all in is definitely worth it!! You can enjoy a lesson or time on the slopes then sample all there is to offer inside. Definitely worth spending a few hours on."

We ride mostly in Colorado, but I've ridden small mountains in NC, went to Liberty University's \"Snowflex,\" and I even rode a small mountain in Missouri once! It's all fun to me, just not for a long time. It's easy to ride all day in Breckenridge, for example, but these smaller places are only fun for a couple of hours, really. I like to hit the easier rails and boxes and will do small to medium sizes jumps. There was a nice little box set up when I was there (like most parks, they change the set up frequently), but there were no jumps, except for small ledges on the run, that you could get some air on with enough speed. It's real snow at Ski Dubai, so that's great! We rented boards (decided that smaller than our usual was best for speed). I normally ride a 150cm, but went to a 145 there (I'd never go that small in CO). I wish I would have had my board, but it seemed silly to drag it all that way for a few laps. Next time, I'll bring it though. I ended up going three times. Once I bought the all day pass (pretty cheap and you can leave and come back and ride until closing, even though the website says you can't) so I went twice that day (hit the park, instead of the gym). It's really fun and totally worth it. Everyone I saw there was super stoked, and the runs were empty. I guess they make their money off of the penguin encounter and the snow village, because there weren't many people on the slopes. I loved Ski Dubai...and hope to go back some day. If you're a skier or snowboarder and you don't check out Ski Dubai...you're missing out. It's so neat! So go ahead...go shred!"

We had a penguin encounter booked and entry to the snow park. My 9 year old son then added a ski lesson on which he thought was fantastic. The only reason I gave this place 4 stars instead of 5 stars is because of the prices of photos afterwards. It was the last day of our holiday and I didn't bring a lot of money to the mall with me as I thought we had everything paid, except for money for food. We had booked our tickets on EmiratesYoo and the ticket we bought said each of us would get a lesson included which was not true, we were told that it cost extra to add this on so I paid extra for my son only. Then when we met the penguins we were told that we couldn't use our own cameras but not to worry as a photographer would take some for us. I feel the photographer should have asked first if we wanted a professional photo or if he wanted to use our camera as they do in a lot of other tourist attractions! I didn't think it was fair to charge so much money for the photos afterwards especially when you weren't allowed to get anyone to take a photo for you, or 1 should at least be included in the price. We ended up not buying any photos.The snow park is great and has lots of different slides etc. We had a very good day here and we will defiantly be back but we will skip the penguins I'd say I wasn't too impressed the the whole encounter and wouldn't recommend it, I do however, really recommend the snow park and the ski lesson and make sure to bring lots of money!"

We approached the ticket desk and talked with Peter and another guy who were very unhelpful. What they don't tell you is that you need at least 4 ski lessons to be allowed on the slopes. It's a complete waste of time, because who has time to take FOUR 60 minute lessons when you're visiting Dubai? Especially when you have to pay for each session! Over the course of 60 minutes you should be able to learn how to start, stop, turn, and get on the ski lift, but Ski Dubai wants to take all of your money by breaking the sessions up, which makes no sense. They say you need minimum experience which we have, but they really want you to have olympic ski experience. Instead of being understanding, Peter tried to sell us on the \"snow experience\" which is really for kids and not adults. Ski Dubai was the most disappointed part of our Dubai experience and a complete waste of our time."

I come from a place where I can snowboard during the winter, and I have to admit that this was still very fun. I attended with my girlfriend and we both enjoy snowboarding. The price is fair and was round about 500 AED (~$150) for both of us which included all the equipment, ski clothes, and 2 hour lift pass. It was very awesome to hit the slopes on the indoor mountain in the cool -4 degree C (25F) while is was over 45 degrees C outside (113F). We really enjoyed it as well as the hot chocolate at the mountain top lodge. The staff were all very helpful and friendly and they even have a ski patrol... haha. Quite funny to see in the desert. There are multiple packages including family packs, student deals, and training packages for first timers to learn. I am experienced, so we just opted for the ordinary package with just a lift ticket. If you have kiddoes you can opt for the kids package and play in the snow and enjoy the penguin show. It was definitely a must see/do in Dubai and I would happily repeat the adventure if I am in Dubai again. They also have lockers available for rental to place your goods while you are skiing/snowboarding."

Staff were good and plentiful, recommended we only needed one locker. The price was about what we expected for a couple of hours. So far so good. Then the queues start. First to get your boots and clothes. It there were 2 staff getting the boots which was a 15-20 wait and we asked for jacket and leggings. Another 10 minute wait as the same staff do that. Then we asked for socks and they were instant. You then get dressed and put your stuff in the lockers. There were only a few available and some had damaged doors. Then to the check in machines to register your contact details plus weight, height and experience. Only a short wait here. Then queue for skis. Only one person fitting those to your boots. Where is you print out he asks, what print out. From the check in machine. Most people in the queue look puzzled like we do. Of the 4 or 5 machines only 2 have paper in them so yep it's another queue for those. Back in the ski queue with paper. Another 15 minute wait. It's now just before 9 pm an hour gone by and no skiing yet. Oh you've got no gloves sir you can buy them there for AED 25. Finally skiing at 9:05 and its was good. But streamline the entry or I won't be going back"

We had two instructors Uzi and Mark who really helped my kids get comfortable during our 5 day training program.Good equipment from gloves to skis to shoes to gloves to overalls to salopettes to helmets...all available for a fee to hire as well as to buy. Having traveled and seen prices I wouldn't buy as the stuff is way overpriced; this would be my only negative of Ski Dubai that they should reconsider their astronomical pricing in everything...although there is a case to keep it such to help keep the crowds to manageable levels.

Here there is indeed a learning slope, but you will never have the parent/child learning experience you want because 1: you have to sign up the kids for classes and 2: you can't teach them yourself, but a stranger must do it for you. A ridiculous approach coming from what is supposed to be a family destination.

Didn't have high expectations for this laugh of a place and ended up having a ball.Note that you normally buy 2 or 3 hours and the system tracks you by a small card that is scanned at the base of the chair lift or J-Bar (Card sits in your sleeve so no fiddling about).The gear that is supplied is only just warm enough but it does the job for 2 hours, not so sure about the 3 hour selection :-)Note, they won't supply gloves so bring your own or be prepared to buy some.I went in the middle of the week in August and the numbers were about right for a good mix of socialising and skiing without having to avoid others."

The giant zorbs and the bob sleigh have a minimum height restriction of 1 metre. Both are very good fun!! Especially the giant zorbs! The penguin shows are a must! But they run every few hours so make sure you ask when the next one upon arrival.Good fun day out temperature inside is roughly -3 degrees compared to the 45 degrees outside!!"

You are supplied with ski jacket, trousers and helmet, gloves and socks, boots and obviously skis. There was hardly anyone there when we went so the wait time for the chair lift was negligible so we spent most of the time skiing. They have some great runs which by indoor standards were fabulous. As an experienced skier it didn't challenge me but I was there for my kids and they had a fabulous time. The operation was very efficiently run and they had lots of special touches to make you feel like you were in the Alps. Definitely worth a visit unless you come from a country where you ski every weekend!"

This experience is perfect for the whole family because there is so much to do even if you don't want to ski or snowboard (like penguins and super awesome ice activities!!!). There are 2 ski runs, a chairlift, a T-bar (what do they call those lifts that you put between your legs...a puma?) and a beginner slope with a couple of magic carpets. You can literally hire all of your ski gear and just wear any regular clothes underneath. It's really cool looking out through the glass at the side and into the shopping centre. There's a cafe halfway up the slope and it's just such a cool experience. The slopes are also really well maintained! DO THIS! DO NOT HESITATE BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN SKIING IN OTHER PLACES!

Very well organised in paying, collecting jacket and sallopetes, then acquiring skis and boots. You actually weigh and measurer your height and print off a slip where your skis are given according to experience and Body mass index (which they should be, but many don't bother).You get a locker put onto your lift pass which you receive 20 Durhams back at the end for returning it to electronic system- again easily done.We got there at 09.30 am before it was busy- as it does get packed later in the day. 2Hours cost us 200 Durhams each, and it was worth it.Seasoned skiers like ourselves got bored after half an hour but we managed to last it out an hour. Only a couple of runs, and not a black as advertised, just a simple red really, but lack of crowds early when we got on, made it able to ski fast and it was enjoyable.You get free socks but now have to pay for gloves at the shop if you want them- we didn't bother- but it was cold on the hands after a while!Actually the jacket an pants were very well fitted, and loose, though had no pockets in them- so if you wanted a drink whilst on the slope, it meant you had to return to collect money- unless you keep some money elsewhere on your person.Overall a very good experience and well organised."

It was our 2nd day in Dubai on 26-07-2015, we went to the Mall of Emirates to enjoy SKI Dubai, we spend more than 6 hours but I think even after 6 hours we don\u2019t want to come back from SKI Dubai.We enjoyed the followings;Fantastic SnowIce cave with ice sculptures - a dragon and some swans. Penguins ShowRolling ball Chair lift, drag lift. Ski shop.Even many more I cannot express my feelings in words.We meet 2 types of penguins and even touch them. You can touch them & hug them. They are well trained and smart. Pictures or videos aren't allowed. They have their own photographer and you have to pay to get your pictures and it's a little expensive.I would recommend every too must visit SKI Dubai with family , friends and relatives. It really a wonderful place. Syed Shahrukh Riaz"

As we do ski, we didn't need trainers, but such are available. 2 hours were enough as we were not well prepared for the minus 2-3 degrees Celsius inside. Although they give you ski jacket, trousers and socks, it was cold for the children wearing just short pants and thin jackets. If you want you can buy gloves additionally. Although very crowded fortunately most of the visitors were not skiing, but using other attractions and there were no queues for the ski lifts. The slope is relatively short but you can make a lot of runs."

There is a good area for the kids with a Range of activities but I find that ski Dubai is more for expert skiers. There is only a small hill for people like my friend and I to ski down and that's it. You can go on the chairlift but if you get off at the top the hill you have to come down is extremely tall and long and is for expert skiers only. You don't have to get off at the top, you can just make your way back down. I probably wouldn't go back but if your an avid skier I think it would be great"

Cons:-Admission = 150 AED for 'Snow Bullet' zip-wire (2 runs), but this included the ski jacket & trousers.-Locker = 25 AED. -Queue for tickets, long queue for ski jacket & trousers, queue for locker ticket, queue for chairlift, queue for Snow Bullet zip-wire.-Staff issuing ski jacket & trousers looked miserable. -Mobbed with children as Saudi Arabia school holidays. Notes: -Take gloves, hat and a jumper/fleece jacket. -Ski hire and ski lessons are available. Plus a zorbing, tubing and a toboggan run. -There is also a penguin show featuring live penguins. You can watch it for free from the Costa Coffee."

Instead we queued for an hour to get a zorb which lasted all of 3 seconds. The ski lift queue was slightly less but still a decent wait, and this was just about all there was to do. For the entrance fee, none of us thought it was worth it and we won't be visiting again.My tip is to wrap up very warm as you'll do lots of standing around in the cold.Very disappointing experience"

When you enter, you first select and purchase the package you want. Then you get your gloves (fleece ones are free and waterproof ones cost extra). Then you get in another line for your boots, ski pants and ski jacket. Think confusing and exhausting. While waiting in line for our boots, pants and jacket the family of 8 in front of us didn't know their correct sizes and the poor attendant had to go back and forth to get them their correct sizes which turned out to be extra large and extra extra large. Just admit you are never going to get that in a medium size pants and jacket and move on! We rode the chair lift first since the line was short. Then we waited in other lines and they seemed to last forever especially for the Zorb. All the while our feet are getting frostbitten. We were told throwing snow balls is not allowed. How lame is that. It appeared that all of the workers inside didn't like the cold weather because they were all cranky and never smiled or appeared the least bit happy. To tell you the truth I couldn't blame them. After spending about 2.5 hours inside my wife and 9 year old son determined it was time to go and I wholeheartedly agreed. We purchased the photo that was taken of us on the chair lift which was very good. A couple of days later we were walking by Ski Dubai and saw how empty it was because it had just opened. I realized that should have been the time that we went in and the place would have been way more enjoyable. We can check this off of our bucket list and probably will never go again."

After the encounter we could go to the snow park for the kids to play in the snow and get on the rides. If you have young children though, please make sure they wear a helmet in the snow park as in some of the areas the snow was as solid as rock and some kids around were throwing them at each other and anyone passing by which could do some serious damage without the helmet."

Their jackets do not have any pockets except for the one on the upper left arm which is used for the pass, so don't plan on carrying a lot of \"stuff\" with you while skiing. We ski at home so the slope was not a challenge at all, but still a fun way to spend a couple of hours. Our only disappointment was that there were no \"Ski Dubai\" T-shirts for sale, but oh well.If you pay with a MasterCard they give you a discount of either 10% or 20% (sorry, don't recall), but if you pay with a Visa, there is no discount. Plan a little extra time to get geared up - especially if it is busy. They pay special attention to getting the ski bindings adjusted properly for your weight and skiing ability, so it is worth the wait."

I think due to the concept of going out on snow slopes in the dessert really appealed to us. We decided to go for the Power Pass after looking at the various options and we are so glad we did. This included access to the snowpark area and we had a discovery lesson. The snow park had some great rides from toboggan, tubing and going in a giant snowball. The discovery lesson was fantastic! I've been skiing in Europe before so decided to try out snowboarding with my wife as she has never been. The instructor was excellent, from starting off with the basics to moving onto more advanced things, within 1 hour the group of four of us felt like we'd made amazing progress. The Powerpass we purchased was about \u00a350 but this included access to the snowpark rides and the lesson. As well suits, snow boots, skiing/snowboarding equipment and fleeced gloves were included. Please note: snow suits are very thing and you will need a layer or to underneath. We brought ski gloves with us and purchased hats.Definitely a great place to go if you want to learn if you've never been before. Experienced skiers/boarders could find the slopes a bit tedious after a few goes! Great activity to do in Dubai and I thought it was reasonably priced as well."

You can spend at least 4 hours without getting bored . The only drawback is the long lines to some of the popular rides . Tips : 1. Try to choose a day or a time that is not so popular and do the popular rides ( sliding on a sledge and the snow ball ) first before the lines are two long . 2. If you have the entertainer , saves you loads . Also MasterCard had a 20% off the super pass ticket . 3. If you don't do the penguin encounter , do have a peak near the entrance , you can see them and see them swimming , and they do run some 15 minutes marches show at several times that is free and you see them quite close , you just don't touch them . 4. Do plan to stop for a rest in the middle in the Avalanche cafe on your way up in the lift chair . The only place you can really rest and warm up and the food is good and really cheap (20 dirhams a sandwich) Try the nachos and the chicken wrap sandwich . 5. Do get a pouch bag or something that you can put your money and camera , as the suits have no pocket and it is quite a hassle getting things out and back in . 6. Photos are 150 dirhams each super expensive , take your camera and take pics yourself , so as not to feel obliged to buy the photos unless they are absolutely fabulous . You won't get camera in when doing the penguin encounter though , so I guess for this you do need buy the photos . Have fun , our kids 7 and 4 loved it , and they just love playing with the snow . If you have gloves , bang with you , they provide you with fleece that are not water proof but also they don't have good size for little ones . Do get something to cover your head or ears to prevent you from freezing . Kids get hoodies and they wear helmets so they are fine . Have fun ."

We had fun but had done everything we wanted to do within a couple of hours. I was disappointed that the price on entry is separate depending on if you wanted to ski, we didn't know this and once we tried to ski were told that we were in the wrong clothing & shoes so would need to go out & purchase other clothes/equipment so we didn't bother. The Zip-Line was heaps of fun! Seemed to be a lot of activities for kids and people who wanted to learn to ski. Tips: BYO snow gloves if you have them, as the free ones are cotton so you end up paying for proper ones. Also a beanie would be handy as it's fairly cold in there! Get your own photos as the ones they take are an absolute rip off! ($30AU each)"

You only appreciate the size when you take the ski slide which takes you all the way to the top and then back down. Its can be very busy so you need to really go and visit during non school term. We visited towards end of july so it was very busy. This was annoying! However, it's perfect for experienced skiers. The kids play area in my opinion needs to be bigger, the slides need to be longer. The play area for younger children is perfect. The entry price is too expensive unless you have the buy one get one free vounchers. Overall a good experience but very busy. Also its really good that they provide the winter clothing & boots!"

My kids love penguins so it was well worth it. We didn't actually ski or snowboard but did some sledging, other snow activities and a trip up the ski-lift. Eventually we decided it was time to get back into the heat! Recommend going early to beat the crowds, Friday is good in the mornings, gets very busy in the afternoons and on Saturdays. Avoid local holidays as it's jammed then."

The snow was good, the crowd was very small, the price was reasonable, and we spent two solid hours on the slopes. Granted, the runs were pretty short, but all in all it was an exciting and memorable adventure. They give you everything you need except gloves, and I didn't miss the gloves at all.

When at last we found somebody from Ski Dubai, they were not very helpful and rude. After all the running around, getting ski clothes and gear, we were too late for our class! What they do not tell you is that if you are a first time skier, to ski down the slopes, you need to take AT LEAST 4 lessons! It is not worth it, because we could not take four lessons, we were only in Dubai for a few days. Its a waste of time, they are not organized, they do not tell you what and where to go. In the end we ask our money back - they first refused but in the end we got our money back. I think if you can ski, it will be sort of ok, although its not that impressive! "

Stay away from peak times as it can be busy and down right dangerous as safety is not all it could be, along with simple good manners for down slope. Just take a moment to remember where you are when skiing, the middle of the desert and its -4C"

Conveniently located at Mall of the Emirates, Ski Dubai is a one of a kind experience for everyone who's looking for a mood that is slightly different from Dubai's typical hot weather.Since I do not know how to ski or snowboard, I just bought the ticket for the regular access of all the games in the main area. I also took the telefrik ride all the way up and back down. There are restaurants inside, the prices are relatively reasonable. Even though they provide you with the full suit including shoes, you'll still need to layer up a bit as it's quite cold inside. Recommended for a fun day with your little ones, just don't go during public holidays as it gets insanely crowded and you'd hardly have fun waiting for such long queues at every game/ride."

It is a strange feeling to be on a slope with a snowboard under your feet while outside there are 50 degrees C. The slope is short and might be a bit boring for experts, but it is challenging enough for beginners and regular users. Very funny with friends. Just note that inside there are -4 degrees and without sunlight it is going to be very cold. The facility provides you with a ski jacket and trousers but are very light, hence bring your own hat, gloves and wear a pullover if you are sensible to cold climate. Tip: sky for the time you have paid. After it you might go and enjoy a hot chocolate at the Alpine cafe built at the middle of the slope."

Only in Dubai..There's lot of mucking about in getting started - buying the ticket, getting the clothes & boots then getting your snowboard and finally getting out on the slope. It could be made a little more efficient: fortunately we went in the middle of the day in Ramadan when it wasn't too busy but it still took close to an hour to finally get organised. I hate to think what it's like when busy.You then get out on the slope. The snow quality is reasonable (for artificial, indoor snow). It certainly is not to dis-similar to the made made stuff on Australian ski resorts. As expected, the run is very short (all over in less than 1 minute) which makes the 10 minute lift ride to the top unbearably slow and frustrating. There are, however, a few decent rails but with a very hard landing - they could pad the landing site with a little bit more snow. The upper set of rails also ends at the top of a beginner carpet which means you have to be careful otherwise you could land on a bunch of beginners (most of whom don't really know about jumps and looking up the mountain etc.)Overall, something interesting in the desert. Good intermediate and experts will be bored pretty quickly. They really need to speed the lift up to make it more than a 12 minute cycle (with 1 minute of downhill)"

            "review": "Great family fun in the Snow Park. We had a fabulous morning (4 hours) at ski Dubai located in mall of Emirates. We were lucky to get a Ramadan special for 200 AED per person which included gloves (which can be upgraded to ski gloves) a locker, unlimited rides on the toboggan, sledges, zorb balls and tubes plus a return chair lift ride and a snow bullet (zip line) ride (children must be over 30kg). It was a Thursday and really quiet. Still expensive (as everything is in Dubai) but a fun way for our children to experience snow for the first time. With a burning 44 degrees outside I had some concerns about -4 degrees inside, but we only felt cold following our ride on the Snow Bullet, after which we went back into the changing area for a quick warm up before returning inside for more fun. Clothes provided seemed thin initially, but were actually very functional. Note - you place your pass in a zipped pocked on your left sleeve and this gets scanned for some rides. There are no other pockets in the clothing, so wear clothes with pockets underneath if you wish to take your camera with you. Take a hat and scarf along, but no need to dress really warm. Staff inside were very friendly and happy to make rides on the tubes and zorbs as tame or as exciting as you wanted. Snow bullet was fun - not scary, but relaxing, thrilling and very cold on the face!We didn't ski but it would be a great place to learn if you are an apprehensive first timer."

But then again I come from Canada and have been skiing on pretty amazing Hills. You can totally pick up some speed from top to bottom though! Overall it was a great experience. I bought the unlimited day ski pass because it wasn't much more then the two hour pass. Although the two hour pass would have probably been sufficient because it gets somewhat repetitive quickly. If you can bring your own gloves and touqe. Those are the only two things not included in the ticket. It cost 25usd for a basic pair of insulated gloves. Fleece ones are cheaper."

Several activities for the family all based in a small area at the bottom of the hill, which can be crowded at times. Most visitors will spend their time in the area at the hill base, which is not always very fresh with new snow so look a bit dirty.The best place for me and my son was the time spent at mid-hill at the coffee shop having a whipped cream top hot chocolate outside on the deck over-looking the skiers. The worst was soon after arriving and going to get the supplied Winter jackets and ski pants. You may have experienced this in your past putting these items on that are not very fresh and still very damp from the last user, very icky.It not that expensive to enter unless your planning on buying anything from the gift shop which is normal Worldwide. To get some relief from the outside heat of Dubai, Ski Dubai is not all that wrong and good for a couple of hours, maybe a bit more if you wish. Ski Dubai is a touristy concept, but still a \"COOL\" idea for the littles ones and families all together.Chill out @ Ski Dubai,"

It was a great feeling to experience it specially here in the middle east during the summer time. The ticket prices are posted on their web, you can check it out if there is a promotion or any other packages. They also offer lesson and training on Skiing. There is quad lift and a tow lift for skiers and snowboarders to help them up to the mountain. There is Snow Park play area with sled and toboggan runs, an icy body slide, climbing towers, giant snowballs and an ice cave which my daughter enjoys a lot. Today also available are Penguin encounter where you can get encounter with penguins. I recommend you all to visit and try Ski Dubai to complete your journey and experience one of the best and the first Indoor Ski Snow themed park."

Dubai blows me away anyway for its sheer opulence, but this ski slope theme park inside a glass dome in a shopping mall did my head in! I have read reviews from people who have actually gone inside, and they all seem to say it is very good value and service and obviously a lot of fun, especially for kids! All I can say is, that it is just as much fun perhaps to just watch people and families in the mall (who are wearing shorts and t-shirts) go inside, put on lots of Arctic clothing and obviously freeze themselves as they go on the ski lift, tumble down the slope and so forth, and then come back outside laughing, in their desert wear again! This way you can have some free vicarious fun while having a coffee and not freeze!!"

I took the beginners lesson with a good instructor and only about 6 people in the class. Everything you need is included in the price. They offer lots of expensive extras, like gloves and goggles, etc, but you don't really need anything more than is included.

The infrastructure its massive and you can clearly see it when you arrive to Mall of the Emirates (where its located). The attraction itself has lots to offer from the simply skiing or snowboarding in the big slope or taking some of the rides creates around the snow (mostly design for the kids). The entrance fee its around 70 USD plus some add ons for locker, boots and lessons. In my opinion, its a great place to learn how to ski in a very easy environment. You would learn a couple of moves and feel comfortable enough to try the slope. There are learning packages of several classes at a great value and the instructors are very nice.If you are coming from a skiing country, its kind of a pointless place as a tourist but if you are afraid of it, its a nice place to start. The place its extremely cold and the jacket that its provides its not enough, so take a hat and some gloves (a softshell underneath would be great as well)."

They have great abilities for people trying skiing or snowboarding for the first time and the main slopes, while limited as you'd expect, are still fun for experienced skiers if just for pure novelty. There are even some smaller terrain park features to mix things up.Our only disappointments involved customer service. The ticket seller did not seem very knowledgeable about their products and needed her supervisor's assistance to sell us basic 2-hour ski passes. The poma lift (for experienced skiers, faster than the slow chairlift also used for \"sightseeing\") was closed for maintenance without prior notice or a discount on the pass price. The rental process was not clearly marked and everything we were initially given (jackets, pants, and boots) was too big and had to be exchanged. Finally, the changing area was filthy.Overall, we'd recommend visiting Ski Dubai, especially if you're a skier or snowboarder looking for a unique experience! Just be prepared for the process of getting geared up to take a while and for the staff to not be as helpful as they should be for such an attraction."

There are different packages which you can buy either by directly visiting the place or booking online. We went for the AED 275 per person package which included Giant ball, Cable car, Penguin meet and Ice Park/slides. The facilities are quite good inside. The package includes gloves + warm clothing + boots. However the gloves + jackets provided were not very thick and we felt quite chilly inside. I would recommend wearing some warm clothes before visiting the place. You can try the giant ball/cable car/slides multiple times within the AED 275 package. There is also a cafe (Avalanche) inside the attraction and can be reached using the cable car. The items in the cafe were quite reasonably prices (cheaper than Starbucks) and hot chocolate in a must try in the freezing cold. Best part of the attraction was meeting and feeding the penguins. However make sure you book in advance as the slots get exhausted for meeting the penguins. There will be a 20 minutes demo where the instructor will explain the do's and don'ts and then you can meet/feed/pose with the penguins. However you cant take pictures with the penguins with your own cameras. Their are photographers who will take pics and then sell 1 hard copy to you for AED 115 which is very high. I would suggest to try this place as its an experience to be in ice within a desert.Recommendations to the facility management:1. Increase the number of attractions inside the snow park2. Reduce the price of selling photographs shot with the penguin"

There are a few sledges around which she loved just being pulled around in the snow. We had one chair lift ride with our pass so we went up the slope (pretty huge) to the cafe for a hot chocolate. Our daughter loved the chair lift and hot chocolate. The only downside was that we were freezing. We thought the hired equipment would be nice and warm, the jackets and ski pants are not they are pretty thin and we got cold quickly. We were not allowed to go out and come back in (might have been a language thing with my husband and the guard). My husband left early and we stayed to see the penguin parade. Which turned out to be a great experience. We were picked from the crowd and got to go inside and meet/ touch a penguin and have photos taken. My daughter was so delighted it made our day.

Same for the cap.It has good activities and you will be amazed what they have achieved in Dubai.Skiers have good options, but I did not choose it but went for penguin encounter. Glad I did it. Penguins are so cute and they were well behaved(read it trained!!!!). If you go with kids ensure you take the pass which has penguin encounter. The guides provide all the info about penguin + how we should behave infront of the penguin ;)..Keep in mind that you cannot take any pics of the penguin with your own camera. Each pic which they take of yours cost 100 AED but you have no choice. You have chair lift which you can take umpteen times.

Like most places in Dubai are insane price this was one of the best example as overall hardly any free rides for basic entry and power pass comes with 2 rides and super pass was best if you want to experience everything. But still it overall hardly have much rides and or to do. Unless someone is into skiing. I find bit overpriced comparing with number of rides it offers. Even thought opted for super pass I fished this place within 2 hours. Just to keep in mind better bring you own gloves and caps else u have to buy from there which are useless and expensive."

Don't be put off by the huge amount of people going into this attraction, as 80% are just going in to play in the kiddies area at the bottom and they never venture onto the slope.

It actually gets very cold after a while in there!! Overall we had a lot of fun at ski dubai, we bought the 300aed ticket that was 2 hours skiing and then unlimited time in the snow park, I would advise against the snow park if your above the age of 12 as it really is mostly for kids, it's fun but definitely not worth the extra 100aed."

The chairlift is a bit on the slow side but that's due to people not skiing just going up and down on it taking photos etc. there are two slopes one being a black and it is just like skiing on the slopes somewhere. There is the snow park, zip slide and tobogganing and a few other fun things to do like meeting real penguins. The Avalanche cafe on the slopes does a mean hot chocolate with cream and marshmallows and it is all good fun. Make sure you have gloves as it is quite cold after two hours skiing. Good laugh."

I had never really skied before and they literally took me from stage one, step by step. You have the option to either take group classes or individual classes, the individual obviously being more effective, not to say the group classes are not, but the focus will be solely on you. I took the group classes (easier on the pocket). They do all the fittings and measurements for your boots, be it for snow boarding or skiing, and they also provide you all the equipment and warm clothing as well. You would only need to bring your own gloves, for hygiene purposes, or you could buy them there. Lot's of fun, you won't regret, whether you're a pro skier/snowboarder, starting for the 1st time, or whether you want to bring the family for a fun day out with their activities. A must see in Dubai!!"

I thought it was genius, the fact we were in the desert and yet you can go skiing! I sat right by Costa coffee and had a great view of the slope, the snowman and watching the kids throwing snowballs at the window. There is this huge ski life that takes you to the top of the slope and to watch people skiing while there are people shopping around them - only in Dubai. I have to be honest if I had more time I would have done it. When I return in 2016 I shall be trying this. Would recommend it as it looks like true fun."

We went on a Friday afternoon after completing out shopping.After buying your ticket you proceed to pick up your gear to get onto the slope. It took us over 30min to get our gear, which means we missed our pick up to the slope. Whilst waiting there were children distracting the person helping us every 2 min. They would not follow the line, walk to the front and just touch all the tools being used to set up our ski's.After getting our ski'd we proceeded to the slope unassisted.On arriving we were greeted by a not very un-impressed instructor who asked us why we were late.We were not asked to join the group, and proceeded to wait for another 5min. Eventually we were asked to join the group, and proceeded to have our instruction.I thought the service was poor for a beautifully constructed place. The most disappointing was not being told that we needed to ask if we wanted photos taken. As all out valuables were in the locker we did not have any memory of this even though the facilities exist. And would advise visitors to be at least an hour early for any lesson.The one saving grace was that we had lost a ring, and service to locate it and return it to us was excellent!"

Most guests may not have seen snow before, so for experts it's really a novelty, playground type experience. The ride up the hill (?!) is slow and lines can make it even slower. It's the equivalent of a bunny hill and there are some boxes and jumps for tricks.So don't go for the ride, you will get bored fast if you are a serious or even intermediate rider, but at least you can say that you ski'd or snowboarded in the desert"

Believe me all our kids including me and my wife got our fingers totally frozen. Becaz of this we could not enjoy anything. So make sure you wear very good gloves. If you are a ski rider then its your day. Its really worth. We had very good time in cable car. It was awesome. Other rides inside were much focused on children. All together you can spend maximum 2 hrs. After that you really feel totally frozen. They charge around usd 40 per head without ski ride. It is quite very expensive.

We used to go up within 5 mns, on our last two visits it took us 9-10 mns. Not really fair especially that the faster lift on the left side is out of order/under maintenance since a month.SKI Dubai can you look into this in order not to loose your skiers!

The second is very steep and wide all the way and then a long finisher. For two slopes, having a wide variety is amazing. It is very peaceful and even though it is indoors, the views are amazing, so bring a thin camera / smartphone.Ski Dubai provides you with boots, suit, ski trousers, poles and skis however if you can, bring your own stuff.I recommend arriving at Ski Dubai at 8:00AM as in midday, it is packed and there is no space in the changing rooms.You should come with a friend and I recommend staying for 2-3 hours.The snow park is also very entertaining.

Kids will surely enjoy the slides on ice, ball ride etc. The ropeway across the park is very good. You will be definitely be chilled when you reach at certain heights. All the rides and activities are for adults also. Some people feel it to cold when then enter, but again the good part is you can come out for some time and go in again without bothering about tickets etc. Penguin show is added attraction.

For anyone who can already ski or snowboard, Ski Dubai is a must!For only 200AED you get ski's, boots, a jacket and longs and two hours on the slope.For beginners, there are lessons. For those who already ski/snowboard you can start on the easiest slope which is the first stop on the chair lift. At this platform you get off turn right and have a gentle run down to the base. This is also the point at which you can stop and have a quick coffee, hot chocolate or bite to eat if you feel like getting the true skiing experience.If you stay on the lift instead of getting off at this first point you are taken up to the top, at which there are two routes that you can take, with one of the runs being steeper than the other. This means that you can get your ski legs back for a few runs and then hit the faster slope.This 400m slope (80m wide) is never going to compete with outdoor skiing but is amazing considering the temperature outside the building.I have told my wife that in future I only want to fly Emirates when travelling overseas so that we can include a stop over for a day so that I can take in a quite ski."

Average costing would be 3000 per person. Initially you might wonder why people are shivering, those who have just come out but no sooner you will realise this that inside it is chilling cold. You have so many activities to do here. Some of them are included in your ticket. You can enjoy ride on each. If you are lucky you can enjoy watching Penguins show here. World's second biggest penguin is here and all in all 24 penguins have been restored here for public. A trolly that takes you to up and brings you down will let you experience the whole view of thsi area. though inside the mall but it isnt small.

If I didn't know that we were inside of a mall I would not have known the difference. The atmosphere was as if we were in Lake Tahoe at Heavenly or any other ski resort. The temperature was kept at 30 degrees so it was cold!!. We arrived in summer clothes and was able to change into our thermals and sweats. Snow suits and socks were provided and we brought our own hats and gloves with us as they are available for you to purchase. Lockers were available for a fee to lock up our personal belongings and the skis and poles were included with our rental along with the snow suits and socks. Hours for Ski Dubai are 10am - 11pm and we purchased our ticket online for $55 USD for 2 hours. You are able to choose your own time at anytime during the opening hours. There is another part of the Ski Resort that does not include the Ski price. It is separate to participate in a big ball that you can roll down the hill in and also there is a part where you can ride a zipline. The ski was enough for us! We enjoyed it and had an awesome time!"

However, there are two big concerns:1- No instructions or signs to direct you to the location of each game. We were looking for the entrance of the chairlefts for 15 minutes till we were able to find it after asking employees who don't even smile.2- The worst thing happened was during (meet the penguin) session. I paid extra money expecting good service. First, we were not able to watch the instructional video because the door had technical problems! later the employee who provided the session was horrible (so much serious with the kids). My 6 yr old son was trying to show his simple knowldge about penguins which he learnt in school this year, but unfortunately the employee was so rude not allowing him to say a word! later he shouted on a little girl because she wasn't following his instructions.. I told him the girl doesn't understand English.. he said to me in a very rude way but you saw the video and it was in Arabic! this indicates there is such a bad communication among employees. Moreover, this particular employee doesn't have the basic skills of giving a show or a session in entertaining place.. he does't smile, does't interact with people, and the worst thing he wanted me to keep my purse with his friend (supposedly be security)!! I went to tons of places such as Disney theme parks in Paris, LA, Orlando and many others, but this experience was terrible because of the employees and not the place itself.For further info., you may contact me at alsaleh.d@gust.edu.kwIf Ski dubai want to take the necessary action about the employee, our session was at 2.30pm on Thurs. 9/4/2015.Regards,Dr. Dhoha AlSaleh (Kuwait)"

My son had a lesson and developed his skills.My reservations are on the organisational side. The centre did not respond to email correspondence which meant that our beginner booking was ultimately incorrect. Clothing collection is a muddle and caused significant delays, almost to the point of my son missing his lesson. The clothing was good and comfortable but had insufficient pockets to hold a phone, wallet etc. Therefore I could not buy a drink on the slopes, which was surely the point! Information and co-ordination was generally poor, but the overall experience was very good.On a second visit some of our group did the Exclusive Penguin Experience, which was truly excellent in all respects, helped by having experienced the confusion in obtaining clothing etc.My advice is that this facility is definitely worth a visit, but please have patience through the confusion!"

During our free time in Dubai, my friends and I decided to kill two birds with one stones: ride the metro to see Ski Dubai, an attraction that piqued our curiosity. A 25-story ski resort in a mall in the desert? Really?We purchased a day pass from the Al Rigga station in the Deira section of Dubai to reach The Mall of the Emirates, a 35-minute ride (12 stops) on the Red Line. Exit the station and you are at the mall. Very convenient. Of the malls we visited (Dubai and Yas in Abu Dhabi), we found the Mall of the Emirates to be the most elegant with 535 stores; 97 restaurants and cafes; 2 luxury hotels (5* Sheraton and Kempinski).We relied on a mall locator map to direct us to Ski Dubai (www.skidxb.com) on the G floor near the Virgin megastore and adjacent to the Cheesecake Factory. We were strictly observers; another friend skied here the day before. She is a Minnesota native and while she was happy for the experience, commented that it was fairly simple for one native to the land of the frozen chosen. Ski Dubai It was fun to watch the kids all dressed in helmets, snowpants, gloves and boots throwing artificial snow snowballs at each other. We were able to see the chair lift and bobsled run but could not see the ski slope from our vantage point next door to the Cheesecake Factory.The resort packs 6,000 tons of artificial snow with a tow lift, and quad chairlift to service the five runs. Ski and snowboard lessons are available along with access to a quarter-pipe freestyle zone."

Their skin is unexpectedly soo soft and the excitement i got from petting them and watching them cannot be compared to any other activity i did in Dubai. One could go on this tour with family, friends, or with a loved one. The only thing in my opinion that was unnecessarily over priced was taking the pictures after leaving ski Dubai.

They didn't tell me that after my lesson I wouldn't be able to snowboard by myself and practice what I just learnt. You're not allowed on the slopes - even the low ones. This was the only reason I got this pass. When questioned they then disclosed that they don't do partial refunds. Very disappointed. Rip off."

We enjoyed our experience very much. We opted for the 500 riyal experience which included beginner ski lessons, a penguin experience, access to the ski fun park and also lunch. The instructor was helpful and knowledgeable and the skiing was great fun. The penguin experience was fantastic but perhaps mainly aimed at children and the fun park was good fun but not as good as the skiing or penguins. Overall I would recommend any tourists to visit ski Dubai but maybe consider just the lessons or just the penguins - the complete package is a little overpriced and the photographs are extortionate."

All clothing, skis, and boots are provided. Boots will be well worn, so advise getting a smaller boot than shoe size. Low cost gloves (20Dh) with Ski Dubai logo make for a collectors item, and function to keep the cold down. The room is kept at freezing, so wear a few extra clothes to stay warm. Riding the Poma lift also helps keep you warm. I'm usually ready to quit after 2 hours."

Very good ski tuition (group and private lessons for all)d. uncluttered slopes ideas for a once a year skiere. the black run, is easy but fun.f: you can book a whole day's ski which means you leave the slope or mall and come back again the same day and ski some more, cost is very little extra and excellent value.The Bad bits:a. The Penguins: they shouldn't be there. not good.b. The ski lifts are slow c. Very very busy at weekends and evenings (early morning is amazing, its practically exclusive!)d. For non skiers its overpriced and boring (in my opinion)In summary: if you ski, board or want to learn it is fab.

Its good for what it is, but nothing compares to the real thing.Its ideal for learning on, or practicing your skills.You sometimes have to remember that you are in a indoor ski centre.I might go back again in the future, I have been now 3 times.My wife was away getting her nails done, so it filled in some time.Its funny when you see peoples reaction to snow, that have never experienced it.If you are in Dubai its worth going to see."

The cost is fairly inexpensive for what you get, but let me tell you... its all about the photos. They will not let you take your own photos. There is a photographer at every second, its good if you have the money to spend. For one photo they want 100 dirham, or for eleven they want 1000 dirham!!! A bit expensive if you ask me. The whole experience of petting and kissing the penguins is very cool. Just be warned about the photos."

I wasn't expecting much out of it, but was pleasantly surprised: it's well run, the snow is fairly good if a bit slushy and there is enough height gain and steep bits to be able to pick up some serious speed.The chairlift is painfully slow, but the other lift goes reasonably fast, I counted 18 rotations in 1h30. The gear they rent is good enough, and the clothing warm enough for a couple of hours in the fridge.It's not cheap at Dhs 200 (plus a nearly-mandatory 25 for a locker, as they won't let you have a backpack on the slopes, and you need somewhere to put your shoes and change of clothes) but worth it for a different experience, even for advanced skiers, though you'll probably get bored after an hour or so. It would be a great place for beginners, though."

When else can you be at the beach in 85 degree weather and then cool off snowboarding indoors. They provide the board, boots with socks, pants and jacket. You will need to bring your own gloves and hat. If I remember correctly they place a 20 Dirham hold on your card for the equipment which you receive back in cash when you are finished by returning your ski card pass into the automated machine on exit. The chairlift moves incredibly slow compared to typical ski hill chairlifts. If you have some experience I would recommend the tow rope that follows the wall up, it runs about twice as fast as the chairlift. It can be tricky on the snowboard as it makes a steep left turn in the middle, but if you relax and hold on it works out ok. Two hours is plenty of time here as you only have a choice of two runs, left or right."

You only have to buy the gloves but they only cost a couple of pounds. There were 6 people in my lesson group and we learned the basics such as putting on the skis, walking, starting, stopping and then finished with a mini slalom made from cones. It was great fun. If you have never been skiing before then you have to do a lesson. After this beginners class we graduated onto the next group which would have been a 90 minute lesson before being allowed to go it alone on the slopes. We were there in February when the temperature is a perfect 28 degrees. However I imagine Ski Dubai is a welcome break from the heat of the summer. I would definitely recommend it, excellent value for money on real snow in an indoor ski resort on a massive scale."

The Giant Ball and Mountain Thriller are really fun, it makes us scream and shout, the Chairlift ride gave us amazing view, really enjoyed it. Will definitely come back to have much more fun!"

You could see the ski lift ok and a couple of the other small children's rides. They also have a penguin show that you can see from the public space. You could go into a restaurant, pay for dinner and get a little better view. I'm glad I went to the attraction but I was a little disappointed in Ski Dubai."

We pre booked to save time and once through the mayhem that was getting suits and boots the ski slope access was great. Most of the problems were for people just going in to the non ski side. You have to be able to link turn and use a lift to go on the slopes. People obviously did not read this. I dragged one lad off the kill zone on the so called black because he was on his backside and unable to get up and ski down. Had to tell him to take skis off and walk in the end. Other just kept falling off the button lift, same ones every time. I told staff but no real marshals about. Advice use the button not the car it's twice as quick. The black is a red and only on one small stretch but it is a great run on sort of real snow and with the count down on the lift pass we kept racing to fit just one more run in. Take gloves and socks with you and I'm fully converted to helmets now which are available for free. It's the other idiots not you remember"

Both of us were prepared to have some sort of lesson, but not to this extent! I do not understand how most tourists have the time or the funds to fork out for these kinds of lesson.

Buy your tickets online at least 24hrs ahead of time and then check in at the will-call line to avoid the hassle of long lines. After check-in you will be given a wrist band and sent to the clothing and equipment line to pick up ski pants, jacket and boots. You can either bring your own hat, gloves/mittens and scarf or buy some fleece ones there. (Everything except hat, gloves and scarf is included in the price). Even if there is a line for the clothing, it moves very quickly. Make sure to know your clothing size in S/M/L/XL, etc. They have a conversion chart, so you just need to know your shoe size and the country you are from for ski boots. They do the conversion for you. There is a food court just outside the Ski Dubai entrance on the 2nd floor of the mall (they let you go in/out as much as you want during the day as long as you keep the wristband on and show it to come back in), as well as 2 coffee shops, one being Starbucks and the other a local chain. There are lockers in the bathrooms as well as in the common areas to keep your valuables in while skiing. They do require a deposit for the locker, but you can get it back by turning in the plastic key card at the end of the day (We turned ours in the next day and were still able the get the deposit back). After placing items in the lockers, you can claim your skis and hit the slopes. Overall, the process is very user-friendly, the workers are friendly and accommodating, and the skiing is fun with easy access to food at the top of the ski lift or in the mall outside of Ski Dubai. There are also fun activities for kids and a penguin exhibit, although we didn't participate in either of those and can't speak to those."

We viewed the attraction from seats by the window in the Cheesecake Factory where snow balls (more like human hamster balls) rolled right up to our table! Snow boards, tubing and skiing was being enjoyed by a varied crowd of different ages. Good fun!"

Shalini was so well versed in the culture and the stores that went along with it. She made our trip so much fun Our bus drive was terrific==getting that BIG RED bus around was really something. We truly had a wonderful experience and would like to return for a longer trip. The people in our tour were so friendly and helpful. I recommend this trip to this part of the world. PLUS there is NO crime here. You feel perfectly safe at all time. We were mesmerized by the lovely buildings. Pictures on internet just do not do them justice. LOVELY. Don't miss this trip to Dubai.

I wanted to go skiing in Ski Dubai since I learned the place exists, even I knew it will suck for skier of my skill (black slopes with ease) and it did. I consider this a must, even it's not much about skiing itself. Boots of my size didn't fit well, skis had poor maintenance, the snow itself is bad, the platter lift didn't work, the chairlift is so slow. But this is so unique (or bizarre) experience, none of this matters. I have NEVER seen a ski lift with support pole mounted to a ceiling :)I purchased ski passes on the spot with my MasterCard, which gave me a discount. Then I picked up boots, warm black socks, red and blue jacket and trousers. Then I got my Rossignol skis. I changed to my skiing outfit and packed my stuff into a locker. Just before entering the \"freezer\" I got my poles of desired length from a stand. Everything was fine and all our problems has been solved quickly by the helpful staff.Temperature was -3 \u00b0C. The lift got me to the top and I turned left, to the blue slope. Skis didn't go well and I struggled with them. Especially because my boots didn't fit tight on my foot (but crushing my shin), so I didn't have much of a control. Next round we went to the right and it was much better and with each round it got better and better. Last few rounds I can even talk about skiing :)Because the temp was close to what we have at home at the moment, we had a hat, gloves, sweater, turtle neck and stuff. Nevertheless after about 8 rounds (1 hour) we were freezing, so we decided to leave. It was really a unique experience."

The bobsled made my back hurt and it felt I though I was going to slip off, the tubing is ok but kinda silly that you have to go get your own tubes and bring it up to the starting point (shouldn't there be an employee that loads up the tubes on the belt??). It felt very disorganized when I got inside, I would line up for something and it would not be the activity I was looking for. The kids behind me were also asking me where to line up for tubing. I had to keep asking employees where to line up. I was also very annoyed at a family trying to do zorbing. The dad had his kids go under the turnstiles so I'm not even sure they scanned their passes. One of his kids was too short and was turned away. There's no employee at the beginning of the line to check if people have the right passes.It's also time consuming picking up all the equipment once you go inside and again not too organized. I wish it were more clear where go first, second, third, etc. Immediately after buying the ticket I was directed to the store, which is where I thought I could pick up all the equipment. I was wrong because you pick up gloves only in the store. I don't believe this was explained clearly in the beginning.The lady getting the equipment looked annoyed, I'm not sure I told her which size pants to get for me, she just went ahead and handed me the smallest ladies pants available. Then I had to make a second trip to get a size up. Also had to get smaller size shoes as sizing is not accurate.I wish I had skipped the snow park and just did the skiing."

The bobsleigh was exciting, the uneven rubber ring slope likewise, wall climbing, snowman building - all fun. There ws a little log cabin where you could get hot chocolate - we really needed that to warm up a bit. If you book the one hour ski lesson, the time flies. Access to the slope for the more experienced skiers looked like much greater fun. The penguin encounter was excellent, the guides blew us away with their knowledge and good communication skills. Very educational and fun but you get quite cold very quickly as you don't get to move much and you sit on frozen ledges for photos (your own camera is not allowed for the penguins encounter but it allowed elsewhere). I would advise to get really warm gloves and hats as the ones you buy there don't keep you very warm. They do provide snow boots, jackets and trousers but I found that I needed warmer stuff underneath as well. Fantastic place, I've been to Dubai three times and went to SkiDubai each time, and I will go each time I happen to be there."

The penguins where too cute and adorable! The only activity I didn't enjoy much was the huge rolling ball it was a bit painful and I didn't do much rolling in a huge ball not transparent enough to see anything. Do make sure you are wearing warm clothes the ones they offer you will only serve as a barrier for your clothes not to get wet. I would also recommend looking for coupons online or at your hotel's concierge for discounts which applies for all activities in Dubai."

Ski Dubai is an interesting place, and one that I was very much looking forward to visiting.We rocked up to the lady at the ticket counter, who perhaps could have been a little more informative, and managed to get into a Beginner lesson starting in about half an hour.Lessons are an hour and a half long and we felt the price, which includes all the gear except gloves, was pretty good value.We luckily had brought along our own pants and gloves so only needed to get a jacket, boots and skis. This part of the adventure was a bit slow, and we were pretty much left to our own devices as to where to go, what to do with everything and where to meet our instructor etc etc.Also the cashier had only charged us for and given us one locker ticket, so I had to line back up at the counter to get another one. It all took quite a bit of guesswork and time and we were running just a few minutes late for the lesson. Luckily it was just us and one other lady in the group so we didn't inconvenience too many people.Our instructor at first seemed a little abrupt, but soon warmed up. He was an excellent teacher and it really was the best ski experience I have had. We ended up with the skills to be able to ski down right from the top, which I never thought I would have been able to do.When we had finished he marched us back to the lobby area and presented us with our signed Lesson Passport that stated we had passed with flying colours.After this we desperately wanted to join in a lesson for Grade 1, but after checking the timetable found there is only a few each week and we had missed out. Unfortunately this meant our skiing was over for the trip. So disappointing, but our fault for not checking the lesson system and session times beforehand.We didn't partake in any of the other activities on the snow, but they all looked pretty fun.Also, there was a guy taking photos who gave the other lady in our group a slip of paper presumably saying he had taken photos of her. Not sure why he didn't take photos of us, not sure if you have to book a photographer or what but I would suggest just taking in your phone and doing your own happy snaps. Not that there was much time for this during the lesson!Quick Tips:Look online for lesson times. You need to meet their requirements before being able to ski on your own. Not sure how you can prove it without taking their lessons.Arrive nice and early! Could be chaotic if busy.Check your shoe size before hand. Bring thick socks instead of using their thin ones. Jackets have no pockets. (unsure about the pants)Ask the lady at the counter for cheap add-ons to your ticket. Peng Friends etc.Use Entertainer voucher for slope pass.Take in a tissue for runny cold noses. Return your lift ticket to a machine by the exit for a 20dh refund.And above all - see it for what it is, an indoor ski field in the desert. Enjoy the experience!!"

            "review": "Ski School - Think before you book. We recently took our children (now aged 6 & 8) for a \"Discovery\" ski lesson prior to taking them on their first ski holiday. It seemed like the perfect introduction: learn how to put boots & skis on and move safely on the snow, and maybe even a little snow-ploughing on a gentle slope. They did achieve this, hence a 2* rating.My gripes began before the lesson even commenced: Before booking, I asked if the kids could join a group together (ages are normally split 3-6, and 7-13). I was told there was only 1 chance to do that - it was an \"extra\" lesson not mentioned on the website or flyer - and so I booked. On arrival, the instructor advised that it wasn't possible as age limits are strict. This wasn't the end of the world for us, but annoying that staff don't know or communicate procedures amongst each other.Issue #2: timing. Lessons are only for 1 hour (and poor value for money at that). We were told to arrive an hour before the lesson, which we did. The children were fully clothed and equipped 25 minutes prior to the lesson, and sat sweating while they waited... for a lesson which started more than 10 minutes late, mainly due to other students arriving late. The class then arrived back at the school kiosk well within the lesson time. So for $40 each my kids experienced a maximum 40 minutes in the snow, not the hour they were expecting, and barely longer than the time they'd had to sit around waiting.Issue #3: equipment. The suits and boots we hired were in pretty good condition, but the skis were very poor. Helmets for kids also looked fairly new, but there is no attempt to sanitise these as they are shared around. No wonder there is an epidemic of headlice in Dubai schools.Issue #4: instruction. Since we experienced 2 different instructors, it is clear that standards are not universal. One was very good with the kids, remembered their names and gave feedback after the lesson. The other was entirely disinterested/distracted and clearly had something more important to occupy him for at least 20 of the minutes we were paying him to teach our child. We didn't even see him at the end of the lesson.Overall, it was an expensive and frustrating waste of time - we should have just waited for our holiday. We certainly won't be going back.The Ski Dubai venue is an incredible facility, given its location. The novelty value is enormous. But the ski school (for kids, at least) is not worth the effort or money."

But when in Dubai, I somehow needed to try this and I dont regret. You get all the equipment in the center except for the gloves. you have to buy those. I dindt and thought that I will be fine without. It was cold! The feeling is funny, they even have a cottage to have a drink. All in all very different experience."

Very nice experience. Best for kids. Buy tickets for skiing only if u know how to ski. Slide, chair lift, giant ball can be enjoyed in superpass which is for whole day. But when I visited it was bit crowded so difficult to repeat turn on chairlift and the giant ball etc. 2 hour time is more than enough. Though u can avail extra facilities in superpass but I didn't find it useful. To be inside ski Dubai is just amazing. After 1 hour your fingers starts getting numb. Chair lift ride not to be missed. Penguin sighting also very good though a bit lengthy. Coffee available both at bottom and Top of ski Dubai."

They tested her once inside to ensure she knew the basics otherwise she wouldn't have been able to ski w/o a lesson. My husband and daughter had a lot of fun. They provide ski suit, helmet, ski boots/skis as part of the rental fee. you can rent a locker to put your shoes in, you can 'gate check' your stroller for free. We were advised to bring hat and gloves from home but otherwise you can buy them there. FYI We heard ski lessons sell out a few days in advance as do the penguin encounters.

There are 2 skiing slopes, the easy one and one little bit harder, both the same length, some 300-400 meters. There are 2 ski lifts, one four seat and one cable. There were no crowds.If the focus is on bringing the mountain with snow into a desert in the middle of the shopping mall, then it would be 5 points. The Ski Dubai from the inside of the Mall of the Emirates, where it is situated, looks surreal. On one side of the glass you have people in T shirts eating or drinking in restaurants and watching through that glass the others skiing.The entrance fee is on a higher side. It starts somewhere from 200 Dirham (50 Eur) for 2 hours (which is more than enough), or you can choose a day pass. In the price is included everything, the ski suit, ski shoes, socks and skis of course.Gloves and cap IS NOT included, so bring your own in order to avoid buying them. The inside temperature is around -2, no wind, so it isn't cold that much.Ski Dubai participates in the Entertainer book, so DO buy it, and then you get 2 for 1 tickets.Beside skiing, inside you have another attractions paying extra, like zip riding, bob, meeting the penguins,...All in all it's an interesting experience to spend couple of hours in this unique place, if nothing else, just to see snow and skiers in a shopping mall."

The logistics of getting on your snow gear is a bit stressful and disorganized. None of us had the right size of clothes/boots at the start, so it took a good bit of time to gear up. Plan to rent a locker - there is no other place to keep your shoes. Bring your own hat and extra layers underneath, especially socks. The clothing they provide will hold you maybe 2 hours at most, and then you'll be very cold.We found the staff working the rides inside to be very difficult to communicate with. Lots of confusion on the chair lift and when we were to get off for the toboggan run. No assistance with how the passes work with the proximity readers to get around the park. We figured it out eventually, but it would have been helpful to be told.For the price paid, I would have expected a better experience all around. All of that said, it was a unique experience, and I'm glad we went to see the facility and enjoy a taste of winter. But I feel it was more of \"check it off the list\" event rather than truly fun family time."

The ticket prices vary depending upon what you would like to do . The tickets bought by me included free gloves and a single chair ride and was for a specific time limit. They also provide you for complete snow gear that is padded jackets, pants and shoes. However, make sure you take protective clothing too and be well prepared as it can get really cold in there.If you have strollers you can park it at the security office and they will give you a tag. After , passing a hurdle of getting ready between the crowd, it was a wonderful surprise , it was real snow and there are different area like free play area, some rides like carousel, chair lift ride , skiing area etc. You can come out for a while and go back in again if you feel cold.

To start with the queues at the ticket counter should be managed better as I felt it took plenty of time just to buy the tickets. Then again it took some extra time in getting your shoes, ski clothing etc. The inside of the ski resort is great. Its great that someone has made such a snow resort almost in a desert. Since we just visited the snow park we felt that the rides were pretty less as compared to the price which we had paid for the tickets. Again rides/activities should be managed better. One has to collect his/her tube etc himself and then bring all the way up to have that ride. You have to keep going up and down for this. And if you are with kids it becomes difficult. This goes for all the activities. This should be automatic or have some manpower to do so. Overall a good experience but make sure you wear good clothing as the jackets they provide are pretty thin and its freezing inside."

There is proper snow, and everyone there looked like they were having fun! They have a large slope for more advanced skiers, and lots to do.

Seems kind of chaotic getting the clothing gear and finding a locker when it was so many people. MAKE SURE YOU CHECK YOUR SKI SUIT POCKETS FOR THE CARDS TO GET YOUR DEPOSIT BACK. There were couple of teen boys checking pockets of pile of ski suits in a return bin. They found a couple of cards and went to the machine and got cash refund deposit. Although they were caught but it probably doesn't stop anyone from coming through to check. They don't have any barrier that would keep non-paying people out of the area. Anyone can walk through the area except the ski area.The penguin were cute but it was too cold to be standing there watching their cuteness so we went bobsledding and on the chairlift, etc. If possible bring some thicker gloves the free mittens they give you won't keep your hand warm."

My brother in law with his 9 and 13 year old are visiting.So we were told 4 days ago that you don't need to book in advance just get there as it opens.We were very disappointed on arrival to find out the penguin experience is fully booked for the next 4 days. Our visitors leave in two days. 4 upset kids, 4 angry parents.Ok well at least the 300dhs package includes a ski lesson and access to all rides. We're planning on a full day so lets do it.30 minutes wait just to get boots and clothing. To then be told we need to be back 45 minutes before our lesson to change our boots. That will be right now then. Why didn't you say that in the first place. Another 40 minutes to change boots and get our skis. So we've been here just under 2 hours and we're still not inside the dome. Wait for the instructor to then have our 3 year old taken off with one group our 5 year old and 7 year old with another group and the adults another. What so we book a lesson for 7 of us and we're all split up. We were not told in advance.No idea where our kids are. Can't see them from where we are on the slope. 1000s of people and no idea how they intend to ensure the kids end up with the correct parents at the end of the lesson.So I'm a little angry and trying to lissen to the instructor who's rushing through things and having tot deal with 4 complete idiot adults in the group who refuse to lissen or wait for people have there practice.I'm on my third run just getting the hang of it and another instructor who is obviously giving a private lesson to 2 kids decides to walk straight across my path. If he had of been on his own I would have intentionally plowed right into him. But the kids were not to blame so I had to intentionally fall over.That's it I've had enough 20 minutes of dealing with this crap. Explained my anger to the instructor, Skis off left them where they were to emphasize my anger and walked off to find my kids. Thankfully they were having a great time.Wife did the full lesson and it didn't get any better.Another 30 minutes waiting to change our boots again!!!!!!!Time for a coffee and a chillout.What I can't go back into the slope to the small cafe because my lesson is over.I have to go outside to the big and might I add full cafe.So I've been here 3 1/2 hours and only done 20 mins!!!!!!!!!!Had my coffee let's try again.In we go join the Que for the small tabogan. 30 minutes later. 20second ride. Join the Que for the ski lift. 30 minutes.20 minutes wait for the larger tabogan.Get to the bottom ques are now massive. There still letting people in....40 minutes waiting for a the large ball ride and the kids ask if we can go home. To bloody right we can go home.We were looking forward to a good day with the kids but instead not only did we despise the experience. Our 5 year old ended up saying \" I'm not having fun can we go home.\".My brother in-law booked a lesson for his wife and kids and then paid for slope passes for them all. After he had paid anf the kids knew what to do he was then informed they can't go on the slope they need more lessons. The slopes for professionals. So why the he'll did you sell me the passes. Refund and complaint time.If you like paying money to watch people be completely disorganized and inefficient. Missleading and none informative. Have your blood pressure raised and patience tested then this place will be perfect for youshall not return and shall advise others to avoid the place.Such a shame."

Both myself and a friend were highly dissatisfied with the lesson. Our instructor shouted during the lesson continuously. He was bullying and would not let my friend try for herself, but instead held her jacket at the lower point of the beginner's slope. When she didn't hear instructions at the back of the group he refused to repeat. Very little ski time, spent most of the lesson waiting around. In addition, the lesson started late and ended early.

There is also a nursery slope for beginner lessons.The slopes can be accessed by a drag lift or a four person chair lift. There were a lot of none skiers going up on the chair lift which was a bit weird. Skis, jacket, socks, trousers and boots were all included. Hats and gloves were available to buy fairly cheaply.The shortest pass was for two hours.

Previously you could pay a nominal fee to go in, throw snowballs and visit the ice structures - this no longer exists. The basic package was circa 200AED per person and now offers activities such as sitting on a ski lift or being in a snow dome (which your child might not be able to do but you have to pay).

I choose the full ticket of 500 dirhams which gives access to all activities including the penguin encounter, we also got free lunch and hot chocolate drinks with the tickets. Money and time well spent."

Visiting over the festive period, it had this holiday spirit and feel about it. Not once did I believe that I was actually standing in icy temperatures in the middle of the desert. It felt as if though I was in Europe. The variance of people from around the globe added to the charm and grandeur of the place. Dressed in My Ski Dubai outfit, I undertook my journey onto the ski slopes. I wasn't disappointed and so were the 100's of visitors around me. I must say, it was really cold and within half an hour of standing inside, I was frozen. It helps to purchase a warm hat for your head and ears. The Ski cable took a while to reach the top but was worth the journey upwards. For an experience out of the ordinary I would suggest it anytime for visitors to Dubai. The snow had a pretty real feel about it too and it all adds up to an amazing time in Dubai. Look forward to visiting it soon again :)"

I generally use the attraction early in the morning and it's always empty with perhaps 20 other people on the slopes. it's beginning to look a little unloved and scruffy now which doesn't affect the ski-ing but the whole experience isn't as good as it once was - the cable car to the top of the slope is painfully slow too."

When you enter inside and see everything thats when you realise that you have been fooled like a small kid who bought a big expensive chocolate box with just a small piece of chocolate inside. You have to pay extra on extra to go other rides after just few kiddo rides. The only fascinating thing about the place is how they make snow in desert.

It's not appreciably any different to indoor slopes I've used elsewhere and certainly still a long way from an outdoor experience in any kind of ski resort. The lift queues have been reasonable when I've been there but it's a very simple slope to ski on - simple for beginners but no variation or challenge beyond that. It does get cold and although the gloves are ok the coats offer little insulation so take something warm to wear."

I skiied once 10 years ago but haven't since so I was a little nervous about getting back in it but the instructors were so friendly and I felt totally at ease. They really are a credit to this place. Also reception are very helpful and friendly!I booked my lessons online before - I'd definitely recommend doing this as it's quicker and you have a guaranteed spot. They give you everything apart from gloves. I bought my own ski gloves and a thick pair of socks I wear with normal boots at home- they gave me a thin free pair of socks but it's -4 in there so i don't recommend these! I wore leggings and a tshirt and was not cold at all - I was skiing though so this might be different if you are in the snow park and not doing a whole lot of exercise.The only downside is that the mall isn't that great - but hey not their fault at all!Thank you ski Dubai for such a great afternoon!"

I had taken a lesson once before but many years ago, so I don't consider myself a skier. Your snowsuit, gloves, ski boots and skis are included. The instructor was nice and kept the group laughing. There were 8 people in the group including ourselves. We must have been having a real good time because the lesson was over before we knew it. After the lesson we returned our ski boots and traded them in for regular snow boots before going into the snow park. The snow park was a lot of fun, we felt like kids. We went snow tubing, bobsledding, rolled down a hill in a \"snow ball\" and rode the chair lift. I feel the price is good considering all the inclusions. We had a great time and wished we would've spent more time here but we were pressed for time."

At first I could not believe my eyes, there really was snow inside of the mall! Not only snow, there were ski lifts, big plastic balls for snow fun, amusement rides, sledding, penguins and much, much more! The place was full with people of all ages inside having the time of their lives. Everyone that we saw were laughing, kids were playing and it was one of the best places we had seen on our trip. They do offer ski lessons if you have never skied before or just go and play in the snow. Dressing warm is a must. If you do not have enough warm clothes and socks you can easily buy them at their gift shop or in the mall. They also have a coffee shop if you need to take a rest and warm up. If you don't want to ski or go into the the attraction you can view it from the outside and take photos or visit their store for souvenirs. It is worth seeing for sure. The location is in The Mall of the Emirates."

There are several packages to choose from depending on your budget, and if you're a first timer. Kids will like the penguin experience wherein they get to see, touch and take pictures with the penguin.Ski dubai is a park that can entertain the whole family. Theres an area for experienced skiers (i am not one of them, obviously), coffee shops for those who want to thaw out, and various activities like slides and zorbing. I recommend getting the package that allows you to sit on the chair lift so that you can see the whole view of the park.One thing's for sure: the skidubai-provided gear was not enough to keep us warm. 30 minutes later, our toes were freezing up. Make sure to bring your own (if you have it) warm wooly socks, weatherproof boots and gloves, a wooly hat and earmuffs. Remember, the warmer you are, the longer you can stay in the park. It took us 2 hours before we felt like our noses will fall off and some of our friends gave up 30 minutes in.Bundle up and enjoy!"

The suits and shoes given are clean and hygienic and good enough to keep you warm inside.The rides including ski lessons are worth the buck. The best part is the helpful and smiling staff, amazing.

The instructors and marshalls are really helpful and the standard of tuition is very good, I learned to ski competently in about 3 1.5 hour lessons, and the prices are reasonable too - a lesson costing 230 Dhs (about \u00a340) and a 2 hour pass 200 Dhs (about \u00a335).Obviously it's not a mountain indoors. But it's been set up by people who know their stuff to give a good range of skiing environments to learn and practice on. I really rate it for anyone living here who want to learn to ski and have an enjoyable hobby in Dubai.Can't comment on the snow park, never been, looks way too tacky for me.

A decent slope, with some variation half way down, in a surreal touristy atmosphere comprising fake log restaurants, small cresta run, sliding on tyres and even a pool with periodic penguin visits. I just stuck to the skiing. It takes 4 mins to go up the poma and ski to the bottom (the chairlift is very slow). Not that many people were skiing (midweek in September) even though the place was busy - most were doing the other activities and riding up the chairlift to come back down on it (including the obligatory \"buy your photo from the booth\" stunt). Around 200Dh for 2hrs, 300 Dh for the day, including equipment is pretty good in this city of excesses! 20% discount for mastercard when I used it.

To make it more fun for young adults that don't want to ski, they should include more rides/activities, which will mean they will need to expand.Beware, the photographers are VERY ANNOYING! We took a photo before and after like every ride.I agree with the reviews that said it was very cold when you're inside (it was -3 degrees Celsius). So if you are sensitive to the cold, wear a hat, a scarf, 2 gloves (my hands were still cold with 2 gloves), and a jacket underneath. The jacket and pants they provide are not enough if you are not used to the cold. Also, you can carry a phone or camera inside."

Staff are friendly and efficient, it is well organised. Equipment is pretty new but basic. Gloves, goggles and hat are not included. You can purchase but I went without. Temperature is freezing but mild and of course there's no wind. I put my hands in my jacket and warmed my ears when they got cold. Personal preference here. This is not the place to learn how to ride so you'll need to have some experience as lift operators look pretty oblivious and are off to the side. After a quad chair lift up a dog leg, you get to the top. One wide blue run splits to 2, black run to the right (which is more red than back and is a short 50m) or continue around for blue which meets for the end stretch which is a hard green/easy blue. I arrived just before opening at 10 and glad I did as it started to get busy around 12. I never needed to wait for the lift as there was no line ups during this time.

Snow will always be exciting for someone like me that came from a near equatorial area.I experienced playing with snow many times and it never cease to excite me.I been to Dubai like 5 times already and my visit to Ski Dubai was the third, one to experience the snow park and two to try skiing. Ski Dubai might be artificial as a snow park and as a ski resort but the amazement and thrill was just the same as the real thing. Seasoned skiers will always say that it is more difficult to Ski on not so fresh snow and given the circumstances that it is enclosed and feels like in a giant freezer but who's complaining, it's located inside a huge mall in a desert oasis of UAE. It is very convenient. You can shop do sand dunes bashing, shopping or sunbathing in the Gulf's coastline after skiing. I can consider myself a beginner and needs more practice.I would love to go back to comeback and do it again. All the spills and crashes were all worth it.Thank you Ski Dubai for reminding all of us that we need to follow all the safety precautions. Continue to promote safe snow sports in a place where snow is next to impossible. Than"

There are two main slopes, one for advanced and one for intermediate and they are both pretty long. There is also a ski instructor for those who haven't mastered the basics. However there isn't anything in between - we hadn't skied for 10 years and it would be have been great if we could have had a quick go on a smaller slope first to get our confidence. Having said that I loved it and would definitely recommend going. Staff are all very helpful. They supply boots and clothing but you have to buy your own gloves in the shop (you can also buy a hat if you want). There are lots of caf\u00e9s and some rides for kids, plus of course you are smack bang in the middle of the Mall of the Emirates (which you pretty soon forget as you head up to the top of the slopes on the chairlift)! If you like to ski this is definitely worth a visit - it's one of the things we want to do again if (when!) we come back to Dubai."

We bought our teenage son the 500 aed ski Dubai experience which included absolutely everything from the snow park to the zip line to the snow balls to the skiing to free hot chocolate, locker, gloves and a set menu at the St Moritz Caf\u00e9 to the penguin experience. This was definitely worth it for him.Mind it was absolutely freezing and I should have worn something a bit warmer than shorts under my ski suit which was provided by Ski Dubai. Take your own gloves and hats as you will need to pay for these. The socks they provide are a bit flimsy and did not really do the job of keeping your feet toastie.A fab day we spent here and I would definitely recommend it for a fun family day out."

            "review": "Winter Wonderland, for a Price. As someone who loves winter and hates the heat, this was an incredibly welcome outing. I went to Ski Dubai with my company and only had two hours at the park, but easily could have spent more time there.However, had I not had this excursion paid for by the company, I don't think I would have gone. It is $60 for two hour access to the park which includes a jacket, snow pants, and snow boots. However, the jacket is much too thin for the temperature of the park (-4C) and unless you came prepared with a thick fleece or sweater and long pants, you will not be adequately dressed and will likely be extremely uncomfortable. I also suggest bringing a scarf. If you want gloves or a hat, you have to purchase them ($5 and $16 respectively). If you want a locker (which is quite small), you have to rent one ($5).If you want to see the penguins, that's an additional $43. And while the penguin encounter was absolutely wonderful, they DO NOT permit cameras. If they didn't want flash for fear of disturbing the animals, I might understand. But the park provides a photographer who takes photos with a very bright flash, so the camera ban is only in place so that the park can charge you $30 for ONE COPY of A SINGLE PHOTO. The photographer doesn't even wait to see if you're ready to have your photo taken and rushes through taking the pictures. You've already paid to see the penguins and get into the park. Charging that much for the only photo you could possibly have of the experience is nothing short of robbery and they should be completely and utterly ashamed of themselves. If they were to charge even $10 for a photo (which is still pretty absurd), they would still be making far more than the cost of printing a single photo, without completely gouging their customers.All in all, that is over $150 for ONE PERSON for two hours, not including any food purchases you may wish to make. So yes, it was a lovely evening and I had a great time, but if you asked me to shell out that kind of money myself for the novelty of seeing snow while in the desert for two measly hours, I would laugh in your face.I would rather spend that kind of money on an experience unique to the Middle East, like a desert safari for example, than pay to experience something I can do for free at home come December."

The slide is very uneven in places and covered with protruding mats. Additionally, the entrance to this ride is very badly marked and the staff allowed us (women with a 3 yr old child) to walk across the busy ski path, unaided to reach the beginning. This was only after asking one staff member if we could go across and he didn't even bother to turn around and see what we were doing. We were allowed to enter the queue for the big tube slide that lauches a tube into the air and onto a huge inflatable mattress. With my child being only 3 yrs old this was a shock (of course we didn't continue). Areas were very unclearly marked, there are no directional signs and staff could not speak English. Additionally, it is very unclear who is allowed on what ride/where. Staff also allowed small children to enter on the request of their parents (even though they were clearly well below the age requirements). In general, a very unpleasant experience with too many people, clothing and shoes lying all over the entrance area, too little sleds, too little snow, pushing and shoving, long queues blocking certain areas and general confusion. It's expensive, chaotic and unsafe. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone with children."

            "review": "Interesting to see once, penguin visit is fun. While the idea of snow in the desert is conceptually cool, in reality Ski Dubai is overpriced and not particularly exciting if you are from a place where snow is readily available (we live in the U.S.). Since we were there with a 2 year old, we elected to do the penguin encounter (note you have to reserve a time in advance, so it is difficult to find an immediate open time if you just show up). The encounter itself was short (15 min), but it was fun to sit next to and even touch a real penguin. The whole place is like a Disney attraction, so you are extorted for money at every turn. We were charged 25 AED for a locker to store our shoes. No cameras were allowed inside the encounter, so we had to pay 150 AED just to get physical and digital versions of 2 photos of our daughter with the penguin. All of this is on top of the 150 AED per person for the experience itself. Since we were burning through cash on this part alone, we elected not to pursue the skiing. The park itself is small and probably not worth the money or time for adults without kids. Overall, this is an interesting place to see, but nothing special. The penguin encounter is different and you do get up close with a real penguin, so if you are willing to pay it's a fun, albeit short, diversion while avoiding the sweltering heat."

I only brought some knit gloves and my hands were really cold, so I would highly recommend bringing better gloves and a hat. There are some other activities here for the kids, and I saw several families just riding up the lift together (not skiing) for a fun little trip in the cold. I enjoyed my morning here very much and would recommend it as one of the fun and random things to do in Dubai. There is a lovely hot chocolate cafe on the hill, but I forgot to bring cash in, so I didn't get to partake - they serve a bit of food as well."

            "review": "Great ski school. I decided to give ski another try, after a failed attempt in a ski resort few years ago. I thought I am unable to ski, but the instructors in this school proved me wrong. I had different instructor for each lesson, which was good, as they had different tricks or stiles to teach students. They all speak good English and have good teaching skills, so I am very pleased with the services and with my progress. First classes tend to be busier, as more students attend discovery or beginner lessons, then they afterwards attend the intermediate lessons. And while there were 10 of us at first, I ended up having the intermediate lessons with 2-3 more people at max (that could partially be explained due to Ramadan, as the slopes were overall quiet). Cloths and ski gear are provided, you only need to bring gloves and hat. And you do need them, as it feels really cold once in the snow for an hour! The jacket has no pockets, so be prepared to leave everything in the lockers (that are available for 20 dhs). As an indoor facility, it creates the perfect ski environment without feeling too small. An experienced skier might think otherwise, but for lessons and for practice afterwards it is very good. I can only compare it with the Xanadoo slope in Madrid (the only indoor slope that I have seen before), and Ski Dubai is better.Before planning to go for lessons or just on your own for the exercise, it would be advisable to check the penguins show schedule, as it gets excessively crowded with families and teenagers who come in hundreds to see the penguins. Once I have learned my lesson, I planned to get there immediately after the shows started, and the queues for ticket and ski gear counters were a lot shorter."

Just the very fact that an indoor ski area complete with ski slopes of different difficulty levels, to cater to the beginners as well as experienced skiers, with its own cable car which ferries skiers ( and non skiers) up the slopes is awe inspiring. Add to that professional instructors who teach kids as well as adults the nuances of skiing or snowboarding, Penguins who strut around for 15 min shows, enough rides to keep kids and adults interested and ice carvings of dragons, horses and monuments(the Taj was on display when we were there), all in all guarantee everyone a great outing indeed. They provide you everything including socks, gloves, thermal wear and shoes with lockers to house your stuff. So just go as you are(no specific clothing required) and have yourself a taste of winter wonderland in the heat of the Dubai summer or pretty much anytime."

We were on the chairlift within 20 minutes. The lift is painfully slow, but the run itself was pretty decent. I would consider it an easy/intermediate for those who ski often.

Ski Dubai was a complete surprise package amid the sweltering heat that we were experiencing. They maintain a temperature of 2 to 3 degrees Celsius.. and outside its like 48 degrees. Its amazing. The ticket pinch a bit when you are buying them... but once you are inside you do understand why it is so. The kids had a real good time as it was a first for most of them. they took almost all the rides possible. But I have to say, you need to be really brave to be inside the place for more then 3 Hours. The Ski Dubai also has a great view from the cheese cake factory and other restaurants in the Mall of the Emirates. Over all a great experience for people who don't get to enjoy snow on a regular basis."

In a recent trip to Dubai with my wife we pre-booked via email a Penguin experience which seemed quite odd to be leaving the searing heat of the summer to the freezing temperatures inside. Ski Dubai is located at one end of the Emirates mail so is quite easy to travel to by the Metro and find upon arrival at the second largest but still huge shopping mail. Upon arrival you are giventhe required snow suits and gloves etc. before using the lockers to store any personal items that are not required. At the allotted time one of the handlers took us through to a small briefing roomwhere we were shown a short but humorous film about penguins before being told some interesting facts as well as some do\u2019s and do not\u2019s about the experience. We were then escorted througha couple of door\u2019s and gates to meet Sneezy and Pebble\u2019s who are both Gentoo Penguin\u2019s. The handler chatted to us briefly before aided by his bucket of fish got both of them to walk onto therocks so we could all have our photo\u2019s taken with them by the official photographer who had now joined us. At one end of this area was a large pool with a large amount of penguins swimmingaround in. We then went onto to meet the largest penguin of them all who\u2019s name escapes me but was a King Penguin. The format was similar only this time as he was not so nervous you wereable to touch/pet or even kiss if you wanted to. After returning back to get changed you are then given the opportunity to purchase the pictures that were taken in various price bands.Like most things in Dubai this was not cheap and it would have been better if it was possible to take our own photo\u2019s but if you are looking for something different to do we would recommend you try this experience."

The price of admission gets you a \"Ski jacket and pants\" along with boots and skis rental. Hint - bring a hat and your own gloves or you will freeze! Another, the clothes are very well worn so if you're a germaphone, beware! The inside of the building is fabricated to resemble a ski lodge with a single lift taking you to the top of an L shaped slope that gives you the option of 2 slopes to ski down. The \"snow\" is fairly icy and requires some pushing, but the overall experience is worth it just to witness the locals in Arab garb wrapped in head to toe down ski blankets riding the lift round and round. All in all, how can you visit Dubai and not say you've been here."

Given the high entry charge - they should have had some more attractions. Another limitations is that the layer of snow is very thin, you cant really play with snow the way you would if were real, unless of course you go to the skiers terrain. However, it is managed well - costumes are clean, boots are good and staff helpful. One should remember two things here: 1. carry your own woolen cap to survive the cold for longer duration, as that is not available at snowpark and 2. Your day pass allows multiple entry, so enjoy for a while then get out to the mall for food and warmth, and come back again."

The slope is very simple and perhaps too boring for extended periods of time for experienced skiers (like my boyfriend), but it was perfect for beginners and a great way to escape the heat of Dubai in summer. I had literally just burned my feet (blisters!) on the beach, so cooling down was exactly what we needed. They provide your jacket, pants, boots, socks, skis, poles and 2 hours of skiing in the 200 dirham ($50 USD) fee. You have to purchase your own gloves and hats if you want them. The temp inside is pretty darn cold, so I'd recommend getting the gloves and hats. The quality of the snow is pretty amazing, because they don't chip ice...they use a system which allows them to seed snow clouds indoors. Yes, they make it snow.People who don't ski can play in the snow and do inner tubing down certain sections. They also offer zipline rides from the halfway point on the slope to the bottom. It was such a unique, fun thing to do, and certainly a welcome respite from June's soaring temperatures outside."

Winter shoes they are providing are very wet and stuffed with dirty socks. They don't try it after the previous users. My question: how do they maintain hygen?(if they have it)Take your own winter socks, gloves and hat and your winter jackets. It will help to fight the cold. Visitors there was very rude to each other's and especially to staff. No mercy, no sorry for anyone around. Everyone first and ahead of the rest in queues. Coffee shop on the way to the top is really cool. Nice and cozy design, not bad food. But most amazing staff and service. Had perfect service from Jagat. Colleagues on the ZipLine also really helpful and full of enthusiasm. Especially the African guy from South Africa (Tsitsikama area). Just because of these guys and their service we will come back again and again. Had some fun, got freezes in wet shoesOne more thing: for those of you who come from the countries where snows at least once a year - Ski Dubai might be boring and snow unreal. "

It was a dream-come-true moment for my 2 kids as we'd been planning to go & this offer came along with thrills galore for my birthday boy. Entering through a cave was enough to capture our imagination. We had a photo taken with the amazing ice dragon for our souvenir package. The tobogganing & tubing were awesome! Kids simply love going up & down. The Penguin Parade is not to be missed. Pumpkin was super friendly & came really close to us. A free Zorf Ball ride was the icing on the cake (would've been the chairlift actually but my little girl wasn't ready to get on it). Of course we had a snow fight & I pulled them on the sled. They also pulled themselves up a hill. That 1st time we tropical people lasted a little over an hour. Just last May we took our friend there to celebrate his 9th birthday & we lasted almost 2 hours! A good sweater & gloves help. Don't forget your camera & wallet in case you want to to add-on activities as you go along. On both occasions we ended it with a scrummy late lunch at St. Moritz Cafe. Thank you, Ski Dubai for making an 8 year old boy's birthday surprise so spectacular! We'll definite bring our visitors who'd never experienced real snow there."

You are provided with skis, snowsuit, socks, gloves and snow boots when you buy your tickets at reception and refreshments are also available here. Use your ski pass to gain access to the chair lift, where you can alight at the smaller slope and enjoy a coffee, or those who are experienced enough can continue to the highest point and ski to the bottom. Children can participate in the snow school, zip wire and sorbing are amongst other activities besides skiing. You can also visit penguin breeds in the penguin centre, situated below Ski Dubai. Make sure you also have time to explore the shopportunity inside Mall of the Emirates. Buy souvenir photos of your experience on your way out! I live in Sheffield, United Kingdom where the local ski resort has closed as a result of recent arson attacks on the site.

They will even provide the warm gear & boots!This was a great (secret?) option for us to get the full experience without spending too much time or money! :)"

My 2, aged 12 and 15, had never been on skis before and had their first ever ski lesson here, they absolutely loved it. They both managed to ski down (and stay upright) a small slope at the end of their lesson.The chair lift is a great way to see just how big it is inside, and the kids had a great time in the big balls and inner tubes. A really fun afternoon.Would advise taking a warm hat and good gloves and thick socks if you are going to be there for a while, as our feet were absolutely frozen when we left.Very enjoyable and kids keen to go again for another ski lesson!!"

Also suggest using 'Entertainer' vouchers, to buy 1/get one free for 2hr session. Unfortunately, when we went the chairlift wasn't working & we needed to take the T-bar on the left-hand side, which is a bit challenging for novices.To get a good feel for the run, check out 'Ski Dubai BrettP' on YouTube, from our visit in April 2014."

So my initial reaction was the experience was expensive for a touristic experience. It was roughly $100+ USD once you add in the cost of gloves and hat (which will definitely need).But I decided to shut off the logical part of my brain and decided to say what the heck and try it out for a couple of hours.  It was well worth it. It was good fun and an anachronistic ski experience. It seems so out of place in the midst of Dubai but they replicate the ski experience quite nicely. Also, it draws an eclectic group of people which makes for a load of interesting observations and conversations to be had (e.g. an airline steward who flew to Dubai for 1 day to meet with friends to snowboard) The skiing wasn\u2019t anything amazing. But what was amazing was the system of organization and the fluidity that they built around their entire indoor skiing world. From an assembly line approach to distributing ski clothes and fitting of boots to the scanner that tracks to the minute how much time you had left on your 2 hour ski adventure.  The slopes were short and there were only 2 options -- It took me a grand total of about 90 seconds to get down the \"Black\" slope. But over 2 hours, I had nearly 10 - 15 runs and reminded that I'm actually looking forward to skiing in the East Coast of the US again in half a year.My verdict: Well worth the time and money. And certainly is a great photo opportunity to text/email to friends as well."

There is a little hot chocolate cafe inside, plenty of options to have your photo taken and be charged stupid amounts for souvenir pics and things for young and old to keep the whole family busy.

From the very beginning, the lady that sold me the tickets had an arrogant attitude. I'm sorry I don't know anything about the place, or the prices, but then again, that's why people like you is there! to help! ( she sent me to a board to read the prices myself, I've never met someone so useless and she wasn't busy at all) . Once I bought my ticket I had literally no idea were to go next. Following the rest of the people I found the place were they give you the jacket and pants. With all of that stuff in my hands (a big ball of clothes) I went to the next step which is getting the boots, then the snowboard, then with all that heavy stuff I went to the lockers where I couldn't find anywhere to sit down, so I sat on the floor.Once inside, the snow is perfect, everything looks beautiful and clean. I wanted to do snowboarding but I've only done it a couple of times so I decided to go to the \"beginners\" section. Just to find out there is no beginners, only medium and expert. After almost braking all my bones going down the hill I finally reached the end. I couldn't get my snowboard out of my feet so looking everywhere I was trying to find someone to help me (all this while fast ski and snowboard experts coming down the hill were trying not to run over me). Thank God I found a member of the staff which again very rudely took my snowboard off without saying a word or even looking at me (a chubby woman with blue eyes and dirty blonde hair, I wish I could mention your name) :) . As if I wasn't embarrassed enough, carrying my heavy snowboard I just wanted to leave so AGAIN without knowing where to go (PUT SOME SIGNALS IN THAT PLACE PLEASE!) I just started walking towards an \"exit\" signal. Then someone stopped me (literally grabbed my arm) and said \"to go out, that way, straight\". I swear I said thank you to that guy. Since at least he helped me, avoiding me to queue for the Big Ball when I all wanted to do was leave that place. Once out I realized there are also places you can just walk and take pictures, and wooden bridges. Ski Dubai is very very confusing. There are different tickets, or passes and once inside you find out there are things you can't do and If you want to do them you need an special pass...it's just exhausting. I left feeling I wasted money, not because of ski Dubai itself but due the terrible staff they have inside. I met this guy, Daniel, He doesn't work there but he helped me so much. He's a regular there. He advice me to take some lessons and also were to go to buy them. You could feel his passion for snow sports and for ski Dubai. You should hire people like him and let those grumpy others go."

Located in the Mall of the Emirates I had more fun than a 54 year old fat man should have! Everything is well thought out and your get your gear, gloves coats lockers boots etc all for one price. You can buy passes for whatever you like and the combo passes are great. I spent a few hours, tobogganing, sledding riding the chairlifts and just having a good time in this amazing architectual wonder, Music is piped in , you can stop on the slope for cocktails or hot chocolate or you can watch the diners and tourists in the mall oogle your every move! Throw a snowball at someone who cares it feels good after a long day in Dubai. The cost is pricey but worth every penny. Take the kids and enjoy. there were lots of photo ops everywhere and you can by the pics when you leave. This place was very well done and there is something for everyone to do there . Beat the heat here,go to the beach then come back again as your pass is good all day!"

My friend and I took part in the pass that permits a chair lift ride, unlimited \"zorb\" rides and tubing. We had a fun time, played in the snow a bit like kids again, and really enjoyed it! They have a bar at the top of the chair lift. You can opt for either kids area, skiing, or other passes- they cater to the activities you want to participate in. They provide gloves, socks, boots, jackets, pants, etc so you need NOTHING, which is great, since when you vacation to the desert you really don't plan on packing your gloves. A private locker is available to place your belongings. Price is very reasonable as well- about $60 for a variety pass. Good for adults, kids alike."

You are not going for the challenging expert terrain but you are going to marvel at the great effort that has been made to create a winter wonderland in the midst of not only a desert but a mega-mall. For about US$60, all you need to bring is a hat and pair of gloves, which you definitely will need! If you forget to pack them, do not worry as there is an adjacent store offering hats, gloves, scarfs, and may other items with Ski Dubai on them. Then you will then be efficiently outfitted with boots, poles, skis, jacket, pants and socks (I recommend using the 2 that they give you!) and lift ticket good for 2 hours. You can also purchase an all-day ticket or more expansive ticket that includes the other snow activities, such as the zip line, luge and huge snowball slide. Also, there is a ski school in case you have those that are just learning. Couple suggestions: Two hours was plenty of time for us. We went on a Friday morning which definitely was a less crowded time and therefore, shorter lines for everything. We shared a locker between 3 of us."

That was fine but after three hours in the area, I was ready to call it quits. They have an area for children to play in the snow and some rails for the snowboarders, etc.The price was fairly reasonable as well for what you get. They have ski instructors that are sent to Germany to certify. I've heard they are okay for what they have to teach (me being a former instructor my self - O would have LOVED to train in Germany!). Also, seeing woman ski in a burka... interesting to say the least. Give yourself a half of a day here and take a break from the ridiculous heat of Dubai in the summer!

We were able to pet, hug, kiss and feed many penguins. The tour was very informative and interactive. We did not purchase an all inclusive pass because we didn't have time to do the Snow Park. Really, I don't think we missed too much. Basic Information: Upon check in- I found the male attendent very rude! Of course, no name badge. However, we didn't let him spoil our trip! We brought our own gloves and hats. Wear your socks as well as the socks they provide to keep your feet warm! Children must wear helmets. It is cold of course! We arrived at 12:15 for a 1:00 tour. We were told to arrive at 12:15 but then had to wait until 12:30 to start changing out. Get there in plenty of time! Of course, lockers will cost extra. It takes time to change yourself and kids into snow gear. We met right at 1:00 at the Penguin Area. The tour guide, Gene, took us back right away. We met one Penguin type and learned all about him. then we met a different type and learned about her. Afterwards, we went to the penguin area and spent some time looking at their schedules, their food preparation, and their \"bedroom.\" We went up into their swim area and spent a lot of time interacting with them. Of course, their was a photographer taking lots of pictures. And, of course, you can buy these pictures for $100+. We did! After visiting with the penguins, Gene took us out to the penguin parade. My boys were able to go help with the parade and this made them feel very special. We finished the tour with some complimentary hot chocolate while sitting at the local restaurant. Overall, it was a great experience. My boys were very interested and amazed with the penguins. I think it depends on the children as to whether or not the Peng Friend Exclusive Tour is worth it. Like I said, it is pricey...the 4 of us was over $500. My boys did indicate that they wanted to play in the snow park...but we enticed them with visiting the mall stores instead! I just don't think we could handle the cold long enough to make it worth our money- which is why we spent more on the penguins. For us, this was the right choice. Before leaving, don't forget to turn your cards back in for the 20 AED deposit each! Visit the photo place to get your pictures and pay for any extra that you would like. Our package included 4 printed pictures, presented in a nice booklet. Additionally, we bough the USB of all our images. Pricey- but a once in a lifetime experience for us!"

The ski slope is not very long and quite a simple one but one needs to understand it\u2019s an indoor show park and therefore bound have its limitations. Once you understand and accept the limitations you are going to enjoy the experience. You need about two hours to fully enjoy all slides and rides. Important: Children below 3 years are not allowed inside Ski Dubai."

It is similar to the typical bunny/intermediate hill. The lift is slow and you can only get about 6 lifts per hour. The show is always perfect as the temperature is controlled and snow likely has preservative to keep in in perfect condition. I noticed that it is denser than light powder and does not fly up when you ski. I was more disappointed at the gear condition. My boots were in pretty bad shape and my skis had probably not been waxed since they were manufactured. As an experienced intermediate skier I felt unsafe on their equipment. They do provide the skis, poles, jacket and pants as you likely did not bring any of this gear when you came to Dubai. They do not provide hats or gloves, but of course they are available for purchase if you need them. I was able to withstand the cold temperature for about an hour before I called it a day."

Whilst the veteran ski holiday goers among you may find the slope options limited, this was a great introduction to powder skiing for an enthusiastic novice like myself.It is a perfect venue for those wanting to learn the basics. Lessons range from starter course to intermediate in 6 transitional levels. We took a 'level 2' lesson which assumed you knew the basics and focused on enhancing your stopping and turning ability with increasing degrees of difficulty. The tutors are very friendly and extremely capable and we were meandering seemlessly down the short practice slopes in no time. There were 2 practice slopes - one gentle slope of about 40m long and one steeper slope with slalom flags of about 30m long. We were able to progress through each and have one attempt at tackling the red run on the main slope which was a similar gradient to the 30m practice slope.Ski passes are available for the more experienced skiers which you can get for either a 2hr session or a full day. All in all a great day out with friends and a lot of fun. Would definitely return for a ski pass to conquer the bigger slopes next time I visit."

Once kitted up we met with our instructors for the session - who were fun and put us at ease. The session focussed on using putting on/taking off your skis, plus starting and stopping.Once inside the ski area - you can appreciate that Dubai has really replicated a true skiing environment with ski lifts, snow, ice etc., With 2 other people we practised and had the opportunity to use a small/gentle slope etc., We enjoyed the experience and would certainly like to return - if you are a learner the cost of lessons are expensive \u00a3100 for 121 or \u00a336 for a group lesson of 90 mins. You could join the ski school program if you are in Dubai for an extended stay. We also saw more experience skiers and snowboarders using the slopes - so the venue is not just for learners.Overall a fun day for all but not cheap. Plus allow plenty of time to get your kit before your session starts."

            "review": "Fun thing to do but the skiing is just play. If I would give points on this as a real ski-slope I would give it really lousy points but considering it is inside and in a country where it is very often 40\u00b0C and sometimes more then 50\u00b0C outside it is just a incredible project and a total out-of-the box idea to create something like this in UAE.I will list my thoughts on the various things at Ski Dubai. Most are good but there is some cons as well.General info.I just did the skiing, not the skids, slides and rides so I do not have anything to comment on that.The temperature was something like 4\u00b0C so it is not really cold for a Scandinavian like myself and I could easily spend the 4h skiing without using gloves or a hat but if you think it sounds cold I recomend you bring your own had and gloves. You can also buy them in the Ski Dubai sports shop to a exaggerated high price.If you have the possibility then try to avoid weekends, the place is small enough as it is.If you do not know how to ski, stay in the lower half.If you know how to ski, you will discovere that you are King of the hill - 95% of the other skiers are beginners, have not learned to stop or have not understood the skiing rules that whoever comes from behind has to give away for the people below them. Be careful.Checking in and payment:I dont remember exactly the price I paid but I think it was 200 dirham for 4 hours of skiing. This includes insulated skiing pants, jacket, slalom boots, poles and carving skis.On top of it it includes the time to ski offcourse.I was offered to take a course in skiing, I smiled at the Melanesian girl at the counter and told her I skied since I was 4 in which she thought I was a Pro, I told her no, I am a quality engineer and do not make my living of skiing. She had apparently not tried the skiing herself.She was however very good at determining the size of clothes, boots and skies I needed. Everything fit with the first set she gave me. Equipment:Clothes keep you warm enough. Skis is not top of the line but certainly good enough for this little ski slope where one can not accelerate to top speed before it is time to stop.The lifts:There are 2 lifts. The larger one is a chair lift in which your ride with others. It makes a bend in the middle portion of the ski slope to it is easy to get off on the middle if one requires. The only thing is that it is very very very slow. I never seen a ski lift this slow in all my life but perhaps it is because there is so many people who is so bad on skiing it looks like Bambi the deer on ice.The other lift runs on the side of the wall towards the mall. It is much faster but is very jerky at some points and if not used to skies it will throw you off as it requires you balance and concentration to ride.The ski slope:It is really really short and very very easy. I could make it from top to bottom doing slalom in about 13 seconds so it is really a ski slope for children. In the middle is a building for the turn of the chair lift. And below this building some jumps for the snowboards. Special surprise:As with many other muslim countries the ski slopes has become some kind of liberal free-zone. If you have noticed malls is a liberal free-zone where although forbidden people walk hand in hand, kiss etc etc. In the Ski Dubai it is not uncommon to be approached by local girls/women whereas this would rarely happen anywhere else.My recomendation is to try Ski Dubai just to say you tried to ski indoors and in Dubai. But if you are a real skier this is probably only something you want to do once."

Do remember to carry your own gloves and cap since it is not provided and it becomes uncomfortable inside without these. We were not aware of this and to buy it from the ski shop (20 Dhm for gloves, 55 Dhms for Cap).This place has a lot of fun filled activities inside but you need to purchase appropriate pass to experience them. There are 3 options - Snowpark entrance (basic one), Super pass and Power pass. I would recommend taking Power pass since most of the activities are fun.

This is a fad, you will most likely go do say you have been there! however its tiny compared to a real ski slope and the worst thing is the lift is incredibly slow! My biggest gripe is the speed of the lift, The ski run is about 500 meters so very good for an indoor slope, however you ski down it in 1 minute or less and they the chair lift takes 10 to 15 minutes to get you back to the top! My seven year old son kept asking why the lift was so slow! I can only think its so that if you ski down three or four times its taken you an hour! 4 mins skiing and 45 mins sitting on a chair lift! If you are planning on going take you own gloves with you as you cant rent gloves and you will end up buying some if you forget."

            "review": "Great attraction, shame about everything else. We booked online the day before, encountering problems with the online booking system. However after a few attempts it went through. We booked the penguin encounter and also after that a ski lesson.I received the online confirmation to my email almost straight away and in the email itself there was the bookings. In no part of the email does it say about that you need to be 45mins early ( this is very important information and should be included in the email itself not in an attachment).We arrived over 15 minutes early than the scheduled start time. The first counter we went to the guy asked us to go to a different counter as we needed the online booking counter. We went to the next counter and we was behind one lady who already had been waiting awhile and no one come. So then we went straight over the penguin counter again no one came to serve us or even noticed us waiting. We then approached someone whom very quickly jumped in saying you are late no refund can be given. I asked straight away to see a manager as the way she responded made me realize very quickly that this must be a common problem that the 45min notification isn't given in the email and also that they have a I don't care attitude. Another lady came out who then told me we had booked the wrong class for skiing. To any normal person a 'beginners' class is the first class for a beginner, but no in actual fact it turns out that its a discovery class that is the first class for a beginner- staff communicated back to us that they have reported this is a common issue that is misleading and gets them a lot of issue but still are not working to fix the common problem. The woman that then came to assist was not helpful at all, trying to just get rid of us and didn't want to give us a refund and tried to tell me that finance was not working so she could not give me a refund or tell me what percent they could give back, which is totally unacceptable. So at this point feeling very frustrated we demanded to speak to the Duty Manager who was very lovely and understood our situation and agreed that what happened with timings and also confusion over beginners classes is a very common issue and got us rebooked for the penguin and issued a full refund for the ski lesson. The penguin encounter was a great experience and the trainers was great. The introduction video did not work, but the instructor quickly then resolved the issue by talking about what would have been said in the video. The penguin encounter is good value for money and would recommend it to anyone. Also inside is amazing totally different to what you expect. My only observation was is there enough safety exits and clearly signed enough? Once coming out we wanted to look at our pictures, which was another bad experience: Majority of the staff were unhelpful and didn't focus on one guest, at this point I refused to buy a picture as the whole experience has not wanted me to give of my money to the company. But my friend did decide to buy one photo, it was very quick to print and straight away handed it to us in a bad not checking it was the correct one. I told my friend to check it and good job she did as it was the wrong photo.Its a big shame that it was such a bad experience from start to end as we are working in a hotel in Ajman and If it had of been a good experience and I had of done the ski lesson, if we had of enjoyed we would have come back time and time again on our time off and also recommend it to the guests are our hotel. Being manager's in a hotel we understand not everything is perfect but we really had bad luck with our experience which was a total shame as it is a great attraction"

The lighting is just great, creates an impression of winter evening - shine from snow. Artificial snow might create some disappointment for the kids as it doesn't make snow balls, but that's not a big deal. The only disadvantage - offered clothes is not enough to my opinion. Went there more than once and even with my own \"input\" in terms of socks, pants and jamper I got very cold after 1 hour, so I'd say for not too active runners this visit needs preparations - small bag with warm staff"

You can walk into the mall in shorts and a t-shirt and rent everything you need to go skiing for a couple of hours. I went on a Saturday morning at about 10 am, and there was hardly anyone at the place. Mainly because people are brunching off their hangovers from the night before. The experience is relatively cheap and something different to talk about at the lodge or the chairlift the next time you are out skiing or boarding with friends.

It is firm without being icy. As snowboarder this makes for easy turns. Especially given the standard of equipment. The board I was given had very little wax and dullish edges. It took a couple of requests before I got the size board that I was after. For me the runs are very short but it was great to get some turns in. However after about 40 mins I started to become board and called it quits after about 70 mins. It may have been more enjoyable if I was with a group of mates.There are other activities to do such as a zip line and zorbing. I did not try these.For someone who has not had a snow experience I can see how this would be a lot of fun. Would I do it again, I don't think so. But I am glad I did it."

This is one of those things to do before you die - ski in the desert; in a shopping mall! for the person who has never seen snow; it's a great way to check it out and feel the cold. there's many different activities rather than just ski. you can see a penguin show, have skiing lessons, Zorbing, etc. We only did the skiing for 2 hours and that was plenty. There's a painfully slow chair lift and a poma for the people who can ski. It takes a while to get to the top and not a great deal of time to hit the bottom - but it really is a bit of fun.My sons and I were really glad we gave it a go.The company is very professional with many counters and quick fit out time for boots, clothing and skis. A fraction of the time you spend on Alpine skiing. If you are a skier, I would suggest taking gloves to save buying some crappy ones as it is -4deg C inside. The hire clothing doesn't have pockets so stashing your phone or camera is difficult. For that reason I wish I had my own jacket, but it's not a hardship to whip back to your locker and re-stash."

The first indoor ski resort and park in the middle east , it is located in the best city in all time and if you guessed Dubai then your absolutely right. Ski Dubai is a faux snow park and is one of Dubai's famous attraction. With so many fun and entertaining rides you will never get bored. Beside just slides and sledging , they offer snow boarding lessons and ski lessons too. Enjoy winter all year round, experience real snow fun with penguins and snowmen just like Antarctica. All this endless enjoyment for the entire day in the snow park with only 140 Dhs for children and 150 Dhs for adults , not pricy for a snow park. There is also some bummer news, you would have to wait a long line especially when your in mall , it might be crowded sometimes depending on the season and you would have to buy your own gloves due to hygiene reasons which could be a great thing and a souvenir too. Everything will be provided , helmets , suit , boots and socks to stay warm and prepared for the frosty weather. It is located in the middle of the Emirates mall in Dubai , United Arab Emirates. Now that you read about this wonderful attraction wont you give it a try ? but if you ever do , make sure you wear something cozy because it is freeezing in there !"

I don't care how much they cost. After my first run down the frozen snowscape I was in throbbing pain. It had been years since my last skiing trip and this isn't snow. It's chipped ice so it feels a lot colder. My feet hurt so bad on the way down that I fell into the ice too many times. I got to the bottom and rushed to change my boots and buy gloves. My second run was much better. The trip up on the ski lift is serene and peaceful. You can either zone out and be one with the stunning scenery or laugh your $%# off watching people bumble their way down the hill. Moral of the story, don't rush it.

Wish they had told us that it was not working when we were paying for our passes. To stand in line everytime for the individual seats to drag you up was most inconvenient, and instead of doing about 20-30 runs in 2 hours, we managed only 10-12 runs and had sore wrists at the end of the day.

The staff at the Ski Dubai were friendly and informative and we opted for the Discovery lesson for 150 Dhirams (about 25 GBP) per person taht included warm clothing except gloves & hat (that's extra optionals), ski boots and skis for an hour's instruction. Pre-booking is recommended during busy holidays season. Changing areas are a bit chaotic but okay. We had a good instructor who taught us the ski basics and then guided us down the gentle slope. Some of us took to the ski without a fall and some fell everytime down a slope! All fun though. The place has much to offer if you are a skilled skier although it is all indoors. Just go for a lesson and you will not regret the experience. They teach little kids too as well as grown-ups."

You don't have to worry about ski clothing or equipment either. Ski Dubai has thought of it all and offers winter clothing, ski and snowboard equipment. Skis will carry you down the slope, and quad-chairlift and tow lift will promptly carry you back to the top for another run.Overall a total fun and what more you expect better than snow in the middle of Desert !!!Check - Price bit high for an individual, but if you are in a group its worth it.

The whole centre was well designed and filled with helpful staff. The entrance process is very simple and the lines aren't too long. Once you have paid for your desired entry fee you will get your equipment with ease. There are also lockers available for purchase for 40 Dirhams to store your unneeded gear. You can have a full meal at the St Moritz Restaurant in the entrance of the ski centre or have snacks in various stalls also in the ski centre entrance. I went to the ski slopes and the lines were short throughout the whole day. The snowpark seemed extremely packed throughout large portions of the day when compared to the ski slopes. The chair lifts are quite slow (5 minutes to the top) mainly for safety reasons as people have to get off at the midway point. The t-bar is far faster then the chair lifts (2.5 minutes to the top) but rather steep for amateurs. The snow is surprisingly powdery for an indoor centre and not icy at all. The slopes are snowboard and ski friendly and the staff are very exuberant. At the very top of the slope there are some flat rails and mini jumps as well as a big jump below the midway point that is opened for a short period in the evening for safety reasons. The midway slope is good for beginners who are past the point of carpet mats and the top slopes are for intermediates. Ski Dubai may not offer the largest slopes in the world but it is quite easy to improve your skills on over half a day or less and the whole place has a great atmosphere. I was blown away by how big the centre was considering it is firstly in a shopping mall and secondly in a desert. Whether you are a expert skier/snowboarder or a beginner I highly recommend trying Ski Dubai for a few hours and bringing your camera with you."

We hadn't really thought it through very well, so were forced to buy new ski gloves ( because we hadn't brought our own from home).It is a bit of a \"one size fits all\", so I would suggest that if you are a basic skier, you should take the lessons so that you have access to the bunny slope and revived a bit of guidance. My daughter, who has skied only once before (aged 9) was a bit spooked by the gradient of the part of the slope from the midway point.It is a great way to play in the snow and get a first taste of what skiing is like, but it is nothing like skiing under blue skies, with 50+ runs specific to ones ability.I would suggest the 200aed ticket that gives access to the toboggans, snow balls and perhaps the penguin experience instead of just the ski pass."

I booked the penguin experience and a visit to the Snow Park. The Snow Park was great (more on that later), but I personally thought that the penguin experience was a huge rip-off. First of all, make sure that you are at the park 45 minutes before your booked time to allow for getting your winter gear and changing. However, we were done in about 20 minutes which left us standing there and waiting. Secondly, they do not start on time, so that's about 10 more minutes of waiting. Thirdly, you book one hour experience, but it only lasts about 35 minutes, of which 5 minutes is a video of how to behave around the birds. Then as a group of 12 people, you are led to sit down and look at one penguin and take pictures with it. Then as a group you are led to sit down in another area and look at two penguins and then stroke them while photographer takes your pictures again. All in all, you look at the birds for about 15-20 minutes, and stroke them for about 1 minute. If you want pictures of the experience, you have to buy their photos. You are given snow jacket, pants, and boots, fleece gloves and thin socks, but no hats. This gear is too thin to keep you warm. I read online about Ski Dubai, and people recommend brining your own warm hats, winter gloves and thick socks, as sweaters and jeans - and this is a great advice!! After the penguin experience, we went to Snow Park and we had a great time. I would suggest buying the Super Pass upgrade because there are two attractions (the lift and the zorb ball) that are not included into the regular snow park pass. The snow park access is not timed, we were able to come out, get warmed up and eat at a cafe (by the way, be prepared that restaurant wait time to sit at a table was 50 minutes, and there was nothing but chips and salsa at a cafe to eat, all food is terribly overpriced). I would recommend getting some sandwiches and thermos with a hot drink and put them in a locker if you plan on only visiting the park and not staying at the mall for the rest of the day. You are allowed to come out for a little bit and then go back again. Slopes looked reasonably good, with several levels of difficulty, and a separate area for snowboard jumping. Will definitely go skiing next time we visit."

The prices are quite a rip off if you want to take the cable ride(costs around 200 AED per person) and they offer you free gloves which are nothing but fleece ones and don't withstand the cold.Nothing spectacular for the price you pay but the cable ride is good. You tell them your shoe size and they give you one size smaller mentioning our sizes are bigger whereas in reality they are not. We had to exchange our shoes twice. Would suggest to take your own caps and warm gloves if you intend to stay inside for more than 30 mins."

If this is you read on....if you thought that standing forever in queues full of strollers, small children and people generally just milling around was hard, wait until you turn up for your first lesson. When you walk through to the equipment area everything appears completely chaotic. Follow the signs on the wall i.e. queue for your clothing (jacket, pants and either ski or snowboard boots, they should give you socks too), get changed, dump your extra stuff in a locker if you decided to get one, then go get your skis/snowboard. The guys issuing these may ask some questions you can't answer yet, just tell them it's for a lesson and they'll sort you out. Then head on down to the back of the area to the ski school and wait for your instructor . A word on lessons, you'll need to take a discovery lesson if you've never tried the sport before. Then you move on to the beginner lesson. My instructor said that it's not uncommon to take a particular lesson a couple of times so don't plan on taking just one of each level. The lessons are pretty personalised with each person moving through the required skills as they master them. So as your lesson progresses you'll see people being shown how to do more advanced skills and others still practicing the basic ones. The idea is for you to feel happy with each skill. Your instructor will tell you at the end of the lesson if he thinks you could go on to the next level."

We were in a group of 12 and were provided with snow suits, boots, socks and gloves which were hot to stand around in whilst waiting for the tour to start. We also rented a locker as we were unable to bring our phones / camera etc when visiting the penguins. Once we were led into the ice, it was very exciting and the guide was lovely and knowledgeable.

But now you can ride a ski lift that goes around (for an additional fee of course), go in a giant ball plus you might catch the penguins if you're lucky (penguins are a different attraction all together so again additional fees).But I agree with some that say the price is not worth it. We only have the entertainer vouchers that's why we went in (Buy 1 Take 1), but otherwise we would have passed it up. Those who are just tourists in Dubai can check the web for anyone selling Ski Dubai vouchers. You can save a lot. Gloves and hat are not included in the price you pay. They will give you socks but it's so thin the cold will seep in through your boots. I suggest to bring additional socks and gloves and hat with you.

The whole internal area smelled strongly of diesel fumes, and when we mentioned this, one of the staff explained that they were building another ski run with chair lift. Machinery used during the night had polluted the air and we guess they had not vented the building. We were almost sick and felt very sorry for the poor staff who had to work the whole day in that stink.In addition. The clothes you are given are kept on a heap at the back of the equipment area. They are mostly in bad condition. My jacket arm was torn and couldn't hold the ski pass. The clothes smelt of sweat. After use everyone just dumps their jacket and trousers in a big bucket. Nothing is folded (or even cleaned after a days use...).On the inside of the building the paint looks old and stained especially around the cooling fans. The chair lift was being used by sight seers which caused a complete holdup for the people who had paid to ski. The snow is grey colour because they have not changed it in years. The ski boots are ropey to say the least.It high time that the management did a complete overhaul of this facility, and review their quality before expanding.I would advise anyone tempted to try this ski experience to skip it and go to the beach instead."

Upon arrival we made our way to the counter to purchase two day passes to the snow slopes and unfortunately this is where my devastation hit. The lady behind the counter asked if we had experience which my partner has however I didn't therefore was happy to take a first timers lesson to get me on my way. The lady proceeded to advise that not only did I need to complete a first timers course at 150AED I also needed to complete three other courses (make it to level two) before I could access the snow slopes. Although shocked at the requirements I was eager enough to get out there so I booked into the first timers class and off I went - our instructed Nina was fantastic and very patient with those in her group. Once we had finished I made my way to the counter to be told that there was no additional courses being held that day, therefore I could not access the snow slope at all. At this time my partner had already purchased his day pass and was out on the slope, so really the only option for beginners is to take lessons or entertain yourself in the snow park (great for kids, however I chose not to go with this option). It was highly disappointing that they had no beginners slopes which could be accessed for practise by those with any level of experience. I headed out for a day of shopping whilst my partner made the most of his snow slope pass. Later on in the day I attempted to book into the penguin encounter, to kill a bit of time the same lady as before advised that it was available however photos were not part of the package therefore I would have to ask the camera counter regarding the cost of these (you can't take your own camera in), when I returned to book the encounter it was fully booked up for another hour. By this point my attempts to enjoy what Ski Dubai had to offer had run out and I gave up on this experience. My recommendation would be to plan ahead if you want to access the snow slopes but have no experience, look at the lesson timing and book in advance to ensure you get to partake in what ski Dubai have to offer."

The penguin encounter is higly overrated where one could touch the penguin and click a picture with the penguin . While touching the penguin would be for few seconds , one has to pay minimum 200 AED for a picture .It is better to see the penguins from the snow park rather than pay extra for the penguin encounters.Ski Dubai is wonderful but very expensive . A full day pass is good when someone wants to ski but to experience the snow park and do the various rides . one does not need a full day pass. 3-4 hours in enough for visiting the snow park ."

Here in Dubai you can ski for a couple of hours or play on a snowboard, are the entire family, introduce them to skiing, check out if people enjoy the cold and snow... It is a good exercise, it is safer than real skiting as there are no rocks and trees. Sure it is artificial and not extensive, but heck, for two hours of ski experience it is perfect.Everything is supplied for you, and even during the 2 hours skiing you can go down and swap your board for some skis - like I did.

Whilst the concept of building an artificial ski slope in one of the hottest countries in the world doesn't exactly promote a sustainable energy strategy for the region, it is fun nevertheless.Be sure to dress up warmly. It is -3 degrees Celsius inside the ski hall. Ski gear, ski suits are provided butti is advisable to bring your own hat and gloves (or purchase them cheaply at nearby H&M). It is not cheap at 200 AED for 2h but with the Entertainer 2 for 1 voucher it is not too bad.Slope is good and accessible for beginners. I think experienced skiers might be a bit disappointed when they are used to skiing in the Alps but need to take it as an hour or two of fun in the mall.Cafe next door is very cosy and food is reasonably priced.

I could look out and see Virgin Records and other mall stores, as well as tourists pointing and taking photos. It was kind of fun to take photos of them taking photos of me!I bought a package with includes snow park + 2 hours of snowboarding. Spent about a half hour in the snow park trying out zorbing, snow tubing, and tobogganing. Then turned in my snow shoes for snowboard boots and went straight to the \"summit\".I like that all the jacket / pants / socks were included, and they were in good condition. My snowboard boots were brand new. The board was also decent, although not waxed enough.There's mini-park with a straight box, rainbow box, a small jump with a jib feature on top. 2 lifts, but they both start / stop in the same place. The chair lift is really slow and unfortunately, you can't get on it half way. The button lift appears to be faster, though it also looks tricky - bumpy and steep with a big curve in the middle (I didn't try it).The run from the top is a good intermediate run. Not powder, but not super icy either. They appear to have some good slopes for learning too.It was crazy packed during the weekend, when I was originally going to go. I changed my mind after I saw the crowd and decided to come on Monday morning instead, at opening time. I'm so glad I did. There was no line at all for anything. More people started to arrive as I left, but still nowhere near like the weekend. One of the workers told me that the line for the zorbing can be 3 hours long. Since I was the only one doing the zorbing, I did it twice in a row and both times, the guys working there were kind enough to take a bunch of photos of me inside and outside the ball.You might get pretty bored with the snowboarding if all you do is go up and down. If you're there alone, definitely bring some tunes for the SLOW lift ride. Since I don't do rails or boxes, I managed to amuse myself by practicing ground tricks like 180s and buttering. It's nice because there was virtually no one to avoid on the slopes, no nasty weather, and decent snow. Although I did hear that the snow quality worsens throughout the day. Another good reason to arrive at opening time, if you can manage that.By the way, I did happen to notice that there is a bar overlooking the ski slope that offers gluhwein. Would have been a nice way to cap off the experience, if I didn't have to catch my flight."

The chairlift was busy with non-skiers just taking a ride, but the attendants gave skiers and boarders priority so very little waiting. The slope itself was not crowded (far less busy than the indoor slopes in the UK). I enjoyed two hours on the slopes and it was good to ski for the first time in 2 years. The slope was well groomed. I have only two areas for improvement:(a) the chairlift moves really really slowly. It takes around 8 minutes to get to the top and less than a minute to ski down! If it could speed up a bit, it would be good, but I guess the pedestrians won't be able to get on and off.(b) Take your own gloves. I bought some for 70 dirhams from the shop but my finger tips were FROZEN after an hour so they were useless."

            "review": "It's Fun, But Busy!. My husband and I visited Ski Dubai for the first time recently and took a Discovery Level skiing lesson. We had a good time, though the area where our lesson took place was crowded (several group lessons running at the same time) so we each only had time for 4 runs down the small beginners' slope before they ushered us out. The instructors were helpful, though it was somewhat loud in there and hard to hear them. Neither of us had ever skied before but we were able to master the very basic skills they taught us, namely skiing down a very very small incline and successfully slowing down/stopping. I would have liked to have twice as many runs down the hill though, in order to make the price really worth it. When you book your lesson you are warned to arrive an hour early. We did and checked in, but didn't think we would need all that time to get our gear, so we reentered the mall and shopped for a few more minutes before coming back. It was so crowded, however, that it did take us at least 30 minutes to get our boots, ski clothes, and skis issued and all sorted out. So, if you are coming during a popular time, definitely give yourself 40+ minutes so you aren't stressed about missing your lesson. Our lesson was in the afternoon during the Eid holiday, so Ski Dubai (and the mall, and the entire city) were jam-packed. There were so many people milling around in the changing areas I felt claustrophobic--it would be nice if the facility was a little more orderly. Overall, yes it is a bit pricey for such a short lesson, but you can't beat the convenience of having all the clothes and gear issued to you and being able to walk right out and continue your shopping afterward. You ALSO can't beat the \"cool\" factor of being able to say you skied indoors. For someone who has been living in the Middle Eastern heat for a while, the chilly winter air in there was so refreshing! Bring a hat and gloves if you have them--we paid 20 dirhams extra each for gloves because we didn't have any. Also be prepared to pay extra for a locker to store your stuff. We enjoyed our experience--minus the crazy crowds in the entrance area--and can see ourselves going back again."

My partner & I had a great time, we board at home and had been away all winter so were getting our fix! I would only recommend paying for 1 hour of boarding/skiing if you are only going to use the slops and not the jumps or park. There is also other things to do in there but they charge extra for everything!! Take Gloves as they DO NOT include them in any hire prices, and you will have to purchase new gloves. There are a cheap option for gloves but they are not water proof for long, especially if your hand touches the snow for any period of time!Real good fun though!!"

I had a couple of hours before my Airport pick-up and thought this would be fun, being an OK skier (not very regular), and having used indoor slopes in the UK before I knew what to expect. The slope itself is good and given that it's inside is bigger than I expected. The 'expert' short run isnt really expert, you might consider it a difficult european 'blue' rather than a 'red', but it's nice to have a variation on runs. The staff were great, very helpful and polite and the hire desks very efficient so not a lot of hanging around to collect gear etc.The Skis I had were terrible, no edge at all and very battered, which was a shame - I guess I could have swapped them but that meant trudging all the way back to the desk. That said, they were good enough to be fun for the 2 hour session.The clothing that's included is OK and warn enough - but there are no pockets (that I could find) in either the trousers or the jacket (except one very small one on the arm to keep your pass in) - so I couldn't take my camera or wallet in with me, which was a shame, however the locker facilities are fine and secure.Travelling up the button lift though you notice how dirty the walls are, and there are cracked windows on the TGI Friday's that overlooks the slope, also you see a lot of water staining and just general grubby marks - of course this dosent impact your enjoyment of the slope, but it just seemed a shame when so much money had gone into creating a ski-slope in the middle of the desert!I had a really good time, 2 hours is plenty long enough before you get bored of spending as much time on the lifts as you do coming down - but thats the same in some outdoor resorts.All in-all a good way to spend a couple of hours at reasonable value for money, and overall I enjoyed my time there."

The electronic ticketing system is great and tells you each time you go through the gate how long you have left of your 2 hour pass. Make sure you rug up. The ski suit you are given is not particularly warm and the slope is not long enough to get a sweat or the heart rate up, so rug up to avoid the cold setting in.If you are looking for a fun experience (quite surreal when you think about it) I would certainly recommend you try Ski Dubai for a few hours of entertainment."

It felt like real snow. They do a good job of keeping the atmosphere as close to ideal ad possible. You should definitely go. It's amazing what a lot of money will build."

I grew up skiing on Northeast ice and migrated to the good stuff out west. Ski Dubai seemed way too gimmicky in person. But I knew I'd second guess myself if I walked away, and I'm glad I tried it. Gimmicky - for sure if you are skier. But for locals, it offers a unique experience. And I'll say this: I never waited a moment in the lift line (skip the chair, it's too slow) and the snow conditions were far superior to many of my eastern trips. They give you everything but gloves and a hat (didn't need the latter)."

The explanations are rather short and the so called interaction limits it self to a few pictures from the photographer (no own cameras allowed). The suits are also very old and partly broken. My son did feel very cold in them. With the entrance ticket you are not even allowed to go in the snow play area afterwards. The best thing came afterwards when we found out that you can buy the pictures for 20+ Euros a piece,... that is simple extortion!!!

I came here with a good ski buddy from Colorado and we were just cracking up. It was pretty surreal to see women in bhurkas riding the ski lift, then seeing the TGI Friday's next door. We didn't have much time but the staff was very speedy and brought us to the front of the line to get equipment. For a couple of hours lift ticket and rental (skis, boots, and all clothes minus gloves - bhhr) it was about $60. If you're in Dubai I'd say definitely check it out! We were on the more difficult slope, which was actually more difficult than I had anticipated. That being said, going fast we could cruise down the whole slope in about one minute, so it was kind of like skiing in the midwest. The main ski lift is really slow (since the whole place is full of beginners). There is a poma lift that is a bit ball busting but gets you up the slope quicker. If we had more time we would have paid to get our pictures taken with penguins. This is located inside the Mall of the Emirates, which is a piece of cake to get to from the airport by taking the metro."

Boots, jackets, gloves etc. are all given to you which is great and expected anyway. Kids below 4 have to buy their own gloves at a store next door. Very importantly, make sure you take your own pictures. The folks with cameras just make you do a silly dance and stretch your arms like kooky tourists and you never know how those pics will come out. Besides they charge you an arm and a leg for the picture. So if you want a memory of Ski Dubai, get someone to take a picture of you with your camera. It's awfully cold so your camera will cool off and shut down or maybe I'm using a real old Canon. The ski lift is stupendous. Enjoyed the rides etc. but didn't really snowboard etc. because I don't know how to. You can choose to get the (more expensive) all day pass which allows you to get out, grab a bite and come back in. But honestly, if you start early, you'll pretty much have enough of the cold in a few hours. In all, it was a great experience."

The experience was very nice, we got to meet two types of penguins and stroke, pet, hug and kiss the King Penguins! This was a very unique experience, but there were two things to be aware of:Firstly, no cameras were allowed, so you had to buy the internal taken ones, these were almost prohibitively expensive but you do feel you need a memento of your trip!Secondly, though educational, the exhibit doesn't seem to serve a conservation point, there was no real explanation why the penguins were there, so it must be presumed just for tourists! Whilst this is a reason and the penguins appeared well looked after it didn't sit emotionally as well as it would if the clear educational purpose was spelt out!"

Rarely can I see such a dedicated love like this. It ensured me that the penguins here are well-loved and taken care of since I didn't want my fee to contribute to any greedy organization who only want revenue and money but not the well-being of these cute animals.My standard Peng-friend section is about 150 AED and 30 AED for the locker, but you get all of the clothes and gloves (you can keep the gloves later). First I was guided through a tunnel with educational video of penguin, then arrived at the meeting point, where I were officially encountered these lovely friends. You will see a series of king & gentoo penguin enjoy their underwater swimming. Then had the gentoo penguin run over you and sit right next to you... Well, that's totally unexpected.After the meet up, I was escorted to meet two big King Penguin, and have chance to personal touch and give them a hug from the back - really amazing experience as their fur is so soft and warm.Another highlight is that our photographer was really good at taking pictures, all of my pics were so beautiful that I had to have them all.

OK, it's not like the alps or Colorado, but the novelty of skiing in Dubai (about 50C when were there) appealed to the skiiers in us.I was impressed by the size of the slope and the condition of the snow, it felt like genuine good alpine snow. This is probably achieved by the extreme cold in there. Whilst they give you ski-jackets and trousers to wear, they're laughably thin and I'd advise anyone going to take a jumper along too. We booked two hours, but all of us had enough of the cold after 90 minutes.We also did the 'meet the Penguins' thing. My son's a huge Penguin fan and it was a (they say) unique experience to actually touch the Penguins. I'm not sure how 'natural' that is, but it was an experience and the environment for the penguins did look as good as (or better than) I've seen in any zoo. The staff seemed genuinely concerned for the animals welfare too (and they looked healthy), so I didn't feel too guilty about this experience.Overall, the trip to Ski Dubai was one of the highlights of our stay in Dubai."

They have a chairlift but it is slow so take the t-bar right next to it to get up faster and get more runs in. I did skiing while the family enjoyed the snow fun park. It is one of those things that you have to do when you are here. If you have your own kit, just bring your own gloves and socks (maybe hat if your ears get cold)-all the rest they will give you and it works for what it is. Don't expect top notch rentals-my skis stuck when getting up to speed-but they worked great to play around for the 2 hours. I would do it again the next time I am in Dubai"

Ski Lessons are a minimum of 4 lessons in Discovery before allowing you to move to the slopes. But just hanging about in the snow is good. Very cold if you are standing around and not moving much. Take advantage of the unlimited entry as you can go in and out as much as you please. Upgrade gloves as the complimentary ones are only fleecy and they get wet. For 2 adults plus 2 kids $300 AUD plus. But where else will you get snow indoors and it's 40plus outdoors. Snow blaster was fun!"

So you may find my review a bit biased, since it was my 1st time experience of this kind.We went there on a Saturday morning and it was quite packed with locals as well as tourists.Our ticket included entry to the snow park, a free pair of gloves, a free hot chocolate and a basic training to ski.You need to get your jackets in the counter before entering the park.Once you enter the 1st impression is a WOW. Come'on guys u r in Dubai and you have just entered a big big snow park - It 's just Amazing.The snow park as a whole was good with slopes to slide, giant balls to roll and a rope way ride.Now we come out again to join the ski program. This part starts with getting the appropriate pair of ski for you. It itself is an experience. Once inside the training zone the trainer gives you some basic movements on how to ski and then he leads you to a slope and helps individually to ski the slope. We fell, we rise (it was quite a challenge to stand again with the ski on your feet), we learn, we enjoyed. I had some of the most cherished memories with my friends here. It's, in fact one of my BEST experience in Dubai. You will see just kids of age 4 to 6 skiing quite difficult slopes here. But please don't be ashamed to join the course. You will quite enjoy it and moreover we have seen peoples of age 60-65 also joining the training program. So just learn from them on how to continue learning.P.S : The gloves and hot chocolate provided are not best but who cares."

When on the slopes they provide everything for you except gloves which cost about 12 AU dollars. I would recommend to wear a jumper and tracksuit pants underneath the snow suit. If you go to Ski Dubai you should definitely go on a school day. When I went there would have been about 30 people on the slopes. The staff were very understanding. I left my gloves back in the main room and when I entered the slopes a very kind staff member gave me his gloves. Also the chair lift stalled for about 15 minutes and we asked the manager if we could have our time again because my brother was stuck on the lift and he agreed. Overall very friendly and fun, great Dubai experience."

The slope is served by a central high capacity chair lift and an old style Poma lift on the inside curve. You don't need to bring anything to have a great time; everything is provided. (Skis, boots, poles, jacket and snow pants) I do suggest buying a pair of gloves and something to keep the ears warm. The climate control is still set to \"beautiful winter day\". The slopes offer challenges for all levels; lessons for the \"never ever\" and big jump ramps with and without airbags for the truly daring. The facility offers sledding and skating activities also.

I had some initial reservations - is it ethical, etc? - but the penguins (gentoo and king penguin species) are all third generation captive bred and all came from a sea world in Texas. So they have not been taken from the wild and would in all likelihood not survive there.It is true that they are learning unnatural behaviours (chasing skittles, posing for photos, allowing humans to touch and even kiss them), so if you are concerned about this I would give it a miss. All penguins seemed very healthy and happy (at least to my inexpert eye). They are certainly extremely cute and the carers gave very good instructions about what (human) behaviour was acceptable before we encountered the penguins.No photos are allowed inside and they hit you up for what I thought were very overpriced photos on the way out."

The professionals can experience different levels of skiing fun by having competitive races with loved one.

Rides, skiing, behind the scenes with the penguin trainer and shopping in the mall after... what's not to love??We visited Ski Dubai in June (hot hot HOT Summer!) which provided a wonderful reprieve from the weather outside. My 6-year old went for her first ski lesson and I regret not having enrolled myself as well. I saw many adults (including some who must have been in their 70's) at the Discovery and Basic classes as well, as well as a tiny tot on the intermediate slope. For those who prefer other activities, there is a giant \"snowball\" in which to roll down the slope, toboggan rides (fast and slow depending on age and preference) and meet-and-greet with the penguins! Or, as in our case, a behind the scenes visit with one of the penguin trainers to see the King & Gentoo penguins in their home. Amongst other things, we watched a couple of male Gentoos stealing pebbles from one of the nests to build their own, and then later watched the original \"owner\"of the pebbles steal them back. Since it was situated in the Emirates Mall, there was plenty to eat and buy before/after visiting Ski Dubai. All in all, a wonderful experience :) "

We didn't buy the regular site-seeing package of Dubai, but had planned an itinerary for ourselves with 1 exciting sport each day!We reached the Mall of Emirates early & bought a special deal from their ticket counter which included Ski lessons for all 4 of us, along with the snow park activities, the Penguin show & free fleece gloves as well! Its better to reach early to avoid crowds.We were issued insulated clothing, woolen socks & very heavy ski boots according to our shoe size. One has to get skis according to the size of these shoes provided. Then keep all your belongings & shoes into a locker. One should definitely use the rest room before getting in all the layers of clothing. All of this takes quite some time. Then you all gather at a specified location to meet your guide (in case you are taking a skiing lesson). The guide escorts the group in. We were 6 adults in a group & the kids had a separate guide. Once inside, you feel a sudden drop in temperature. Just keep following the guide's instructions & soon you'll be skiing down the learner slope. Our kids picked up the sport very fast. It was us adults who kept falling very often. Once skiing is done, you need to return the skiing shoes & ski, and regular rubber snow boots are issued to you. Use rest rooms again now...You return again to the snow & enjoy the activities like the sledge ride, snow tube ride, zorbing, chair-lift ride and take snaps. After that you can enjoy the Penguin show. Please note that there are specific timings of the Penguin show, about 2 hrs apart. Do inquire about them when you re-enter for snow fun, else you may miss out on the show.Overall, a fantastic day! A not-to-be-missed activity when at Dubai!"

Its somewhat confusing to work out what package to buy as you are not allowed on the ski slope unless you are a competent skier/snowboarder or take a lesson. The day I went the beginner lesson was booked out so I would advise booking ahead of time. I still decided to go in and found that there were heaps of fun activities for non skiers many of which were included in the basic entrance pass and some that you either had to pay extra or were part of a super pass. All the gear was part of the pass to but I would suggest taking an extra long sleeve for under the snow jacket because its still quite cold. The signage to many of the rides was poor but I think they are refurbishing. Overall I had an awesome few hours at ski Dubai."

You need to buy gloves (get the good ones if you will be there for a while - 70 UAE) and Beanie (30 UAE). The website / ticket said you will be tested with your ski ability before getting on the slope - no one checked us out so on we skiied. The chairlift is in the centre with a 'get off' point half way up or you go to the top. Against the wall is a draglift / T-Bar for experienced skiers. Much quicker than the chairlift but there are some really short steep areas. The best time to go in on weekdays and as soon as it opens. I had the runs to myself for nearly 2 hours. The hot chocolate is awesome and a best way to warm up. Avoid the 2 hour ticket - by the time you are enjoying yourself, the time is up. A day tickets is best option. It can get cold so wear minimum two or three t-shirts underneath your jacket. Bring thick socks as well to get the best comfort for the hire boots."

And my mother enjoyed the ski chair lift which gives a view of the skiing going on below us. Pros: lots of fun for small kids.cons: bit expensive if you're on a budget.Tip: Although the ordinary ticket includes entry and warm outer clothing, (excluding helmet and gloves) there are special packages that include the chair lift, fleece gloves, hot chocolate and giant ball ride that seem like a bargain... DONT fall for it... the hot chocolate in the package is outside the snow park and is not exchangeable with any other drink, the giant snow ball ride is something many small kids refuse to do, and if you go in and find that they want these things, you can easily upgrade to a higher package inside !"

Took two grandkids, 12 and 13, for several hours beginning at about 8 pm to almost 12, they never tired but did get numb feet and fingers after a while. The price, in my opinion, is very reasonable for the basics including pants, jacket, boots and even a pair of socks (unused and in a wrapper). Although some activities are not included in the basic prices, upgrades are available and many choices too. Only downside for me was the exorbitant prices of the photos, the agents start offering the highest prices, then after some negotiating the deals are revealed. Not to my liking at all and no prices are posted, so the bargaining skills must be implemented to get a fair shake! Gave me a chance to wander the Mall of Emirates, have a coffee at the St. Moritz cafe with its charming but fake fireplace! Then this grandmother went in the Ski Dome for some fun in the cold! I do believe we will go again in July!"

As well as skiing and snowboarding you could get different passes to go in the play area and zorbing ball, all very cool. We did wear leggings and a long sleeve t-shirt under the clothes provided but I would advise to wear more as we got cold quickly as its -2 but seemed strange to take jumpers to Dubai.

We head heard about the indoor ski park in Dubai and I remained quite skeptical about how well it would perform being much to small to get any real skiing. How wrong I was! We ventured to the Mall of the Emirates and had a good look around before deciding to try it. We had taken our own gloves and beanie, but everything else was supplied with the entry fee - skis, boots and suit. We paid for a two hour stint on the ski slope and after kitting up, we entered the slope. As you enter, the time starts automatically by reading the plastic card which you have inserted into the sleeve of your jacket. This is a great system, for every time you enter the chairlift, your access is permitted by the card and when your time is up, it simply tells you, so no clock watching.The temperature inside is -5C and the slope is groomed every night. The snow is dry and crisp and easy to ski upon. I marveled at the size of the slope which cannot really be seen until you enter the slope itself. Although I hadn't skied for 15 years, within a couple of runs it all came back and we all thoroughly enjoyed our time, which went all too quickly. I thought it good value, being efficient and fun. Snow skiing in the desert ... well I never!!!"

Four one hour lessons are required for novices - we were unaware of this before we went.Novices get access to the small tobogganing track and the tube slide for a basic pass. That's pretty much it. For an upgrade within the centre (more to pay) you can use the ski lift, long toboggan, etc.For just the basic pass like we opted for, 2 hours is enough, you've done it all. We went on a fairly quiet day and were stopped at least a dozen times by Ski Dubai photographers for photos which became annoying.Still good to go but if you've played with snow elsewhere, wouldn't rush to get there as Dubai has some fantastic other options for kids. Shopping centre around it was pretty good and can have a look at Ski Dubai through the glass windows.If you buy \"The Entertainer\" there is a 2 for 1 pass in it. This book was worthwhile buying for the all the attractions in Dubai (available from bookshops in the shopping centres)."

It was the highlight of our two full days stay in Dubai.Some research is needed to determine which ticket you want to buy as there are many possibilities and making the decision while people are waiting is not the best. I saw a few take VIP level tickets costing about US$240 and not really knowing what the alternatives were. As we did not really want to ski or take skiing lessons, we had to decide between a Super Pass (about US$87) and a Power Pass (US$58) where the Super Pass includes an interaction with the penguins.We had a hard time with the portion the followed buying the tickets which is getting the right-size attire. With the crowd being very light, it still took us a good 30 minutes and my son still went back to get a smaller size. One thing to note is the boot sizes are at least three sizes bigger than normal. In other words, if you shoe size is US 45 (UK 10), make sure you try 41 or 42 before you leave to the changing area. If not, you might end up standing in line again or having an argument with another customer if you skip the line.Putting on the attire was somewhat of a struggle with two kids, but we managed though I was feeling hot inside out by the time we were done. One thing to remember is to keep the entry cards(or tickets) outside either in your hands, in the very small pocket in the left arm of the jacket. It might in fact be a good idea to carry a small cross body bag with you.Once inside, all the waiting, the heat and whatever were forgotten. We starting shooting photos with the kids from the entry and did not want to stop. It was not about snow only, but the design of the place provides for many photo opportunities. More than that the activities offered are all wonderful and exciting. Even though we did not ski, we took the ride up to the top and saw some skiers, young and old, doing some interesting moves and truly enjoying themselves.Though the final part of our visit, interacting with the penguins, was less than I expected, it was still exhilarating for the boys. They keep taking about it and chose to have their photos with the king penguin printed more than the other photos.We spent almost three and a half hours from beginning to end and another hour choosing the photos (we lost the reference numbers as we did not have a place to hold them). We also had to wait another half hour for the photo package to be prepared which we spent at a restaurant having a meal and resting. We will definitely remember this experience fondly for many years to come."

This advice is more for people with kids as they get very excited and want to touch the snow. Otherwise this place is great for both adults and kids."

You can even sit at the window which is beside the part of the ski slope where the ball ride is located. This makes for an exciting meal, as the balls head straight for the window.

For 200 AED with coupon, you get the full rental gear plus a two hour lift pass. Two hours was the perfect amount of time to have an enjoyable day. The facility surprised me with a rail section that had three rails/boxes to hit (two side by side ones followed by a final one) giving a decent option for your run. There were also two nice jumps set up on the bottom portion of the hill, but they were not open when I was there. We went on a Thursday afternoon and the place was nearly empty. No lines for the chairlift and even less for the t-bar (which if you can bear it, gets you about double the amount of runs as the chair due to speed). We did not buy or rent hats or gloves, but a thin pair of gloves would be recommended if you are doing any sort of stuff that could end up with yourself on the snow. Speaking of snow, that was the only slight downfall to the facility as the boards did not seem to be waxed and carving through the snow sometimes would slow you down noticeably. If you have some time in Dubai and a few extra bucks, I'd definitely recommend this attraction."

Fantastic that you can get this experience in the desert.A tip though is to be there almost 1 hour before your booking as that is how long it takes to work your way through the crowds, and the process of getting your tickets, getting your gear, putting it on, getting your clothes in the lockers. We missed our slot and had to wait a whole hour in our gear fr the next slot, which fortunately was not booked out. The hassle of getting ready is the only downside as the ticket/dressing area is as busy as a railway station. Other than that a great experience and worth the trek. Even experienced skiers get a kick with a visit."

Probably the only place that would be snowing!!! Warning! For Europeans used to natural snow clad peaks, this may not be that great an attraction. However, for people who are from the hotter climes such as Asia, this is definitely a place to be. Or you may want to visit it just to marvel at the way an entire snow park has been created right in a desert country, and even more so, right in the middle of a mall!!!Would suggest taking the entire package which costs around AED 200 per head if you want to enjoy all the activities on offer. This includes the zorb ball and slides. You can also watch the penguins being fed if you are lucky to visit around their lunchtime. There is a separate package that allows you to feed the penguins, though that is a bit expensive. For people travelling with kids, this is an extremely kid friendly place. The kids can freely run about while you have your little ME time. The place is extremely safe and manned by very helpful staff.You also have access to lockers to keep all your stuff. And if you get hungry after all this activity, remember that you are inside the Mall of the Emirates! Plenty of food options are available."

My sister and I have both been skiing since we were very young children, and of course the slope hardly competes with the real deal, but it's still great fun and somewhat of a novelty to ski in a shopping centre in the Middle East! My boyfriend is not a skier but enjoyed his discovery lesson there too. This trip we decided to try the Penguin Encounter, which costs around \u00a330 per person. You get to 'meet' a couple of penguins, stroke one and give it a hug, which was fantastic! Be warned that no cameras are allowed and that their photos cost 100 dirhams (around \u00a318) each, which is a bit of a sting! The snow park also looks great for the little ones, although I have not visited it myself. Everyone should visit this place whilst in Dubai, a definite must! Tip: This year's Entertainer book has vouchers for BOGOF on skiing and the snow park (I think) although not for the Penguin Encounter, so might be worth getting one if you are planning on doing lots of activities and eating out a lot in Dubai"

An odd and surreal experience in Dubai but absolutely FUN!!!!!When planning a visit to Dubai, Snowboarding in the desert seemed like a fun novelty idea that would be disappointingly small proved otherwise! Though small, the concept of snowboarding in the desert overwhelmingly drew out smiles! Included in the price of the lift tickets were clothing, equipment and hours of fun. Please note, gloves and helmets are an extra charge but those with experience will not find these items absolutely necessary. There is basically one small run that takes about 7 minutes up the lift but watching beginners and spectators was quite entertaining. Those with experience will enjoy the terrain park that will allow you to jump a car!!!!Great fun, good value for under $60USD which is much cheaper that actually skiing or snowboarding a real mountain."

Something different to try when your out in Dubai, I've never been skiing or snowboarding before so it was quite an unusual feel to be outside in the blazing sun one minute then going into the cold facility to ski... but i'm glad i did.It was recommend to us to do lessons if we'd never snowboarded before however me and my cousin was feeling quite rebellious (not recommended) and just decided to take to the snow and teach our self's!! It took me about 30 mins to get the hang of it and started hitting the decided to hit the slopes, i had a lot of falls and tumbles but it was all learning in practice.I think the whole thing lasted about 1hr30mins/2hrs all together, it can be very tiring so make sure you've eaten something small before hand. I have to say it was extremely fun, i had a good time with my cousin who lives out there and it made me feel like i would possibly do a ski resort holiday.There is a great view from inside the largest mall in the world the Dubai Mall of Emirates(MOE) looking into SkiDubai and an even more awesome view from inside the Kempinski Hotel where you can see inside Ski Dubai from your hotel room,i imagine that to be quite kool and expensive!! I am back to Dubai in June2013 and i will definitely be coming back here hopefully as a professional!!!!lol ;-) p.s ...its real SNOW!!!"

The emphasis is all around pics with the penguins and you will get a hard sell and the pics are incredibly expensive, given they are pretty unique you may find it difficult to say no so be aware beforehand.The groups taken in are up to around 12 a time and you get split in to twos or threes for the pics.Unique experience although incredibly expensive !!"

Once you get inside, there is room to wander and experience the \"cold\", with a bobsled slide, and a tube-run, plus the Zorb ball run. The SuperPass also let's you ride the chairlift to the top, but my daughter was under the minimum height restriction (about 140cm, if I recall).My daughter has never experienced really cold weather or snow before, so she absolutely loved it!

Also helpful hint, don\u2019t put on your boots as you will have to take them off to get your skies sized!After you have your skies you will grab your poles and head upstairs where you can get on the lifts. You can either get off half way up (near the \u201clodge\u201d) or take the chairlift to the top where you can either go right or left (so essentially two trails).Tips: Don\u2019t put on your boots as you will have to take them off to get your skies sized.

The guy who regulates the skis asked very seriously my level of ski to make sure the bindings were OK. Once you are in you feel hot because of the clothes but over the 2 hours you feel pretty cold. There is one quadruple chairlift that is very slow and reduces speed all the time because apparently local people like riding the lift as if in an amusement park. The ski lift is faster but has 2 very steep passages. The snow felt a bit wet in the beginning, but once you are used to it it is ok. Temperature was -4C. One part of the slope is like a european red track, there is a small jump on the way. I had a lot of fun, specially considering that this is in the middle of the desert. Don't forget to bring your hat and gloves, the rest is included in the fee. I highly recommend this attraction for skiers of all levels."

A friend of mine worked on the construction of this surreal but iconic Dubai attraction. 2 hours worth of skiing on pretty simple slopes with shoppers in tee shirts and shorts watching from behind glass walls. If you're and avid skier you'll likely be bored after 4 or 5 runs. For novices ans those with families it's pretty cool. We went mod week so we pretty much had the chair lifts and slopes to our selves. Considering you get the clothes and ski gear thrown in to the 2 hour deal it's not a bad deal and there's plenty of lower slope snow fun and a penguin encounter to be had for the younger kids and/or non-skiers. It was colder than we were expecting so if you are prone to the cold, take some of your own layers and decent gloves. We warmed up at about the 60min mark in the cafe hand way up the slopes with a hot chocolate. We the had late lunch on the ground floor outside looking in at TGIF's.

There is nothing like skiing in a powdery snow resort such as Utah, Colorado, Washington, NY in US."

A day pass is for around 60 Euro quite okay, if you consider that it is in the UAE. Through the week you dont have to wait long, so its really worth it. You get free helmets, which allows you to use the Fun Park (boxes, rails and a table topper). From time to time there are two small kicker open, table is around 1,5 and 2-3 meter. Clothing is included but no gloves and hats. The socks are free of charge also included. As it is directly connected with the mall (where a carre-four) is available) its easy to get cheap food beside this a lot of restaurants are available. Even for me who grow up in the alps it was a nice experience, its not a must do thing, but its worth it."

It was great fun, visit their website and see what they have on offer. I had a great time learning how to snow board for the first time. Everything was provided, boots, board and clothing. You won't be supplied beanies or gloves, but can purchase them at the store while you are there if you want them. You do need to line up to get the boots and clothing, so get there a little ahead of schedule to ensure you don't miss the starting time if you are taking a lesson. My only regret was believing that the soft, fluffy snow was indeed that...I fell on my butt and the snow was like concrete...two days later my butt is still sore...try to soften your fall if possible!"

It isn't a waste of time or money it really is a good day out, suggest the 2hour package for your first trip there even if you are a keen skier as the slopes are hardly challenging but there is more than enough to keep interest for a short session.We did 2x 2hrs so 4hrs in total but that is not for the faint hearted if you want to get your moneys worth. One annoyance was that in between our two hours sessions we left our poles with an instructor at the bottom by the entry point who assured us that she would look after them, of course we came back and they were gone so we had to waste our skiing time queueing up to get another set of replacements.Overall though, it appeared well run and we had a good day there and will definitely go back a few times each year to keep in practice for the main season in Europe.

Came here during a business trip and decided to do it because I hadn't been able to ski back home (Colorado) for the past 2 years, and figured it'd be cool to do it in Dubai. For the record, I typically ski intermediate and difficult (blues and black diamonds) terrain in most of Colorado's ski resorts.Liked: Scratched my itch for carving some powder (surprisingly decent powder)! Runs were steep enough to provide some practice on my turns. Great package deal that included a jacket (didn't think I'd actually need it, but did), snow pants (I turned this down), skis/thin boot socks/boots/poles, and the \"lift ticket\" (doubles as a storage locker key for a few extra bucks). I brought my own hat and gloves, but only wore the gloves and was fine; not sure if hat/gloves come with the package, didn't look like it but there is a small winter clothing store with name brand stuff if you really have the money to spend. Also, a few other activities for non-skiers that looked worth checking out. Didn't do any though, just wanted to ski!Dislikes: SLOW chairlift. Took much longer to go up the chairlift than to go down the run. They have a \"T-bar\" type lift that was labeled for experts only, but it was the fastest way up the slope. I've never ridden a \"T-bar\" and had no issues figuring it out.Interesting note: They actually built a little \"lodge\" half way up for a hot beverage/snack stop. Interesting.Final Notes: Relative to the fact that it's a man-made, indoor ski slope (in Dubai, no less), it does the job for getting some runs in. They have a bunny hill off to the side for learners, but as an average skier, I was pleased with Ski Dubai; just would've been nice if the lift was quicker since the runs are short."

However, having experience of other indoor slopes in the UK, and of 'real snow', I have to say that I'm really impressed with Ski Dubai. The prices aren't bad; about \u00a330 for a 2 hour pass, but that includes all your equipment (apart from gloves). The equipment is getting a little on the 'tired' side, and is probably due for replacement, but certainly is not bad.The slopes themselves are great; there's a central chair-lift which can drop you at the half-way stage of the slope, or you can stay on to go to the top. There's also a button-lift to take you directly to the top (with some massive inclines!!).The two times I've been so far, it's been at about 20:00 in the evening, and you pretty much have the whole slope to yourself. There are plenty of other people around inside, but they are there mostly for the snow 'experience', rather than skiing or snowboarding.The slopes are good; certainly not without bumps and ruts, and steeper sections, but the biggest issue is dodging people queuing for the toboggan run if you choose to go from the top, and not down the black run.The time from base to top on the chair lift and back down is about 10 mins (fairly slow chair), so your two hours flies past.If you're in Dubai, pay this place a visit - its a great way to spend a couple of hours (but don't forget your gloves!!)"

The snow was good quality and so was the equipment. Note you will need gloves which are available to purchase. All other equipment and clothing is provided down to the disposable socks. Cafe on the hill is reasonable for a hot chocolate. We opted for the 2 hour session which was more than adequate as no queues for the lift. The only negative would be that there were skiers allowed on the main hill who had not skied before and were some what of a liability to themselves and others. Therefore more stringent vetting would be recommended."

It is great for:-beginners (level snow, free from bumps). -intermediates, who wish to warm up or refresh their skills before hitting the slopes in Europe or elsewhere.-experts (for practicing tricks, boxes, rails, jumps etc). (Last Thursday of every month, experts can practice their jumps/flips and land in an airfilled cushion!). In fact this resembles more like a snow park.-people who are tired of shopping, but have to accompany family members who do!-are bored of treadmills, but need to exercise.It is NOT for:-long cruising runs (I am intermediate skiier and at full speed without slalom, it takes me about 30 seconds from top to bottom)-enjoying views (as it is entirely indoors)Overall, I would recommend it if your purpose is one of the items I listed above, as thats whats its great for. It has REAL snow, temperatures are about -4 degrees celcius, so its cool but not to cold. Great for summer!"

OK, maybe it was kind of silly for a Canadian like me, who worked in arctic, to pay money to walk around in the snow, but there you go.

Having lived all my childhood in the sweltering climate of Abu dhabi (just 2 hours drive down south from dubai), it was quite amusing to have a skiing holiday experience at Ski Dubai, which dad had arranged as a surprise for me and my brother. On a hot Saturday afternoon, we reached Mall of the Emirates & walked down to the basement floor to get to the entrance of ski dubai. It was an on-the-spot booking and thankfully, did not require any prior preparations. You'll get all the necessary ski clothing, gloves, boots & equipment for having a great cool day. Or you can buy extra stuff at the retail shop SnoPro. So, we entered indoors - it was as big as 3 football fields, covered with snow at -1 to -2 degrees which was poles apart from the hot climate outside. We took lots of pictures (ya, it's ok to take in your camera and phones,but keep them safe; my watch stopped working after 3 hours). There was a penguin show at 4 pm. Those interested can pay to spent more time with the penguins..:). Sightseeing on the chairlift was fun as we had a better view of the whole area including people skiing down the 5 runs. One side of the enclosure is made of glass, through which you can see the 2 floors of the inside of the mall. We waved hi to our parents outside who could see us from the 2nd floor. At the end of the chairlift, be prepared to pose for a snap as it descends. You can collect that photo or a souvenir with your photo on it after you're done with the tour. There were many other rides, including turning down tube slides, snowboarding, running down a slope in a Giant Ball, where you get the effect of running down an avalanche, or simply playing with the snow & throwing snowballs at each other. If you want to learn skiing, this is your best time as you will be guided under professional ski school instructors. Other stuff include kids party rooms, tow lifts, refreshment spots and so on. The next time I visit this place, I'm definitely going to get my friends and learn how to ski."

            "review": "Skiing in the desert - simply because you can. Like much of Dubai, the underlying philosophy behind building a real-snow ski-dome just 25 degrees north of the Equator appears to be: 'why not'?That said, having turned up not knowing what to expect it was a lot better than expected. Checking in and getting kitted up is flawless - there are plenty of staff members on hand, queues are negligible and I was suited, booted and ready to go within 10 minutes of arrival. Lift passes are electronic like all modern ski resorts and flawless in operation. The timer shows you how long you have left to go.The dome itself has both a button lift and - hilariously - a full chair lift. The poma is recommended, since it is significantly quicker. The slope itself is divided into two and is about 380 metres long, which really is very impressive and longer than any such equivalent in Britain. There is a bit of artistic licence taken with the description of a 'black slope' - there is a 10 yard section that is slightly steeper and icier than the rest, but I wouldn't have considered that this qualifies.One recommendation: take gloves! All other kit is provided, which is genuinely fantastic (particularly as you are unlikely to have brought your thermals and ski jacket to Dubai!), but no gloves are provided, and you are going to need them for anything longer than an hour.Overall - you wouldn't (I hope) go to Dubai for the purpose of a skiing holiday, but it is more than worth your while once you are there and is recommended as a result."

We did the Discovery lesson (haven't been skiing since school) and were split into adults, juniors and little ones. My 3 and 6 year old were in a group together with a local child and the older children were in another group with some children from Saudi, husband and I were in an adult group with local adults and some english tourists. We were on the same slopes as the children so they were happy to be seperated from us because they could still see us. We had so much fun that we all booked again for the beginners lesson for 2 days later. The small children did not advance so they did 'Discovery' again, but we still saw them on the slopes having a great time. All the equipment and warm clothes are provided. It can take ages to get fitted out though, so it is better to arrive an hour before the lesson (especially if you have 5 children) so you don't end up late for your lesson. We went on the snow park after the lessons and the children really enjoyed the tobogan runs and seeing the penguins. It was not a cheap day out but you are allowed to stay all day and exit and return as much as you want. Plus it is open until very late at night. Next time we are in Dubai we will definitely go again. We were given a passport to show which skills we had mastered."

You get a jacket, pants, socks, skiis, boots and poles. You have to bring your own hat and gloves. I really didn't need a hat. The equipment is decent. You put the ski card in a pocket on your left sleeve. When you get to a gate just press your sleeve on the post and the gate will open. The card also works on the lockers.They have one quad chair. You can ski to the left or the right of the chair. The one side is a little steeper but both sides could be skied by an intermediate level skier. The snow was good with no ice, There were no lift lines when I was there (Friday at 10 AM). It took a few runs to get use to the equipment. I could get on the lift, ski and return to the lift in 5 minutes. My skiing improved but I got bored after awhile but now I can say \"Yes, I skied Dubai.\" which is why I came here."

I can't comment on what the ski field is like.You can buy hot choclate inside the park. A photographer roams around the area and of course for an extra fee you can buy your picture.We didn't do the penguin experience.The kids came out feeling very cold so they joined me in the cafe and had hot chocolate."

I stuck to the bunny hill and had no complaints whatsoever. My husband did the bigger hills and enjoyed himself as well. One tip would be to bring your own mittens/hat if you have them, so you don't have to buy them. I would give the skiing portion 5 stars.We also did the penguin encounter, which I would give 3 stars. We were fortunate to have a small group of only 4 of us (I think most groups are closer to a dozen) but I still felt like they were rushing us through their usual routine. It was still very neat to be able to pet the penguins and have our pictures taken with them (like Dolphin Bay at Atlantis though, for a hefty price), but I felt a little like I was annoying the penguin trainers with my couple of questions, and that they just wanted to get us out of there. I probably wouldn't recommend the penguin encounter to others."

For about 60 USD (basic package) you get to spend 35-40 min with the penguins in a group of 12 people. The price also includes a pair of \"Ski Dubai\" gloves, they give you a voucher and you pick them up at a ski store next door. First you get to meet two Gentoo penguins, whom you are not allowed to touch but can get pictures taken, then the two King penguins that you can touch or even kiss. Each person gets about 1 minute with a penguin and the guides don't like when you try to touch another penguin outside of your time.You are not allowed to bring your camera or cell phone inside \"for safety of the birds\". You can put them in a locker for a fee. The introductory video they show before going in explains how to behave with the penguins and among other things tells you that \"you don't even have to bring a camera, our photographers will take plenty of pictures for you!\". This is very thoughtful of them, of course, but the video forgets to tell you that they'll charge about 35 USD per printed picture (!) or about 120 USD for a CD with all the pictures, which is pretty outrageous. You get to review the pictures and pick the ones you want before you buy and all the pictures of me were pretty bad and out of focus.Not recommended"

The snowpark which is very tiny with lots of kids stuff and cheap tickets so you will find a lot of kids running around.2. The ski slopes which are huge for an indoor facility but open only to those who already know how to ski/snowboard.The basic ticket only allows you to access snowpark which is not useful at all if you dont have kids.Then there is PowerPass which includes a 1 hr ski lesson and unlimited chairlift rides which you can use to go to the top (for accessing mountain thriller) and ride down (if you don't know how to ski)We had fun with mountain thriller but that was that... there was no further use for the \"unlimited park access\".The ski school here is very professional and the instructors very helpful to all levels.We found the equipment rental area very chaotic and understaffed. There were long lines and quite a lot of commotion. If you've registered for a ski class, then make sure you start getting all your clothing plus equipment atleast 30 minutes before the class starts. Our class was scheduled to start at 3 PM and we started collecting equipment at 2.30 but due to long lines and couple of shoe size changes (very common for new skiiers) we could get ready only by 3.20PM ... the instructor was kind enough to assign us to the 3.30PM class.Also the staff was very helpful when my wife forgot our camera in her jacket and left it in a bin. We got the camera back very quickly as everyone in the clothing area started to search for it in all the collected jackets. Overall it would have been much more worth the money if they had a beginners slope where you could go after a class to practice."

Staff at the checkin were very helpful as I didnt take the voucher I should have printed online (thought my email confirmation would be good enough). We were then sent through to get our Boots and Snow suite. We donned our clothing and now it was 7.20pm. We walked toward the entrance and were advised that we had to meet at the meeting point for our 8pm lesson and to come back in 40 minutes... Off we went for some food in the attached restaurant - we only had a chicken burger. It arrived in good time and the staff were very friendly and courteous.Once at the metting point at 8pm we were taken through into the snow.A few minutes was spent showing us how to stand and which was the best way to stand on the board dependant on if you are right or left footed.We were then taken straight up on the conveyor to the top of the nursery slope.There were around 20 people in our group and there were 3 instructors all of whom were very freindly and funny. They made everyone feel at ease.The lesson went pretty well, and after the first few assisted tries they will let you go down the makey learny slope on your own.Much harder than skiing :-(We had the one hour lesson which is mandatory before you can go on the main slopes.It was a great laugh and everyone seemed to have a good time. Well worth a visit, our tickets for the lesson and all the equipment came to \u00a354 for 2 people including all equipment with the exception of gloves and hat. You should purchase golves before you go in although you can buy them in the Ski shop for 20 Dhs (just over \u00a33)If you are like me you will spend lots of time on your hands so they are a must.Great atmosphere, great instructors and cant wait to go back next week."

We upgraded our selves to the super pass which was a good deal as we wanted to do all the activities, for those who wish to do selected activities can take a regular pass and upgrade with whichever activity you want to do on spot. Clothes, socks and boots are provided in the regular pass, you need to rent the lockers separately. Do take hand gloves ur self or you can purchase it over there in the adjacent shop as your hands will really get numb, there are coffee shops inside, the rides are excellent. And the staff is very helpful, you will at least need about 1- 2 hours in ski dubai minimum. Loved it, great place to be for family, friends, loved ones. I definitely recommend it. One can take the metro to ski dubai as metro station goes right in mall of emirates where ski dubai is located on the ground floor."

I visited Ski Dubai in 2008 and then again this December. I must say nothing had changed though. My favourite part of visiting this place is just to go to the restaurant at the top and enjoy a nice cup of hot chocolate.. Watch out when and if you are going to get the pictures. DO BARGAIN on the price cos they DO bring it down drastically. They had taken some really good pictures this time when I visited with my finance and there were about 7 great picutres but i cant remember the exact package they offered me but they wanted 600 AED and that was not even printing all pictures. But after refusing to buy at that price the privce began to drop to 500, 400, 350, 300, 250 an finally we got to pick out the 10 pictures on a cd for 100 AED which i thought was quite ok."

As such we did find we got cold quickly. If you don't take any kit it can get very expensive buying it all there. The slopes were well groomed and it was great having a choice of slopes. We go fairly regularly to Snowzone, at Milton Keynes, in the UK, so were very impressed to find a chairlift on an indoor slope! There is even a mountain cafe with balcony and patio heaters so you can have a hot chocolate whilst on the slopes. We felt it was a similar price to the UK although you have to book a minimum of 2hrs, rather than one."

The staff was really friendly and one of the safety supervisor was kind enough to let me warm up on the ski school slopes and provides some tips.There main run is divided to two type, black and blue (by Dubai Standard). There are ski chair lift as well as a pulley things to get you up to the top of the slope. The slope it self is covered by snow and in good condition.There is a cafe in the between of the top slope and the bottom slope where you can warm up and enjoy a cup of hot chocolate or sandwich when you need them.Rental equipment are ok, not great but usable. You get everything from locker jacket, pants, poles and ski. The only thing you need is glove or you can buy mitten from nearby store. Damage is 220 dirhams (20 for locker), and if you do anything above 3 hours, I suggest you get the all day package for 100 dirhams moreLots of kids are skiing here in the weekend so it's quite busy and dangerous if you don't get out of the way fast enough as the local kids are doing stunts on the slope and going really fast. Didn't try the park and the penguin attraction so can't comment much on it.One of the best indoor experience I've ever been too, and if you like skiing or just looking to stretch your muscle, you should give it a try."

Just rocked up to the place and got a Power Pass which included an hour's discovery lesson, gear, socks, gloves, hot chocolate, locker and all the rides all day. There is a small pocket on the arm of the jacket to keep your entry card which makes it convenient. The lesson was great, class was small and instructor was attentive. We were even allowed to bring our cameras in and the instructor took videos and pictures when we were able to ski down the slope ourselves. We were able to get quite a few runs down the slope and were confident by the time the hour was up. After the lesson, you go change into rubber boots and do all the other fun things like Zorbing, bob sledding, tubing etc. They are only short runs but still fun and a safe introduction if you have never tried it before. There is also a Penguin show to watch. If you have friends or partners waiting for you, they can go up to the Costa cafe in the mall and watch you from there while having a coffee.I only spent a couple of hours in there as I simply wanted to give it a try. The Power Pass was excellent value as it allowed me to try everything and had I wanted to spend all day in there it would have been an even better deal. I even got a free hot drink after all that. And it's nice that I get to keep my Ski Dubai gloves as a souvenir. What a great way to try so many snow related things in such a short amount of time and for a reasonable fee. If I lived here I would go back again and again until I could master the highest slope!"

We were there when it was quite quiet and it was just a ramble of people, boots, clothing, however everyone seemed to know what they were doing. I did find that most people were more than content with doing the non-skiing activities which made more room on the slopes for everyone else. The size of the place really is quite astounding. The chairlift was amazing but those used to \u2018normal\u2019 chairlifts will find this one remarkably slow. We decided to move to the drag lift which was a bit tricky to work and in some areas, you had to actually turn corners whilst on the lift and manoeuvre yourself around! There was a bit of a slow down and jerk in some places which really caught some people off guard and consequently threw them off!For an intermediate skier, you run can last for a good 45 seconds. Go with a group of friends or family because it is a lot of fun!"

Also, there's no gloves provided (which is contrary to their website), though ski socks were.The 400m run was practically empty when we went and plenty steep enough to do some proper practising.My only complaints were that the lifts were a bit slow and that they didn't provide helmets as standard - there were certainly potential to build up some serious speed from the top of the slope."

It's very interesting as you're learning a lot about them and you can interact with them.We did it with our 4 and 6 years old daughters and it's been a great moment for all of us. The other great thing with the VIP package is you're alone with the pinguins, have a photograph with you all the time and all the pictures are included in your package (private camera/pictures are not allowed in the pinguins area).About the cold, I was wearing a short and a t-shirt, but they provide warm clothes... the pant is warm, but not the top, so when you're at -3C you might regret not bringing a long sleeve t-shirt or a sweatshirt with you... Concerning the feet, they provide snow shoes and socks, but you will leave the place with your feet wet (take an extra pair of socks for after...). They have lockers to drop your bags,...To book it, you can try the Skidubai website, but the online booking wasn't working yet when I've tried, so I had to call to book it in advance."

We turned up, booked a discovery ski lesson for our 2 boys and the top snow park pass for us too. The boys lesson was very good and they loved it. It lasted a full hour and we watched them whilst they learnt the basics. They both want to go again. The snow park was great fun and the rides much better than I expected. It was very busy (Eid holidays) but we never queued for more than a few minutes. Its very hot as you get changed and the ski jackets and trousers were not very clean at all, if these things had been better it would have 5 stars. However it would not stop me from going again.

Better to have some extra warm clothes with you, especially for your head and neck. They do provide jackets and trousers, as well as fleece gloves and socks, but that is not enough. WE had to run out couple of times to make blood run again. My kids have no idea about skiing, so we just had fun sliding on slides. They are not many, but fun enough especially if you've never slid before. I would never go there again, although we do not regret being there. But one time is enough to feel enough. probably for ski-experts its a good option to be able to enjoy their favourite hobby in the middle of the desert......Its like junk food instead of all natural food (when you are hungry and there is nothing else to eat, it can work.

My husband and I just did the two-hour ski pass, which is more than enough time to do the 2/3 trails over and over and over. The ski lift is very slow, so it is good for beginners as well as those that are just riding it as a part of the Snow Park option. The pomel lift is a little more tricky. There are a few spots that it can be challenging if you've never ridden one, or a t-bar before. The rental equipment is just that, rental equipment. Don't expect to get demos here. The Avalanche Cafe is a great mid-slope stop to get a hot chocolate or snack. The deck has portable heaters so it's a nice warm-up from the 30 degree temps on the slope. I recommend going right when they open, because as we were leaving, it was getting incredibly busy and rather chaotic."

We purchased the Snow Park entry (130AED ad and 120AED ch) which gave us entry to the snow area, kiddie toboggan rides, mini snow doughnut rides, use of sleds, hire of boots, pants/jackets, disposable socks and helmets for the kids (under 13s only). Hire did not include a locker nor gloves and I suggest that you definitely source some gloves as it was very very cold on our hands and too cold to finish our snowman (many other tourists had gloves, not sure where they were sourced but BYO gloves if you are a seasoned skier or investigate further). As we entered the ticket sales area we were approached by sales reps promoting the tickets and upgrade packages. The sales rep we had was a little bit vague on what the Snow Park ticket included and strongly suggested that the kids wouldn't be able to ride on anything unless we upgraded to the Super Pass (200AED ad and ch) which included the Snow Park, unlimited Chairlift, Mountain Thriller, Giant Ball, locker and voucher for gloves. We decided against the upgrade and it turned out that we were still able to ride on some fun child-friendly rides and our kids were happy. You can upgrade your tickets once in the park but it is more expensive than purchasing the Super Pass. We didn't see any toilets once inside the park so be prepared, but you can buy drinks once inside. Also, make sure you get a locker as it isn't really convenient to carry backpacks or handbags. Once inside, the views of the ski slope and chairlift were amazing and it was amazing to experience snow in the desert. There also seemed to be plenty of viewinig areas from within the Mall of Emirates (lots of glass everywhere) so perhaps some good spots to grab a coffee while you watch your more adventures family members on the slopes!It was a very fun and unique experience, especially if you or your children haven't experienced snow, however we wont be returning on our next stopover in Dubai."

There are 2 main area in ski dubai: Snow Park where everyone can just play with snow, and the Ski Slope if you want to ski. There are some different passes to choose, just check their website, We choose the \"Snow park pass\" since we were not planning to take a ski lesson with our 5 yo girl, ticket price for those pass are AED130 for adult and AED120 for child (You have to pay more or buy other ticket pass if you want to play some attractions like giant snowball, mountain thriller, etc). We use discount voucher that we found at our hotel and pay less. This pass already included some standard outfit, protector helmet for child, snow boots, and allsize-socks, but not gloves, so better you bring your own gloves if you have, or you can buy it at their store, the cheapest fleece gloves is around AED20. If you are sort of people who can't stand cold, maybe you can also bring/buy beanie, scarf and wear warmer clothes inside the outfit.With so many people stomping around, we couldn't find any fresh snow to build snowman, although my daughter tried her best, with little success, to make a snow angel. The Snow park itself is quite impressive for an indoor park, there are pinguin show and free rides for adult to small children, my daughter enjoy the rides so much. Maybe next time we would try the ski slope - hey, it would be twice in a lifetime then.. :) Don't forget to bring some cash if you want to buy some food or hot drink inside."

My biggest problem is they don't give you gloves, you have to buy them. They provide you with everything else you would need to really, no gloves? Even disposable ones? It is so cold in there we didn't last merely because I was afraid of getting frostbite. There are two runs, and a short park which requires you to have rented a helmet, which we didn't know until we got all the way up there. They have a ski restaurant in the middle of the run where we stopped to get coffee because we were so cold and a little bored. It takes about 10 minutes to get up the lift and 1 minute to get down.

            "review": "6 minute lift up, 40 second run down. This is an impressive engineering feat, having an entire mountain inside of the Mall of the Emirites. Nevertheless, I had a slightly better than fair experience. On the plus side, I think it is very cool (pun intended) to be able to say that you are snowboarding inside, when it is 120 degress outside! Also good was the lift ticket lines. There are helpful people everywhere explaining the different things you can do. Also a plus is that your ticket comes with winter clothes rental (who would bring winter clothes to Dubai?)The biggest minus is that the run is the smallest run I've ever done - and I have snowboarded on some holes in the ground in Ontario, Canada, which is very flat. The lift is very slow, probably done intentionally for those not buying lift tickets but buy winter wonderland tickets that includes a ride up and down the ski lift.Another minus are the local teenagers. It is probably that they don't know any better, but they had no compunction skiing over the front and back of my snowboard while on the line waiting for the lift. If they did this in the rockies or in the East Coast, they'd get their skulls pounded. Probably contributing to this problem is that 99% of the people here are getting rental boards, and people just don't care about other people's property.Lastly, they had helmets for kids, but not for adults. One of the best things about this mountain, is that on the latter half, you can do jumps and land in a giant stunt airbag. Only, you need a helmet to do this, and helmets weren't available as far as I could tell."

But I can at least say I've done it once.You get the options of skiing or just visiting the snowpack to use the rides.Value for money for the point that you can go first thing I the morning and then return as you want as often as you want during the day.The queues for boots and clothing were very long, so if you do decide to leave for lunch, then make sure you stash all your clothing in a locker, so you don't have to queue again!

If you're not much into skiing (like me), there are still lots of things you can do like bobsled runs, tobogganing, riding the giant ball, chair-lift ride, playing in the snow, or just drinking hot chocolate and enjoying the view from the Avalanche cafe at the top of the slopes. Plus, if you don't mind spending an extra 175 AED, you can get to meet some snow penguins! The photos are really expensive but the experience is so worth it. Staff are very friendly, accommodating, and knowledgeable \u2013 especially the trainers at the Penguin Encounters.A few tips:1. The queues can be very long (around 15-minute wait) especially when lining up to get your toboggan/sled. Make sure you secure your sled because some people would just steal it from you while you're not looking. Then, you'd have to line up again. Boo!2. Unless you have the money (and willing to spend 500-850 AED), the 175 AED for the penguin encounter is already worth it. The photos afterwards can be very expensive so better if you have a companion with you to share on the cost. You can split the 550 AED photo package which includes 1 big picture, 2 smaller pictures, 2 keychains with pictures, 1 snow globe, plus a CD of ALL your pictures during the encounter."

But I certainly do recommend this for kids age 6 up. Don't be confused with the snow slope (where you can ski but this is for those who knows how to ski. For the beginner, you have to go for a lesson and pay extra before you can experience the thrill) and the snow park which is like paying an expensive 130 dhs for punishing yourself by locking up in a freezer. Snow slope is limited for an hour only, pay extra if you want more while snow park has unlimited time. But who can last inside with not much attractions. Kids can certainly enjoy inside the snow park especially those who have grown up on countries without the snow. My advise to those who are curious to get inside the snow park: bring your own gloves and bonnet (very expensive when bought inside-cheapest pair of gloves is 20dhs), go with a group to save on the locker (20dhs), when you see a sled (for kids) grab it as this would be the last fun you'll have to last longer inside and compensate the costly entrance fee."

If you don't ski or board I wouldn't pay the money to ride up to the top as its not that impressive, but it depends of course whether or not you have seen real snow before. A better idea would be to play on the tubes or the huge rubber ball for a more fun experience. Be prepared for people trying to jump the queue, as is commonplace in Dubai.

Mall of the Emirates | Shiekh Zayed Road, Dubai, United Arab EmiratesI went on this activity for two hours while on an epic holiday covering four countries in June 2012.Snowboarding/skiing in the deserts of the UAE is a must while in Dubai\u2026 but only once. Just so you can say that you've conquered the longest indoor snow slope in the world (400m long with a right hand turn in the middle). I went on the slopes on my own. As Ski Dubai was located in the Mall of the Emirates, it was no problem for her to go shopping! You can easily get to the Mall of the Emirates/Ski Dubai using public transport (MRT). The MRT stop is called Mall of the Emirates. Once you arrive at the location, Ski Dubai will be a bit of a pain to find as the mall is massive. Get a mall map and/or ask people while you try to find signs. I turned up on the reception door on a June evening for some slope time, where it was not busy at all\u2026 only 5 to 10 people on the main slope. You could always book lessons or slope time online too.I missed out on using a voucher for 10% off on slope time. Scour the internet or any voucher booklets beforehand.The package included:- Jacket- Trousers (both jacket and trousers were cosy)- Ski boots/Snowboard boots (make sure that they fit prior to you heading out\u2026 it's a pain and time wasting otherwise to go back and refit)- Skis + poles/Snowboard (Rossignol Snowboards\u2026 they are actually not bad for rentals... but doesn't beat my own board)- Free Disposable Socks- Helmets (for children)YOU WILL NEED TO BRING GLOVES/BUY GLOVES beforehand. I brought my own as I foresaw that I will go here. I also brought a warm hat with me.Make sure that you are a decent snowboarder/skier who can link turns, otherwise you'll get kicked off the slope.Lockers are 20AED and are only ONE TIME USE. So make sure you got everything but you hit the slopes\u2026 ski pass, gloves etc.The outdoors area comprised of:- Main slope which is split up in two mini sections. The lift allows you to get off halfway for tobogganing and a cafe area and also those who want to warm up on the main slope first before hitting the top of the 400m long main run.- Children's area (separate from main slope)- Tobagganing (at the side of the bottom half of the main slope)- Big Ball where you roll down a hill (separate from main slope)There were three main freestyle bits nearer the top of the main slope. A few boxes and kickers, but that was all.This package in my opinion was expensive compared to an indoor ski slope in the UK, but I guess it takes a lot of money to run an indoor ski slope (and is twice as long than the UK's longest slope) in Dubai\u2026Overall, two hours was good. But I would only do this once.

It took us awhile to figure out how it all worked, we spent some time figuring out what package to get etc. but once that is worked out things run pretty efficiently. we took the package that included a lesson. skis, boots, EVERYTHING is provided. We were the only ones in the lesson, which was excellent. 2 instructors to ourselves. A chairlift to boot!! A very unique experience."

The rides were so much fun - only downside was that as the day grew later the crowds grew bigger. My advice go early, we got there just as they opened. This way you can ride everything without the lines. By afternoon the crowds are insane, you can hardly walk inside and the lines to the rides are crazy. We got an all day pass, a summer special deal, and had ridden everything several times by early afternoon. By the time the crowds became crazy about 4-5 pm we were more than ready to leave. One big problem, the people in that region DO NOT know how to stand in line, no matter how the employees try to organize the crowds by making them stand in line (there are stanchions that form the lines as in other amusement parks) only the Western guests obey the lines(when I say Western guests I include people of different nationalities who reside in Europe, US, etc.), everyone else pushes, shoves, and argues their whole family to the front...the adults were worse than the children. It got very stressful and we found ourselves being shoved back and stomped so many times that we decided to call it a day around 5 pm. They even stomped and shoved my little 4 year old grandson.Have to admit this is an issue I've seen many times in this part of the world. Love the people, they really are very nice, as long as they aren't in a situation where they must stand in line! Then they just get very aggressive and very argumentative!"

Considering its situated in Dubai, I thought the snow was awesome. The size is decent. There are only two runs, so I suggest only purchaseimg the two hour pass. Go in the morning too because all of the kids will be taking lessons and the hills aren't packed. In the afternoon, they all go up on the hills. The lifts move extremely slow, it's about a 5 min trip up the hill. There is a tow rope that moves about twice as fast, but it's at an aggressive incline and tough for snowboarders.The lift ticket includes equipment and clothing rental. It was sufficient gear for the conditions. I was wearing shorts and a tshirt under the cost and pants. Didn't get cold until the end. The temperature inside is -5C. The rental doesn't include gloves or a hat. I didn't need a hat, but as a snowboarder I wanted gloves. The ski Dubai gloves were about 20AED, which is cheap. But if you're going to do the penguin encounter, you get free gloves with that ticket.If you enjoy skiing and snowboarding, you have to go just to say you did it!"

When we went this morning, it was a sweltering hot and humid 45 degres celsius (in the shade) outside but the thermometer inside Ski Dubai was showing 2 to 3 degres below zero, that is powerful air conditioning! It was very busy, with many children and families enjoying the real snow and the new attraction of some cute penguins around a small pond. New also is the little cafe near it where you can buy a soft drink. Before you enter Ski Dubai, you have to put on the good winter equipment which is provided: snow boots, ski trousers and big coats. There are even long coats for the gents who wear dishdashs and ladies in abayas. It is all well organised. There are two separate parts in ski Dubai, one just to have a little fun in the snow, see the penguins, and the other part for the serious skiers who take the ski lift to get to the top of the ski run. I liked it but it made me a little nostalgic for les Deux Alpes, where the sky is high and blue and the snow is snow white, not a lighter shade of grey. But it is great and, after getting a little cold, it is nice to sit in cafe Saint Moritz, just near Ski Dubai and warm yourself at the \"fire place\" and have a lovely lunch enjoying the view of the slope."

Not sure I would get the day pass again because after 2pm it was very crowded with kids understandably. No water bubblers at a sporting venue I think is poor form, none of the vending machines were working and the staff didn't care about my concern or had any delegated responsibility to be able to fix it.

I was with a colleague and we both had our jaws down while witnessing what any echology defender would consider an horror movie: people skiing in a desert area. In front of this scenario I felt like I was in front of the demonstration of the power of money, and the power of manhood to revert natural laws. So, a bit scary rather than wonderous and hilarious. My experience, of course.The ski area is IMMENSE, with pines, snow storm, women in chador and winter jackets playing snow balls with their children.I could hardly comment with my colleague, We both left without words, with a feeling that something is going wrong on this planet.For those who ski, I think you must try it. When you go home in Europe or anywhere else and tell your granda, she won't believe you. And probably she's right."

Ski Dubai is awesome, that's the only word that can sum it up!Get up in the morning, head to the beach or the pool, have a break from the sun for some lunch, more sun then once you've had enough, hop on the metro and get off at The Mall of the Emirates. Follow the signs for Ski Dubai (you can't miss it).The snow is perfect, the slope is long and varied, even with a bit of a black run! There is a chair lift to the middle or top and a beginners escalator at a seperate beginners area.The kit is top notch (carvers), the ski suits are warm, the only thing I'd recommend you take is proper ski gloves and ski socks, it is COLD!After your session head downstairs to Apres' for a drink and a tabasco and prawn pizza (delicious) and watch fellow skiers fly down the slopes.If you don't fancy a pizza, head to The Butcher Shop & Grill for the most amazing steak. Try the mixed cuts kebab for a chunk of every cut of mean, medium-rare of course!"

To enjoy this place to the maximum, you will need to stay inside a minimum of 2 hours especially if you've got kids who from my experience simply go crazy once they hit the snow. Go there with extra warm clothing if you are not from a cold climate area as the warm clothing they give at the entrance wouldnt really keep you warm enough if you are not used to the cold. Take a pair of extra socks too. YES! its that cold. The only snag is that it is a bit too expensive if you are going as a large family. We are a family of 6 and once an admission fee goes beyond 50 dirhams we begin to sweat."

I would have liked to see them build it in an area where there is more oppurtunity to expand, however, it's pretty sweet regardless. It is a tad overpriced for my liking but it's fun for families as it has the penguins, snowtubing and skiing.

Such funny little creatures and so much fun to spend a bit of time with. Also an important educational aspect to the experience, as in one of fastest growing energy using cities in the world, there was an environmental message of saving energy and saving electricity to save the poles and the penguins. Possibly ironic in what was basically a giant freezer, but important all the same.The one down side, and the lasting impression, was the rip off in respect of photographs. You're told you cant take cameras in as the penguins can eat items such as camera size (including my DSLR - really??) but its okay because they take photographs. To buy a single photo was \u00a320, to buy the CD-Rom/DVD of photographs you also had to buy various other size photos and a snow globe at about \u00a3100. No option to just buy the CD-Rom/DVD. Thing is, we'd have maybe paid \u00a350 for the CD-rom/DVD but were no way paying \u00a3100 for the set. As it is, we only bought one photo at \u00a320. Speaking to other people, they did a very similar thing, and I saw nobody at all buy the full package. Ski Dubai - bring down the prices and then people would spend more!"

The supposed black diamond run was more like a bunny slope and the chair lift was too slow to make the experience fun. The only good part was that it was so cold there that I was able to cool off from the intense Dubai heat. The snow park was mainly for the small children and not adults. The gift shop was sadly lacking in Ski Dubai souvenirs so that too was a bust."

For the accomplished skier you may be board after an hour but for anyone wanting a quiet, relatively wide slope with good snow to practice on, this is just the ticket. I love they way they provide all the kit except gloves and hat in the price. Faults are few; they could do with opening the drag lift before 1200 as the chair lift is terribly slow and wastes too much time (or plan on skiing after 12 but it does become busier at weekends). Give the skiers the priority on the chair lifts over those in there for the ride only, can be annoying waiting while the non-skiers faff around trying to get on/off the chair lift. Otherwise great value especially if you use your 2 for Entertainer vouchers (3 in each issue)."

We did the penguin encounter at Ski Dubai on a friday afternoon, having pre-booked the time slot a couple of days earlier at the penguin encounter desk outside ski dubai a few days earlier. The entrance fee is pretty steep at 175Dhs a head (no discount for children). This includes ski suits, gloves, socks and boots, and for the kids only, helmets. I was worried about how to get my elderly mother into a ski suit but she was able to use the floor length button down jackets which fit directly over her clothes. There was an introductory chat about the penguins but the 2 others who joined my family of 6 were not interested and pushed the guide to rush through this. Once in the enclosure two penguins were brought in by the trainers and one by one we knelt down to pat them. All the while two photographers snapping away taking photos of us. The trainers were extremely knowledgeable and happy to answer any and all questions that we had. After the 40 minute slot ended we had all had a turn and the kids were starting to feel cold (you take your gloves off to touch the penguins). You are not allowed to take your own camera into the enclosure. If that is because multiple flashes might frighten the penguins, then I have some sympathy, but the price of the professional photos is too much. For the high entrance fee I would expect a photo to be included. Otherwise, it was a much loved experience for my group (with an age range of 4 to 73)."

Overall it is pretty expensive to visit just to Toboggan or Tube and you would only need about 1hr here with little ones.

The Mall of Emirates is considered to be an old mall (?!) and has significantly less visitors than the Dubai Mall (good selection of high street shops and Jewellery stores). It's advantage is that it can be reached by Metro and it has an enormous ski slope. The ski gear hire is included in the price and, if you like fun in the snow, it could be a great activity. Ski lifts, nursery and high slope together with instructors makes a pretty good package. The near by Kempinsky Hotel sells rooms with a 'Ski Slope' view. Good attraction if you like to ski. "

It's just the fact that all this has been built and is maintained in a desert climate that is the amazing thing about it. But it basically amounts to an activity that the (bigger) kids can do while the mothers are shopping, or after school, etc., which was plainly evident when we were in the locker room below. However we were in good company also because there were a couple of other people like us who were obviously just trying it out for an experience. Go do it and enjoy, or just sit in one of the cafes adjoining the slope and watch the other people skiing. Tip: You'll get a jacket and pants to wear, but make sure you wear everything you own under it, because it is COLD. (This from an avid skier!)"

The adults went for 2 hours of skiing on the slopes while my children were attending the discovery ski class. After that, we had lunch at the cafe just outside of Ski Dubai, before venturing to the ski park. It was pretty complicated paying for entry. Everything is calculated separately. So it's 2 ski slope access, 2 discovery lessons and 4 ski park entry tickets. I thought it would have been nice if they could have a package price for families...even if it's not discounted, it much easier to know at one glance the cost? We also wanted to have lunch at Avalanche cafe, but because the children has no access to the ski lifts (while we did), we couldn't visit the cafe for lunch. I thought it would make biz sense for them, if say, adults can bring their children along for lunch up there on mid slope?Very good fun overall. My children (3.5 and 6) really enjoyed themselves, though I did get a little bored after going down the slope after 3 times. :p Maybe it's just me. But the snow park with the kids was a lot of fun for us."

I had a 2 hour pass for the skiing itself.You must be able to ski to be allowed to use the slopes, unless you sign up for a beginners lesson. The slopes may not be very challenging for very good skiers. On the lower slope, it took 6-7 minutes to go up on the chair lift and ski down. For the upper slope, a \"round trip\" took 10-11 minutes.I have learned to wear warm clothes under the jacket they give you, as well as warm gloves and hat. Otherwise, you will start to feel the cold quickly and not enjoy the experience so much. Also, do ensure your equipment fits and works perfectly. Know your European shoe size (i.e. size 38).There are many attendees, particularly monitoring the chair lift and very focussed on safety. As a woman there by herself, I always feel safe and secure - although not always when I'm whizzing down the slope!!"

Things change when you finally battle your way through the crowds with your rental skis. Not many local people can ski, they tend to go round and round on the chairlift, or have a go on the small 'fun' rides; snow tubes, etc. So the slope is pretty much empty. It's a fun experience, not at all difficult for even novice skiiers like myself. Top to bottom takes about 2 or 3 mins. But it's pretty high with a 45 degree kink in the slope half way down (where there is also a ski chalet serving hot drinks, even more surreal). It was quite a hoot, but you do get a bit bored after your 5th or so run. Then you can do what i did, retire to the nearby bar which overlooks the slope from the shopping centre and sip a hot gluh wine. Like I say, surreal but fun to experience... once."

Checkin and equipment collection is very quick and efficient if you get there early enough. In the afternoon, it gets a bit crowded and things slow down a lot. With super passes, you get free gloves on top of all the equipment which was a nice touch. Lockers were readily available, spacious and easy to locate and use.Staff were all helpful in giving directions, etc.We got super passes for the snow park, and then booked a discovery snowboard lesson (already knowing how to ski, we thought we'd try something new.)First of all, the snow park:The snow park has a bunch of attractions, mostly intended for kids, but quite fun for teens and adults too, especially the mountain thriller. We arrived before opening time and were the very first ones to get in. All the staff were very friendly, showing us around personally and offering to take pictures of us (with our own cameras, not that DigiPhoto tourist trap). They also brought tubes for us for the mountain thriller and the tobogganing. We did the attractions near the entrance such as the snow ball, bobsledding, etc. then headed up on the ski lift for the mountain thriller. We were told that it wasnt open yet as they were doing some final security checks on it, so we did the whole panoramic loop on the ski lift. We then went on the mountain thriller on double tubes, and got stuck a few times because the grids they use for brakes weren't placed properly. Staff rushed towards us to help, and quickly fixed the issue. Overall, the snowpark is great fun but will get a bit boring after a couple hours if you're not a kid.After a quick lunch at the St Moritz cafe, we went for the discovery snowboard lessons. The instructor came off as quite rude and aggressive, but ended up warming up and being really friendly and quite chatty. Despite being in a quite large group, he managed to keep everyone under control and dedicated some time for each person, especially if they were struggling. It was really fun and well worth the 75 aed (50% off per person since we all had snow pass and penguin passes.)Finally, meeting the penguins is something you cannot miss. We went at 12pm as a group of 4 (3 of us + 1 other person), so we essentially got an exclusive tour (worth 500 aed pp) for a fraction of the price. We got a lotOf time and pictures taken with the penguins. The trainers are very friendly and give clear instructions as to what can be done with the animals. Hugging a penguin is an absolutely unforgettable experience. They are lovely animals and being around them is a true pleasure. One bad thing about the penguin experience is that no phones or cameras are allowed, because they claim that if a penguin can eat a large fish, they can also eat phones, but in reality it's to force you into buying a photo package from DigiPhoto (starting at 100 AED per picture!!!) but for this kind of experience, you cannot really complain as it is a once in a lifetime kind of thing, of which memories should be made permanent.Overall, if you're looking for a fun filled day and escaping Dubai's searing heat for a while, you will love SkiDubai. If you're in Dubai, add SkiDXB to your must do list!"

It doesn't feel cold at first with shorts and a t-shirt under the supplied outwear, but the cold feeling builds and you do eventually feel chilly. If you are the type to feel the cold, I'd recommend a long sleeve shirt under the jacket. Indoors it is as crazy as you would expect from Dubai. There is a chair lift, snow, and a mid mountain chalet to stop for a drink. The chair lift is slow. If you want to get up the hill a bit faster, there is a button tow lift on the far left. It isn't a beginner lift as it does slow and then jerk you a bit forward. You need to be able to control your skis or board on the ride. As others have said, the ski time down the \"mountain\" is about 30 seconds. It is just a step up from a bunny hill. If you are an experienced skier, the mountain won't hold your attention for more than an hour or two, but, really, it is all about the experience anyway.It seemed like most of the locals stayed in the snow park and just rode the chair lift for the experience. So while the place was crowded, the mountain wasn't overly crowded. I'm sure the show chair lift helps crowd control on the mountain. Our family of 5 (2 adults, 3 kids aged 13, 11, and 8) had a fabulous time. We went at night after a day at the beach/pool. Ski Dubai stayed open until midnight the night we went (Saturday) so there was no need to cut into our day of fun in the sun."

The lower kids slope is rather biring with very poorly kept dirty snow for a play around and a couple of slides that will keep the kids ineterested for about an hour. As an adult around 5 times down the same slide with your kids is just enough! The upper slopes are more interesting for the experienced skiers and snow boarders."

At a good speed you get down from top to bottom in 30 seconds. The lift takes over 5-10 minutes back up and is really really really slow. So you spend 90% of the time in the lift, unless you are just learning to ski, which is an excellent place to do it. The place has a very artificial feel to it (with an 'avalanche' cafe on top, right....). Snow quality I expected to be much better given the controlled conditions, icy in some places, mushy in others. Ski jackets that are included in the ticket price are thin and do not keep you warm if you just wear a t-shirt underneath."

The least we could do is stop by.We are not skiers, but thought \"ahh.. lets just go ahead and waste the money on a cheesy tourist attraction\". Surprisingly we were wrong. A very nice experience for the money. Great design and crowd control. We visited after having brunch at Burj al Arab, which is a short distance away and a Cheap taxi ride. Friday morning, Mall was bustling but not packed /crowded. We were able to walk up and buy tickets after only a 2-5min wait in line. We have waited much longer at many other american places. We did not do the skiing, because the next ski lesson was an hour later and we didnt want to miss our desert safari. Chose instead the Fun park pass- You can tube, sled, ride the chair lift and roll down the hill in giant plastic ball, all day for 57 dollars. Even got a chance to see the penguins from afar as group did their personal penguin encounter. Why must you do this? This place is HUGE... and it is contained within a mall! I mean really! I thought it would be this one little old ski slope and some finely crushed ice and long lines of people and crowds hovering around it. NOO! It is more like a mini-snow-theme park with A huge ski slope ....within a mall - just the ridiculousness of it all.. YOU MUST DO IT. and this is not even the largest mall in the world! You MUST ride the ski lift to appreciate the magnitude because it turns 45 degrees around a corner. This does not included a snow cave/maze with ice sculpture, a mini-track to sled, a mini hill to go tubing down.The size of the ski park which you can admire from inside the mall, without paying money to go in - does not even include the assoicated facilities - The large area where there are multiple lines to get your snow pants, jacket, boots. The somewhat thin-fleecelike gloves are obtained from the nearby ski shop. Can you get warmer, thicker more weather appropriate gloves to use in the -3 C temps?... Yes. But come on! if you really want expert gear, and top of the line conditions- you would not be in dubai, you would be at Lake Tahoe. Besides they are embroidered with \"SKI Dubai: you get to keep them and they make excellent souvenirs! We had a blast! If you are scared to take pictures with your camera ( dropping it in snow/damage etc) or too busy having fun, dont worry they have photographers running around taking your pictures throughout the park. They will hand you bracelets with the code on them to recover your pics for a fee when you are done. DO THIS! It sounds pricey BUT there is an option for you to combine ALL the pics they take of you on one CD...... No matter how many there are. This is a great deal. Wish we would have known this, we would have taken more pictures. Very well organized, wasnt crowded. no long waits. This was probably one of my best theme park experiences ever. Seriously. We were able to walk up purchase tickets, ride/view all of the experiences at least once in less than 1hr and half on a Friday afternoon (12-130pm). Of course you can spend all day here if you like, but I think 2hrs was plenty of time for young adult tourist couple. I dare you to try that at Disney and Six Flags. Amazing! So glad we did it!Tip: Ladies try to get a larger size snowboot and wear your provided socks with your ballet flats inside the snow boots for a nice snug/sturdy fit. I wore my snow suit over my sundress and felt perfectly fine! Dont worry about dressing for snow! Come in your summer attire and put the thick snow attire over it and walk out for some sledding- Ha! It will add to the ridiculous feeling of it all!Bring a durable/water/snowproof water bottle holder that you can strap along you underneath your snow suit. You will be active, there is water available inthe vending machines, and lockers are included with you fee. But you will want to keep your water with you- This place is too big to be running out to your locker everytime you want to take a sip.Lots of fun!"

Its definitely one of the place to visit with your childrens. Want to wow them, have a good time with them? Then head here.Its literally a very very big snowpark and gives you the feeling of being in a realtime snow environment. The temperature inside is as low as -3 providing chills down your spine. There are so many adventure rides inside for all age group. What stands out is the chairlift which takes you high above to your drop off point. Thrill junkies can ski down the long slopes which is suitable for both amateurs and professionals alike. There are many classes for ski wherien the guides train you properly for the whole procedure.All the attractions aside, it does have some flaws. They charge an extra money for getting the glove, which is a lot. My brother and me stayed gloveless due to this and almost froze our hands to death. So I advise that you carry your own gloves with you beforehand. Another suggestion is that if you do take a pass, try to spend as long as 3-4 hours. Peoples going for just an hour may not benefit as they charge the same price for a day as compared to an hour. So free off some time and spend quality moments here. Overall, definitely a must visit."

I gave it 5 stars because this was a lot easier then driving several hours to a ski resort and lugging equipment around and dealing with the cold. And 2 hours was enough time. I think this is a great opportunity for first time skiers or snowboarders, to see if they like the sport. Also, great to take the family to experience snow with the other activities. Located in the Mall of the Emirates. Our taxi driver dropped us off at the Kempinski Hotel because this was the closest to Ski Dubai. This is a drop off area only. (You need to go between Harvey Nichols and Debenhams to pick up a taxi. We had to queue up, but it went quickly. There is one other drop off/pick up at the other end of the Mall). Walk straight back, the slope is to the right.On the right you pass the giant windows. If you go with non-snow people they can watch from here or in 1 of the 2 restaurants that look into the snow area. There are a few steps, and a ramp for wheelchair and strollers. On the left you stand in line to purchase a ticket. I paid 180 AED, $49 USD, for 2 hours to ski, plus 20 AED deposit fee - for what I\u2019m not sure. I used a credit card and they charged 200 AED. You'll actually lose money from the exchange rate, extra charges. So you don\u2019t really get 20 AED back. Suggest you pay in AED. Remember to return the Key Card, which is your ticket, to get your 20 AED back at the deposit machine.I was told it was very crowded on weekends. So plan wisely.To save time, if touring with others, have them stand in the ski clothes/boots queue, while you buy the tickets. Find a queue with as few children as possible. They don\u2019t move as fast as adults. You will get a ski jacket, pants and socks (good thickness). You try on 1 boot here to see if it fits. I'm 5 '3 and took a M in the jacket and pants. It was a bit big. There is velcro at the wrist and the waist. Take care with delicate fabric. The jacket only has snaps, no zipper in front. Remember to bring your own hat and gloves. There is a ski store between the ticket counter and the equipment dispensing area. Put the Key Card in the zipper in the left arm - leave it there until you change clothes. Three are no other pockets in either piece. They also distribute full-length winter coats - for those just walking around the snow. Then proceed to the next counter to get your skis. (You may want to change first so you are not burdened with the skis. Or, have one person change, one person stand in the ski queue, then switch, to save time).I didn't see a changing room, nor did I actively look for one. I went into the handicap bathroom to change out of my skirt. I just had a light shirt on, and I stayed warm in my jacket. There is a nominal non-refundable locker fee.The staff told me the temperature was -4C/24.8F.Once you're ready to go to the slope, you pass on the left, the gates, under the changing screen: Slope Here. Put the Key Card up to the gate to enter. You walk to the escalator. I had the employee carry my skis on the escalator as I was not comfortable. At the top you select your ski pole size. Walk out the doors and you\u2019re on the slope. Take a picture of you and the slope. Ski to the chair lift. Very ingenious - you move your left arm near the sensor and the turnstile booth keeps track of your time: it countdowns the minutes and displays the time. Your time, 2 hours, STARTS from this point. The chairlift seats 4 people. You must pull down the safety bar. It interchanges between skiers and walkers. The staff said they slowed it because of the walkers. The walkers stay on for the round trip or can get off at the Chalet. It\u2019s around 8 minutes to get to the top of the slope. So it can go quicker if they change the speed.Midway is a chalet to have some drinks. You can get off the chairlift here to ski down or stay on and take it to the top. Along the side of the building, there is a poma lift, a disk attached to a bar, attached to a pulley. To activate it, the top of the pole must pull against the vertical rod to release it. Usually, there is someone to help. This will pull you up to the top of the slope in a fraction of the time of the chairlift. The track is not smooth. It stops and goes. When it starts again, it YANKS you. I was fine, but men, I worry about your future children. I didn\u2019t hear any men yell, so I guess it's safe, but you have been warned! From the start of this area. you can look over the side. This is were they bring out the penguins. I think, every two hours. Check the time on the boards in the ticket purchasing area screens.Ski slope: One section is Experts only, but this would be an Intermediate on a Lake Tahoe resort. There were no moguls. There is a ski jump under the chalet and a staff member is stationed there. On the other side of the slope there are metal things that you can jump onto and slide on. I presume for snowboarders. Against the wall you can take the donut sleds and slide down a snow slide. There is staff.Other activities: There are giant clear balls you go inside and you roll down the hill, there are 2 tube/slides., penguin parade. and the website said there is a snow cavern - which I just learned of while writing this. I will assume if walkers can come into the ski area, perhaps it\u2019s possible to walk into thier area, to see the penguins and the snow cavern.You can also buy ski and snowboarding lessons.When your time is up. Exit the slope. There is a machine to warm up your glasses to de-fog them. Return your poles. Head down the escalator, drop off your skis on the shelves. Exit the turnstiles. Return boots to shelves. Take off jackets/pants and REMEMBER TO TAKE THE KEY CARD out of the sleeve. Go out towards the ticket counter and put Key Card into the machine and get your 20 AED back.http://www.skidxb.com/"

I had to go there, if just for the bragging rights.Checking in was pretty easy. After lolling in a slow line to pay for a two-hour ticket ($60 or so, including clothing and locker), I moved on to collect my boots, socks, ski pants, and jacket. From there I went into the locker room and changed, before getting my skis. I didn't bother with gloves or hat since I figured it couldn't be that cold.I then went up an escalator where I picked up my ski poles. Then it was just a few steps through a glass door into a winter wonderland.Right in front of you is a chairlift, and behind that is a J bar that tows skiers up the hill. You place the access card you are given into the upper left sleeve of your coat so that you can open the turnstile that allows access to the lifts. The card reader is on the left, right below shoulder level.For the first couple of runs, I took the chairlift. There's a stop midway, about 100 vertical feet up, and then one at the top. After you get off, you can turn right and go down the moderate/easy hill or turn left and go down the \"black diamond\" hill.In no sense was the left-side hill black diamond, especially since a ski instructor was teaching kids how to parallel ski on the hill. But it was steeper than the other one, and it had two sets of slalom poles to ski through. Lower down there is a pretty big jump, but it was closed off.There were never more than 2 or three skiers/snowboarders around me at any time--I was there on a Tuesday from 5:30 pm to 7 pm, but I'd say most skiers were Westerners, either travelers or expats.Word of warning if you use the J bar. The sign says \"Expert Skiers Only,\" which I scoffed at. I'm far from an expert skier, but it didn't look too hard. The first trip up, the guy in front of me fell off, and his ski went sliding between my legs. The next time up, I almost fell off at a very steep section of the trail. The third time was the charm, so to speak. At the base of the very steep section, the lift stopped for a few minutes. As I was adjusting my ski tips, not paying much attention, the lift yanked me upward powerfully, pulling me out of one of my skis. I held onto the bar with one hand while retrieving my ski with the other. But I fell off balance to my left side, close to the wall. As I held on, the knuckles of my left hand scraped against the wall, tearing off skin and leaving my knuckles bright red. I had to let go and roll off the track onto the slope. Very embarrassing, though I noticed later that very few people used the J bar, and several other people had similar mishaps.Besides that mental trauma, it was worth the experience of skiing indoors in Dubai, feeling (and tasting) snow. It ain't Breckenridge, but it's worth a go."

Socks included in rental. Skies were perfect. Bring your own gloves, otherwise for hygienic reasons you need to buy them locally. Hours of plain fun, just because it is so absurd! A must-see for every ski fan when you just so happen to be there, although it could make you worry about the tons of energy that must go through the cooling system."

I guess it will make the visit more interesting if you are not actually used to the real snow. The snow park consists of few simple slides and other snow play options. One thing worth remembering is that the snow here is not necessarily soft and fluffy as you would often find with natural fresh snow. The sides of the slides are of hard snow. So please do take care of the elbow and make sure the little ones have good protective wear. The ski slope is only for people who know skiing. The ski slope looked nice with a reasonable length for an artificial park such as this.Protective clothing is available as part of the ticket price. This includes jacket, trouser, boots and helmet for children. If you have ski/slope pass then I think you get all the skiing gear as well. Lockers, changing space and toilets are just opposite to the counter where you collect your accessories. Gloves and hats are not part of the above so please take them if you have. They also sell them in case you haven\u2019t got them with you. The temperature maintained inside the park is below freezing and it was reading -4 degree Celsius when we visited. If you have paid for the locker then make sure you get the money back by surrendering the electronic key/watch in one of the automatic machines while coming out of the entrance. If you are from places where you get to experience the real snow then you may not find this exciting. Also, just to get a view of this place you don\u2019t need to go inside and you can have good look from inside the mall itself. But, while in Dubai amidst and heat and sand, this place offers a change and more of a holiday adventure feel, especially if you have small children."

The quality of the snow is pretty good, surprisingly (based on snow I've experienced in Utah, London and California). It feels like being inside a giant freezer inside. The $60 admission includes boots, pants and a jacket. Unfortunately, you only get gloves with the Zorb area, not for ski/snowboarding. I don't know why, because they're cheap, disposable gloves.

My daughter had a great time until the large crowds of people starting coming in. My suggestion is that a limited number of tickets are sold so that everyone can enjoy their experience. I had to leave because I was worried about my daughter getting trampled on. Before the crowds came she was able to really enjoy all the rides in the snow park. The snow outfits were clean and kept us warm. I will go back again, but never again during the school holiday."

I would suggest going in the morning or early afternoon, especially when you are a beginner, because late afternoon the snow already turned into ice and this can cause quite a few falls, ask me!!!"

Imagine an indoor man-made ski hill in the middle of a desert country! The amount of money spent on this thing! Of course, it's nothing compared to the Rockies or the Alps, but it was a nice refreshing alternative to what Dubai has to offer which are shopping and skyscrapers. Ski Dubai offers ski classes for beginners. It's really perfect for anyone beginning to snowboard as well. There are two runs available avering between easy and intermediate. Ski Dubai prices are very affordable...about 180 Dhs for two hours including rental of skis and clothing. We need to bring our own hats and gloves though. Otherwise, they have a store selling those for a hefty price. There is a snow park for small children. Definitely a place that kids would love. Two hours are more than sufficient to experience this to the fullest! Beware advanced skiers, the runs are not amazing and can get boring. But I can guarantee one thing: no ice patches! An experience for your bucket list!"

But when you're in Dubai, this is part of daily life anyway.Ski Dubai offers you a little treat and gives you a glimpse of winter. You can choose between skiing and tobogganing. The main lift to the top takes about 4 minutes, as opposed to the downhill fun which only lasts for a bit less than a minute if you are experienced enough. There is a limited choice of difficulty offering a bit of variety. However, if you are an experienced skier you will start feeling bored after an hour and the excitement will fade out.Hungry for a treat at the coffeeshop? You will find a large variety of juices, hot beverages and soft drinks. If you are craving for something more spicy you will have to content yourself with watching the crowds at Apr\u00e8s Bar which is part of the Kempinski Hotel. The coffeeshop is not licensed.In a nutshell, it's a very nice one-off experience considering where you are. However in terms of quality and choice I would consider it slightly overrated."

First of all, the entire complex and all equipment were in excellent shape and hygiene. All instructors (Maria, Owen, Julianne, Mahmoud, Hafid & Mehdi) we met were great with our son who could not in fact understand most of what they said in English to him! They took their job very serious to make sure he learned the basics of skiing properly. We were given a Skiing Passport, in which after each private lesson the instructor mentioned my son's progress and signed. My son is still very proud of his passport! He was, in fact, taken to skii on the experienced level slope by the 5th lesson. Since August is low- season in Dubai, this attraction was not very crowded at all until the last two days which was Eid for the Muslim. So we paid for group lessons to have private ones instead."

The slope is about 400 m and temperature and surroundings are carefully monitored at about -1degree celcius. this makes for excellent environment to learn skiing or to get really good at it. The whole system is very well organized and based on trust (to return boots and clothes).Everything is provided in your rental fee, including ski equipment and clothes, but bring your own hat and gloves. they provide socks disposable but quite thick!. no need to bring your goggles as it is not that bright. Toilets are large and the lay out is very clear and organized. Only minor complaint was that we only had options of the standard 2 hour slope pass, or the full day pass. This was despite that the flyer that we had indicated that we could get an hour extension at a lower rate. I guess it did not make business sense for them. in the end , most who would want to ski more than 2 hours, would either have to buy the full day pass, (about 80AED more than the 2 hour) or once you run out of time , buy another 2 hour pass (not worth it). the time is well monitored from your key card (pocket in sleeve of rental clothes) every time you enter the lift area to load. so not to worry about keeping track.

There is also a cafe half way up the slope where you can stop off for a hot chocolate !"

Had a few slides, but if you've skied on real slopes, the Ski Dubai experience felt just what it was, sliding down icy hallway. Not even close to the right thing, sorry to say. The only good thing was, there wasn't any queues, which made me think all the other people made better choises spending their time somewhere else.

All the equipment is provided except hats and gloves, best thing is to plan ahead and take them anyway even if you end up not wearing them later. My advice would also be take a pair of decent socks, they provide some disposable socks with all the gear but they are a little thin. The chair lift takes a while but this was the only method of getting up the slope when we went along. The surface is pretty compact and a bit icy in places so certainly not a place to learn to ski although we did see some people clearly not experienced but nevertheless having a great time."

Kit provided is a bit basic to say the least if you are a proficient skier.(I spend 6 months of the year in the Alps so ski LOADS). but hey it was OK. There is a 400 metre slope with a \"dog leg\" halfway down. Some Boxes for the more adventurous near the top. There is a 4 man chair and a drag(poma) lift. The drag is actually quicker for getting up provided not too many novicies fall off & get in your way! They use the chair for non skiers to access the toboggan run so it runs slow, but it is nice to chat to other visitors. A small cafe at the half way stage, nice touch so anyone never been skiing can get a bit of an idea what it might be like in the mountains. There is also a large \"play area\" for non skiers to experiance some of the fun of snow! Small toboggan run, slides, big ball to roll down the hill in and of course you can always have a snowball fight!! Just to say you skied in the desert on \"real\" snow is a novel thing."

You do receive a jacket and pants, but they are not meant for heat retention. Luckily there is a mid-run ski chalet where you can warm up with a good hot chocolate.Lots of fun if you take it for the experience!"

Also, we did not have to pay for a locker-- well, we did, but our money was refunded once we returned our keys when we left.This is definitely not a place for high quality, intense skiing... but if you consider you are in the middle of the desert and recognize the irony of snow skiing in the morning and playing in the desert sand in the evening, it's a fun memory."

            "review": "Super Cool!. My sister-in-law surprised the three of us (22 year old daughter, husband and me) with a two-hour pass to go skiing at \"Ski Dubai.\" What! How Bizarre! We were there on a Saturday afternoon, and the whole process was so easy. Firstly, you go to a counter where they give you a ski jacket, pants and socks. Then you go to a counter where they give you ski boots. Then you put on your ski suit and one boot and give the other to the guy who fits your boot to the skis. Now you have everything, except your ski poles (complimentary helmets are also available). The pass card goes in a pocket on your jacket, so when you approach the electronic turnstyle it allows you to enter. So you go up the escalator and collect your ski poles at the top, and then you enter the most surreal atmosphere you could expect in Dubai, or pretty much anywhere! It really is like a mini ski resort! There is a 4-main chair lift and a button drag lift. Being lazy, we took the chair lift, but our daughter tried the button lift, and we found it was faster to the top than the chair. At the top, there are two runs. One is a little steeper and even has a couple of tiny moguls! The air is very cold, and the snow is not bad at all. We have a cabin in a ski resort, so I think we are fair judges when it comes to this. There are a few \"planks\" on one side of the run for boarders to practice their tricks, and there's also a toboggan run, but it seemed to be closed. We skied for an hour and had one of the best experiences we've had in Dubai. One tip: bring gloves, because they are not included in your ski gear, and your hands get very, very cold! You can also buy them in a shop there. If you are not a skier, or if you have small children with you, there is also a snow park to slide around. I highly recommend \"Ski Dubai\" as a fun diversion from the beach and shopping."

Anyway....I went for a lesson along with a friend who is an experienced snow boarder (he just bought a ski pass). I was booked in around 4pm, you are advised to show up an hour early for the lesson to get your equipment together. This might sound excessive but on the day we were there, the queues were insane! It took the full hour to get my gear, which then turned out to be the wrong size but too late to change it as the lesson was starting. The whole place was a mess, equipment dumped everywhere, staff were unfriendly (so would I be if I was working there on that day, to be fair), no place to sit as it was so crowded, kids running around everywhere etc....I actually ditched the lesson as I was totally stressed and over it by that point. I just went out to the slope to watch people snowboarding/skiing instead.I think the moral of this story is to go early in the day as possible unless you have a fondness for queues and chaos. As for the slope itself, my friend described it as boring after 2 runs. Although it is nice being somewhere cold in such a hot climate, I'm also not too sure how sensible this place is in terms of energy usage.I guess if snow inside a mall sounds appealing as a novelty, or if you want to practice before a holiday, it might be worth a visit but personally I would give it a miss and wait for the real thing."

Since they were oblivious to the allure of shopping, we decided to enroll them in skiing lessons. It turned out to be the best decision ever. The kids absolutely loved it. There are different levels of lessons to choose from Discovery, Beginner, Intermediate 1,2 etc. The levels are recommended based on your child's skill level. Each level has a set of exercises to learn. Once is child is able to all the exercises in a level, they can move onto the next, (either the same day or the next, we chose the next day). Their prowess is recorded in \"passports\" which are given to them. The instructors are from different parts of the world, fabulous skiers and very child friendly. The groups are kept small and instructions are very clear. Do book the lessons in advance. It saves a lot of time when you get there if your child's details are already keyed in. Instructors vary from lesson to lesson.So if your child's first instructor has specified that your child requires attention in a certain area, do request them to write that down while they are signing off their passports. And do show this to the next instructor prior to their second lesson. And do carry your passports to all lessons. It is a good idea to be there ahead of time to allow for the time it takes to get their gear ready. My children cleared several levels and since Ski Dubai is in one of the best malls, one can get some shopping done in the meantime without having to drag unwilling children around. For those interested snow boarding lessons are also offered, both for adults as well as children. It's money well spent."

Gloves and hats are necessary while wearing clothes in addition to your tank top and shorts will make your stay there more comfortable.About tobogganing, a couple of adults had their knees and elbows bumped into the ice shafts during the run, quite dangerous according to them as no one told them what posture was appropriate.The giant ball was fun but it was charged at 30 dirhsms for each ride or needed an upgrade from the basic ticket (80 dirhams) to gain unlimited access to the chairlift, giant ball and tobogganing down the slope.Not at all amazing but it did make the trip to Dubai fun... sand, water & snow!!!!"

I thought it was an enjoyable way to spend a few hours and it was a great escape from the heat of the Dubai afternoon. I went on a Thursday and the number of skiers on the slope was comfortable. (It can get quite crowded on Fridays and Saturdays.)Entrance cost was about $50USD for a two hour ski pass. (Note: The Entertainer Book has buy one, get one free coupons.) The cost includes all necessary equipment and ski pants and jacket. It does not include gloves though. (Gloves are available for purchase near the entry way.) Lockers are available for a nominal fee.The skiing was pretty basic, however since I hadn't skied for about five years it took a few runs for me to get used to it again. I would have liked to have \"practiced\" on the \"bunny slope\" first, however only those taking lessons have access to it. It's a great time for the intermediate skier. If you're a really good skier, you may get bored going down the same run over and over... however it feels great to be in the cool air no matter what your experience level is.Additional Notes: The snow park portion is a separate ticket. A day pass for the ski slope is also available"

The idea of skiing in the middle of the desert seemed so bizarre that I had to do it. Truth be told I was a bit bored, and was not all that impressed. It's the skiing equivalent of an indoor ice skating rink. The only problem is you can go from the top to the bottom in a couple of minutes. After going up and down twice you're pretty much ready to leave. If you've never skied or boarded before, then it would probably be more fun. The problem is skiing is an outdoor sport where half the fun comes from exploring different terrains. I was more impressed by the aquarium at the Dubai Mall. Scuba diving there gives you a chance to get up close with a high concentration of fish, which would rarely happen out in the ocean.Come to Ski Dubai to at least see it. If you decided to give it a go, don't plan on staying there too long."

Myself and father (who have never been on the slopes before) decided to have a very beginner lesson (called a 'Discovery' session). We booked and used a 20% off discount voucher that we got from our hotels check-in desk. On the day of our Ski we bought gloves from the small ski store right next to the ticket desks. The gloves were very good value and the only thing we needed to buy as the Skis, Coat, Trousers and disposable socks where all included in the hire price of the lesson. The only part of the experience that didn't seem overly organised was the equipment hire and waiting for the tutor, at there were no instructions or help available and very few staff around.We got our locker and got ready for the slopes.After a short wait our tutor got our small group of about 7 together and took us through to the slope.The 60 min session went quickly but was in no way rushed. The tuition was fantastic and of a very high standard. The group moved along very quickly and were perfectly pushed and encouraged by the tutor. By the end of the first lesson we were all moving down the mid slope unaided with only a few falls.A great experience and well worth the money. We thought the value was excellent (much better than in the UK!).We look forward to going back and doing the next course (beginner) to learn even more from the great experienced team at Ski Dubai"

There were LOTS of people on the slopes who obviously coudn't ski - making it very dangerouse for everyone else. It was all very tired looking and a bit grubby and there were only 2 slopes (not sure what I was expecting!). On the plus side - it was well organised, they lend you everything apart from gloves and there is a lovely little cafe half way down which does great hot chocolate with marshmallows.

Ski Dubai is located in the Mall of the Emirates, right next to the Kempinski Hotel. This is also a Metro stop. And you have to visit Ski Dubai to know what I mean. A complete section of the mall is converted into this giant ski and snow park area which is many stories high. There are basically three type of entries for the full day: one for the basic snow park, two for partial entry on the ski slope and third full access. Rates vary as per. It is advisable to wear pants and a full hands T shirt, but they will also will be providing protective clothing and boots with complementary socks. Kids are made to wear helmets as well. Also please carry your own gloves and snow cap, or else you will have to buy in their shop, as they don't provide those.Inside the snow park near the entry there will be a photographer from kodak ready to take your pix whose purchase is optional but very expensive. And then its all fun inside. I enjoyed it more so as I come from a hot country and frankly have never played in artificial snow with my young daughter before this. She was thrilled. We spent a good three hours inside the snow park area on the slides and the tyres, etc. You can carry your mobile phones inside but there is no network. Also you can carry your own cameras but there are no pockets on the outfits provided so keeping the camera is problematic. There is a separate viewing area for spectators and snaps can be clicked from there as well. And they do have a locker facility which is chargeable, so keep all your valuables or purchases in the car before entering ski Dubai. Kids below three years not allowed.I totally loved this novel attraction and would definitely recommend it to all just for the kicks."

Ski Dubai is a fantastic, surreal and larger than life experience.We visited early morning, booking a 'Discovery lesson' at 10am on a weekday. We arrived at 9.15am as suggested, changing into boots, outerwear and skis as provided (bring your own gloves and hat).We were lucky as the lesson was empty and it ended up just being the two of us, therefore receiving a private lesson for the price of a group lesson.The instructor, Nina, was fantastic- patient, encouraging and very helpful- by the end if the hour we could both ski down the smaller slopes at speed, stop etc... A really fun experience, something I doubt one would be able to experience any where else.One thing annoyed us- there are guys who take your photos inside, ski-ing, on the travelator etc this is all harmless fun and doesn't get in the way- however, when it comes to the option of purchasing- they wanted UK\u00a380 to purchase a CD of 40 photos!!!! It makes all the posing for photos a complete waste of time! Take in your iPhone or slim camera instead and snap away / video yourself etc works a treat to get a couple of souvenir snaps.Overall- an absolutely fantastic experience.

It is definitely great fun for the whole family, I was under a great impression of how big the premises are. There are 2 lifts, one intended for intermediate skiiers and another one for advanced users. The slope is not challenging, but there are areas where you can really get yourself going fast so beware. Included in the price (2 hours are included in the preliminary charge) are a set of skis, and a winter outfit, but remember to take your own gloves, cause you can't rent gloves and the one in the shop adjacent to the site are pretty expensive. Even if you can't ski there is a winter park where people who have never experienced snow can play and slide on rafts. All in all it was a wonderful experience and when I visit Dubai again I will certainly go skiing again!"

Only concern was that I was twice hit by out of control locals who could barely ski and were going at speeds way above their ability levels. Didn't see anyone pulling these sort of skiers to one side and telling them to slow down. Use the Entertainer voucher to get two for one to make it more economic. A two hour session (more than enough on the one slope) was 180 Dihrams but you pay extra for a locker so budget on 200."

Whilst this might not sound like a big issue, it makes the ride up the slopes very slow (eight mins) and consequently the cold sets in very quickly. There is a drag lift up the side of the \"experts\" slope which is much faster but this is not always operational. I was told the drag is used when the slope is busy but I couldn't not find out exactly when the drag does operate, so it is probably a cost saving tactic. Also the expert run is closed for events some evenings. Disappointing for experienced skiers, so check before you set out."

The hot chocolate at the mid-slope Avalanche Cafe is highly recommended.One noticeable change since our last visit was the increase in non-skiiers just going up and down on the chairlift for the novelty value. It's certainly an experience seeing people pass you on a ski lift in full Emirati dress however the constant slowing down of the lift to let them on is a bit of a nuisance if you've paid to ski. It crawls along and really cuts your time on the slope down. I would recommend going at 10am when the slope opens. It's much quieter then."

I pre-booked and took my children for a skiing lesson. We were advised to get there 45 minutes ahead of the lesson to collect all the gear, get fitted for skis etc. We needed every minute of the 45 minutes as the outfitting area was chaotic, to say the least. A major issue was that the staff behind the counter would guess the size of the person in front of the counter, and then would have to go all the way to the back of the store area to collect gear. Customers were then sent off to change. There appeared to be no designated area for people to come back to if the gear didn't fit, so we had people pushing into queues through the exit gates trying to exchange their outfits for different sizes. We also experienced large families lining up, but apparently having no idea what size everyone was; it took one family in front of us 25 minutes to get outfitted. All in all, simply getting the kids outfitted and to the lesson meeting point in time was a very stressful experience.To make matters worse, the children (sensible kids aged 11 and 13) didn't enjoy their lesson because they said the instructor was surly and unhelpful. I would recommend this as a novelty experience if you can already ski, but not as a way of introducing your kids to skiing. It's more fun to watch from the comfort of the St Moritz cafe."

Ski Dubai is at the end of Mall of the Emirates so there are lots of shops, food stops, etc to see if some of the family don't want to ski. Check out the website first since it is made quite clear that the main slopes are only for people who won't put others at risk or spoil the enjoyment of others. Before I paid, the cashier asked me several questions and warned me that if I wasn't good enough (I had skied once before on a dry ski slope) I may be prevented from skiing and be required to undertake lessons (which may need to be pre-booked. Everything was fair and clear. The staff were excellent and advised upon correct skis and boot fitting. The equipment was in good condition and everything was included in the price (UAE Dhs 210 - \u00a330)(you get Dhs 10 back at the end when returning the electronic key). Being very cautious about not getting ejected or causing a hazard, I started on the upper nursery slope and gained confidence again in snow ploughing. After 4 or 5 attempts, I moved up to the lower section of the main slope (this is when the timer started) and did the same, getting faster and practicing turns and stopping. Finally, I progressed to the top (which splits in two for more experienced and less experienced skiers). The first couple of runs were gradual and again I was able to build up confidence and skill - the ticket was for 2 hours, but my electronic tag gave me three hours for some reason - this was more than enough as I actually skied for about 2. The timer only starts once you use the ski-lift so all the nursery slope practice (which uses a conveyor belt) didn't start the clock running (useful!!!).I went at about 8pm on a Wednesday and ended at 11pm. For the whole of this time, the place was not busy and by the last hour, I sometimes had the whole piste to myself - excellent for practicing and using the whole slope. I didn't use the most advanced section at all - It is clearly for more experienced skiers - one of my work colleagues seriously broke his collar bone by going on the steep slope first on a previous visit!!Considering the infrastructure and quality of everything, this was excellent value for money. I returned on Thursday night, but noted it was much busier and decided not to use the ski facility (remember Friday and Saturday are the main days off work for most Arabic countries). There were lots of helpful staff on hand and I had no complaints - quite the opposite - as a novice skier, this was a perfect introduction and well worth it.The place was a very comfortable -2 degrees and with no wind, I wore just a T-shirt and trousers under the ski equipment provided (they even give you socks) - I didn't need gloves or a hat (but being from the UK I am used to the cold).It was so nice to get out of the heat outside and on the previous 2 nights I had gone to the Ice rink at the Dubai Mall - again well worth a visit!!!"

There's an indoor viewing platform so you can have a look to see what it's all about... We just turned up, and then found out that if you couldn't ski (none of us could), you weren't allowed on the slopes until you'd had a competence lesson (180 AED) which lasted two hours - and had to be pre-booked. The only area we could go in was the kids slopes/playground - and with three teenagers that wasn't going to happen. If we had realised prior to going, that we needed to have a lesson first, we would have pre-booked and then gone back later in the week to enjoy the slopes. Also, check the times - you can't go onto the slopes until after 2pm."

I took my son (3) and daughter (5) to the Ski centre at the end of the very large Mall of the Emirates. Unfortunately, we didn't get to the mall until quite late in the evening and managed to get 2 hours of sledging and taboganning in - we paid nearly \u00a325 per person for the privilege though. And that's the problem I have with this place- if your kids can Ski, then you can vary the activities, on the other hand, my two were soon bored (as was I) of sitting in the inflatable rings to slide down a rather short slope..again and again and again. The taboggan run was the other option but this is not particularly suitable for young kids unless you want to suffer cuts and bruises. From a service perspective all areas were staffed with people who were very polite and helpful. The one problem I had was that I couldn't find a helmet ssuitable for a small child and none of the staff were in that area were particularly helpful in finding the right one. This was the only downside in the service - which may have been due to the lateness of our visit."

We really didn't know how hard the hill was going to be. Where I live, we have multiple world class ski hills within a 2 hours drive, so we know the experience at Ski Dubai is just going to be strictly novelty. When we showed up, we paid our 180 AED each and that got us suited up with ski pants, ski jacket (it was a button up ski jacket, I can't say I've ever worn a button up ski jacket before), boots and skis (or snowboard for the boarders). The 180 AED gave us 2 hours of ski time and we're able to freeze the time if we decide to grab some food during the experience.I liked the fact that there were a lot of lockers to put our stuff in, and the facilities were very clean. Going up the escalator with ski boots on was an experience, and they had a wide variety of ski poles to choose from which was good.We get into the hill after going through the revolving door and it was a perfect -2C, just like home on a good ski day. Right away we see the kids on the left with their inner tubes flying arond at the bottom of the hill (it's closed off for kids with helmets), and we decided to head to the ski lift. The whole run lasts about 5 minutes if you go all the way to the top, and it's basically a big Green Run experience. The expert section of the hill is a Green run that is slightly narrower than the regular section. The skills section of the hill was closed unfortunately so we couldn't try the rails and the jumps.We ended up skiing for about 90 minutes until we had enough, there was only so much we can handle before it just got redundant. For those who have never skied or snowboard before, this would be a perfect hill to learn on. When we went there were next to nobody there. At all times there were maybe 20 people on the hill at one time so there were a lot of space. For experienced skiers and snowboarders, it's fun and enjoyable, and the fact that you're skiing/snowboarding in a desert is pretty cool itself. But it got old after 90 minutes for us. Either way, it was pretty fun nonetheless."

I\u2019ve never had a problem with dirty or smelly trousers or jackets as some reviewers have mentioned. I love the fact that when I start to feel the cold I can take comfort from the fact I'll be walking out of there back into hot sunshine.They claim to have the world\u2019s only indoor black run but that\u2019s an exaggeration, however, we are experienced skiers and find it very enjoyable. There is a magic carpet for beginners and that section is separated from the main slopes so beginners are more comfortable.Like a real slope there are sometimes out of control teenage snowboarders flying around and my one criticism is that staff make no efforts to keep them in check.One of the cutest things to see is grown men in dishdashas (the national dress) playing around in the snow park when they are probably experiencing snow for the first time, makes me smile every time."

For the price, everything is included \u2013 lift ticket, ski rental, outer clothes. The only thing not included is your hat and gloves to keep warm. You can purchase them at the local ski shop or just outside Ski Dubai at the H&M store. I would also recommend you take a pair of heavy, knee-high socks.

Ski Dubai is an engineering marvel and definitely something you should try out!The ski area is quite large and offers a number of slopes of varying difficulty. The temperature inside is quite cold so I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND GETTING GLOVES AND A CAP. If you haven't skied in a while, or never at all, I definetly recommend the Beginners Tutorial, but novice skiers should be able to handle the basic slopes without instruction. More experienced skiers will probably jump straight to the Black Slope that's 400 meters long and starts 25 stories up.It may seem a bit costly, but keep in mind that Jacket, Pants, Boots, Optional helmet, and Ski's are all included in the price. Also you'll get 10 AED back when you return your ski pass cards when you leave.Overall we had loads of fun and may even go back to get a few more hours of skiing in before we leave Dubai!"

The plan was he would go for a meeting, and me and my 2 kids ( age 2 & 7 ) will spend the day in Ski Dubai. Sounds great, right. I tried to prepare everything, read people's reviews. From which I learned that we need to bring hats and mittens, and it's best to go around 10am, just after they open, to avoid crowds. But turned out, I missed 1 thing. Kids under 2 can't enter the place. It became a huge problem for me since I have to come with my 7 years old son, since kids under 13 has to go with an adult. They suggested me to send my 2 years old daughter to a daycare called Pick a Boo ( level 2, inside Magic Planet ). I went there, paid the fee, and only after that they told me that kids under 3 has to go with an adult. OMG!! After I negotiated, they arranged a nanny for my daughter with AED50/hour extra. So the first hour, I paid AED85, the next hour AED60. After all that, finally we enter the snow park. One funny thing, it's a must to wear helmets for kids. But, the helmets are so small, that it wont fit if your kid's wearing a hat. It's like a mushroom on my son's head. Meaning it just there, not protecting anything. The snow park is not as big as I thought, but it's enough to introduce my son to snow. And he enjoyed it a lot."

We waited in huge lines (it was February 2008) to get our ski suits and boots; the suits and boots were disgusting! I doubt they are ever cleaned because they were still moist from the last people wearing them. By the way, you have to purchase your own gloves and hats if you want them. My husband and his friend decided once we had already purchased the tickets that they weren't going to go snowboarding; they were not impressed. I took our son through the \"snow park\" while they waited in the mall. I was so not impressed! There wasn't snow unless you call the hard packed gray stuff under our feet as such! My son rode on the little tube \"ride\" 2 times and he was done. There's really nothing for kids to do there; he had to be 7 for snowboarding (which is why we went there) and he was too old to take the 1st classes for skiing. They offer sleds for kids but the parents obviously are not watching how there kids act with them because my son was knocked down a few times by kids whipping them around. Inside the \"snow park\" you can climb up a spiral staircase to get to a bridge so you can watch the skiers come down the hill. These are dangerous!!! The treads are very narrow and they're metal with no traction so my son almost fell half way down them (thankfully I grab a hold of the back of his suit). Since there was nothing to do we only stayed inside the park for half an hour or so. It was so not work the money we spent! We will never go back! I think if you've never seen snow you might enjoy this but after winters in Ohio and Oregon this was not worth it."

In Snow park, you have an unlimited time in the park, but once you get out, you can't enter anymore. In slope, you pay for 2 hours with additional charges for each incremental hour after. Both entrance options come with jackets, helmets for kids under 13 years old, boots, socks and equipments.Snowpark: It's very good and clean, with different games to play (bobsled, tobogganing, etc). it's perfect for non-skiers/boarders and for children. They love running around the park and it's perfectly clean and safe.Slope: They have different levels of slope, but the beginner's level is a bit higher than what you'd find in regular ski slope. The only drawback to this is, you can only do slope if you can ski/snowboard. If you want to do self-discovery, you have to take the lessons, you can't do it yourself. If you fall too often, they have the rights to remove you from the slope. So it is perfect for intermediate and expert skiers/boarders, and perfect for beginners who want to take lessons. Either way, it is by far the best and biggest snow park I've been to. Tip: if you purchase slopes entrance and locker space, save the keycards, cause you get 10 durhams for each keycard back if you return them. Pretty cool huh?"

Naturally I was skeptical but could not resist the novelty of the idea. So a short taxi cab ride brought me to the Mall of the Emirtes and I was standing before a ski lift gazing up the slope about 15 minutes later. The cost of admission provides everything you need except a hat and gloves (which you do need by the way). There was almost no crowd at all so I was able to ride to the top and ski down about once every 6 minutes. The run was short but the experience was great, I enjoyed every second of my 2 hour pass and managed about 18 runs. It left me longing for the slopes of home but for a few hours diversion in Dubai you can't beat it. Take a friend and sit by the fire afterwards, if you close your eyes it find of feels like Colorado."

It costs 115 Dirhams to get a ski pass, 10 of which is refundable at the end when you feed the pass back into a machine.The rental equipment is not the best, the boots are cheap and the skis are pretty basic. You also get a jacket and salopets (that go over your trousers/shorts) and a locker to put your stuff in. The locker works off the ski pass so don't loose it! You also need the ski pass to get on the lift inside, it has a chip in it and there is a place in the arm of your jacket where it goes. You do not get gloves or a hat so if you planning on going bring your own (don't need the hat in my opinion). I am sure you can buy them there as the place is in the middle of a massive shopping mall!There is not much carrying of skis as there is an escalator that takes you up to the entrance where you pick up your poles. Tip. Check the size of your poles as people just return them to any old slot and all because the big label states 115 cms does not mean that they will be that length, someone could have dumped 125 cms in there.The actual slope is about 400 meters long and turns a dog leg. There is an easy side and a harder side.I haven\u2019t skied on artificial snow before and didn\u2019t really like it. There is a mist that hangs over the place and the visibility is not the best. If you have skied before you will get bored very soon.The ski lift is sooo slow. It takes ages to get up. There is a half way point where you can get off before it turns the dog leg.For a new place it is already looking a little tired and I suspect they have a few problems.On the plus side it was pretty empty.

Not enough sledges, several parts closed etc etc.I'm sure things will improve with time and I'll visit again. Just dont expect a well-run attraction just yet..."
