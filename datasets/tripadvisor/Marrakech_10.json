We stopped here on our way to see the waterfalls further up the valley. And had a very interesting and excellent stop at this small museum. It's a restored traditional family home with the guide giving many insights into the traditions and lifestyle of the Berber people. Berber people have many traditions and the symbolism and story telling within carpet designs was particularly interesting. They are also good engineers, with some very interesting tools and work methods. A great stop and ticket money and donations benefit the community too which is nice. Well worth an hour of your time."

It seems that there is a confusion between 2 museums here on Tripadvisor, the Mus\u00e9e Berb\u00e8re in Jardins Majorelle, and the ECOMUS'EE BERBERE in the small village og Tafza in the Ourika Valley. I am talking about the second one, in the Ourika Valley, 35 km from Marrakech.It is a must on the way to Ourika, probably the worthiest place to visit in the valley. Don't miss the sign in a bend of the road, drive up to the mosk and walk from there (the signs are not very visible). The inhabitants have collected all kind of artefacts related to all aspects of the life in the Berber homes and rebuilt the caid house of the village to host the collection. The museum is very informative, the guide (SAlah ) is simply driven by passion, and the artefacts are very interesting, seldom shown together. A lot of photos, maps and explanations are definitely worth looking for this little but complete museum."

Khalid who looks after the museum, will guide you around the collection of Berber artefacts, so that each object is brought to life. You will find on display a range of carpets, ceramics, jewellery as well as everyday items and tools used by the local Berber families. This museum is linked to the Photography Mueum in Marrakech, and so a collection of 1920\u2019s \u2013 1930\u2019s photographs of \u201ctravellers in Morooco\u201d is also on display.

This is a real authentic experience without stoping at any touristy shops along the way\u2026 we used public transport to get to our destination (with the help of our guide), when we arrived we did a gentle three hour hike in the beautiful valley, explored a few villages and a salt mine, then we ate a delicious lunch at our guide Khalid's house - lovely home, amazing food and amazing people! We then toured the Ecomusee Berbere - a great informative museum housed in a renovated Kasbah. Khalid was with us the whole time and was super informative and passionate about the Berber culture, the surrounding nature, his people, etc. This is the real deal - this is not a typical tourist trip.. if you are looking for an authentic Berber experience, ditch the tourist groups (you will see tours advertised in Marrakech at travel agencies, restaurants, and your accommodation), head to the Photography Museum and book a tour with Khalid. I couldn't recommend it more."

Our only complaint was that a second guy showed up after our fantastic docent had finished his tour and started throwing his weight around, saying that he was the one really in charge, that despite the fact that it clearly says shared entry for the photography and ecomusee, that we had to pay again, the books were wrong, blah blah blah. Obviously trying to make money on the side for himself. A totally disagreeable man. The docent was charming, however, and the ecomusee is more than worth the duck in, if you can avoid the overseer."

The owner's nephew was an engaging guide to daily life in this clan, instructing us in the iconography and colours used in the woven rugs, the working of a Berber door lock and a drill, and the various other tools and artworks they so ingeniously created. We left with a real sense of the culture, not least because of his lively and informed approach. The only sadness is the poverty you see in the village. I have no idea how involved the people are in the Ecomuseum, but I can only hope that the interest and revenue it produces somehow feeds back into their lives."

Khalid will customize the tour for each group, visiting neighboring villages, the orchards and farms in the valley, a walk to the river, and even a stop for a camel ride. The guide is very engaging and will let you know what it is like to live as a Berber.

When I couldn't keep on standing and listening, the guide put me outside on a little stool. I enjoyed myself watching life in the hamlet around the museum, and greeting the locals going to and from the communal bath. They live in, what we would call, pure poverty, with just ditches instead of paths, with a Frisian cow on a rope attached to a tree but absolutely nothing to graze around her but pure dust and sand, lots of chickens not finding anything to eat either but still, seemingly, enjoying themselves and roosters behaving as super macho's. But life, here, is lived to the fullest, and there is dignity in all those I saw passing by. We were pleased to have visited this museum.It is situated outside Marrakesh, in the Ourika Valley. Entrance fees are small, children free."
