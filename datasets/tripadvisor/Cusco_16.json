My only suggestion is during the Machu Picchu Tour, make sure you tell your tour guide if you want to go to the Puerta del Sol...we had to inform our guide, and thank God we did cause we would have missed it, since it was not on his agenda, and trust me it is the best location for you to take pictures and enjoy the majestic beauty of Machu Picchu!"

We were offered a lot of alcohol that really wasn't needed but we had obviously paid for it in our ticket. The food was good but not exceptional. The musical entertainment was great fun. But it soon became dark and we just wanted to arrive at our destination. I am sure that it was due to my mood that the experience didn't 'tick all the boxes'"

            "review": "Pretty great experience except for the problem we experienced.. The pre-boarding experience with entertainment and champagne in Puroy lived up to the Orient Express experience(I still don't know why they changed the name to Belmond). We were seated at a nice large table on the right side of the train and the adventure started. Drinks could be had at the table or the observation car, which was the next car. View were spectacular following the river A four course meal along with wine was served and the morning meal was incredible. Food was very nice. We were told we would have the same table on the return journey at the end of the day and that is were the problem began.Machu Pichu was as incredible as I hoped it would be. Our guide Angela was accommodating to customers who could not make the climb up the stays and came runnig back to join us. Nice to see it even took a toll on younger people. They take you from the train to Machu Pichu on a bus and offer a guided tour. Afterwards you have a nice tea with a lot of food and beverages at the Belmond hotel that is at the gates to Machu Pichu. You take the bus back and are again entertained while waiting to board and saved champagne. We were escorted to our seats and to my dismay we were switched to a smaller table on the other ride of the train. I was very upset. Apparently part of the problems was my partners ticket had him sitting at anther table. This is weird as we purchased our tickets 8 months earlier paying full price and you think someone would have noticed. I let them no how upset I was and it totally influenced the journey home. As it is dark on the journey we did not miss much interns of view but the table was definitely not as nice and I did not enjoy the food or service as much. The train was much more crowded so staff was pretty busy keeping up. They tried giving us an amenity gift at the end with things like a pen which was gesture but I was still upset. When I got to the hotel and told the concierge what happened he was upset also. He asked me to hold off on my review. He had worked for the Hiram Bingham and contacted the manger of the train service to let him know about this. The two of them met with me in my room the next day and we had a nice talk were I accepted the sincerity of the apology and believe they will try and prevent something like this from happening again. The problem had been we had been assured we would have the same table on the way back and they should have known that was not the case. After the talk and a dinner offer I realized it really was a magical experience I should not let it effect my review. I did let them know I would write about so people who read this would be sure it does not happen to them."

Everything is included in this trip even your tickets to Macchu Picchu, the bus ride to the entrance, tour guide and a buffet tea before you return back to the train on the bus. As amazing as the train ride, service and food was, the unexpected treasure was our tour guide, Nick. He completely took care of us. His talent as a story teller and passion for his subject made for a delightful learning experience. He calmed our nerves over our height anxiety. Our budget did not allow for a round trip on the Hiram Bingham. We booked the Vista dome for the ride back. Nick knew our scheduled return and he packed our time, covering the entire area and getting us back in time for the tea buffet that was included in the Hiram Bingham trip. What I thought was a splurge was the best value for making the most out of our visit."

We rode the train to and from Machu Picchu and it was worth every penny. I felt that I was stepping back in time as we boarded the train. The food was excellent and the staff was first class. The party in the bar car was fantastic for people of all ages! I was concerned about the dress code for the train prior to going because I worried that our attire for trekking the ruins would be too casual, but it was fine. Most people on the train were dressed the same way and the atmosphere very beautiful and casual at the same time."

The locomotive is at the Machu Picchu side of the train, followed by the kitchen car, then 2 dining cars and 1 bar/lounge car with an open platform on the back. The train takes 3.5 hours to do 90 km, so it's not mind-blowingly fast, and a main attraction is to stand on the back platform with the breeze in your hair and your pisco sour in your hand, waving to villagers as you pass them. At one point going into a canyon, the train does switchbacks, meaning that switches have to be thrown at the front and back of the train--interesting to watch.On the way BACK, the locomotive is on the Cuzco side, but the rest of the train has not been turned. So the locomotive is right in front of the bar car, and the platform doors are locked to prevent the diesel exhaust from wafting through the train. Not that there's much to see anyway, since it gets dark soon after the train leaves.There's of course food and alcohol, the lovely polished wood and brass fittings of the 1920 carriages, and the ability to pretend that you're part of history. It's a bit reminiscent of the Blue Train in South Africa, but not quite as good because the tracks are really badly maintained, so the train lurches quite a bit. Many other trains use this track since MP is not otherwise accessible. The Vistadome trains looked quite comfortable and I'm sure they were much cheaper, but despite the high price (USD 380/direction) I was very happy to have taken the HB."

Machu Pichu had been on my bucket list for a long time but it appeared to be such a difficult place to get to and staying at Belmond Rio Sagrado, taking the Hiram Bingham and spending one night at Belmond Sanctuary made everything so easy and wonderful.Our train ride was very nice we had preferred seating I suspect due to our guests at the hotel as well. Everything was so beautiful, the live band and the views were the special highlights. On the way going we did not get seats in the bar carriage therefore on our return trip we made sure to secure seats. The service is immaculate, food is good but not great. Together with the tour at Machu Pichu, I feel the price is fair for what you get, especially considering the difficulties in this terrain to provide anything five star!"

We were staying at the Belmond Monasterio in Cusco so went from luxury to luxury. The morning train included a band that very quickly had the patrons dancing, singing and enjoying Pisco Sours. The 3 1/2 hour ride went quickly and included an outstanding brunch in the morning. We returned the following day and again had an excellent dinner in the evening which again was highlighted by the band and more pisco sours. The train is expensive but worth every penny. I would also recommend staying at the Belmond Sanctuary as the location at the entrance gates to Manchu Picchu is worth another big expense."

            "review": "A Great End To Our Machu Picchu Adventure. Our family did the 4-day Inca Trail trek in June, staying at Belmond properties at either end of the trip (Nazarenas in Cusco before the hike, then the Sanctuary at Macchu Picchu after the hike, returning to the Nazarenas the next day) and Belmond made the transfers seamless, making sure our luggage made it up to Machu Picchu's Sanctuary Lodge for our dirty, tired arrival there and onto the Hiram Bingham for our journey back to Cusco. We were a little concerned about having so much luggage on the train because we had read that you are only allowed a small bag, but apparently there's an exception made for people who do the trek (and it probably helps to stay at a Belmond property) because no one made an issue of it at all. Our wardrobe for this trip was extremely casual so I was a little concerned about the Hiram Bingham being too fancy for our hiker-friendly dress code (my nicest shoes were my Keen sandals) but it wasn't an issue at all, most of the passengers were wearing casual attire. Our kids (ages 8 and 15) were so excited to ride an old-style train and the fine dining on board was a real treat for them (and us). Afterward, my husband and I had drinks and all four of us really enjoyed the live music. It was kind of a surreal experience listening to a Peruvian band rock out to the Stones' \"I Can't Get No Satisfaction\" in a train car rumbling down the Peruvian Andes.Overall, a great end to our Machu Picchu trip. If we hadn't done the hike, I would've loved to take the Hiram Bingham up the mountain, because the views were probably great during the day, but we didn't mind not having any views at night, as our previous 5 days had been full of them during the trek and the subsequent stay at the Sanctuary."

We were then taken down the mountain in a bus and escorted to the check-in lobby where bubbly was served. Dinner was magnificent, with every detail thought out. The wine list is also excellent. Although quite expensive it is a once in a lifetime trip, and worth the experience if it is within your budget. The band was great fun, and we loved the Peruvian drum. You just need to remember to visit the bar carriage in between courses so that you can make the most of the band."

A great Pullman that matches our other trips on Orient Express trains ( such a better Brand equity than the made-up Belmond Brand ) however , it can be shorter than usual ( stopping at Ollytetambo rather than Puroy ) if you happen to be travelling during one of numerous strikes that afflict this country. I know when these things happen it is no fault of the owners , but when you pay such a high price to get on board it really leaves you feeling short changed to only go 50% of the way and then finish your luxurious experience in a tourist bus for 1hour 45 minutes rattling your way to Cusco in the dark ! As for getting a discount when such incidents occur you would have thought there was a well documented process led by the operator to ensure the pain is softened but unfortunately you have to do most of the legwork here- we think we have secured a 25% refund but have yet to see the money back in our account! The experience itself is well documented and the staff led by Andy - the train manager are a fantastic , enthusiastic team who pull out all the stops to make it special , whatever the circumstances We thought the food was at the right level for such a short journey and the bar experience with the local band makes it all a bit more fun ( especially if you have some Aussies on board who just love a singalong )All in all to be recommend as a great way to get back from MP"

Too high it seems.The service on the train was good but there were a number of major issues.The train was only 2/3 full and we were all invited to the bar for the entertainment. But there were only seats for half the people. After a long day wondering the ruins and a now bumpy train ride a seat was required. Thus we missed out on the entertainment. In the bar we noticed the mosquitos, many of them dancing around the lights. When we returned to out table they seemed to have followed up. By the end of dinner there were about 10 dead ones on my white tablecloth. At least they had a means of dealing with them but after spending days covered in DEET trying not to get bitten we thought we would be safe on the train.And then there was the food. We had eaten in a number of Belmond Hotels on this trip and expected a similar standard of food, particularly after the above mentioned afternoon tea. The food was ok not nothing special and not up to the hotel standards. Yes we were on a train but we expected more given the cost and the publicity about the train."

The whole package is superb, we traveled both ways on the Hiram Bingham train and felt all aspects of the trip were perfect and well worth the additional cost.On arrival at Poroy station we were greeted with champagne on the station platform and Peruvian musicians and dancers performed for us. After this we were shown to our seats in the restaurant car we then went to the bar car and got aquainted with our fellow travellers. The 3 piece band began to play a very entertaining selection of Peruvian and international music and the included bar service commenced for the entire trip. after about an hour we were escorted to our tables and the food service began. All of the food was very good and the complimentary wines from Chile and Argentina were very reasonable quality. Service in all respects was friendly and very professional, I would like to say a special thank you to our waiter Paulo who looked after us very well. All through the trip we were being kept informed and made aware of local customs by our concierge Carlos who gain did a fantastic job. On our arrival at Agua Calientes we skipped the lines and took our Belmond bus up to the gates of Machu Pichu. Our guide for the tour of the breathtaking citadel was Carlos who was superb and made our visit perfect.Then we went to the Belmond Sanctary Hotel for a delicious afternoon tea followed by our bus back to the station. The return trip was much the same as the upward trip but includes a more substantial gourmet meal and people seemed more inclined to drink more alcohol and the party in the bar car began. The band handed out a variety of percussion instruments and we all got involved in the music making, it was seriously good fun had by all. When making the decision to pay the extra for this trip do the sums, All the food and drinks are included, the quality of service makes you feel special, the entry fees to Machu Pichu are included, You get a top notch private guide included, afternoon tea at the Sanctuary Hotel is included, live entertainment is included , bus transfers are included. Overall I think it was worth every penny and I would not hesitate to do this again, go on splash out you wont regret it."

Being the guests of the Hiram Bingham, we were also invited to the afternoon tea at the Sanctuary Lodge.The only disappointment was the disorganized bus ride we experienced when we arrived Machu Picchu Station. We did not quite understand why the guides handled such a small group of guests so poorly once we got off the train when that was something they do everyday.

I booked this journey over the internet from Australia before travelling to South America. PeruRail couldn\u2019t have been more helpful with responses to a couple of questions that I needed clarification on after reading the website. They processed payment and issued my tickets which I printed off and took with me. There is quite a cost differential between the other trains and the Hiram Bingham but this is an experience from the moment you see the Hiram Bingham backing into the station. For those who haven\u2019t been to Poroy Station, there is a small caf\u00e9 and water vendors at the entrance for last minute purchases. You don\u2019t need to worry about any of that if you are travelling on the Hiram Bingham. Having arrived at Poroy Station early enough to see one of the other trains depart (thanks to CuscoShuttle service! \u2013 see that review) \u2013 after the mass of people left on the early train, there were only a couple of others waiting \u2013 so I wandered around and took some photos and watched the Belmond team set up for our departure. Starting with a Belmond branded check in counter and a tray of champagne to greet guests as they exit the station for the train \u2013 it was a bit early for champagne for me with a long journey ahead but there was another non-alcoholic option \u2013 I\u2019d had some breakfast back at the hotel so happy to watch everything unfolding! Ticketing provides a dedicated seat in one of the carriages and Russell was allocated as my waiter. Shown to my seat in the carriage and in the meantime, some traditional dancing and singing was underway on the platform. Wonderful to watch and prime yourself for the trip ahead! Colourful, traditional and musical \u2013 everyone enjoying the spectacle. A few other travellers jostling for the best view and forgetting that others might be there first and taking photos \u2013 I was taking a quick movie on my iPhone when some woman, a late arrival, dashed in front of everyone so we all have her in our movies! A bit thoughtless, but hey, there\u2019s lots of that as you travel the world. Not going to let that spoil my day! Dance show over, time to get underway \u2013 carriages are beautiful, so comfortable, big picture windows. As I was travelling alone, I didn\u2019t have to share my seating so had a dedicated table \u2013 all white linen, beautiful little table lamps and branded glassware. This was going to be a great day! Trundling off from Poroy through the suburbs, towns and into the Sacred Valley. Easy photo opportunities without too much effort just through the picture window. Food, as expected was fantastic! A couple of Danish pastries and orange juice to whet the appetite and just couldn\u2019t wait for the lunch menu! Lovely wines partnered with the meals with sparkling or still water on tap. The three-hour journey went smoothly and quickly. It was really relaxing. I was there to enjoy the scenery and the adventure. There was live music in one of the cars and I wandered through to see but it was really loud and noisy and I preferred the peace of my seat and the passing scenery \u2013 so headed back to my seat. I detected a look of envy from some travellers on train platforms as we moved through a couple of the stations. On arrival into Machu Picchu Station, the Hiram Bingham passengers have a dedicated waiting room \u2013 with bathrooms and tables and chairs. Took a little while to sort out who was going with which guide but once sorted we headed off through the market area across the river to the bus collection area for the trip up to Machu Picchu. Buses sorted and on our way. Not having to organise any of these connecting activities was a huge advantage \u2013 the whole day is organised including a very informative guide. The landing area at Machu Picchu entry is totally chaotic and is the last bathroom stop (take some Soles to pay for bathroom) before walking into the ruins. Guide was fantastic \u2013 although one criticism (and was commented on by another reviewer) \u2013 spent too long standing in the sun telling us history when all we wanted to do was walk around and take photos \u2013 then hear the history. I asked to move on and not waste time standing around \u2013 time for me was limited and Australia to Machu Picchu \u2013 yep, unlikely to do that again so I wanted to maximise my time there. Lucky we were a group of three plus guide, so it was easy to move around \u2013 advantage of being slightly off season. Followed the signage within the site and guide provided commentary on key sites, temples, etc. Not time to do high climbing nor across to the housing areas at the base of Huayna Picchu \u2013 but I was so happy just to be there that it didn\u2019t matter and enough views to satisfy! The day was stunning so photos are glorious. Other advantage with the Hiram Bingham, is that with the later arrival time, many visitors have already left to start their return journey \u2013 so I have photos with no-one in them. Later in the day, headed across to the Belmond Sanctuary Lodge (included in he experience) for afternoon tea \u2013 our small group were a bit late getting there and didn\u2019t really have time to enjoy the fabulous spread, but Machu Picchu was the focus \u2013 so afternoon tea was secondary! That was not before the ranger brought his troop of llamas back from their free-ranging - so what an escort out of the ruins! Back on the bus for the return trip down to the station. Assembling in the dedicated waiting room, everyone looked weary and ready for the return trip! Lovely to have somewhere to rest and collect yourself before the homeward journey. A few tired bodies on the return journey \u2013 it was getting dark and completely dark by the time back to Poroy. Dinner was a highlight \u2013 wonderful to experience five-star dining trundling slowly back to Poroy. There appeared some who did the one-way journey back to Poroy \u2013 who were so tired they just slumped on the table and didn\u2019t really enjoy the experience. I was pampered with a pillow and rug as the evening was cool and the train carriage was a little chilly. On arrival back, there was my trusty cusco shuttle waiting for me to take me to my hotel \u2013 the end of a truly amazing day! One note for travellers, each table has a power point so take a charge cable/adaptor for your accessories - then your iPhone is fully charged ready for Machu Picchu."

The one way trip includes morning tea, three course lunch, private tour guide and afternoon tea. The one way journey does not include the bus ride back down to Aguas Calientes but our tour guide is kind enough to give us a complimentary bus ride back to the train station for us to catch our return journey with Vistadome! The service is impeccable and the food is superb quality, we really enjoyed the tripvery much! Highly recommended!"

It is a magnificent old train with a fabulous interior. The first hour or so of the journey can be taken in the 'bar' carriage where a trio of musicians get everyone involved (if they want to) whilst enjoying a drink or two.Then dinner is served in the dining car. It is all silver service and very good too. Maybe not the best meal ever but not bad for a train. After dinner you can stay where you are or return to the bar for more entertainment.A great experience especially as we were in quite a big group so the atmosphere was very good."

            "review": "Outstanding. The Hiram Bingham experience is without doubt a must do if wishing to visit Machu Picchu and budget permits.Looking purely at the economics, this option cannot be solely compared to the much lesser priced Vistadome - 10 times cheaper, the Vistadone is not 10 times worse... it is an excellent train with good service, a decent snack and some entertainment provided through a traditional dance and a small fashion show, awkwardly but sweetly done by the train's won crew... very fun. So for US$80 return, Vistadome is a great way to reach Machu Picchu in comfort.Why then pay US$800 for essentially the same journey - because with Hiram Bingham you get an entire end to end experience - on the way to Aguas Calientes a great lunch in the wonderful dinning car - also access to a bar and observation car with musicians.Upon arrival, you're assisted to a waiting room and then transferred to the entrance of the site via private buses whilst your luggage or bags are securely kept (or transferred directly to a hotel if staying overnight). There, guides are assigned in small groups (we actually had booked a private guide but our initially assigned group was only comprised of 2 more people besides us four). After the visit (3 to 4 hours) you reconvene in the Machu Picchu lodge for a high tea which is very comprehensive with lots of different delicacies. This is a well-thought program which allows a great visit as well as plenty of rest.For those staying overnight, it is then time to transfer to your hotel and for those returning to Cusco it's back on the train for dinner and a final transfer.The organization is precise, the guide and staff excellent and this is without a doubt the best way to visit the incredible Machu Picchu site.I would suggest two options: either doing this as a day trip, only using the Hiram Bingham train or if budget and availability permits, using the HB train but also staying one night in the Machu Picchu lodge (also operated by Belmond). This provides what I'd see as the ultimate way to experience this magnificent site."

They not only played music but worked the crowd with their wit, humour and enthusiasm which was very infectious.Despite the chaos we were expecting, the bus transfer from Machu Picchu was on time, we were quickly checked and processed onto the train where we were greeted with a glass of wine and entertained by the musicians till it was service time for dinner.

All visitors to Machu Picchu, whether going with Hiram Bingham on using regular services, should be prepared for some chaos. Late trains, lack of busses, huge crowds, general disorganization and lines. In addition to the great train experience and staff attention, you are paying to avoid some of the chaos. Generally Hiram Bingham does okay but it's not perfect. There were major bus delays on both ends of our tour, impacting the experience. The tour of the ruins was okay but also cut short. The staff did their best to help manage the guests through all of this but even the first-class service could not make up for some problems at Machu Picchu and along the way. The food - I'd characterize it as a slight step above Business Class airline food. Nice Peruvian flavors but not what you'd get at a top restaurant in Cusco. The Train, entertainment and onboard experience were top-notch - Five StarsThe Staff - Fantastic Great Pisco sours on board."

You are able to take this gloriously elegant train from Cusco to Aguas Calientes either as a one-way trip in either direction or as a return trip. Be sure to check train times if you are planning on observing the scenery as the evening train journeys afford no views due to the surrounding darkness. Certainly traveling by this train is like taking a jump back in time in terms of style and service but manages to do so without being shabby or tacky or inefficient. Service is world class, as one would expect. The four course meal that is provided with the ticket is classy, refined, and often has a Peruvian flare to it, which is very enjoyable and certainly unique, e.g. cream of quinoa soup. There is a wonderful bar car (drinks are included with your ticket, too - woohoo!) with live entertainment and we found ourselves dancing and laughing with the band for the entire duration of the journey. Epic fun! Other helpful tips for the keen train traveler - there is a separate platform and waiting lounge with cocktails for Belmond ticket holders. You may book ahead of time but booking in Peru is actually cheaper and we found there was reasonable availability when we did so about two days ahead of travel. I suppose that may depend on the season, however, so best ask a local tour guide. The dining car seats groups in tables of four or two persons - as we were a group of six, we requested seats opposite each other, instead of in line with each other, and the team was happy to accommodate our request. This was absolutely a highlight of our trip and we will remember this experience our whole lives. We saved a bit on cost, though, by taking up the Inca Dome train for the views, and then the Belmond Hiram Bingham down to Cusco so we could enjoy our meal and the experience as a whole instead of obsessing over taking pictures. Worked out brilliantly for seeing the valley on the way up and we did not break the bank accomplishing our 'bucket list' item!"

Before you board the train you are treated to afternoon tea at the Sanctuary Lodge. You then board a bus that is exclusively for Hiram Bingham passengers. You are taken to a decidedly Colonial waiting room at the train station where drinks are served. After this each party is escorted by their steward to their seats on board where you are served a lovely three course meal. They even offered to bring items for my children that were off the menu.Admittedly, this is the most pricey option of transportation that can be chosen for this journey but if romantic train journeys are on your bucket list this is a great one to choose."

It's really an experience and an unforgettable one at that. The journey to Machu Picchu is full of anticipation - arriving just in time to have a tour of the ruins and afternoon tea at the hotel nearby. The next day we'd climbed Huayna Picchu and were tired out but enjoyed the party atmosphere as the train trundled back to Poroy in the dark. The two trips had a quite different feel but both were perfect bookends for the visit to Machu Picchu itself. The food and drink were good, the service excellent and the entertainment very enjoyable. Our guide at the ruins was superb and helped make the trip - he rambled on forever but he was so proud of his heritage that you couldn't help but admire his enthusiasm even if you didn't take it all in. All in all, whether on the daytime descent into the jungle to Machu Picchu or the party on the return, it was thoroughly enjoyable and, yes, probably worth every penny."

At Machu Picchu we had a guide (part of the cost) that took five English-speakers around to see the sites for about two hours- very low-key and comfortable, not having to scramble to hear what was being said. Afterwards the afternoon tea in the lodge was plentiful and delicious.

The Belmond Hiram Bingham is a fantastic way to spoil yourself on the way to MP and enjoy a four hour ride to the famous Incan site. You are greeted with Peruvian music and a cocktail as you board the train. The staff takes great care to attend to your needs and ensure you have every comfort available to you during the ride. We spent most of our time at our table drinking tea or cocktails before the lunch was served. The meal was also delicious, starting with smoked trout then on to a steak. We briefly went to the back car where the bar and band were playing. It was pretty packed, as other passengers enjoyed the spectacular view. The train would usually honk whenever we saw folks hiking the Incan trail. Once you get to MP, you can opt for a tour guide. We had Yrma who was absolutely fantastic and very knowledgeable about MP. She deftly navigated thru the large crowd at the entrance of MP and quickly moved us to the top of the mountain. This gave us an unbelievable introduction into MP and she graciously taught us about the history of MP throughout our three hour tour. Fun tip from Yrma: bring three coca leaves and when you get to the sun dial, make a wish, say the name of MP, HP and a peak in your country, and then place the leaves on the ground. Yrma told us the magic of MP should grant us travelers our wish. At the end of the tour, you are given tea at the Belmond's hotel at MP. We did not have enough time as we opted to take the Vistadome back to Cusco. All in all, it was a great way to get us to MP and start off that leg of our trip on a high note!"

We took the Hiram Bingham from the Sacred Valley (Ollententaybo) to Aguas Calientes, and then back from Aguas Calientes to Cuzco (Poroy Station). The train is absolutely beautiful and you can imagine yourself in the golden era of travel aboard the Orient Express (which this train used to be called). The service is great, the food is wonderful, and the entertainment in the bar car is really, really good. The only downside is that the trip back to Cuzco leaves at 5:50 pm and arrives in Poroy at about 9:30 pm. It is dark the whole trip, so there are no views at all...and it makes for a very long day by the time you get to your hotel in Cuzco. But, the late departure does allow you to stay up at Machu Picchu until the bus leaves the Belmond Sanctuary.Lodge to take you down to the train station at about 4:45 pm."

From champagne when you board to the great food and free drinks. Since we were touring MP that day, didn't drink very much. The train is beautiful and service is great. The trip also comes with a 2-3 tour of Machu Picchu and tea at Sanctuary Lodge. In addition to the dining cars, they have a bar and also observatory cars. Train is a bit rocky but I think it is all part of the experience. It is really a great experience and we are glad we did it as part of our trip."

We travelled on this lovely train to Machu Pichu, and back.On the way it was daytime, so beautiful,scenery to look at.We had brunch, which was in fact a full blown lunch at 11.30 am. We went into the bar and had music from local musicians which was fun.On the return, we had a very different experience.The music in the bar was loud, and fun. Lots of pisco sour, and dancing!!We had dinner, which was again delicious.More music and dancing, but we were so tired we just relaxed and chatted to fellow passengers till we reached our destination.The train is a great experience and on returning to the station, we didn't need to queue for about a hour, as we had a private shuttle bus back to the station.

We were picked up from the hotel and escorted to the railway station around 20 mins from town. The train leaves daily from around 9 am except Sunday's. The trip to Machu Pichu is around 4 hours and you are in a train of very high quality and finish with a non stop supply of anything you needed to eat or drink by staff who were outstanding, including a three course meal, wine, beer etc. you are then escorted to up the mountain via coach to the entrance of Machu Pichu and your guide will look after you throughout. We had Carlos, brilliant. When the tour is over you are invited for afternoon tea and more food at the local cafe and then escorted back to the train for the four hour journey back to Cusco. This trip can be pretty loud as the alcohol flows and the Americans are not short of an opinion or two but it was all good fun. We got back to Cusco around 9.30 pm. It's a long day, you can of course stay overnight in Machu Pichu and break the trip up. At only 6000 ft above sea level I never suffered as much as I did in Cusco so it was also nice to breath air with a bit more oxygen. Overall quite expensive but everything is taken care of and when you overtake the other trains that are crammed full of people who tried to save a buck you get to appreciate the decision you made."

For excursions like this, it just isn\u2019t done.From my Holland-America and other sources (Moon), I was expecting a true luxury experience. That didn\u2019t happen. In effect, I wasted some valuable time getting to Machu Picchu. (On the return trip, that wasn\u2019t a factor.)To start off, what was supposed to be a 15-minute ride to meet the train at Poroy station turned out to be a two-hour haul over the dreaded mountains and switchbacks to Ollantaytambo, or halfway to Machu Picchu.Ok, what I was expecting was a leisurely journey with my genteel, somewhat elderly Holland-America crowd in relaxed, roomy surroundings that the brochures spoke of. Instead, the train was packed with an equal sized complement of rowdy, boozing, hell-raising X-ers. In addition to the elevated noise level, one could hardly turn around, and the tavern / observation car was inaccessible because of the crowd.Dining service was variable. The brunch going down was excellent but too much for a midday meal \u2013 better suited for an evening meal. The \u2018trout\u2019 on the return dinner menu turned out to be salmon. There is a difference, you know. Another unmet expectation.On the positive side, the facilities and service provided were excellent.My only basis for comparison is Alaska Railroad\u2019s \u201cMcKinley (now Denali ?) Explorer.\u201d Less pretentious than the Bingham, it would still be my choice for a riding experience."

I've always been intrigued by the Orient Express style trains so booked a one way on the Hiram Bingham, direction Cusco to MP. The whole experience is amazing!! From the absolute meticulous service you receive each step of the way, the abundance of food and drinks (and tea), to an unforgettable train ride and visit of MP with a great guide. Given, it's expensive, i payed around 350$ one way but it's worth every cent. My thoughts: Stay one night in Aguas Calientes - go by HB and return by Vista train the day after (100$), there's no need to spend almost 700$ on a return ticket."

This car seats up to 8 passengers, in comfortable surroundings, wood paneling, banded yew wood tables, upholstered swivel club chairs, a private chef and wait staff. To charter this car costs $1250 one way, while the Hiram Bigham costs upwards of $300.00 per person. Do the math. Enjoy"

The entertainment at the train station was enchanting before boarding the train to begin our exciting adventure to reach Machu Picchu. The first part of the journey is spent in the last carriage where you are entertained by local musicians and can breakfast on cappuccinos and pasteries at the bar along with local fruit or sip on an early morning Pisco Sour. This is a fun part of the journey, then the scenery starts to get more beautiful and you move to the luxury dining carriage to be served lunch. It has a very oldy worldy feel to the whole experience a bit like being in an agatha christie 'who done it'. Absolutely loved the entire journey. Once we arrived in Aguas Calientes we were transferred to a luxury coach for another breath-taking scenic journey up to Machu Picchu. We stopped off at Sanctuary Lodge to check-in and be shown our rooms. Then our guide gave us our first glimpse of Machu Picchu. It was worth staying over night at the lodge so as to do more exploring of Machu Picchu at daybreak the next day. We were blessed with beautiful clear days both days.

They did transport us in nice luxury buses though. The reception into the train was very nice, there was drinks, music and little snacks. The train is beautiful but seems a bit worn, one of the toilets barely worked. The open caboose was the best part. The live music was excellent and the bar was well set up. The meals were all gourmet but a few were not very tasty. The cheesecake was awful. Our waiter was barely anywhere. When we arrive, he did not greet us until 45 minutes to get our drink order. We kept asking for bread, and since he was too busy for us, the bread ran out. We paid 800 dollars per ticket and we could barely get bread or our drinks. When we arrived at Machu Picchu station we easily found our guide and headed into Machu Picchu. Our guide was excellent and knew a lot about the site. Afterwards the long tour, we were very happy to see the buffet lunch included in our package. The buffet was very good with desserts, pizza and sandwiches. Getting on board was a nightmare, they had no idea what they were doing and said we might get different seats. After getting on board, turns out they over booked a poor lady and her daughter. To sum up the trip, I was glad everything was all inclusive and convenient; the food, all transportation, tour of Machu Picchu, and the buffet lunch. But they need update their facilities, menu and embarkation process from Mach Picchu."

Traveled on the Vista Dome train from the Sacred Valley to MP. This was 1 1/2 hour beautiful day trip and returned via the upgraded to the Hiram Bingham dinner trip which leaves at 5:50PM. The Vista Dome day trip was wisely suggested by the Belmond agent due to shortened duration from the Sacred Valley and window views. January is considered \"rainy\" season, the Hiram Bingham only goes as far as the Sacred Valley ending at the train station next to the Belmond Rio Sagrado Hotel, requiring another 1 hr 15 minute auto transport to Cusco. Belmond handled every aspect of the transfers with private guides each step of the way, no stress. Our Belmond tour guide accompanied our van transport to the train station in the town Aguas Calientes. When it was time to board the HB, the train steward came into the Belmond HB depot waiting area, greeted my wife and myself, and personally delivered us to our dining car seats. This indivividual was the primary person providing service throughout the trip. Many individuals attended to us assuring every detail of our needs were met. Full service china, multiple courses, Peruvian food and South American wine was enjoyable. Glad we had the experience. The only surprise was the rainy season shortened route. I believe they actually slow the train so we could have a 2 1/2 hour experience. Outside of rainy season you travel to a town much closer to Cusco, if that is your final destination, for a 3 to 3 1/2 hour trip. On a final note, don't let the rainy season in January fool you. We had 8 days of very good weather and little rain. Locals say we benefited from El Nino."

High tea before the bus to the train was better than dinner. The reception with passed appetizers and champagne was better than the dinner. So there really was no reasonable excuse for the overpriced and poorly planned dinner exercise. We did not enjoy the amazing gazpacho from Peruvian sweet tomatoes - instead a tasteless potato soup.We did not enjoy the local wonderfully blended Peruvian white and red wines or even more champagne - instead cheap Argentinian and Chilean wines. Then it was a standard fare Peruvian trout filet and an underwhelming duck leg. Management has a problem, not the great staff or equipment as they were terrific. Very disappointing."

The service from the minute you arrive at the train station in Poroy and back is fabulous. The food and drink is first class as well. We spent the night at the Sanctuary Lodge and had to bring an overnight bag. The Belmond provided us with duffel bags. We were a little unsure of what to wear on the train but everyone was very casual. Bring a sweater or a jacket, was a little chilly in the morning and evening on the train. The train stores your overnight bag for you then delivers it to the hotel. We did see several passengers with smaller sized suitcases but for the most part everyone had bags with just enough for one night. Not a problem to bring items on the train in a pack of some kind, plenty of room. The last car has a bar and open back for viewing. When you board in Cusco/Poroy the train then stops again in Ollantaytambo. Brunch is served after stop. The sightseeing along the way is fantastic just from your seat. When arriving in Aguas Calientes station Hiram Bingham has private buses to drive you up to Machu Picchu. They stop at the Sanctuary Lodge at base of Machu Picchu where you can get checked-in or get changed if you're just spending the day. At the end of day you meet the buses at the Sanctuary Lodge drive back to Aguas Calientes. The train station there has a private waiting area for the Hiram Bingham which has snacks, drinks and restroom. They really thought of everything, you're very well taken care of. The train ride back to Cusco/Poroy was so relaxing with a wonderful dinner and drinks. There is music in the back train car if you choose to go back to bar. Otherwise nice and quiet if you choose to stay at your table. The Poroy station is about 30 to 40 minutes from Cusco. We were worried about the logistics of spending the night, bringing bags, train ride but it was quite easy."

The pace, service, accommodations and menu set this up as a truly luxurious way to travel to and from Machu Picchu, and it does feel like train travel from another generation. For most in our party, the trip from Machu Picchu to Cusco was amazing. But for a few, there was a desire for the meal not to have taken the full three hours so we could rest, walk around, etc. But the views, the bar car, live music and observation car made this a memorable journey and an integral part of our family's experience in Peru."

I had originally booked the Vistadome from Cusco to Machu Pichu but received an upgrade offer to the Belmond Hiram Bingham so I decided what the heck. I was already spending a small fortune on this trip so why not a little more. I am so glad I did, this was one of my top 10 life experiences for sure. The elegance of the train and the level of customer service was something I had never experienced before. You for sure feel like a one-percenter. The food was incredible, the staff amazing, the beverages free flowing and the scenery gorgeous. I didn't want it to end but when it does, you are at Machu Picchu so you are okay with it.Besides the gourmet food and luxurious transportation, the Belmond Hiram Bingham also arranges your transportation to, entry into and a guide for Machu Picchu, afternoon tea at the lodge next to Machu Picchu and your return trip to Aquas Caliente. I figured all of the extras plus the convenience factor made the expense worth it. Did it ever! Everything was seamless and as close to perfection as I could imagine.I stayed at Machu Picchu a second day and ran into the manager from the train from the previous day. Despite no longer being a passenger or his responsibility he came over to say hi (he even remembered my name) and asked if he could assist me with anything. We chatted for a few minutes and I left feeling that he and this company REALLY cares about their passengers. My return trip to Cusco several days later was on the Vistadome which was a very pleasant experience but just didn't compare to the Belmond. If you can come up with the extra money to do the Belmond Hiram Bingham I wouldn't hesitate!"

After a two day transportation strike that nearly knocked us out of this trip (note to self about this possibility) we were so very happy to get tickets for our trek to MP the day following the strike. Everything was going as planned - great departure, lot's of fun, a wonderful lunch, energetic music and great drinks in the observation car. Then the train stopped. Another train had broken down about a mile from Aqua Calientes and they were unable to move it - not forward or backward. And now it was pelting rain (makes a difference in a few more lines). After a few hours and much deliberation the staff had us get off the train, grab an umbrella and walk along the side of the tracks - in the muck and rocks. We walked past the broken down train and on down the tracks to another train that had been pulled up to the one that was disabled. You might think that this would have been a big mess. Well, it was a little mess, but the energy of the staff and our guide (Angela) turned it into more of an adventure than a disaster. We ultimately arrived to Aqua Calientes and then on to Machu Picchu. Keep in mind we were very late at this point and in doubt as to whether we would even get to see MP after all that we had been through. The site allowed us to stay until 6pm - bless them, which at that time was nearly dark. The trip back to Cusco ran very late - we were 2:15 am getting back to the hotel. We couldn't even make up this story -- and we kept a light spirit. Dinner was great, drinks help just about anything. We saw MP and it is fantastic. I commend the Hiram Bingham staff for making the most out of a bad situation. They could have simply sent us back, but their commitment to getting us to our destination made for a GREAT story! If I ever go back - I'll go Hiram Bingham. It's a little more expensive, but it's THE way to make this trip."

Brunch was also excellent and the band provided great entertainment, while the Peruvian landscape passed by. We had a return ticket for the next day and although the trip is good too, at night without the view it is not quite the same. I would do it differently next time and and just get the day time one way. But I highly recommend the Hiram Bingham and its great staff to all Peru visitors. Fun and also romantic."

From the moment we arrived at the train station in Poroy, the service was exemplary. After checking in, we were shown to our seats on the train (and seated in a spacious booth for four even though we were just two) and given glasses of sparkling wine. We spent the first hour or so of the train trip in the bar car \u2013 there was live music and great views from the back of the train. A three-course lunch was included in the trip as well and the food was delicious. All of the wines to accompany the meal were included as well. (I would note that the meal was billed as \u201cbrunch\u201d when I booked, but it was really lunch, not breakfast food at all.) Included in the package was our entrance and guided tour of Machu Picchu. There were only four of us in our tour group and our guide was excellent. By the time we arrived at Machu Picchu in the early afternoon, many tour groups were starting to leave, so the site was slightly less crowded. We also enjoyed the tea provided at the Sanctuary Lodge in the afternoon after our tour of Machu Picchu. The only negative about the Hiram Bingham would be that the tickets were a bit difficult to book online."

There was also a three piece band playing. Ordinarily, I\u2019m not keen on this sort of thing. However, the players were really quite talented and a lot of fun \u2026 with all those watching being given percussion instruments to jam along with. I do, however, hope that any videos of my dancing never see the light of day. All in all, a nice way to travel back to Cusco."

I am a wholly deaf solo traveller \u2013 on Tuesday 8th September, 2015, I was picked up by the transfer taxi at 8.10am from Belmond Hotel Monasterio Cusco (approx. 30 mins driving journey each way). I arrived at Poroy Railway Station, the other tourists (whom I met there) and I were greeted by the friendly members of Belmond Hiram Bingham staff! They escorted us to our seats in the early 1920\u2019s vintage type train.  During the train journey to Aguas Calientes for Machu Picchu, we enjoyed looking at the beautiful Peruvian countryside scenery from the train\u2019s bar carriage with the observation car where we drank various drinks and the live musical band played (I cannot hear, of course) before we had the brunch meal in the dining carriage.  We arrived in Aguas Calientes, we got the bus to Machu Picchu. The friendly Peruvian male guide showed the 3 other tourists and myself around Machu Picchu. I asked him if we would visit the House of Guardians with the breath-taking view of whole Machu Picchu \u2013 he said that we would go there after visiting the other parts of Machu Picchu first. Unfortunately, he talked to the other 3 tourists too long than necessary while I waited in the less important part of Machu Picchu \u2013 such waste of time! We did not have enough time to spend at the House of Guardians, so I had to take some photos of myself with the background of whole Machu Picchu in a hurry and I did not get a chance to walk up to the House of Guardians before we had to return to Belmond Sanctuary Hotel for the afternoon tea. I was not happy! We should have been there at the House of Guardians a bit longer \u2013 it\u2019s an important part of Machu Picchu than the other parts!  We returned to that train and the live musical band played again in the bar carriage for the evening drinks before we had the dinner in the dining carriage. We arrived in Poroy after 9pm that evening before our transfer taxis picking us up for returning to the hotels in Cusco. It was the greatest lifetime experience!"

I would note that the \"rack rate\" for this trip was high at US$499 however I don't expect that this is close to the far lower packaged price we paid as part of our whole of Peru experience so make enquiries."

We entered the magical wood and brass, crystal and linen sanctuary of our car after a beautiful day on Machu Picchu, ordered dinner from the limited but elegant menu, and proceeded down to the bar car for Pisco sours and a Spanish trio of guitar and drum. The car was filled with Spanish and Mexican tourists, some Europeans and Americans. Everyone started to sing along with Guantanamera and Volare (even Americans know those). But then the dancing on a moving train began, Flamenco style with maracas and castanets handed around. Honestly, haven't had such a fun night out in years. Worth the splurge."

This is the (super expensive!) but three course luxury meal and top service private train for max 84 people. With observation balcony, bar etc. Due to the rest of the package also (excellent private tour guide, private bus up and down to the ruins themselves from Aguas Calientes, bypassing all queues, entry of MP guaranteed and included, making use of nightfall to have dinner) and the highly interesting mix of people on board for the trip, really the top way to see Machu Picchu. We think there are two best ways to experience Machu Picchu, this is the one, and the other extreme is to walk the Inca trail - if you're up to it."

From arrival to departure, the service and experience were first class! If you're into hiking the Inca Trail and roughing it, this isn't the train for you. It's expensive and luxurious. I'm so glad that I spent the extra money and went this way. It was a very special experience for us. Some people choose to take the train one way back to Poroy. It's a great time, but you miss the incredible views along the way. The ride up leaves promptly at 9:05am. Don't be late! It's about 40min taxi from Cusco. Do yourself a favor and leave an hour ahead of time so you get their early. They greet you with mimosas and traditional dancing in the train station. You get seated at your table and they take your order for brunch. This was fine dining absolutely! After taking our order, we were free to wander to the back of the train where the fun begins with a three piece band and a bar car with an open-air patio on the back. Drinks and snacks are included in the price except for premium liquor. Pisco sours were plentiful though. Be careful though, they can sneak up on you and you've got a big day ahead. Stay hydrated!!!! The views on the way to Machu Picchu are fantastic. Once we got there, we had our own guide for two of us. He took us around the entire site showing us various points of interest and giving us background information. Machu Picchu is amazing. Just don't miss it, no matter what if you go to Peru. Seriously, it's better than any picture, post card, poster or documentary I've ever seen. if you don't take the Hiram Bingham train, get there somehow. After touring Machu Picchu, we had afternoon tea at the Belmond Sanctuary Lodge. There were lots of little snacks to choose from that were all beautifully displayed and very delicious. The tea was refreshing after hiking around Machu Picchu, but if you wanted a pisco sour(or some other cocktail), that was available too. The ride back to Poroy had more people on board due to some people taking the train one way. It was dark on the way back and so no awesome views. However, the atmosphere on board becomes more of a party...especially in the back bar car. There's live music again and dancing. Dinner was absolutely first rate. The train manager was the best. He was very helpful, attentive and friendly. He arranged for us to have a quick visit to the kitchen car with the chefs who were friendly and putting out some fantastic food!This was a first class experience. It's very expensive, but they really delivered throughout the day. It's worth it if you're looking for this type of experience. You can certainly spend less money, but this is pretty much a once-in-a-lifetime experience. Go for it!"

We were booked only from Ollantaytambo, not Cusco, meaning that the journey was half the length we expected. The cost is not halved however; full price is still paid. This may or may not not be the fault of Hiram Bingham; it could be down to Lima Tours, or the Belmond Group, trying to ensure that the Rio Sagrado hotel gets its share of business, it's difficult to tell. Having said all of that, the experience we did have was delightful. The scenery is spectacular, especially when viewed from the well appointed observation car. Lunch was pretty good given the fact that one is eating on a train and the staff were pleasant and attentive. Due to the shortness of our journey, lunch felt somewhat rushed which was a shame. The train seems to be less smooth a ride than the Andean Explorer, but it is nonetheless an experience well worth having."

You cannot compare the methods of transportation - it is impossible. The Bingham train is extravagant and totally worth every penny. Beautifully polished brass, wonderfuly comfortable tables and exceptional meals and service were all here. We rode both the am and pm trains and both had great attributes. Beautiful vistas and terrific scenery in the morning along with a great brunch of filet made for a wonderful start to the day.

            "review": "A split personality experience. We took the evening train from Machu Picchu back into Cusco with great expectations, using this experience as a test for whether we would enjoy longer experience on some of Belmond's other luxury trains like the Orient Express or the Royal Scotsman. Our experience was of mixed results.On the positive side, the train is absolutely beautiful, exceptionally well maintained and looks exactly like the picture on the website. The service provided by the staff was professional, friendly, and attentive...but then again, not significantly better than the service on the Vistadome (our way of coming into Maccu Picchu). Dinner was exceptional, with a beautifully laid out table and comfortable table for two (which we really appreciated). And the food was very well prepared and presented, with near perfect balance between all of the flavors. On all of these categories, the trip met or exceeded our expectations.On a negative note, the train has not been marketed/positioned reflective of its more affluent status. I'm not being snobbish, but am saying that A) there are cheaper ways to travel and B) that one expects similar travel companions if one it traveling on high end luxury mode of transportation. In short, if you're a \"luxury train experience\" (as Belmond describe the experience), then you better deliver on it. We dressed appropriate to the people we saw on Belmond's website showing the train (oxford shirts, khaki slacks, shoes and socks)...only to be greeted by a vast majority of the passengers wearing gym shorts, tank tops, flip flops and other attire more appropriate at the pool...but clearly not for dinner. Boarding of the train was not some civilized \"call your name\" event (given that everyone had assigned seats and package was handled by porters), but instead a free-for-all with passengers cramming through the doors to be the first ones on the train...boarding on Southwest Airlines \"open seating\" is generally handled better. And then, once aboard this beautiful vintage train, the lounge car became a \"sail away\" event on a party cruise with exceptionally loud music, conga line dancing and power drinking (after all, wine & beer are included in the price). Now, there's nothing wrong with a party cruise, but if you go on a party cruise boat lead to believe that it will be a \"luxury experience\", then one is going to be in for a shock. I think the crowning blow was when the \"traditionally Peruvian Band\" broke into The Eagle's \"Hotel California\" and The Stones \"Satisfaction\"....sorry, I enjoy both of those songs, but that wasn't what I was lead to believe would be the entertainment on my journey.One could say that Belmond isn't responsible for the behaviors/attitudes of fellow travelers...and to a degree, I would agree. However, much like cruise lines, the Hiram Bingham should set \"the tone\" for the journey, making it clear what acceptable attire is (just like on cruise lines), selecting appropriate entertainment, and possible increasing pricing reflect a more luxury travel experience closer to the one promised on their website.Based upon this experience, I would never take the Hiram Bingham again nor would I spend the $1500/night per person for their luxury trains elsewhere. If I'm going to spend that kind of money, then I want something more than an airline boarding process, a \"sail away\" party and The Eagle's \"Hotel California\"."

The experience was a contrast: the train itself is beautiful and the service was excellent but the \"entertainment\" was exceptionally loud and reminiscent of happy hour on a cruise ship. We enjoyed some aspects of the trip and were extremely disappointed with others.We were on the Macchu Pichu/Aguas Calientes to Cusco train, and arrived at the station a little before the indicated time. Due to the elegant nature of the train we decided to wear clothing that was a little dressier than what we had been wearing during our jungle/mountain adventure. Other people started to arrive dressed way more casually than I would have thought appropriate. The \"band\" played Peruvian music to set the mood and orange juice and sparkling wine were offered prior to boarding.Andy, the Train Manager, approached us and asked for our passports and got our seat assignments. Shortly after we were escorted onto the train and shown to our seats. We were very impressed by the elegance of the train. Our waiter told us that once we departed they would take our dinner order and we were welcome to go to the Bar car for a cocktail before dinner. I hadn't had a martini since we had been in Peru (two weeks) and was looking forward to enjoying one.Once we placed our order we moved to the bar car, which had a very nice bar with stools and several banquettes that were already occupied, and ordered drinks. Shortly after, the band started playing, and playing LOUD and not Peruvian music. Hotel California? La Bamba? Seriously? The people seated on the banquettes were really getting into it, which was great for them. For those of us that were expecting something a little more subdued it wasn't so great. Being the space was small the music an revelry was only amplified, making conversation nearly impossible. Sadly we only stayed a short while and returned to our seats.Dinner was served at 7 and it was excellent. The included wines were also very good and the service was polite and professional. We finished dinner about 30 minutes prior to arriving in Cusco and were given our bill for the drinks from the bar car (@$15 per drink). We arrived on time and disembarked the train, and we both agreed that, while we were glad we tried the Hiram Bingham, it didn't live up to the positive press and we wouldn't do it again.Possibly our expectations were set way too high. Maybe Belmond will change the \"entertainment\" to better match the atmosphere of the train (a guitar player would work nicely), but having crystal glasses and china plates while a band plays \"Hot! Hot! Hot!\" just doesn't seem to match."

The station goes nothing away as it is just another stop on the busy PeruRail network ..... however, as the train pulls in and the staff alight it all becomes clear that you are in for a treat. Professional, friendly and English speaking staff check tickets and escort you to your allocated seats in the main cars ... wide and comfortable fabric covered seats, very elegant and reminiscent of the past age of steam travel. Brunch was served almost immediately after leaving the station and was presented well, and tasted wonderful. The trains bar car and observation lounge were unused by us as we only had an hour and 30 mins on the train taken up by eating but the views from the window are stunning enough to not miss seeing it from the rear of the train. Arrival in Aquas Calientes is chaotic and slightly scruffy looking but its all part of the adventure. We took the train both up and down from MachuPicchu which is lovely but you must realise the return journey is all after sunset so the scenery is nonexistent but dining with new found friends was a real bonus. definitely worth the extra money on your trip."

My wife and I had a wonderful eight night private customized tour organized by Belmond Journeys in Peru staying at Lima, Vale Sagrado, Machu Picchu, Cusco. We took the Hiram Bingham train from Ollantaytamdo to Machu Picchu (were we slept at the Sanctuary Lodge) and returned next day on the evening train to Cusco. I have to say that this train is a long way from being an Orient Express Luxury experience.On the way up we had our wonderful private guide Belmond guide Jorge meet us at Aguas Calientes to help us get on the bus to Machu Picchu, Sanctuary Lodge. The main issue was on the evening trip back where we were left in the hands of a rather grumpy Hiram Bingham guide...he seemed to have an attitude problem, telling guests to find their own way back to the Machu Picchu train station after we left the bus at Aguas Calientes. There was one scared American tourist who was terrified of getting lost who tagged along with us! The food on the train was OK, but hardly five star...equivalent to business class US airline cuisine at best. On a positive note the waiters were very attentive and friendly and worked hard to please.I know I will sound snobbish here but this train is certainly not on the same level as the Belmond hotels we stayed in Peru (MiraFlores Park, Rio Sagrado, Sanctuary Lodge and Palacio Nazarenas). I do understand that in order to reach a break even point they have opened up the train for use by passengers who are not staying at Belmond hotels. My suggestion would be to have a separate carriage for Belmond guests with a higher level of cuisine and specific Belmond trained staff: this would be \"1st class\" and for other passengers they would have the current service as \"business class\".If you are on a budget travel and have to choose between this train service and an overnight stay at Sanctuary lodge: do not think twice - get the Vistadome train and stay at Sanctuary lodge. If you are not travelling on budget and on a Belmond private tour, it is still the best option to get to Machu Picchu, but be prepared for a drop in service, food and general ambiance."

On the return trip there were \"Huelgas\", small riots. The Hiram Bingham people did not want their train damaged so we had to go back in a backpacker train. They sent 2 security guards with us all the way back to Cuzco and paid for our dinner at the Monastery Hotel. They even refunded half our trip and gave us a discount on our next journey.

Everything included in the rate was delivered, but not with the flair expected. We were the first to arrive at the VIP lounge at the Aguas Calientes train station and while it was clean and comfortable there was no Belmond representative to greet guests. There were no local entertainers at the station as shown in the pictures on the Belmond Hiram Bingham website. Finally, approximately 15-20 minutes prior to boarding a flustered Belmond representatives arrived at a check-in podium. There were no signs or announcements and so several guests inquired about boarding and were told to sit down and wait to be called. Shortly thereafter they called a few guests that were waiting, but as other guests arrived they would proceed straight to the podium and then board. Incidentally, we were never called and ended up boarding last. In a chaotic and hurried manner, approximately 15-10 minutes prior to departing Belmond representatives set-up and distributed wet towels and welcome drinks while the onboard entertainment trio played a piece. In our opinion, it was a very disorganized and rushed process. Once onboard, it was a little more structured. Before dinner we proceeded to the bar car where there was live entertainment. It was a very festive atmosphere - everyone was drinking and dancing. Dinner was very good considering it was on a train. Overall we enjoyed the Hiram Bingham train experience. However, based on the fare per person and reputation, we expected a well-organized boarding process and elegant experience at every level including the MP/Aguas Calientes train station VIP lounge."

Excellent old world charm with warm wood panelled interiors in the observation deck and bar bring forth a luxurious aura that's difficult to see in a train anywhere nowadays. The trip started with coffee and champagne and the food and wines flowed forth!

Our train had 2 dining cars, where your seat is assigned by staff, this may mean you get your own table or will be seated with others at a table of four. The last car on the morning train is the bar car, which can get pretty rowdy (as the Piscos flow), especially on the night train return. A small band plays local (and not so local) songs, they don't need the amplifier, as it makes for loudness that's hard to talk over. In this same car is the back observation area, to get good views of the passing scenery, farms, small towns sheer rock walls framing the gorges. Ride is 3.5 hours one way. Once up in AC, and a short jaunt thru the market, we are shown to the bus (valued at $24US for two and included in the train ticket price) which takes about 20 or so minutes to reach the beginning of the park. You are dropped outside the Belmond Sanctuary Hotel (the same parent company as the train service, and the only hotel actually located at Machu Picchu). Entrance to MP is also included (approx $50 US each) in the ticket price. At the entrance/exit to MP, don't forget to get your stamp for posterity sake!A guide (English speaking) for small groups is also provided to tour the park, about 3 hours of walking the site and learning the \"truth\" about Bingham's find and National Geographic/Yale University's role100 years ago. At the end of the tour, the group re-meets up for tea at the Sanctuary (also included in price) for 45 minutes before the bus returns to AC.The return HB train is mostly in the dark, a nice dinner is served as part of the ticket price..along with wines and piscos, the bar car band encourages group participation as entertainment. A pricey ticket for return travel, but everything is taken care of for you, which makes for ease. Don't forget your HB duffel bag that is provided complimentary too!"

We purchased our tickets through travel agency but I will say that you should not pay attention to the seating on your ticket, as it is merely allowing you on the train. Prior to boarding a train representative with a master seating chart, will guide you to a seat or seats.The trip up is different from the return trip as the return is in the dark.The personnel on the train are excellent and very efficient. On the return trip dinner is served a few hours out of the final stop so I took the after dinner time to visit the club car and found that I was the only one other than the band, bar and wait staff. I had more fun going back because they played and we laughed and talked.The train will give you a personal bag for each ticket holder and you can bring this and another smaller bag. My wife and I stayed 2 nights in the Inkaterra and found that these two bags were more than large enough to accommodate our needs."

We enjoyed this train ride and the food was excellent as was the staff but most of the people on this train thought they were above everyone else. They were rude to the wait staff and we had a table of four that decided to play loud music on their IPad. It was so loud we went back to the observation car to get away from it. When I was in the observation car there were people standing the back of the car that would not move so I could get some clean shots of the river and scenery even though they were not taking pictures. I would not do this again."

Having travelled previously on a \"luxury\" train the Hiram Bingham fell very short of being luxurious. The food was unremarkable in both taste and presentation and the drinks were lukewarm and mostly unpleasant. The staff appeared to be flustered and it appeared they were short of staff. I would suggest the daytime service may be better as at least you can be distracted by being able to view the scenery."

The train itself was very nice, although since we are younger and had packs, they seemed to treat us a little differently at first. Sort of as though we didn't belong there because we weren't dressed in slacks and dress shoes....which was irritating. Anyway, the train was nice and we had a nice table for two. We went to the bar car for the first hour and had an enjoyable time....the pisco sours were quite good. Then we went back for dinner. The food was excellent and the wine was fairly good as well. The waitstaff was nice and accommodating and I was able to get a vegetarian meal that was not on the menu. Our car was rather rowdy as there was a large group at the one end that was rather loud and kept shouting \"Viva Chile\"....this was annoying. The train also got in about an hour late, for which no explanation was given. So, all in all it was nice, but probably way overpriced considering the issue mentioned above."

I was concerned that we would not get the \"full\" experience because we were not able to take the entire Cusco-Aguas Calientes route because of the rainy season and the shortened train service. My concerns, however were unfounded and the HB was definitely one of the highlights of our trip. From the beautiful dining car, to the bar cars with champagne and pisco sours, to the fun observation deck with live music and entertainment, there was something special for everyone in our family. Yes, compared to the other trains, the HB is expensive. If you travel one way on the HB and the Vista Dome the other, which is what we did, you get more \"bang for your buck\" if you do the one way to MP. On this route, your tickets to MP are included, plus the private bus from the train to the Citadel, a small guided tour of MP with a HB guide, and an afternoon tea in the Sanctuary Lodge. If you chose the return to Cusco one way, you will only get the train and dinner, and not the other extras mentioned above. Of course, round trip on the HB, you get it all! We chose to spend the night and do an extra day at MP. We were very glad we did. Although the HB return would have been lovely, the extra time we had the next day was well worth it. For one, it was raining when we arrived and during much of our tour. The next day we were met with beautiful sunshine. We were able to see MP in the mystique of the rain and clouds and also in the glory of the sunshine. We also then had time to hike to the Sun Gate. All in all, it was a splurge that was well worth it, and one I would do again. It was the perfect balance of luxury and adventure our family was seeking."

At first, I was hesitant as how she'd treated due to the fact that she uses a personal small 4 wheel walker. This was no problem at all at the HB train. From the train, bus, tour in MP and afternoon tea at the Sanctuary Lodge, the staff, especially the Tour Guide, Carlos, were so amazing. Carlos went out of his way to make sure my mom and I were comfortable and happy. He was extremely patient with us and never left our side through out our journey until we were safely back in the hotel shuttle. So we wouldn't delay the rest of the group visiting MP, Carlos - HB Tour Guide, even provided a private tour for my mom and I so we could go at our own pace and be extremely happy. My mom was so happy that she came to MP and we have tons of pictures to share with the family. Belmond is extremely lucky to have a wonderful associate such as Carlos, representing their company. He is the reason I'll return and recommend tons of other passengers aboard this wonderful train. Truly worth every penny spent."

After putting in my meal order, I went to the bar car and listened to the band and danced with other passengers until the meal was ready. The band was a lot of fun, playing a mix of songs in English and Spanish. They went out of their way to make it a fun experience by involving the passengers like an intimate concert performance. To be honest, the time in the bar car was the highlight of the trip so if you don't want to listen to the music, you might not enjoy this trip as much as I did because then you just are having dinner on a nice train and IMO it is less an experience and more just transport (nice though it may be).The only thing I did not enjoy was the tea that is included at the Belmond Lodge at Machu Picchu. The service was spotty at best (in fact, I could never manage to get served any tea at all) and the food was mediocre."

The 3 hour trip from the combination hotel/ train depot was a bit slow paced and pretty bumpy. With the exception of a combination bar/open air observation/live entertainment hub all other cars were dining cars so you constantly felt like you were being prepared for a meal. Of course you actually were as two meals brunch on the way to MP and dinner on way back to Sacred Valley were provided along with all beverages. If you are staying in Cusco it's about 90 minute drive to Sacred Valley to catch this train. The food, service and dining car ambience were exceptional but it fell short of being the \"romantic\" trip it could have been. Still HBT is first class all the way even down to a bus reserved for the final leg up to MP. Having already experienced it If I'd return to MP I'd probably just throw a snack in my back pack and catch a regular PeruRail train up to the site."

You pick up the train in Wanchaq station and about 9am..you are in Agua Calientes by about noon, and the last 2 kilometers takes about 20-30 minutes up a steep switchback road...the views are AMAZING!..to backtrack, while on the train on is served brunch, a four course meal, and includes Pisco sour, wine, beer, also Peruvian live music in the bar car. The trip includes entree to Machu Picchu and a private guide ( our group had 7 people, all english speaking)for about a 3 hour tour ( which just about killed me)...but the views were spectacular, the guide well informed...it's just I have arthritis and it was a bit hard keeping up the pace. At the end of the tour , around 4:40 we all met back up at the Sactuary Hotel (The only hotel in Macchu Picchu - I hear it can take a year or more to get a reservation)--we had high tea, then went back down the mountain to Agua Calientes to catch the HB train back to Cuzco. Not much to see outside because it was dark by then..but the bar car had a very lively group of travelers and live musicians playing and dancing until dinner was serving in the dining car at 6:30...another 4-5 course meal with, wine, beer, Pisco sours....even got a lesson from the bartender in how to make one properly...after arriving back at the Belmond Hotel ( 1/2 way) we returned to the buses for the last part of the trip back to Cuzco...I think pretty much everyone fell asleep from total exhaustion."

We had some difficulty initially for my credit card blocked the first attempt. This is a tip: Contact your card company and indicate that you will be placing a foreign charge and amount. This will make the booking seamless. We received personal attention after placing call to agent for Perurail. She walked me through the process and even stayed on line till transaction was complete. This is just the beginning of the outstanding service to expect on this \" Journey of a Lifetime\" Our trip began in the Sacred Valley station steps away from the Belmond Rio Sagrado Hotel. A delightful greeting with tea, assorted pastries etc. and a staff graciously greeting each guest and after check in escorting them to train platform. The temporary steps made the climb onto the awaiting train very easy for ascent. What awaits is a sheer delight! You are personally escorted to your table complete with all amenities one would expect in this luxurious dining compartment. Tables are spaced to allow for privacy. The observation car in the rear was the place to be for the journey until Brunch was served. Music, drinks, and wonderful photo opportunities! We even did a\" rhumba\" or two as we gently rolled to our destination. Brunch was delicious & service 5 star*.Transfer to bus was also seamless. Our guide Gherman was knowledgeable and also accomodating to whatever physical challenges one might have based on age and fitness. Our small group of 4 experienced an amazing tour of MP. Tea at the Sanctuary Lodge was a nice experience and well done! The return transfer to train was escorted by staff and once again the experience continued with fine food, drink and convivium.  We arrived at Rio Sagrado station to await transfer to bus and as expected, our luggage was waiting for us to be boarded for our trip to Cusco and check- in at Belmond Hotel MonasterioOne of our personal mantras is \" We will run out of Time before Money\" Spend the money for this incredible experience!"

This is DEFINITELY a bucket list/ life event however the entertainment and food should NOT have to compete with the unbelievable scenery between Cusco and Aguas Caliente. For that reason I HIGHLY recommend taking the Vista train to Aguas Caliente during the daytime, and indulging in the Hiram Bingham in the dark. You need the incredible views from the Vista Train to fully appreciate the unbelievable sights which are the Andes----its simply breathtaking!We knew it would be a pretty special trip when we showed up at the station over 30 min. before departure and the musicians in the bar car were already playing a tango. Endless trays of complimentary Pisco Sours accompanied them as well as a very happy group of South Americans who were already celebrating. Its a festive atmosphere from the time you hit the door of the special station room for HB passengers.Food was incredible, service outstanding and as I said, fantastic entertainment. We thoroughly enjoyed talking to our fellow passengers in the bar car----some Americans and some South Americans and Europeans. The trip between the two towns in the dark is good for either sleeping, or having one incredible time on a train like the Hiram Bingham. SO GLAD we chose to splurge and enjoy ourselves!"

Travelled from Poroy Station (about a 30 minute drive from Cusco) to Aquas Calientes (end of the train line for Machu Picchu), a distance of some 112 kilometres but the journey took just under 3 1/2 hours due to the fact that in many places it is a single line and we had to stop to allow other trains travelling in the opposite direction to pass. We also made several stops at some train stations along the way, principally, at Ollyantaytambo. There was also one switch back section that allowed us to lose some altitude. We took the Vistadome train 2 days later for the journey back from Aquas Calientes to Poroy.I had purchased the train tickets on-line from the PeruRail website and had found this to be a reasonably simple exercise. I was though concerned when allocated tickets 1 and 6 in carriage A that we might not be sitting together but an email to PeruRail and a speedy response from them assured me that these seats were single seats opposite each other. The seating was in a configuration of 1 seat (with another opposite facing it with a table in between) then a bench seat for 2 people (again with another opposite for 2 people with a table in between. Effectively in each row 3 people faced the direction in which the train was going and 3 were going backwards. Cost of tickets included a guided tour of Machu Picchu, afternoon tea at the Belmond Sanctuary Lodge (located just outside the gates to Machu Pichu) as well as the return bus tickets from the train station to Machu Picchu.Station at Poroy was reasonably comfortable with a small cafe. The Vistadome train also leaves from here and it was the first train to leave about 20 minutes before us - the Hiram Bingham departing on time at 9-05 a.m from the same platform as the Vistadome train.There was a check-in booth inside the station where our names were ticked off and we were shown to some seats in Carriage A but these did not match the seat numbers on our tickets. I had read on Trip Advisor that this had also happened to some previous travellers and there had been some awkward scenes when the people originally allocated those seats had turned up to claim them so I asked our porter/steward, Hugo, as to whether we could sit in our originally booked seats. He proceeded to tell me that there were no seats 1 and 6 opposite each other which was clearly not true as I discovered on a quick walk down the carriage. I pointed this out to him upon his return and he said he would speak with his boss. When he had not returned some 10 minutes later we just moved to seats 1 and 6 and nothing more was said, though it wasn't a great start.Our train only had 2 buffet/dining carriages, a bar carriage and an observatory carriage. All were beautifully appointed Pullman cars and our table was set with a linen table cloth, China plates, crystal glasses and silver cutlery. When we left Poroy station our carriage was only about 60% full but it picked up more passengers at Ollyantaytambo. There was also some musicians on the platform (who boarded the train) and some very colourful traditionally dressed dancers (who did not).Whilst I understand that you can organise to store some larger luggage on the train most people just had small bags. We took two soft sided sports bags - one of which fitted into the open storage shelf above our seats and the other under our seats. We had left our larger bags in storage at our hotel in Cusco.Train was very comfortable although we spent much of the journey in our allocated seats in the dining car and in the Observation car. The musical troupe was playing in the Bar car but this was pretty well occupied by what appeared to be a local dignitary and his entourage including cameramen.Food was OK - a 3 course set menu starting with trout ceviche, a chicken dish then cheesecake (with a cornflour base) and tea/coffee. Drinks, including a champagne not long after boarding, and beer/wine were free. Service during the meal was good but drinks at other times were very slow to arrive. We also received 2 soft sided travel bags as a gift from Belmond.Great and varied scenery. The line started initially through fairly flat farm land with lots of horses, cows and goats (all tied up as there were no fences between the different fields and no barriers to stop them going onto the train line). Also went through the middle of a couple of smallish towns. Passed a man slaughtering a pig beside the train line while his son stoked the wood under a big black pot of what looked like boiling water.Further on the snow capped Andes loomed above us and as we moved into the mountains we started to travel beside a fast flowing river that would accompany us almost all the way to Aquas Callientes. Just past Piscacucho we sighted some people trekking the early part of the 4 day Inca Trail journey.Upon our arrival at Aquas Calientes, we were met by representatives of the Sumaq Machu Picchu Hotel where we had booked a 2 night stay - fabulous hotel - who took our bags away to the hotel whilst we followed our tour guide - Carlos - ( who had journeyed up on the train and introduced himself to us on the train) to the buses that would take us up to Machu Picchu. Belmond had reserved seats on 2 separate buses. Our group was only comprised of 7 people.Prior to heading into Machu Picchu, we stopped at the bathrooms at the gates - there are no toilets inside Machu Picchu. Whilst the cost of entry to the toilets was only 1 Sole it was free for Hiram Bingham travellers. We also received priority entrance, past a couple of fairly long queues of people, into Machu Picchu.Following our guided tour of the ruins, which lasted about 2 1/2 hours, we adjourned to the Belmond Sanctuary Lodge for afternoon tea which comprised drinks (including tea and coffee) and a range of snacks including sandwiches, canap\u00e9s and cakes.At about 5.40pm we were given a signal that there was a bus waiting to take us back down the hill to Aquas Calientes.Overall the whole day trip, apart from the initial issue with our seats, was particularly well organised by Belmond.Would I recommend it - probably yes, provided that the price still included the guided tour of Machu Picchu, bus fare up and back plus afternoon tea at the Belmond. I am not sure though that I would recommend the return journey from Aquas Calientes to Poroy as this journey generally leaves late in the afternoon and finishes after nightfall. As a result you would miss much of the magnificent scenery."

Both give you a once in a lifetime experience. By this train, you get luxury service as it was in the great days of train travel. From the service pre-boarding to the meals onboard, to the semi private tour of the ruins, you are treated like royalty. My suggestion is to stay overnight at least one night in Agua Caliente, either at the Sanctuary at the top or Inka Terrace in the town."

If there is any problem, I wish you the best of luck in dealing with this company's management staff for any kind of compensation or even considerate treatment. We departed from Poroy Station on Wednesday, November 12th. The trip started very well, but approximately 10 km away from the station the train stopped and we were told we were waiting for another train to pass. After waiting for about an hour, we were told that the train engine was experiencing mechanical problems and we were driven back to Poroy station in reverse. We were told that a backup engine would be swapped out then we would be on our way. We were supposed to be served lunch at 1100, but about 1130 an announcement was made that lunch would be served. Then as soon as the food started to be brought out (and before anyone could eat anything) there was another announcement that we would now be driven by bus to another station down the tracks to catch another train. We were all herded into buses and I endured the most grueling, bone-jarring bus ride in my life. About an hour later we arrived at the train station and boarded the Vistadome for the remainder of the journey to Aguas Caliente. We were served a so-called \"box\" lunch which consisted of a stale sandwich, cookie and a banana, literally served up in a cardboard box. We finally arrived at Aguas Caliente over 3 hours late and driven up to Machu Picchu by bus. Since we arrived so late, the park was closing so we had a very short visit, then a nice tea service at the Sanctuary Lodge.The Hiram Bingham staff made no attempt whatsoever to discuss how and if any of us would be compensated for the money paid for a luxury train ride as promised and not delivered. After inquiring, we were promised tickets for another day visit to Machu Picchu since we had our tour cut short due to the Hiram Bingham's engine problems. We also asked if we could have our Vistadome tickets for the return trip on 14 November, upgraded to the Hiram Bingham since we never had the chance to experience the luxury train ride and meal we paid for. The train staff kept telling us this was \"no problem\" and that the main office was aware of our request. We were given a set of entrance tickets for Machu Picchu for November 13th. and we were told that we would have the Hiram Bingham tickets waiting for us at the Aguas Caliente station. When we inquired about our return tickets at the Aguas Caliente station, we were told that there were no tickets and the Hiram Bingham office was not aware of our issue. On 13 November, as we tried to enter Macchu Picchu, we were told our tickets were no good. So we spent the next couple hours or so trying to resolve the ticket issue and thanks to the incredibly devoted management and staff at the Sanctuary Lodge, we were finally able to enter and enjoy the park. After returning to Sanctuary Lodge we spoke to the Hiram Bingham manager, Mr. Javier Carlavilla, who was incredibly rude and condescending, stating \"you were delivered for a Machu Picchu tour and were given a box lunch, so what is the problem?\" He also promised he was going to email the Hiram Bingham tickets to us then never sent them. Later that evening we went back to the Aguas Caliente station and asked if we could meet with Mr. Carlavilla. After we met, he was less than cordial, it seemed as if he was trying to make us feel guilty for asking for compensation for an \"act of god\", something totally beyond his control. He told us that we could just \"show up\" 14 November and tell the train staff that he said it was o.k. for us to ride the train. Really? After our experience earlier in the day of being denied access to Machu Picchu we asked for actual boarding passes. He became enraged at this, acting as if it was a tremendous inconvenience to produce a pair tickets, that he now had to call his boss to make this happen. After about an hour of excruciating waiting and arguing, we finally received our boarding passes. In fairness, the return ride to Poroy station was magnificent and without a hitch, it's a shame that the whole experience had to be tainted by the exceptionally unprofessional management of our situation."

Due to that, I'll refrain from speaking about value, as that's only relative to price. The service on the train was top notch. We were seated in a nice dining car, with tablecloths and flowers in vases. Once the first server knew our name, everyone in the train knew it. And they used our names whenever greeting us. It was one of those little touches that means a lot. Our tickets included drinks, snack, lunch and entertainment in the back bar car. I enjoyed champagne, pisco sours, and white wine (with lunch). The pisco sours were by far the most enjoyable drinks, with the champagne and wine being a bit too much on the sweet side for me. Admittedly, I do normally prefer fairly dry vintages. Lunch was good and the ingredients were very fresh. We are vegetarian and pescetarian, and they were able to accommodate both of our dietary needs on the ride. We had bread, salad, a main course and a dessert. The salads in Peru only really seem to be available with a vinaigrette style dressing, but it was pleasant nonetheless. The salad included beautiful avocado and peeled/seeded tomatoes. I'd never had tomatoes in my salad that had been peeled and seeded, but it was actually a nice touch. It meant they were easy to chew and not watery at all.During the ride, the views are beautiful. You go from high elevation in Cusco to a cloud forest (very tropical) and the mountains change a lot during that transition. Occasionally, you pass by small towns and farming along the railroad. Some of the most memorable moments were when we passed through a town and young children were running through the streets to wave at our train as it passed. We spent time in the bar car, where there was a band playing Peruvian music (and the occasional song that inspired all of the visitors from Mexico to sing along). They provided snacks in the bar cars (dried vegetable chips and gooseberries are what I recall) and continued to serve beverages. It was a very relaxing experience and felt like a luxury, especially in that part of the world. When I asked our tour guide (part of the tickets we purchased included tickets into Machu Picchu and a guided tour, followed by afternoon tea at the hotel owned by the Hiram Bingham company) if all Peruvians visited Machu Picchu, I was surprised when he said no. He said that it's too expensive for many. As a bonus, before we left the train, we were provided some small travel bags as a souvenir from our train ride. The only downside was that they had been stored somewhere humid and had mildew on them. When we discovered this later, we abandoned them. When we arrived at the train station, they took our luggage and ensured it arrived at our hotel. We then took the buses specially chartered for the train guests up the hill to Machu Picchu. This saved us from having to get in line and wait for who knows how long for available seats on a bus. The ride up the hill is lots of switchbacks and scary turns. If you get car sick easily, a dramamine may be called for. After our tour of Machu Picchu, we enjoyed lovely afternoon tea at the Belmond Sanctuary, the only hotel right next to the park. It was delicious and again provided plenty of options to satisfy both of our diets. Afterwards, we again loaded into buses for our group, avoiding a 1-2 hour wait other visitors made standing in long lines."

My wife and I decided to splurge a little and ride the HB on our way from Cuzco to Machu Picchu. The train leaves from the Poroy station, about 20 minutes from Cuzco, and not from the city itself, probably because it's a narrower gauge than the Andean Explorer to Puno - which we also traveled in. Check-in was fast and efficient, but we were a little surprised to be seated in a different wagon than our tickets indicated. That in itself was not a problem. On the platform, passengers were entertained by musicians and dancers. The railcar was beautifully decorated, the seats very comfortable, the ensemble giving passengers a feeling of glamorous travel back in time. The bathrooms were spacious and quite clean. After departure, the bar soon became crowded as a trio of musicians performed for the passengers. Personally we found the sound level way too high, and we were amused by the trio's repertoire which consisted mostly of Mexican songs - besides \"El C\u00f3ndor Pasa\", there are not many Peruvian songs recognized by gringos. So we did not linger in the observation car, also because the landscape was not very attractive, at least during the first couple of hours. We skipped the Pisco Sour demonstration but did not refuse the offered drinks - good thing they were on the weak side. Because the train runs on a very narrow gauge, it's not the smoothest ride, but that's part of the fun. Then it was time for lunch. The food was fine, and given the galley's constraints, they did a pretty good job. Service was excellent, pretty much like everywhere else in Per\u00fa. Unfortunately, lunchtime coincided with the most spectacular landscapes, and much to my regret I was not able to take any photos. I thought I would be able to do so on the way back, but it was not to be. We disembarked in Aguas Calientes, and had to take a somewhat awkward walk to the waiting bus which took us to the Sanctuary Lodge. The following day, on the way back to Cuzco, the check-in was also quick, and again we were seated in a different car than our tickets indicated. When my wife asked the fellow about the reason why, his response was \"Don't worry, that's my problem\". And it did indeed become his problem, and ours as well, because a couple walked in, and told us that we were seated at their table. They insisted to us and the conductor that this was the table they wanted, period. After some awkward moments, both the conductor and the couple's tour guide came to apologize and ask us to move to another table, and of course we did, there had been enough of a scene as it was. We could have been offered a drink on the house, but we were not, and being the rascal that I am, I did ask them to do so, and of course they had to comply. Again, same loud music in the bar, and again dinner - also fine - prevented me to go to the observation deck and take photos. A good portion of the ride back took place at night. Now I do understand that scheduling the rides is a tricky affair, so I still would recommend visitors to Machu Picchu to experience the Hiram Bingham, albeit with the caveats above. But I can't find an excuse for our being - rather forcefully - assigned different seats than the ones on our tickets, thus creating a scene."

The Belmond hotels took care of the arrangements for us once I decided upon our transportation to Machu Picchu. The Hiram Bingham train is amazing and a really fun way to go to Machu Picchu. It is reminiscent of the glory days of train travel and the ultimate in luxury. IT IS WORTH THE DIFFERENCE IN PRICE IF YOU CAN AFFORD IT!! They greet you by name with a mimosa and show you to your table for brunch when you board in Ollantaytambo on the way to Machu Picchu (if you are staying in the Sacred Valley). The ride is beautiful and seems to go by quickly when you are eating brunch. Upon arrival in Aquas Caliente they put the Hiram Bingham riders in a waiting area complete with drinks and then walk you over to the other side of the street to catch a bus to the entrance to Machu Picchu. What a ride that is!! I\"m not great with heights but it was still beautiful going up so high into the mountain (25 minutes) with very seasoned drivers who seemed to have no trouble backing up on the narrow winding road to let a bus going the opposite direction pass. The Hiram Bingham provides a knowledgeable guide (our was Jesus - very proud of his heritage). There were 8 of us in the tour which was a perfect size. We spent just over 3 hours walking all over the amazing Machu Picchu, then went into the Belmond Sanctuary Lodge (the only hotel at the base of Machu Picchu) for afternoon tea. We all boarded the bus (there were 2 groups from the Hiram Bingham train) and rode the 25 minutes down the mountain. Those of us not staying in Aguas Caliente got back on the train and since my husband and I were getting off at Ollantaytambo rather than with the rest of the riders at Cuzco (Poroy to be more accurate) we were shown to the bar where live (and lively) music was being played (and pisco sours were being served). We sat there enjoying the music until our dinner was to be served. Dinner is elegant and tasty as one would expect from a fine restaurant. They stopped at Ollantaytambo for us to get off. Our driver was waiting with a flashlight at the exit of the train station and called us out by name which was fortunate because it was very dark outside and there were several taxi drivers waiting. The drivers they arrange through the hotel all have very nice cars, they provide water bottles and it is very comfortable and helpful when they know you name. The Hiram Bingham train to Machu Picchu made the visit the best possible excursion- definitely worth the cost for a once in a lifetime total experience!"

            "review": "Wonderful experience! We'll be back!. We took the Hiram Bingham train both ways to Machu Picchu and LOVED the ride! We booked on line in the U.S. I was a little nervous about doing that--the tix are not cheap and, if anything went wrong, we didn't have a back up plan... but no worries, we were greeted at the Poray train station with champagne and local music to begin our adventure. (Note that the Poray train station is about a 25-30 minute cab ride from Cusco hotels.) We were then seated in the dining room at our table for 2. I found the seats comfortable and the table convenient so I could set up my lap top and iPad. You also have access to the bar car and the panorama car. On the way to MP, my husband spent much of his time before lunch in the panorama car taking pictures. We were thrilled to be taking the train both ways, but I know some opt to take the train one way. The experiences we thought were very different, so here are some pros and cons of each:The ride to MP starts about 9 in the morning and arrives around 12:30 pm after lunch. So, although drinks and wine are free, we didn't have more than a small glass of wine with lunch. The lunch was very tasty. The ride is all during daylight, so it's good for getting pictures from the train. The band plays, but it's not too boisterous early in the morning. However, a huge advantage is that when you get to Aguas Caliente and take the bus to the hotel, you have a guided tour of the ruins included by a truly first class guide who speaks English well. Our guide was wonderfully enthusiastic and, although she only works part time and also works in the H Stern shop at the Hotel Monasterio (wish I could remember her name) her tour was one of the highlights of our visit! I think our time at MP would not have been nearly as well informed if we had not begun the visit with this guided tour. The train ride back leaves around 6 pm and gets back around 9:30 pm. This train is a party train for those who choose to join the singing and dancing in the bar car (which was everybody on our train). The only downside is that in August, the ride was mostly in the dark outside because it's the Peruvian winter, so not great for pics. The band is truly awesome (we bought their cd) and when the music program ended for dinner, everyone was dancing, no matter how old or how young. The dinner that followed was wonderful and again, all drinks are included, so we could enjoy a few pisco sours. As noted, Poroy train station is about a 30 minute ride from Cusco. The train crew helped arrange taxis for anyone who hadn't already booked a ride. Before I forget to mention, the bathrooms were great and I'm very picky about these. Also worth noting for independent travelers like us, we spent the night at MP and found out that we couldn't buy tix for MP on the second day at the park (only the first day was included with the train). Fortunately, our hotel (the Sanctuary Lodge) was able to find some, but if you book before you travel, you'll have less stress. Of course, this had nothing to do with our wonderful train ride. We thought the train was worth the splurge price and plan to do it again!"

This was the most fun train trip I have ever had and the perfect finish to my entire Machu Picchu experience.Yes it is expensive (USD400) but get on with an open mind, go right to the bar carriage and be prepared to enjoy the following:(1) A REALLY awesome modern Peruvian band (Trio Sabor & Sentimento) - these guys are serious professionals ie. not your typical Peruvian Pan Flute at your Sunday market. Think Santana and Gipsy Kings - mad voices and even more mad guitar skills! Plus the audience gets to join in - dancing and playing instruments. This goes for 1.5 hours at least and was the best part of the trip for me. (2) Pisco sour class while listening to the awesomeness that is (1).(3) Very good quality 5 course meal which wraps up the remaining 1.5 hours of the train trip.The rest of the positive points have already been covered in all the other reviews - absolutely beautiful period train which is classically Orient Express and very friendly staff.The only negative point I can think of is that the train leaves for Cusco in the evening which means it is too dark to enjoy the landscape ... but heck, you'd be too busy dancing to Santana and Gipsy Kings to notice :p"

My husband and I took the Vistadome train from Poroy to Machu Picchu and the Hiram Bingham train from Machu Picchu to Poroy (see separate review of the Vistadome train).The trip began with afternoon tea in the Sanctuary Lodge just outside the entrance to Machu Picchu. The afternoon tea in itself was nice and felt like the perfect ending to a visit to Machu Picchu. There were some odd things: we finished touring Machu Picchu an hour before the beginning of the afternoon tea. We were led into the dining room, where the afternoon tea would take place, but at no time during this one hour did a single member of staff approach us to ask if we wanted to order some refreshments or drinks. Also felt odd that there was no alcohol (even the typical glass of sparkling wine) included in the afternoon tea. We ordered some extra things and they had to be paid in USD. Luckily we had some left over from Ecuador but this was the only place in Peru where we were told to pay in USD and it felt odd.The bus from the Sanctuary Lodge to the train station was the same/normal bus that we took up by ourselves in the morning. For some reason, I had expected a different, more luxurious Hiram Bingham bus. This wasn\u2019t really an issue, though. Just be prepared for some absolutely terrifying hair-bend turns coming back to Aguas Calientes. I was sure we were going to fall off the cliff and die.Check-in, however, ruined things. I had understood beforehand that check-in would be lovely with drinks and a band. We arrived to the check-in terminal at the designated time and were handed some warm towels, which was nice. But after that we were quickly ushered to sit down and no one asked or served any drinks to us. Some other people did have drinks. Two seconds later a harried looking member of staff approached us and wanted to know in which hotel we were staying in Cuzco. We provided the hotel name to him and then asked why he needed it. He couldn\u2019t really respond. 30 seconds after that he told us that he\u2019d checked us in and we should hurry and get on the train. This was 30 minutes before the train was scheduled to leave. Yes, there was a band playing and yes, we could probably have flagged down a waiter from somewhere to bring us that glass of sparkling wine I had been looking forward to ALL day but this check-in person was adamant that we needed to go. Now. We stopped outside the train to take some pictures but he said we could do that \u2018later\u2019. By this point we were so annoyed that we were being treated like two five-year-old children who\u2019d run away from kindergarten, that we let him take us to our seats in the dining carriage. We dumped our things on the chair and went out again to take some photos. After that, we sat like obedient children at the dining table for 25 minutes. Nothing happened. I went to the bar carriage to ask if we could get some sparkling wine because we wanted to celebrate and toast our day. The waitress looked equally harried. Yes, yes, later, I was told. It materialized an hour later.This whole check-in experience was our first experience of the journey back to Poroy and we were everything but impressed.Luckily, the actual ride was better.It was a lovely old-fashioned train with a fun and very loud band playing in the bar carriage while people sang along and the drinks flowed (the pisco sours were probably the worst of all the ones that we had in Peru but the Peruvian sparkling wine was surprisingly nice).Food was very good, not earth-shatteringly memorable but still very good, especially considering you\u2019re on a train.The included wine, however, was bad. We complained about this but were only told that there was one other included red wine (equally awful) and were then handed the menu with prices. Didn't feel that the situation was particularly well handled. I avoid train toilets like the plague, but the ones on the Hiram Bingham one were actually nice (definitely better than airplane ones!) We took the Hiram Bingham train back in the evening from Machu Picchu and of the two options, I thought the Vistadome train was definitely much better value for money. If you want to try both options, I would take the Vistadome to Machu Picchu in the morning and the Hiram Bingham back to Poroy in the evening since the Vistadome had much bigger windows (also up in the ceiling) so it would provide a better view since it will be pitch black once you start your trip back to Poroy. Also, the Hiram Bingham train has a lot of drinks that are included in the price and I felt that it was nicer to enjoy those on the way back than to arrive to Machu Picchu completely hammered. The Vistadome train was also quieter and did not rock back and forth at all as much as the Hiram Bingham train did (this might partly also have been due to it being dark outside). I had to take a seasickness pill on the Hiram Bingham train because I got nauseous (and this was before the alcohol!) whereas I had no issues on the Vistadome (and I get motion sickness relatively easily).In the end, we tried to put the negative things behind us and had a good time but for this price Hiram Bingham needs to provide a seamless, from start to finish perfect experience which it unfortunately did not. If I could, I would give 3 and a half stars."

The train was an experience in itself - everything was just wonderful, from the bubbly they meet you with as you board the train to the impeccable service and excellent food. I travelled with a vegetarian, and of course they had a vegetarian option for the lunch menu. We enjoyed every minute of it and really felt we got our money's worth. We had: 2 glasses of sparkling wine, espresso and cakes, fresh juice, fruit, live music, 3-course lunch, 1 glass of white wine, 1 glass of red wine, another espresso, smooth bus transfer to Machu Picchu, entrance past the queues, excellent guiding for 3 hours, lovely tea etc. at the Sanctuary Lodge, bus transfer back to the station where our luggage had been stored. And no queuing in the rain. We stayed overnight in Aguas Calientes at a cheap, but clean and friendly hostel and went to the site museum next morning before taking the Vistadome back. The Vistadome was like flying Ryanair in comparison - noisy and commercial. Be advised that the taxi ride to Poroy station can take 30 minutes."

            "review": "A Little Bit Disappointing. The day I travelled on this train from Poroy to Machu Picchu there were only a handful of passengers, which made for a bit of a strange atmosphere. I enjoyed the colourful folkloristic welcome, although no one explained what the masks and dances were about. The train was plushly decorated, but the observation car at the back was also the place where the band played, and played, and played -- to the enjoyment of my fellow passengers who were more interested in drinking pisco and champagne than viewing and photographing the landscape. When I could take the noise no longer I returned to my seat for a bit of peace and quiet, and to await the serving of brunch. This was rather elaborate, but I cannot say that it was overwhelming. I was quite glad to reach Machu Picchu. Here I had my own guide who was included in the train ticket and who was exceptionally nice, although I did not really need his services as I had been to Machu Picchu before and just wanted to wander around by myself. The train ticket also included afternoon tea at the on-site Sanctuary Lodge, and this was a most enjoyable experience. I took the Vistadome back to Cusco, and I felt more at home in this crowded train than I had in the Hiram Bingham. And here is a tip: If you are actually interested in seeing some of the landscape take the morning train to Machu Picchu when travelling in winter, as you will be travelling in the dark on the way back."

We (married couple in our early 60s) booked the Hiram Bingham train as part of our tour package in Peru; we'd heard great things about this trip and it exceeded all of our expectations! The first day we boarded the train in the Sacred Valley (at the Ollantaytambo station), and enjoyed a very tasty brunch and lots of sightseeing on our way to the town of Aguas Calientes. After an overnight stay and two-day visit to Machu Picchu we boarded again for the return trip to Cusco. The live band in the bar car was very good (even the non-drinkers said so!), and afterwards we enjoyed an excellent gourmet dinner with some new friends.Be aware that while you're free to roam the train, you'll be sitting in a dining car (I didn't find the seats to be as uncomfortable as others have mentioned). That can also make it a challenge to take photographs on both sides of the train!"

The dinner and service on the train was good. Unfortunately the train leaves the station of Agua-Caliente in the evening and it was too dark to enjoy the scenery.

Then a lovely brunch aboard using all local, organic products + good coffee and croissants. Then a nice tour of Machu Picchu with a well-informed, English speaking guide. We were with a group of about 12 so we had plenty of personal attention. The tea at the Sanctuary was nice but the hotel wasn\u2019t as impressive as I expected. I guess its main draw is that it is at the base of Machu Picchu so they can literally walk up to the gate at daybreak.The train had a three piece band aboard that played everything from the Beatles to the local music of my husband\u2019s Peruvian city so they were great. On the way back, they had all of us dancing before dinner but once dinner was over, just about everyone fell asleep on the return trip. It was a perfect day and perfect trip. \uf04a"

An unforgettable journey and we were fortunate that the line to Poroy was opened early as I feel sure that if the train had terminated at Olanta then it would not have been nearly as enjoyable and, of course, we avoided a long road journey to Cusco.My wife does not like train journeys but the Hiram Bingham proved to be the exception, so much so that this was one of the high points of her whole holiday."

The journey begins with a welcome cocktail in a special waiting lounge at the Poroy train station (about 25 min form Cusco). We were sent off by friendly, colorful Peruvian folk dancers. The train car harkens back to the days of old with luxurious interiors of wood and fine linens. The table settings in the dining cars were impeccable as was the overall service. Outside of the dining cars were a bar and observation car. A little cramped but entirely functional. Food and drink were a plenty as we traversed the Sacred Valley on the way to the Machu Picchu citadel. The views of the countryside were spectacular. A delicious three course brunch was served at 2/3 of the way to MP. The entertainment consisted of a lively, fun trio playing Latin, Peruvian and pop favorites. Not lacking for service detail, there was also a special waiting lounge for the trip home in the Agua Caliente station. There we were served appetizers and beverages accompanied by live music in an extra comfortable setting. The ride on the way back was at the end of the day so it was dark and not much scenery to be viewed. That did not dampen the spirit of the journey or the excellent service. The bar and the entertainment area was livened up a bit more than the incoming leg and snacks and beverages were served until the three course gourmet dinner was served. The Hiram Bingham service sure made the Machu Picchu experience extra special and unique being able to travel there and back in luxurious comfort."

Tips: We were a bit worried about what to wear given it's pretty upmarket, but I think you can probably get around in anything. Also, I would be wary about trying to do Machu Picchu the day you come up. If you're anything like me, you might be a bit too tipsy to manage all the stairs! Luckily we had planned to visit Machu Picchu the following day. While it was fantastic, if I did it again I would probably only do the train to Machu Picchu and not back. We were so tired after walking all day that the return trip was really a bit of a waste. Plus it's dark so you don't get the same experience as you do during the day. Overall, absolutely fantastic. Definitely give it a go if it's within your budget!"

We arrived at the station in Cusco to live entertainment, music and dancing and some coffee and snacks in a nice waiting room. Groups were split into two busses, an English speaking guide and Spanish speaking. The buses were large Mercedes vans. The guide was very informative and because of the small size were able to talk and ask questions the whole time. We had a stop on the hour plus ride to stretch legs and take pics and then arrived in Urubamba. We were greeted with mimosas and live music and shown to our table. The train was very empty, especially our car which only had 4 couple in it! There was a printed menu, with one option, but you could request changes and ommisions to the menu. The service was prompt, the food was delish and and the wine was nice. We were on the train by 10AM so we enjoyed capuccinos first. The view and music were fun and kept everyone in a happy mood and very social. We went back to the observation car after the service and it was empty except the crew, loved that. Our guide from the train was also our guide for Machu Picchu and gave us advice about our hotel and many other items. We all travelled in a bus up to M.P. together and then split into small groups with the guides. Had to wait a little while for the people checking into the Sanctuary Lodge, but our guide showed us a great place to wait and take some photos. We met back at the Sanctuary for tea (a whole buffet really) and then took a bus together back to Aguas Calientes. We stayed the night there and then took the Vistadome back the next evening. I would do it again in a heartbeat, especially with all the included admission and guide, it was well worth it."

I was not necessarily looking forward to a 3.5 hour train ride twice in one day - but I did not know! I did not know that this train is a party train in the best way! Our first hint should have been the Peruvian \"clowns\" and the costumed dancers on the platform, playing music, singing and posing happily for pictures (for free!). Get on board, place your food order and then head directly to the back. The musicians are spirited and talented (we bought their CD), the Piscos are flowing and the vibe is happy and excited. This is not a party in an over-the-top or too loud way. Just joyous. If you want quiet you certainly remain in your dining car. The scenery on the way out is amazing. Take it all in as it will be dark on the way back. After climbing around Machu Picchu in the afternoon, enjoy the lovely dinner, impeccable service and relaxing ride back. The hours fly by.I am not sure how much the ticket was as it was bought through our tour company but one of the guides said over $700 per person, round trip. Worth every penny because there was so much laughter, fun and happiness."

The cost also provided the bus ride to/from Machu Picchu and a tourguide to the ruins...his name was Renato and he was excellent!!

I'm not sure why a previous reviewer mentioned a 1.5 hour trip to the train station from Cusco. We took a car from Cusco to the station in Poroy and it was about 25-30min max from start to finish. Maybe that station wasn't available or something. Anyway, don't worry about that, its a short easy drive. Once getting on the train we settled in and began our ~3 hour journey. We hung out in our seats until we placed our orders for food and then went back to hang out in the bar/observation cars. We were in the mood for fun so we had a great time with this. They had a band playing and all the customers were singing along and enjoying drinks and each other's company. If you want to sit in peace and quiet I would recommend staying in your original seats and enjoying the trip from there. The trip itself was comfortable and the views were fantastic. We've not taken trains much for our travels and truly enjoyed this a great deal. The trip back home was great as well. The party in the bar car was a little more upbeat as there was dancing along with the music. It was a great time and we got a chance to meet so many great people from all over the world on this trip. I would highly recommend this trip to anyone who may be considering it. I know I would certainly go again if I had the chance!"

Considering how expensive this train is, the service was lacking, the staff was not courteous, the meeting staff at the Sanctuary Hotel in Machu Picchu was just terrible and everyone was in a rush during the train ride as the route was shortened due to the rainy season. Our tour company told us to be at the Sanctuary Hotel lobby at 4:00 PM to meet with the Hiram Bingham group. We arrived 10 minutes earlier and were told that the meeting time was at 4:00 PM and to wait outside until then. When we inquire again at that time, they were not ready but now \"we could enter the bar area\" and wait, just to be received by a waiter and treated as a second class citizen and placed on a corner without offering us a drink. Finally the area was ready for the group (no announcement made) just to find a cold sandwiches and juices (our daughter wanted a coke from the self-service machine and was told that it was not included, only the juices on the buffet table). Then we were told that the buses to the train station were leaving and taken to the Aguas Calientes train station. We were greeted at a special reception area at the station with live music and then assign and taken to our seats at the train. Then the train departed on time and there was when everything went downhill. We knew that the train route was shorted due to the rainy season and that bus services were arranged to our hotel in Cusco. The food was very good and cooked as ordered, the portions were small and the staff was simply rude and in a rush to get all the orders out before arriving at the station. Some tables were offered hot drinks, we were not. We wanted to order drinks for the table and were told in a very condescending manner that the drinks were extra! Please, if I have the money to pay for the train that is 4 times more expensive that the next alternative (VistaDome) and the prices are well printed on the menu, I do not have to be so rudely told that I will have to pay for my drinks. To complete the already disappointing experience, the waiter bought in the check for the drinks and just said \"in dollars\" referring that the bill had to be paid in US dollars and not in Soles. What is I had no US dollars while on Peru! My advice, take the other trains and avoid the Hiram Bingham during the rainy season, only book the train when the route is complete and perhaps you will have a different experience. We complaint to our tour company about our experience and to our surprise, they already had similar complaints from other visitors!"

After we booked the Hiram Bingham package (separate review for the Machu Picchu Sanctuary Lodge) we were informed that during rainy season the train between Cusco and Aguas Calientes was \"bimodal\" - which means that you have to take a bus or car from Cusco to the Rio Sagrado hotel in Urubama. At first I was annoyed that no one had told me this before I booked my 100% nonchangeable, nonrefundable package but really, there's nothing that Belmond (Orient Express) can do about it. The tracks are closed to passenger trains for part of the year. And don't let \"bus\" get to you too much: They are large, very comfortable upscale vans that are only used for Hiram Bingham passengers.We didn't take the Vistadome train either way, but it looks lovely and comfortable. I only mention that because if you're looking for any sort of \"value\" out of the Hiram Bingham you won't find it. It's definitely for people that want to splurge, and know that they're splurging on an overpriced service. That's fine - why not? We thought the food and wine was very good and loved the band in the bar car. Yes, it's touristy (3 piece Peruvian trio playing Gypsy Kings and Beatles while you drink a pisco sour) but so what? It was fun and indulgent, which is what it's supposed to be. Our package came with a guided tour of Machu Picchu - all the HB tickets may, not sure. Our guide, Camila, was wonderful. As you're approaching Aguas Calientes, your guide will come to your table on the train and introduce his/herself and explain logistics to you and help you navigate when you arrive. Some other folks have commented that when you stay at the Lodge, you have to check out at 11 but don't catch the shuttle to the train until 4:30. I swear - I don't get why that's a problem. You're at the footsteps of Machu Picchu. I think there might be a way to kill a few hours. Even if you didn't want to go back into the ruins, there's a nice hotel restaurant, showers, the \"day room\" with WiFi, jaccuzi and courtyard that are available to guests who have checked out and are taking the HB train home."

And another benefit is that right now they are providing a bimodal system with the last half of the trip by bus into Cusco. Without this they would end in Poroy which would be over a 30 minute taxi ride back into Cusco. With the bimodal bus, we were taken right to our hotel in Cusco.

Traveling to Machu Picchu on the Orient Express has been on my bucket list for years so I was very excited to take this train ride with my husband and 6 year old son. Sadly, our trip fell in the wet season so we had to take the bi-modal trip (bus and train). While the staff tried to offer great service, the bus was very small and cramped, with no facilities. After approximately 90 minutes, we settled into our dining car on the train and were ready to experience the luxury of the Hiram Bingham. I'm not sure what the situation was with our table but it seemed to be in the invisible zone. Every other passenger was greeted with mimosas except for us. We had to hail down the wait staff to get our drinks while other tables seemed to have constant attention. During dinner, we noticed the other tables had their second courses cleared before we received our first. When we inquired about our dinner, we received a simple salad with avocado, not the traditional Peruvian pickled vegetables promised by the menu. We refused the basic salad and, eventually, we were brought the dinner we were supposed to receive. Given that we purchased an upcharge wine instead of the house wine given with dinner, I would have expected at least the same level of service as the rest of the diners. The staff was accommodating to our 6 year old by offering pasta for lunch and a plain steak with rice for dinner instead of the set menu but the misses in the dining room really left me disappointed with the experience."

The whole experience, the food, wine, Pisco Sours was absolutely great. The service from the train attendance as well as the station staff was as you would expect from Orient Express.The second thing to note is that this was part of an overall journey we took in Peru booked and arranged through Orient Express in Charleston USA. It should be noted that the train does not operate every day so itineraries may need to be planned around the trains schedule. We chose to depart from Cusco, although the station is now in the outskirts of the city as the line into the city itself had become too dangerous due to increased road traffic. We then travelled on the train all the way to the end point having lunch on board as we went. The train is mostly made up of dining cars and at the rear of the train is a bar and observation car. There is a band that plays in the bar and this may be too noisy for some.When we travelled the train was not particularly full and there was plenty of room to move around and to take one\u2019s turn at the back of the train looking out on the scenery. The train does not run particularly quickly or smoothly but the relatively slow journey along the single track is accomplished at an appropriately leisurely pace.On arrival at the destination station travellers are then taken the last few miles up to the gates of the Machu Pichu site. Some travellers were just taking a daytrip and this seems to be entirely possible allowing for a few hours at the magnificent site before returning back to Cusco on the train.However we decided to spend a night at the Sanctury Lodge Hotel (see our trip advisor report) so were deposited at the hotel entrance and checked into the hotel. The next day in the afternoon we were collected and taken back to the train for the evening journey but as we had opted to stay in Sacred Valley at the hotel Rio Sagrado (see our trip advisor report) we departed the train at Ollie Tampa Bay Station. Again we were looked after well on this journey and as they knew we were departing the train before Cusco, the staff ensured that we were served first so that dinner was complete before our stop.It\u2019s also worth noting that the Sanctuary Lodge Hotel is right outside the gates of the Machu Picchu Park and has a separate dining room for hotel guests and those using the Hirham Bingham train service. Even though the coach system limits to some extent visitors to the site, there are still considerable numbers waiting to get into the park and waiting for their return buses to the station \u2013 most people of course will be travelling on regular trains and other tourist trains. The use of the separate dining room does allow some comfort at the site if you are not staying in the hotel. The other restaurant is really a canteen and seems to be very very crowded.Please read my other trip advisor reviews of this trip: Hotel B Arts in Lima, The Machu Picchu Sanctuary Lodge, the Palacio Nazarenas and the Hotel Rio Sagrado."

From start to finish I was always questioning what was coming next. Mostly this was due to a very confusing e-mail from Orient-Express. I started by private car, then got on a bus for 1.5 hours (conveniently stopping at an Indian market filled with eager vendors...hmmm?), we then boarded the train for a mediocre lunch. At one point I commandeered my own hand luggage since I had no idea what was happening with that. I eventually landed at the Sanctuary Lodge. And here's the downside to the HB train/overnight package: you are out of your room at 11am and the bus down the mountain to board the train does not leave until 4:45pm. On the return \"something\" fell on the tracks and we were herded on to buses in the dark for yet another 1.5 hour spit and jerk drive. The whole adventure makes Mr. Toads Wild ride look lame."

The train itself is a time warp as it is reminiscent of the original Orient Express. Service wise, everyone was very attentive and kind. Moreover, they explain the history of the sites BRIEFLY throughout the ride. One thing they should have notified us is that you need to bring your passport to Machu Picchu, which would have saved us lots of haggling at the entrance. The facilities are in the same vein as the fa\u00e7ade, but if they could recline, they would be a lot better. Wi-fi somewhere in the train would be lovely too. My favorite part is the panoramic car in the back from which you can take great photos. Overall a great experience. Whatever you do, don't take a bus from Cusco to Machu Picchu."

The rear open air observation car is an exceptional experience. The trip comes with a guided tour of Machu Picchu in Spanish or English. Unfortunately, the return is at night when it is too dark to appreciate the scenery, but the onboard musicians and dinner service make it worthwhile. Pisco sours and other drinks are included. The only drawback is the boring bus ride from the train back to Cusco."

Off the bat, yes it is pricey, but we did one-way which helps the with cost if needed (we did dinner). The train leaves directly from the Machu Picchu train station, which is nice and makes the experience a little easier. There is only one train a day to Cusco. Due to the rainy season part of the track was washed out and we had to take a bus the rest of the way- otherwise the train would have gone directly to Cusco, which is about 3 hours. The first class service starts at the door when you walk into the train station lobby; wet clothes to wash hands, free cocktails and other drinks, many comfortable places to sit. All the attendants and train staff were so kind and helpful. There is a bar car with live music and all you can drink cerveza and pisco-sours (yes, they are delicious-TRY ONE). We danced and drank for the first 45 minutes. Dinner was served in an elegantly decorate dining car (and your reserved seat) with fresh flowers and top notch place settings. The food was MUCH better than I expected for a train meal. The food was wonderful and paired with wines. Plenty off food, and I'm a hungry one. The train was a fantastic experience and if you have the capability to go, it's well worth it and so much fun."

It was dark outside while we traveled on the Hiram Bingham, so it felt that much more romantic. The bar car was fantastic with live music, dancing and the best drink EVER, the Pisco Sour. Dinner was very good. The whole experience was so Agatha Christie. Loved it. Can't recommend it highly enough. And, of course, you cant overlook the wonderful staff.

It does feel a bit over the top, but it's oh so comfortable and well arranged. The train is the last of the trains to leave Cusco, so you can sleep a little later, and (I believe) the last to leave MP. As has been mentioned, this means you'll be one of the last leaving MP, which hopefully gives you some breathing room as it can get quite crowded. From white cloth dining, to live music in the bar car, to well spoken guides (although I must point out that our guide just had it in for Hiram Bingham - the explorer. Constant railing on how he wasnt one thing or another.). Yes it costs more and yes it's a great way to see MP."

We took the Vistadome train in the morning to Machu Picchu and then the Hiram Bingham train back to the Sacred Valley in the evening after spending the night at the Machu Picchu Sanctuary Lodge. Though it was dark outside while we traveled on the Hiram Bingham, we had already enjoyed the views on the way out and we were able to focus on the wonderful experience of riding the train itself. What a beautiful experience! It began at the train station where we all waited in the private Orient-Express lounge. While waiting, three musicians played beautiful Andean music while champagne was served to the guests. The train itself is well maintained with polished wood and brass and lovely white table cloths and linens. We were seated at a beautiful table in the dining car, handed some delicious Pisco Sours, and then encouraged to enjoy the live music in the bar until dinner time. For those people who opted not to visit the bar, they were really missing out! The three musicians (guitar, vocals and drum) were truly delightful! They played the traditional Andean music, as well as everything from The Beatles to Elvis Presley! They loved having audience participation and encouraged everyone to clap and sing and dance. It was great fun! We loved seeing the waiters, the bar tenders and other staff members dancing along while serving the drinks. It really was so worth it!The dinner was delicious - several courses - served with great care and polish. Shortly after the end of our wonderful meal, we arrived back in the Sacred Valley. The time passed so quickly! I highly recommend the Hiram Bingham. It's a delightful experience!"

In case you want to do it more relaxed ( I recomend it ) stay overnight in the Machu Picchu area ( down at Aguas Calientes or at the only hotel by the ruins up the mountain ). In this case you can either travel to and back with the Hiram Bingham or take the Vistadome train to go from Cusco or the Sacred Valley to Machu Picchu and return on the Hiram Bingham. You will save some money this way.You get a reserved seat at the dining carriage and you can move around to the saloon and bar carriage.

It's a short walk with a few steps to get to the busses. You walk through a pretty horrid tourist sales area. Don't buy anything - it's all overpriced.The trip home is where the train really shines. You will take a bus back to Aguas Calientes and board the train after some time in the waiting room. They serve nice drinks while you wait. You will get a similar seat for a 4-course dinner. The food was good, not great. But after you drink your Pisco Sour, make sure you head back to the bar car. The musicians there were fantastic. Really amazing. They had a couple of guitarists and a drummer, and they are all vocalists. They ran through a bunch of Peruvean and Spanish songs. They had everyone clapping, playing instruments, drinking, and even dancing. It was a TON of fun. We spent an hour there, and the time flew.While you are in the bar car, you will get more drinks and some salty snacks along with some sushi and potato appetizers. Very good overall.The rest of the meal was a good meal. There was nothing remarkably great or bad about it. The dessert was noticeably good. The ride back is quite long. You are scheduled to arrive at 9:15p. If you spent the day in Machu Picchu, I would change into comfortably nice clothes before the train ride. There is a bathroom on the train, so no worries there. You will likely be sleeping at your table for a bit if your visit was like ours - everyone on the train was nodding off. Dress in layers as the train was warmer than we expected, but then got cooler throughout the night. Overall, this was worth it for us. It might be on the pricey side for many, but there is no better train to ride to Machu Picchu for sure."

From the reception to the comfort of the seating, the food, the service and the entertainment. But not only the train ride but the immediate availability of the transport buses for the transport up to Machu Picchu at the arrival of the train in Aguas Calentes, and the way the luggage was handled so that you find it back in the evening in the hotel at check in, was outstanding. The guide that Orient Express provided at Machu Picchu was also great, Alex made the afternoon very interesting and enjoyable. And the last part of the deal, the afternoon tea gave us the opportunity for a good rest after the visit.Very pleased with the whole package.We went both ways with the Hiram Bingham and we can only highly recommend it."

The service was impeccable! The band was so much fun - they are all so incredibly talented and they clearly love what they do. We were celebrating our wedding anniversary, and they went to the trouble to find out what our \"song\" was before the trip - they learned it for us and played it for us on the train. This was such a special moment - it almost brought my husband to tears!!!! We will never forget this amazing day. The food and drinks were amazingb as well. Neither one of us wanted to get off the train! Sure, it is an expensive train ride, but it is NOTHING when you consider what you get for what you pay - an amazing, historic train ride on a beautiful train, fantastic entertainment, gourmet food and delicious drinks, entrance into Machu Picchu, guided tour of machu picchu, afternoon tea at the machu picchu sanctuary lodge, and round trip tickets up and down the mountain from Aguas Calientes to Machu Picchu, not to mention memories that will last you forever. It is absolutely worth EVERY penny. I would do it again and again and again. If you're going to go all the way to Machu Picchu, you might as well do it right and go on the Hiram Bingham! You will not regret it."

For our 20th wedding anniversary we decided to spend our week at Cusco, and my wife had a special gift for me, which was a trip to Machu Picchu on board of this great Hiram Bingham train, I had to tell it has been one of the best trips ever, very romantic and pleasant, all of the crew was fantastic, among the cars and obviously the trip itself, the landscapes are breathtaking! The crew had prepared our table with rose petals and champagne to celebrate our day. The panoramic car had a folkloric band on board playing beautiful music while we could enjoy an open bar, offering from hot beverages, snacks and all sort of spirits. After a while we had a 5 star restaurant lunch, amazing combinations of flavors. The service was amazing. Once we got to the final destination at Aguas Calientes we took a bus to Machu Picchu, which was a total complete experience (will write about it later), after the visit they were waiting for us with a buffet to wait for the bus to return to the train. The trip back to Cusco was even better, we enjoyed a romantic dinner at our table and then celebrated with the rest of the people enjoying live music on the panoramic car, everyone singing and playing an instrument, was amazing! If anyone who is looking for a special place to celebrate a great occasion like this I will completely recommend this experience."

The observation car at the end of the train was a fantastic place to take fantastic photos of the incredible scenery along the way. We took the Expedition train on the way back and were very frustrated to have to take pictures through windows and skylights. With the Hiram Bingham, the back of the observation car is open to the air and is a fantastic spot to take pictures from. Second, you get to experience the sort of train ride that our grandparents might have experienced on one of the fancy European trains in a bygone era - service impeccable, furnishings historic and beautiful, relaxed enjoyment of the scenery passing by. Third, if you take the train to MP, you get transportation from the train station up to Machu Picchu, which costs $18.50 per person just for the bus ride. Plus, you get a private tour of the ruins and tea at the Sanctuary Lodge. The private tour was fantastic. There were only six or eight of us on the tour, as they provided several guides for that day's train. There were tours in English and Spanish. The tour guide was knowledgeable and friendly and we definitely felt that when the three hour tour was over that it was well worth it."

The train leaves the Poroy station (about 30 minute ride in a cab from Cusco) and takes you to Aguas Calientes station (30 minute shuttle ride to the Machupicchu entrance). The train ride takes about 3.5 hours each way.The fare included shuttle ride up to Machupicchu, entry ticket, tour guide, and brunch, tea buffet at the Lodge in Machupicchu, dinner and drinks. The way there was amusing with the train ride and all but the fun wore off on the way back. It was dark and couldn't see anything outside which made the train ride seem like an eternity. There was a group drinking at the bar car and seemed to have a great time as they were annoyingly rowdy. Maybe I should have too... but felt tired from the trip.Food was not too bad but I think it could have been better. Considering that it's done on a moving train, it's understandable. The decor was nice but the cars looked like they needed an update. The upholstery looked worn and dingy and didn't scream luxury. If you haven't done this trip, by all means do it. It's a unique experience and worth doing it but I'll find a cheaper/faster way to get there next time."

They played many Latin classics and the party was on. All of us were dancing the whole time as the champagne flowed. They ended with a Beatles sing along that had everyone singing and dancing. Afterwards we enjoyed a great gourmet dinner. We made many friends that we kept running into in Cusco at different hotels,shops and just walking in the streets. We will never forget this part of our trip. Carlos C"

When our fish dinner was served, it immediately smelled fummy to me. I suggested my husband not eat it as well, but he insisted, and exactly 3 hours later was deathly ill. He totally missed Cusco as he could not be away from the bathroom. The train itself is lovely, and the atmosphere was fun, but we learned a hard lesson about the food."

The bar car entertainment that made the trip fly by. My only comment would, be that on trips where there are families with smaller children I would suggest they use both dining cars as to allows those of us who wish to dine without having children running down the train pulling on the table clothes etc. The management did the very best they could to encourage parents to monitor the behavior. Overall a terrific experience and the only way to go."

We went to Machu Picchu for part of our honeymoon so we decided to splurge on the Hiram Bingham train since our trip was more adventurous and we wanted one luxury experience. We absolutely loved this train! When you first arrive at the station in the morning you get tea or coffee and pastries. There while waiting to board there are musicians and dancers.The train itself is a fun first class experience. Many alcoholic drinks are complimentary. There are lots of delicious snacks. The drink car is a fun place to hang out and right next to the drink car is the caboose which has windows all around the sides and top for great views (and the views are spectacular heading up the mountains!) On the way up they have the very back of this car wide open so you can enjoy the fresh air and scenery.We LOVED the musicians aboard. Those of us who spent time in the last 2 cars had quite a dance party while the musicians played local music, and songs like La Bamba and Jail House Rock (in Spanish). Everyone took turns dancing; it was so fun!Our actual assigned seats and table were so beautiful. We had delicious 3 course meals on the journey there and back, we loved all the food. We got special champagne with hearts in the glasses for our honeymoon! They had amazing food (my husband enjoyed duck appetizers, fish dinners, etc) and wonderful vegetarian options I enjoyed (a nice change from usual vegetarian options of veggies and rice--these were first class meals!)It was such a wonderful experience--if you are considering taking the Hiram Bigham train to Machu PIcchu--do it! You will not regret spending a little extra to have a great time!!!!"

The staff were wonderfully attentive on August 15th on the ride to Macchu Pitcchu. They got the singers to perform some songs i love everyone sang happy birthday and qi was given a beautiful leatherbound jounal as a bithday giftfrom the company. This was a complete surprise for me and such an appropriate gift as I am a writer. The tour with Veronica was wonderful. We all missed the tea time as my mther rested in theroom and my husband and i stayed on at the citadel until closing.We spent a night in Sanctuary Lodge and the following night in Aguas Calientes returning on the Hiram Bingham train to Cusco. The return trip was no where near as good as the first. Perhaps the staff were more busy. I drank all four glasses of water at my table andhad to demand from a waiter that i begiven more. I was feeling as though I might feint, so was actually panicking when the water wasnot brought in a reasonable amount of time.Wenever met the maitre'd on the returntripwhereas on the way down the maitre'd introduced himself to each guest. It made me wish we had done our roundtrip in one day.As we returned twodays later,it would have suited us better to leave in the day. We had to be out of our hotel by 10 a.m. but the train doesn't leave until the evening. We became over tired and had to sleep but of course could not stretch out. I think if you don't doit all in one day, pyou might as well take a less expensive train for your return. Of course travelling by day affords you beautiful views you can't get at night."

The meal was decent but avoid the wines! The best thing is that the timing of the train means that travellers reach Macchu Picchu in the afternoon so the site is much less crowded than in the mornings. Passengers are also nannied so that everything is very smooth, from leaving the train to re-bording later, post-visit.One tip, we were advised to stay at the Inkaterra Hotel overnight but this was not really necessary as we had a very thorough tour of Macchu Picchu which lasted 3 hours. So, advice would be to do a return on the same day on the Hiram Bingham. Remember, the return trip is usually in the dark so no views."

Also, we were lucky, as a mudslide had closed it down for several weeks, and it only re-opened two days earlier. Additionally, we had great weather, and the train was only 1/4 full. Perhaps this helped make it such an amazing experience, although I note that many others have had similarly good experiences. Standing in the open car at the back as it rolls slowly through the countryside makes you feel as though you are traveling in style as it was done 100 years ago. Additionally, all the food, music, drink, and entertainment is just superb. Coming back at night from Machu Picchu, however, was much less entertaining as it was dark and everyone was tired, so strongly suggest you get outward bound leg from Cusco and not just the return (as most of the passengers seemed to have done). A wonderful experience and strongly recommended."

So, if I were basing this review solely on our personal experience with the HB train, I might give it 4*s based on a few issues we encountered the day before our trip: 1) the Cusco station was closed which meant the train actually left from the Sacred Valley. Buses were provided to get people to the Sacred Valley (about an hour and a half), but a bus isn't quite the same as the train, right? 2) We discovered that we couldn't bring our luggage on the train; only carry-ons that were around 8kg or less. This caused a few headaches as the train was one piece of a much bigger Peruvian puzzle that made up our honeymoon.Those two minor issues aside, this was a pretty awesome experience. You can take a public train to Machu Picchu for a fraction of the cost, I'm sure, but the Hiram Bingham transports you in style. It goes about 10mph, giving guests views of the scenery from Urubamba to Aguas Calientes. We had a three course lunch provided, complimentary wines, champagne, beer and pisco sours, plus live music from the observation cart.The service was great and staff delivered all messaging in Spanish and in English. The seats are comfy and in true Orient-Express fashion, every thing is done to the nines, delivering old world charm and a cozy environment. When we got off the train, we immediately jumped on buses that transported us up to the gates of Machu Picchu (seamless transition for which I have to give them props). In addition to transportation services, the trip included a guide for the park. Our guide, Nery, was incredible! Our trip to Machu Picchu wouldn't have been the same without her guidance and knowledge so the guide was a wonderful addition for us.All in all, it was a wonderful addition to our Peruvian excursion. If you just want to get from Point A to Point B, this isn't the train for you. If you want an experience in and of itself with great service, great food and an all around memorable time, this is hard to beat!"

Nobody knows when it will re-open. So if you plan to take this trip, check first whether you will get what you pay for, as it is a very expensive dinner on wheels.(written 6 July 2013)"

            "review": "Best way to get to Machu Picchu. This was a wonderful experience. We scheduled private transfers to and from the Hotel Monasterio by Orient Express. It was flawless. Our guide, Darwing, and our driver picked us up and drove us safely to the train station, about 1:20 hour drive. They got us on board where we were treated to Mimosas, champagne or pisco sours. We placed our brunch order and went to the observation car. So pretty. The train is very nice. You travel in style and eat delicous food served on white linens. You then get on a private bus and head up to Machu Picchu. No waiting in line for bus tickets or park tickets. All are included. What a drive. You are then met by your private guide who then tours you through the ruins. You cannot imagine how breath taking the views are. The guides will go slow if you are having trouble catching your breath. Wear sturdy shoes, sneakers or boots. Also, it was very hot and we had been cold everywhere else in South America. Try to dress in layers. You will get sun burned to take some sun screen. After our tour, we headed to the Sanctuary Lodge for tea. We had wonderful food. Then back to the bus to head down to the train. We had drinks in the waiting area of the train station, then got on board and ordered dinner. We then headed to the bar car for a festive time. Everyone on board was singing with the wonderful musicians and having a great time partying after their adventure. We then had a delicious meal and our escorts were waiting for us at the station. We were driven safely and comfortably back to our hotel. This is the best way to travel to Machu Picchu. In style and ultimate comfort. Orient Express is the best managed travel group that I have ever encountered. Everyone associated with them goes above and beyond to make sure you are safe and pampered. Everyone seems to really love their job and you can sense the pride they feel at being associated with such a fine company. You will thank yourself for having the good sense to book with Orient Express. Definitely the highlight of our South American trip."

You can see the country side. Your own bus to Machu Picchu with tour. The guides are excellent. High tea at the Sanctuary. You can stay overnight if you wish. I suggest the Sanctuary as you can go to Machu for a final self tour (need to purchase a second ticket). The light is beautiful and there are not too many people. You can take the Hiram bus down. Your luggage is all handled. The hotel room is basic but it is an unique experience with excellent food (all included)', good wine (included)."

It took me a while to settle down after we boarded the train; like most travelers, we were on a whirlwind tour of South America. But eventually, I slowed down and appreciated the elegant dining and bar cars. My favorite car was the open ended observation car where a trio of musicians provided the perfect soundtrack of Peruvian music. It is the best place to view the magical scenery, snow capped mountains and occasionally farms, villages and villagers. The food is Restaurant quality and the staff was surprisingly accommodating to special requests."

The train is beautiful, and meal, while not really restaurant quality, was certainly acceptable, and service was excellent. The train portion was exceptional, and we had a wonderful time.The problem is, during May & June, there was a problem with the tracks, and thus instead of the normal 4 hour ride, we got 2 hours on a train - 2 hours on a bus. We were emailed on this a month ago, but were told there would be no price adjustment, no refund option, and no exchange option. Basically it was accept it or loose the money. This is kind of like buying a 7 day cruise, and then being told (in advance) you will be spending 3 days at a Holiday Inn instead of the ship, and oh yes - sorry, no refund or no adjustment. Sorry, but I simply found that unacceptable."

I was really glad we had made that decision. The excitement and anticipation of heading up to the marvel of Machu Picchu is heightened by the luxurious train ride. The service and food were spectacular. The music referred to was back in the observation car, and was especially fun on our trip because a large group of Portugese/Brazilian company executives/wives joined in the singing and dancing. We were disappointed to find out the week before travelling that part of the tracks were still not open after the rainy season and that the first hour and a half were on a bus. Though I must add that it was a very nice Mercedes van with only a few travelers from Cusco to Rio Sagrada where we boarded the train. The special touches begin as soon as check-in and continue right through with a guided tour of the ruins followed by afternoon tea at the Sanctuary Hotel. We were staying overnight, and our guide was very helpful to get us to our hotel and checked in before re-boarding the train with guests returning that evening. The next day, after hiking/climbing up the very steep Huayna Picchu, we took the afternoon Vistadome back to Cusco. It was certainly nice enough, and we were probably too tired to have fully enjoyed the Hiram Bingham experience on the return."

On our return from Machu Picchu, the train ended again at Rio Sagrado, and we had a pleasant coach drive back to Cusco. The train, itself, made us feel like we were travelers in the 19th century. Definitely Orient-Express if ever we saw it! Very good meals both ways, extraordinary service, and very comfortable rides.

We had been booked on the Hiram Bingham for at least 6 months prior to our trip but received no communication from either the Orient Express or the Hiram Bingham management team that, due to a landslide that had damaged the track close to Pisac, that the Hiram Bingham train would overcome this operational difficulty by departing/terminating at the Rio Salgrado Hotel rather than Poroy. This greatly reduces the trip to Machu Picchu on board this excellent train.We loved the train with its comfortable seats, wonderful atmosphere and high quality lunch/dinner. However, the boarding process was poor and we would warn future travellers to expect an element of inconvenience, discomfort and annoyance on the journey to and from Wanchaq Train Station and the Rio Salgrado until the Hiram Bingham management get to grips with their operational problems.We checked in at Wanchaq Train Station at 7:30am and were asked to retain our luggage. It was obviously a busy time for the staff as they were also trying to board and despatch the Andean Explorer at the same time. We found two comfortable seats in the well-decorated waiting room and enjoyed a cup of coffee while listening to an Andean Folk Group watching the departure of the Andean Explorer.This train departed at 8:00am leaving some 14 to 15 Hiram Bingham passengers waiting. We were given no further information until at around 8:30am it became obvious that the Hiram Bingham management staff had disappeared and a tour guide suddenly urged us all to hurry and board the bus - and bring our luggage.The bus was an ordinary tour van - not a luxury coach. We were sat at the back of this vehicle and were bounced around. There did not seem to be any AC working and as there was no microphone we could not hear any of the 20 minute briefing on Machu Picchu given by the guide. Half way to the Rio Salgrado we stopped for a drink at the viewpoint high above the Sacred Valley and here we discovered where the Hiram Bingham management were - they had all caught the first bus. This was a brief and hurried stop before we set off to reach the Rio Salgrado.Access to the hotel was limited by the Hiram Bingham Train being positioned at the entrance. Again we were told to hurry off the bus taking our luggage and form a queue to check-in - again. Here came the annoyance - waiting in the hot sun to check-in for a second time and seeing the check-in staff giving priority and allowing tour groups to push in ahead of the individual travellers. They seemed to be also dominating the seating allocation. To make it worse, we were asked to squash up against a wall to allow a tour bus to pass. We ended up in different seats and I had to insist on receiving baggage receipts for our luggage.If this first experience of the Hiram Bingham was frustrating and annoying, the next part was fantastic. The scenery as we passed up the Sacred Valley was terrific and everybody would appreciate the comfort; food and entertainment. This was the quality of the Orient Express.On arrival at Machu Picchu Town, we again witnessed the priority given to the tour groups as the individual travellers were held back and delayed. It seemed strange since it was these individuals who were to stay at the Orient Express Sanctuary Lodge overnight.It was a similar experience on the way back to Cuzco the next day. Everybody was told to be ready to leave from in front of the Sanctuary Lodge at 4:45pm. The Sanctuary Lodge staff had checked-in our luggage. It was a bit of a scrummage to get on one of the 4 coaches that transported everybody down the winding track from Machu Picchu to the town to board the Hiram Bingham with again the tour guide trying to organise in favour of their customers.At the train station, again there was a queue and the boarding staff giving preference to the tour groups. I was angered when, having reached the head of the queue, the manager i/c boarding reached over us and the couple behind to check in another passenger.Again the trip on the train back to the Rio Salgrado was excellent and a great experience but then it was collecting the luggage in darkness and a long trip back to the main rail station in Cuzco in a cramped bus with the luggage on our laps arriving after 10:00pm.My advice to the Orient Express is to review how it is managing their current operational problem and recognise that they should be offering a luxury experience from start to finish; that they should treat all their customers equally and the value of communicating to their customers."

Part of the thrill of using these trains is looking at the glorious scenery the train travels through, I would suggest if you want this use the train to go to MP not the return.The major problem for the train at the moment is that due to a landslide you only go for half the journey to Cusco, you have to leave the train halfway and continue your journey by road. This made service for dinner somewhat of a rush. They didn't start serving the meal until one hour into the journey and some people did not finish their meal before they were being asked to get off. One assumes this problem will disappear once they have cleared the line, however I would ckeck this before you book."

The staff on the train couldn't have been more professional and just plain nice. When we returned to Cusco, they made sure there was a taxi waiting for us to take us back to our hotel.

Fantastic lunch with loads of wine, while the train chugs along the beautiful country side and the flowing Urubamba river. The guides provided are excellent and we stayed overnight at Macchu Picchu but you can make it a round trip on the same day. We returned the next day and were treated to a gourmet dinner and alive band and dancing on the way back to Cusco. It is definitely worth the steep price you pay for the journeyPlease note that there is very little space for luggage so the company gives you a small hand luggage for you clothes ."

The first time I went to Machu Picchu I went on the Vista Dome train (May 2011), but on my second time to Macchu Picchu (April 2013) I had the chance to go on the journey with HB train and there is no comparison. The service, the tables, the food, the bar, the musicians, everything is flawless! I have no idea how they manage to do it, but if you would like to rest from all the music and dancing going on the bar wagon, the noise does not even reach the nearest table to the bar."

At the station in the morning you are welcomed by musicians and dancers, before buses take you to the Hiram Bingham starting point (which due to a recent landslide was at Urabamba). On board, it's gourmet dining, delightful Peruvian wines, beers and sparkling wine, not to mention the Pisco Sours. In the observation car/bar at the rear of the train, more musicians entertain the travellers as the scenery of the Sacred Valley slides past at a leisurely pace.On arrival at Aguascalientes, buses and take you and your guides to Machu Picchu at a time when the main tourist hordes are leaving for the day. When you have had enough, it's high tea on top of the mountain before heading downhill for the very comfortable return journey with a five-course gourmet dinner, more entertainment, and wines.It's not cheap, but we loved it.

The staff were attentive, the food imaginative and delicious, and the bar where Pisco sours were on the house was lively and fun. We ended up jiving to the Peruvian band (nothing to do with the Pisco sours!) and then watching all the fantastic rugged peaks, fast flowing rivers and the Peruvian people from the open air carriage. Much more expensive than the Andean Express that we later took to Puno, but it is right up there on the \"must do\" list!"

Be aware that Peru Rail has currently shortened all of its trains to Machu PIcchu to include a long bus ride from Cusco due to track conditions. This has the most impact on the Bingham as it eliminates 1hr+ of quality time of the train (in our case after dinner coffee/drinks, socializing).We opted for the Bingham for our return from MP (took vistadome up which was just fine), probably not worth the big price premium given the short trip."

Although we considered the other options to get to Machu Picchu, what finally made us decide to take the Hiram Bingham train was that it left later than the other trains (9:05 a.m.) It turned out to be a luxurious- and expensive-choice. Upon arriving at the station which is about 20 minutes from Cusco, we were greeted by a troupe of local dancers in costumes doing traditional dancers. We were then escorted on to the train and shown to our table. The only caveat is that most likely someone in your group will be riding backwards since you are seated at tables rather than traditional forward-facing seats. As soon as the train started we were asked for our lunch order. Since I am a very picky eater, I was not happy with the standard choices, but was offered other simple dishes that were satisfactory. The train ride itself is pleasant enough; the scenery interesting but not spectacular. There was entertainment in the bar car, which was enjoyable. The 3 1/2 hour trip passed quickly. We were assigned to a young woman who would be our guide in Machu Picchu and she was fantastic. Her enthusiasm was contagious and her knowledge absolutely made the day for us. After the tour of Machu Picchu we were taken to the Sanctuary Hotel for a lovely late afternoon tea. The food was quite good. We then returned to Aguas Calientes to get the return train to Cusco. Unfortunately, on the return, there was a mud slide on the tracks and our train was delayed about 40 minutes before they could clear the tracks. This supposedly happens fairly frequently during the rainy season and is simply a force of Nature that can't be controlled. We happened to see some of the other trains during our ride and they were absolutely packed with passengers. Although the Backpacker and Expedition trains are much less expensive than the Hiram Bingham, they can't be nearly as comfortable or pleasant. The Hiram Bingham train is an experience in its own right, not just a way to get to Machu Picchu."

It's the last train of the day - so you get to spend the longest time at the Citadel. We took the \"Backpacker\" train to Aguas Calientes the previous day which was just fine. We stayed the night at the Sanctuary Lodge next to Machu Picchu. The lodge serves afternoon tea prior to leaving for the Hiram Bingham train. The tea should not be missed - it is delicious. Then there is a special bus just for the folks taking this train to take you back down the hill to the train station. There is a separate lounge at the station for the folks taking this train as well. The sun was just setting as we got on the train. On the way to Machu Picchu the scenery is stunning, so what's inside the train is not so important -- we found the basic train to be just fine. On the way back - you really can't see much out of the windows which makes what's going on inside the train even more important. It is beautifully restored with gleaming polished wood and brass. Your dining tables are set with glass and place settings. A delicious meal is served - several choices available. The local tout and steak choices were perfectly cooked - better than most we've had in the nicer steakhouses in the US. The bar car had great, energetic music and dancing. We had great fun dancing, singing and drinking a few whiskey sours. The Peruvian band that played was incredible - really got everyone loosened up and talking. We met some great people from all over the world - even exchanged addresses with some. The staff on the train were exceptionally well-trained and accommodating. Definitely worth the price - especially on the way back!"

The carriages were all decked out for dinner and staff resplendent in their uniforms. During the course of the journey we were served drinks, entrees, mains and desert accompanied by a selection of wines. An impressive affair and a very pleasant way to spend a few hours travelling with family and friends. The band played on further down the train where you could join in and dance. As a finale farewell they meandered through the train playing as they went.All in all a very pleasant way to wind up a day in Machu Pichu."

We found the customer service manager (we assume this was his role), was rude and marred our first impressions of the train. Seating allocated on your ticket is not adhered to. Javier (the customer service manager) stated we could not have a table for two as the train was \"fully\" booked. We stood our ground, and after 10 minutes, were allowed to sit at a table for two. The train was not full as he had stated, and throughout the journey he made a point of ignoring us.Opting to take the Hiram Bingham is a once in a lifetime opportunity for some people. The experience would have been wonderful expect for this particular staff member. Perhaps travelling each day on the train, he has forgotten that for visitors, it is an experience that they have been looking forward to for a long time."

We loved it.BUT, if you want to hike any of the peaks....wayna pichu or machu pichu make sure you get the additional tickets from Hiram bingham itself, you cannot add it later at Aqua calientes. They are not at all flexible. We took the Hiram bingham train ans wanted to hike up Wayna pichu. We thought its only another $10...anybody should be able to add it to our existing tickets of $380. but NO.... we were not able to hike to wayna pichu.

Also, we had a bad experience and broke down late at night in a canyon. It took several hours to get another engine, and the conductor kept promising that it was right around the corner. I can understand the mechanical blunder, but the communications were terrible. Would we use it again...maybe, because we also stayed at the Sancturario Hotel up top in Machu Piccu, and the transition busses and baggage handling were seamless."

However my partner and I took the train both there and back on the same day, and so my recommendation would be to take it there only. The trip out is during the day with plenty to see as the scenery changes from urban to rural to mountainous. Also the back of the train has a cute balcony where you can take in the sights outdoors. Coming back they hook up the locomotive to the BACK of the train and so the balcony is out of use. Also the night trip affords very little by way of scenery due to the extreme darkness. The train moves really slowly, and other than the food and band, there's not that much to do on board. The food was decent but by no means the same standard as some of the wonderful restaurants we ate at in Peru. The guide was excellent. She was extremely patient and professional and knew so much about the Incas and the legends of Machu Picchu. It was without doubt the highlight of our trip."

After being told by our travel agent in Florida that we were booked on the Hiram Bingham Train (ran by the Orient Express), we were excited and our expectation was high. We got to the Poroy train station right around 7 AM on November 24, 2012 and we were not allowed on the train until past 8 AM. There was plenty of fanfare- music and dancing done by the locals in colorful costumes. We were assigned to table 18 on the car below the kitchen. We met a young lady next table who was traveling alone from Jakarta, Indonesia. She was an a software engineer and a writer (she said she had written two books lately). We got along well with her since my husband was, also, a computer engineer.She was sitting with a gentleman from Berlin, Germany who was going to Miami, Florida in 2 weeks. We were from Florida so we gave him some tips about Miami. We told the Indonesian lady that she was free to join us in Machu Picchu since we had a private guide assigned to us when we got there. We were told that brunch would be served around 11 AM. We picked a lot of passengers when the train stopped at the Ollantaytambo station. Twelve of those passengers sat by us in tables for 4 (total of 3 tables). They had a tour guide with them who talked very loudly in German and Spanish that it was difficult to carry on a conversation with my husband. We could not even hear the announcement on the train. Soon, they started serving drinks - juices, coffee, tea - then slices if bread with butter. Then, our entree came- some diced sweet potatoes and a rolled spinach filled with ground lamb. We both do not like lamb. When one of the waiters came around, we asked if we could possibly have something else like soup. He just waved his hand, walked away and said we could not have anything else. When we looked around, the Germans on the next 3 tables by us were having soup. We were not offered anything else to eat so we ate the diced sweet potatoes and pieces of bread with butter. That was our brunch! With the amount of money we paid, we felt that we should have been offered something else to eat. They were in a hurry and did not seem to care. We noticed that those in bigger groups were catered to. The waiters were always in a hurry. Some of them did not even make eye contact with us.Snacks and drinks were served at the Tampu restaurant outside Machu Picchu station on the way back. The food served there was better. We felt that we were treated well at Tampu Restaurant. When it was time to check in for the return trip, we were in line first. The Maitre D (Henry) checked my husband in and then me. I heard Henry said Table 12 (in Spanish) to the guide/waiter. I was expecting to be back in table 18 but since we were assigned to table 12, I kept quiet. We asked Jean Paul if he would allow us to sit with the Indonesian lady and he said that we could not sit with her. She would sit with a family of 3. We passed Table 12 and we kept on to the other car. After we were seated for a few minutes, he told us that we had to move to the next table. The lady he sat on our table (she was with a gentleman) said she was sorry that we had to move. My husband and I did not know the reason for us being moved. Shortly after that, we were told that we had to move again. That really got me irritated and asked why we were moving again. He said that he was trying to sit us near our Indonesian friend. Later, I looked for her and could not find her. She was seated with another lady towards the restaurant end. The appetizers were served and I did not feel like eating. However, the lady who served the appetizers was probably the friendliest among the staff members. She interacted with the passengers. She even offered second helping of the gazpacho. They served small slices of dark meat (duck) which my husband said did not taste good. We did not go to the bar or the observation car where the band was playing.Just before we got to Poroy Station where we got off, Henry came to our table to apologize and gave us a cap and a small brown journal. I took them just so he would not be embarrassed. My husband and I were both upset. We were very disappointed with the Hiram Bingham. Our tour guide in Machu Picchu said that we could have taken the Vistadome which was a lot cheaper and just as good."

            "review": "\"Excellent to a point\". The point in question was 8.30 pm on our return journey back to Cusco after a supurb day on the train and at Machu Picchu. The quality of the train, food, service, guide and afternoon tea at the Sanctuary Lodge Hotel were all first class, as one would expect from the Orient Express company.However, where they failed to come up to expectations was after dinner on the homeward trip when just over an hour away from Cuzco the train stopped and we were advised of a landslide ahead, with an estimated delay of an hour, or possibly less! Two hours later and without any further interim communications regarding progress we were told that for safety reasons, even though the track had been cleared, we were now going back to the station we had left approximately three hours earlier. Transport was to be organised from there to get us back to Cuzco by road.On arrival back at Ollantaytambo at around midnight and after being led to the carpark across the tracks by torchlight, as the train didn't actually stop at a platform, we were informed that it was our responsibility to arrange onward transport home. Following some tense moments and associated strong words from one of our fellow lady Australian travellers, taxis were eventually found. Five of us crammed into the car designed for four and one and a half uncomfortable hours later we arrived back at our Cuzco hotel at 1.45pm.Whilst one accepts problems such as the landslip can arise, not however an unusual occurrence in Peru, the lack of contigency planning by Orient Express and their very poor level of communications were more akin to British Rail on a bad day. Not the sort of experience you expect having paid around \u00a31500 for a day out! As with many things you only find out how good a company really is when something goes wrong. Orient Express failed the test on this occasion and definately needs to improve.If you want an extremely good rail journey try Peru Rail's Andean Explorer to Lake Titicaca. Excellent value for money and with entertainment far better than the Hiram Bingham. Everything else is pretty good too, especially the food and service."

The dining car was so comfortable and the service could not have been better. All the serve staff were friendly and prompt with refills on our drinks. We thoroughly enjoyed the entertainment and the atmosphere in the observatory car.Our guide, Breytzi Astocaza, was so well-informed on Machu Pichu. She gave us a great tour of Machu Pichu, and we know so much more about the ruins now than before we went. She also let us go at our own pace. We never felt rushed.The personnel on the Hiram Bingham were so attentive to our needs. Breytzi made sure we didn't miss the entertainment in the observatory car on our way back to Cusco, and it was well worth it.The four-hour train ride went by so fast because we were enthralled by the elegance of the train and the friendliness and efficiency of its personnel."

I didn't do much research before boarding this train as it was arranged as part of our Peru tour by our travel company, so I was blown away by the very stylish experience of the trip back to Cusco. The service felt truely first class, with silver service dishing up a 3-course meal and free wine/ champange and soft drinks. There were 2 bar carriages to the front, one with live Peruvian music, and other with a more quiet vibe. The seats are configured as a table of 4, next to a table of 2, seats are automatically booked to face each other - we were able to be moved to a table of 2 so we could enjoy a romantic dinner alone, the staff were very acommodating.The only shame was that we only got a small amount of sunlight before it got dark as we could have enjoyed the views!"

It is the most luxurious and gracious way to travel in Peru. The train is extremely comfortable, the carriage facilities first class and the service provided by all staff is attentive but unintrusive. Your luggage is taken care of from the minute you arrive at the station until you arrive at your hotel destination, and food and drinks are feely provided. Food is excellent - imaginative cuisine and well presented. Wine list is comprehensive . The observation car provides good views from which to take panoramic photos of the most beautiful countryside. Our outward bound journey was the best. The return journey was unfortunately spoiled by a few drunken younger folk who seem incapable of resisting free alcoholic drinks and whose raucous behaviour singing and dancing in the lounge and observation car was not inkeeping with the gracious image and services provided by the train. Staff looked on with disdain but no-one intervened !!! We felt the onboard musicians were unnecessary and perhaps their playing of western popular music , which was not inkeeping with the ambience, also contributed to the bad behaviour of the few. TIP- on the return journey ask to be seated in the carriage furthest away from the bar. Its an expensive way to travel but we thought it was worthwhile - a journey you do only once in your lifetime."

We got stuck next to two families with small children who proceeded to run up and down the aisle for about an hour until dinner was served. Then the crying began over the meal time and as desert was served the high pitch screaming began which was the last straw. We abandon our seats as did many in the car retreating to the club car for the remainder of the ride. The staff did nothing! In discussions with others we meant in the club car this was not an isolated incident they had a similar experienced on the train ride to Machu Picchu the day before.

At about 430$ each that's not a cheap ride...But overall, and for the unique experience, i may say it worth it.From Cuzco to Aguas Calientes, this luxury train makes time flying and with the Orient Express Team taking care of you, you almost forget the 3 and a half hour ride.To start with, at the rail station we got welcomed with Champagne, mimosas and a local dance troupe.The wagons have spacious and comfortable seating, where you will be served very well prepared dishes for lunchaccompanied by red and white peruvian wines.We spent some time on the last wagon, where there's a loung area, a bar and an observatory deck to take photos of the breathtaking scenery.They have a small band of musicians and singers that will entertain you with some of the classics from your respective countries.As we are italians, they sang for us O sole mio, And boy, to tell you how good these folks are....It was sung as good as an italian band would have... When you arrive at Aguas Calientes they have a Bus and a Guide waiting for youto go to the Machu Picchu site. Tickets to the site are included with you fare.A special credit to the local guide, German who had made the machu picchu tour even better.Once completed the archeological site visit, the Orient Express teamis waiting at the sanctuary lodge for a well deserved rest with a special buffet and refreshments.The bus will then pick us up back from the Sanctuary lodge down to Aguacalientes. So if you sum up the ride on the train to cuzco, a premium lunch, wine and champagne, the bus fares and tickets to machu picchu site, a premium tour guide for the site, another premium buffet, bus rides back to aguacalientes... and all of this in a high quality service end to end...It worth it... probably out of the pocket for youngs and backpackers, but if you can afford it, its a must."

The thinking here is that we would not feel like hiking up Machu Picchu with a belly full of Brunch so we opted for the dinner train. You do not see much at this time of evening so the focus is on the train and the dinner which was lovely. They offered champagne in the lounge before boarding and another cocktail when we took our seats - there was no lack of beverages and the service was superb. We headed into the Bar car before dinner only to find a dance party with band -what fun. It is an evening an train ride I will never forget. Worth the splurge, Book well in advance for desired dates. We are now looking at other historic train rides with the Orient Express."

            "review": "Worth it one way. This is a tough one to review because of the eye-popping premium charged for this train but I will try. In short, if your budget is such that you have to give up something else on your trip to do Hiram Bingham, then don't do it. However, if you are ok to spend the money, then I would recommend it at least one way. The ticket includes Machu Picchu entrance, tour guide during train ride and in ruins, round trip bus ride, lunch on the train, some wine and champagne, and all soft drinks. You also get a free tea hour at the Sanctuary Lodge at the ruins after the tour. If you are staying overnight, they also help coordinate with your hotel in Aguas Calientes for luggage hand off if you need it. In general, the service is great and definitely reduces the hassle factor for doing Machu Picchu, especially If you are trying to do it all in one day. The train itself is super cute and gives you that old world train trip charm. There is a bar car connected to an observation car but be warned that they perform live bar music in this area and it's a little over the top unless you're up for that. Personally, I found it annoying and wish they'd either played peaceful background music or nothing. However, the views from your private table in the dining car are just as good. I would recommend requesting a seat on the right side. The right side tables are all four person so if you are solo or a couple you might want to call to make your reservation to make it clear you want this. We were a couple and seated on the left. The view from those seats is fine, even preferable in some parts of the trip, but the train was not packed so we were able to switch to the right side anyways.The tour guide was great and our group was less than 10 inside the ruins. She spent two and a half hours with us and then lead us to the free tea hour at the Machu Picchu Sanctuary Lodge (only hotel at the ruins) which included soft drinks and finger food buffet.All things considered, I would say it was definitely worth the extra $100 (after factoring the value of all the extras) to ride HB over Vistadome. We rode Vistadome back. The plus of Vistadome is that instead of oxygenated AC you get skylights which enhance the view from your seat. However, this train is crowded, has no services except alla cart food and beverage, and there was an annoying cultural/fashion show that lasted 30 minutes and was not optional. You are also pretty much confined to your bus sized seat and shared table. I am not rich and I thought HB was worth it one way and if money was no object I would do it both ways if I had to do it all over again."

Do note that at this hour it is dark and you will see nothing of scenery - the focus is on their gourmet dinner which needs great improvement. I would imagine that there is more value for your money taking this Poroy to Aquas Calientes where you can enjoy brunch and the scenery.Good: pick up at Machu Picchu in a private bus / tea at the Sanctuary Lodge / cocktails in VIP lounge at the train station / wine on board / open bar on boardAverage: dinner on board uninspiring / slow speedOverall: I would not take it again given its cost of $300+ o/w.

The trains are clean and the seats fairly comfortable even though they do not recline at all. I will say that if you're overweight, you may be uncomfortable with the lack of space between you and the person traveling in the adjoining seat. It is a bench-type seat with no separator. I mention this because I have friends who struggle with weight issues, and I know that they'd have felt uncomfortable in that situation. Anyhow, the train has large windows and windows on the roof as well, so the views are nice as you take the 3 - 4 hour ride. Note, too, that there are forward-facing and backward-facing seats (essentially two people facing two people with a small table in-between) so if you're not fond of riding backward, then try to get a forward-facing seat when booking -- if possible."

The observation car provides wonderful views, which you cannot see on the return as it is dark. In addition, when taking the Hiram Bingham to Machu Picchu, you will be able to use one of their wonderful guides. A guide is a necessity at Machu Picchu to understand and better appreciate the space. And they provide a much needed bottle of water for the tour. The band we heard was top-notch. The food was delicious. We enjoyed the lunch better than the dinner on our return trip.The air on the return trip is festive and fun. The band moves from the Observation Car to the Bar Car. Music included sing-alongs and dancing (not an easy thing on a moving train). Too bad they don't sell CDs of the band; I would have purchased one. One way or round trip, you cannot go wrong with the Hiram Bingham Train."

On our train was a fashion show (that did have a 'you can purchase' component but it wasn't pushy at all) and a cultural performance.Do not pack heavy!

Food was really nothing special. Just tiny portions of everything you got. Contrary to other reviewers comments, all drinks are not free - \"premium\" brands as they put it are charged for. At the outrageous price for this train all drinks should be included. Yes, Agua Caliente is a mess with no directions on how to find the buses up to MP. We were staying at the Sanctuary lodge so were taken care of, but others would have been left wandering. Don't get me wrong, the HB is a great way to get to and from MP. MP is a once in a lifetime trip so we splurged on the HB and a stay at the Orient XP Sanctuary Lodge (about $1000 per night full board). Do it for this reason. Don't do it for value because the price does not reflect value received. NOTE: The toilet we used on the HB had the hot and cold faucets reversed. A trivial thing but NOT what you expect of Orient Express. It goes to attention to detail (or not).NOTE: at Poroy station the Peruvian dancers included a child of no more than 3 years of age. Perhaps this is legal in Peru, but in today's world Orient Express should evaluate whether they should be participating in child labor like this."

The service and food was great and was quite charming listening to the flackery clack as you made your way to cusco. One major event though showed truly what a great crew was on hand was when my son suddenly became short in breath and felt he was having a heart attack the crew jumped in and started oxygen and got a doctor on the phone to prepare him for arrival at the station where the same doctor and ambulance were awaiting. They were very concerned and all did everything possible for this emergency. I hope they read this and understand how thankful we are that they were so prepared and concerned. My son went to the hospital and was thoroughly checked out by the same doctor and was released with having experienced shortness of breath and a severe panic attack so happy ending.

The train crew wanted to put him over there, but they found a solution in a professional manner."

Our guide also gave us highlites of the sights during the train ride which was complete with a champagne breakfast. Our guide stayed with us and passed us right through the long lines to get into Machu Pichu and was thoroughly knowledgable about the sites. Lovely lunch at the hotel and great dinner on the train returning to Cusco. I was cold not having taken a jacket and was given a beautiful cashmere Orient Express blanket to wear!

When you step off the train, you are in a maze of vendor stalls with no indication of where you should go. We were completely lost and wandering in search of the bus to Macchu Picchu. After about 10 minutes of frantic searching in the rain we spotted a man carrying a Higram Bingham umbrella. He was apparently a staffer sent to round up lost passengers, of which there were many. Orient Express needs to improve this transfer preocess. Either guides for each small group of passengers or even a line painted on the pathway from the train to the bus with clear instructions would be useful in helping passengers find their way through the maze. After such a lovely experience on the train, being thrust into the total confusion of Aguas Calients was disappointing"

We traveled on the Hiram Bingham on the morning of our anniversary, May 30th, and were welcomed with a \"gleaming\" table setting just as advertised. Gorky, our waiter, provided outstanding service always with a smile. Our food and beverages were also great ~ I do not think you can miss with anything you might choose to order, both in flavor and presentation.We were equally impressed with Elisia who seemed to be everywhere ensuring all guests were enjoying the journey. She is professional, full of personality and is an asset to the Hiram Bingham train! We also returned the following night on the dinner train. The mix of travelers just seemed to mesh in the bar car prior to dinner and we all had such a wonderful time with the small band providing a super variety of music we all enjoyed. Some passengers got up and danced as the tables were pulled against the wall. We met several couples and have exchanged photos from the two journeys with one happy couple from our home state.Dinner on the return was again perfect, as well as the Pisco Sour drinks. We can not say enough about the Hiram Bingham and the spirited staff we encountered as both confirm it is \"About the journey\"! Our two journeys to celebrate our anniversary will not be forgotten!"

First time I went to Machupicchu in the mid 90's there was only one way to get there, in the local train where you had to sit for 4 hours in an extremely hard/rigid wooden seat & with chickens and guineas pigs ... since then lots had changed and now there are many alternatives at different prices but the one that really stands out is the Hiring Bingham Train that gets you to the ruins \"in Style\"The voyage is just Fantastic, the service, the food, the staff and entertainment on board is just something that you don't see quite often and a 5 star rating is not enough to describe how good it is. The attention to detail since the moment you show up to the moment you leave the train it's so personalize that you feel like royalty.The way back to Cuzco was so fun that you don't want it to be over, the band that plays live music was so good that they had the entire train dancing! while drinking tasty Pisco SoursWhen you do the math of everything you get for the ticket you pay then you realize that is 100% worth the rate!... the ride, the food, drinks, on board live entertainment, the bus to get up to Machupicchu, the guide tour for the ruins, lunch at the MP Sanctuary Lodge... etc I truly recommend this trip!"

You see alot of what is left of the terraces from the Incas. The plains change to a deep valley gorge with a rushing river. You pass through the ruins of the Inca Fortress. Yoou than enter the amazon type microclimate with wonderful view of beautiful flowers. Than you arrive in Aguas Calientes. it's about 2km from Machu Picchu. We spent a nite there, It was wonderful to explore the town. A must on anyones bucket list."

There is only one train a day from Hydroelectric to Aquas Calientas at 6:30 PM. To our surprise, it leaves exactly on time. some passengers reached the station 5 minutes earlier to departure and they were not allowed to board as there was not enough time and it is not safe to board a moving train. Very very impressive. The trian ride was smooth with average scenary views. The conductor was showing us few outstanding mountains and some Ruins throughout the trip. It was a great ride.The train from Aquas Calientas to Ollyantaytambo was also on time. They servered some snacks and Drinks during the ride.

HB was worth the splurge, especially on the way to Agua Calientes, because everyone was in a celebratory mood anticipating seeing Machu Picchu. It is a vintage train operated on a narrow gauge track train so expect lots of rocking back and forth at a slow speed. You also hear \"click click...click\" the entire time, too, because there are gaps in old style rails. I think it just added to the overall vintage ambiance.We enjoyed a first class experience from the time we arrived at the Poroy station to when we finished our tour of Machu Picchu. I'm glad we did the full Orient Express experience with the Hiram Bingham train coupled with a night at the Sanctuary Lodge because it was top class all the way. It started with champagne and mimosas while standing in line to check-in with the HB. Our bags were immediately handled and we didn't see them again until we reached the Sanctuary Lodge lobby. Service on the train was top class with drinks, lunch, music and a narrated tour included. Everyone on-board who was staying at the Sanctuary Lodge was assigned to the best tour guide we had during our South America vacation, Veronica. She escorted us from the train right to bus in Agua Calientes up to MP where we checked into the Sanctuary Lodge. Then Veronica gave us entrance passes into MP and an excellent walking tour for 3 hours. At the end of the tour, it was about 4:15pm and we had the option of either staying at MP to watch the sunset or follow her back to the Sanctuary Lodge for tea which was included in the HB price. We opted for the sunset and basically had the place to ourselves. It was a terrific time to capture photos of the citadel without hordes of peoples. "

It retrospect I have to say that this was a pretty incredible ride to Machu Picchu although I found it hard to enjoy it fully since the train moves very slowly (maybe 20 mph) and there is a constant side-to-side swaying motion throughout the entire 3 hour ride. (This was not the smooth, high speed ride I had anticipated). In fact, you may want to consider bringing along motion sickness pills even if you typically don't get sick. I'm an avid fisherman and spend lots of time on the ocean and I'm not typically prone to such problems but, after riding for that long in a seat that faced the rear of the train I was feeling a bit \"ugh\" by the time we arrived. Several members of our group actually did get sick by the end of the ride but I suspect the addition of alcohol consumption to train's motion may be what caused their problems.The train itself presents an incredible taste of luxury. Beautifully polished wood and brass fixtures, comfortable seating, good food and a very attentive staff made for an unforgettable experience."

Once on the train from Ollantaytambo to Machu Picchu, it is a wonderful ride: the scenery is fantastic and the train, which is spotlessly clean, in fact gleaming, trundles at an appropriately leisurely pace. I took the Expedition service going and the Vistadome returning. I do not recommend paying more for the Visatadome as the coaches are really the same with the glass-cornered ceilings. The hard sell of expensive clothing in the V'dome by the charming and friendly crew turned into a full-on Fiesta with dancing and music-- enjoyable for many but noisy and bothersome for me during my post-MPicchu reveries.What really, really annoyed me was paying for a service which I didn't receive: the very uncomfortable minibus rides to and from Cusco and Ollantaytambo which actually take up a longer portion of the journey. I knew this beforehand, but experiencing it was disappointing. P Rail should not be charging the full rates for this service when having to take these buses.Also, why are tourists forced to pay these very high rates? Once in Machu Picchu town (also known as Aguas Calientes) I went to the P Rail station further down the tracks (for locals!) and saw that prices are only s/10 (neuvo soles). Would I have been prevented from buying one of these tickets?Again, the train ride is great, although I don't like to be forced into an expensive tourist bubble. Go when the full service (currently scheduled from end of April) is operational."

The train as of April 2012 is only running from Ollantaytambo to Machu Picchu (1.5 hrs) so they provide a bus service from Cusco to Ollan (1.5 hrs). They have a nice office in the Plaza de Armas Cusco where you can book tix and print tix. The train was comfy enough, although the seating if you do it online is ridiculous. My husband and I were in opposite facing window seats across the aisle from each other! Maybe if you book in the office you can pick your seats, but the cheaper fares go quick. You get a complimentary soda/tea/coffee and snack (chips or nuts). The train goes pretty slow and has big windows to take in views of the Urubamba river and mountain scenery."

First class service and food, just like the old days of the Orient Express (or so it seems from the movies). A slow trundle along the Sacred Valley to Aguas Caliente at the base of Machu Picchu, with a very nice open viewing carriage at the back of the train. excellent food, and very well organised service including luggage handling. Seeing Machu Picchu would be worth any amount of inconvenience, but going on this train only enhances the experience. Well worth the cost. We stayed over at Machu Picchu, so didn't do the day return, but this looked like a pretty good option, although a long day. Decent espresso."

I am travel hardened. But really, PeruRail, which I fear represents Peruvian elite attitudes to foreigners, has achieved a new low.I have spent hours over days trying to book a ticket from Machu Picchu to Cusco, after finally managing to book a oneway ticket from Ollanta to MP. In case anyone can benefit from my efforts, I learned that I needed to use only Internet Explorer and that oneway tickets were much easier to book than roundtrip tickets. I already had a Verified by Visa account, so that was not a problem. Anyway, a couple of days after I booked Ollanta->MP, I tried to book an MP->Cusco ticket, but my card kept being denied. The same card that worked before. My bank told me that it did not receive any request for payment (which the PeruRail website told me). Verified by Visa (not exactly the best-run company) finally confirmed that VbV was not down. So, it's PeruRail. If you have a complaint, you can write in, assuming you can read Spanish, of course. No one will reply, though. These guys don't even publish their Skype number (assuming they have one) so you can call for free. And who might want to call in? Foreigners who now need to book in advance--the ones who would really benefit from a low- or no-cost way of getting through because of the terrible web site.PeruRail is established and elite-run, and it has rapidly and obscenely increased its prices over the past few years to gouge foreigners. Since PeruRail has a monopoly for the Cusco<->MP route and colludes with \"competition\" on the Ollanta<->MP route, and because the Peruvian government is in cahoots to make sure that no alternative mode of transportation for Ollanta<->MP will be created, one gets awful service at highway robbery prices. The alternative is to skip MP entirely.By the way, I am completely unsympathetic to Peru apologists who want to minimize this scandalous state of affairs. I am not expecting perfect service from those who are poor and are to be paid peanuts; rather, I am expecting satisfactory service from rich Peruvian elites who gouge foreigners. And you can bet that these elites care less than many foreigners do about poor Peruvians."

On board, that meant a guitar player and singer in the bar car, which made it very festive. Food was excellent and sophisticated. But the main thing is the terrain you pass through (very slowly--it's a 3 hour experience, when the Vistadome does it in half the time), which is the deepening valleys leading to Macchu Pichu."

And while there are a number of ways to get to these remote ruins, few equal a train ride on the Hiram Bingham from the Sacred Valley to Machu Picchu. The train runs every morning up to Machu Picchu and returns back that evening. This allows you to visit Machu Picchu in one day. My husband and I stayed at the Sanctuary Lodge for extra nights in order to give ourselves more time to hike around the site but you can cover a lot of it in the one day trip. Named after the academic and explorer from the United States who rediscovered Machu Picchu in the early 20th century, the Hiram Bingham train embodies the style, sophistication and luxury one would expect from an Orient Express train. The train itself is immaculate. Details of polished wood, \"period\" fixtures and fine fabrics make the interior beautiful and comfortable. The train carries up to 84 passengers and has two dining cars, an observation bar car and a kitchen car. The four hour ride from the embarcation point in the Sacred Valley along the Rio Sagrado is full of amazing views and delicious food. On the way up we were served a 4 course brunch and were treated to live music. After we arrived at the train station at the base of the mountain, we were assigned guides and taken by bus to the entrance to the national park. Since we were staying at the Sanctuary Lodge (an Orient Express hotel located at the entrance to Machu Picchu), we were given time to check in before our tour began. The guide was very knowledgeable and friendly. We did not know that this guided tour of the site was included in the cost fo the train but it was great to be able get a sense of the park before we explored on our own. After the tour, afternoon tea was provided at the Sanctuary Lodge. After tea, those who were not staying up at the site overnight were taken back down to the train station. My husband and I spent the next two days exploring Machu Picchu. (Note: While we absolutely loved the site and were really blown away by its beauty, a single extra day would have been enough extra time.) After two days, we reunited with the train group and took the evening train back to the Sacred Valley. The ride back was also very nice and we were served a delicious dinner as we rode down the valley. My husband and I had a remarkable time and words can't express the beauty of the site but we would do a few things differently if we were to do it again. First we were staying at the Hotel Monasterio in Cusco the nights before and after our trip to Machu Picchu. During the rainy season the train can't leave from Cusco and so there was an hour long van ride the morning we left and late the night we returned. Hotel Monasterio is a must-see in Peru but for the nights before and after the Hiram Bingham trip we would stay at the Hotel Rio Sagrado, an other Orient Express hotel in the Sacred Valley, where the train leaves from in the rainy season. This small change could have made our travel days a little easier. Secondly, as I mentioned before, we felt that two days at the Sanctuary Lodge was too much extra time at the site. We could have spent one day and been very satisfied with our time in the park. We would have loved to spend those extra days in Cusco staying at the Hotel Monasterio and exploring the many sites in the city. What is undeniable is that all of Orient Express' properties in this region of Peru are extraordinary, unique, AND well integrated. Even though we might change some small details about the trip, we wouldn't miss the experience of the Hiram Bingham or any other Orient Express proporties and neither should you!"

Climbing around Manchu Picchu will take a lot of energy, so be ready and rested when you get there. The train arrives around noon, when a lot of visitors are coming off the mountain, so the crush of visitors will be less in the afternoon than in the morning. Then, after you tramped up and down the ruins, at the end of the day, relax on your way back to your starting point (several options...we got on and off at Urubamba). Well worth the investment. The train pokes along at a very moderate pace, so its easy to take lots of photos."

They have a set menu both ways but have a full kitchen and will make whatever you ask if you have any dietary restrictions or just don't feel like what they have on the menu. The musicians are extremely talented and will play you anything you ask - and the ride back down turns into a party like some of the other reviewers mentioned.IMPORTANT - during the rainy season, part of the track is closed down and the train actually starts from Rio Sagrado - another Orient-Express property in the Sacred Valley - about 80-90 minutes away from Cuzco. The rest of the trip is completed by bus - not nearly as nice but a comfortable ride. On the way up we were actually already staying at a hotel in the Sacred Valley and since we weren't going from Cuzco we got a 25% discount, which I assume we would have gotten if we had stopped there on the way back as well. I don't know if you can specity this on the website so I would email the Hiram Bingham reservations person directly regarding the discount. Frankly I would have enjoyed coming back to the Sacred Valley vs Cuzco - the hotels there are very nice, the scenery beautiful, and it's not quite as high Cuzco for those sensitive to altitude. The taxi transfer is less than 25% of the cost the train so it will save you money as well."

After 2 days of the amazing experience that is Machu Picchu, it was wonderful to high tea at the Sanctuary Inn and then begin the Hiram Bingham experience. The red carpet and Peruvian band greeting us signaled that we were in for a special experience. The food and service all lived up to expectations for a high end transit experience. They did an excellent job of timing the meal in such a way that we had just finished up dessert when it was time to pull into the Cusco area."

The two combined make for unbelievable day, book the directly through the Hiram Bingham who will include the entrance fee, lunch, dinner and drinks. Forget staying over night at the Hermitage at Machu Picchu as, unless you are an archaeologist, a few hours with a guide is sufficient to take in all that is on offer. That apart there is nothing else to do there and you will have to wait 6pm the next evening to catch the same train back to Cusco.You are met at the Cusco station with a glass of champagne before you board to experience this first class service with five star waiters dressed to suit, wonderful seating, a carriage bar, an observation car with an open back end that could have come out of a John Wayne movie, but that is only the start The service, cuisine and drinks are of the the finest order and there is live music at the bar on the journey whilst a guide keeps you informed as you pass through various areas. On the way there band played mostly South. American music, but on the way home they decided to party. Chairs were pushed aside for dancing and the guide joined in on the tambourine. It was a riot with everything from Bill Halley to the Beatles with fantastic guitar playing and the drummer sitting on a box drum and the Picso Sours flowed until it was time for dinner. The train literally rocked home. Only Orient Express could make this such a life long memorable occasion."

I was so over-excited on getting on - was almost moved to tears! (I know!) We nearly missed the train from Ollantaytambo as our pick up arrived so late - but we got there just in time. The train is pure luxury. The service on board is absolutely first rate. The food is delicious - catering for veggies too with a really lovely meal. Coming back next day from Machu Picchu was just great. Make sure you go to the bar carriage for the live music for the first hour or so before dinner - great fun. The only thing that slightly spoiled it were some very \"gobby\" young Americans in the next but one booth who insisted on telling the world at large about their very important jobs and boring travel experiences. Why do americans complain about everything, speak so loudly and spoil things for everyone else? Anyway - lots of people were complaining about them and they were asked by another brave couple to turn it down a bit (very politely) but they responded by making very rude comments about them. Shame on them. But they did shut up (result!). Its not cheap to go on this train - but save up - combined with the lifetime ambition to go to Machu Picchu - this was truly amazing. Ill never forget it."

This review was solicited by the gratitude we felt toward the crew of the train who looked after us.You're no doubt reading this to work out if the HIram Bingham is really worth the extra $$ over any other train to Machu Picchu. The answer is \"Yes\".My wife and I would sit outside the normal demographic for this kind of tour with the majority of passengers being empty nesters. Still though, this didn't make us any less welcome from the time we set foot in the train station to when we returned some 12 hours later. Now, 12 hours is a long time to spend on a tour especially when 8 of those is spent getting to and from the destination. Elise, Henry and Humberto on our carriage made the journey a part of the experience (the landscape helped a little too!). Whether it's enjoying the excellent choice of food and beverage in your own dining booth finished in wood and polished brass fixtures, or standing at the back of the panormic view car taking in the scenery, the service team on the train are a delight and nothing is ever too hard.Our guide at Machu Picchu was Breytzi, and if the other guides are anything like her, rest assured you'll be well looked after. Breytzi took us through the citadel and talked us through the history and findings of this amazing place. She is lively and engaging throughout her presentation. Her tourists are her VIPs and she pays special care to make sure that;1. You get spectacular photos taken (Weather permitting)2. You don't battle your way through hordes of other groups.The 4 course dinner home is fit for any 5 star restaurant, after 3 weeks of touring South America, including the so called home of Beef, Argentina, we had the best piece of beef on a train in the middle of the Andes...Amazing.Entertainment is a trio of talented singers / musicians playing a mix of traditional music and hispanic classics that my wife and I couldn't understand but loved none the less. On our particular trip home the bar car was packed with what I can only guess were Latin americans or spaniards because the entire car was singing and dancing! Great fun. Of course if you prefer to relax, your dining car is far enough for this not to be a disturbance.My wife and I believe that exceptional service isn't hard, you just need to listen and to care. The attention to detail from the crew is exceptional. They look for opportunities to make you feel special, as this was our honeymoon the crew treated us to Champagne (a bottle, not a glass) on our return to Cusco, without being asked. Not once did we feel like we were expected to tip or pay for any additional services such as the dancers, or the musicians (which is rare in this part of the world), and the crew were always there to help you with information, water or something to eat.I hope this review helps you, for us this was a once in a lifetime trip and we were thrilled that the Hiram Bingham and it's crew delivered the experience in spades."

We didn't have much time, so after a bit of research we thought we would try the Hiram Bingham Train as part of a day trip from Cuzco.Although most trains leave very early in the morning, this one left around 9.00 a.m. It was a great three hour trip to the base of Machu Picchu. We started with a pre-boarding glass of orange juice or champagne, while watching traditional dancers and musicians. We were then entertained onboard with excellent peruvian music and provided with a delicious brunch just before our arrival. Brunch is a multi-course meal and not served until the last hour of the trip - so a light breakfast is advisable before boarding the train. Drinks, including tea, coffee, juices, soft drinks, alcoholic drinks and water, are complimentary throughout the trip.The views from the open observation car are spell binding. You pass through farming communities, small villages, and deep valleys. There is a constant stream of mountains and rivers, and you will see many locals tending to their animals, small plots of land, or walking along the roads.Once at Machu Picchu, an all inclusive tour of the famous site is done in small groups. One guide to six people. The tour starts with a bus ride up the steep and narrow dirt road to the top of the mountains. You then walk to the high part of the ruins and begin your afternoon tour. The benefit or arriving long after the early morning trains is that the crowds are much smaller. After the tour, there is some free time, and a very extensive afternoon tea, with complimentary drinks, savouries and sweets, for those that need replenishing. Its then back down the mountain to board the train for the trip back to Cuzco.The trip back was in darkness. This did not matter, because we were served a 5 course degustation meal, with drinks included, then treated to a party with music, dancing and fun for everyone who went to the bar and observation cars. You can stay in the quite surounds of the main cabin if you prefer a quieter or more private trip back. We arrived back in Cuzco around 9.30 p.m. after a fantastic day out.The service and staff are excellent, and the cost is very reasonable for what is offered - particularly if you compare the price with other Orient Express trains in Europe and Asia.This trip is suitable for people of all ages, but may not be ideal for younger children who want space to run around and play. Unless you intend to overnight at Machu Picchu, I would highly recommend this option as a way of visiting one of the world's best treasures in style!"

We felt the romantic experience of travelling on an luxury vintage train 'comme il faut'. It a real Orient-Express feeling. On the way to Machu Picchu, in the morning, we were enjoying the view and listening to variable songs (since Peruvian to songs from the countries of the customers) on the back of the train. We were surprised about them serving pasta on the lunch, but when we arrived at Machu Picchu we understood why: we went right away to the monument, walking a lot up and down and we needed that energy. However, the guide walked very fast (it was tuff to follow) and was extremely 'politically correct'. I enjoyed more listening to the explanations of the other local guides about the historic fates and the Spanish invasion. On the way back, at night, we had a first class diner. It worths every cent!!!"

The pullman cars are beautifully restored with wood paneling and brass fixtures. The club car at the end of the train also has an outdoor observation deck worth enjoying along the journey. Champagne, mimosas, and well drinks are included along with an incredible Brunch to Machu Picchu with dinner on the return trip. A trio of 2 guitar players and 1 drummer keep everyone entertained for the 3.5 hour journey. The Left side of the train is the preferred side for the best views of the Urumbamba Valley.The staff is professional, helpful and polite. The Hiram Bingham train is a very relaxing experience.

Take the train from the Poroy Railway Station to get the \"whole nine yards\" - indigenous dancers and a Mimosa to send you on your way. The countryside is beautiful and the brunch (going) and dinner (returning) make for a special eventMy only disappointment? We specifically scheduled our evening trip back to Cusco the night of our 37th wedding anniversary. Unfortunately, there was no acknowledgement of the occasion by any of the staff on the train. As a matter of fact, they first seated us across from a boisterous family of 5 and when we asked to change, we were told there was nothing available....even when I said it was our anniversary. We finally ended up joining an Italian couple we had met the day before.I have friends who took the Hiram Bingham train up and back from Machu Picchu in one day. I would not recommend that. Slow down your pace, stay over at least one night and spend more time enjoying Machu Picchu. How many times in your life do you get to experience something so incredible?"

Not until we arrived in Cusco did we find out that the train left from Olyentambo, about 1.5 hours by bus on bumpy roads. The line from Poroy to Olyentambo having been closed since December! The thing is, we had purposely moved from Olyentambo to Cusco the night before to catch the train.So we still paid full price for half a journey. I know the fine print saysthey can alter the journey, but why not be up front when we booked and tell us it was closed - everyone else knew it wouldn't open until late May - except us.The 1.5 hour bumpy bus trip aside, the train, staff and meal were fine, but $322 per person for 2.5 hours..........A mistake by our travel agent meant we had to return by Vista Dome. About 1/5 the price, quicker and you get better views through the roof.Glad we went, but disappointed for the above reasons. before to catch the train only to have to drive all the way back.Our complaint is - why do they"

They fed us and kept the alcoholic drinks coming at all times. If I were coming to Machu Piccu again, this is the only way that I would travel."

Being in this remote area, and concerned about the quality of touristic facilities here, we decided to be on the safe side and chose the Hotel Monasterio in Cusco ( by Orient Express also) and the Hiram Bingham. Our trip to Peru turned out to be a truly memorable experience. The train transported us back 100 years to the tales of the London-Venice journeys. It was the right amount of luxury for the place. Not too fancy yet enchanting in every way. We wore jeans and hiking boots, appropriate for this destination. We were pampered by highly trained staff and enjoyed blissfully as the ride took us through a breathtaking scenery. Everyone involved was courteous and their attention to every detail was striking. There is brunch on the way out and dinner on the way back. Food was incredible, and the maitre d'hotel was able to accomodate to changes in the menu and the waiters were simply the finest. There are musicians on board and they were also amazing ! They also provided the tour guide for Machu Picchu and he was wonderful. Tea is also included after the Machu Picchu visit at the Sanctuary Lodge and that was also welcomed after experiencing a day of hiking. They took care of our bags to/from the hotel and everything went smoothly. No point in revealing all the details as it is best to discover it yourself....."

The service was impeccable, the food was delicious, the atmosphere was perfect, and the destination itself exceeded our expectations. We are both vegetarians, and our requirements were catered for (albeit, we had to remind them at the time of serving, even though this information was confirmed via email, as well as when we boarded). It was fantastic walking around the citadel with a guide all to ourselves, and due to the time of day, it was significantly less crowded than it would\u2019ve been earlier in the morning (which is when most of the tourists arrive). The return journey was delightful. We had struck up conversations with another couple on the outward journey, and were able to continue our chats over our superb 4-course meal (with lovely accompanying wine) on the way home. Nothing about our experience aboard the Hiram Bingham train could be faulted. It was a magical experience."

The service provided by HB itself was inconsistent and the food on outbound trip mediocre:1. I was not offered champaign while boarding in Cusco but instead was hurried to my seat without any offer to take my luggage.  I had to take the initiaitve to go back out and pick up my own champaign and later hand my luggage to one of employees who happened to by..2. On return trip, I was told by the gate agent (I did not get his name but later told Marie at HB about the gate agent) that it was not time to board when I attempted to check in. He proceeded to check in other customers.  After realizing that departure time was even closer, I went back to gate agent to show my ticket again. He then waived me into train area. I wonder if the four travellers who I witnessed did not make their  earlier train also experience this extremely poor and down right rude  service by the agent.3. Be forewarned travlers that the seat number on your ticket does not  guarantee you that particular seat. I was assigned with families both trips not corresponding with my seat number. I understand constraints  that solo travelers might face. However, to not to have seat assignments respected nonchantly ignored was quite intolerable.In short, I am stil numb from the poor to downright abysmal service I received on the Hiram Bignham Train on Tuesday, 28 December 2010. I plan to escalate this issue with management."

My wife and I took the HB to Machu Picchu from Olianta and the returned on the next day after staying at the Lodge to Cusco.... at 11 PM in mid December. My succinct advice is to select any of the other trains and train companies now available. 1. The cost is $255 per person per trip / regardless if you board on Poroy or Olianta. A marketing ploy which annoys me and, perhaps more important, would dissuade one from visiting Olianta and its environs which has some of the best attractions in Peru.2. The later outgoing time is nice but the return trip of over four hours was mostly, in December, in the dark with an arrival time at your hotel in Cusco after 11PM. Ugh! My suggestion is to take an earlier train, enjoy the customary tour, stay overnight at the Lodge, and return on an afternoon train that gets you in Cusco at some reasonable time and allows you to see some of the countryside.3. All the O/E ads and their palaver are quite overdone. Yes, the service is elegant and personal, however I found it no more exceptional than the delightful service I received from EVERYONE in Peru .... from baggage handlers, to bartenders, to waiters, to receptionists, drivers, guides and, even from, the room maids.4. On both trips, a rowdy group of vacationers were permitted to yell and whoop with the combo which was playing Spanish songs more appropriate in a Cantina than en route to the Sacred Sanctuary. When I suggested that some Peruvian music might be more suitable to set the mood and to allow conversation with companions and possible introductions to new friends, nothing ...NOTHING ... was done! Going, we skipped dessert so that we could go the the vacant club car and enjoy the ambience of the train that we had expected. Nice! On the return, another group commandeered the club car with similar loud music and yelling for one and one-half hours until everyone was called to dinner.5. Our friends had opted to stay on at the Arwana and came to MP on the following day on a vista dome coach ,.... totally enjoying their train trip and given a unique DVD about the Inca Trail as a souvenir! I wish I had joined them at considerably less expense and more pleasure but we were taken in by our images of Agatha Christie and the Original Oriental Express. Alas!So again, it is strange that O/E who operates both the HB and the Lodge can have suchdifferent reactions from vacationers. I would stay at the Lodge again with hesitation but would seek out another train to Machu Picchu. I do not believe that after spending over $1000 for a 40 km train ride, my pleasure and enjoyment should depend upon whether I was lucky enough to have reasonable fellow passenger or be subject the noise pollution that made both trips virtually unbearable unless I wanted to sneak away to some corner of the train for respite."

We did enjoy the live music and the bar car, with great views of the surrounding countryside. The guides were knowledgeable, expecially our Machu Picchu guide, Jaime. Unfortunately, we didn't enjoy the food on the train very much. It's that fancy French-style food that seems over-processed to our tastes - 2 tiny slices of steak, a small triangle of omelette with bits of asparagus, and some little bitty crepes. We are not picky eaters, but we prefer simple, whole, local foods. Hey, we're in the Andes, so why not serve dishes made with potatoes, corn, quinoa, chiles, etc? I think the Hiram Bingham train would be worth the expense if the food was better. However, as it was, I'd have to say we were disappointed. I recommend taking the mid-priced train to Machu Picchu, instead of the Hiram Bingham."

We booked a return trip on the same day opting not to stay the night in Machu Picchu or the viscinity.The tickets includes the entry and guide to Machu Picchu, bus transfer from Aguas caliente to the Machu Picchu site, all inclusive beverages on the train (incl peruvian alcoholic beverages and they do have espresso machine for those interested), Brunch on the train to Machu Picchu, Diner on the train back from Machu Picchu, light meal and tea/coffee at the sanctuary lodge at the Machu Picchu site.Our journey started our great as we were greated at the train station with choices of Mimosa, Sparkling Wine or Juice and a traditional dance show. That was a great way to kick things off.On the train there were two wagon for us to go from, the Diner car and the Bar/Observation car. The first part of the 4 hours trip was spent in the bar/observation car where musicians provided ample entertainment and drinks flowed freely. The later part of the trip was spent having brunch in the diner car. The brunch consisted of 4 courses which were all great.Once we arrived to Aguas caliente we were ushered to buses that took us up the road to machu picchu. We were assigned a guide and given tickets. Keep in mind you only get about 2h on the machu picchu site with this visit so make sure the guide will show you what you want. Since there were older people in our group and the ride can be quite steep, our guide only did the lower areas. We opted to abandon our guide and go the way up.We met our group back for the afternoon tea which includes a very nice buffet in the sanctuary lodge restaurant. It was good to eat as we were hungry from our machu picchu visit.On the train back, the same pattern apply where we spent about 2 hours before dinner in the bar car with the musician and then the later 2 hours having dinner. Overall we were extremely pleased with our experience in the Hiram Bingham train. It's probably not something you do more than once but it was well worth it to us. My wife was at first skeptical but she was completely charmed by the experience and will be recommending it to her friend/family."

It was really nice to have someone available to guide you through the train station, the lines, etc. The food at the Sanctuary Lodge (part of your ticket price) was quite good and was actually the best ceviche I've had so far in Peru.

We originally tried to book one of the less expensive trains, only to find out they were all booked for the date we had planned to go. So we sucked it up and booked the Hiram Bingham. We were not disappointed.The train was small--it consisted of two dining cars, a bar car, and a kitchen car. Prior to departure we were treated to traditional dances/music at the train station, along with champagne. The trip to Machu Picchu was very leisurely, and the observation platform at the end of the bar car was the perfect place to watch the changing landscape. We enjoyed brunch, followed by entertainment (two musicians) for the duration of the trip. The musicians were great, and enouraged audience participation on instruments such as the hooves and animal jaw. (The entire trip was open bar, so as you might imagine there were some folks who really let loose.) Once we arrived at Aguas Calientes, we were taken by bus to Machu Picchu. The ride to Machu PIcchu--up an incredibly steep, windy, and narrow road--was an adventure in and of itself. Our English-speaking guide was simply terrific. Incredibly knowledgable, he took us through the ruins at a good pace, and gave us plenty of time to snap photos. After the tour, my boyfriend and I opted to explore the ruins on our own rather than attend the tea at the Sanctuary Lodge. We probably had an hour to explore before we got back on the bus for the trip down the mountain and back to the train.On the train ride back we were served a delicious 4 course dinner and treated to more musical entertainment--a bit more subdued than on the train ride out, though.Was it worth it to pay such an exhorbitant amount of money for this day trip? Absolutely. It's really a once in a lifetime experience--and we found it was worth every penny."

Fragile environment. Amazing energy place. The train trip back was a wild ride with the free flowing Picso sours and raucous sing along action in the back bar car.

We had a wonderful time, made all the better by the ever helpful Jesus (waiter) and Carlos (tour guide). The part that was most helpful was the arrival time into Machu Picchu and the fact that when you arrive, the majority of people have left and the place feels empty! That in itself was justification for the cost of this trip, for us at least. On average they say that about 3,000 people visit the site per day and by the time the HB arrives only a few hundred are left. That may seem like a large number but with the space of the site, it really felt like we were a privileged few.There are a couple of things that I would like to point out, not complaints, more like 'quibbles'. The first point is the lady representative at The Monasterio hotel (see separate review) she did not exactly give you a warm reception and was downright cool. I am certain that the OE train division wishes for their staff to appear professional and approachable at all times - well she was not. It felt like we were imposing upon her when we were clarifying details for the trip in advance.The second point is that I do not eat meat and we had told the staff at The Monasterio (Peru rail division) in advance. The lady (above) said 'do not worry there will be plenty of choice on-board and a choice of fish'. This was good enough for me as I'm easily pleased and knew that a good chef would be able to muster something up. Once we boarded Jesus (waiter) advised me to talk to Warren (Maitre D') about dietary requirements. I did so and he said that he would be able to come up with vegetables for me to replace the meat dishes. I said that would be fine for the morning train ride but for dinner I'd like a fish option. He said he thought that would be fine. Ordinarily I'd be happy with just veggies but the trip isn't cheap (as I'm certain you are aware) and I wanted 'proper' food, but I wasn't antsy about it. Another waiter brought the brunch out and on it was the meat dish, of course it was sent back (disappointing that an error was made from a 5* service provider and so few people on the train). Then after the first course Warren asked me if I had enjoyed the alpaca?! There were less than 20 people on board (and only one non-meat eater on that day) so I know that he was just making a point!! He had a superior air about him on the journey up to MP, but relaxed more on the return journey and played the drums in the bar-cart with the musicians. (For dinner the chef did concoct a great fish dish, so if you don't eat meat don't worry there are options and food is great quality). The Pisco-sours are made in a blender and so lacked the genuine taste that I had savored elsewhere."

I tried to count how many courses we got in our meal, but lost track. From the appetisers and the Pisco Sours, to the final chocoloates an hour and a half or so later, everything was superbly presented, nicely sized portions (not overeating despite the umber of courses), and very high quality food.How many trains have you been on, where you can not only order your steak medium rare, but also have the waiter tell you \"Your seafood allergy is absolutely no problem sir - I'll simply ask the chef to prepare that particular course for you without crab. It will be cooked entirely separately\" ?Yes, it costs a few bucks - but I encourage you to do it at least once in your life.BTW, for guests staying at the Machu Picchu Sanctuary Lodge - there is a special \"Hiram Bingham Bus\" that will take you to the train station from the lodge, at something like 4:45pm. You can even do what we did and just leave your luggage at the lodge while you wander around and find your own way into town - the lodge's concierge can arrange for your left-luggage to take the \"Hiram Bingham bus\" into town without you - the luggage will be waiting in a safe location on the platform right next to the train as you board."

The train does not offer only luxury and confort but the whole package that allows you to enjoy nthe visit without any concerns regarding: hire a guide (don\u00b4t even considerer to visit the sanctuary without a guide - you will not understand the dimention and history of the place and may be expose to risk o danificate any part of the memorial).They provide you a full service, including meals, transportation, tickets at entrance (about 40 usd), bus to go and return to the sanctuary (another 15 usd) plus guides in english or spanish.I very glad to use the hiram bingham service in my recent visit to Machu Pichu, I was short on time (only day) and without it I probably will not enjoy as much as I did.The train is the only one with a observation deck at the car tender that allows you to take pictures and film during the journey. The vistadome does not provide the same visibility. The trip itself to Machu Pichu is very interesting crusing the \"Vale Sagrado\" and several canions.Also they arrange package in their hotels (top class and top price). If you need any cheaper hotel, there are plenty of them in aguas calientes. The train could be booked to go in one day and return on a different date."

            "review": "One of the best days of my life!. I just returned from a round-trip journey on the Hiram Bingham and found it perfect in every way. The ride itself & journey to Machu Picchu was everything I had hoped it would be, and more. I notice some people complain about the cost, but when I compare this trip to other luxury adventures, I feel it was a very good value. Personally, I felt it was worth the splurge for a once-in-a-lifetime trip to such a destination.The train was outfitted with the highest quality decoration and was very comfortable. The dining car included fine linens and meals served on china. Brunch & dinner were extensive, and superbly presented. There was a choice of entree for dinner, and the staff went out of its way to accommodate dietary restrictions, asking each passenger if they had any concerns. I had just one, and they were able to suggest a fine alternative for me.The bar & observation car was a real treat. The later was best on the outbound trip, where the very end was open-air and you could take excellent photos of the changing scenery. The bar car was best on the return; I was surprised more people did not take advantage of this car. Live musicians entertained during the entire journey, and much of the staff joined in as well. After a few drinks, the passengers joined in too :) I cannot say enough about the staff on the train and probably should have mentioned them right up front. In just a few short hours I felt like I had known them from days and was on a first name basis with each of them. They truly went out of their way to be welcoming and treat each guest to a first class experience. On the return trip they even surprised me at desert by singing \"Happy Birthday\" in English and then Spanish. I should mention that the bilingual staff speaks perfect English, you will not encounter any language barrier whatsoever.Not enough can be said about Machu Picchu itself, the highlight of the trip. Our guide had 10 years of experience and was very knowledgeable. There were only 5 people in our group for the tour, but I believe normally this is larger.When I booked the trip I was concerned about the demographics of the other passengers, thinking I may be out of place on such a journey. I was pleasantly surprised that there was a very wide range of ages, backgrounds, lifestyles and cultures represented by my fellow passengers. I met many friendly fellow travelers.In summary, I strongly recommend the Hiram Bingham if you are interested in the trip of a lifetime. I know no one on my trip had any complaints."

            "review": "The wonderful way to enjoy a wonder of the world!. I am proud to be a Peruvian, who lives in Miami for 10 years now. As most of my friends, we went to Machu Picchu when we were finishing the high school and never went back. I am too embarrassed to recognize that I did not come back in 17 years. However, ending the difficult 2008, I decided to spend new year\u2019s in Cusco with my mom and my sister. We had only three days, so dedicating a full day to Machu Picchu was our idea. We decided to go on the Hiram Bingham train on December 31st, 2008, and I consider that it was the best idea that we had in the whole year. The train was spectacular!!! What a marvelous way to finish a year!!The crew welcomed us in the station with champagne and mimosas, and a group of folkloric dancers cheered the morning up. Then, when we were on board, the personnel served some pastries and coffees in the bar-car where a coca-leaves-reader was waiting for us. We spent part of the ride in the bar and observation car, not only because the view along the route was splendid, but also because there was entertainment in that car. My mom, my sister and I were delighted by singing and becoming part of the duo who provided the entertainment, playing maracas and/or bongos. The staff of the bar was very attentive filling our glasses up during all the ride. I drank a delicious sparkling wine and my mom drank Pisco sours, all included!!! After an hour or so, a very pleasant attendant showed us that the brunch was served in our places in the dining car. The food, which was prepared with Andean local ingredients, was, even though it was a three-course, light and delicious in order to be lightly enough to go up in Machu Picchu. Smart thinking!!!!In Machu Picchu, we had our guided tour (also included!!!). There were just 8 of us being led by German, who knows lots of history and made our experience at the ruins so meaningful!!! After three and a half hours in Machu Picchu, we went to the Sanctuary Lodge for the tea time. The delicacies which were served with the tea were exquisite!Back on the train, we found a train beautiful decorated with party favors to celebrate new year\u2019s on board. In our table, we had hats, whistles and streamers which were bringing forward what we will have in our way back. Despite the fact that it was dark and we cannot enjoy the view in the way back, the ride was even more spectacular!!! They served us a five-course dinner which was delicious to say the least! And after the luxurious dinner, they celebrated with us the new year\u2019s in the bar-car singing, dancing and cheering all the way back. They also simulated the new year\u2019s eve countdown and I felt that after that splendorous journey, 2009 would be as amazing as our Hiram Bingham ride. I really want to mention every single person in the crew who made our ride a perfection, but I hardly remember the names. I remember Elisa and Eliana. Thank you very much for giving us a royalty treatment!!!!The train is special and elegant and this ride in one day is the wonderful way to get to a wonder of the world. For me the Hiram Bingham experience was as stunning as the ruins. The decoration, ambience, food and specially the service were incredible!!! I highly recommend everybody to go to Machu Picchu on the Hiram Bingham train. Being a Peruvian who live outside of my country, tears of pride is the least that I have when I see the wonders of my country and when I see how those wonders are excelled by the impeccable service of the people of the Hiram Bingham train. I loved every minute of the way. We had a blast!!!!!"

            "review": "Yes it's overpriced. But it was awesome. For me, worth it!. I debated whether it was worth the extra dough. I was doing Machu Picchu in 1 day and returning to Cuzco the same day. I like to travel fast but I also like my sleep, especially at high altitude. Much of the reason I chose HB train was because of the departure time. It leaves at 9a.m. vs. the other trains around 6 or 7. Too early for me. The other advantage of the later departure time is because the other trains get to MP so far ahead of HB, MP isn't as crowded when you tour it. I have pics of the main part with no tourists at all mucking up my pics. Lastly, the ticket price includes a professional guided tour of MP and the entrance fee, which is a bit pricy.  After further research I determined I would take the HB to MP but I took the Backpacker Train back to Cuzco. Why? 1) I had an early flight out of Cuzco the next morning so I wanted to get back ASAP. The backpacker gets to the Poroy station 1 hour earlier than HB. I figured 3 - 4 hours in MP was enough for me and I was correct. Some may wish to spend days wandering MP but I took 125 photos and had a guided tour and the time there was just right. 2) Part of the allure of the train ride is the amazing views of the mountain passes. Most of the return ride home is in the dark. So you are paying for a comfy seat and a nice dinner. I didn't think it was worth it. The Backpacker train was packed and I had little leg room. No food on the train so I grabbed a sandwich at the station before I left. But I was glad to get back 1 hour earlier at a 1/6th of the price.What I liked: The back of the train is like the Vistadome train with windows on the ceiling. I stayed there most of the ride getting awesome pics. Also, the service was top-notch. They remember your name and your likes and dislikes. Amazing for such a remote part of the world. Also, the food was VERY good. Departing from the Poroy station is smart. The other trains have to sidewind up a mountain above Cuzco before they hit the Poroy station. This takes about an hour. It's only a 20 minute taxi ride to Poroy so you can save time by leaving Poroy.What I didn't like: First, the train did rock quite a bit but I don't think it's their fault. It's the rails. Second, they fed us brunch at 11a.m. so you need to get breakfast at your hotel before you leave. Also, while I was eating I was missing the best photo ops of the entire trip. It would seem to me instead of brunch, they should do a breakfast earlier so photog's like me could get the best vistas. ***** THERE WERE ONLY 7 PASSENGERS ON THE ENTIRE TRAIN. This obviously increased the level of service but it seemed to match what others have written. I'm sure Perurail is losing an arm and a leg with this economy. The train was EMPTY. There was probably room for about 80 passengers. Lucky us."

Stayed one night at the Sanctuary Lodge right on the mountain and then the next day back on the Hiram Bingham. For the price you pay, i would not recommend the return journey so much. It is dark, so there is nothing to seeand all you get for your money is a 4 course dinner. My partner spent $50 US on drinks as not everything is complimentary and when we arrived back at Poroy station there was not a cab to be found and we were lucky some of the staff helped us out as within 5 mins of the train arriving, the place was completely deserted, all guests and even the train were gone. save yourself alot of money and come back down on the Vistadome train, still a good train and spend your extra money on something worth while."

The train itself was very nice and elegant and we were treated first class all the way- as well we should be. The meal and bar service was very nice but not mind blowing in any way at all. The return service was in complete darkness so the scenery was not a factor at all.I think taking the HB train was my biggest regret on this tour of Peru, i would have been much happier with the exponentially cheaper vistadome or even the backpackers train for that matter."

            "review": "Not quite the ticket. Having travelled on the Orient Express from London to Venice I was quite excited at the prospect of travelling on the Hiram Bingham train through the Sacred Valley in Peru. A transport strike had prevented our outward journey so we could only travel on the return. On arrival at the station everything seemed splendid with a duo playing musical instruments and the conductors all looking splendid in cloaked uniforms as they welcomed the passengers onboard and a happy busy atmosphere as we were escorted to our seats. That's where the similarity with the Orient Express ended. I know luggage space is restricted but most people looked as if they had just walked off the mountain and boarded the train, boots and all! A plentiful suppy of pisco sours were poured before dinner which was a simple 3-course meal offering two choices of main course (meat or fish). The bar was nice with rich wood panelling and a good stock of drinks (excellent gin and tonics) but the observation deck was small and not very inviting or comfortable. The bright lights in all the carriages and motion of the train resulted in very bleary photos (or maybe it was the piscos and gin) so I was disappointed not to have a better collection of photos of the evening. Maybe it was just my camera as most shots look like the arty shots you see of motorways when the headlights appear like strips of lighting. Anyway I have no worthy photos of the evening but a very happy memory of a lively, fun-filled night aided by extremely courteous and efficent staff"

For the first three days there we explored the city of Cuzco and its surrounding ruins. We had a great time and learned so much from this great culture. On the third day we woke up early to go to Poroi where the train was leaving at 9am. The employees treated us like royalty, we had some champagne and mimosas and after a few typical dances got on the train. This train is how trains should be everywhere, very spacious with a great bar that would serve us pisco sour as soon as the glass was empty. We went to the back of the train where there was some live music and enjoyed an indescribable view, almost magical with mountains and beautiful vegetation. I want to thank especially Eliana Taipe, and Carolina Saenz who made this trip extra especial with their great personalities and attention to detail.I strongly recommend this train to go to Machu picchu and if you encounter this ladies tell them that el primo says thank you for everything."

We hiked the Inca trail to Machu Picchu then splurged on one way Hiram Bingham tickets back to Poroy station (15mins outside Cusco). We departed via private bus from the Sanctuary Lodge at 4:45. The train was set to leave Aguas Calientes at 5:45. Once in AC, we could shop in the market for a bit or go directly to the train. The train is elegant inside and out. The staff was very well trained and professional. We noticed they did not pay much attention to the seat numbers on our tickets. We checked in and were escorted to our 2 person booth. The ride takes approximately 3 \u00bd hours. It gets dark around 6:15pm in the winter months so we were only able to see the views from the observation car for about 30 mins before it was dark. There are 2 dining cars and in August you can expect both to be full. It takes the entire 3 \u00bd hours to finish your meal and the staff have this down to a science. You will be finishing your dessert and coffee as you arrive in Poroy. Everything from the d\u00e9cor, food, drinks and service were excellent. The staff even presented us with a gift when we arrived in Poroy simply based on a question I had asked before we left AC. I was blown away. Customer satisfaction is obviously their top priority. The only thing that could make this an unpleasant trip would be those seated around you. We were stuck between two loud, obnoxious parties. Thankfully, everything else was wonderful."

The Hiram Bingham is an Orient Express train that runs from Poroy, just outside of Cusco, to Aguas Calientes, the town closet to the ruins of Machu Picchu, and back. The trip takes approximately 3 1/2 hours in each direction. Booking is handled through Peru Rail and can be a bit of a challenge. But once on board, the staff is marvelous (thanks Ellie), the food is great and the views are to die for, though the return trip, at least in winter, is mostly in the dark. If trekking the Inca Trail is not your bag and you require a little more pampering, then consider the Hiram Bingham."

On a recent trip to Cusco, Peru, however, I missed my bargain train to Machu Picchu and was forced to take the more expensive and luxurious Hiram Bingham Train by Orient Express with 5-Star service. What a happy accident. I was a little unsure of the experience when we began, but loved every minute of the way. The train cars are beautifully restored and classy. The service is second to none from the champagne/mimosas upon embarking to the gourmet meals on-board. The train manager Elisa and her great staff made sure that every passenger's need was attended to. The awe-inspiring scenery was enhanced by the songs of the duo who played classical guitars. The bar car featured a meticulously restored wood and brass bar with an outdoor fresh-air platform at the rear.Once we arrived at Aguas Calientes, we were broken into smaller groups and taken up to Machu Picchu. Each group had an excellent guide who spoke English. The guides made the stones of Machu Picchu come alive with the lore of the past. The return trip to Cusco was magical as the sun set over the majestic cliffs and farmland of Peru.I would recommend this trip to anyone who has a limited time to see Machu Picchu. This fit perfectly into my itinerary as I was able to see everything in one day and in high style and comfort. My only reservation was that i arrived too late to Machu Picchu to climb Juana Picchu, the tall jagged peak that overlooks Macchu Picchu.Overall, The Hiram Bingham Orient Express Train to Machu Picchu was wonderful and I would highly recommend the experience to all travelers."

From the night before, when they delivered overnight bags to our hotel in Cusco, to the very end, it was an amazing experience.

Once on the train we were seated together in one of the two dining cars and a very pleasant attendant showed us the bar and observation car. The views along the route were spectacular. There was entertainment in the observation car which we became part of, playing maracas, tamborine, jaw of an [-] and a cow bell. Lunch with wine was excellent and the service was impeccable. The bus ride to Machu Picchu was stunning and MP itself cannot be described, it must be seen. We stayed overnight at the Inkaterra Lodge which is a destination in itself. The rooms and grounds are incredible. Dinner there was a bit disappointing but the service was good. Most of us spent the next day on the hotel grounds doing the various tours available - spectacled bear, orchids, etc. The return trip was wonderful, mostly spent in the dining car reliving the experience and eating another wonderful meal. All drinks were included in this trip back. One of the many wonderful services we received on the train was luggage handling. After the bags were stowed on the train, we never touched them except to pack and unpack. They were delivered to and from the hotel for us.

My only issue was with the arrival in Aguas Calientes. When you step off the train, you are in a maze of vendor stalls with no indication of where you should go. We were completely lost and wandering in search of the bus to Macchu Picchu. After about 10 minutes of frantic searching in the rain we spotted a man carrying a Higram Bingham umbrella. He was apparently a staffer sent to round up lost passengers, of which there were many. Orient Express needs to improve this transfer preocess. Either guides for each small group of passengers or even a line painted on the pathway from the train to the bus with clear instructions would be useful in helping passengers find their way through the maze. After such a lovely experience on the train, being thrust into the total confusion of Aguas Calients was disappointing."

Upon arrival, we were greeted by a colourful display of traditional dancers and musicians. Elegant Orient Express employees in capes were serving champagne, orange juice and mimosas. Our \"Hiram Bingham\" embroidered overnight bags (we were staying at the Sanctuary Lodge that night) were taken from us and we were checked in and informed of our seating assignment for brunch.The train is every bit as special and elegant as we had hoped it would be. Not having travelled on an Orient Express train before, it fulfilled all of our expectations with respect to decor, ambience, food and service. Even the washrooms were luxurious: wood, marble and fresh flowers!We enjoyed more mimosas with some croissants in the bar car as we chugged out of the station. Those were followed by cappuccino with tiny sugar cookies to hold us over until brunch. As we coasted through some of the most beautiful scenery we've ever experienced, the passengers mingled and enjoyed the live music being played in the observation car.Brunch was three courses, and each was terrific. The presentation was lovely as well. We enjoyed our easy conversation with a charming couple from the UK.In no time we arrived at Aguas Calientes, where we disembarked and were transported by bus up to Machu Picchu. An added perk was our guided tour - there were just 8 of us being led by the very charismatic Nino. He made our experience at the ruins so much more meaningful than if we had just wandered around on our own with our guidebook.Unfortunately we had booked a Perurail \"Ferrostal\" train to take us from Aguas Calientes to Ollayantaytambo the next day, as we wanted to have as much time in Cusco as possible for our last night. That train was a NIGHTMARE! We were seated in the first two seats of our car, so our knees were touching the wall in front of us and we couldn't even put our feet flat on the floor. It was a torturous 1.5 hour trip, complete with... FASHION SHOW! I'm not kidding. Train staff actually modelled various alpaca sweaters to the beat of some generic techo music! If we weren't so uncomfortable, we would have found it amusing I'm sure. We wished we had skipped our night at the Sanctuary Lodge and just returned to Cusco on the Hiram Bingham the night before - it's that good!"

We enjoyed the Ghan train in Australia and the Blue Train in South Africa but were very disappointed in the Hiram Bingham. The bus from Machu Picchu dropped us off some distance from the train station with no directions on how to find the train. When we found the train we were seated at a table for four. When we showed them our tickets, we were told that the seat numbers did not mean anything. No one offered to seat us at a table for two. The bar car was small and the few tables were quickly filled. The car swayed so much that you had to hang on to the bar while having a drink. Dinner was a set menu with no choices. If you did not like trout you were out of luck. The food was edible but not enjoyable. Service was indifferent at best. The staff was curt, looked bored and did nothing to enhance our experience. The next morning a couple we had met at Machu Picchu came to our table at the Monasterio and expressed similiar frustration with the train. It is hard to believe that the hotels and the train are operated by the same company.I would reccommend that you stay at the hotels and take the Vistadome."

Right from the pre train drinks at the Poroy Station, through the beautiful meals, first class service and stunning scenery we could not fault it. As part of the deal you get a guided tour of Machu Picchu, lunch at the Sanctuary Lodge as well as the train ride. As we said in a review about the Sanctuary Lodge we would rather have two trips up to Machu Picchu on the Hiram Bingham than stay up at the lodge."

            "review": "Hiram Bingham experience. I am totally perplexed after reading Champagnetraveller's unfavorable review of the Hiram Bingham train ride from Cusco to Machu Picchu. Our experience was the opposite of his/hers. From the moment we landed in Cusco (after a very nice LanPeru flight), we were taken care of completely. Edwin, the driver assigned to us by HB for the duration of our stay in Cusco, met us at the baggage claim, handled our bags and took us in a minivan to our hotel. (Novotel...be sure to get one of the bigger and nicer \"Colonial\" rooms). After checking us in, he explained our itinerary and helped us book additional excursions. We chose a private city and surrounding area tour, and a group Sacred Valley tour. Although I drank tons of water and choked down a lot of coca tea, the altitude problems hit me pretty hard around 3am the first night. My husband was fine. Neither one of us drank while we were there; it just seems to hit some people harder than others. Exedrine migrane was only a small help. In retrospect, I should've asked for oxygen at the hotel which is always available. Edwin picked us up at 0810 the next morning to take us to Poroy's station where the Hiram Bingham leaves at 0900. There were local dancers there and once onboard, more local entertainment for the duration of the trip. We did not experience anything negative on the trip AT ALL. The service was gracious, the food was surprisingly good, our included guide for MP was great, the post-tour tea at the Sanctuary Lodge was wonderful, and the oxygen they offered me on the train to MP cleared up my awful headache in 5 minutes. During the ride you're able to go to either the bar car or the observation car with an open back to the tracks for some beautiful views of the Peruvian countryside. MP itself IS awesome. Of course the fact that we had perfect weather with no fog had a lot to do with our experience. The only rain we had was on the train back to Cusco, and by then it was dark anyway.  One suggestion about the HB: even though they do offer a nice brunch on the way to MP, it's not served 'till 1100, so you might want to have something small at the hotel before you go. We saw the other 2 trains in Aguas Calientes (sp?), and they seemed fine. They leave sometime around 0630 from Cusco, so they both arrive and depart before HB. Be sure to book as far in advance as you can for HB if you decide to take that route. Yes, it's expensive, but at this stage of our lives (50) we decided it would probably be a one-time deal, so we bit the bullet and economized elsewhere.  At the end of our Cusco stay Edwin took us back to the airport for our flight to Lima where we joined the ship in Callao. All in all, the trip was hassle-free and we had a blast."

Although Incarail was not responsible, we were given no information about the expected lengh of the delay and had to wait in a crowded station until more than midnight. Some information would have allowed us to have some rest at a hotel instead of staying in a cold station. On a more positive note, we were given food and Incarail organised our tranfer to Cusco by bus at our arrival in Ollanteytambo."

Once at the train station the transition is smooth with just the short way early in the morning there's a coffee stand there to help you to get something to eat or drink before you leave. The train ride is about an hour and ten fifteen minutes and goes through Scenic Countryside which is good. You get a small snack on a train and something to drink and you really arrive in Machu Picchu before you realize it. We came back that night. The problem there is there only two trains through Inca rail many many trains to the other line. We waited 4 hours for a train at the train station. We came back in the dark quite exhausted and I accidentally left my camera on the train. Despite many attempts to get it back through contacting the management and the train station and the travel agent all failed. I said the trip was good the only problem is that I did back then there's another hour and 30 minutes because now it is dark and the bus goes a little bit slower. Again the people on the train were very helpful and provided a small snack and information while we were on the train just not information I had to get my camera back. The overall experience was good but I did not like the long bus rides to and from Cusco to the train station and I definitely did not like the long wait at the train station in Machu Picchu to return via.

            "review": "Great experience. Visited Peru on a business trip. Was there for six days and decided to visit Macchu Pitchu on a clear day off. After some research we discovered the cheapest and easiest option was with Inca Rail. The return ticket from Poroy station on the outskirts of Cusco to Machu Picchu cost \u00a3130 each with a premium economy ticket. The only train is at 05:55am and it returns leaving Matchu Picchu at 16:20 arriving back into Poroy at around 1930hrs the train journey is roughly 3 hours each way. There is another option from Ollantaytambo station but you would need to get a bus /taxi from Cusco and it would take a few hours as it was over an hour before the train stops there en route. We booked our tickets online with Inca rail and had to print off the confirmation which had to be presented at the train station with the credit card you paid for the tickets with in order for the Inca rail staff to issue your train ticket. We arrived at Poroy station at 5am and the Inca rail staff were not there. The lady turns up about 5.15am so don't panic at first if there is no one there. She sets up inside with her laptop in the seating/ waiting area not outside in the ticket office. They advise you to be there 30 mins before departure to collect tickets. There is a coffee shop selling drinks sandwiches and cakes and there are also good clean toilet facilities. The train itself was only four carriages and it was full. There are toilets on board and staff served complimentary drinks and a sandwich which was needed at that time in the morning. Announcements made in Spanish and English. They also play pan pipe music on route but this was quite loud and annoying as a few of us wanted to sleep. We asked if they could turn it down a little and they did thankfully. You cannot walk between the carriages so if your group is split between them you cannot walk through to see them. The seating arrangements are tables of four so you might have to sit and face someone not in your party. The scenery is breathtaking. During the three hour journey we were served complimentary drinks twice, soft cold drinks or tea and coffee. On the return sector we had biscuits and cake. The staff are very helpful and the facilities are good. When we arrive at Aguascalientes train station it's right in the centre of the town has toilet facilities but it's quite confusing at first as you have to walk down through a market stall area and everyone is rushing to get to the bus queue for Macchu Pitchu so it was a little stressful. My advice would be to get off the train ASAP and take a brisk walk to the bridge which takes you across the road where you can buy your bus tickets. If you are travelling in a group split and get people in the bus queue while the rest buy the tickets. We queued 20 mins to buy the bus tickets then another hour to get on the bus up. You can buy tickets for MP in Augas Calienties tourism office ( you need your passport) but I strongly advise you buy before to save yourself a lot of time and stress. Doing Macchu Pitchu in a day is doable on this train was our best option but it involves spending two nights in Cusco as the flights do not tie in with the train times. It was very tiring but 100% worth every minute if you are limited for time. Only hiccup was the hotel receptionist in Cusco told us it would take 40 mins to Poroy station. It took ten mins so we were at the station way too early !! We think she meant 14 mins not 40!!!! An absolutely fantastic experience overall top tips book your train tickets online in advance if you can to ensure seats as they were very busy from Poroy and get off train on arrival as quick as possible to avoid huge queues."

The seats were comfortable in the train -- leather seats and windows wide enough to see the breathtaking views no matter where you are sitting, though its best to get a window seat. I was definitely in awe and did nothing but soak in the beautiful scenery.We met a sweet cleaning/maintenance lady named Sonia who worked for inca rail who was in our train, very nice and gave us brief history of the incas and really knew the ride well and what we were looking at out the window. She is really nice and knowledgable so if you happen to see her on the train, say hi to her and ask her questions! She knows her history. This train ride is relaxing... Just be open to whom you may be seated with...and just try to enjoy everything!

The Inca Rail cars were nice and comfy and staff the friendly. We thoroughly enjoyed both our trips with Inca Rail."

IncaRail offer cheaper fares, and that's why i chose it. Still, i found that IncaRail trains are less attractive than the competitor (from outside) and i was expecting much more from an 85$ one-way trip (i travelled Machu Picchu-Poroy). Yes, they serve some snack and even some (alchool free) cocktails (both of them tasting a little odd to foreigners), but seats are somehow cramped and not so comfortable (you'll find by far better seats in most of the bus company travelling Per\u00f9) and the overall feeling is to be in a train of the '80, that's not either modern, nor vintage, simply a bit outdated.I really feel they should lower their fares."

Only negative aspect is that we had to arrange out trip around the train timetable as both Inca Rail and Peru Rail have a very limited schedule from/to Cusco that did not leave much flexibilty. Agree with comments made by other reviewers that it isn't clear why trains do not go to Cusco more central station but stop in Puroi which is a good 30 minutes taxi ride. To the least, It would be nice if Inca Rail (and so Peru Rail) would offer a connecting service (but/shuttle) from/to Puroi from Cusco."

            "review": "Rougher ride than Peru Rail, skimpy meal. Unlike most of the other reviewers, we actually took the Vistadome from Peru Rail to go from Ollanta to Aguas Calientes, then took the First Class trip on Inca Rail for their 7 PM dinner trip down, so I was able to make a direct comparison. Not that this return journey was terrible, it was just that the Vistadome experience was superior. First of all, getting the Inca Rail tickets is more troublesome than the Peru Rail tickets. Unlike PR, which has offices in the Lima and Cusco airports as well as in Cusco town, the IR offices are only at the train stations, and their hours are quite limited. In addition, they weren't even staffed during the posted hours (employees leaving early), although we were able to get our tickets for the return journey 90 minutes before the train left. The PR trains are built better than the IR trains, in that these have significantly more side-to-side sway than the Vistadome train did. This was especially bothersome when trying to get to the rest room. The seats were quite comfortable in both trains, though. My biggest complaint with the IR First Class service was the skimpy dinner. The only protein was thin slivers of trout carpaccio. The main dish was a light vegetarian dish with mushrooms and potatoes. After hiking around MP, we were hungry, and, for the large premium we payed from the First Class tickets, I felt ripped off. I guess with a vegetarian dish, they don't have to worry about being kosher, halal, or almost any other religious dietary restriction, but I wasn't happy. The service was friendly enough on both train services. None of the trains to Aguas Calientes accepts luggage, so my advice would be to spend 2 nights in Ollanta, take a morning Vistadome up and an evening PR train down."

About the food service: The Andean cocktail, Tropical cocktail, Lemon grass ice tea and coffee were excellent. In addition, a small packet of bread sticks (in executive class) was ok, but I wish we were served something more substantial instead- like a sandwich. Overall a good experience. But it can be improved by a notch with better food."

Having traveled to Machu Picchu a little over ten years ago on a very uncomfortable and slow train, I was ready to have a not so great experience. The opposite was true, actually. The seats were very comfy (so comfy that our entire group fell asleep on the way back), the snacks were tasty (sweet crackers on the way up, trail mix on the way down), and the beverages varied and delicious (almond tea, herbal infused soft drinks, juices, etc.). Ticket purchases (online) and pick-ups (in person on the day of the trip) were quite simple. The only complication is the issue of seating. We were a group of four and, on the way there, we were split up (two in one row, two in the other) instead of grouped together, which seemed odd. On the way back, three of us were grouped together and one person was dropped into the middle of another group. We simply requested to trade seats with another guests and fixed the issue ourselves, but it seems like it would be an easy fix for the company itself to take care of. One would assume that groups would like to be seated together--especially on a special trip like this one. Otherwise, I was very happy with the train ride up. Note that the way up/down is winding and bumpy, but that has more to do with the terrain than the train."

Wanting to pamper myself a little, I booked the Executive Class and was particularly looking forward to this part of my trip to get to Machu Picchu. I boarded at Ollanta and reaching my assigned seat found that each of the four seats in this section were full. I pointed to my number on the wall and a woman across from me said \"they are a couple and want to sit next to one another (referring to the two sitting closest to me with their backs to me). I replied that this is where I was assigned and if they are going to sit there then I have no seat (not seeing any seats that were open). I left to get the conductor to ask what I should do.When I came back with him the 4th person had disappeared and \"my' seat was now open (on the aisle). The young girl had moved to the other window, next to what I assume was her mother. The young man sitting next to the other window has this giant dreadlock man bun and all three looked at me as if to say \"what you do mean your seat has been taken\"? So I sat down. The area under the common table had been all taken up with their belongings and no room was left for my camera bag (which is pretty large) and I scrunched it onto my lap. I was in the last table/section of the train and now facing backwards from the direction of travel. The only thing I could see if I looked straight ahead was the back of the train/bathroom and to my left the man bun mountain that eclipsed the window for the most part. The train got underway and I could catch glimpses of scenery going past but man bun was moving his head to block my view whenever he could with a twisted little smirk. So much for my being able to take any photos of this part of my journey or video (I specifically brought a separate video camera just for this part of the trip).The train rocked back and forth (side to side) much more than I expected. This was not exactly an issue for me but I point it out in case it may affect others with motion sickness. The staff was friendly and professional, and the food offered was very good, albeit similar to what is served on a plane; simple snacks and drinks but they were good.On my return trip I boarded the train to find a young girl in my seat, next to her obnoxious and arrogant little boyfriend. Really? They asked if they could sit together. I just grumbled and took the seat next to the window. It was dark and I wouldn't see much anyway. Then the train started; I would be riding backwards for the next 90 minutes again...................."

In addition, the numbers for seating needs to be better identified as sequential seats does not necessarily mean that the seating is grouped together. We traveled in a group of 4 and thought that the sequential numbering put us at a table for 4. Not the case. Very dissattisified with the seating arrangements. Other than that, the train broke down mechanically and we were stranded for 2 hours. the views were spended!"

The only reason I am only giving 4 out of 5 is because of their office in Cuzco being closed due to a holiday. We knew the office would be closed the day OF of Peruvian independence (28th July) so we purposely scheduled to pick up our tickets the day after. However, the office was closed on the 29th as well forcing us to wake up very early to drive to their Ollantaytambo office. We were unable to leave from our original destination out of Cuzco as well as our original time. I wish that there was some sort of disclaimer to warn foreigners of their holiday office closures. I suggest that you do your research and make sure that the office will be open to pick up your tickets before you purchase your tickets. Other than that, the train ride and ticket pick up in Ollantaytambo was smooth!!"

I was expecting something much better for first class and for $198 a piece for one way ticket. The kids menu wasn't offered as promised, and the main course was only vegetarian.

Service on board the train is non-existence other than a very limited offer of hot beverages and 'healthy' bread-sticks or nuts which were stale. The entire machu picchu experience is a big let down, as it has become nothing more than a tourist trap."

We were waiting to board the 11:15am train when an employee asked us for our tickets, he checked our names and told us to follow him because we would have been changed of wagon \u2026. we were confuse \u2026. two minutes later we were advised that we got upgraded to first class!!! It was a great surprise, my girlfriend could not believe it. We had lunch on the train: Pisco sour as welcome drink, then a three course gourmet lunch!!! This lunch was much better than the one we had on the airplane (flying in business) back to Lima few days later! Thank you Inca Rail and a special thanks to its employees for making our trip to Aguas Calientes unforgettable!"

I found out that a day trip to Machu Pico is too short if you are planning to hike one of the mountains surrounding Machu Pichu and also visiting the Citadel. Taking the train in Poroy is much easier than in Aguas Calientes. Poroy is about 25 min from the center of Cusco and you need yo get there by taxi. To take the 4:16 PM train from Aguas Calientes back to Poroy , I recommend being at the bus stop in Machu Pichu about 1 hour and 15 minutes before the train departure, as long lines are formed at that time from people also trying to catch the same train. Next time I will stay one night in Aguas Calientes ton avoid the rush."

The Executive class was a bit cheaper than the PeruRail Vistadome. However, the cars were older and you had no choice of seats, so many families were seated separately. You could not request a forward facing seat if you get motion sickness, and in our car the A/C constantly dripped on one poor pax despite staff's continuously stuffing it with towels. The snack was a small package of dried fruit and nuts and several non alcoholic drinks were offered, but you were only given one (prior reviewers have said one hot and one cold). The windows were MUCH smaller than Vistadome so view would have been greatly inferior, though after dark this makes no difference. During the day it would have been much more important. Glad we did Vistadome for the morning trip to AC. This was fine for return and it runs later."

We got to Aguascalientes about 9:00 a.m., walked through the market place, across the river to the waiting area for the bus and waited in line for approximately 20 minutes. Not a bad wait, but it was obvious that the bus ride portion of the trip was a surprise to some travelers."

The service in the delux car - in both directions -was fantastic. We traveled very early in the morning, leaving from Cusco by bus to Ollantaytambo to connect with our train. Both Peru Rail and Inca Rail depart from that station, and all the trains are very timely. With Inca Rail, we had a great view in a comfortable car. There was a wonderful food and beverage service that allowed us to get some more hot mate de coca, which is supposed to help with the altitude. Overall, I highly recommend Inca Rail."

This means you are sat opposite complete strangers and leg room is very reduced and awkward unless you fancy crossing legs with a complete stranger. Why they cant just make it like an airplane so that you can use the space under the seats in front of you, I have no idea. Most people travelling were in couples so putting people on tables of four is a bad idea. Furthermore you cannot pick you seat. You are simply allocated a seat and this meant I was on one table with three complete strangers and my wife was on another table with three complete strangers behind me. My number was something like 24 and she was 25 but they were not next to each other. They badly need to address the seating plan. There should be more seats that are not table seats and there should be an option to chose what seat you want. Such simple things made what should have been an unforgettable journey a bit of a nightmare. If you look at my other reviews you will see that I'm not the complaining type and I hardly ever rate anything below three stars but this was such a disappointment I think it is justified."

There wasn't anything wrong with other company but (with the other company) I did feel a bit like a sheep being herded into the train, and was placed miles away from the rest of my group. With Inca Rail the whole process of booking tickets and collecting them from the Ticket Collection was easy and efficient. They gave my family and I a free upgrade to First Class on the way there which is always a great thing. I love Inca Rail's philosophy of having the seats face each other... it is so much nicer this way in my opinion as you can talk in a group more easily and this helps you engage more with the scenery. The staff are outstanding... whether it be taking photos for you, telling you in advance when highlights out the window are coming up, or assisting you onto the train and suggesting where to put your luggage. At the end of the trip to Aguas Calientes, they provided a complementary insect repellent which was a nice touch. As for the first class meals, they are just outstanding. All other things being equal, I'd choose Inka Rail just for the seating arrangement. However they are also cheaper and friendlier to deal with. As the newer company in the market they are obviously working hard to establish a good reputation, differentiate themselves from their competitor and increase market share. I am glad I took advantage of this on my second trip to Machu Picchu."

Luckily our method of rail travel was Vistadome, which is the picture attached. There are many adjectives that could describe this trip, beautiful, relaxing, smooth, wonderful, exciting. The carriages were extremely comfortable and the vistas absolutely eye-popping. Continuously, the Pruvian countryside never ceased to amaze. The trip down to Aguas Calientes (sometimes called Machu Picchu Pueblo) started at 6:30am from Poroy, north west of Cusco. Travelling down through the various valleys down to the Urabamba River, and then along to Aguas Caliente following the river. Seriously, what a wonderful way to travel, particularly when your expectations are sky high as to your final destination ..... Machu Picchu.Our return journey was the following day, leaving at 3:30pm. The thought of finally sitting down for a relaxing 3 hours return trip back to Poroy was wonderful, we had been on our feet from 6:00am that morning. The trip back was so relaxing that I slept for an hour. This was sorely needed. Not only did we spend 6 hours in the Citadel, we walked down to Aguas Caliente, just to be different, and we spent 2 hours shopping at the markets at the station.Without a doubt, the Inca Rail trip was the best way to travel, and our choice of Vistadome was also the right one."

For us this was the booby prize of being bumped from the Belmond Hiram Bingham Orient Express train, for which we had purchased round trip tickets through our booking agent. Apparently, the business decision to bump a party of 6, in favor of larger groups, was just too enticing for the Peru Rail executives, who operate the Belmond train. Being devotees of PBS, Agatha Christie, Hercule Poirot, and David Suchet, this train was a critical piece of the Machu Picchu experience.The presidential car comfortably seats 8, and must be booked in advance, since it does not run every day, and it is a charter. Do the math, chartering the Presidential Car is $1250 for up to a party of 8, while the Bingham train can run between $300 and $400 per person, depending upon time of day.The Presidental Car has its own wonderful staff led by Hugo, who will meet you at the station and escort you to the Car. Your chef will prepare your meal, which you will enjoy from upholstered swivel club chairs, and polished banded yew wood tables. On warm sunny days, they open the sliding side doors so that you can view the countryside from the brass Juliet balcony. Very nice.Since we got bumped both ways, our return train was Inca Rail First Class. This was a dinner train, and very pleasant. While in my mind, we were definitely cheated, Inca Rail treated us very well."

The staff on the train were great, not sure why, but about ten minutes after our coffee one of the staff came and apologised because the coffee wasn't hot enough, to be honest, we didn't notice.Return trip was animated with staff providing us with the ten ways to wear one of the wraps they had for sale, was really funny."

It was a comfortable and beautiful ride and probably the only way to get there if you are not hiking. They do serve you a snack and drink. The only negative thing I have to say is that we returned to the town of Urumbamba when it was dark, and you could hardly see the steps from the rail car to the floor.....so that part was kind of dangerous. They need to have lighting right by the steps as you exit the train. Peruvian Rail does not allow large luggage. Check their website for size requirements. If you want them to hold a bag because you came from a hotel to the train station, they will do that for you so that you don't have to lug your unneeded items at Machu Picchu."

Tickets are very expensive and you don't get much on the train. Snack is very poor, as one perhaps would expect, and seats are not that comfortable. Having said that, the tickets were cheaper than the other option and for this we were glad. Also, taking into account that most people visit Machu Picchu only once in a lifetime, this is a price you pay without complaning much. For this reason, I don't think I can give less than 4 stars, even though I didn't feel it was a 4* service."

Most trains to Machu Picchu only start from Ollantaytambo (and not Cusco) these days, except for the Vista Dome, so plan to leave your hotel early enough to allow plenty of time. We took the Expedition train, less expensive and yet very clean, comfortable and with plenty of view from either side. I suggest you ride on the left side seats for views along the river. On the day of our trip, this and other trains were an hour late. The station was unusually crowded, but the staff of Peru Rail was helpful, offering free hot coffee, tea or coca-leaf drinks, a welcome gesture on a very cool morning. The train ride itself was very comfortable, and scenic along the river all the way to Machu Picchu. There was a brief stop to let passengers off who wanted to hike the famed Inca trail. We loved the train ride. I suggest you to use the toilette in the train before reaching MP, so you can go straight to waiting buses for the 30 minute ride up to the top. As you can expect, sometimes the lines are long as the train brings in many tourists. Our tour guide was excellent and we all rode the same bus to the top. Don't worry, after your visit to MP, there will be plenty of time for eating and shopping before taking the train back in the evening (unless you plan to stay here overnight). Loved the train ride and free soft drinks and pastries."

The bathrooms were very clean. The service from the personnel were nice. Everyone was smiling. Going to Aguas Calientes the train swayed quite a bit. Like another review, the train follows the river so sit on the left side going to Machu to get better pictures. They have a drink snack service. I think they have some of the best coffee :)Once you get off the train you walk maybe 3 minutes to the bus that takes you up to Machu Picchu.Coming back the economy wasn\u2019t as roomy but honestly I took a nap and woke up with a little less than an hour in the journey.

They serve drinks and appetizers during each ride from Ollantaytambo/Cusco to Aguas Calientes and back. It is about a 3 hour ride from Cusco to Aguas Calientes and train is definitely faster that using a car. On the way back to Cusco, the attendants put on a fashion show.

Needless to say, we were very stressed at that point, and the staff immediately greeted us with some chilled sparkling wine. The train ride was bumpy, but the glasses were held in place by a very nice looking set of heavy, stable coasters. A very nice gesture to relax after a stressful moment.This was in the executive cabin, and the return trip in first class had even better food and drink.All in all a great travel experience."

First of all: the prices are extortionate!!! 120$ for getting to Machu Picchu and back is ridiculous. But it's the cheapest way if you're coming from the sacred valley. I took the tourist class and could book my seats the night before for good times - though you should plan in advance how much time you wanna spend in MP and Aguas Calientes, respectively. The train itself was quite okay. The windows could have been cleaner, but the seats were comfortable and at least they offered a drink and a snack inclusively. The suspension of the train isn't the very best and neither are the tracks, so parts of the ride were quite bumpy. However, the seats were comfortable. The view, of course, is amazingly incredible! If you want to take pics, ask for a window seat and have your camera ready to shoot all the time - taking a good picture can be a challenge in a moving train and there's plenty of trees that pop up on the track's side just when you thought this is a good scene!"

When i flew into Cusco to ride the railway,i travelled from sea level up to 3352 m and a hundred years back in time. Cusco is an unspoilt city of Spanish colonial baroque architecture resting on a rock-bed of Inca masonry. We plumped for the Monesterio Hotel,hidden amidst its cobblestone warrens. This is the favourite base for railway aficionados. And i got to tell you,roasted alpaca in this high altitude is heaven. In the morning,at 6.30, the Vistadone begins its climb from San Pedro Station on one of the most scenic and historic railway journeys i have ever undertaken.We growled up through the chaotic,red mud-brick barrios that cling to the hillside. Cusco spread out before us,all the tile roofs framed by the peaks of the Andes. Near the top of the grade,we spiralled around a horseshoe curve to El Arco summit,3677 m, where the train ducked through the ruined arch of an 18th aqueduct. then through a series of 'loop-de-loops' to Poroy and the flat fertile Pampa de Anta. The haunting music played over the sound system as snacks were served,while the narrow gauge carriage swayed. Ascending to the last zig-zag in the gorge of the Rio Vilocona,we rolled passed the Pachar depot.  Ahead lay the deep,dark,green Urubamba Gorge and the Cloud Forest,habitat of wild orchids,hummingbirds and the endangered speckled bear,all the way to Aguas Calientes,to surge like lemmings for the waiting buses for Machu Picchu. Pictures cannot convey,no matter how many photos you have seen of the ruined city clinging to the sheer mountain top in the jungle mists... the scale of the ruins. The crowds vanish among the houses,temples and palaces,visitors appear like specks on the grassy boulevard to to the young mountain,the peak dominating the view. the weather alternates from hot and sunny to cool,damp and dreary as clouds and mist drifted by,enhancing Machu Picchu's deep mystical aura.... like a Pompeii in the sky."

After endless phone calls, as well as emails in which they were very unresponsive, they emailed to state they did not receive all the funds and was missing $75.00. We had Bank of America investigate this and they stated that Inca Rail did indeed receive ALL funds which was confirmed by their bank in Latin America. When we attempted to show them once we were in Peru all of the documentation, they completely denied it and told us that we must either pay the $75.00 again or lose all of the monies transferred and thus not be able to take the train. The other available train, Peru Rail, was completely full prior to the whole wire transfer issue so we had no choice but to pay the money again.I would have rather booked with a travel company."

Peu Rail is everywhere, but Inca Rail ended up being the cheapest. We were very happy with the results.We took the Cruz Del Sur bus from Cuzco to Ollantaytambo. The bus \"terminal\" is about 100 yards from the train station. The bus is timed perfectly to drop you off about 30 minutes before your train departure, which is also when the gates open to wait for the train.We stayed in the executive-class (\"E\" class I believe), which is actually the same as the \"first\" class. The train cars itself are very nice...just enough space to squeeze yourself and a backpack through. There's also a small luggage rack to put your bag if you don't feel like putting it at your feet (there's plenty of room for feet & a backpack at the table, though). The cabins have about 20 four-person tables. Each seat is actually quite plush. Each table has a big, open window that you can slide down and watch the beautiful cloud forest go by. There are skylight above you as well so the cabin is very well lite.The cabins are very clean--more so than some airlines--and after your train embarks on it's voyage, you'll soon get food & drink service. The food service is a small-ish yet delicious sandwich & treat, and there's a large beverage selection. All this is provided free-of-charge. The staff on the train speaks passable english, too.The train ride itself is beautiful. I think this isn't a reflection of either of the rail providers, but rather the environment. The two hours it took to go from Ollantaytambo to Aguas Calientes went by fast because we were too buy watching the raging river underneath the train, the mountain peeks above it, or the forest going past it. We had the window all the way down and were snapping pictures like crazy. Inca Rail's moto is something along the lines of \"creating lifetime memories\" and it's true...you'll be treated great, and will spend most of the time focusing on the breath-taking train ride.We also rode Inca Rail back to Ollantaytombo from Aguas Calientes after we visited Machu Picchu. This is where my only complaint about Peru Rail comes in: the terminal must be completely subsidized by Inca Rail, because with the exception of the Inca Rail ticket office outside the gate, there's no other mention of Inca Rail within the station. Peru Rail announces all it's train departures & arrivals, but Inca Rail doesn't say anything, nor is there any posters or posted info. We had to ask a terminal employee if we were at the wrong train station. When she said \"no\", we attempted to go out on the train platform. We were stopped by a security person, who looked at our ticket, then hustled us into a corner with other equally-confused Inca Rail passengers.I highly recommend Inca Rail. The trains are beautiful, the rides are beautiful, and it's a very comfortable & relaxing trip. With the exception of the confusion at the Aguas Calientes station, there's no other complaints. Just be cognizant of your train's arrival & departure when at the station, and you'll be fine."

They told us at the travel agency of our hotel, if you make it to Aguascalientes (the last train stop before Machu Picchu), they have to sell you an entrance to Machu Picchu. Our travel agency at the hotel helped us buy some of the entrances and train tickets, but we still needed the bus tickets and 2 entrances to the site. It was no big deal to do it once we got there. Make sue you bring your passport especially if you are under age, they have a special rate for students."

We were served drinks by attentive and polite cabin staff. There was a clean bathroom and a place to store backpacks. Honestly, I looked into the other cars to find out what more I could get from a higher-priced ticket, and the cabins themselves looked exactly the same. The only reason I am not giving this five stars is because of the limited amount of coaches available at certain times of the day. We wanted to change our ticket to later in the day, and were told that the mid-afternoon train only has one car. Still, it's a great experience for the price. Don't splurge on the Executive or First Class, stay with the Tourist car."

Unfortunately, on our particular trip there'd been a mudslide on the train tracks so all our travel plans to Machu Picchu had to change.Rather than helping us, the manager at Inca Rail office in Cusco insisted on charging us a 10% \"cancellation\" fee to change our train tickets. We said the mudslide wasn't our fault. She said it wasn't hers either. We finally paid the fee on the return trip because she was adamant and we had no choice. The other train company, \"Peru Rail\" didn't have availability, so were stuck with \"Inca Rail\" no matter what.God forbid you ever have to go into the Inca Rail office at Plaza Mayor in Cusco. You will wait. And wait. And wait. And wait. And wait to be served. You may or not get a person with a bad attitude after that.Due to the mudslide, we unfortunately had to go to Inca Rail 3 times to get everything straightened out. We basically lost a day of travel waiting to be served at Inca Rail. But as Inca Rail has a virtual monopoly on ways to get to Machu Picchu, you're forced to swallow whatever they dish out.As it turns out, going by rail is the ONLY way to get to Aguas Calientes (Machu Picchu). We didn't know this at first and assumed we could find a car or some other way to get up there. There's not. There's just rail. That's it.Interestingly, when we were finally about to take the train the next day in Ollantaytambo, we saw locals waiting for a different train. They told us they take a different train made especially for locals--and pay about $3 to ride it. That train is hidden from tourists' view.We paid $100 per person, round trip.So clearly there's some sort of game with the trains and with the fact that there's no road directly to Aguas Calientes. They make a lot of money charging tourists for train rides when there's not offering an alternative way to get up there.The actual experience of riding the train once you're in it, is really nice and relaxing and beautiful, but dealing with the Inca Rail office really left a bad taste in our mouths."

My wife and I took the backpacker train from Cusco to Machu Picchu since the reviews indicated that the views were very similar to the Vistadome train. I booked the tickets six months before the trip to make sure that we had seats on the train. Once on the train, we had 2 seats our of the 4 seats that were facing each other. The problem is that the amount of leg room for these seats are the same or smaller than the 2 person seats that are on the rest of the train. We ended up on the seats that were facing the direction opposite of that the train was traveling. However, it was on the left side so we had great scenery as the train hugged the side of the mountain on the side of the river. The 2 hour train ride was nice and scenic, with the train making a few stops. They provided snacks of plantains and tea/coffee. For our train ride back, we were not seated together - my wife was sitting with someone else in a 2-person seat. I got stuck again in the seats that were facing each other. But there were 2 military men that took the Inca trail that were sitting next to me and we had a great 2-hour conversation on the train ride back to Cusco, so I can't really complain. The 4th person was from Peru, and he too was seated separate from his companion. Peru Rail should allow people to select their seats, like the airlines, instead of randomly assigning seats and separating couples. Any seats number over 45 on the backpacker train is on the seats facing each other (there is only one set in our car). Maybe if you purchase your tickets at their office in Cusco, then you can select seats, but internet users are not as fortunate. Otherwise, a nice train ride."

You have to travel to Poroy to catch it and then the same on the way back from Agua Calientes to Cusco. Poroy is about a 20-30 ride from Cusco (depending on traffic). Another alternative is to take a day trip from Cusco to Ollantaytambo, visiting all the places in between (Maras, Moray, Chinchero, and the fortress at Ollantaytambo - hiring a guide, driver and vehicle that can accommodate up to 8 passengers, will run about $250.00 for the day (this is about a 10 hour day, with all the visiting) - entrance fees and gas included and they will drop you off at your hotel in Ollantay - lunch extra, if you stop for one - so splitting the cost with others makes it very cheap), then stay over night in Ollantaytambo and catch the train the next day to Agua Calientes/Machu Picchu. From Ollantay the train will take about 70 minutes (and Peru Rail is very good about running/departing/arriving to the minute on time). Trains from Ollantay run almost hourly, from about 6:00 a.m. Then book your return train trip direct to Poroy (then taxi or bus from Poroy into Cusco) or get off again in Ollantay and take one of the many taxi vans that wait to pick up customers here (they'll cram 8 to 12 into one van, then drive about 90-120 minutes to your drop off in Cusco - not sure of the cost). It's about $35.00 cheaper this way, per person. There are three levels of train you can take: the Hiram Bingham (far too over priced for what you get $300.00 per person, per direction from Poroy), the Vistadome (much better price - snack included, runs a lot like a plane, with stewards, etc. - great service, great scenery from large windows and glass roof, which they constantly keep clean - about $90.00 per person, per direction) and the back packers (same as above two, but less nice - about $60.00 per person, per direction). The second and third options are just different cars on the same train (yes, your ticket is for a specific seat in a specific car, not grab any available spot). NOTE: many companies will offer car service to Machu Picchu from Cusco - it doesn't exist. The road you take past Ollantaytambo is a dirt track beside the train line only as far as the hydro station, then you walk the last 5+ km (3+ miles) beside or along the train tracks to Ollantay and the path beside the tracks is RIGHT BESIDE the tracks. You better move well back when a train is coming."

We were able to prove that we were there on time and that we were never notified of the departure, but she didn't care and was very clear about it. We purchased the new tickets with Peru Rail (much better service and way more comfortable) When we arrived to Cuzco, we went to the Inca Rail office, we explained the situation to the person they had in charge. The guy was extremely rude and had the same \"it's not my problem\" attitude that the woman at the train station had. One rude employee could be just a person with a bad attitude. 2 rude employees (in two different locations) clearly demonstrate that the company has poor customer service and only cares for the sale and not the satisfaction of its customers.Inca Rail is cheaper, but I highly recommend spending a few extra dollars and use Peru Rail instead."

I found it to be very spacious and actually discussed how comfortable I was with the friends I was riding with. The ride was very pleasant and the scenery is amazing. There is food, but it's only light snacks. We (my group of 9) didn't care at all as we had food in our bags, and the ride is only a few hours anyway. Who wants to actually eat a full meal on a train when there are so many new and wonderful restaurant options to try in the area? Not us, that's for sure.If you want the highest in luxury, pay for the Hiram Bingham. If you don't want to pay an absurd amount of money for just a few hours ride, this is the next best thing. I will offer some advice though. Inca Rail lets you choose which \"level\" of ticket you want. If you like alcohol, pay for the ticket which includes drink service. The lower level tickets serve non alcoholic drinks and that would be fine if the trip only lasted the amount of time that it was supposed to. However, our ride had a 2 hour delay. There was a tree down on the tracks, and we found out that this is fairly common. So, had I known that delays are common, I would have purchased the option with wine so I could have at least sipped on some wine while sitting and waiting on the tree to be cleared from the tracks.Again, this train is very comfortable and I didn't find myself wanting for anything (except wine). I would absolutely choose it again, and would enjoy it once more."

Peru Rail and Inca Rail websites provided schedules but info was basic. We found the best option was to take a combi from Cusco to Ollantaytambo. This was fast, cheap and safe. Passengers were a mix of locals and foreigners. The locals kept the driver in line with driving laws and speeds. I felt safe using the combi.  IncaRail seating is crowded with passengers facing each other with a table between them. It is narrow and knees will touch as you try to sit comfortably for the ride. Friends traveled Peru Rail and said seating was much better, no one facing them and passengers were offered a beer or wine on the trip at no additional charge. There is a minor price difference between the 2 rails. For better comfort use Peru Rail."

When organizing your trip to Machupicchu, all you hear about is Perurail; however, Incarail is a great alternative--it goes from Ollantaytambo so this may limit some, but if you have time, Ollantaytambo is a great place to start from, a lovely Incan town and much less expensive than Cusco. Incarail is much smaller and newer, but you are treated very well and chances are you'll have a lot more space if you go with them. For $5 more, you can go \"executive class\" and be treated like royalty (almost!). Check them out!"

A couple of the crew members model alpaca clothing they try to sell you. A person dressed in a costume dances around to some loud music.

However, seats 5&6 are directly behind the driver's cab and we only had 6\" leg room so had to reverse the seat back to travel backwards (all the other passengers were travelling forwards, airline style). Luckily two guides were travelling in seats 3&4 and swapped seats with us, one of them stood for almost the whole journey as there was so little room in our original seats.One our return we had the same seat reservations. The train was larger giving plenty of legroom but again an obstructed view behind the driver's cab. There is entertainment on the return with very loud and repetitive music (same tune of about 3-4 minutes played on a loop about 30 plus times).We were really looking forward to this part of our trip so were very disappointed.

After endless phone calls, as well as emails in which they were very unresponsive, they emailed to state they did not receive all the funds and was missing $75.00. We had Bank of America investigate this and they stated that Inca Rail did indeed receive ALL funds which was confirmed by their bank in Latin America. When we attempted to show them once we were in Peru all of the documentation, they completely denied it and told us that we must either pay the $75.00 again or lose all of the monies transferred and thus not be able to take the train. The other available train, Peru Rail, was completely full prior to the whole wire transfer issue so we had no choice but to pay the money again.We have forwarded our complaints to Peru Tourism as well as the Ombudsman at Conde Naste Traveler as there were other individuals we spoke to prior to the train departing that also had problems in which Inca Rail had charged them for additional fees on their credit cards.

We did not use Peru Rail for this journey, but we did use them for a trip to Puno, so we have some idea about their service as well.Going to Aguas Calientes, we used the less expensive option. On the return trip, we used the most expensive option. In either case, they were considerably cheaper than Peru Rail and they run on the same tracks and use the same stations.Regardless of price, the view is great! Let me describe the differences in the service levels in the two options.The cheapest option has four seats per row. It's not abnormally tight seating unless you're a quite large person. They serve what is essentially a box lunch, of decent food.The most expensive option has three seats per row. The service is better and you essentially get a nice restaurant meal along with wine.The price difference when we went was $50 vs. $75 per person. We thought the extra $25 was worth them money. Either choice will get you to the same place. Our service was very reliable.By the way, it was very easy to make reservations from the United States using their Verified by Visa process (contrast this with my review of PeruRail)."

Fortunately we had a friendly couple opposite us and even had a good conversation throughout the journey.The expedition on the other hand was terrible. It's blocks of 4 seats as per the Vistadome, however they are much closer together and therefore 2 adults cannot comfortably sit opposite each other. Unfortunately we had an extremely rude couple opposite us who would not move at all and with the sprained ankle I had it made for a long, uncomfortable journey as my feet were pushed up against my seat!To improve this, couples booking tickets should be seated opposite each other so they can share the leg space, not next to each other.Do not book expedition for any legs of this journey - shell out the extra amount and go for the Vistadome.One other thing I wanted to point out, I originally selected Vistadome going there as I thought it was the only train with the extra windows on top of the train - wrong, the Expedition does have that too!"

Train departed from Aguas Calientes full of different insects. I was bitten by them dozens of times, despite using deet. Crew did NOTHING, not even closed the windows. Passengers had to organize themselves in order to fight with the plague. Service was super poor considering the price of the ticket. Train itself was very very slow and arrived with nearly 1 hr delay to Poroy. In Ollantaytambo the engine broke and we had to stop there for some time. Of course, not even a glass of water had been offered to us. Continuing the journey, hard to believe, I know, but... 5 wagons suddenly detached!! No safety at all!! Two wagons continued, stopped and returned in order to re-attach the remaining wagons. Arrival to Poroy was even worse. Chaos, a lot of strangers, darkness. We didn't book any taxing as we were informed that it's easy to catch a taxi there for a price of ca. 25 soles. What we were offered was min. 40 soles. Taxi drivers are there only to cheat the tourists arriving by train. Do not expect PeruRail to help you - they don't offer even the basic shuttle service! If you don't speak Spanish and arrive to Poroy after sunset you just wanna cry there! Zone isn't nice, all dark and you need to struggle to find a taxi to Cusco, being exhausted already by a long train journey."

We took the Vistadome from Cusco to Ollanta and then we took Expedition from Ollanta to Cusco on the way back....We enjoyed the Expedition service, the train has more luggage space behind the seats than the Vistadome. The Difference in price between Expedition and Vistadome varies, in regards to the difference in service is a snack. As a constructive criticism, the snack could be changed to an item that might represent the country more as far as flavor and ingredients.Peru is full of amazing flavors. The service from the train station to the train itself were great. When making a selection between Vistadome or Expedition i would base it on the train time. Get to the train on time (30 minutes prior to departure) so you can store your bags behind your chair if not you'll have to store it in a single rack which is used by all. Have fun!"

None of this was communicated to passengers who were called into the boarding area in the baking heat and provided with no information whatsoever for half an hour. We were then told that we would board the train but that we would not be moving due to there being no engine. Once we had boarded the train Peru Rail provided absolutely no communication to us. Nothing. After an hour I asked a attendant to communicate with passengers about the problem and to provide information about how long the issue would take to get fixed. No information was provided. We sat in Aguas Calientes station for 3 hours until the train finally left. Considering the cost of the ticket - the most expensive I have paid for a train ever - this was inexcusable. I understand that problems happen however the lack of communication made everything 100 times worse. Most people on the train had just done a trek at Macchu pichu and were very tired. Additionally when we finally arrived at Ollanta Station over 3 hour late, no one bothered to apologise for the delay. I will never travel with Peru Rail again."

The Expedition did seem to have more stops for the one tracking. Maybe they give the other expensive trains more priority to continue their path. Not sure. The train ride did seem like it was pretty long. But we did end up getting to our destination as advertised."

Our tickets were USD74 per person which were actually USD9 per person more expensive than our Vistadome tickets, (a better train with a better snack service & entertainment\u2026) On Vistadome we received a small salad, a fruit and a juice whereas on the Expedition, we were given a cookie and a small glass of cola.The windows are pretty much the same as those on the Vistadome with the exception that some of the seats were windowless. The train line follows the river through much of the same surroundings, so it\u2019s not the end of the world not to have a window right next to you, especially for the return trip, as you\u2019ve basically seen it all already. There is no fashion show or entertainment in either direction on the Expedition (only on the return trip on the Vistadome).The seats were spacious and comfortable and they\u2019re group together in fours (two groups of two people facing each other over a small table) \u2013 pretty much the same as the Vistadome. As we were staying two nights in Aguas Calientes, we needed to take luggage in excess of the allowed weight on the train, and it was very easy to get approval by Email prior to our trip. That said, no one checked or questioned our luggage\u2026 Announcements on the stations are only in Spanish (and not very audible) and there are no electronic arrival or departure boards, so we could not understand what was going on or where we had to go, but the staff were very friendly and helpful, so we just asked them and managed to get on the right train at the right time.

Since we had a large group and they only had 8 beers stocked on the car, our awesome staff (Nestor and Danissa) borrowed from other cars and radioed ahead to the midway stop to have a few more cold ones ready for our group. Danissa showed and explained some traditional Inca music and dancing. These may seem like small things, but their concern for our comfort and making sure we had a relaxing trip home was a really nice gesture. I obviously recommend seeing Machu Picchu (absolutely awe inspiring - as expected) and since you have to be on a train for the 7-hour round trip, PeruRail was as comfortable and friendly as you can get.

It was very epensive and we would have had to consider walking the 30 odd kilometres were we not availing of a 2for1 promotion on their website. The website is reasonably well laid out, at first it may be unclear which number train you need but there is a pdf you can download with all of the times and numbers. You then send your request and an operator emails you back very promptly and from there you are in good hands. The train itself is very modern if not a little cramped. There is no space for large luggage but the station has a free storage service we could use. There are also luggage racks on-board for smaller bags. The journey to Machu Picchu was lovely, the train moving at a nice pace to take in the views out of the many windows on the sides and ceiling of the carriage. There was a free tea/coffee/water service with a small traditional cake as well as additional souvenirs for sale. The return journey was at night so the train driver put the pedal down which made the journey a little rockier. This did not stop the many tired explorers in our carriage from sleeping soundly. The gentleman accross from me sleeping unsoundly, his snoring almost louder than the train. We were offered the same tea service as on the outward journey, all included in the price of our ticket.All in all we were content with the service but still felt it was a little expensive given it is the budget train option (for tourists) and that there are very few alternatives to getting to Machu Picchu, a site everyone should be able to e\u00f1joy."

There are almost too many different options and it is tough to really make the appropriate selection for yourself. There are also lots of changes that they make seasonally that you must be aware of. A huge plus was the service personnel. On the train, the people are friendly and multi-lingual. They will do what they can to help. We had to leave on an earlier train than scheduled. Generally they do NOT do this. Again, the human element here was superb. Jesus, the train supervisor and Johnathan helped us out in a big way, as we needed to get back to Cuzco earlier for a number of reasons. Thank you Jesus and Johnathan! You helped save the last leg of our Peru trip!"

Ollantaytambo is located about 1h30 away ( it took us about 1h15) from Cusco so plan your departure accordingly. If you take the early morning train and haven't had breakfast, you can buy coffee and croissants / sandwiches at the train station / waiting room. When the train is ready to board, they make an announcement. The train is quite comfortable, it has Windows on the side and roof. Seats are blocks of 4 (2 facing each other). There are no rack on top of the seats but a main one as you enter the wagon. The journey can either be 1:15 or 3:30 depending on where you take it from ( Ollanta or Poroy). The taxi driver told me that 90% of people preferred departing from Ollantaytambo as the train journey was quicker. That makes sense as the Poroy station is about 20-30 mn from Cusco + the 3h30 train journey. During the journey you are served a coffee and a muffin, service is good but very basic. "

Boarding is orderly and efficient with staff directing you to the correct door and a ticket and passport check is made before you board. The train travels quite slowly (just over 3 hours each way) so there's plenty of time to appreciate the surrounding countryside. The seats are comfortable and are numbered and allocated with your ticket; a table separates the seats and then once aboard you are offered a hot or cold drink and light snack both of which are included in the price of the ticket. The toilet facility on board is clean and can only be used whilst the train is moving. The stewards are friendly and helpful and on the return journey they bring merchandise round; books, cds, t shirts, scarves, ponchos etc. It's a lovely way to travel to Macchu Picchu."

They immediately handed me supplies I needed to vomit, which I did, and they took care of me every step of the way. I had originally had plans to travel that night from Cuzco but I was too sick. Gleem, called the travel company himself, on his cell phone, I might add, and explained to them what had happened and the state I was in. Gleem, also called a hotel for me and booked a room where I wanted to stay. They continually kept checking up on me. Vera was very kind and concerned. Gleem also assisted me in getting a cab after the train ride! He called a co-worker, Estaban, to confirm that they could get a cab for me. Gleem also informed me that it was cold and to make sure I had my jacket on, when the train stopped, he helped me carry my things and escorted me to his very kind co-worker Estaban, who found a cab for me that would take care of me and wouldn't over charge me. They are amazing! I am so very grateful for them and all of their work and assistance, thank you a thousand times!"

They also offer you a snack (tasteless muffin or their traditional cookie wrapped and baked in paper so it was almost impossible to eat the cookie without paper) and drinks - inca cola, coke, teas, coffee, water etc. There is a storage in the train you can leave your backpacks (we didn\u00b4t know there was this storage in each train so we only took a small backpack but if we knew we would definitely take more staff with us!). The train looks new, nice seats but the tables make it a little bit uncomfortable. The ride is about 3.5hours and you will see amazing nature of Sacred Valley.

We had an incident during our return trip from Agaus Calientes (AC) that the peru Rail staff handled spectacularly.We had a 16:22 train from AC for which we were at the station at about 16:00-16:05. The lady staffing the gates into the platform didn't let us in saying that it was only Inca Rail passengers who were boarding now. This, we later found out, was entirely incorrect as our Peru Rail train was boarding at that moment! Peru Rail also failed to make a last call announcement (we checked with our co-passengers later and none of them had heard one, whereas they had heard last call announcements of other trains). So we chilled out at the station waiting to be called upon. When they opened the gates for the 16:43 train, we were let in and then told that our train had departed and we had missed our train. We panicked as we had to get to Cusco by 22:00 when we had an onward bus to Puno etc. The station manager (we forgot his name!) for Peru Rail was super patient and waited to see if there were any no-shows. He found a couple of seats and put us on the 16:43 train apologizing for any inconvenience caused.All this while we had to tell our tour operator who had sent a car to Ollantaytambo about all this (we didn't have local mobiles). Our wagon attendants, Zulema and Lidia, were spectacular in helping us out. They got the numbers and details from us, went up to the train engine, radioed the Tour operator and passed on instructions to our driver in Ollantaytambo. Both Zulema and Lidia were very very helpful and very gracious in their interactions. We were able to, enjoy the sights of the Expedition train and get in time to Cusco to make our train! All thanks to the great staff that Peru Rail has. Although, the confusion between Inca Rail and Peru Rail at the Aguas Calientes station should be sorted out to prevent any such occurence in the future!"

This was rain seson, so PeruRail used bus instead of rail for the first part between Cusco and Aguas Calientes (approx. 2 hrs,) which was OK (safety first!). The train ride is not exactly fast, but punctual, and it gives you the chance to observe the wonderful nature, as the roof of the train has large windows. The personell from PeruRail was exceptionally friendly, and promoted a high level of service I'm not used to from my country (Norway). Thanks to Felipe for adding positives to a truly unforgettable trip, including the most astonishing place I've ever seen. :)"

The views are good with the windows along the sides and ceiling. Considering it's pretty much the only option to get to Machu Picchu, unless you hike, it's pretty nice. They do hand out free beverages and snacks, which is nice. I would book tickets in advance unless you want the very late train."

Beautiful attractions and the train it's very precise with the departure time. If you take the train from poroy to Machupichu I will recommend it as you avoid a 2 hour travel in carExpedition class it's around $68 -$70"

He said Peru Rail had more trains running than Inca Train.We booked the Vistadome train for our early morning trip to MP and the Expedition train for our return trip which was the latest on in the evening. We agree with a lot of others that all of the trains seem to be charging fairly high prices for the length of the trip ( compared to a lot of other trains in many other countries) but sometimes you have to pay the price if you want to use the service. The Vistadome train was extremely good- excellent views of the scenery on route, fantastic service and information from the staff and overall a very enjoyable, relaxing journey to Aguas Calliente. We took the return trip on the Expedition because it was the latest train leaving Aguas Calliente and it was a bit cheaper but the ride was quite different from the Vistadome. The engineer seemed to be in a big hurry and the train bounced a rocked abit as thye seemed to trying to travel as fast as possible. The service was okay but far less that the Vistadome. Maybe if we wouldn't have been on the latest train of the day it might have been different but we couldn't recommend this train like we will for the Vistadome."

People were friendly and helpful, it was a positive experience for our small group. Tickets could have been simpler but all in all not a hassle.The only comment I have is make is that if you are going sight seeing, make sure you take the train during daylight hours. Once it is dark or rainy, the windows do not offer a view, just cooler temps inside the cars. Really enjoyed the trip, we are planning on our next trip already. We will take advantage of more of the stops the train makes and stay at more of the locations that the train stops at. Take your time and explore (hike/walk) more of the areas that Peru Rail offers. Really wonderful trip, and would recommend it to anyone considering Peru."

Tip- they only accept back packs on the train- NO suitcases. Also, ONLY bring PERFECT US dollars- no marks, no tears, no fading, etc.. Only get bring brand new US bills to Peru- banks nor exchange houses will take even the slightest of dollar blemishes. Found this out the hard way."

We enjoyed out ride into Aguas Caliente through farmland, small towns, and ruinshe along the river. The seats were very comfortable for the 3+ hour train ride.There were plenty of windows to be able to take in the views. As the train gets started there is a definite rocking of the train due to the narrow tracks, but it smooths out after it gets going. We wound through farmlands, small towns, and small homesteads that were refreshingly totally self sufficient while at the same time very humble. There was obvious poverty but at the same time very homey. Donkeys, pigs, chickens, horses, and cattle rounded out the landscape. Some children were leaving for school, all in their matching uniforms as nice as any exclusive private school uniform, and so clearly well taken care of. An interesting contrast from their humble homes. The tracks run next to the river that cuts through high granite canyons and eucalyptus groves. Saw breathtaking cliff hanging pods for mountain climbers to rest. There were a few ruins visible from the train. While rolling along we did jerky to an abrupt stop twice due to brake issues which were quickly solved. Remember, and repeat-it's an ADVENTURE! Deep breath, patience, and we were on our way again served a light snack and drinks. Enjoyed their unique way of backing and going forward to negotiate going down hill. The scenery became more lush, and soon we pulled into Aguas Caliente. We met new friends on the train and loved the scenery and our adventure. Congratulations to the lucky ones who get to experience this! Enjoy your trip!"

We have recently taken the train to MP, the scenery is amazing, while traveling the train made an sudden stop (an animal was crossing the rail road) so the coffee that I just got served was spilled on me. Enzo and Sherli did provide a good service on board and help me to clean the mess. On the flip side it takes over 3 hrs to get to MP from Cusco for a 90 km ride, if you are seating in a 4 people table the room for legs is really limited and there is no overhead compartments to store your back pack or bags, so plan your day carefully to make the most of it."

Clean bathrooms on board, and snacks offered (crackers, cookies) along with simple drinks (water, juice, soda). FYI: Some seats are arranged facing another row. Our seats did not, just lined up to the backs of another row.Seats were very comfortable and restful (I wish airplane coach seats were as nice:-)From what I understand by asking others (including a taxi driver)...train service does not go to Cusco, but rather passengers would need to depart from either Ollantaytambo or Poroy stations."

I always say a traveler's enjoyment of any activity or accommodation depends heavily upon 3 factors: -your preferences-your expectations-the company you keepThat being said, I took the Expedition train back from Aguas Calientes while traveling with a friend and we were in awe of everything we saw and did there, bearing in mind the fact that we understood that this foreign country is DIFFERENT than the US and does not always offer the same basic comforts to which we are accustomed in the US. . .Here are my thoughts:Pros:-extremely fun and friendly staff-scenic trip with large Windows-we sat in the very front of the train and were able to see the best of the scenery - the staff was friendly and chatted with us, particularly Paola and Rogelio. -Later, during the fashion show, they pulled me \"backstage\" to be part of the fashion show, modeling an alpaca serape. It was fun. Cons:-It is expensive. I reserved on-line and the economy Peru Rail train was sold out. I bought the tix ahead of time, worried that they'd be sold out when we got there, as is the current thinking... However, there were plenty of tix available the day of, and cheaper prices. Bummer. -The train was stopped to accommodate roadside peddlers, and the on-board \"fashion show\" - a frivolous attempt to infuse a bit of culture into a soft sell approach to peddling expensive fine alpaca clothing items. If you are in a hurry, book the cheapest train to avoid this 30 min delay. In short, any of the trains suffice. Take the cheapest. But if a better window view and friendly staff are important to you, take Expedition. If first class service and dining is your preference, take the Hiram Bingham train for 3 times the price. *Recommendation:Go in off-peak times. 1. Off season is summer - June, July, August (winter in Peru). This is the DRY season in Cusco and much more conducive to hiking and other activities. It is very cold at night, though. (With alpaca blankets in the hotels/motels, it's no problem sleeping) 2. Go TO Aguas Calientes (base of M.P.) in the late afternoon/night, stay the night in AC and head out to MP early (6am) before the first trains, rife with tourists, arrive. You will have gorgeous pictures without hoardes of people in the back AND foreground. 3. Return to Ollantaytumbao (Sacred Valley) early the next morning or before noon. Tickets will be easily available at those times as most tourists try to make MP a one-day event. * MP tickets ARE available the day of...However, they are no cheaper than they are on-line, so if you are sure of the date you wish to visit, I recommend buying them on-line. They are not cheap. . . Something like...$130 US dollars...can't remember exactly...** If you like a short (1.5 - 3 hr) adventurous hike with an exceptional view looking down at MP, buy the Huayna Picchu tickets on-line (at least 4-5 months in advance, due to limited access -only 400 people per day vs the 2,000+ that visit MP daily...). Bear in mind these tix sell for a separate, more expensive price. But...they SAY one day, in the near 20-year future, MP will only be viewed from a glass observatory as tourists will no longer be allowed to trample and degrade the site. Go now. While you still can. I was unable to secure any HP tickets, as the website had been hacked and was subsequently shut down for 3 months prior to my visit. Total BUMMER. 2nd option: Putucusi's Ladder It's free, and located at the edge of the town, Aguas Calientes. I also missed out on this because it had rained recently and parts of the ladders were washed out. Double bummer. Please do these activities for me. I will live vicariously through you . . .Happy travels. "

The views and terrain are lovely. Take some food and drink for your self on the trip. The train up to Aguas Callientes from where you catch the bus up to Machu Picchu takes up much of your day. The return trains don't leave until late afternoon so it is good to bear in mind when planning especially if time poor. Aquas Callientes is a very cute place but when you are sitting around waiting for a train with luggage/backpacks it is annoying. Staying in Callientes is one option but the same applies except the hotel will look after your bags. One way of avoiding the long train trip is to get to Ollantaytambo by road and catch the train from there. Be aware that is seems most people get up early to get to the top before sunrise so there are long ques for the bus from 5.30am."

Sounds painless but when we got to the train station and were just about to board the train with the passes we had, which I was under the impression was for 2 people, we were told we only had a pass for one person. All despite the fact I specifically asked more than twice for a ticket for TWO people. Of course i take partial blame for not paying closer attention to the ticket upon purchase, which is why I say, be 100% sure you get what you're asking for upon purchase. Everyone is so quick to want to please and get your money, they'll say yes to anything that they think makes you happy. On the bright side, the train ride itself was more than pleasant, clean, and the staff was extremely helpful, courteous and professional at helping us sort out all the confusion with the ticket issue and got us to our final destination on a high note. :)Definitely use Peru Rail!!!"

It is the reason why we ran into these problems in the first place."

I\u00b4ve never encountered such kind-hearted and helpful staff on any travel service ANYWHERE in the world, and I was shocked by how genuine their concern was that we made our onward journey. Thanks to everyone, and a special mention to supervisor Carlos Ruben...you guys are great!"

We had a problem with incorrectly issued rail tickets which meant we were not allowed to board our train. Of course we got rather \"stressed\" by this but Alfredo, who speaks excellent English, immediately called our tour agents and was able to secure new tickets on a following train. Whilst we were delayed by 2 hours we were still able to have a late afternoon trip to Machu Pichu. The help from PeruRail personnel was excellent and \"saved the day\"."

I organize my trip alone, (without travel agency, because is more expensive), I had spoken highly of the trains going to Machupicchu. When I bought my tickets I obtained information on the two railway companies at plaza de armas in Cusco. In the end I decided to buy my train tickets in Perurail because Estela helped me a lot, she gave me all important information to make my trip on myself. The staff on the train was so kindly, roof windows to see the beautiful landscape, meals was only thing I didn\u00b4t like. I recommend Perurail service and staff for the professional way to help the tourists to Machupicchu, thank you to help me make my dream come true!"

We started our journey from Cusco and were told via several emails that we would travel via bus for the first part of the trip because of the rainy season. The bus station was within walking distance of our hotel so we walked and were greeted by a couple gentlemen directing people through a gate to the station. It was early morning, still dark out, but the station was well lit and the employees were very friendly. They checked our tickets and passports before we boarded and again after we boarded. The buses were clean and comfortable and they handed out bottled water during the ride. The bus ride to the train station was fine, the intermediate train station was okay. We had to wait a bit to board the train but once on board and en route to Aguas Calientes (Machu Picchu) the journey went quickly. Service on the train was excellent, they serve drinks and a snack which is enough to call a meal IMO. Bathrooms in each car. Comfortable seating, and some of the best views of the region. Keep your camera out and ready! The station at our destination was very well kept, including the bathrooms. Make sure you make use of them before wandering out into the markets or going up Machu Picchu where you'll have to pay to use a clean restroom. Our journey back was just the reverse. You can purchase snacks and drinks at the station in A.C but they again served a large snack and drinks on the train. During our return, they played a folklore story on the intercom and one of the service employees came out in costume and danced. This was followed by a fashion show and an attempt to sell the merchandise. I enjoyed the dance but not the overpriced merchandise. They weren't pushy at all, I just don't think it's necessary.I would ride the Expedition with PeruRail again with no hesitation. Comfortable, great service, great views along the way."

Sandro, Aliceman, and Geraldo not only got us a ride to Cusco, but Sandro personally walked us many blocks in the pouring rain to our Hostel, we were then sent to another location and Sandro again personally walked us to our final location. We have never experienced such extraordinary kindness before anywhere! I have traveled a lot and I have to say that Peruvians are The most sincere and empathetic people ive ever met. And these 3 new friends went above and beyond any employee duty for us."

Extremely rude and a poor example of a Perurail employee. Not only would she not make eye contact, she alughed with her colleague when we could not understand her Spanish though she was able to speak English. She gave us inaccurate information which cost us and was a bit of a joke amongst travellers we met along the way.On the other hand the staff on the train and at the station were nothing but courteous and helpful.

The only difference I could see from the Vistadome and Expedition is that Vistadome serves a small breakfast on the way and refreshments and snacks on the way back. It was a bout a 3 hr train ride each way and is very comfortable and clean. The views are beautiful\u2026 best part of the trip. The service team \u201cGerardo, Kateren and Sandro\u201d were very polite, attentive and provided excellent service and attention. On the way they performed a mini fashion show and other entertainment (which travelers are made part of). Very fun and funny!! The only downfall was our return trip where we were stuck about 1.5hr because the rain caused a landslide. The team kept us informed as to the progress in clearing it up and provided us with more refreshments and snacks. This is definitely the best way to travel to Machu Picchu."

Probably one of the most scenic train rides I have ever been on less the Tiego del Fuego train ride in Ushuaia, Argentina.I stayed a week in Peru and a couple days in Aguas Calientes near Machu Picchu. I jumped on the Peru Rail from Ollantayambo to Aguas Calientes. It cost $117 round trip and I left Tuesday at 1:30p and returned Friday at 4:30p. By the way the later you travel the cheaper it is, I gues because you can't see anything at night.Other than the cost being a little high, everything else was pleasant. There aren't any outlets on the train for the passengers and my iPhone 5 was at 3%, one of the attendants plugged it in the back without even thinking twice. Very nice gesture as I was full before I got to Aguas. The train looked newer and clean running on gasoline. The weather was perfect at 64 degrees and a little rain. The scenery was lush green mountains and a river of brown water from the rain from Cusco which played a beautiful ambience for the ride.They served a snack which was soda or water with a cinnamon roll and a tiny ham and cheese sandwich that was good.They tried to sell you some shirts, hats, photos, and maps but weren't to persistent when you said no thank you. Didn't bother me, others might call this a tourist trap. All in all very decent. If they had this train rhnning on solar power, free wifi on board, outlets for customers and a little cheaper they would have got a top rating in all categories. My photos should give you a better idea of the ride. Enjoy! Safe travels!"

I recommend purchasing the tickets online, then picking them up at the Peru Rail office located in the Lima airport when you land. If you are flying straight to Cusco via Lima you can still do this as the Peru Rail office is located right near the domestic gates.As far as the type of trains to take, we took the Expedition there and Autovagon back - it mostly depends on your timing needs but we personally found no significant difference between the trains. It's short ride and extra expense doesn't seem worth it for the Vistadome. The snacks they give are quite tasty."

While in line, a man behind me asked if I was trying to change my reservation. When I confirmed, he said good luck, he had tried earlier and they wouldn't let him. Not only that, they told him they didn't have any space on another train. He went back to his hotel, went online and easily bought 2 tickets to the train he wanted. Now he has 4 tickets, 2 for a train that he is not going on and they will not refund him.  After my pointless attempt to change my train, we noticed the tickets that the man werent using, were for a train that we could use. We both go to the ticket counter and explain that he is not using his tickets, there will be 2 empty available seats, and we would like to exchange. No dice. The workers are worthless.

On board they served a snack, I think it was a small serving of pasta salad and corn bread with a small drink, and had a small fashion show. They cranked up the music, the type of flute mucic we heard in many places in Peru, and had somebody dressed in some kind of costume that maybe was an Incan medicine man or something. They had a couple of crew members model alpaca clothing and offered them for sale. We did not get this on the Inca Rail train. This did make the time go by faster but I certainly would not make my decision to take PeruRail just to see this show. In my opinion the scenery was nice but not fantastic but you have no choice if you want to get to Machu Picchu without hiking the Inca Trail. I would give a slight edge to PeruRail over Inca Rail but it is so small that I would probably go with the train that I could save the most money on these overpriced rides."

            "review": "NO BIG SUITCASES! Booking problems. Altitude strategies.. Based on my recent trip to Peru, I have divided my comments and thoughts about Perurail into various topics below. I hope this is helpful!LUGGAGE:At some point, I\u2019m sure I was told that we wouldn\u2019t be able to bring our big suitcases on the train to Aguas Calientes (Machu Picchu). Unfortunately, I had forgotten that little detail, and we had to scramble at the last-minute to repack our luggage and move clothes and gear for 2 days into our day-packs. We booked an evening train, and during the day we had a private guide taking us around the Sacred Valley. He dropped us off at the train station in the evening, and that\u2019s when he told us we couldn\u2019t take the big suitcases. He said that after dropping us off at the train, he was going to take our big suitcases to the hotel in Cusco where we would be going in a couple days. That worked out fine, and a couple of days later when we eventually got to Cusco, our luggage was there, as planned. I\u2019m not sure what you are supposed to do if you don\u2019t have someone to take your luggage for you. Anyway, it was a big pain and caused us some last-minute stress, but it all worked out. Interestingly, I met several other people who also \u201cdidn\u2019t get the memo\u201d, and had to scramble at the last minute. (And see the end of this review for a funny story.)So, my obvious recommendation is to plan ahead, and gracefully solve your luggage problem before the last minute!! DON\u2019T FORGET: The trains just have a couple little shelves that will hold everyone\u2019s little day-packs. There\u2019s no room for big suitcases.BUYING TICKETS:Another challenge we faced was making the reservation and buying the tickets. The Peru Rail website looks easy, but it\u2019s not! The site isn\u2019t set up very well, and it doesn\u2019t work very well. It also requires information like passport numbers, which usually aren\u2019t handy. The worst part is that I would finally get all the way through this very long process of entering all the information, and on the final screen my credit card would not be accepted! AAAAHHHRRRGGG!!! I was pulling my hair out.I tried several cards. I believe the official explanation is that they only accept cards with \u201cVerified by Visa\u201d or \u201cMastercard SecureCode\u201d. However, I couldn\u2019t make any of my cards work, including one that were a \u201cVerified by Visa\u201d card. (Later I heard other people had the same problem.)This was a HUGE pain, and I spent a ton of time screwing around with that website, trying to make it work. At one point, it wasn\u2019t clear to me whether or not my transaction had gone through, which was even worse, since I didn\u2019t want to end up buying two sets of tickets accidentally! Finally, my wife actually called them up on the phone, and she was able to get it done. She speaks Spanish, so this was a reasonable approach, except for the high cost of the long international call.In hindsight, I should have just let our tour company book the train tickets. I figured I would save a few bucks by doing it myself, but in this case that was a big mistake!! For this vacation, I booked some things myself, but I used the Peru For Less tour company to book other things which would be harder for me to do (e.g. private tours). In general, I liked doing some of the bookings myself, and that probably saved me a little money. However, I should have let the tour company book the Peru Rail tickets. Trying to book it myself was a nightmare! The tour company offered to book the train for me, but I foolishly declined. Live and learn.Booking the train through a tour company has the added advantage that they should help you deal with your extra luggage (e.g. take it to your future hotel for storage). We got lucky in the sense that even though the tour company didn\u2019t book the train tickets, we did have them drop us off at the train station after taking us on a private all-day tour around the Sacred Valley. So, the tour company was involved with getting us to the train station, and they helped us handle the luggage issue. I don\u2019t know what we would have done if we had gotten to the train station on our own.Anyway, use a tour company to book your Peru Rail tickets! We used Peru For Less for quite a few things on our trip, and we were always very happy with their service, guides, and arrangements. I can definitely recommend Peru For Less because I had such a good experience with them, but I\u2019m sure there are countless other good tour companies, too.PICKING THE TRAIN:The only way to get to Aguas Calientes (the town by Machu Picchu) is by train, so in that sense you don\u2019t have a choice. However, you do have a choice with respect to which train you take. There are cheaper options like the Expedition, more expensive options like the Vistadome, and insanely expensive options like the Hiram Bingam. There are also different package options which include various things like meals. The Hiram Bingam package not only includes meals, but also the Machu Picchu tickets, guides, and entertainment. I believe that option is for people who just want to go to Aguas Calientes and Machu Picchu for the day, and don\u2019t want to worry about any arrangements. Personally, that seems like a waste of money because it\u2019s really expensive. Also, I think try to do Machu Picchu as a day trip from the Sacred Valley would be too rushed.Another option that I can\u2019t recommend is to get a package that includes a buffet lunch at the Sanctuary lodge. We had the buffet lunch at the Sanctuary Lodge (although not part of a train package), and in our opinion it was not worth the cost. The food was not that good, and it\u2019s pretty expensive. There are snack-bar options nearby which would have been just fine, and would certainly have been a better value.In our case, we picked the cheapest Expedition train, primarily because of the schedule. The seats were comfortable, and the ride was fine. I\u2019m not sure it would have been worth more money for a \u201cnicer\u201d train. The ride was bumpy at times, so it\u2019s possible that a different train might have had a smoother ride, but I don\u2019t know. And I\u2019m not sure I would have paid more for a smoother ride anyway. Both the ride and the view on the Expedition were fine.If you can select your seats, consider that most of the time the tracks follow the river, which is on the left side going to Aguas Calientes, and the right side coming back. Our train was configured with groups of 4 seats around a table, so half the people were riding backwards, which is another consideration.ITINERARY:We did this:Tuesday day: Sacred Valley tourTuesday evening: Train to Aguas CalientesWednesday day: Sunrise at Machu Picchu, and all day exploring the ruinsWednesday evening: hot springs and nice dinner in Aguas CalientesThursday morning: Train back to Sacred ValleyWe wanted to go to Aguas Calientes in the evening, so we could do Machu Picchu at sunrise. That worked out great, and I would recommend this approach. The ruins get more and more crowded during the day, and by afternoon there were hundreds of people everywhere. The first hours of the morning were the best.So, we went to Aguas Calientes on Tuesday evening, did the ruins first thing Wednesday morning with our Peru For Less guide, and stayed at the ruins most of the day. Then we spent Wednesday night in Aguas Calientes, and took the train back mid-morning on Thursday. This worked out perfectly for us. It was nice to have the entire day to enjoy the ruins without doing any traveling on that same day, and we went to the hot springs and had a nice dinner Wednesday evening after the long day hiking around the ruins.Note that taking the train to Aguas Calientes in the evening meant that it was dark. That turned out to be fine. We got to see the sights on the way back. ALTITUDE CONSIDERATIONS:This is one aspect of our trip that I would have done differently. We flew from Lima to Cusco, and then immediately went down to Urubamba, which is much lower that Cusco. (It\u2019s better to go up in altitude gradually over several days.) However, Urubamba is still very high compared to Lima, so we were a little bothered by the altitude.I had the right idea by immediately heading lower from Cusco, but I didn\u2019t realize when I was planning the trip that Aguas Calientes and Machu Picchu are actually lower than Urubamba. It would have been better to go directly to Aguas Calientes, and do the Sacred Valley sights after Machu Picchu.Here\u2019s what I wish we had done:Monday morning: fly to CuscoMonday afternoon: train from Cusco to Aguas CalientesTuesday: Machu PicchuWednesday: train to Ollantaytambo, and begin Sacred Valley sightseeingAfter touring Sacred Valley, continue to Cusco (higher) and then Puno/Lake Titicaca (highest).This itinerary has the added advantage that you get to take the train down from Cusco into the Sacred Valley, which is supposed to be a very scenic trip with switchbacks, etc.When you are looking at train schedules, keep in mind that the Cusco train station is called Poroy. I read somewhere that it is about a half hour taxi ride from the Cusco airport, but I would allow plenty of time in case of flight delay or traffic.When you arrive in Ollantaytambo, there is a nice little pizza place on the right immediately after you exit the train station gate. This is a tasty and efficient option. Also, if you are going to the Ollantaytambo ruins, they are pretty close to the train station. It would be a reasonable walk.In the Sacred Valley, I would highly recommend the Maras salt ponds, Awana Kancha Llama/Alpaca farm, and the Pisac market. The Pisac market was the best shopping we found on our whole trip. Allow half a day, at least. Feel free to skip the Pisac ruins if you are tight on time. After Machu Picchu, they might be very unremarkable.DON\u2019T FORGET:As I said before, you need to pack a small day-pack or overnight bag for your train trip to Aguas Calientes. We had to scramble at the last minute to re-pack our luggage and extract what we thought we would need. In our haste, we successfully got most of what we needed, but we missed a few things. We remembered all the clothes, hiking gear, hats, sunscreen, cameras, toiletries, tickets/passports/etc. However, we forgot our bathing suits for the hot springs, and mosquito repellant. (Yes, there were some mosquitos at Machu Picchu.)FUNNY STORY:We were chatting with other travelers about the fact that you can\u2019t take your big luggage on the train, and a guy named Brian told us his funny story. Brian was with a large tour group that was traveling around for many days by bus with a guide. All the arrangements were part of the tour, so he didn\u2019t worry about the details. The night before they caught the train to Aguas Calientes, they stayed in a hotel in Ollantaytambo. Brian remembered the guide telling them something about leaving their luggage at the hotel the following morning when they took the train, but he didn\u2019t really hear all the detailed instructions. So, the next morning, he left all his luggage in his room, grabbed his camera and headed out the door for a nice day trip to Machu Picchu. As it turned out, he had missed the part of the instructions about packing an overnight bag for the overnight trip to Aguas Calientes. Not a day trip! Oops! So, here he was spending the night in Aguas Calientes, and literally all he brought with him was his camera. No change of clothes, no pajamas, and no toothbrush. I felt bad for him, but he was laughing about it. At least it made a good story to talk about later!"

We were lucky to get front facing seats both ways. Got served a small breakfast with coffee and tea option on the way there and a slice of pizza on the way back. On the way back the staff had a fashion show with some clothes you could buy after. Train was clean and had comfortable seats also was on time both ways. Bying the tickets online was no problem and I picked them up at Cusco airport where Perurail has a counter in the arrival hall. Perfect thing to do when waiting for luggage to come on the belt. If you choose not to pick your ticket up at the airport there are other options availeble, all easy to find. Tickets are not cheap but I guess they are worth it. We would choose Perurail again and recommend you try if you are visiting MachuPicchu and dont want to walk the Inkatrail."

The problem is that we were sitting in the train station for over four hours with no idea if the trains would run that day. There is no communication except for an announcement that says \"we're working on this and will get back to you\". We finally arrived in Poroy at 2 am in the morning, raining, with a shortage of taxis. I highly recommend that you do not plan any travel arrangements immediately after a train ride and make sure that you have a taxi waiting for you in Poroy."

However, they have really worked hard to make the whole experience a pleasurable one. Firstly, the online booking system is very user friendly and well designed so it won't be a hassle or ordeal booking your journey(s).I travelled from Ollantaytambo (90 soles by taxi from Cusco, or around 15 soles by colectivo). They have managed to capture that mood of train travel from the classic days. The seats are large with plenty of legroom. Drinks and a snack (a quinoa and pastry dish) were served by very friendly crew, and bottles of Cusquena beer are available for 10 soles each. The journey was 90 minutes along the Urubamba River on a single track for most of the route.I was lucky enough to have seat number 1, which was right at the very front of the first carriage (adjacent to the drivers compartment) so the view couldn't be better.But yes - it is a very expensive train journey.

Last week my girlfriend and I were traveling through the Sacred Valley for a few days with our final stop being Ollantaytambo before heading to Aguas Calientes via rail. Even though we ran into a few issues, the staff smoothed things over and ensured a pleasurable experience. We arrived at the Ollantaytambo station early in the morning with the intention of dropping off our luggages prior to a day of touring the local ruins. When we arrived to \"check\" our bags for the train we were informed of the weight limitations (11lbs per person) and were forced to consolidate bags. Essentially you cannot take large luggages on the train to Aguas Calientes-- make sure you are prepared for this. To make matters worse, the attendant was extremely confused on what to do since we didn't fill out the required forms or make prior arrangements. After a 20 minute exchange in 1st grade-level spanish we mutually agreed to leave one of the bags (mine of course and not my girlfriends) at the Ollantaytambo station and that during the 5 minute stop off on the way back from AC to Poroy, I would jump off the train, find the right person, retrieve my bag and make it safely back onto the Poroy-bound train. Easy, right? I was even more excited to learn that this is something completely unconventional which required supervisor approval and a bunch back and forth radio conversations which I could not translate for the life of me.As you can imagine I was a tiny bit nervous on the return train thinking about the five minute stop-over and the uncertainty that my bag was even there at the station. With it being pitch black outside I felt even more confident... Thankfully we had an AWESOME train crew who offered to make the right calls, confirm the pickup, successfully locate the bag, and bring it into our cabin. Nestor, Alan and Maritza were extremely helpful and made it a seamless experience.Aside from securing my bag they also went above and beyond in making the return trip a memorable one. What were just a standard food/beverage serving and clothing/gift sale on the first train turned into an all-out party on the return trip. Our train aisle became the center of fun with music, dancing, costumes and a fashion show. Sounds crazy, but this is exactly what it was. The staff made it a very enjoyable time as we cruised toward Poroy. I would highly recommend the vistadome on PeruRail if you decide to travel via rail. The staff made it a fantastic trip and saved my luggage from what could have been a completely failed rendezvous."

Day 3 October 2016 on the train from Ollantaytambo to Aguas Calientes 19hs wagon B seat 10, the stationmaster gave way to a locomotive while passengers were waiting in the narrow aisle between the first track and the second track where our train stood in blatant threat to our security as passengers. We were a group of passengers of about thirty people in my car and as many in the other. This happened to worse at night. When I saw that this Lord Chief was giving way to a locomotive danger to passengers, I said him to stop it, he said I was right, but did not stop the march of the locomotive that happened to feet from where we were standing. Claim to the Company number 5062 whitout response."

On my first trip, the young attendant checked to see that the toilet was clean before I could use it. I really appreciated this as the train was full. On our return trip I noticed that the train had to stop to allow another trains to pass in the opposite direction. During this time the staff treated us to a Peruvian cultural dance and fashion show. They were fabulous and made the journey memorable. Thank you Indira, Abel and Efrain. You are brilliant ambassadors of your company.

However the return journey the following day did not go well. We purchased two tickets for the return journey (at $US99 per ticket) that was to take me from Aguas Calientes to Poroy but due to strike action we were off boarded at Ollantaytambo. A refund of $9 was promised; that's a 10% refund for being taken for only 50% of the journey, but I would have to apply for that refund after the trip was complete and it would not be sent to me automatically I'm still waiting for the refund). We were offered no assistance at Ollantaytambo and were told it was our responsibility to find transport back to Cusco. I find both the value of the refund and the lack of assistance entirely unreasonable and unacceptable. It was not a good experience and I was extremely disappointed with the treatment we received. It spoilt what would otherwise have been a very good experience."

Additionally, this train was quite attractive inside, comfortable, and there was narration throughout the journey, in both Spanish and English, describing various sites along the way. The service was very friendly and efficient, and I was served a nice little lite meal on the longer trip which was 4 hours. Also, on that trip, the staff performed a \"fashion\" show for us modelling some beautiful clothing made of Peruvian alpaca. It was very entertaining and each piece was more beautiful than the last! I ended up buying a beautiful, knee length, reversible coat, for a great price and duty-free! I had seen a similar one in Lima for $600 USD. This one was $285. Sold!

Our ticket also included lunch in Machu Picchu which was well worth it.The only issue we had is there was a local transportation strike and we were in the middle of it. When we got off in Ollantaytambo- no one told us that we could not get transportation from there to Urabamba because of the strike- We finally found a taxis we was willing to \"Attempt\" taking us but at a very inflated price- On the short 30 minute trip we released why- with large stones and logs on the road."

On days like the last ones we traveled - a strike day - the team of VTD203 (Sep 13 2016) to go to Machupicchu and to come back on VTD302 (Sep 15 2016) made my day and the one of my guests. On both days I had birthdays and without any problem supervisor Giulissa and her team had birthday cakes and a song for them to celebrate. They are also always extremely helpful with carrying luggage etc. The three staff members on each of the train were very professional and it is a pleasure traveling with you."

On the trip from MP to Poroy, they had a fashion show, with various alpaca clothing. Also, music and antics from a costumed entertainer.

Edgar was SO nice and accommodating, he didnt make us wait and ensured we would have a seat in another car with space to fit. He was so genuine and helpful and really made us feel like we had the most personalized service and truly elevated my view of perurail. The nice view on the way over and comfort of the train ride was amazing as well, and the whole experience was definitely great"

Due to protests along the train line we were advised about a week before our trip that the Vistadome would not operate from Poroy station and would only be able to make the trip from Ollataytambo to Machu Pichu. While I understand the safety concerns of operating through a dangerous route what was underwhelming was the lack of support from Peru Rail in getting us from Cusco to Ollataytambo for this trip. It was simply left to us to figure out a private transport to arrive at the appropriate station.This ended up costing us around $100US to charter ourselves, we asked for suggestions of transport companies after it was clear Peru Rail was making no effort to take care of customers who had paid up front months in advance. Even then they simply said on 3 different occasions \"ask your hotel to figure it out\"Eventually we arrived safely no thanks to them and yes the train and service was beautiful however I couldn't get the sour taste out of my mouth from their nonchalant attitude to helping us have the best experience possible in our short stay in Peru. We clearly have very different bench marks of what appropriate customer service is."

After dinner was when the excitement started. One of the staff was dressed in a multicolored costume and an animal mask. We surmised in was some mix of Incan tradition and religious meaning. This was really entertaining. Following this floor show, there was a fashion show of alpaca goods modeled by the male and female conductor.

I learned that most cards nowadays are already preregistered with \"verified by visa\", and that Perurail experiences frequent website glitches. So if your card is being repeatedly denied, it's probably a website maintenance issue. There are basically 3 options to resolving this : 1) wait and keep trying 2) buy tickets through a travel agency and pay the commission 3) contact Perurail via phone and have them process the payment for you. I went with this third option and it entailed sending trip dates, copies of identifications of travelers, and copies of the visa you're using. Kind of a hassle but it takes care of things, especially if you're running short on time like I was! The vistadome was an incredible experience. The views were absolutely breathtaking, the staff incredibly friendly, and they even put on a little show on the way back to Poroy from MP. They provide snacks and drinks. I'd take the direct train from Poroy (Cusco) to MP, it was totally worth it and not too expensive (94 usd one way, 99 back)."

We were staying in Ollantaytambo (probably the wisest bet when visiting MP), and we took this train (Vistadome) up and the Inca Rail first class voyage for the trip back in the evening. This train was significantly better built and therefore more comfortable, with much less side-to-side sway than the Inca Rail train. We took the 8:53 AM train from Ollanta, which gave us plenty of time to visit MP. We already had breakfast at our hotel, but this service gave us a sandwich as well, plus a hot and cold beverage. Having the glass windows on top was a neat way to see some of the mountains and trees we were passing. The meal for the dinner service on the Inca Rail trip on the way back was skimpy, and we wished we had taken this train both ways (although the extra view from the ceiling windows in the evening is not needed since it's dark). The other reason I preferred this service is that getting the tickets was easier, since PeruRail has offices at the Lima and Cusco airports (and in Cusco), and their hours are much better. For reasons unclear to me, none of the trains to Aguas Calientes/MP takes luggage. So my advice would be to stay two nights in Ollantaytambo, and take the Vistadome up and down."

It's okay on the right side of the train but the view is not quite as good. The journey is about an hour and a half but passes relatively quickly, there are soft drinks served with a small snack (a lovely fresh small baguette). The sandwich on the way out was far nicer than the one on the return journey which was very bland and dry. The train is a fabulous experience as it winds it's way alongside the river at a very gentle pace until arriving at the station in Aguascalientes. The seats are very comfortable with large windows for good views but the train does not have an observation car. On the return journey we were treated to a small fashion show, featuring alpaca garments which are then for sale after the show.

The food service was just a simple turkey sandwich with either juice, soda, coffee, or tea. The train was not very impressive, as I've been on many trains in other countries. It has lot's of windows to see the outside views. The one tracking on parts of the route was annoying. They should have 2 tracks all the way through. But I guess, they don't want to interrupt mother nature's landscape. The train was clean, and well kept. Workers were nice and friendly. They could use new trains in the coming years though."

On the return trip from Aquas Calientes to Poroy the boarding process, in contrast to the experience in Poroy, was very disorganized.

We decided on the second and took the Vistadome in from Ollantaytambo. We were originally booked to leave from the Poroy train station but protests along the line made that portion of the trip impossible. The ride itself is interesting as you get to see some very beautiful passages and experience how the climate and surrounding habitat changes from the drier higher altitude terrain to that of a sub-tropical high rainforest. Worth the trip. Agree that it may be a bit high priced through."

Our only concern was that when we made the initial reservation for the trip on line, the way to buy the ticket is not understood clearly. We bought the tickets in reverse because the way it is formatted its not clearly understood. For example: if we are in Ollantaytampu we would buy for Machu Picchu. Then on the way back we would by for Ollantaytampu. That's not how it works you have to buy Ollantaytampu to go to go to Machu Picchu and to return from Machu Picchu you buy Machu Picchu bc that is where your are not where your going. Due to that misunderstanding we lost a day in Aguas Calientes bc the trains were full due to a work strike that would occur in 2 days. All trains were packed. We lost one day reservation in one hotel, we were stranded in Ollantaytampu we had to stay a night in a hotel, and another hotel did not want to reimbursed for that lost day. It was a domino effect.PeruRail charged us a fee for that mixed up to leave the next day bc they didn't have space on that day's trains. We didn't check Inca Trail (less fancy), which is their competitor, for availability of space. The money we lost in hotels would have been less then buying tickets on the Inca Trail one way.

At the same time, the website advertises \u201centertainment\u201d which consisted of staff walking up and down the aisle selling Vistadome products on the way there. On the return we were put in the awkward situation of a drawn out \u201cfashion show\u201d in which staff modeled clothing for sale. I found this insulting and certainly an example of false advertising. I would not chose this train again."

The boarding was very swift, the train left on time.Of course, the whole experience wasn't as enjoyable or luxurious as the one on the Belmond train. But he price wasn't the same, either. PeruRail was ten times cheaper.It was too crowded, all the cars were full.There was no place for hand luggage and the space between the seats and the table is almost inexistent, also not enough legroom.The food they served was just ok. The fact that was irritating was that, instead of providing some chargeable drink a service onboard (I would have liked a Pisco Sour or at least some water), all the attendants did was presenting and trying to sell to the passengers some local wool-made clothes. (I do understand that they try to encourage the local crafts, but still...They should have had one waiter selling drinks, at least some water...)"

Unfortunately we spent an EXTRA 3 hours (total of 6) moving very slowly forward, then coasting backwards, stopping for a period of time with workers running around outside in the dark, moving forward again, backing up... you get the picture. Peru Rail staff, while kind, were less than informative. No PA announcements about updates on the situation. Staff would tell one or 2 people in the car what they felt was happening then travelers would talk amongst themselves to try and figure out what was going on. Not very effective PR and it lead to increased anxiety for many passengers. My husband and I were some of the lucky ones in that we did not have firm plans after our return to the Poroy station. Others missed checking in to their hotel and prearranged evening plans. To their credit the staff spoke to each group and worked to contact hotels, friends or prearranged transportation to inform them of our extended delay. My husband and I kept focusing on the positive. We had had a great day exploring Machu Picchu. We had access to a clean bathroom. We had packed extra snacks. We had purchased 2 tablecloths which we used for pillows and blankets. We weren't in danger just very very very late. :) PeruRail offered to bus us to another station in Cuzco after we finally arrived at Poroy (then we would arrange for a taxi), but my husband and I opted to take a taxi directly from Poroy to our hotel in Cuzco to eliminate any more delay. No discounts or refunds were offered. I'm just so grateful that the breakdown happened AFTER we had enjoyed a fabulous day at Machu Picchu and not on the way there!"

And the bathroom is huge for public transport! On our incoming journey to Machu Picchu the only snack was a ham and cheese sandwich so us being vegetarians, we had nothing to eat. However, on the outgoing trip to Ollantaytambo, there was a delicious spinach, tomato and cheese sandwich which even my child devoured! On this trip, there was quite the show with someone dressed in typical cultural dress and there was music and dancing! Such joy! The attendants also modeled different articles of clothing they had on sale (100% alpaca). We enjoyed going through tunnels, seeing snow capped mountains, a pack of donkeys, amongst so much more! Definitely a great way to travel! You arrive feeling refreshed and ready for the journey ahead of you (Machu Picchu)!"

From Ollay to Machu, I was assigned to the back of the train, so I had an amazing view, but the sun was really harsh! From MP to Poroy, they gave everyone a slice of pizza, a cookie, apple sauce and berries and also put on a show! It was entertaining, but half of the train was trying to sleep so it only kept people awake.Overall, great experience, but be careful if you decide to book the Belmond Sanctuary Lodge Buffet with them. I was under the impression that when I got to Machu Picchu Station, I could eat at the Belmond Sanctuary Lodge, but the Belmond Sanctuary Lodge and the Belmond Sanctuary Lodge Buffet are in TWO DIFFERENT LOCATIONS. Belmond Sanctuary Lodge is located at Machu Picchu Train Station, Belmond Sanctuary Lodge Buffet is located AT Machu Picchu (outside of entrance, you have to take the bus there). The Buffet is only open from 11am-3pm, keep that in mind as I thought I booked it for Saturday, but arrived at 4pm and was required to use the voucher the following day."

We purchased our tickets on Vistadome from Ollantaytambo to Aguas Calientes online through the Perurail website and paid with PayPal \u2013 a very quick and easy process. Our tickets were USD65 per person which is quite expensive in comparison for what it is; basically a 90 minute train ride with a small snack and a drink included. (We received a very tiny vegetable salad \u2013 about half a cup size\u2013 a fruit and a juice). The nice big windows are great. The landscape was interesting, but if there was any other way to get to Machu Picchu, you wouldn\u2019t miss out. We were excitedly anticipating the fashion show and Andean dancers, but only realized afterwards that those only happen on the return trip from Machu Picchu and not on the trip TO Machu Picchu. If I knew that, I would have booked it the other way around (although, when I checked their website afterwards, it does state that in the small print at the bottom\u2026) The seats were spacious and comfortable and they\u2019re group together in fours (two groups of two people facing each other over a small table). We met a lovely and very interesting young Brazilian couple and we chatted all the way to Aguas Calientes! As we were staying two nights in Aguas Calientes, we needed to take luggage in excess of the allowed weight on the train, and it was very easy to get approval by Email prior to our trip. That said, no one checked or questioned our luggage\u2026 Announcements on the stations are only in Spanish (and not very audible) and there are no electronic arrival or departure boards, so we could not understand what was going on or where we had to go, but the staff were very friendly and helpful, so we just asked them and managed to get on the right train at the right time."

In June a group of friends and I went to Machu Picchu and we decided to go via PeruRail's VistaDome train. I purchased our train tickets (x4) for the VistaDome train about two months ahead of time online. I paid for the tickets and received a confirmation and also instructions for how to pick them up from one of PeruRail's official stands/locations. The tickets were each about $100 (one-way). You do not need any travel agency's help to reserve or to purchase these tickets. Super easy to accomplish. The train ride was very nice, scenic, and comfortable. That said, I do have a few comments/critiques:1) There is no vegetarian \"main\" snack option - only meat. Seems basic - why not have a vegetarian snack option available?2) If the person sitting behind you with their back to you just happens to lean back their seat all the way before you do, you will not be able to lean back your seat at all, and it will be stuck in a fully upright position.3) If you can reserve and pay for your PeruRail VistaDome train ticket all online...why cannot you just print up your actual ticket as well? Not having a printed up ticket, and having to find the PeruRail kiosk in the Lima airport in between connecting flights (or having to go early to the train station) was not a simple task, and considering everything else we had going on, it was one more thing to worry about doing. Make it so you can print you ticket out after paying for it online. Simple. 4) Offer passengers beer and wine immediately upon boarding...don't wait until there are 25 minutes left in the train ride to bring out the liquor cart and try to sell a few drinks! This one is elementary! We were so disappointed to see the cart come out when it did. (On our way back from Aguas Calientes we made sure to ask right away for the drink options...)Note - the Cusco train station (named: Poroy Station) is about a 30 minute cab ride from the central square area of Cusco. Make sure to give yourself enough time to make your train departure!"

The seating is comfortable and there is a WC at the end of the carriage. The staffing ratio to passengers is very good and the staff look very professional in their uniform. The journey is not cheap our seats cost $82 each for the journey to Aguas Caliente and $86 for the return. Costs vary depending on day and time of day. We were served a light meal on both legs of our journey and a drink. The staff did come round with souvenirs to buy on the outward journey and held a fashion show with Alpaca clothing, which was also for sale, on the return journey. There was also a dancer in each carriage on the return journey. This was lots of fun. The main highlight of the journey though was the scenery we passed through and the amazing views we had through the large picture windows both at the side and in the roof of the train. Passengers who were facing forwards seemed to have better views and found it easier to take photos of some of the scenery. Our return journey was only partly in daylight, because we just had a day trip to Machu Picchu. For anybody who stays longer try and book a train which travels in daylight hours, or perhaps save some money by booking the cheaper Expedition train if travelling in darkness. Be aware that some dates sell out quickly so you will need to book in advance. We did feel the train ride added to what was a very special day visiting Machu Picchu."

The sweaters were beautiful and the staff really did a great job. Be sure to buy then as we couldn't find the sweaters they wore in the stores when we got to Cusco. Overall, highly recommend"

For this portion they blared the music so loud I could hear it through headphones. I just wanted to relax and get some rest after Machu Picchu but I felt that I was disturbed the entire trip.I could not believe that we paid so much for this train that has the same seating type and leg room as the Expedition train. For 5 hours my knees were bumping against a complete stranger's. I surely thought for that much money we would have more comfortable accommodations. I even had an aisle seat but I could not stretch my legs because the staff were CONSTANTLY in the aisles trying to sell things. The snack was barely edible, and we left it largely uneaten. The air condition was so poorly managed that we couldn't see out the vistadome because the cabin temperature created so much fog on the windows. This is the whole point of Vistadome. Ultimately, I just wanted to relax on this 5 hour journey, and it was impossible for me to do so because of the awful seating conditions and constant interruptions and disturbances. What a terrible waste of money. I wish we had taken another train and then the combi back to Cusco. At least my knees would have been against a seat and not a stranger's, and it would have been much much faster."

Perurail's vistadome experience has been hyped so much on the web that we couldn't help but booking our onward journey (Ollantaytambo to Aguas Calientes) in Vistadome but, our return journey was in regular Expedition service. Both train services have the panoramic windows. So don't get carried away the only vistadome has it. Of course the vistadome windows were a little bit more luxurious, but the overall experience the same in both train services. Vista dome provides snacks (one croissant + one banana + coffee) in a glass plate and cup, whereas Expedition service provides a local biscuit and coffee in plastic cup. The seats are luxurious in both train services. All-in-all, if you are looking to spend more in insignificant luxury items, then opt for Vistadome, otherwise Expedition service is equally good and cheaper."

After staying in Cusco and then travelling to the Sacred Valley,( where we stayed one night near Ollantaytambo), we took the Vista train from the station at Ollantaytambo to Aguas Calientes (for Machu Picchu).Our return train was booked on our behalf by Condor Travel, who arranged the pick up to the station where we were met by a Condor Travel guide, who made sure that we had our tickets stamped - you have to arrive at the station at least half an hour before departure to get your tickets stamped. We met someone in Cusco who had arrived too late at the station and hadn't been able to board the train....It is a surprisingly well run operation, the train left on time, the seats are allocated for you, although we didn't get a choice - there was a clear boarding protocol, with the carriages being called individually, plenty of announcements, the staff were polite, spoke good English and were very smartly dressed (a little like airline crew). The train was clean and tidy, there are big windows to look out at the beautiful passing scenery and you get served a light snack (no choice) and drink. There is also on the two hour train journey the inevitable opportunity to buy scarves and gifts, although no pressure to buy.The train pulls into the station, where the hotel staff from our hotel met us and took our overnight bag - something we didn't realise is that you can only take an overnight bag (carry on suitcase / pack pack) on the train, there is no room for large luggage on the train, so we left our main luggage at the hotel where we stayed the previous night near Ollantaytambo and Condor travel arranged to collect it on our behalf and transfer it to our next hotel (after Machu Picchu) - it all worked very well. Our guide then met us at the station and took us immediately to Machu Picchu.We stayed the night at the Inkatera hotel right by the train station and then returned the next day on the Vista train, which returns to a station called Poroy (for Cusco), it was a 15 minute taxi transfer to get to our hotel in the centre of Cusco - the train back takes much longer, three and a half hours, it's a slow pace of travel, there is the inevitable opportunity to buy more woollen jumpers and capes on the way back when you are entertained by a 'fashion show' - there was a complimentary light snack and drinks served.It's worth factoring the three and a half hour return journey into your day, our train left at 5.00 pm, so by the time we arrived in Cusco, checked into our hotel, it was later in the evening before we had chance to get dinner."

Buying tickets on the web from overseas is relatively simple but then they require a personal pickup of the train tickets at their Rail office - unless you are wandering all over town in Lima, not the easiest place to get to, but if you are flying into Cusco, don't forget to pick it up at the airport near the baggage carousel - else, find the office at the main square in Cusco - bottom line, one more item to do administratively.The train is comfortable, either 4 seats around a table or 2 seater. The scenery is beautiful on the way out from Poroy to Agua Calientes. Cost about 40 soles to catch a cab from Cusco to Poroy - and might as well arrange with the same cab to pick you up on the way back if you are coming back that evening. The train heater system is wonky - seems like they turn it on till gets warm, then turn it off till it gets cold, and repeat... nothing in between.... and sitting in the first carriage behind the engine, the ac sucked some of the diesel smoke into the cabin - we could smell the smoke. We left early in the morning, so the windows outside were cold, and with the heat blasting in the cabin, the windows fogged up quickly - we had to clean it often to see outside, but the windows seem to be dusty as the cleaning seems to smudge the window, making taking photos thru the windows a chore.The trains are on narrow tracks so the swaying is more pronounced than on the wider tracked trains. Loud but not too noisy, we can hear the train clacking away. Service was good - we were served food and drinks, and on the way back, the crew put on a mini fashion show to sell their alpaca sweaters, etc.It is a long journey to AC, mainly because the train travels at a moderate speed. The other option is to go from Ollantaytambo but that meant an over 1 hr taxi ride from Cusco to Ollantaytambo - it is either a combination of a longer train ride + shorter taxi ride to Poroy (<30 mins) vs a shorter train ride + longer taxi ride to Ollantaytambo (>1 hr) ... cost aside, given the road conditions, probably the shorter the car ride the better, I suppose."

Assuming the weather is good and there isn't too much condensation on the train windows, it's great for taking pictures. It is important to note that this train is expensive and relatively slow, but the point is to see the sights and to learn about them, not to get to your destination as quickly as possible. The announcements in English and Spanish explain the significance of the towns and other locations as you pass through them, which makes the journey even more interesting. On our trip, the employees in our car, Zelena, Marco Antonio, and Saul, were especially helpful. They were friendly and happy to answer our questions. Zelena seemed very informed and gave us a lot of suggestions on hiking Machu Picchu and on tourism in Peru in general. I would highly recommend Vistadome.

It's a relatively long train ride from Cusco to Agua Calientes (for Machu Picchu) and the Vistadome train enables one to make the most of it with wonderful views - the river on one side and mountain range on the other. Both sides offer great views and it really is personal taste as to whether one side is better than the other.From our experience we observe two important aspects. The early morning cold air can leave the windows misted and therefore obscure the view - those in the know brought a towel to wipe the windows. Our seats were booked by our agent so I don't know whether one has any say on the seats allocated but both times we were seated at the first table in the carriage so could not really get a glimpse of what was to come which made it difficult to prepare for any specific photo opportunities. A seat towards the middle of the carriage might be better for that. There still seems to be a great deal of doubt over what one can take on board in the way of luggage with the expectation being one small bag or rucksack each. There is a small space for large luggage at the end of the carriage so assuming only a few people bring something larger it can be accommodated. I have a small rucksack for camera equipment so took that plus a small rucksack with my overnight stuff. There was no problem taking those two items on board. Such baggage can fit between the seats or under one's seat.Service was great and the fashion show fun too. So not just the best way to get where one is going but a great experience too."

The attendants were very attentive and brought us very tasty food to drink. On the way back from 2 days at Machu Picchu we opted to take the Expedition class car vs the Vistadome. It was interesting because the Expedition car itself had the same 'vista' windows as the Vistadome. The difference was in the decor - with the Expedition being a more basic version vs the Vistadome had been a more upscale decor. The other difference was the service or, in particular the food offerings. On the Expedition they brought the standard cracker/carb option prepackaged items, whereas on the Vistadome it was not packaged items, but plated. We were tired on the way back, and had a lovely time visiting with a couple from England, so the differences weren't that big a deal to us, but if that kind of thing is important to you, this may give you an idea of the difference between Vistadome and Expedition."

            "review": "Great views of Sacred Valley on the way to Machu Picchu. I had a misconception that you could take the train all the way to Machu Picchu. That is not true. The train takes you to the town of Aguas Calientes which is in the valley below Machu Picchu. Then you take a bus from Aguas Calientes to get to Machu Picchu. The buses run every 10 minutes during operating hours, and the trip to/from Machu Picchu takes about 23 minutes on the switchbacks up and down the mountain.There are several classes of train service, each a little nicer and more expensive. You can take a local train, the Expedition train (akin to second class), the Vistadome train (akin to first class), or the Hiram Bingham train (luxury train, runs on a limited schedule). My wife and I took the Vistadome train from the Ollantaytambo station to Aguas Calientes, and back (several days later).Our travel agent in the US arranged for tickets with pre-reserved seats. If you can, sit in the \"A\" car, because you have unobstructed views in the direction of the train. You can see out the sides and top of each car. There are some magnificent views in the Sacred Valley! We were served a snack on each trip. Some tour groups pre-arranged for special snacks. On our return trip, we were treated to a mini-fashion show and some costumed entertainers. Plan to arrive 30 minutes before your train is scheduled to leave. You can start boarding 10-15 minutes in advance. When you leave Machu Picchu, our travel agent told us to allow about 1.5 hours to get from Machu Picchu to the train station at Aguas Calientes. That gives you plenty of time in case of minor, unforeseen delays. It is possible to change your train tickets to a different time, if there are still available seats (or you can take the local train or the Expedition train, which have no pre-reserved seats).PeruRail personnel take care of your big luggage pieces on each train. You give the luggage to them outside your train car, and they take care of loading and securing the luggage on the train. When you arrive, they take the bags off, and you pick them up on the platform outside the train car. (Be sure to tip for their helpful service!). There are places behind the seats where you can stow your smaller bags. There are generally tables on each side of the train, with 4 passengers at a table, 2 facing forwards, and 2 facing backwards. At the very front of the train car, there is a space for just 2 passengers. There are restrooms at one end of each train car. The Vistadome train is a pleasant and relaxing way to get transported to the special place known as Machu Picchu."

It was about an hour and a half and included a snack and a drink. We had a front-row view of the mountains, streams and local villages, and it was gorgeous! Despite what other people told us, they had plenty of room for our suitcases (we each had a purse, a carry-on and a large suitcase). So that shouldn't be a problem.On the train back from AC to Cusco, which is about 4 hours, they fed us again, allowed us to open our own bottle of wine, and they even held a fashion show that lasted about 15-20 minutes! The staff were very sassy and they showed off some beautiful alpaca sweaters and coats. While I didn't buy them, it was actually a ton of fun, we all laughed and applauded, and it helped pass the time! The only small annoyance is how slow the train goes (about 20mph) - while it's great for scenic viewing, if you're looking to save time and get from point A to point B quickly, you might want to find a different mode of transportation."

We purchased the tickets online on April 4th. The online ticket purchase was painless. Only thing is that they automatically assign seats. We were assigned seats A1 and A2 and I was very excited based on other tripadvisor reviews (alas!). A taxi picked us up from our hotel on Av El Sole at 7:30AM and we reached the Poroy station at 7:53am. Pory is about 8 miles from Ave El Sole in historic Cusco. The taxi fare was 35 Soles. There was already a line to enter the platform when we reached the Poroy station. After entering the platform, the attendants guided us to our compartment A, which was the first compartment after the engine. The attendants checked our passports and tickets. They also loaded our luggage at this time and put it on the luggage racks. Here is an interesting variation from what I was expecting. Based on Tripadvisor reviews of Vistadome, I was expecting to sit at the front of the train next to the driver. Our seats numbers were A1 and A2. Other tripadvisor reviewers mentioned that seats A1 and A2 are the best. But for our trains (both outbound and inbound) the seats are not so great. The trains have engines in front of them and seats A1 and A2 are at the back of the compartment with walls limiting visibility. By the way, I did see trains passing us where the seats A1 and A2 are next to the drivers (engine numbers 222, 221). I am not sure which trains are those. Anyway, the view from the trains are spectacular! The best seats would be in the middle of the compartment, on the left side outbound and on the right side inbound. They do provide \"snacks\" within the first hour of the journey. And it is \"Snacks\", as mentioned in Peru Rail website. They did not say it is lunch or dinner and please do not complain that it is not a big meal. The train reached Machu Picchu station at 12:25PM. Our inbound train was at 3:20PM in the afternoon and our seat numbers were 17 ann 18. These seats are in better positions, but you face the back of the train. It got dark within two hours but you still see a lot."

The bathroom is adequate, but rather barebones. The one suggestion I have is not to take the last train leaving from Aquas Calientas because it gets dark rather early and you would miss the gorgeous views. I would also try to sit on the right side of the train on the way to Cusco for the best views of the river and the surrounding mountains."

There is commentary on the way - in Spanish and English - and you are served a snack and drink. Don't get your hopes up about the snack - we had very dry cake on the way there! The staff are very organised, friendly and professional which made the train trip particularly pleasant. On our return to Cusco, we had Mario, Rosa and Deaner serving in our carriage. They put on an Andean show and a fashion show. Obviously it was quite commercialised, selling us some nice alpaca items but they really got into the spirit of it and it made for a fun and entertaining ride back after our big day on the mountain.

This is a tourist route for sure but for those of us less adventurous, or who have a time constraint it is a good way to journey up there from Ollantaytambo. It isn't cheap either but what does one expect when there are not going to be multiple train lines to the top? You need to make reservations since you get assigned seating and can't just show up on the day - I guess you could if you wanted to risk it but again, if you are on a schedule you can't do so and be certain to get up and back expeditiously.The trains are comfortable and the views up spectacular as the scenery and vegetation changes on the way to the site. They serve a snack and drink on the way up and back that is included in the ticket price and there is a short fashion show on the way back encouraging you to buy Peruvian items (and we did - tourists that we are).The journey out is easier, but go early as it is busy. On the return the train was much longer and the station is chaotic. It all works fine just don't freak out if you find yourself in a hugely crowded departure area waiting for the train to board. It works efficiently once they get the doors open and you follow your steward with a coach sign (we were in coach E for example). Again, it's Machu Picchu so it's going to be crowded, right? The return journey was much longer at nearly 2 hours. A good way to get there in my opinion."

There is an alternative if you're stranded in the expensive AC city via Santa Teresa FYI. Now concerning Peru Rail proper I found it to be the better choice even if it was more expensive that the IRail counterpart. First of all the staff was much more welcoming. Inside the train the feel was more quaint. Snack wise I Rail was definitely better (as here it was bigger but not as good in quality). But what really did it for us was the show they have in PeruRail that involves Andean dancing and Andean music.All in all: don't get your hopes up, both train lines are overpriced and a tourist trap.

The Vistadome cost more and was much less comfortable. The seat was not as comfortable as the seat on the Expedition. There is a table that separates the passengers and it limits your ability to move. The Expedition was much more roomy! Save your money! They both have windows that allow you to view from the roof, so don't be sold that visibility is better on the Vistadome!"

If trekking is not a possibility for you, then the next best thing is this train. You get to lay back and enjoy the landscape with Andean music on the background. The meal offered is rather simple, but we were offered as much coffee/tea/soda as we wanted. Staff was friendly and they all spoke English.At certain locations throughout the journey, a recording provides information on the types of vegetation or animals you can expect to see. On our trip we got to see orchids, yet this depends on the season.A bit of advice: I would not recommend this ride after sunset. It is expensive, and worth every penny when you are able to see the landscape, yet after sunset everything is pitch black out there and you can't see a thing, so keep that in mind when booking."

My advice is if your booking the train don't go for the Belmond buffet option as my partner and my self did not think it was worth it, the food was average and for 30 dollars each we would have preferred to eat at the restaurant at Machu Pichu as it offers food and drinks with amazing views. Train definitely worth it but the added buffet option not. The views of the train is just amazing."

The staff (Mary Carmen, Bernardo & Rony) were very attentive and were extra accommodating to our 2 kids. They gave our 4-year-old son a huge lollipop when we got onboard, then another one about halfway through. They also loved playing with our 4-month-old daughter, which was very sweet! Seats are assigned, but the staff helps people sit in the seats with the best views if they are open. The views are truly spectacular and you would miss a lot of incredible mountaintop views without the roof windows. The snack was lovely: slice of prickly pear, sweet banana, nuts & and a large cornbread - everything was served on beautifully woven Peruvian placemats. They provided complimentary drinks throughout the ride. The only negative was that there was really no room with the diaper bag, purse, husband's backpack & son's backpack. There's a storage area for large bags, but we wanted to keep those items to hand. Luckily, the 4th seat in our section remained open so we used that and under the table, but we were still a little crowded. Everything was well-run & spotless - even the restroom was the cleanest I've seen on a train! All-in-all, a fabulous experience."

This turned into a nightmare with the driver taking us into town and making us change cars and drivers. We have both traveled extensively and found this a bit scary.

We left Machu Picchu in the late afternoon and we arrived outside of Cusco at a small town and station since the train doesn't go all the way and our arranged driver didn't show up to pick us up. We didn't know what do to. A Peru Rail supervisor saw we were the only ones left in the parking lot (and it was dark) so he asked us who he could calls for us. He made a number of calls for us and found out that our driver wasn't coming for some reason. So he helped us and came with us on their Peru Rail bus that he had wait for us -- and he made sure we got a ride from the next station. His name Carlos Ruben and we went beyond the call of duty to save us from being lost in the middle of nowhere. An amazing rail company to say the least! Plus we loved to food service on the train. Unlike some countries, Peru has 3-4 different train companies to choose from."

Then FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS on the confirmation about picking up your ticket. In Ollantaytambo, make your way thru the sea of vendors to the ticket-takers. Then there is a decent little waiting area with large, clean bathrooms and a small snack bar. The train was about 3 or 4 cars long, with first class being up front. I'm not sure that all the cars had the same service or large windows. The seats are set up so that you share a table with two other passengers so two of you are facing forward and two are facing backward. It was almost humorous that there were nicely dressed attendants on such a tiny train, but they wheeled the cart down the aisle, giving us a complementary drink and snack. Then they came back with a \"duty free\" type cart, selling alpaca shawls, hats, etc! There is also a tiny bathroom in the car, where they ask (as in most of Peru) that you throw your soiled toilet paper in the trashcan. The views are nice, but not spectacular."

The snacks are meager and they don't even give you a full mug of tea. Plus they try sell you books and t-shirts at inflated prices on the way there and on the way back there is a fashion show- which is quite fun but then they really try push you to buy the knitwear (the same brand is located off the Plaza del Armas in Cusco- they have a sale on at the moment too). Apart from the hard sell the staff are very nice though but overall we came away feeling a bit \"meh\" about the whole experience.

This train, as the name implies, has windows in the ceiling to allow for a more expansive viewing. The train takes about 1.5 hours from pichay however the time flies. The views are spectacular, and the service was excellent, which includes a light meal service and soft drinks (beer, wine extra).There is only one track so the trains coming and going need to coordinate, which means that the trains need to stop at times to let one another pass by. We were surprised when the announcement came that the train stewards were going to put on a fashion show! They were selling Sol Alpaca (which you can buy anywhere, including the airport), however they played Peruvian music, and the stewards tried their best at waking the catwalks in their alpaca sweaters, scarves etc. Well it worked, and we ended up buying a scarf and sweater."

I have visited more then 15 countries around the world, and defiantly Machu Picchu is a very different from all the places I have been to.Why did I give 2 stars and why do I say The Monopoly of Machu Picchu. My wife and I took the PeruRail from Ollantaytambo to Aguas Caliente. (The service from Felipe and Elizabet in the train was great and they were very sweet and helpful ), but PeruRail is the ONLY company that will take passengers from and to Machu Picchu. PeruRail is not owned by the government and they can charge as much as they want. If your from Peru you will pay more then 50% less then a tourist . This trip was very expansive for me and my wife because of PeruRail. I spoke with a lot of local people in Ollataytambo and they fell the same way.If you have time please take different ways to Machu Picchu. Machu Picchu biggest and only revenue is tourist . Why do they have to over charge us tourist a ridiculous amount to ride a very short train ride.Ways to get to Machu Picchu. You could take the Over PRICE PeruRail or you could hike. First Cuzco to Santa Maria, Santa Maria to the Hydroelectric Plant of Santa Teresa, then you hike from Hydroelectric Plant to Aguas Calientes about 3.5 hrs hike. I hope this help"

On the way back the shuttle broke down but they were quick to provide another shuttle to transport us back to our starting destination. The shuttle was a bit smaller so most of the employees riding with us stayed back allowing the passengers to return to our destination in time to connect with taxis."

The front carriage had the compartment for the train driver and right beside this compartment were seats 1 and 2 with a picture window showing the same view that the driver was seeing. We got seats 1 and 2. Why? I have no idea. I don't know if our agent requested these seats, if we paid for these seats or if we were just really lucky. Whatever the reason, if you can get these seats then take them. They are fantastic. There is no better view of the journey than from these seats.On our way back we had regular seats. From the open ceiling, the views of the Andes are good and worth the cost of the tickets (versus the cost of the regular train). What made the trip back so special was that we were sat beside a couple we had met briefly while at Machu Picchu. They made the trip down particularly enjoyable.What I will say is that the train is not convenient for Cusco. On our way to Aguas Client we took a tour through the Sacred Valley so didn't realize how far from Cusco we had come. On the way back, it was a 2 1/2 hour car ride from the train station to our hotel in Cusco."

There is also the Hiram Bingham train which is way more expensive and there is a one level down called the Expedition. I spoke to someone who took the Hiram Bingham last year and she suggested that the Vistadome would be a great alternative if you did not want to pay the significant difference in price. Once you finalized your purchase online, you still need to pick up the actual tickets upon arrival in Peru. They sent us an email with confirmation booking number and list of places where we can pick up the actual train tickets from. If you plan to fly into Cusco airport, there is a Peru Rail counter next to the baggage collection on the lower floor. Bring a copy of your confirmation number and show them your passport as identification. You will then get prints of your tickets with bar-codes on it. We spotted another Peru Rail counter in Miraflores, Lima in Larcormar Shopping near the JW Marriot and I believe there is one in Lima Airport and downtown Cusco.Peru Rail also suspended partial of our journey from Cusco (Poroy station) to Pachar (near Ollantaytambo) due to the rainy season. They provided shuttle buses from and to Pachar from Poroy. Once you get to Poroy, then you hop on the train to Ollantaytambo and Aguas Calientes (Machu Picchu). Make sure to check the schedule during the rainy season. Bear in mind that if you stay in Cusco, you need to take a cab to Poroy which is about 15 minutes outside of Cusco. You can also take a cab from your hotel to Pachar which is about 1.5 scenic drive. We decided to abandon the free shuttle and took a private car and paid 35 USD each way.The train journey from Pachar to Machu Picchu and back was just absolutely breathtaking. The railroad track runs along the Urubamba river and the sacred valley. Vistadome's multiple skylights on each car allow all passengers to admire the beautiful scenery along the way. They also serve snacks, cookies, selection of drinks and a bag of inca corn. The bathroom on the train is clean and quiet spacious. You can just relax and enjoy the view. They make announcement every so often about the history of the surrounding valleys as well as several notable spots where you can see some Inca terraces along the trip. Yes, you can see them prior on the side of the river given the daylight. if your schedule is flexible, make sure to be on the train during the day. On our return journey from Aguas Calientes, Peru Rail orchestrated a fashion show on the train; featuring Alpaca products. The scarves, coats and other accesories are being modeled by the attendance of the train. It was really fun and some of the merchandise was exclusively made for Peru Rail. We thought it was a nice entertainment for everybody. They also did a one-man folk-local dance prior to the fashion show wearing indigenous costumes ans mask."

The trains were on time, clean, had friendly staff and good food and drinks. The views, of course, were spectacular. I had expected great views of the mountains, forests and valley - but the roaring Urubamba river (it was the wet season) was spellbinding. All in all, the experience was as smooth as any in Peru. There were some minor glitches, like with the credit card machine at the train station (phone lines were down for an hour.) On the outgoing trip, I thought the crew was a little too persistent trying to move the overpriced items on the souvenir cart. But, on the return trip, I really enjoyed the fashion show / Andean dance put on by the crew. Jenkins was outstanding in his role as the Saqra dancer. After the crowds got off at Ollantaytambo, we had a really nice chat with our steward, Bernardo. Vistadome is very lucky to have such a charming employee."

We had bought our tickets months in advance, so we were issued bus tickets from Poroy to Pachar (what they refer to as bimodal). We decided to take a taxi van from our hotel (JW Marriott in Cusco) both ways. It was quicker but obviously cost more. Our driver stopped along the way and acted as a tour guide...a nice aside!Another option...You might want to consider buying your train ticket from Ollyantatambo r/t and taking a taxi to and from Cusco if you are staying there."

The interiors are comfortable with small tables in front of generously sized seats but the major attraction is in the large side and ceiling windows. The tracks follow the river so being able to look out, and up, allows you to take in the massive mountains towering above. Glimpses of ruins, the raging river, fields of gladiolas and farms dot the route.Beverages and snacks are offered during the trip as are souvenirs and guide books. VistaDome cars have a luggage rack at each end and a lavatory where you can hone your balance while rocking to the rhythm of the rails. Your VistaDome seat will whet your appetite for what lies ahead in Macchu Picchu."

No one seemed concerned about fixing the problem. I think I figured out why there were so many smear marks on the windows - previous riders had most likely tried to de-fog the windows. Also, we took the train at the end of the day and it got dark. It's not worth spending the extra money for the night time leg of the trip.If you take this train, do so in the morning."

The scenery between Ollanta and Aguas Calientes is spectacular with several Inca ruins visible from the train. We also took the train back to Ollanta and on the return ride the staff put on a fashion show of Peruvian garments. While it was blatant sales to a captive audience, it was fun (and the quality of the merchandise was excellent). Altogether an enjoyable experience."

Not very spacious.Food was mediocre, basically snacks--- consisted of nuts, corn cake, small banana, and small quinoa cookie with chocolate drizzle, and a drink of your choice. It's basically similar to airline food.They try to sell you stuff on the train.Music was good... Traditional Peruvian, relaxing, kinda puts you to sleep.We took the vistadome from ollataytambo to agua calientes, and the expedition back. Both were comparable, not much of a difference. The views are the same from both (expedition also has large side and top windows). Wasn't worth the extra money for the vistadome.... Would recommend saving your money and just taking the expedition."

For the first hour the train is just for hotel guests before picking up other passengers almost halfway to Machu Picchu. The Vistadome cars are very nice with plenty of window space to see. A tea/coffee service is provided for the first hour, and then once the other passengers board there is a further service including a snack. The seats are typically a 4 set around a table facing the others opposite, but seats 1 and 2 are the best at the very front of the train with stunning views. The trip is very relaxing and the staff was great on the way there and on the way back. On the return trip the staff do a little fashion show selling some local items done by PeruRail with Roxanna, Juan Manuel, and Fredy doing an amazing job. Great trip and would highly recommend the train and the hotel. The last hour of the train trip back I had the entire car to myself for the sunset return."

Since the part of rail is under construction, the train station in Cusco was temporaly closed. To take the train to Machu Pichhu, we had to take taxi and one our drive from Cusco to the nearest available train station. That was maybe only minus, because this company doesn't provide any transportation from Cusco. Everything else was perfect. Upon reaching the station in Pachar, staff took our heavy lagguages and assisted us with boarding. Staff speak English and are very kind and pleasant.Enterior of the train is cosy and nice with glass roof, so passengers can enjoy amazing scenary.The tables are for four people, so you can not enjoy privacy. Snacks and hot and cold beverages are served onboard, too.Strongly recommended since we tried on return other company. These one was much better."

The staff (Elma, Ronal and Fredy) were super friendly and provided great service and entertainment, including a fun little fashion show of Sol Alpaca products (available for purchase at great prices afterwards) and a cultural show (consisting of a slightly zany, dancing dog-faced devil of some sort that scared the bejeezus out of a Chinese lady, and totally made my day).If you're considering the Hiram Bingham, I'd say it is definitely worth doing it one-way (while expensive, it does include transportation, brunch, a guided tour of Machu Picchu and an excellent afternoon tea (with lots of food--not just typical tea fare)), but take the Vistadome on the way back. It's a LOT less expensive than the Hiram Bingham, and overall a more fun ride, and the views from the large Vistadome windows are fantastic too."

PeruRail provides a good quality train, but way too overpriced. Expect to pay the same in an air ticket, but receive a service below European train standards. If you are on a budget, research InkaRail and other options. Only go with PeruRail if you can afford wasting USD 160+ on a roundtrip."

The service is terrific\u2014we had Renzo, Indira, and Jose Luis, a charming trio. It's easy to pass right through Ollantaytambo to get to the station, with the anticipation of Machu Picchu foremost in mind, but I recommend against it. Ollantaytambo's Inka ruins are magnificent, and visiting them provides a sense of the Inka Empire's political and economic structure and strategy, fleshing out the Machu Picchu and Sacred Valley experience. Also, there are great restaurants and inns in town, with Inka structures and foundations of the usual fantastic craftsmanship scattered among them."

But travelling with my wife and 3 teenage daughters to hike and then overnight there meant a lot of consternation about the published \"1 bag only, max 5kg\" restriction.The 5kg limit is rubbish, and was totally ignored by the staff and other passengers. The 1 bag rule though was rightfully generally followed, as there is no baggage car, no overhead storage because of the overhead vista windows, and only limited storage at the end of each car and between some seats. Everyone can readily take up to 1 conventional airline carry-on backpack/roll-aboard/wheelie, and throw the weight limit away!! Just put hiking gear and overnight clothes and personal affects in one carry-on.FYI - there is nowhere to really put another small personal bag, except in one's lap or at one's feet.The service and overall condition of the Vistadome was Very Good. The views out the windows where amazing. Only other issue we had was the staff not being able to balance coming out of Poroy station early in the morning in a cold train the level of warmth with accompanying fogged up windows, versus very cold air and a cleared up view. All balanced once past Ollantaytambo, when the serious views begin."

Ollantaytambo to Aguas Calientes is not too bad, but Aguas Calientes to Cusco makes for a very long ride on this train.The issues with comfort are:1. The back-to-back seats are not recline limited, so some seats recline, while others don't at all. 2. Very limited legroom3. Very limited under-seat space for luggage (no overhead racks, since that's where the Vistadome windows go)4. Limited luggage rack space. Although you are supposed to take only a small backpack, some inconsiderate tourists bring along large, heavy bags which promptly fill the luggage racks.All in all, not too bad if you come with the right attitude, don't schlep along more than a small backpack, and don't need to share your leg space with a long-legged fellow traveler."

The train is very comfortable and the views amazing. On the way back from Machu Picchu the train stopped over an hour and a half outside of Cusco and we took a bus the rest of the way. From what I have read, they do this every year from January 1st through the rainy season. They did email me several weeks before the trip to let me know this was going to happen. My only issue is, if this happens every year, please let people know before booking. In our case, it would have changed our plans as it is very easy to just stay in Ollantaytambo and then use a tour company to transport you back and forth to Cusco and see the sights along the way. Overall good and friendly service but a little more info before booking would be helpful."

I had the same problem with the online booking, I didn`t get the tickets but the money was charged to my credit card. Same story than 6 years ago.What is good:The views are amazing. ScheduleThe train is in a good shape, was on time and boarding is well organized.What needs to improve:Food was much better 6 years ago. I knew is a snack, but this time food wasn\u00b4t bad, was horrible. I understand they want to serve typical food, but it has to be well prepared. Actually, we talked with a person from Peru and we told him about the food that we received in the train, and he said it was not a typical dish. Anyway, it was horrible. I would have preferred a potato chips bag or a sandwich. Very, very, very bad. And we saw lots of people not eating that.Another thing to improve is the air conditioning. It was not set up in a temperature, people said was cold, so they turn on heat, then, they move it to 23C. Didn't feel comfortable.They sale shirts and books and alpaca things but they all very pricey. In our way to Cusco, there is like a fashion show held by the \"crew\" of the train, which we disagree with because they are not models and you can see they didn\u00b4t feel good doing that. One of the men had to wear a woman dress and a mask! that was pathetic. Another suggestion is to have the chance to choose the chairs, because, to us was very uncomfortable to travel in the direction opposite the train, but there was nothing to do because the train was full. Also, on our way back, we had seats in a place of two instead of four which was much better."

One way is the tourist ticket as well as the train ticket there and back. If you wish to get there without the train is via the Inca trail that limits the number of people to 200. Hence the train is a monopoly controlled by the government. Paid $170 from Ollantaytambo to Machu Picchu's last stop for the return journey. The locals have to sit in another carriage and the tourist pay the high fares to get a free cup of soft drink and cushioned seats with heating. Though the train ride is certainly good (sit at the left of the train and book the front facing seats) , I don't particular enjoy the high fares."

Very entertaining ride, the 3 hours went by quickly. Loved the detail on the ride back, the waiters found out it was my birthday and out of a sudden birthday music was playing and I was invited a Cusque\u00f1a beer and apple pie! Very nice detail, unforgettable day with lots of love and charisma. Giulianne, Alejandro & Kevin are very attentive and caring."

And we were met with incredibly friendly people. Milagros and Glen were friendly and even gave us a fashion show. Jonathan S. gave us great performance. I have never seen anything like that on the train! On top of it, train was very clean and comfortable. And I was surrounded by good people and my friends. I enjoyed the ride to the full.

It was a very long ride but we were able to see such beautiful scenery that we really didn't mind. The snack service was unexpectedly great and the staff was very friendly. The return, however, was not so pleasant. About an hour and a half out there was a landslide that covered the tracks and we were informed there were several others after it so we would be having to wait for a bus to pick us up and take us back to Cuzco. As you can imagine, everyone on that last train is absolutely exhausted. We sucked it up because it was the safest option. The buses took about an hour and a half to arrive and the staff tried their best to entertain everyone while we waited. Once we were loaded onto a very tightly packed bus we made the drive back to Cuzco. It was the most HORRID bus ride of my life. Buses pass each other on very thin roads with zero regard for passenger safety. The bus ahead of us, which was part of our convoy, got into a collision because the driver miscalculated his timing in passing someone. There is absolutely no way anyone can get rest on that bus because it's not only so bumpy, but it's downright scary to shut your eyes. We arrived in Cuzco 3 hours after our scheduled time and the staff did nothing to compensate for the nightmare. The people waiting for passengers in Poroy were informed the buses would be arriving in Cuzco but somehow our driver missed the memo and we were left having to take a taxi. One of the train attendants was nice enough to help us get a safe taxi and even rode with us to ensure we would get to our hotel safely but PeruRail did nothing to apologize or compensate for the horrific ride. I get that landslides are out of their control but they should work on getting safer transportation for those occasions. It is unacceptable to me that the bus ride was so unsafe and scary after such an exhausting day."

You are provided with a couple of snacks, coffee, soda, or coca tea. I do recommend you eat well before the train. Keep your camera ready as you don't know when you will have a amazing landscape.

The only problem is fog covers them sometimes, so you have to ask people to open all the little windows.I didn't like how they didn't get my attention to ask me if everything was okay, or if I needed anything... but when it comes to donations, they asked me twice! Even though I was obviously not looking at them.I think it's impolite to ask for donations when we're just having fun. And even if they do, they should go to the people that call them, not asking every single person in the train. That was very annoying, specially because in front of us, there were these 2 foreigner that bought some expensive scarves on the train, and they \"acted\" like they were sleeping when they started talking about donations.I donate to the people that need it, not to the companies, because I know how's the deal.Also, I have to complain about the breakfast because I saw every single foreigner didn't like the corn cake that peruvian people usually like. I think they should give something that most people like.And I have to say that the lady in the trip going back to Cusco was very nice and gave us more coca tea because we were feeling sick. And told us to move to other seat if we wanted because people were going to leave the train.We got the seat facing the back (both trips), you miss a lot of things and can make you sick. Sadly, this is randomized when you buy the ticket."

The Visadome car's ceiling is not totally clear as I expected and the Tourist car actually does have some clear panels in the ceiling.Seating was such that most seats are divided into pods of four with two seats facing each other per side and a table in the center. It would have been nice to be able to decide if this is where we want to be seated. An older gentleman sitting across from us decided he could not sit without extending his legs straight....almost underneath his compartment mates seat. I felt bad for the young fellow in that seat.

It can get a little tricky knowing when to line up and exactly what train to get on, unless you are aware the each train has a name - and that name corresponds to announcements made about it. Since there are so many trains going to the same location, the naming convention really works, but you have to look at your ticket carefully to know, and the follow signs and announcements accordingly."

PeruRail's Vistadome train offers probably the most pleasant option. Seating is a little cramped for a person of my size (tall and wide) but it is reasonably comfortable. We joined the train at Urubamba on the way to Macchu Picchu and, on the return journey got off at Ollantaytambo. In following the path of a river, the train passes through some spectacular country and views of the Andean peaks are facilitated by the 'vistadome' windows. If lucky, the traveller may see an Andean condor riding the mountain thermals. The train service provides basic light refreshments as part of the ticket cost and, airline style, sets up a trolley with local goods to sell to interested passengers."

We took the Vistadome between Cusco (Poroy station) and Aguas Calientes (base town for Machu Picchu). The Peru countryside is beautiful, and we appreciate a few pointers from the train staff about major stops and the history of certain locations. The seating could use some improvement though. Most of the seats are four to a table (two facing the other two) so there is really no room to stretch your legs while seated without kicking the person in front of you. Legs do get cramped after a few hours. This could be remedied by making the seats all front facing and using table trays just like on a plane (at least you can stretch your legs without kicking somebody). The snack is decent (at least it includes vegetarian options) and the staff courteous. As others have mentioned, the ride back to Cusco included a costumed show, which was to promote/sell their products. This ride would be worth it if the seating wasn't so uncomfortable, and for that, I have to give it a lower rating than I would have."

Earlier this month we took a most enjoyable round trip, from Cusco to Machu Picchu, on the unique Vistadome train. The view of the villages, mountains, vegetation and rivers along the way, which were so perfectly seen through the mostly glassed walls and roof of the train cars, is magical. We also enjoyed tremendously the spacious seats the thorough overheard explanations, the beautiful Peruvian music and the delicious food. However, above all, it was the wonderful crew who made this trip so special. We were somehow lucky to have the three crew members, Rosario, Luis Flores and Enrique on both directions of our round trip, which were held three days apart. Each of them has a million dollars smile and a genuine desire to accommodate the passengers with any of their needs or requests. On the trip back from Machu Picchu, at night, the three of them surprised the passengers with a very unique show which we do not want to spoil for future passengers on this train. Needless to say, it was a most pleasant train ride which we very much hope to experience again in the future."

This was a very comfortable and interesting train ride that descended from the Poroy train station at about 12,000 feet to Aguas Calientes at less than 8,000 feet. It included negotiating at least one interesting manually operated train track switchback because of the dramatic grade, and the uphill return trip was considerably slower than the descent. Tables were set and a light breakfast was served on the trip out; this was repeated for a light afternoon snack on the return. We also had some entertainment and a fashion show involving baby alpaca products on the return leg. The views from the train were spectacular and the glass dome roof was helpful as we passed through some deep valleys. The cars were modern and clean. The cars do not connect so groups need to ensure they book assigned seats in the same train car if they want to be together. The staff in our car were very friendly and efficient hosts (Maritz V., Abdon, and Thon). They were also effective salespeople as I bought some of their baby alpaca shawls (which proved to be a great gift hit when I got home). This day trip by PeruRail train to visit Machu Picchu (connecting by bus between Aguas Calientes and the archeological site) is a great way to travel; would not recommend driving the tentative looking roads or getting eaten alive by the sandflies (that transmit Leishmania) on the 4 day march option."

Supposed to arrive in MP at noon. No information over the speakers, we had to try to elicit it from staff. They either knew nothing or wouldn't share it. \"Be patient, we're working on the problem\" is what we heard for nearly 2 1/2 hours. Then we were removed from the train (so little planning for an emergency that you had to jump from the train or be physically picked up by staff, not even a small emergency step ladder). Then we had to walk next to the train on the tracks for about 200 yards where we boarded another train. Finally arrived at train station at 3pm.We're told to be sure to return for our 5:30pm train on time (although we knew they were already delayed due to the derailment and there were already several hundred people at the station waiting to leave). Didn't get out of the station till 9pm, waited over 4 hours. We weren't even offered water and again very little information provided. This company clearly had no contingency or emergency plan except to just tell riders to be patient. Adding insult to injury, on the return trip we were fed a sandwich in old, dry bread with a single slice of cheese. We arrived at our hotel at 1:30am, exhausted and so very disappointed. Too bad they have no competition, maybe they would care more about the service they are supposed to provide. Their slogan is something akin to \"we create unforgettable experiences\". They're right, horrible and unforgettable."

When I booked the Vistadome online, the PeruRail website said that a buffet lunch was offered at Machu Picchu as a promotion for booking online. When we inquired at the restaurant after a gruelling Montana climb, they said that we were not on the list for the lunch. After about a 1/2 hour argument surmounting a pretty serious language barrier, we were told that we should have paid something like US$40 extra apiece to have the privilege of the buffet lunch. How can a hefty $40 per person extra be a promotion? There are many restaurants in North America where US$40 will fetch you a pretty decent a la carte dinner. Also, there must be almost a legal requirement that, if an attraction is soliciting a large clientele from North America and many other countries where English is commonly spoken, the people in customer service be adequately trained in spoken English. The scenery along the way being not much more scenic than, say, on a tour across the Scottish Highlands, being in the Vistadome is not a whole lot better than being in the Expedition. The attendants on Vistadome, however, spoke pretty good English and scored an A+ in my book for customer service."

This is a really nice rail with huge windows. The seats recline nicely. They provide food and refreshments, which was nice as well. They also sell items on the train, alpaca clothing & accessories. They do a fashion show to sell you the goods, which did create a fun vibe in our car. Unfortunately, it is like a fashion show that won't end & it carried on a bit too long. They also have a local folklore character that dresses up & dances. The train does make a difference on the tracks, we took the executive on the Inca Rail and it was a lot bumpier. My fiancee was joking about how it could not be the same tracks. We went on one of the later trains and spent some time riding in the dark. Unfortunately our train had to back up some distance because we took the wrong track that wouldn't allow us to cross. This caused us to arrive later than planned but we arrived. You will need a taxi to & from the station if you are departing/arriving to Cusco. Remember to bargain your taxi ride! The reason why I didn't give it 5 stars was because the fashion show went on way too long, in my opinion."

We really apprecited the effort for a relaxed break, after so many days trekking up and down. The only objection is about logistics: since this is the only possible way to reach Aguas Calientes without being killed by a crazy driver along the twisted road (7 hours of torture and stupid risk in a mini-van), PeruRail charges too much for any trip, if you are a foreigner. I understand the fund-raising purpose of any business but not if this comes from a off-shore company with little impact to the region and their locals (PeruRail is NOT from Peru but a foreigner company). Besides this stick-up moment, all along was nice and advice-able. Ro & Daniel"

Also, since there are large windows all around, your ride could be pretty exposed to the sun.

The seats are comfortable, bathrooms clean, staff friendly and helpful. They tell you there is a limit on the size of the suitcases allowed, however we did see some large full size ones on the luggage racks and did not notice anyone having to leave the train because their bag was too big.

Both trips were highly enjoyable. Would recommend planning at least one leg of the trip during the day or early afternoon, as the views are well worth seeing in daylight. The service was exceptional. Complementary snacks and drinks were provided during the journey. We enjoyed the fashion show put on by the employees - Indird, Ulorco Antonio, and Enzo. Very entertaining!"

Although the Expedition train was adequate for the trip from Cusco to Aguas Calientes, my return trip from Aquas Calientes to Ollanta was a world of improvement. The train, seats and tables were more spacious and comfortable with leather-like seats and a nice knit tablecloths and napkins. The coffee was delicious and the food much better than on the Expedition train. Not only was the a big improvement, but the staff consisting of Yulianna, Irvian and Sergio was superior. They not only served us food and drinks, but put on a dance performance and fashion show! We were treated to a fashion show of genuine alpaca sweaters and ponchos and the most amazing variety of coats, scarfs and other knitwear by Sol Alpaca. I was so impressed at how the women's knitwear could be transformed into so many different outfits. For example a simple scarf could become a poncho and be worn in 7 different ways. One poncho style knit was turned into a dress in 2 seconds. Amazing! It was so much fun and so comfortable that I barely noticed the time passing. The men's sweaters were also impressive and very tasteful. Luckily the items were available for purchase and I just had to buy one. However, there was no sales pressure at all."

We travelled on two Vistadome trains: one from Ollanta to Machu Picchu and the return from Machu Picchu to Poroy. I'd say the choice of seat (if you can choose) is quite important; my wife and I had rear facing seats so you don't get to see what's coming. I would have preferred forward facing seats. The windows in the ceiling are only on the edges so the view upwards is limited but it's still very good. The service on board is excellent with a snack and drinks being served during the journey, dancing and entertainment and a fashion show all put on by the Perurail staff!Journeys of 3 - 4 hours seemed to whiz by."

The train is clean, comfortable, the snack is average, nothing great, but you don't really care as the thrill of going to Machu Picchu is far too high to worry about little things like good food. On the return journey, we were tired, and as it got dark, there was nothing to admire outside the window. After serving the snack, the staff surprised us by putting on some entertainment, particularly a fashion show with alpaca-wool garments that were later available for sale. It was a great effort, and they were able to re-energize the entire coach. The train was delayed by 30 minutes on the way back, which was a bit of a bummer."

Be sure to take the train during daylight hours, so that you can enjoy the view beside you AND above you! Starting from the heights of sky-high Cuzco, the train rolls downhill and the climate changes every hour. First you will see Cuzco city and suburbs. Then beautiful evergreen-covered mountaintops. Then the cliffs are so steep, the train cannot do s-curves, so it uses Z-shaped switch-backs instead. In other words, the train rolls backwards-then-forwards 4 times to get down to the valley below. The valley is very narrow and the mountains go straight up 2,000 feet above you, so LOOK UP and watch for snow-covered peaks! The valley below is beautifully dotted with small, terraced farms. As the train rolls along the river, the climate changes to sub-tropical. If you watch closely, you will see orchids, heleconias, bromiliads, and other plants that are common to South Florida. (I live at sea-level in Fort Lauderdale, FL,so I certainly was not expecting to see those in the Andes Mountains!) You will be served a light but satisfying Peruvian breakfast along the way. Most of the Vistadome seating is euro-train style, meaning 4 people gathered around a table. We sat across from a wonderful couple for Los Angeles and had a terrificconversation! But for taller people (we are both over 6 ft. tall), the legroom in this configuration was cramped. Now let's talk about the luggage limit. Your PeruRail ticket will say there is a very serious weight limitation (approx. 15 lbs per person). Don't believe it! We went through all the hassle of downsizing our stuff to meet the weight limit, storing the rest of our luggage at our Cuzco hotel, then retrieving our luggage from that hotel and re-packing everything for our flight back to Lima. What a waste! At to Cuzco train station, several Vistadome passengers had very large suitcases and the PerRail porters gladly stowed their stuff for them on the train. In addition, each car has space at the exits to store your own bags. And there was no extra charge for either option. So why not take everything with you? (When we got to our hotel in MP, we asked the front desk staff about PeruRail's luggage weight limit, and they said, \"Everyone ignores it. We have never heard of a single time when it was enforced.\" Oh, yes, you and store a very small bag under your seat, but there is no overhead storage. Remember on the Vistadome, you have a glass ceiling to enjoy to overhead views. Happy rails!"

Sorry folks, not much to see. A few sections by the river had some fauna, but nothing too majestic. Given the early departure time, its a bit of a blessing to have 2 hours to nap on the journey, but the windows mean you have to sleep in full sun light. The train seats were comfortable, however it was a bit awkward navigating legs with your neighbors while sleeping, getting up or eating meals. There is quite a bit of rocking as the train rattles along the railways. If you suffer from motion-sickness, be warned.I was pleased to find they served a full meal, even though the tickets refer to them as \"snacks\". On the night train, there is a \"fashion show\" to sell pricey wool garments. This entailed 15-20 minutes of clapping along to music as the staff performed dances and catwalked. this is your only entertainment, however, as the night renders the windows useless. Again, there is some opportune nap time before the show.TIPS: bring ear plugs/eye mask/sweater to help you sleep. dress in layers: its cool on the train, HOT on the mountains! negotiate a ride back from the train station to Cusco with the driver who drops you off. guides are at the entrance at Machu; if you can grab a party of 4 its worth it to have your own personal guide take you around the site. the guides wouldn't bargain with us for a party of 2, so make some new friends."

The seats were awkward because we were forced to share a space with strangers... (each couple FACES each other) They kicked their feet a lot and there was no way to avoid them. 3+ hours of travel and this became annoying quickly. And if they are loud, relaxing and sleeping are out of the question. I wish they offered a vegetarian option...we were not able to eat the food which was a shame since it's a long trip & included in the price. The cups are small too but the coffee and tea are good and you can ask for refills.. the staff are very accommodating. We didn't like the fashion show since all we wanted to do was sleep.

The chairs were very comfortable and there was a small table which had a placemat on it and small plant. A light breakfast was served going down, this was a selection of pastries and hot drink, the return journey we had served a local dish made of corn meal and wrapped in corn husks, and two other small savoury bites. The scenery was stunning as it winds its way down the valley, plant life along the track was also very beautiful. After the staff cleaned up the meals on the way down they had a trolley of merchandise they pushed through the carriage for sale, the return journey we had a fashion parade showing off alpaca wool garments which was lovely, music and all. Overall I would highly recommend this train, very comfortable and time soon passed."

About 15 minutes before departure, I realized that I had accidentally taken someone else's bag. This meant that my own bag was still at the hotel, about an 8 minute walk away from the train station. I was taking the train to Cusco, where I would fly Cusco -> Lima -> Fort Lauderdale, Florida, USA -> JFK, New York, USA. I knew that if I missed this train I would then miss all of my connecting flights. Benjamin, who was working in the A section of the train, ran all the way back with me to my hotel to change the bags. We were running so fast across town and weren't sure that we would make it back in time. It was so incredibly kind of him and without his help I would not have made any of my flights or made it home.

We waited and they asked us to board only to find out that seats are apart. I told the staff, Juliana, that we will just wait for our original timing as we are not in a hurry but to my surprise they tore our tickets and did not open the door leaving us to endure the train ride apart. Why do they have to force people just to sell more tickets?!! I did not expect this kind of service with the value of the ticket.What a way to end our anniversary trip!!!"

This is a very civilized way to spend a morning or afternoon, watching the Peruvian countryside roll by. The train is comfortable and the onboard service is great. The train leaves on time and, usually, it arrives on time at your destination. Food is served and you can purchase a glass of wine or a beer. The restroom is generally pretty clean. We even had a fashion show on the way back to Cusco on the evening schedule. There are a couple of fascinating aspects as well. There's a road being built along the way. At one point the train backs up; it's a means of changing elevation. And there's one place where you can see SkyLodge, the hotel rooms that are hanging 400 feet up the side of a sheer cliff.

Completely different from trains in North America.The train itself was beautiful, with huge windows, comfortable seats, tables and one of the largest (and cleanest) bathrooms I've even seen on any mode of transportation. Announcements were clear and easy to understand. The snack was light, but tasty and not simply some bag of chips.And then there is the scenery. It was truly breathtaking and having all of those additional windows/larger windows clearly made all of the difference. Even for scenes that were on the other side of the train, the windows were so larger than it made no difference because no single person could possible block a window.

Getting to Machu Picchu from Cusco was quite the trip, taking a bus from Cusco to Ollantaytambo, then the train to Agua Caliente and finally another bus to Machu Picchu. By far, the most relaxing and pleasant leg of the trip was on Peru Rail, with the \"Vistadome\". The cars are clean and comfortable and the views are good. I would; however, recommend that you sit on the river side of the car, as the views are more spectacular."

Also during this time it is busy but not as busy as it gets in the summer. We took the vistadome up to Aguas calientes and back. It was such a scenic and relaxing ride. The staff were very efficient and welcoming to get us aboard. I had actually met one of staff members earlier that week, so it was quite coincidental I saw him working in the vistadome. His name was Alex and he was very accommodating and friendly! The service was great, and the food was nice. Not huge portions but nice size snacks to have along the way. There was also a little fashion show and traditional costume worn and danced in at the end of the ride which was fun! Although it is expensive, it is well worth it for an easy, relaxing, entertaining and scenic adventure:)"

Be sure to show up on time, because it leaves on time. It is important to have your passport handy because they will check it upon boarding. The train is very comfortable with a lot of windows to view the beautiful landscape. Leg room can be tight especially if the person across from you is either tall or decides to put their backpacks under the table. The food is decent, but nothing to write home about. It is worth bringing your own snacks/drinks. The bathrooms on board are actually very nice. They have little entertainment segments to help break the trip up. They also sell products during the trip and can be pushy at times. Overall, sit back and enjoy the ride to a natural wonder."

The glass roof enabled us to see the snow clad mountains and as night fell, the stars and moon. A light meal was included in the train cost and was very good. The entertainment was provided by PeruRail staff with one playing the part of a Saqra, an innocent mischief who performs a traditional dance in the Cusco Region. The staff then performed a fashion show when they modelled clothing (mainly coats, jerseys and ponchos) made from alpaca fibre. Great fun and well worth the cost."

Vera, Victor Hugo, and Amadeo went above and beyond to make everyone comfortable and entertained. They provided a fashion show and a mock celebration to exhibit some of the dancing and costumes from the Peruvian culture.

On the way back you get a snack and a costumed performer as well as a fashion show put on by the attendants - the scarves , jackets and coats were modeled to perfection to show off these items that are made of very soft alpaca and specifically for this train. Be prepared and bring lots of money as the items are pricey but well worth it - one scarf was transformed into a dress !

I was so tired, I slept almost the whole way. The train moved so slow and was an hour late getting into Poroy (the journey was 4 hours instead of 3 as we were told).If I hadn't been sick, I'm sure I would have really enjoyed the meal.

I returned to visit Machu Picchu after more than 30 years, the train then, was called the Tourists Train, as there was another one for the locals, that was a horror, then. In fact the trains do not leave from Cusco anymore, you are picked up at your hotel and then there is a 20 minute drive to Poroy, that is the station they use now for all the trains, apart from Ollantaytambo. The Vistadome is a nice train, seats are comfortable and the surprising thing was the catering service you have, with some juices and sandwiches or quiche, plus coffee, in any case, I thought there will be nothing and all this is now included, it is a service like on a plane,and arriving to Aguas Calientes, they will try to sell you books or scarfs, in a nutshell, there are other ways to travel, but the ride is as pleasant as it can be, as the train ride is a very slow one, as the rails are old. Enjoy the view of the river or the snow-capped mountains and it also allows you the longest time in the ruins, and you will arrive past 9pm in the evening to Cusco. Also the toilets are kept clean, and the staff is outstanding.The ride is a lot better than 30 years ago."

I tightened the pole straps around my wrists and leaned my upper body weight on the pole handles, the shock absorbing poles protected my knees from damage and discomfort on the way down. The sunshine warmth added more natural beauty to the Machu Pichu landscape. After walking and taking lots of photos of the Ancient Civilization, I took the bus to Aguas Calientes.I ate lunch, drank my first alcoholic beverage since I left the States, shopped for Inca Trail t-shirts then walked to the train station with a sigh that now my legs will get a well-deserved rest. My Inca Trail excursion included the Vista Dome train back to Poroy (Cuzco). I sat down on my assigned seat, no one next to me; I welcomed the freedom to sit next to the window or aisle using the Go-pro to capture the scenery and the comfort of the Vista Dome Train.A light Peruvian meal was served then Entertainment, a Peruvian folk dancer brought cheer to the passengers and later an Alpaca clothing fashion show was done by walking up and down the aisles.The train ride ended in Poroy where I was met by my driver to take me to the hotel. After four long days a hot shower with all the comforts of indoor plumbing was gratefully welcomed."

Your only option really is to choose which train. There's the super-luxe Hiram Bingham at almost $800pp roundtrip from Cusco. I thought about this for about a minute. I'm a picky traveler - I like nice hotels and generally to treat myself well. I just couldn't justify that expense on a train ride. Then there's the \"backpacker train\"/Expedition which I really didn't consider ($160pp roundtrip) or the Vistadome, the mid-range option at $180pp, which I ended up with. I was happy with choice. For an extra $20pp, there's no question that it's worth it over the Expedition for any bit of extra comfort you can get if you're riding on a train for over 7 hours in one day. And we passed by the Hiram Bingham - while it looked a bit nicer, I don't think it looked to be worth the extra expense. On the Vistadome, time passes quickly on the way to Machu Picchu. You don't really realize that it's 3.5 hours. There's pleasant Peruvian flute music playing in the background. Periodically, there are announcements about where you are or interesting facts. And you get a complimentary snack and drink (many people ordered cocoa tea) each way. The snack is a pastry with some fruit and a bit of quiche in the morning and in the afternoon, some candied nuts, tamale and a sweet. In the afternoon, your trip is broken up with some traditional dancing in the aisles as well as an Alpaca fashion show. It's a long time sitting down, but they do all they can to make it entertaining. Everyone is very friendly. And of course, the scenery is just fantastic. It would be nice to be able to select your own seats as you would on a plane. The seats are generally placed in sets of four, with two seats on each side facing each other over a table. It's somewhat awkward as you likely don't know the people in front of you and the leg space is pretty tight. I'd have much preferred the seats that are just two together (of which there are a few sets on the car). If this matters to you, you might want to send them an email to change your seat numbers (or visit any of the PeruRail offices in Lima or Cusco). The tickets advise getting to the station 30 minutes prior to departure. This is not necessary. 10 minutes prior is fine. But be on time -- because the trains leave promptly and you don't want to get stuck. My one complaint...near the end of the ride, after they brought out the Alpaca for sale, there was a large moth that flew around the car. It didn't seem to bother most people, but I have a really deep phobia of these insects. And none of the workers were really even paying attention or trying to get rid of it. At these prices, I really didn't expect to have moths flying around the car. We took a 6:40am train from Cusco, getting to Aguas Calientes just before 10am. Then we were on the 3:20pm train back. I found this to be the perfect amount of time to view MP. So overall, a really nice experience!"

The views unfolding out of the ample windows are breathtaking as you wind your way slowly through the majesty of the mountains and the raging Urubamba River. The service onboard is fantastic, staff are friendly, engaging and very efficient and its a nice touch to have your table set for you with locally made fabrics, plants and actual cutlery and crockery. The light snack is tasty and served with a smile. A couple of tips would be to try to be seated on the left hand side of the train for both ways of the trip - on the way up it seems to have the better of the views, particularly of the river and on the way back, you get to appreciate what you missed on the earlier trip. We were lucky enough to have a two-seat area for our trip out which was great for,our long legs. Most seating is in groups of four and it can be a little squeezy if you're tall. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend spending a little extra for the spectacular views from all the Vistadome windows."

The seats were comfortable but you face another couple so if you are long legged it might be a little tight. The windows are large and allow for great picture taking and views above your head of the tops of the canyon. Pulling off to the side track to allow passing trains is part of the charm of this train. It is one of the truly unique and comfortable train rides left in the world. Yes it is not cheap but you have probably traveled half way around the world see it all! Sit back and travel the Inca Train in style. The trip comes with a drink and a snack each way. The seats are all reserved by number so if you have a problem riding backwards get a front facing seat each way. Also there is one restroom on each car and negotiating the serving cart can be tricky like an airplane. However on the way back we were treated to a fashion show of local high end Peruvian fashions by the stewards. We were also playfully attacked by some sort of Peruvian folk entertainer. It kept us laughing.Go for it this is a great way to get to where you are going in Peru. The trains run on time too!"

The train has 3 levels and the Vistadome is the middle one, if I remember correctly. The top of the line is a posh traincar like the orient express from what I understand. The lower one is actually still nice (I rode both the lower and middle).To match the times I wanted to travel, the lower grade train was only available for one way of the round trip but I rode the Vistadome for the other. The Vistadome, aside from being nicer with more room, has a greater view as the windows are larger and wrap around to the ceiling. This is important as the route the train takes is through some of the most scenic landscapes. The food offered in this level (Vistadome) is also better and to kill the time the staff does a \"fashion show\" with some of the alpaca knits they are offering for sale. This helps kill the time and depending on the attractiveness of your staff, can be quite enjoyable to watch :)With the fashion show there is also a member of the staff that dresses up like some sort of an animal man thing and dances around the car. This sounds strange, but it is entertaining and adds to the experience without crossing over into the range of annoying. All in all, a great experience and I would recommend it."

You even get food, drinks and entertainment although this is in the rather bizarre form of a fashion show and some crazy psychedelic lion/cat creature performing a weird mixture of dance / mime / and general weirdness but this just made it even more memorable in a wayThe only down side is that seats are allocated randomly so you don't know if your getting a window or an aisle seat until you show up. Would be fairer If you could select seats when you book to secure the best seats. The best seat to get is a window seat on the left as they get the best views. I got allocated an aisle seat on the right but that didn't stop my enjoyment. I just stood in the exit alcove thing more or less the whole way up taking pictures and admiring the view"

When I first booked this train I thought it was very expensive, and didn't have much expectations of the service as it was in Peru (not sure why I thought that). However the journey was well organised and smooth from beginning to end and completely stress free. We has to use the 'bimodal' service (bus and then train) as the train doesn't run all the way in the rainy season due to safety. We took a cab to the bus station (Wanchaq station - about 5 min drive from main square in cusco). We were immediately met by a Perurail representative (from the door of the taxi even) and shown to our bus. The bus journey was about 2hours with no stops. The same Perurail representative accompanied us on the bus journey and even the train. On arrival at the train station, we were shown to our carriages by the same representative, and boarding was quick and stress free. We were in carriage A and had no problems with fumes, carriage was very clean, nice panoramic windows, didn't experience any misting up (but we went on a dry day). Snack on board included a pastry, fruit, spinach/cheese slice and soft drinks/tea/coffee. Similar snack on the way back. Was able to amend our ticket at Aguas Calientes (machu pichu) for an earlier train on the way back without any fuss. All in all, well organised, helpful and pleasant crew who accompanied us all the way and prompt, stress free service."

It was nauseating!The larger windows of Vistadome supposedly give you a better view of the scenery outside- well, the windows on my train kept fogging up, and me and my fellow passengers couldn't see much outside! Also, the windows near the roof of the train car were too small to see much of scenery outside. (I took the cheaper Expedition train on my return trip and I had a more pleasant ride than Vistadome).The worst part was their food: their quinoa pancake was bland despite being served with fruits; and then I started getting bad diarrhea a few hours after I ingested their food on the this Vistadome train... Coincidence? The diarrhea pretty much ruined my trip."

In my experience, this service should be called \"No-vistadome\" because the view from my $60 (one-way) seat at the end of the carriage was terrible. In the online booking process, I was unable to select my seat and I was automatically put in seat 51 of carriage B. The view from the seat was of the end wall of the carriage, the service staff and the toilets. To enjoy any kind of view I had to turn all the way around and glimpse the view the passengers on the other side of the table were enjoying. This is obviously not the case for all seats in the Vistadome service - most enjoy a fantastic view of the scenery...just not the ones at the end of the carriage. My advice would be to book through one of the ticketing offices in Cusco (there is one on the Plaza de Armas) so you can request a decent seat in advance. But the view os not the only reason I'm giving this a bad rating. The food was poor and for $60 I would expect to be offered a beer. I was not. Also there was no entertainment onboard, which the website suggested there would be. The carriage was quite hot and by the end of the journey it was quite uncomfortable at my stuffy end of the carriage. i expected more for my $60. Peru Rail and Inca Rail are the only companies licensed to operate tourist trains on the journey from Ollantaytambo to Aguas Calientes, the gateway to Machu Picchu. Since there is no road to Aguas Calientes, they can pretty much charge as much as they like. Tourists aren't allowed to ride on the locals train, which costs a fraction of the price of these 'scenic' services. It\u2019s also worth noting that you can no longer take the train all the way from Cusco \u2013 you have to get a bus, taxi or colectivo to Ollantaytambo first.In the interests of fairness, I should say that the train was clean and modern, and the journey was smooth and without incident. The boarding process was fine and the train departed and arrived on time."

But it's nice also to see all the scenery on your way up, which is why we didn't mind doing Vistadome both ways. The difference is only a few $ (or soles) so it did not matter much. Snacks were decent (better on the way up for us) and staff was really nice. If possible at all, try to get seats in the direction you're travelling.I definitely recommend it as part of the Machu Pichu experience!"

The great thing about the Vistadome is the all round views it affords , best book seats in direction of travel. A light lunch was served followed by a traditional Inca dance and a fashion show. The journey went quickly, however worth noting during the rainy season the train cannot go all the way to Cusco and the final part of the trip is by coach, which is not ideal ( this is normally January to March)"

The alternative, 'hiker train\" is less expensive but very crowded and on a regular train. The Vista-dome, includes a lite snack, fruit and coffee or tea. Going our train was air conditioned, but it was not working on our return trip so the opening the windows saved us. The seats are comfortable with a tri-fold table in front of you and there is a restroom in each car. The servers were friendly and helpful. You're a captive audience so during the trip, there's a sales' pitch to try an sell you sweaters, hats and such. A simple \"no thanks\" takes care of sales pitch and it's otherwise a very scenic ride to Machu Picchu."

Around 2 years ago, we went to Peru for vacation, we made our trip and I read in a web page that if you take the train you could go one trip in Vistadome and other on Expedition, so we did this kind of arrangement and bought them http://www.perurail.com/.So one way you can enjoy the advantages from kind of train, at the end one is cheapest than the other.Make sure to book your round trip (as well Machu picchu entrance) in advance, because it could be full if it's closed the date.The agencies could make the arrangement for all your trip in Peru but it could be more expensive. So we made own main arrangements in advance (hotels, Machupicchu entrance, train), when we arrived to Cuzco, we booked a tour to Sacred Valley in an agency (there are many agencies around the plaza of Cuzco, (but you need be careful not all are good, so you need to ask to Tourism Office which is better at this time ,it's closed from Cathedral ) When we finished the sacred valley our last place was Ollantaytambo , so we took the train there (I don't remember well but I think you need to stay 1 hr around in train station before your depart ) the train goes to Aguascalientes (we booked a hotel there).Earlier Morning from next day we took the bus to Machu Picchu (around 5:00 am) from next day (don't eat a lot food and drink famous COCA tea). The suggestion is to be before 6:30 am to see Sunrise. In Machu Picchu, there're a lot of tour guides that can provide personal or group tour in different idioms , we choice group tour , it's cheapest , and when the tour finished we climbed part of Machu Picchu mountain. In afternoon (around 4:00 pm , after our lunch time) we took the train to go back to Cuzco (include the bus in your train ticket, but there're taxis outside of train station too, take one in group if it's possible.)BTW, your luggage can't be too big when you go at train , it need to be fit , read specifications. Although , There are special place in one of the car to locate your luggage.Amazing Tour. Amazing view!! :) I love Machu Picchu YOU MUST BE THERE..it's an adventure and more if you made your own trip! hey don't forget to get enough cash when you go to Peru. because Credit card terminals are connecting through modem ,so if the phone connection is not working you'll be on trouble, as we were because sometimes the ATM machines don't work as our countries or not provide enough money limited at 250 dlls daily depends of the bank."

The train is good, the seats comfortable and we were provided with a light snack - pastry, fruit and beverage - on the way up, but nothing on the return.The large windows give good views as you ride alongside the river and through forest. The journey to Machu Picchu takes around three hours, and starts and ends at Ollyantaytambo in the Sacred Valley. After that it's a taxi, minibus or bus to Cusco. If you get a Vistadome ticket from Cusco to Machu Picchu (or vice versa), it inclues the bus fare. You can also get minibuses to Cusco very cheaply about 50m up the road from the train station in a parking area on the right - they leave frequently, as soon as they are full. We stayed at Ollyantambo for two nights on the way up and liked it very much. I should also mention that you can only take limited luggage (7kg), so leave any big bags in Cusco or Olly, even if you intend to stay in Aguas Calienta. We thought the train was probably a little pricey for what it is... but unless you wanna walk, it's the best (only) option."

The views of the Rio Urubamba and terrain are spectacular. If you want a real snack bring it yourself. They provide drinks though Peruvian coca cola is not good. I stuck to coca tea. Now for the bipolar part-- they call it bi modal. Second trip later that day was booked from MP to Cusco. I looked all over to see where they told us we would be bussed from Pashar to Cusco could not find it. So we get on the lovely train settle in for what we think is about 3 hours and are trundled off and loaded onto buses for a ride that ended in the ugliest part of any town I have ever seen and was Cusco the 3:20 train became the bus arriving at 7:35 or so. For our safety during rainy season. Fine."

Caught the Vistadome train from Aquas Calientes (train station for Machu Pichu) to Poroy (train station for Cusco) after travelling on the Hiram Bingham on the reverse route. Train departed Aquas Calientes at 15.20 and arrived at Poroy station at 19.00 so journey was a little over 3 1/2 hours.Booked our tickets online from the PeruRail site which was easy to navigate.Train is fairly comfortable with the seating configuration being 4 seats in each row - 2 either side of a central passageway. There are another 4 seats directly opposite, facing these, with a table in between such that 4 people are facing in the direction in which the train is headed and 4 are facing backwards. We had seats 42 and 44 which were both aisle seats but facing each other. There was ample room behind each of the seats that backed against each other to store luggage.As the term Vistadome would suggest the carriages do have clear places in the carriage ceilings where you can admire the scenery, as well as through the large windows, until such time as the sun sets. A little less than half of our journey was completed after darkness had set in.Service was good. A light meal (vegetable pasty, corn, a slice plus a non-alchoholic drink/tea/coffee) was included in the price. Alcoholic drinks could be purchased.Perhaps though the best part of the journey was the show put on by the train staff - the same people who had served our meal and drinks. First a guy in a mask and dressed very colourfully danced up and down our carriage. This was followed by a fashion show with both men's and woman's clothes on display, principally jumpers, coats, shawls and capes being modelled by our male and female carriage stewards. There was music and all the passengers really got into the show clapping and whistling both models who did a great job sashaying up and down the carriage aisle way. The clothes were later offered for sale. Fun trip.One tip though. Recommend that you book a car or taxi to pick you up from Poroy Station which is approximately a 30 minute car trip away from Cusco. The train arrived in darkness and there were literally a hundred drivers jockeying for position as they looked for business. Many of them had to wait outside the gates to the station, which was on an extremely busy main road, and this just added to the chaos and difficulty in departing the station precinct."

The service was great, the food was decent, and the view beyond spectacular.And the price was reasonable.Further, we decided to leave Aquas Calientes, from where we went to Machu Piccho, a day early. I found the Peru Rail staff in Aquas Calientes genial and helpful, and for a nominal fee we were able to leave a day early, and we ended up getting to Cusco earlier than we might have.I powerfully recommend Peru Rail as a means of transport around the country.The only reason I give four instead of five stars is that there was a commercial element to the trip; the lady who modeled the Peruvian garments was lovely and the show was good. But I could've done without it. (Ironically, I acknowledge that it might keep the cost down so, go for it! And we ended up sitting with a young Korean couple living in Guatemala and their company was delightful.Yes, I recommend it!"

The ticket prices were quite high. The trains were however of a high standard. The service on the trains was excellent. You are also provided with a snack and drink during the trip. The structure of the train with lots of glass windows allows you to take in the beauty of the landscape on the way to Machu Picchu."

Any travel agents charge you by adding their margin for the tickets. When you purchase the tickets at the office you need passport. Have it with you!   Currently most trains depart from Sacred Valley Ollantaytambo. So I recommend you to purchase 1) the transportation from Cuzco city to Ollantaytambo, 2) bus return ticket from Machu Pichu train station Aguascalientes to Machu Pichu and 3) Machu Pichu entrance ticket, through agent. 2) and 3) could be bought at Machu Pichu but you have to wait with long lines."

The decision to spend the last night in Ollytayambo was perfect. It was the quaint and spiritual local place that left the lingering amazement of this trip without going back to Cuzco where we spent the first three days. While a little further for the ride back to the airport it was a glorious morning with a stop at Chincerro and a drive through Cuzco outskirts. Vistadome is a good experience. The on board fashion show a little contrived but training alongside the roarng Urubamba through the mountains is a spectacle not to be forgotten."

One travels from Cusco through the outskirts (read: the poorest parts) and through the countryside to Puchar. Once on the train, it's a ride along the river leading to AC. The water is brown.

            "review": "Unless you are hiking, the train is the only way to Machu Picchu. People come from all over the world to see MP. A few hike in over several days, or hike just the last day.But the majority of them will be taking an overly long train ride on a rickety track, to a small town, and then getting on a small, packed bus going up a switchback road.There are a few trains to choose from; we chose the Vistadome. It is a pleasant train with lots of glass. Ideally, you want to be on the river side both to and from MP. If you are a party of four, some seats face each other with little tables. For example, travelling from MP back to Cusco, the seats 17,18,19,20 are in two rows facing each other with a table in between. 17 and 19 are windows looking out on the river side of the train (preferable) and 18 and 20 are aisles. If you are only two, 11 and 12 are two seats together (not facing other seats), and 11 is on the riverside of the train as you head back to Cuzco. I am not sure if the reverse is true on the way TO MP, i just noted our return seat numbers for this review.The tickets can be bought online via Perurail. It is a bit cumbersome with a lot of travellers because you need to type in a lot of data. Some fields autofill, be careful; mistakes are hard to fix and entail a penalty. Oddly, when you are done you get a receipt but not actual tickets (for fraud reasons), and you need to pick up actual tickets at the station, using your receipt. Like a lot of South American travel, their fraud problem with credit cards makes everything very cumbersome and time consuming. The train ride is quite slow, over flat terrain, but they keep it interesting. They play lively music, serve okay snacks, and have a goofy fashion show (which included a bit of selling pressure I did not appreciate). Overall though, it's fun, and while a lot of the landscape is boring, it does get prettier and more interesting the closer you get to Agua Calientes, the terminus.When you arrive at Agua Calientes, you are at the foot of MP. The only way up is by bus (Consettur, about USD 10). I saw no private cars or taxis (and we were staying at the only hotel at the top, so I imagine if there were a nicer way up, we would have known about it). Oddly, i thought, it is not immediately obvious how to get from the train to the bus stop, though a very high % of people are doing that. We had to wend our way through a market, over a bridge and down the street. Note, too, that if you do not speak Spanish it can be tricky; surprisingly few people speak English in the poorer countries of South America."

Four of us travelled on Perurail's Vistadome at the end of November 2014--from Ollantaytambo to Aguas Calientes early one morning and then back to Poroy (Cusco) late the next day. It turned out to be an essential part of our Machu Picchu experience. Great views of the diverse countryside; clean & comfortable seating; we were served breakfast on the trip to MP & a light dinner on the much longer return trip. Panflute music & narration on the way; fashion show & folk dance on the return. And, of course, the opportunity to buy books, CDs & clothing... A limited selection of alcoholic beverages was also available to purchase during the dinner service.The Perurail staff were professional, personable and succeeded in keeping a train car full of travelers from all over the world safe, comfortable & entertained. Special thanks to Dayano, Balbino and Alan for their great customer service!It cost US$ 62 for the trip from Ollantaytambo to AG; US$ 72 from AG to Poroy--even though that trip was twice as long. No matter, this unique Peruvian experience is worth every penny!"

This option to travel to Machu Pichu may be a little more expensive than the regular train but totally worth it.The process to get in the train was fast and organized, you should have the passport available together with your ticket. It allows the passangers to bring small bags due to the limitted space, I brought my little Carry on and it was perfectly fine. The train is clean and confortable with glass ceiling and big glass, panoramic windows which allows the passenger to feel closer to the mountains, the sky and the river that goes along during the trip duration. They served food and drinks, enough to hold you until you reach the destination. The staff is courteous and diligent. On our way back, they presented a typical dance performance and a fashion show with the different Alpaca coats, it was a lot of fun and simply entertaining.Tip: The best side of the train to seat is the left when going from Cusco to Machu Pichu, you will be amazed by the view, the river, the mountains changing colors and forms and the foggy sky, I can't describe with words. Enjoy the view."

Good web site, displays the choices, simple transaction. There are 3 classes of travel: Expedition (which is OK), Vistadome (with a better view) and Hiram super-luxury. We went one way by Vistadome and returned by Expedition. In my opinion, the upgrade to VistaDome is worth the moderate cost increase. Both stations have a waiting room with plenty of seats, a cafe, and clean modern toilets.The train arrived on time. Our seats were clean and comfortable. The train resumed motion promptly, and the trip took two hours, moving steadily along a spectacular steep valley. Our staff served us tea and sweet rolls, and sold beer to the thirsty. The train toilet was clean and functional.Overall, a well-managed train operation. TIPS: Print out your tickets! An electronic copy displayed on a smart-phone will not suffice. (PeruRail booths at Lima airport will print tickets)Bring only a small case; leave your monster suitcases in your previous hotel secure-room.You need to be aware of the locations of the train stations. We chose Ollantaytambo (about 2 hours car-ride from Cusco airport) as our start-end point, mainly to get used to altitude for 3 days. Aguas Calientes station is embedded within its town, easy walking distance to all hotels except the mountaintop hotel."

It is a well run train service, and the seats are comfortable. Buried in the fine print is a notation that you are limited to one backpack of 5 kilos or less. As we were planning on two nights in Aguas Calientes, we weren't sure this would work for us and angsted over what the rules actually were. We asked two different tour guides, who each basically said, \"You'll be fine.\" We squeezed the three of us into one small carry-on suitcase and three backpacks, and we were fine. They have a small rack that they store all of the small suitcases on, and if everyone took a separate suitcase, truly there would not be room. But, they had enough space to accomodate what people did bring.The VistaDome itself is an extra roof panel of windows on either side of the centerline of the train. This is helpful as the train winds through the Andes towards (and from) Aguas Calientes. The seating assigned and club-style, meaning that half the passengers will be traveling backwards. We were surprised on the ride back from Aguas Calientes that Peru Rail put on a fashion show, to sell some (beautiful) wool items, and also a dance routine by a guy in a harlequin-ish costume and mask. I personally don't enjoy these things, but there were some eastern european tourists on the train, and they REALLY got into it. To each his/her own!"

They were really friendly and had presentations of Peruvian clothing during the trip. The downside was the windows fogged up and the \"sandwich\" they served was a tiny slice of tomato with a drop of basil inside... it would have been better to serve nothing."

On the 5pm trip back to Cusco ( 3.5 hours) we were looking forward to napping as we had had a very early start, but after the food service there was some entertainment and \"fashion show\" of items for sale which though entertaining was not quite appreciated."

Still think is too much for the price if you compare to the living standard in Peru, for such a short trip of 3 hours only. I was told by an agency in Cusco, you can go by bus from cusco to Aguas Calientes, and is about 120 soles, last about 4 hours and u still have to walk for about an hour. This seems a lot cheaper. Shame I couldnt do it to tell my experience but I got to know when I had my ticket bought already."

The first is run by a consortium and all the money goes outside Peru, but we only found this out after booking and with hindsight would have preferred to book with Inka Rail. However, is all about the timing. The journey takes 1.5 hours. We paid $58 one way for the vistadome and choose the $63 Expedition back. Both were fine but the Vistadome is more comfortable. You need to be at the station 30 mins before departure. They give you a snack on the journey. You do this to visit Machu Picchu. Unfortunately you have to go via Agues Callientes.

My wife and I bought our tickets on the Internet, but due to a health problem we arrived in Cusco 24 hours later than expected, we had a reservation for the previous day on Peru Rail. We went to the train station and explained to them what had happened but they said we had lost our tickets and we had to buy new ones.How in the world can that be fair?. Flight delays, missed connections, weather problems and simple changes of plans happen everyday. But not in Peru Rail. You are not allowed any rights, We expected to pay a penalty for issuing new tickets but they would not accept any changes I have bought tickets for other services which are non-refundable and non reissuably, but they are real bargains at very low, low prices, but with Peru Rail their fares are higher than any other train in the planet.All airlines and train companies anywhere in the world will reissue a ticket (charging you a penalty) for an unused ticket. That is fair, but in Peru Rail fairness does not exist.So we lost $360.00. We bought our new tickets with Inca Rail, which has the same policy as Peru Rail but charges a little less than Peru Rail, for a comparative service.I have traveled with both companies before and neither one of them gives you back in service what you pay in cash.There are several agencies now offering to take you to Machu Pichu by bus for as low as $ 99.00 (including the entrance fee) which is about a third of what it takes to go by train.You cannot help but feel that they try to rip off the tourists, after all -they might think- if they are here make them pay. So one last Word of advice. If you are going to use their services, do not book Machu Pichu on your first day of travel, because if you have any delay and are not able to communicate with them you will lose the full value of your train tickets."

The staff is nice and the trip, although long, was relaxing.However, $80 US dollars for a 90km journey in Peru is like a joke. We payed 160 US dollars for both ways afford each person. As the only other way to get to machu pichu is by trekking for 3-4 days, it seems they are taking advantage of the tourists and the monopoly they have.Wish we had other options. Although having nice service I would have taken another cheaper way to Machu picchu is there was one."

The train is very clean, spotless washrooms, great food/snacks provided free of charge, and the train \"attendants\", (Judith, Domingo & Raul) were exceptional. Having booked seats is great so there is no stampede to find a good seat. There were 12 of us traveling together so it really didn't matter who we were sitting with (facing) but you might want to face whoever you are travelling with, if you prefer - it's also a great way to meet other travellers. There always is the \"cheaper\" train but this is well worth the extra cost."

They are the only trains that allow you to carry on a small piece of luggage (not sure if you still can). I read rumors several days before we were to leave that they were not allowing passengers to carry any luggage anymore. I emailed Peru rail to get verification that we could carry on small suitcase. When we arrived we did not have any problems about carry on a small bag plus our backpacks. There was a small storage area near the bathroom for extra bags. The train ride was very scenic from Ollantaytambo to Aguas Calientes. We were lucky enough to get seats on the river side. The ride was about 1.5 hours long. The seats were comfortable.

The ride is pleasant, the seats are comfortable and the service is decent. The only downside is that the ride from Poroy (near Cusco) is 3.5hrs long. It is slow and BORING. I would suggest touring sites in the Sacred Valley and getting the train in Ollaytambo where the ride is only 1.75hrs.Seat are four each, two pairs facing each other with a table in the middle. Be sure to request a forward facing seat if you get motion sick. Each car has a restroom, but patrons are restricted to the car of their seat (unlike Amtrak)."

A car with a glass dome on it so it was possible to see 360 degrees around. This was basically the larger window train car with glass panels in the roof. My wife thought that they might be larger than the ones on the first trip. But the service is much better. You get table runners and a much nicer snack, and I should have bought a beer. And each car gets a fashion show to entertain you when it gets dark. It was an interesting experience and I am glad that I did it one way."

Step 2: Board the VISTADOME train (definitely the best Perurail train) from Poroy Station to Aguas Calientes at around 6.30am. You will need to take a 20 minute cab ride from your hotel in Cusco to the Poroy train station to catch the Perurail. The train ride is around 3 hours. You will arrive in Aguas Calientes, which is a town at the foot of Machu Picchu. You will want to hustle from the train station to the bus stop (you'll walk through a market, over a bridge to get to the bus stop. just look for the big buses). Next to the parked buses, there is a ticket window where you will pay around $11 for a bus ride up to Machu Picchu that takes about 20 minutes. Board bus immediately. You'll have time to enjoy the little town of Aguas Calientes after visiting Machu Picchu. The bus will take you straight to the entrance of Machu Picchu, where you must present your ticket (purchased beforehand; it sells out) and passport. The return is easy too: get in line for the bus at the entrance to Machu Picchu, take it back down to Aguas Calientes, explore the town a bit while you wait for the departing train on Perurail. So much simpler than the internet makes it seem!As for Perurail: it is such an awesome experience. I took both the Vistadome train and the Expedition train and the Vistadome train is definitely worth the extra $12 or so. The seats are comfortable, they provide a small breakfast which is yummy, and the train has huge windows as well as windows on the roof to enjoy the view. The train experience was fantastic, and the staff was incredibly nice to everyone."

If your looking for relaxing luxury for a fair price, look no further. its a 3hr slow ride through beautiful countryside, awesome views, dotted with interesting culture.Do yourself a favor and plan your trip so that you start your trip in Aguas Caliente. You can if book your flight to coincide with the Vistadome departures from Poroy Station. You can sleep on the train. The sooner you get out of Cuzco the first day the better chance you have of avoiding Altitude sickness (MP is much lower than Cuzco). I suggest you fly from Lima to Cuzco, get a taxi from the airport to Poroy Train Station on the Vistadome (excellent service and comfort) to MP (Aguas Calientes). If you intend to go to Wayana Picchu (I highly recommend it) plan for 2-days in MP. On the trip back, Vistadome from MP to Ollantaytambo, spend a day there. its a great place to see a few more Inca Ruins. And get a taxi from Ollantay to Cuzco (80 Sols). Yes, its and hour and a half of beautiful countryside and the added benefit of taking you to your Hotel directly. It will cost you $40 Sols from the Poroy train station to your hotel anyway. This way, by the time you get to Cuzco, you have incrementally gone form an altitude of about 7800 (according to my phone App.) Ollantay is at about 9100, and Cuzco is at 11200 roughly. By the time you get to Cuzco you should be acclimated. I was one of 4 persons ranging from age 52 to 62, and we didn't experience any sickness at all. Have a Great trip."

The views were magnificient and since all the coaches had open glass tops -we could see the cloud topped peaks all around us.The staff was extremely courteous, service was great.

Apparently the staff do get a commission from the sales at least. We were suckered into some of the alpaca items, where we later found them for much cheaper in shops in Cusco...however, I would say, if you see a certain color or design you like, it may be worth the extra cost to just buy it on the train.

However, it's peculiar that my first attempt to buy Peru Rail tickets online was successful - yet the second attempt a few minutes later failed - the same credit card that was accepted on the first purchase was declined for the second try. Peru Rail did follow up with an email within 24 hours to instruct me to fax my credit card information to complete the purchase. If you prefer to buy your ticket in person, there are several Peru Rail (as well as Inca Rail) ticket locations in Lima (including the airport), Cusco and elsewhere in Peru. The staff at these places are English-speaking and friendly - albeit slow (typical!)The Peru Rail cars seem to be more modern - and they ride noticeably softer than the Inca Rail cars. Since they use the same railroad, the difference must be due to better suspension on the Peru Rail cars. Other than that, the service are of similar quality (very good) on both rails. The both offer some snack on beverage during the ride. One recommendation: when you purchase your tickets, make sure you ask for forward-facing seats!! This is important if you are susceptible to motion sickness - or if you want to take photos. Also, if possible travel during daylight hours - so you can see the beautiful mountains. The fare on Peru Rail is more than that on the Inca Rail - check both if you travel on a budget."

The food was excellent...snack and drinks. The seats were luxurious with room for our packs and bag. We took only one bag as we were told space was limited but there was room. However it was easier to deal with one case. On the way back we enjoyed talking to a British couple, sharing a bottle of wine and playing games. It was so relaxing and the food was really a surprise...very tasty. We also loved the comfort and efficiency. And I want to mention our staff who were very friendly, helpful, and fun! We enjoyed the show that Zulca Luna, Cesar and Diego put on. They were gracious and attentive. Many thanks for a great journey."

I did not think that our vegetarian empanada was so great. Two years ago we had a bar service before the meal. Leaving at 15:30hrs, no need to rush with food. Service was still good, but just felt like there was a cut back. Still a good way to go to Macha Picchu from Poroy."

Though I think Peru Rail only charges 14USD more which might be worth it. I found the Vistadome to be slightly cleaner and less cramped than the Expedition cars though not by much. Expedition cars also had great viewing out the windows. The food served on Vistadome was not a full meal - it was about half a meal (1 small empenada, 6 gooseberries, a small cookie, chulpi), see the photo I attached. You'd still want to eat another meal before or after the ride. The whole ride seemed like a ridiculous show to get you to buy Peru Rail items for sale (shawls, vests, coats, etc) though it does pass the time."

May be better to move the show for the ride going in when people is awake and may be a very good distraction to make time go fast."

I was disappointed at first as we had to share a four top table with another couple. I got over that quckly BUT found the space VERY TIGHT and uncomfortable. The seats were too close together. Then the man across from me, kept his feet over the halfway point so I couldn't even put both of my feet flat on the floor-not fun for 3.5 hours. Also on the ride up we had multiple hard stops and clanking-sometimes throwing the passengers off a bit. I could not wait to get off this train. When it was time for our return, I changed to the shorter route to Ollantyambo-only 1.5 hours-again, miserable, but for a shorter period of time. So glad we that as we took a taxi back to Cusco and were able to really see the Ururumba valley-which we couldn't really see on the train.Not to sound like a complainer-but my husband and I LOVE train travel normally-so we are experienced train travelers."

We took the Vistadome train from Ollantaytambo to Aguas Calientes, and then 2 days later trained back from Aguas Calientes to Cusco (or actually to a town just outside Cusco, but that's as close as you can get). It is not cheap, but I think it's worth the upgrade from one of the other trains. The windows in the ceiling allow for amazing views of the Andes on the way, hence the name Vistadome. It was a smooth and relaxing trip, with comfortable seats, decent bathroom, and pleasant crew. They served us snacks and beverages on the way, and played some pretty killer pan flute music to get us pumped for Machu Picchu.On the way back, maybe because it was a longer train ride, the crew put on an alpaca clothing fashion show. It was hilarious, they used the aisle as a runway and really werked it. Of course the purpose was to get you to buy some of the clothing, but it wasn't high pressure and did serve to entertain us for 20 minutes or so. Then another crew member dressed up as a Peruvian folk character and danced around, taking pictures with everyone. Again, unexpected and entertaining. One thing to note - there is no luggage storage on some of the trains except for what you can fit under your seat. On the train back, there was just a little area at the front of your cabin. So we packed small duffle bags or backpacks for just the 2 days, and left our big luggage back in Ollantaytambo for our travel company to transpo for us back to Cusco."

We had barely pulled out of the station and were being served a hot cup of Peruvian coffee and a light breakfast. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The train was immaculate, the ride most enjoyable and the washrooms were also very clean. I have not had the privilege of travelling on European railways but have travelled extensively on Canadian railways in their day. Peru Rail and their Vistadome cars are a wonderful way to view the area as you travel to visit Machu Picchu. This is a 90 minute trip and worth every minute on board. I appreciated that they sold some souvenirs on board as at no other time did I find bandanas on my trip in the two weeks we were in Peru. I also enjoyed the show and seeing Moche on the return trip two days later. At no time did I feel obligated to purchase anything on board and the staff were all extremely polite and represented their company and their country very well.

I found it to be adorable rather than overbearing; the staff seemed to really enjoy it and there was no pressure to buy anything. The seats on the train face each other in groups of four- keep in mind if you'd like to sit across from your companion instead of next to them. The train departed and arrived on time."

The river was gorgeous and flowing fast. On the way back to Ollantaytambo, the servers put on an entertaining fashion show. If you show interest, though, they will focus on you and try to push their sales harder. Otherwise, watch with ambivalence."

The breakfast was nice too.The way back was ok until the 'entertainment' started. We found the whole thing a bit much. The traditional folklore character was really creepy (judging by my photos, everyone else in the carriage felt the same) and we thought the fashion show was all just a little awkward, for both passengers and the staff. You really are a captive audience on the train and whilst it wasn't a particularly hard sell, we just found it all a little uncomfortable.I'd still recommend doing the journey as the pluses by far outweigh the negatives, but just be prepared for the return journey to be a little weird.Oh and bring headphones - the 3 pan pipe songs on repeat start to get tired after the second hour :o)"

My husband and I took the Vistadome train from Poroy to Machu Picchu and the Hiram Bingham train from Machu Picchu to Poroy (see separate review of Hiram Bingham).This is advertised as a more affordable option but it is still relatively luxurious. The train is pretty much like any UK long-distance train. It was clean (didn\u2019t check out the toilet, though), the \u2018snacks\u2019 served on board turned out to be a tasty breakfast with a greater level of service and attention to detail than I had expected and the views were just gorgeous. They played Andean pan pipe music throughout the trip. My husband, who was trying to sleep, found it annoying but I thought it contributed to the atmosphere and was a great addition.We took the Hiram Bingham train back in the evening from Machu Picchu and of the two options, I thought the Vistadome train was definitely much better value for money. If you want to try both options, I would take the Vistadome to Machu Picchu in the morning and the Hiram Bingham back to Poroy in the evening since the Vistadome had much bigger windows (also up in the ceiling) so it would provide a better view since it will be pitch black once you start your trip back to Poroy. Also, the Hiram Bingham train has a lot of drinks that are included in the price and I felt that it was nicer to enjoy those on the way back than to arrive to Machu Picchu completely hammered. The Vistadome train was also quieter and did not rock back and forth at all as much as the Hiram Bingham train did (this might partly also have been due to it being dark outside). I had to take a seasickness pill on the Hiram Bingham train because I got nauseous (and this was before the alcohol!) whereas I had no issues on the Vistadome (and I get motion sickness relatively easily)."

Four seats share a table, so unless you have four people, you will be pared up with others.. a nice way to make new friends. We took the evening train back to Poroy, so lost the light a bit into the trip.. I would have enjoyed watching the river the whole way back. Instead, we were given a nice snack.. I'm not sure I'd call it a meal.. there were corn crunchies (popular in Peru), as well as raw gooseberries (delicious!), a vegetable empanada and a really yummy short bread sort of desert. Not a huge meal, but enough for a decent snack.After our meal we were treated to a fashion show for one of the Alpaca clothing companies. The stuff was quite nice and the models (the train personnel) looked like they were having a good time. Unfortunately the products they were showing are ridiculously expensive, but it was still quite nice and a good diversion.Then they put the lights out and this crazy character came through the car, dancing with passengers and just being crazy... it was quite funny.The Vistadome is certainly nicer and much more comfortable than the backpacker train, and worth the cost to take it in the day, when you can see everything. The evening trip was enjoyable, but you don't see much of the countryside."

This is the slowest train I've ever been on. But The seats are comfortable. they serve a small snack and a drink.Before you enter the train you must show your ticket with your passport. Your luggage is loaded on by the staff in the same car that you are in. Once you arrive at your destination your luggage is unloaded by the staff and placed on the platform for you to grab. We were in car A and the exhaust from the front of the train kept coming in. It was pretty nasty. The other annoying thing is that the horn is sounded every 5 minutes. There's a lot of people that walk along the tracks and that's the reason for sounding the horn so much. Annoying!The sun shines right through the vistadome so wear a hat if you are sensitive to the sun. Despite some of the cons this is still the best way to get to machu picchu."

Scheduled by our tour company, we had went on Expedition train going and then Vistadome on our return trip. The Vistadome train employees offered a 30 min. fashion show featuring alpaca products on the return trip. I'm not sure if our tour company had booked these tickets late, but we ended up in seats apart from one another. 3 seats together and 1 solo seat elsewhere. Our teenager happily took the solo seat and was happy with it (ha, ha). Family of Four (2 adults, 2 boys ages 16 & 11). Clean bathrooms on board, and snacks and drinks offered. FYI: Some seats are arranged in groups facing one another. Since we had departed in the afternoon, I'm guessing most people were leaving after visiting MP -so, the whole car of people seemed a bit more chatty than compared to our morning train trip going to AC. The train stopped in Ollantaytambo, where we had a private taxi (arranged by tour company) waiting for us to drive back to Cusco.From what I understand by asking others (including a taxi driver)...train service does not go to Cusco, but rather passengers would need to depart from either Ollantaytambo or Poroy stations.

We had paid for the upgrade through the company we booked the trek with and had a great trip back.The train was very comfortable and had plenty of space, also the food was great.What we didn't realise was that we were also getting entertainment which was fun, with dancing up the isles. Before the fashion show, with the llama products available to purchase. Thanks again it was very relaxing after a hard 4 days."

With that in mind, PeruRail's Vistadome is one of the best, most comfortable, and most imaginative options with the most hard working and considerate staff. This is a four hour ride each way and the trains are always full, so these employees go above and beyond patience and maintaining a positive attitude. PeruRail has a less expensive option, and also has a train that costs as much as a five star hotel, but just like Goldilocks, this one is just right."

Windows at every angle for full sight of the incredible views? In one word...? HORRIBLE. Not only is this a nearly 4 hour train ride (each way) leaving from Cusco at an unGodly hour in the morning, it is expensive, the employees are not friendly, if you aren't lucky you could be sitting BACKWARDS the whole way, and if you have even the TEENIEST propensity towards motion sickness this train ride will be a living nightmare for you. They play this horrid cheesy Peruvian music at the same volume as a club (at 6 IN THE MORNING??), and the best part you ask?? The train JERKS from side to side SO VIOLENTLY that your drinks and belongings will fly off the table in front of you. This is like a roller coaster ride from the depths of darkness. WHAT KIND OF TRAIN SWINGS FROM SIDE TO SIDE? FOR THE ENTIRE RIDE? The guy across from us got scalded with hot coffee as the waiter slipped and knocked over his coffee cup after the train THRUST him about as if he were a rag doll. They served food and drinks but I was so sick I couldn't even look at it. After arriving into Aguas Calientes my entire body was vibrating. Even with a double dose of Meclizine I felt awful! Then...I got to get on a bus for another 25 minutes up the side of a mountain around hair pin curves, on a road only wide enough for one vehicle and having to pull over to let other busses pass. FUNNNN! Finally...to top it off, after a completely ANTI-climactic experience at Machu Picchu, the train ride home was even WORSE, if you can believe it. Same deafening music but NOW they had people dressed up in costumes like Peruvian folklore characters RUNNING UP AND DOWN THE AISLES SCREAMING and getting in people's faces. All the while, they had a fashion show of insanely overpriced clothing and goods that they were aggressively trying to push on to everyone. I was nearly hysterical by this time. I just pulled my hood over my head and prayed for it to be over. I have never experienced anything quite like this in all the travels of my life. I wouldn't do this again for a million dollars. Horrific experience."

It also gave an email address if you needed to contact them to discuss this sudden change in policy. My travel agency sent an email to the address given and it Bounced Back.I've purposely bought my tickets on the 501 and 504 so I can Check my bags. The 501 leaves from Ollantaytambo, my Sacred Valley hotel is near the train station in Urbamba and so I gave up the location convenience to be on the trains that allowed Checked baggage. My small group and I are staying in Aguas Calientes for Three nights, not the usual one night, so a small overnight bag won't do.I have contacted PeruRail today and so has my travel agent - we are waiting for a response. It will be interesting to see if they will Honour the Service they Advertised at the time I purchased my tickets and allow me to bring my over 5kg luggage. According to Wikipedia 50% of it is owned by the international company Orient Express. If you have bought tickets on the 501 or 504 Perurail trains and expect checked baggage service I urge you to contact them.I will keep my Tripadvisor readers posted on the service I ultimately receive.As of today, I am giving them an average rating which I will change in a few days, up or down, based on their response."

The train to Machu Picchu was below expectations for the Vistadome. Yes, it had big windows, but was nothing to the luxury level that we had experienced on a Vistadome train in Alaska the prior year. Seats were adequate, but my guess is either it was very old, or they had tried to pass a backpacker train off as a Vistadome. A cold snack was served and the attendants lug a cart around trying to sell you things which is annoying. On the way back the train was a significant improvement. Truly a Vistadome roof and a seriously upgraded interior. Food served was a hot snack with linens and silverware. The staff performed a fashion show - which was fun (despite the fact they were again trying to sell you stuff). It was disappointing that the seats were all set in groups of 4. Not that we aren't social, but this means that 1/2 the folks are traveling backwards which bothers many. Other trains like this i've seen have the seats all facing forward and then if you want you can turn them around to form a group. Overall a decent experience. The view is amazing, the train good, the food so-so."

Although the train ride was scenic, I was slightly annoyed that we were not seated \u201ctogether\u201d on either leg of the trip. Unfortunately when booking tickets, you have no control over the seat selection. The train ride can take up to 4 hours as it travels very slowly through the terrain and makes one seemingly LONG stop along the way. The seats were comfortable leather but had limited leg room. I say this because if you\u2019re seated at a 4-top you are sharing leg room with the person in front of you and if you\u2019re seated in the aisle seat, your legs straddle the table support. The Vistadome train included a tasteful light breakfast in the morning (quinoa pancakes, spinach torte, with fresh fruit) as well as a light snack (small slice of cold pizza with fresh fruit) in the evening. Ambient Andean music played throughout the trip but appeared somewhat loud and repetitive at times, or maybe it was the lack of rail noise that amplified this change. The train staff; Wendy, Erick, and Jose, were very friendly and provided representative dances of the Andean culture as well as a fashion show on the return trip to the Poroy Station. Both designed to engage the passengers as it was too dark to see the passing landscape.Be sure to plan ahead and arrange a taxi to drop you off in the morning and retrieve you in the evening. Each way shouldn't cost more than 30 Nuevos Soles."

In fact taking the bus up from Agues Calientes to Macchu Picchu is more exhilarating and breath-taking. I have taken trains in Switzerland that offered better viewing opportunities of the landscape and surrounding. The vistadome glass windows are not quite clear for views and had obstructions from various angles. For just the experience of riding on the Vistadome, perhaps a one way trip is sufficient. Overall the ticket price is also quite steep for the value."

Tickets can easily be booked in advance via the Peruvian Rail website but it's not possible to book specific seats, so it's pot luck if families/friends are allocated seats together. Be aware that there is also a baggage allowance of 5 kilo p.p - we only noticed this at the last moment in the small print on our ticket. There is limited luggage storage space on the train, but some people did have large cases - the rule didn't seem to be enforced. There is a left luggage facility at the station. A snack is also served and is included in the ticket price. Again, there is no choice of food, so veggies may miss out. Staff are very courteous, and go out of their way to ensure that passengers have a good trip. The train is comfortable and large windows afford fantastic views, although if you are seated at one end of the carriage, depending on the way the seat is facing, you may miss out a little on the 'Vistadome' experience."

If you get a window seat on the Expedition, I don't see the Vistadome being much of an upgrade. Though I'm not sure what the price difference is between the two. The trains seemed to depart very promptly. Our train stopped for 1 hour on the tracks on the way back. This was a little annoying as I was so beat after 2.5 days of hiking around Machu Picchu. As we were stopped, the crew had some sort of fashion show where they were pushing Peru Rails wears. This is a Chilean owned company so I thought that was funny."

That's after moving your seats away from pushy tour guides, nosy nasty old lady travellers form Canada, and obnoxious spoiled teenage travelers who insist on putting all of their bags where your feet should be. We don't really recommend taking the Vistadome \"upgrade\", this is not a dome train as all travellers know it, the vista part is simply smaller windows along the roof line of the train which do not add much to the trip or view. Make sure your booker or you determine which direction your seats face, you want to be facing towards Machu Picchu going up, and towards Cusco going down. If you don't select your seats you may get seated at a 4 table with people you don't know across or next to you. We moved our seats going up, and met amazing folks, and rode down facing a great couple we met while hiking on Machu Picchu so all ended up ok. Also, the 13lb bag limit is a myth, some on ours trains had huge roller bags, the 40lb variety, and none of the train personnel cared. Note that they try to sell you anything and everything going both ways. The return trip is basically a bad cheap stage show with dancing, singing, and attempts at parading \"alpaca\" up & down the aisles for sale, plus pisco sours also for sale. Most of it is laughable, except for watching uneducated tourists buy \"alpaca\" which is clearly acrylic and wool or alpaca mixed, for inflated prices. When you get off of the train, you won't want to feel like you've been had, so keep your cash in your wallet. Also be careful about your belongings, things move around and so do you, smaller items can get lost or end up under the seats, and you will find it nearly impossible to retrieve them. This is an ok way to get to Machu Picchu, however keep your expectations real."

The train is moderately expensive but cheaper than the Hiram Bingham. Unfortunately when you buy your tickets you are assigned seats and some seats face backwards which may be uncomfortable to some travelers. In addition, those on the left side of the train going down to Aguas Calientes had some great vistas of the powerful Urubamba river. The train was on time and the staff help load the luggage onto the train. We had a medium sized roll away and did not face any questions by staff. Seats are comfortable and there are two seats across a table from another two seats. This means that you are generally looking at and across from two people you do not know unless you are traveling in a group. We were served a snack and drink on the train ride to Aquas Calientes and enjoyed the views from the windows along side and above our seats. The return to Cusco was longer and more tiring (about 4 hours). We were served a light dinner and then there was a \"fashion show\" with the train staff modeling Alpaca wear for purchase. They also had a member of the staff dress up as Chupacabra and do an Andean dance for the entire train! For the better part of the ride, there is music playing in the train car and sometimes quite loudly. For the longer journey home, the music repeated itself until someone actually asked the staff to stop repeating the same sound track again and again. The music did impact our ability to rest on the way back home especially since the evening train travels in the dark to arrive in Poroy around 9 PM."

The seats are more comfortable than the lower priced Expedition train but the food service was about the same, just a bread roll with a piece of cheese and tomato. However the staff on this Vistadome train were exceptional. Rosemery was informative in discussing the Incan culture, and Rosemery, Domingo and Denys were all very attentive to providing good service, even though what PeruRail offers for this upgraded price is very basic, nothing extra in the way of food or drinks. What really made the Vistadome a more enjoyable experience was the staff and the entertainment. Domingo, dressed in a costume, was charming and entertaining with his dancing, Rosemery and Deynis modeled beautiful alpaca clothing and were very helpful in showing us how to wear the different items. We had no intention of purchasing anything but they were such charming sales people we ended up buying two alpaca shawls!"

We travels from agua calientes to cuzco on vistadome, and I am so glad we did. out train is at 3.20pm and arrived at cuzco around 7.30pm. the speed for the train is about 30 mph. The sky went dark around 6pm so after dark there is no point to be in the vistadome since it's very dark outside. But I really enjoyed the train ride, the seats are comfortable and spacious, I sat with a local andean lady and a brazilian tourist, we had wonderful exchanges on our peru experience. The train is very clean and beautiful. I enjoyed the snacks on the train and all the shows, although the guy in the mask is a bit disturbing looking lol. I really enjoyed the alpaca fashion show, it is a great idea.The only down side I think is that the music is way too loud, but apart from that everything is top notch. It is quite expensive but it is a once in a life time experience, so it's worth it."

However, on the way back to Cuzco, the train derailed, not enough to tip us over, but enough to be quite scary. On top of that, they would not let us get off of the car while they were trying to fix it(at least I assume that's what they were doing but all we kept seeing was men bringing rocks over to the tracks) we kept asking to get off or stand on the other cars since ours was the only one with a problem but that was apparently deemed unsafe for us to stand on other cars while we sat in the derailed one which shook back and forth every time they tried to fix it. It got dark and it was not pleasant in the least. They did bring the alcoholic beverage cart back out, but you still had to pay for drinks. Eventually they gave us free soft beverages or beer or a tiny cup of wine.  We ended up sitting on the train for two hours before they had us evacuate, at which point we found out that they detached our car and the rest of the train went on back to Cuzco. Meanwhile it was pitch black, luckily I had a flashlight, and we had to walk back down the tracks with our luggage to ollantaytambo where we were put in buses to take us back to our hotels. They took our hostel/hotel names and addresses and then still just dropped us off near the plaza. It was only a few blocks to walk but after all of that, plus being two females at night in a foreign country, we were not happy at all. I tried emailing and calling and have gotten no response."

Ideally, one should pay the slight extra for this train and plan for at least a one way trip during daylight hours. You are traveling thru a valley, which is exceedingly tight and narrow in places, coupled with tall growth on one or both sides of the train at times, so the roof windows allow you to see what will otherwise, at times, not be viewable from them side windows. Additionally, when you get the wider openings, the roof windows really shine as the view is almost 180 degrees from side to side.The roof windows also allow you to get a preview of what scenery is coming, and lets you see the tops of the mountains, some snowcapped, some shrouded in the mists of the clouds. It truly is quite the sight! However, if you are traveling when it's dark, I doubt there is much advantage to this train, and personally would save the money and take the Backpackers train.As for luggage, I heard many times you may not bring more than X weight/size/volume on the train. I have not read the ticket rules and restrictions, but don't doubt that there is something in there about that, technically. My experience, from two trips on the VistaDome, was that large, oversized baggage and luggage rules were not enforced whatsoever. As a matter of fact, they even made announcements upon station arrival to wait to disembark until they could offload the large luggage! And some people had quite the collection of full on traveling luggage. in both the trains I was in. There is no additional storage by your seat for it, so it goes in the center by the entrance to the carriage, all stacked together- although some backpackers were putting their large packs inbetween the seats, in the space where their backs were adjacent to the next seat backs."

            "review": "Very Nice Train. We took the Vistadome train roundtrip from Poroy to Agua Calientes. Poroy is the closest stop to Cusco, a 20 minute taxi ride. Agua Calientes is the train station for Machu Picchu. It's a small interesting town on the Urubamba river and nestled in the rain forest that supplies lodging, restaurants and shopping for the thousands of tourists that descend here. It's also where you catch the bus up to Machu Picchu. (You can walk up or trek but it's an extensive uphill climb). The Vistadome train exceeded our expectations. We sat in the first class cabin which was very clean and comfortable. We had waiter service and a light meal was served on each route. In our case this was breakfast (fruit, pancakes, coffee, juice) and an early evening snack (pizza, nuts). The trains large windows look out on the countryside surroundings and Andean music is piped in through speakers. The staff has a bit of fun by putting on fashion shows and modeling the local Alpaca woven clothing, which is of course for sale, or by dancing thru the aisles dressed in Incan costumes. This was silly fun for the passengers, and revealed a light side of Peruvian culture that helped pass time during the 3.5 hr ride."

Most things in Peru are really cheap. The exception is your trip to Machu Picchu. We paid $165 for the train, $20 for the bus ride up and around $45 to get into Machu. Don't get me wrong, it was well worth the expense. It's just annoying."

            "review": "Enjoyable train ride. We caught a 5am flight from Lima to Cusco then headed to Wanchaq station by taxi to catch an 8am bus. The taxi ride will take you 10-15 minutes and cost about 30 soles. We actually organised the taxi through one of the hotels that had a stand at the airport. This seemed a much safer option than randomly picking one off the street. At the time of our holiday (just after rainy season) they were using a bi-modal method of getting you to Machu Picchu, the journey from Cusco to Aguas Calientes was made up of a 90 minute bus ride from Wanchaq station to Pachar station and then a 2 hour train ride the rest of the way. The bus ride was a bone shuddering experience over windy mountain roads. Quite a few of the passengers, myself included, were feeling quite sick by the end of the journey.The train ride however was very enjoyable. It travels quite slowly giving you the opportunity to take in all the scenery. I recommend that you have a hat and sunglasses and either long sleeve shirt or sunburn cream. There are very large windows on the train as well as a partially glass roof making it very hard to escape the sun.When we purchased the tickets online you are allocated seating numbers. On both occasions my husband and I were not seated together. There seemed to be quite a few people in similar circumstances and everyone was happy to swap places. The upside to this was that it did quite a good job of breaking the ice and made for a very relaxed train journey chatting with fellow passengers!As part of the cost you are provided with a drink and a light lunch. It was a very pleasant way to try out a few local foods.The only trouble we had was with the baggage. The expectation is that you stay in Cusco, store your large suitcases at the hotel and just carry bags similar in size to plane carry on luggage. However, because we were coming direct from Lima we did not have this option. Our two large suitcases each weighing 20+ kg (plus an assortment of hand held luggage) were definitely frowned upon but not refused.You get dropped off at the train station in Aguas Calientes and will generally be met by someone from your hotel. The majority of the town streets are for foot traffic only so a porter will collect your bags and wheel them to the hotel in a cart. The town is quite small so this is not a long journey. On leaving the station you get to walk through the markets giving you a quick glimpse of some of the merchandise on sale. It is definitely worth coming back for another look."

Prior to our trip,I had many emails with Daniel Calderon of PeruRail (We had to switch trains because we added my children to our trip after I first booked my ticket) . Daniel was very helpful and switched us easily to an alternate train which had space for my entire family.We left from Ollantaytambo which is a great city to visit. The train station there is just off the main street and the ruins of Ollantaytambo. Check in was very easy for our trip and , as they really don't allow a lot of baggage on these trains, we checked our bags at the station and left them there for 2 nights while we were in the Machu Picchu area. Although we were a little concerned about leaving our bags there, we had read many reviews that this was perfectly safe and we had a fine experience with their storage center at Ollantaytambo. When we arrived back in 2 days, we showed our luggage claim tickets and our bags were quickly located.The ride on Perurail to Machu Picchu is beautiful and the service is much like you would receive on an air plane. The attendants on the train serve drinks and sandwiches (included in the ticket price). The Vistadome has windows on the side and ceiling so that you can see the beautiful views all around. On the way back from Machu Picchu we were entertained by \"Representative dances of the Andean Culture\" by a character dressed in brightly colored clothing... I think his name is \"Sacra\" or he is doing the Sacra dance. Also, throughout the trip there is peaceful peruvian flute music playing. It was a very enjoyable trip. One tip, if you can get seats 1 and 2 in the \"A\" car, they spin around once the train starts and now you have a front row seat with a glass window. My two young daughters had these seats on the way back. What a view!"

Then we took the VistaDome on the way back and it was amazing. It was great to be able to see the snow covered mountains easily.

Since the train is the only way to get to Machu Picchu if you do not hike the trail, and Peru Rail was the service that offered trains at the time we wanted--Peru Rail it was (we took the Vistadome). When we visited they were running the \"bi-modal\" service, which involves catching a small shuttle bus from the Cuzco train station, driving to a temporary rail station, and waiting for a train there. My understanding is that this had to do with persistent flooding, but it was something of a pain. The train itself was clean and there were small bathrooms in the car. Service as attentive and drinks and snacks are served at no cost. Be warned that the train moves fairly slow, though the view is enjoyable. On our trip from Machu Picchu to Urabamba, we were subjected to some sort of entertainment from an attendant in costume, followed by a fashion show by another attendant of Peruvian goods for sale, accompanied by loud music. Could have done without that. The train stopped for quite a long time in Ollantaytambo on our return trip. The service was probably overpriced, but nothing that shocked an American used to Amtrak pricing."

Originally we were suppose to take the Vistadome to Machu Picchu and Expedition back but due to a mistake on end for our tickets to Machu Picchu, we had to change to the service to Vistadome on both direction. The change fee did cost us $15 each plus the additional fare. For us, we really enjoyed the Vistadome. From Ollanta, there was only two train cars. Our train departed at 8:10am (Sun) and there was maybe 35 people in both cars. On the return, the Vistadome service maybe had 15 people (6:10pm). The whole second car was empty. Compared to the Expedition, the cars were empty. The Expedition service departed before us and it appeared very popular with tour groups and was full. Same on the return. Also it seems that Peru Rail attaches Expedition cars to their regular domestic cars. For our times, the cost difference between Vistadome and Expedition was about $12 each direction. I thought that price was worth the extra relaxation. I guess seat assignments were also randomly picked. Because the cars are random and attached randomly, nobody seems to know in advance which side you are traveling. The seat numbers cannot be changed. However with an empty car, you can move around and the staff was able to give their advise on which seats provided the best views. We were able to secure seats 1,2 on both direction. Those seats are the first row and provided excellent views, same as the conductor. So essentially you have the front view from the train. For seat 1,2 , be aware the seat back on the seat can be switched to the direction of the train. If you are unable to secure the first or last row, then the left side has the better view to Machu Picchu. In case anyone wonders, the snack going there was a small meat sandwich, cookie and non-alcoholic drink selection. On the way back, same drink service and some spinach roll with desert pastry. The service was great and we definitely go again.Oh I forgot to mention: If you sit towards the rear of the train in the second car, there could be a distinctive smell of diesel fuel. We had to move closer to the middle after one hour sitting in the last row because she was becoming nauseous."

The trains go slow enough that one can enjoy the sprawling greenery and the beautiful views of the mountains and the valleys. They served some snacks which were quite good and the train staff were generally very nice. I would recommend going to Poroy from Cusco by cab and taking the train to Machu Picchu. The views are gorgeous and the ride is so relaxing. The Vistadome that is slightly more expensive has glass roofs as an added advantage.Pros:- Gorgeous views of the mountains and the valley. - Trains have good seating and clean restrooms.- Complimentary snacks provided although it won't suffice for someone who is hungry.- The train staff are warm and welcoming.Cons:- No cons really, but to throw something out there, train moves slow so while the distance isn't much it feels like it's taking forever."

The Vistadome train itself was very comfortable and the large glass expanse allowed for great viewing of the spectacular scenery on the way. A small meal was provided as well. Right now they are providing a bimodal form of transportation with a long, almost two hour, bus ride half of the way there with the Vistadome only providing the final half of the trip. The benefit of this is that the bus departs from the main train station in Cuzco and we could walk to it from our hotel, the JW Marriott. The normal train depot for the Vistadome would be the Poroy Station which is over a 30 minute drive outside of Cuzco so one would have to pay for a long taxi ride to get there. That being said the bus ride was very uncomfortable. The bus was not air conditioned and the roads were horrible with all sorts of construction. Unfortunately we were sitting in the rear of the bus and were severely jostled for most of the bus journey. We couldn't wait to get off that bus."

This excellent hotel has its own train station for the Vistadome, which departs once a day in the morning. The station is less than a 5 minute walk from the hotel and the bellmen carry your bags to the station. There were only 6 of us departing from the hotel. After an hours ride, the train stopped in Ollantaytambo where the rest of the passengers boarded, filling the train to capacity. If you can book seats 1 and 2, you have the added bonus of sitting at the front window of the train, and have views to the side, above and front, offering an unparalleled ride to Agues Calente. The alternative is the Hiram Bingham train which is more luxurious, but extremely expensive. The Vistadome offers better views, simple complementary snacks, and is a much better value. On the way back from Agues Calente, the Vistadome Staff do a silly fashion show of alpaca wool items available for sale, and have recorded music and a local legend jester dancing around the train and engaging the riders to dance in the isle. The best part of the ride is the view along the way, which the Vistadome delivers the best. On the way back to Urubamba, after all of the other passengers got off the train at Ollantaytambo, my companion and I had the train all to ourselves on the last leg of the trip back to Urubamba. The Tambo del Inca bellman was waiting for us at the station to carry our bags back to the hotel."

With the caveat that I used to live in Peru when rail service to Aguas Calientes existed at a fraction of the price...(which, for the record, was nothing fancy but just fine.)The sticker shock of the new train prices was a little hard to swallow. We took the vistadome train to Aguas Calientes. This time of year (wet season), they shut down part of the rail line so we took the \"intermodal\" service --ticket includes a bus leaving from the the train station in Cuzco that you take all the way to the station outside Ollantaytambo where you get on the train. [If you want to take the competing train services this time of year, it's probably a bit cheaper and Inca rail runs a deal with bus line Cruz del Sur that connects to its trains, or you can just spent a night out in the sacred valley.] Vistadome does have lots of windows and a decent view. It was a clean and modern train. We were unfortunately not seated on the side of the train nearest the river, which I wish we had requested. My husband is a nature nut so basically got up to stand elsewhere to take pictures of a few birds and animals along the way. There wasn't much space for him to do this. They also serve a breakfast and a return snack on the Vistadome (included in ticket)--not amazing but if you are hungry with the early departure, it's a welcome addition. For the money, it'd be nice if they also had a snack on the bus ride and didn't charge ridiculous amounts of money for coffee/tea at the train station where you have to wait between the bus ride and boarding the train. A day trip to MP is about a 12 hour endeavor.On the way back from Aguas Calientes, they did this stupid song/dance/style show thing on thr train where they made Peru Rail employees model various types of Alpaca clothing--scarves, coats, etc. We were all exhausted and would have appreciated peace and quiet to nap vs another sales pitch, especially considering how expensive the train ticket was. (And they were pressuring the nice couple next to us to buy something, outrageous!)And no folks--this expensive train ticket isn't doing much of anything to support Machu Picchu. Peru rail is privately owned these days so we're just lining someone's pockets (I believe Orient Express Hotels Ltd. to be exact--also the owner of El Monestario in Cuzco and a bunch of other fancy hotels worldwide.)In short, the train was just fine, but very expensive. The competition is slightly cheaper but not a whole lot either. I'd appreciate cutting the sales pitch, especially considering the ticket price."

Make sure you sit on the left side of the train on the way up and on the right side of the train on the return trip. The views are exciting along the river. This river has class four or five rapids almost all the time we were on the train. Due to the narrow guage tracks the train ran rather slow which was fine because you could enjoy the Andes Mountains as were traveled up the Sacred Valley. We were exposed to very impressive eye opening and brain teasing views during the hour and a half train ride. The dome windows were an asset because we could comfortably see the high towering mountains that we were traveling through. The Andes dancing troupe on the return trip was almost worth the cost of a train ticket. Their fashion show and dancing was awesome."

I wish I had purchased tickets on the Expedition train instead to save money. :(To add insult to injury, on the return trip not only were we not in seats facing one another as shown in the pictures (though they did exist in the car), I had to sit in a row separate from my kids! One of two major disappointments during our Machu Picchu trip. As the person funding this trip on a small budget, the expense of the \"Vistadome\" train really bothered me. The kids still had fun."

Just before I was to fly to Cusco and take the train to Aquas Calientes, that is the town at the base of Machu Pichu, I got an e-mail from Peru Rail, that we would have to be taking the train at another station. In order to get to that station I had to take a bus from the outskirts of Cusco and travel an hour to catch the train. I later discovered that they had actually thought of canceling the trip. It looks like they had had some landslides and some of the passes were blocked. So we took a taxi from Cusco Plaza to the bus meeting point, then meandered through many little villages to get to the Train Connection. Once on the train we were in luxury with food and drinks and enjoyable conversation with passengers, on the way to Aguas Calientes. The trip took longer than planned, but they got us there! I am impressed with \"Peru Rail\". By the way, at the Lima Airport there is a \"Peru Rail\" office. If you have questions about your ticket and times, better to ask them there. They also have a great map of the area."

We were certainly amazed by the views of the mountains from the train . The food is nothing crazy and a little small, but it's local, and if you ask they will explain what it is in it and you will understand why it is being served... all Andean ingredients. The ushers were really accommodating... our friend and us were sitting in different cars and they accommodated us to be sitting next to each other both ways. The attendants on the train were fun and responded all of our questions. Ambar Moscoso, Carlos Ramirez and Rogers Miranda entertained us with dances and music, and then a \"fashion like show\". At the end of the show they offered alpaca items... it's entertaining considering it's pitch dark outside, and you are stuck in the train. I am really sad that the train doesn't go all the way up to Cusco... the zigzag of the lines was very original. I am also kind of upset at the inefficiency of the travel agencies to coordinate the minimum amount of buses to go back to Cusco.... some of the buses and minibuses carry 2-3 people which is a waste of resources and definitely an increase carbon footprint."

You'll need your passport and ticket to board the train. The Vistadome offers wide windows (including some on the ceiling) and plays interesting music the entire trip (including some catchy Andean flute songs that get progressively more like EDM as you get closer to Machu Picchu).A decent-sized meal is served on the train, and you'll pass through dozens of little towns, picturesque moments, and incredible views and before you know it you'll arrive in Aguas Calientes.

The same procedures were employed on the return trip to Cuzco. The explanation given was that the rainy season affected the train's course, however in july there is no rainy season. The train fare is high, so one would expect premier service to and fro. Apparently there is a glitch which has not been repaired and is inexplicable.

The modelling of the clothes by the staff was very entertaining. On both trips there were a lot of unhappy customers with regard to the seating & staff had their hands full trying to organise alternative seating arrangements.

Vistadome is nice with the large windows and I believe upgraded service, but with few exceptions you will be staring across a small table at the people in the seats in front of you. If you're friendly (or family), that's great. Otherwise the 3.5 hour ride could be a bit annoying. You'll also be playing footsies. Next time we might take the regular cars (all seats facing the same way) instead. Also - the big Vistadome windows aren't much value if you take the last train back from MP in the dark."

The ride from Machu Pichhu to Cusco was terrible. It was a newer train, so the windows were bigger, but it was dark out so that didn't matter. The train was really unstable though so it made me incredibly car sick. It was an awful 3 hour ride. Awful. The \"entertainment\" was also bizarre and not that enjoyable.

We were certainly pampered with food and drink at the beginning of the trip. On the way back, there was a masked Peruvian dancer and a fashion show. Crazy but interesting. My only issue is with booking of the tickets. It seemed everyone on the train had to switch seats, because despite buying their tickets together like my husband and I, no one was seated together. It was frustrating. On the way back my husband and I were seated on different cars! We had to wait until everyone was seated before we could get seats not together on the same car.

We never did and this hich meant that we were stuck in Aguas Caliente. Sra Analy was really helpful and tried to call our Hotel to inform them that we had arrived. Unfortunately she could not get through to them so she then helped us to get a bus to the hotel. While were with her we mentioned that me and my partner were getting married at Machu Piccu. Sra Analy was working on our train on the way back and remembered that we had gotten married and presented my wife and I with a present of Strawberries in Caramel, it made a once in a lifetime experience that little bit more special.

This experience even surpassed the evacuation from a labor strike in Puno that we experienced 2 days later. The train ride (at 17MPH) is an overwhelming 3 hours and 40 minutes. If that was not enough, we were delayed 2 additional hours after our train hit a bus about 30 minutes into the trip. We were given absolutely no information until a Peruvian Tour Guide kicked up a fuss. One of the porters advised that we had hit a bus, the driver had been removed by the police, and the driver was on the way to have his blood alcohol tested. He never made it back. I will let you all figure out why. After about 90 minutes it occurred to Peru Rail that maybe the driver was not coming back and they finally sent a new driver. As a result, we missed the English speaking guide and had a whopping 2 hours at Machu Picchu. We were told that we would get an extra hour (delaying the return train and hour) and then Peru Rail just took the extra hour away with no explanation, no apology. To add insult to injury, the Peru Rail staff was very rude and openly hostile to Americans. They would pretend not to speak English when you asked them a question and then you would hear them speaking English to the German and French tour groups. They ignored us when they took orders for food and drinks asking everyone else at our table what they wanted. They also seemed more interested in selling us CD\u2019s and clothes than making our journey an enjoyable one. The CD was of the ANNOYING music played for the almost 6 hours we were stuck on the train. Machu Picchu was the reason we picked Peru and we spent a great deal of money to get there. We felt cheated by only having 2 hours to look around."

The seats are very comfortable, the food a little minimal but good and the journey a delight. The double seats not facing others give you much more leg room and a little more privacy.

The seats are comfortable, the windows are huge, the staff are wonderful. The service is great, they come around with snacks, drinks, and even put on a fashion show rather than just walking up and down the aisle offering to sell beautiful alpaca clothes. Granted they are expensive, but it's a fun distraction. The views are really great from the cabins, you go through mountains, valleys, past streams, woods. In addition to huge windows on the side of the car, they also have windows on top so you can get some really nice views. The staff went out of their way to help us. All in all, highly recommended way to get to Machu Picchu."

Yes ok, I am in full agreement with other posters here that this train is spotless and newish, the service polite and the food OK (but yes, also unexpected). However, this is a long 3.5 hour trip. If you're in a group or you're a gregarious extrovert that might sound like heaven, but seating that arranges two people facing two others can pit you against some people you'd ordinarily never spend such time with. I was lucky enough to have an older English gentleman opposite me who kicked me under the shared table numerous times shortly after we left Poroy. I assumed it was by accident but when I returned from the toilet I found he'd moved my backpack (very small and tucked under my seat) and was slouched in his seat with his legs stretched under mine. He reluctantly moved them as I sat down and told me to please put my pack on my lap. I asked why as I couldn't see how it bothered him and he said it did as he wanted to stretch his legs out. Now I won't go on but he tried the whole trip to get his legs under our seat any way he could. I'm 5'10\" and I could easily fit in my allotted seat with my feet not encroaching on anyone but I agree it was tight. So my advice is try to book the very rare two seats facing the backs of the seats in front if you can. There are only four per cabin and we negotiated a swap in the return leg for seats 39/40. Gold. Secondly the ceiling windows let in a lot of sun and the air con can be slow to respond. Window seaters will be hot. Finally the scenery is boring. It's farms and modified landscapes until you're about 30 minutes from MP Pueblo so don't get too excited about great views. Take a book. Any rail trip in Japan offers more at a cheaper price. Of course my attitude us coloured by the fact that our train hit a bus at an unsecured level crossing and we had a 2 hour delay making it a 5.5 hour trip. On our return it rained and my window leaked all over my seat and everyone's windows were fogged up. Again, great vistas!! When you include the unbearable 'fashion show' and accompanying nightclub music this is hardly a trip I'd advocate to anyone, but you have to get to Machu Picchu somehow."

We spent most of our time looking out the window (the view is wonderful= and talking to our seatmates. The next day we took the 5:30 pm train back, and it was a memorable journey. We had a wonderful team comprised of Milagre Cheques Ffifo (not sure how to spell it), Esteban Pimentel and Erick Leone. They gave us a light snack, and then there was surprise entertainment of someone dressed in a traditional character costume dancing in the aisles. After that there was a brief fashion show with some lovely items that I wish I was able to buy, but I can`t wear any type of wool, even alpaca. In addition to being talented, the staff is very warm, helpful and accomodating. Both of our 90 minute journeys were very enjoyable.

The staff was very polite and professional, greeting us in the early morning chill dressed in smart dark blue trench coats. We were served a substantial snack on linen runners as we enjoyed the spectacular views of farms, Incan ruins, aspects of the Inca Trail and snow-covered mountains from our clean, modern Vistadome car. A voice-over in English would occasionally interupt the quiet background music and point out important sites along the way. On trip back to Poroy/Cusco, there was a repeat of the same impeccable service by Horem, Sixto, and Gibers, including a surprise \"show\". One of them dressed in a colorful, Carnival-like costume and mask and performed a native dance, pulling a couple of the female passengers to dance with him. It was charming. This was followed by a fashion show of lovely (and VERY reasonably priced for the quality) items made from baby alpaca. I found the softest scarves for $30 that would cost more than $100 in a Stateside department store. One reviewer that it was strange to \"peddle\" goods on the train, but what I think he/she missed was the pride the local population (and all Peruvians) have for their culture, and this includes sharing their music, food and handicraft traditions with visitors. The only hiccup was a clogged toilet, but the capable staff quickly fixed the problem. I wholeheartedly encourage traveling by Vistadome train to Machu Picchu."

The service was excellent, and the views were gorgeous. The train never goes too fast, but rather makes it way at a lazy pace through the mountains passing tiny villages and popping in and out of tunnels along the way. We thoroughly enjoyed our experience until the trains went on strike the day we were supposed to return. I'm not sure how frequently this happens, but they halted all trains in and out of the city for the day. Around 3-4 in the afternoon all of the tourists began to congregate at the tiny train station for \"updates\". They seemed to handle the situation in as orderly as fashion as they could, and understood that many of the tourists needed to leave AC that evening for fear of missing connecting flights out of Cuzco that day. I feel terrible for any of the people who had booked day trips via the train into AC that day to see Machu Picchu, as they most certainly were cheated out of their experience. But hey, in the developing world one must realize that you're at the beckon call of the transportation systems. After a relatively stressful afternoon of uncertainty, they sent several trains to pick up all of the tourists later that evening and managed to just barley avoid an angry mob. We departed AC around 8pm that evening and arrived in Cuzco around midnight. It would behoove you to allot two full days to Machu Picchu just in case there is a freak train strike so that you can ensure you'll get to visit the gem of Peru!"

It's a newer train, very clean with fantastic service, and also with a surprisingly good breakfast and dinner. The train has windows cut into the roof, which is key to appreciating the spectacular scenery that you go through, particularly because the track gets quite narrow at times and you wouldn't see much if you couldn't look up through the roof.The train leaves from the outskirts of Cusco (Poroy) or Ollanta (2 hours from Cusco), although the Poroy station is closed during the rainy season (Dec - Feb) and you have to bus the first part. Getting to Aguas Calientes, you take a 20 minute bus ride up the mountain. Buses leave every 5 minutes and tickets can be bought onsite for $18. Machu Pichu entrance tickets can also be bought at the Ministry of Culture (very close to the train and bus stations) for about $40.You can buy all of this as a package or do it yourself. We did it ourselves and saved between $100-$150 pp by doing so. The only thing that has limited space and must be booked in advance is the train. Be warned, you need to bring your passport to get on the train and to get into Machu Pichu. You cannot use another person's ticket. Also, trains leave right on time, so be there a half hour early as they suggest."

On the day I boarded I found it a bit strange, it was not like in the pictures, anyway, had Machu Pichu ahead. Few days later in Cuzco I went to a Peru Rail office, pointed to the pictures all over and explained that I might have boarded on EXPEDITION train instead, I had pictures to show. They kindly recommended me to write a mail with detailed information to PeruRail, what else could they do? I did send the email on Sep 5th, clear pictures showing what VISTADOME and EXPEDITION are in their website, my picture and I clearly boarded EXPEDITION paying the price of the first.Not surprisingly there was not reply to my message.I did wait a good time for this reply, the cash difference is small, but details like this just shows how some people in the company treat their customers."

The views are nice though you don't get to see a lot more through the top windows (which we had in the expedition train as well anyway). One thing, be VERY careful with the tables, don't put anything on the folding part as it is inclined and it might fall. I had the hot coffee spil on my lap (and consequently had a wet butt all the way to MP!). And a few minutes later I saved my neighbor from the same fate.

We took the VistaDome twice on our holiday this year, once from Cusco to Machu Picchu and the next journey from Machu Picchu to Ollyantaytambo.First, let me say that we booked online and so were a little disappointed that we were seated apart from each other in groups of four, two facing two. We were lucky to have found someone to change with, but clearly they didn't get a good deal out of it besides being able to sit together. We were happy to be sitting on the left side of the train, for the most part out of the sun coming in the right side windows. We had incredible views of the valley and the river and they on the other side had great views of the mountains, The seating looked a little better on the Perurail Explorer with more seats facing in the direction of travel and less facing each other. The Explorer also left a half hour before the VistaDome and I believe is cheaper.We really enjoyed the trip back from Machu Picchu getting seats together on the front of the train sitting facing the front window and so were able to video tape the journey up and out of the valley. We got some great views of the journey, we have since posted to YouTube.The service was great, they looked after us very well for the short hour and a half trip to Ollyantaytambo.They do have a limit to the amount of luggage being brought onboard, which is another inconvenience if you are going for a couple of says. Many still had large suite cases and so it's hard to know how the rules are enforced or applied.Clearly the whole visit to Machu Picchu is a big ticket item for anyone and so having this very well run service to make the whole experience amazing is just a part of what it takes to have made this one of the Best Wonders of the World experiences in the world.."

The service was both friendly, efficient and polite. The native dancer on the return trip was interesting for a while but the same movements and gestures over and over got old fast. The fashion show on the return trip was interesting for the many, varied ways demonstrated to wear the same beautiful garments.

Requests to turn the music down were ignored. All they were interested in was making sales.We were tipped off the train before our destination, which would have been a relief except we were then bussed back to Cuzco, took over 2 hours in the traffic.You can hike up and avoid the train, but I don't think you are allowed to hike back.

Had I known, I would have dressed warmer, but I was traveling to a warm place, on a train that I assumed was heated based on the price. We asked for blankets, which were being distributed, but were told they were only for children. Aside from the cold, the train was great! The views were wonderful. The food was nice, too, although the food that should have been warm (pancakes in the morning and pizza at night) was freezing cold like the rest of the train. At night, it was crazy. They do an alpaca fashion show. It was entertaining, but a little irritating since I had been sleeping, and I didn't actually want to buy their alpaca wear afterwards and they were rather pushy."

Once on the train it was totally relaxing. There were views all around, even through the glass roof of the train. There was an enjoyable light breakfast served which just kept us going for a busy morning. The train travels slowly and steadily which enables you to fully take in the views of the mountains, Urubamba River and some fantastic vegetation, such as Bromeliads growing on tree trunks.The outward journey had a lot of Machu Picchu merchandise being pushed by the train staff, but as long as you were clear that you were not interested they immediately moved on.The return journey was fun with a scary Peruvian monster appearing out of nowhere. The train staff then put on an enjoyable \"catwalk\" fashion show. The female staff seemed to be enjoying dressing up and parading around. The one male member of staff clearly felt rather awkward about the whole idea. The alpaca fashion items were well designed but very expensive. It did get our eye in a bit when we did our own shopping for alpaca goods later on in a more conventional store.It is important to note that there is very little luggage space on the train. We could only take on our overnight bags and our main luggage had to taken separately to our next destination."

I and my school friend are on 2 week trip visiting Lima, Cusco, Machu Picchu, Foz do iguazu and Rio. We had a very tight schedule and missing any one leg could have unravelled the trip. That is what I feared would happen when we arrived 2 minutes late (scheduled departure of 13:27) at Ollantaytambo station for our Perurail Vistadome train to Machu Picchu on 7th Aug. However the staff at the Perurail ticket booth contacted the Perurail manager Mr Alfredo who was a star of the day and perhaps of the trip for us. He understood our situation, told us to wait at the waiting room on the platform and that he would check on availability of seats on the 15:30 hrs train; which he promptly did and we were able to reach Agua Calientes and visit Machu Picchu on the 8th Aug as scheduled. The staff also advised us to leave our heavy bags at the 'Left Baggage' at the station which saved us from lugging it around. Kudos to Mr Alfredo and his team at Perurail in Ollataytambo- Great job and thanks a lot."

MachuPicchu shouldn't be missed, but unfortunately you will have to take either PeruRail or InkaRail to get there or back.We took PeruRail round-trip Ollantaytambo to Aguas Calientes, staying overnight in Aguas Calientes. We generally agree with the recent comments. The cost is too high, and the \u201cVISTA\u201d dome is over-hyped. We expected a glass dome train, like those on TransCanada\u2026.but found essentially elongated windows with very limited view. In retrospect, if not for the schedule we wanted to keep, I would have chosen the cheaper train. The people selling tickets both in Cusco and Ollantaytambo apparently have never ridden on one of their own trains, as they couldn\u2019t answer basic questions about seating. Just so you know, seats are assigned automatically when purchased, and from what we could tell, passengers riding together, more often than not, are assigned seats that are not adjacent to one another, or even in the same row. Our seats were not together on either leg of the trip. Staff is unable to even tell you where your seats are based on your seat numbers (really?)\u2026.but here\u2019s a hint: If you seat number is \u201codd\u201d\u2026.it\u2019s a window seat. We were both assigned window seats on both trips, but on opposite sides of the train, on different rows. Meanwhile, every PeruRail representative we spoke with assured us that our seats were adjacent. We are both fluent in Spanish\u2026and there was no language issues here\u2026.just a lack of knowledge by the people selling the tickets. Let me emphasize that, despite being an \u201cOrient Express\u201d owned company, don\u2019t expect the high level of service you get in North America or Europe. The people we dealt with were clueless, borderline incompetent.Here\u2019s another hint. PeruRail staff won\u2019t help you rearrange your seating on the train when you get on board\u2026that is up to you. It really helps to be multi-lingual, because with luck you can work with the other people in your general area that also aren\u2019t sitting together to switch seats so that you can sit with your own family or friends.Another hint: If you sit on the right side going towards Aguas Calientes or left side headed to Ollantaytambo, you won\u2019t see much. The view is really only on the \u201criver\u201d side of the train.About PeruRail\u2019s wonderful luggage policy, which is clearly posted on all materials and is stated to be very strict, with no exceptions\u2026.you are LIMITED to only 1 bag on board the train, with a TOTAL WEIGHT OF ONLY\u2026.11 POUNDS! If you have more luggage\u2026.it can be shipped to Aguas Calientes on a train that travels once per day, which most likely won\u2019t work for your schedule. We questioned the ticket agent, and of course she said there were no exceptions. OK, here\u2019s the tip\u2026.although we saw most people actually abiding by this policy (we foolishly did)\u2026.there were a number of travelers taking large and heavy luggage, with no problem. NO ON from PeruRail questioned the luggage these people took on the train. Of course, like most places in Peru, if you have a ticket on the train, you can check your luggage for free at the station in Ollantaytambo, which is what we did, picking it up when we returned the following day.The food is ridiculous. Dry, inedible sandwiches on both trips. Beverage is supposedly included. When I asked what I could choose from, I was told anything offered. Ready for this? I asked for a beer, and was told that wasn't included. Really? Everyone around me laughed and rolled their eyes at the irony.The negative comments in the other reviews about not knowing there was a transfer to a bus from Pachar to Cusco\u2026.that is unfair, and only shows that they didn\u2019t do their homework. The train hasn\u2019t left from Poroy (Cusco) for several years, due to damage to the tracks and bridge from El Nino flooding. That information is available in English and Spanish. Our assessment was that it was much easier to hire a driver to Ollantaytambo and catch the train there rather than from Cusco\u2026especially if you are intending to overnight in Aguas Calientes. If you are doing a day trip to MachuPicchu from Cusco (in that case, god help you, expect a very long, hard day), you don\u2019t have much choice due to scheduling of trains, so good luck with that."

On the way to AC I sat on the mountain viewing side and on the way back to O I sat on the river viewing side. The train to AC had a configuration of 4 seats facing each other with a wooden table between us. We were served a very nice snack of fruit, pancakes, etc. The train has a partial see thru top so you can really see the glaciers and mountains while relaxing. On the way from AC the views of the rapids of the river are breathtaking. Both sides offer wonderful views o the surrounding mountains. The station in O was clean and quite spacious, the station in AC was clean and our hotel was within easy walking distance, as is the bus to Machu Picchu. There are many restaurants and shopping nearby. The train I took from AC also offered entertainment in the form of a guy dressed rather garishly and jumping around to traditional Peruvian music, quite funny. We were also given a fashion show and were able to purchase the items being worn by the models although they were quite expensive. The snack from AC was similar to the one we received on our way there. We did not take the train from or to Cusco because our guide advised that it would add more than an hour to our trip, we were taken by bus from our hotel to the Ollantaytambo station and when we came back to that station we were taken by bus to our hotel in Cusco. The bathrooms in both trains were clean."

Of course you want to experience the whole thing, there's only one MP and it is magnificent, but you can't help thinking that that you're being taken advantage of. Hope they don't kill the golden goose, such as with the Puno-Cusco train which now costs about $300, forcing most tourists to travel by bus. However it is very well organised and it runs on time. Bear in mind that you are only allowed hand luggage, but some bring the whole caboodle and it's juts a matter of chance which type pf train you get and whether there is sufficient storage space. On our return trip they just stacked it all up against the emergency exit so no problem space wise."

The girl we were dealing with was short tempered, rude and very unhelpful. My bank changed the card I purchased our tickets with just before leaving our home country which meant I couldn't provide her with the last four digits. In her defense their paper work does state that you need this, however we had three other cards with the same name, passport, international driver permit, home country drivers lic for ID. She was 100% unwilling to budge despite me clearly being the correct person. Some may call it fraud protection, but for a domestic 4 hr train I call it belligerent. I had to phone international just to get the last four digits of this old card - as if that's got anything to do with ID checking next to the several other forms we had there I mentioned.The train itself may have windows in the roof but lets be honest, what is seen through the roof 95% of the time - that's right, the sky. This is the only difference between expedition and vistadome trains structurally. The food was a major let down. We received one plate with (seriously) about ten peanuts, three slices of cheese, a few raisins, some tomato with a drink of water/soft drink/juice etc. no further food was available. Also, beer or wine were not available. Then the fashion show. They dress up their staff in different alpaca tops and parade them down the aisle for about 20-25 mins as a \"fashion show\". It was funny, as intended, but you can't miss the real reason for having this show - which is to fleece the customers further with those extra things they failed to purchase while on their wonderful holiday. Very very tacky, and prices of these items are, of course, highly inflated. After the show you can forget about getting any assistance from the staff (not that they can give you anything other than coke or juice anyway) as they are tied up with transactions of alpaca tops for quite some time.Is a four hour trip total macchu piccu to cusco, the last 1.5 hrs of this were spent on a bus. This is unavoidable due to track maintenance after the wet season. All in all yes it's a reliable service, but don't swallow all the \"luxury\" statements so easily. Vistadome is heavily advertised as luxurious but it sure as hell isn't. Peru Rail is also foreign owned, not by Peruvians. Try Inka Rail."

Earlier this month, we boarded the Vistadome in Aguas Calientes, having had a wonderful time, the previous 10 days in Cusco and on a 6 day trek through the Salkantay pass to the Inca Trail to Machu Picchu. The ticket we bought was for the destination Poroy, right outside of Cusco. After an hour and a half, without warning, the train stopped and we were all made to disembark in Pachar, and board buses for an uncomfortable two hour ride (without toilets) on buses to Cusco. The conductors did not even attempt to give us an explanation (though my grown daughter asked, in fluent Spanish). On the bus we heard a canned announcement that it was \"for our safety\" (No live human being talked to us the entire time). When I asked a Perurail official, taking down our passport numbers (the fourth time this happened on the trip) he said it was because it was \"the rainy season in Cusco\". But it is the dry season there!. Finally, a fellow trekker on the bus told us that they were working on rails outside Cusco, so that we couldn't take the train the whole way there. It would have been nice for them to tell us that, before we had the tickets, before, or during the train ride! Even before the sudden departure from the train, that lengthened the trip by well over an hour, this expensive trip was a disappointment. The snack was peanuts and raisins spilled over a tray; just hope you're not allergic to peanuts!. After a traditional dancer mugs for photos with travelers, and a little fashion show is given, the majority of the trip was spent trying to sell these overpriced alpaca textiles to the American tourists who fill the trains. Instead of getting to relax and enjoy the views, we had conductors turned peddlers pushing their wares in our faces the whole trip. They were so busy that I couldn't even get them to bring the change on a beer I bought for over an hour, and then he said I would have to accept dollars because he had \"run out\" of soles. Not surprisingly, Perurail did not give me the courtesy of a reply to the email I sent them when I got home.  The goal of Perurail seems to be to extract as much money from rich Americans as possible.  If you possibly can: trek to Machu Picchu, and take any alternative to Perurail, and their Vistadome back to Cusco. Right now, the only alternative seems to be Inca Rail. By all means, go with that company instead."

After having a wonderful experience in Cusco, on the Salkantay- Inca Trail trek, in Machu Picchu, and in Aguas Calientes, it was sad to end our vacation with these swindlers. We bought tickets for the Vistadome, from Aguas Clientes to Poroy, outside of Cusco. After an hour and half, the train stopped suddenly, and we were made to disembark in Pachar, and board buses, for an uncomfortable two hour bus ride (without toilets) to Cusco. When we asked the conductors (in fluent Spanish) what was going on, they said things like \"Poroy is Pachar\" and \"Poroy, no that is Cusco\". They clearly did not want to be bothered. The canned message on the bus said we were being taken on buses (adding an hour and a half to the trip we had paid $75/seat for) \"for our safety\". No live human being talked to us the entire trip. A Perurail official on the bus, checking our passport for the fourth time during this trip, would only say we were made to complete the trip on a bus \"because it's the rainy season in Cusco\" But it is the dry season in Cusco! We finally learned, from another trekker on the bus, that the company was working on the rails outside Cusco. It would have been nice of Perurail to tell us this, before, or during the trip! Even before this turn of events, the trip was a disappointment. The snack we were served was a pile of peanuts thrown on a plate. As one who is allergic to peanuts, I'm grateful that at least the airlines leave them in their bags. The native dancer on the conductors giving a fashion show in alpaca shawls and sweaters was cute, but that soon ended, to be followed by an hour of t them coming down the aisle trying to sell these overpriced textiles to passengers. They were so involved with this sales job, that the guy who sold me a beer couldn't be bothered to bring me change, and, after an hour, when I finally got him to do that, he said he only had dollars, not soles. I don't know how many other tourists saw the irony of our passing desperately poor Andean villagers only yards away at times, while tourists, peered up from their Iphones and videogames to buy $300 sweaters and shawls.  When I got home, I emailed the company about our experience. Not surprisingly, they did not give me the courtesy of a reply.  It contrast to all the friendly folks we in Peru, on the streets, in restaurants, hotels, and on the trail, it seems that the main goal of this company is to cynically extract as much money as possible from wealthy Americans. Unfortunately, Perurail has a virtual monopoly on any transport to and from Machu Picchu, unless you walk. However, there is an alternative: Inca Rail. I suggest that you do anything possible to keep from giving your money to these crooks."

I would stick with choosing the best train for your \"schedule\" and not make your decision based on Expedition or Vistadome. Why? Because the actual train is the same between the Expedition and the Vistadome. Same scenic windows, same seats, legroom, etc. We rode one of each during our roundtrip from Cusco to MP. In our experience, the only difference was they offered a different \"snack\" (neither of which was anything to get excited about) and the Vistadome included a modeling show with loud music, which we would have preferred to skip. The scenery is enough of an attraction, but they want to model some local clothing in the hopes people want to buy something. Unless the Vistadome's times work better for you, just book the Expedition. Certainly a more calming ride!"

Apparently, we looked like confused tourists because we were greeted by Alfredo at the station. He was most helpful and took our bags and walked us through the process of getting our train tickets. Upon check-in, he noticed that we were given backward-facing seats on the train. He rode with our group to the Pachar station. He was quick to answer any questions that the passengers had, and also was bilingual. The whole process was very easy because of his assistance. We are not fluent in Spanish and it could have been quite cumbersome. Alfredo is a wonderful, professional station manager. We enjoyed the train ride because our seats were upgraded and the scenery was breath-taking. The trains were riding pretty much according to schedule, but we were on vacation so there really wasn't any issue if it had not been.

Whilst it would have been nice to do the full train ride I'd rather stay safe and travel part of the journey by bus. The replacement bus is only meant to be until 21st July 2013 so shouldn't affect travellers after that date. We found the train seats comfortable and the food was really good. We had fresh pancakes, strawberries, melon and spinach quiche. We had a choice of hot and cold drinks also. The scenery was spectacular and well worth travelling by train. The glass ceiling really added to the experience as you could see the tops of the mountains all down the length of the train. The staff were really friendly and when they came around with a \"duty free\" style trolley selling Peru rail gifts they were up for a laugh letting passengers try on the Indiana jones style waist coats and hats for photos. There wasn't a hard sell at all, just letting passengers try on the hats. A thoroughly memorable experience! :-)"

I was rather surprised when the trained stopped with no announcement and we were offloaded onto busses for the remaining hour and a half of our trip. The train (apart from the legroom) was quite comfortable. The Bus on the other hand was not anywhere near as comfortable. I don't think that they should charge a premium price for the travel when the bus is clearly nowhere near the same standard. I would check on whether the rail line has been repaired before paying for the Ollantaytambo - Cusco part."

When we arrived in Peru, we went to a Peru Rail station in Ollantaytambo to pick up our actual tickets two days before. We had made reservations on line previously.

Try Inca Rail you may be luckier....follows details of my experience:- The ride itself was OK, good on-board service, very clean , comfortable seats, on time- Took the VistaDome on the way down to Machu Picchu, came back with their Expedition service.-Both cars had windows in the roof...vistadome are newer cars and all seats are facing forward, you get a sandwich....other than this Expedition is very similar (last seats at the front and back face the opposite way)The bad service:- When booking online you don't even get an email with what you just bought, just a reference number ( so unless youremember you do not have an idea of what dates and times or type of service you just bought)- They still ask you to claim the tickets in person at a ticket desk at the airport or in Cusco.- They ask you to bring the credit card used for the purchase with you...so if someone else is buying you the ticket, or forget to bring the creditmcard, etc you have NO WAY of getting your tickets unless someone faxes/emails you a copy of the credit card....the othe company probably does the same but this is an absolute waste of time and a great unneficiency. Technology allows today many ways to inimize the risk of credit card cloning without affecting the experience of all the users- Waited 1 hour ( together with 7 other people ) at their Lima airport ticketing office ... ( supposedly 24h service) no one ever showd up. Even called their Cusco office for help to locate the individual but nothing happened-At their ticket office in Cusco, because we did ot have ourmcreditmcards...they allowed us to claim our train tickets (following an unpleasant discussion with the attendant) by allowing us to just give them the credit card information to claim our tickets- The person at the ticketing office DID NOT CARE about giving my wyfe and I seats together ...so we had to have another unpleasant discussion when boarding the train in Ollantaytambo in order to get us seated together.- They only allow us to bring one small backpack per person...if you do otherwise will get in trouble"

Very full train, nonetheless and nice to have a snack meal both directions of travel. There was a very loud fashion show along the hallways of the train on the return passage, not possibly for everyone after a tiring day in Machu Picchu. Good experience overall"

The seats were comfortable, but I didn't think the 'snack' was worth it. During the trip up, they brought a little cart to sell books and clothing items and a passenger across from us took a LOT of time talking to them and asking for different sizing in the clothes and so they were standing next to me for about 20 minutes, which interrupted my view and enjoyment of the trip. On the way back, they had a fashion show and a dancer, which was fun. I didn't want to pay for the Hiram Bingham train, but I wonder if the Expedition would have worked just as well for a smaller price. I was also disappointed that we had to transfer to a bus from Pachar to Cusco due to part of the rail being damaged. Our bus driver was super aggressive in his driving, which was stressful.

It had very comfortable seats with plenty of leg room. They were on time (or very close to it). The only reason that I do not give them 5 \"stars\" in my review is due to how hard it is to book the tickets in advance (which you have to do) from outside of Peru, or at least from the US. If anyone is reading this from Perurail, please get together with whoever sells the Machu Picchu passes and the bus tickets and put together a jumbo ticket good for all three. And make sure that you figure out how to sell these to people planning their trips while in another country. Even if we COULD get tickets after arriving in Peru, we don't want to spend our precious travel time doing that. I finally called the call center in Peru and managed to get tickets, but had to photocopy my drivers license and credit card and email the copy. Not a wise thing to do - but I went ahead and did it in order to get the tickets. I changed the credit card number as soon as I got back. Also - passengers, note that you can only take 5 kilos (11 lbs) with you in your bag. You won't need more than that, but you will have to make plans to have your big suitcases secured someplace until you get back from Aguas Calientes. They give you a nice snack (little sandwich or something) on board the train, by the way. So if you are running short on time, you won't starve."

Now this is really important: When you embark the train at Ollantaytambo you can only take a small carry on and I mean small! They will not allow you to get on board the train with suitcases or anything that is larger than your average carry on to get on to a plane. So what to do with your suit cases then? In Ollantaytambo we stayed at Hotel Tika Wasi Valley. Our small tour group left our suitcases at this hotel whilst we travelled on to Aguas Calientes. After we saw Macchu Picchu we travelled back to Hotel Tika Wasi Valley, picked them up and went on our way back to Cuzco. When you get off the train in Aguas Calientes you have to take your small baggage down the steps at the train station. There are vendors right on the train tracks!"

(english & spanish) We had been advised that large suitcases were not accepted on board, so decided that an overnight bag was adequate for a 2 day visit. It was amazing the size of the luggage some passengers managed to take on board with them As mentioned by other travellers, we were not seated together, as was nearly everyone else on the train. This was soon sorted out in the first 5 minutes and all part of the experience. On the way back I was seated amongst a large family from Belgium who treated me as one of their own and kept us entertained with their bargaining experience with the stewardess.My sister ended up seated in an aisle seat with people she didn't know. This was a shame for her as she was so excited and would have loved to see more out of the window. Instead, the woman in the window seat proceeded to read a book all the way home. Unbelievable!At the time of the booking we were unaware of problems with landslides. However the connecting buses were well co-ordinated. (Our bus driver was intent on overtaking on hairpin bends, but with much haggling from all passengers, he was then content to take his time and entertain us with 80's music at 100 decibels all the way back to Cusco). This is no reflection on the train service, just part of travelling in Peru.I would recommend this service to anyone. The little stories just make travel interesting."

However, that seems to be the only thing that you are paying extra for. The ride to Aguas Calientes was ok except for the Andean music playing overhead at an irritatingly loud volume. I almost had to yell to talk to people right next to me. It would have been just fine if it was \"background\" music, but it wasn't. Then I realized why the music was blasting when the attendants came around with a cart of stuff to try to sell us, including the CD they had been playing. Then came the ride back, where we remained boarded on the train, in the station for almost 2 hours before moving. Other trains came and left. There was an issue with our train, but I would think that we could have been transferred to another train to get on with our vacation. Nobody ever told us what the delay was about or offered anything for our wasted time. By the time we finally got going it was almost dark, so I couldn't see anything out of the windows anyhow. The lights inside remained on so there was too much glare to see anything during sunset. We then got to watch a \"fashion show\" with more loud music. This was also so that the attendents could try to sell us more stuff. This train would be much nicer without being solicited while trying to enjoy your ride.

No room for suitcases so only take essential items and forward the rest of your gear to your return hotel.....unless you are going for more than 2 days, etc....then take a big bag. The train porters will let you board with a big suitcase. I saw many doing so even though the tickets says 5 kg max. The porters won't give you a hard time but just know that once you get to AC you need to be able to manage your suitcase on your own. We downsized and kept our essentials in our backpacks then went to our AC hotel before we visited MP; therefore avoiding lugging suitcases around AC. I think this is good advice that you should try to follow if practical. AC is hilly with cobbled streets, busy marketplaces etc. It's a walking town but it could turn into a big PIA if you are lugging a suitcase around....(my opinion). The train was nice as I mentioned before. Nice views, etc. However we had booked a return ticket to Poroy but were told that half way down the hill we would be transferred to a bus. This is apparently done frequently during the rainy season. It really wasn't a big deal. They were well organized and the buses were clean and ready to go when the train pulled into the station...one word of advice is to use the restroom on the train before you disembark at the bus pick up spot or you will be stuck in a long line for the restroom, thus in the back of the line for the bus assignments. They tried to assign my family of 4 to a nearly full bus where we'd all have to sit next to strangers and we requested to sit together so they moved us to an open bus where we could sit together. Fortunately our bus driver drove safely (unlike a previous traveler). We arrived at the Cusco bus station then caught a taxi to our hotel. I really didn't mind this transfer. The train is so slow (even downhill), that I think we ended up saving a small bit of time and also by the time we switched to the busses it was almost dark out so I don't feel like I missed seeing anything, etc. I'm just sorta thinking they should give us a refund of a few bucks cause the train ticket wasn't cheap and approx 1/4 of the journey was on a bus which should be significantly less...but anyhow it wasn't enough to irritate me too bad cause I had just seen MP which was spectacular. All I cared about was staying relatively on schedule so we'd get to Cusco in time for dinner etc then catch our flight out the next day."

At Pachar we did have delays of over an hour, which was very disappointing for those who were only on a day trip to Machu Picchu.

So the views, always beautiful are not really scenic neither better than form the trail or the road. If you travel alone do take the Perurail using the cheapest version \"Expedition\". If you travel in group, you'll save money and confort renting a van with driver directly with the owner (120 to 150 USD the day) if 4 or less a cab would do the trick for even less and the views will be the same, and your schedule will be flexible!"

Constantly shifting down from 4th to 2nd around every bend, taking the wrong side of the road and as fast as he could.When we caught up with other vehicles, he would sit inches from the back of it, flashing his lights and then over taking at any point, including blind corners.He would randomly leave his full beam lights on when vehicles were coming in the other direction, making them have to flash him.To be honest, I'm surprised we made it back to Cusco without a serious accident.If possible I would seek alternative transport, as this company just seems to hire people with no ability to drive anywhere near safely."

The day before we were meant to be travelling we received an e-mail saying that the train wasn't running and we had to go to a different station to get a bus for the first 2 hours of the 3.5 hour journey! Given that most of the people getting the train were travelling I was amazed that it appeared that everyone had got the message - so if you have booked make sure you check your e-mail right up untl you travel! The coach on the way was quite pleasant but on the way back we were cramped up in a little minibus for 2 hours. There wasn't even an apology for the lack of train. On the plus side the vistadome train itself is really nice and the views of the mountains were fantastic - it was just a shame we were on it for so little time. You can see large portions of the Inca Trail with the Porters racing ahead of all the tourists walking up. I was also surprised at how nice the food they served was. There were clean toilets at all of the stations on route and on the train itself."

Although the Vistadome is more expensive, due to some problems with altitude and food differences, I knew the older, rocky Hiram Bingham Train might prove counterproductive. We chose the Vistadome not only for its smoother ride, but in order to see the tops of the mountain passes. The entire trip felt like a postcard. Dappled light through the roof as clouds skimmed overhead. The river raging next to the rails. Delightful fellow passengers on the train. Great weather added to the mood, but I would think even rain would be more inviting if one could look up and see it falling from the sky. Worth the extra money in our opinion, as we arrived in MP refreshed and excited to continue the feeling of discovery, not beat and tired, as some of our friends who chose the older trains."

I was delayed while waiting inside a collectivo in Cuzco but was subsequently led by the bus station people to the shared taxi station 10m next door. There I met Alfredo del Castilo, who wore Perurail uniform and told me I could follow him and be assured to reach Ollantay in time as he would be travelling on the same train with me.Needless to say, we took the same shared taxi and arrived on time. He led me to the Ollantay station while showing me where to take the collectivo back to Cuzco the next day after I had visited Machu Picchu. On the train, on hearing that I need assistance in finding a hotel, he offered to help. Indeed, on arrival at Aguas Calientes, he did go with me and helped to negotiated a good price for a hostel for the night. This is certainly appreciated given that I speak only about 50 simple, broken words of Spanish. And then I found out his position in Perurail Machu Picchu station.The next day, 31st Jan 2013, when I returned to Machu Picchu station again, Alfredo was there looking out for me to ensure that I was alright with the hostel. He also reuested the on-board train staff to assist me if required.And Celso Rios on the train asked whether I needed help to get a taxi or collectivo back to Cuzco. He accompanied me outside Ollantay station to ensure I had a seat on the collectivo before he left.Thanks Alfredo (and Celso). You made Perurail a preferred way to travel.Henry"

Well, we took the Vistadome train from Machu Picchu at the end of March, but we only rode the train to Poroy, then we were put on motor coaches to continue the rest of the way to Cusco. The only explanation for this was a prerecorded message saying something about the \"rainy season\" affecting the train service. We left @ 5:30 pm and arrived at an empty Perurail depot in Cusco @ 9:30 pm. Our transfer person said the other buses from our train had arrived @ 20 minutes earlier. We were not told we would be taking a bus until we arrived at the Machu Picchu station. We paid more for this train as was stated by other reviewers, but did not actually ride on the train for more than half the return trip. The train from the Sacred Valley the morning before was also inferior to the evening train today. The trains themselves are similar to commuter trains in the US, not like long distance trains there or in Europe. You can't really get up and move around, though there is a bathroom at the end of the car, but only 2 passenger cars and no food car. The view is nice, but you really only see the river from the right window seats and the overhead windows are essentially not functional. Don't expect the \"meal\" to be worth eating or adequate as both were smaller and less appetizing than bad airplane food. Luckily we ate breakfast at our hotel in the morning and lunch in Machu Picchu before the afternoon trip. We were treated to a fashion show of sorts by the train food service crew hawking \"alpaca\" products for sale on the pm train. It was somewhat amusing at best. The pm bus driver also answered his mobile phone twice and was driving with one hand while conversing with the caller in the dark on poorly lit local roads which were hilly and often populated with stray dogs along the side of the road. Our transfer person stated this is not legal in Peru, but that many people do it none-the-less. We were on the train leaving Machu Picchu in March, but I won't say exactly when as my friend on the same trip was afraid the driver would be fired for driving and using his phone. I really only want the company to enforce the phone ban on its drivers due to concerns about the safety of its passengers. I also tried to use the bathroom on the bus after a few hours in transit, but one of the train staff said it was not possible and the bathroom door was locked. I wish someone would have told us to use the train or station restrooms before boarding the buses. Luckily it was not an emergency. The seating assignments were odd also. I was traveling with 3 other people and we were seated in 3 different rows. Others around me swapped seats to travel with their companions. We arranged this trip 6 months ago and this is supposed to be low or shoulder season. I heard one passenger remark that it appeared the train company had made no effort whatsoever to seat passengers together. Ironically, at the end of the trip, they played a recorded message which stated they hoped it had been \"an unforgettable trip\"... It was."

I've lived in Cusco for almost a year, having been to Machu Picchu 8 times...lucky for me my company CAT Travel organizes customized trips through Peru, so I've made the trip to Machu Picchu trekking it (Inca Trail), training it (Expedition, Vistadome, & Hiram Bingham), and even one time I was with some old backpacker buddies and walked the train tracks to the town of Aguas Calientes! I will go ahead and NOT recommend that last option, if you wanna walk it...do the trek! In any case, the most reasonable option is the middle one, the Vistadome. It's not the fanciest of trains, however, the view from the cabin is truly incredible...why you might ask? Well, you can see where all the beautiful mountains touch the sky, and the curves and dives into the valley, without sticking your head out the window and pushing your friends for the window seat. On this train...everyone has what is seemingly ONE big window! The quarter panels of the ceiling on the train are made of Plexiglas, which means everyone gets to enjoy from wherever they are in the train. Yes, the food (or should I say snack) they provide is worthless, but if you want good food...well, you should find a local-minded guy (like me) who can recommend some good restaurants when you get there...or when you return to Cusco. Oh, and by the way, stay the extra night in Machu Picchu, sunrise over the ruins is incredible, and totally worth it after a long haul down to see such a beautiful site. Side note: If you're looking for fancy, go with the Hiram Bingham...there they will treat you like a king with a 3-course meal. If you're on a tight budget, just do the Expedition train...it gets you there comfortably (food is still worthless:)! See my post on Machu Picchu for more...!"

Never again will I ride the worlds most expensive train! Train was OK but needed to take a bus for about 1/2 the trip which was never disclosed prior to purchase or departure. The train staff was nice and friendly and the trip was great but the prices for the tickets and coustomer service couldn't be worse. A shame a world tourist site is being held hostage by greed!"

If you can get past the infuriatingly arduous process of procuring tickets, the actual trip to Machu Picchu is fairly nice.The views were spectacular, and this train (the Vistadome) was smoother and more comfortable than the Expedition. Definitely worth the marginal increase in price.Those recommending the Expedition to save money must not have actually ridden it. If you enjoy a rickety ride and uncomfortable seats, then, by all means, choose the Expedition. It's not about the view or the snack - the Expedition is noticeably unstable, and it makes for a jarring 3-hour trip. So, unless you have very deep pockets and consider the Hiram Bingham a viable option, go with the Vistadome. Service was cordial and attentive, but the \"entertainment\" was a bit much for the ride home. Exhausted and still glowing from the whole Machu Picchu experience, we wanted to reflect and relax. The singing and dancing, while well-intended, was intrusive at a time when we all just wanted to be left alone. Demanding audience participation from tired travelers is bad form.Still, this train is the best option."

There are no roads that connect Aguas Caliente (also called Machu Picchu Pueblo) to the outside world. You take the train all the way from Cusco or you take a train Ollantaytambo (take a bus or taxi from Cusco to Ollantaytambo). The only other real alternative is by foot. Only company operating train to Machu Picchu is Peru Rail. Few services run between Cusco to Machu Picchu. Most of the train services run between Ollantaytambo and Machu Picchu.Reservations must be done with plenty of time (one week or more on peak months) in advance due the high demand on this trip (no orad except train or Inca trail). Buy your tickets well in advance on online. Do not wait until you arrive in Cusco or Ollantaytambo to buy ticket especially the peak months from May to Sept. All of tikcet can be sold out serval days in advance. There are three type of train: Vistadome, Expedition (reasonable price), Hiram Bingham (exclusive luxury). It has good qualityof service but prices are quite high. One thing I did not like about Peru rail is that train attentants asked me and all passengers serveral time to buy Alfaca products and clothes they are selling on the train. I paid $129 for round trip from Ollantaytambo to Aguas Calient, 2 hours travelling time, 47 km each way."

The 57 miles trip from Cusco to the foot of Machu Picchu took us about 3 1/2 hours. The early morning trip was a lot of fun and exposed the passengers to the scenic countryside. The 3 cars were packed with tourists anxiously awaiting their first glimpse of Machu Picchu. We sat in groups of four around a small wooden table. A very light snack was served along with fresh tea or coffee on a decorative tablespread. Tranquil Peruvian pan flutes piped out soothing sounds in the background. The crew was courteous and friendly. The seating in Vistadome is adequate and comfortable.I estimate the train never exceeded 30 mph, so the trip was long, but offered an opportunity for those of us not in a hurry to savor the beautiful views offered by Mother Nature. The ceiling windows came in handy when it came time to capture some very tall mountain peaks with camera. (not sure it was worth the extra $35 per pax, though). The various switchbacks along the tracks enabled the train to easily climb and descend the 400 meter difference in altitude. The train ride was relatively smooth, and the interior of the cars are maintained impeccably clean. Seats are assigned prior to boarding, so there is none of the usual scrambling to find seats. Passengers who wanted to be seat near a friend or loved one can work it out amongst each other.The Vistadome costs an additional $35 per pax over the cost of an Expedition train ticket. If you are on a budget, I would consider sticking with the Expedition... you won't be missing much. A little extra view and a meager snack is not worth the extra money. Overall, I would say the train is abit of a novelty, fun to ride, but way overpriced (around $140 US) for the service provided. However, the only other option to get to Machu Picchu is the Inca Trail. I prefer to go by rail. LOL.There is no handicap access aboard the trains or stations."

Scenery was lovely, but we'd spent 4 days in Ollay already so it was much the same for the 1.5 hour journey. On saying that, we probably could have dropped down to the Expedition to save some money. ...However, from Aguas to Cusco on the Expedition, this was meant to be 3.5 hour trip. We ended up being delayed on the travel for 1 hour in the midst of the journey and were not given any explanation of the delay. Our trip was then a 4.5 hour. We were very lucky we didnt have a connecting bus that same night, which we originally planned to do, as we would have missed it. ...overall, I think this train service is overpriced for what it is. Its quite slow, so if you were to do the train one of you legs and perhaps look for an alternative for the other leg, you will save a lot of time and $$..."

We guess it was karma, but we ended up getting the two seats on the Vista dome train to Machu Picchu right behind the picture window and next to the engineer. If not, we believe the trip would not have been as wonderful as it was, as some of the seats in the car are placed so you are traveling backwards, and although there are large side windows by each seat, the \"vista dome\" windows are small and narrow above the seats. So, when you contact Peru Rail (we went through Avanti Adventures and Condor Travel of Peru, so did not select the seats ourselves), make sure to find out how to get these two seats assigned to you!That aside, we were very impressed with Peru Rail. The stations at both Machu Picchu Pueblo (Aguas Calientes) and Ollantaytambo wee spotless, with clean banos (even had TP which is a rarity in Peru) and waiting room facilities. The trains were spot on, time-wise, and although crowded, the people in the station kept people moving to their trains."

The service is decent, but the \"snack\" that had so much fuss made of it is pretty meagre considering the price, and you have no option, so if you're a veggie and today's option is meaty, you're stuck. However, you will have the sweet or cake to nibble on which comes with it.

Considering it was my only choice, I was satisfied with my ride. We picked up the train in Ollantaytambo and rode less than two hours into Aguas Calientes.Here are a few of my pointers. #1 I didn't realize until after I boarded that the seats are actually assigned. Be sure to request a window seat on the left as you head into Aguas Calientes. The Urubamba River is on your left and offers the best views throughout your ride. #2 I was so tired on my return trip to Ollantaytambo that I had no preference. #3 The train served a snack on the way there and a slightly heavier meal on the return. If you're a picky eater or simply require decent portions it wouldn't hurt to walk with your own snacks. #4 The train has luggage restrictions you must consider. My group handed out duffel bags and required everyone to pack for two evenings and leave their luggage in our Cusco hotel. #5 The Perurail employees perform a fashion show on the return trip, which is obviously intended as a sales effort to have you purchase exclusive alpaca products. #6 There is a traditional dancer who wears a costume and goes back and forth in the car. Some people found it annoying while others found it charming. #7 The train plays folksy music over the loudspeaker throughout the ride. Some people can tune it out while I found it annoying. #8 If you don't expect too much and your main objective is to arrive/depart Aguas Calientes safely, on time and comfortably, Perurail is a good choice."

A meal and soft drinks were included and it was good too.Book in advance if possible so you have more options. If you take the Vistadome one way that is enough, save yourself some money and get the Expedition back. Sit back and enjoy the view."

Having not taken the other trains to Machu Picchu, I can't really comment on their views/services but Vistadome does a pretty good job not just getting you where you want to go but trying to let you do it in style. The Vistadome views are amazing. The whole sides of the train are basically windows and about 2/3 of the roof. Amazing views and picture opportunities! The food is only \"eh\" but seriously, you're not taking the train for a gourmet meal. It's a snack and as long as you don't expect more than that, you won't be disappointed. The seating is pretty tight so yes, you will be getting cozy with your neighbors. It's set up around tables (for the food service) so you will have a person next to you and 2 across from you. Tough not to play footsie with the guy across as there isn't much leg room. There is a fun show on the way back. They can be a little pushy with the products they are trying to sell but just politely say no a few times and they should move on to the next person. You can get the same quality for much cheaper in Cusco. Oh and the one con was that on the return trip my wife and I were seperated. This was a last minute change that was not passed on to my travel agent. It kind of put a bad spin on a great trip as we had to spend the 3hr trip back with strangers rather than be able to talk about the magesty of what we had just seen at Machu Picchu."

The windows surround the roof of the train so it helps to see the peaks of the scenic mountains. I did not expect a snack to be included on the train. The servers lay out table runners and flowers before they bring out the snacks which is a nice touch. The train is a little commercial. On the way up they sold souveniers and on the way back there was a fashion show designed to sell alpaca clothing. It was however entertaining! The train plays music but I think it is the same music for the entire journey. They might want to switch the tunes.On the way up to Machu Pichu the bathroom was a bit dirty and the floor was very wet. It wasn't cleaned at all for the trip."

Once there, we enjoyed the local fanfare before taking the train to Aguas Caliente. The staff was very pleasant and apologetic that we had missed the train (not their fault!). An Andean snack was served, potato/cheese skewers and something like couscous with carrots... all delicious! On the train ride back to Cusco, traditional Andean table runners were laid on the table and we had more Andean Cuisine along with a bottle of wine. Very relaxing! The staff put on a fashion show (beautiful Alpaca garments) and a traditional dancer dressed in costume entertained us as well. We took the last train out of Aguas Caliente so it was dark when we arrived in Cusco. The scenery on this round trip was fantastic!"

I can only imagine how much time, money and food is wasted.), and the hard sell of the items that they wore in the fashion show.There is a cheaper train, with better snacks and no selling of items... that might be a better bet.

Initially I have to say that we had our arrangements booked quite late which made things a bit stressful but the PeruRail train ride was the worst bit of what I experienced as milking the tourism around Machu Picchu (which is an amazing site I would not want to have missed) to the maximum.As Swiss citizen, we are used to a very high quality of railway service, hence the contrast with PeruRail was quite stark. While the \"cheapest\" option costs around USD30 one way, we had only the VistaDome train option left (due to our late booking among other things) which comes at USD 50+ one way. We ended up paying USD 120 per person both ways (Ollantaytambo - Aguas Calientes) which compared to other means of transport in Peru but even by Swiss measures is a very high price for a 1.5hrs train ride. Admittedly the ride is impressive from a view perspective, however, the VistaDome rooftop windows do not enhance the experience so much. Further to that, we were crammed up into a 4 people compartment without any space to stow luggage. Throughout the ride we were exposed to the diesel exhaust of the train rendering us nearly unconscious and with a serious headache once we had reached Aguas Calientes, not sure if this is better in the other carriages however avoid carriage C to avoid the worst. In order to justify the horrendous price (in my eyes) RailPeru is serving a crappy snack and a beverage (classical airline food, alcoholic drinks cost extra).Due to a technical issue our train was delayed by half an hour on top which did not contribute to the experience.In a nut-shell, given there is no \"real option\" to the train (unless you are opting for the Inca trail or the luxury train) book the cheapest train and do it as early as possible to obtain lowest fares. Otherwise pay up for the luxury train or go for the Inca Trail (given my experience f the vast offerings in the Cusco area will be subject to similar treatment).Unfortunately, PeruRail is to me the spearhead around the Machu Picchu tourism industry (given the very poor value for money) which is seriously milking the cow and left me with a bad after-taste - Galapagos and other South American tourist attractions are also expensive but done in a much more sympathetic way giving the impression money was well spent."

If you're American, you will not be able to buy tickets directly through the website. You will get blocked by something called Verified By Visa, and when you call your bank to ask what the heck that is, you'll get ten different answers that all end with you still not being able to buy tickets.So what I did was contact PeruRail through email and ask for suggestions. They sent over a form where I was able to buy tickets by providing my credit card number. However, it was a worrisome process because they have slow communication. After I paid PeruRail it took a while before they sent the e-tickets, which was pretty nerve wracking. They really need to upgrade their system so non-Peruvians can purchase tickets with ease and security."

When me and my mom took the train from Ollantaytambo to Aguas Calientes we chose the Vistadome it has nice comfortable leather seats, panoramic views and on board service of snack tray and beverages. I highly recommend anybody interested in going to Machu Pichu to take a taxi from Cusco to Ollantaytambo and the vistadome train vs the expedition from Ollanta to Aguas.The price difference is not that much higher than the expedition and is well worthy. The vistadome doesn't make any stops and the expedition stops all the time to pick up the locals who travel in a different portion of the train, but all of the stops are a hassle and it makes the trip about 45 mts longer tna the vistadome. The expedition seats are not as comfortable and the onboard service is very basic, coffe or water and some peanuts. I am telling you take the vistadome is worthy to pay the extra, and is really not that much. You can go on the perurail website and plug in your route and dates, and a chart with prices and times will appear, then you will see the price difference is not that much more. I took the expedition from Aguas calientes back to Ollantaytambo and I won't do it again."

On Day 1 and not wanting to lose out on time at Machu Picchu, I took the Vistadome that departed Cusco at 6.59am. I boarded with coffee and croissant in hand, only to realise that there was going to be breakfast served on board. So much for fearing that there was not going to be food. The Vistadome crew was efficient and set about their meal service, entertainment and on board shopping cart service professionally serving a full carriage, and probably a full train. As we chugged along the rail lines towards Aguas Caliente past rolling vistas and streams along the way, the highlight (for me) came when the train went on the exaggerated zig zag down to allow our descent into the sacred valley. (I had read reviews that the zig zags were closed but perhaps this was a later set of zig zag switches, cos we definitely zig-zagged our way down and the announcement was also made by the train operator to proudly announce that we would be zig-zagging soon, a very Peruvian innovation to have trains scale mountains)The return journey (the next day) left around 5pm and we got in to Cusco around 9pm. Unlike the morning ride in to Aguas Caliente, the passengers on this evening train back in to Cusco were a little more boisterous (but not in a bad way), probably just happy from their Machu Picchu experience! And just for fun to toast to our Machu Picchu experience, we ordered a Pisco Sour from the bartender to enjoy on the journey back to Cusco too.Train departure and arrival times were punctual, no issues there. I booked the Vistadome tickets online on Perurail\u2019s website and it was a very easy site to navigate and use as well."

I took the \"backpacker\" class train on the way there, and the Vistadome on the way back. The two trains themselves are nearly identical. Both are overpriced, and for the extra 10-15 dollars, in the Vistadome you are subjected to a \"dancer\" and fashion show, all designed to take advantage of the captive audience and sell you expensive alpaca knits. I'd rather have been on the less expensive train and not trapped into shopping. The train ride itself and scenery were just fine, and I enjoyed comparing notes and plans with friendly fellow travelers on The way."

Having to be at the Train Station at 5:30am means getting up at 4am in the morning at Cusco. It is a 30 minute taxi ride from Cusco to Poroy (where the station is). Odd thing is that the attendants showed up at 6am. Only people at the station were me and 2 Japanese Tourists along with the coffee bar attendant! Brazilians and Argentinians showed up at 6:05am. The train is relatively comfortable but man it takes long to go 90 kms even if it is difficult terrain. Scenic vistas are OK, you probably will not get to see much with the early morning fog and constriction in the valley.Returning, this was early May it was dark by 6pm so most of the ride is in the dark, forget any scenic vistas. It gets back at 8:30-8:45pm.In comparison a cab from Cusco would take 2 hours at most. I suggest visiting Macchu Picchu after 1pm when the sun pops out of the winter sky and the tourists are losing their enthusiasm. On my next trip I wll stay in Ollantaytambo and take a taxi from there. Should be no more than an hour and leave leisurely at 11am. Return to Ollantaytambo at 6-7pm after Macchu Picchu closes at 5pm."

We appealed to the conductor who managed to get someone to switch with us as I get nauseated riding backwards. Your ticket does not indicate if you wil be sitting backwards or not. Vistadome is OK - but it is basically transportation - not a high-end experience like the Hiram Bingham cars. They did serve drinks (for a fee) as well as free soft drinks and little ham sandwiches. On the ride from Machu Picchu to Cusco we had a show (a clown/dancer type and a fashion show of Alpaca wear). Our seat mates were fun and we chatted with them much of the way.

But this will be compensated by the scenery surrounding you! As we were traveling during the rainy season, the river Urubamba was flowing, ferociuosly in full swing and you will travel along the river for most part of your journey. This is similar to the Trans Siberian Rail along with lake Baikal This journey takes around 2 hours plus to reach Aguascaientes. While returning, we were treated with some folk show and fashion show (?). The worst part in the whole program is the bus journey from Ollantaytambo to Cusco which is a bit boring.

(Because it was the rainy season, the first part of the journey from Cusco to Ollantaytambo was by bus). The good: The train itself is very comfortable and the service is better than on most short-haul flights (you're served a small meal and a soft drink). Email correspondence while planning the trip was quick and efficient.The bad: I had a lot of trouble using the Perurail website. Every time I tried to book a train, the session would time out once I had filled in all the details, so I ended up having to book by email (which thankfully, as mentioned above, was easy to do). The biggest complaint involves our return journey, though. We arrived at Machu Picchu station in good time. Shortly after arriving, a member of staff approached us (seemingly at random) and asked if we wanted to go on an earlier train. When it turned out it was an Expedition train, and not a Vistadome (which is what we had booked), we turned it down. What we didn't know at this point (because there weren't any announcements and this member of staff hadn't told us either), is that there had been a mudslide and that some of the trains had been delayed. Our departure time came and went without any announcements being made about our train, and then they suddenly called passengers for the Vistadome service that was due to leave about an hour after ours. When we went up to staff to find out what was going on, we were told our train was delayed - yet somehow this next Vistadome service (to the same destination) was leaving on time. It was only after we got a bit stroppy that they eventually found us seats on this train. (Goodness knows how long we would have waited for a train if we hadn't spoken up). Now I realise that mudslides are beyond Perurail's control but what is totally unprofessional is that in the 90 minutes we were at Machu Picchu station there wasn't a single announcement to explain to passengers what was happening or to inform us that our particular Vistadome service had been delayed. The bizarre: The piped music throughout the journey gets a bit much after a while. Also, the fashion show on the return journey was a bit surreal, although it did seem to be a big hit with at least some of the passengers..."

This was a highlight in our vacation, not only for the comfort, old world, luxurious, Orient Express atmosphere but also for the amazing service and care we received when we experienced a rather serious problem : Arriving in Juliaca, about 1 hour away from lake Titicaca where we were supposed to sleep on a floating island, the weather changed for the worse, and we noticed snow/hail on the ground (unusual in October, spring in the highlands). 10 mn later, it was pouring cats and dogs (which, we later learned, is somewhat usual at night around lake Titicaca, as the days are gloriously sunny which makes water evaporate and form clouds in the evening). Panicked at the idea of sleeping on a floating island in pouring and freezing rain, we tried to use our mobile to cancel it and book a room in the Libertador on the shore of the lake, to no avail! Between my poor Spanish skills and the choppy communication, I could not get anywhere. Fortunately, Mr. Arnoldo Ponce de Leon De La Cruz, on board supervisor, took things in hand, and swiftly cancelled my reservation and made a new one with the Libertador, even using Trip Advisor to get us the best rate, and finally got us a taxi as soon as we arrived. Mr. De La Cruz, thank you for all your help! Without you, we would have been stranded on a cold and wet island!

We enjoyed each minute of the 10:30h trip. The food,which is prepared fresh on board, was excellent. The lavatories were cleaned in short intervals so that you always found them in perfect condition. Our stop at LA ROYA was very interesting, the market is colourful and it also gives you the possibility to take nice pictures of the small church, the train and the locals dressed in their colourful dresses. Before arriving in CUSCO, Mr. Arnoldo Ponce de Leon De La Cruz came to each of us to say goodbye and give last information about the city of CUSCO and how the reach easily our hotels. We thought that this is what we would call a personalised 5 stars service. Thank you very much to the entire Andean express team."

It all started with being served coffee in the waiting room in Cusco. Once on the train there was breakfast, followed by lunch and ending with afternoon tea. This was interspersed with music and dance throughout the journey. The scenery was fascinating and we stopped at a couple of places along the way, especially the highest point which gave a chance to sample the wares of the locals (how fortuitous!). The opportunity to observe the countryside from the rear carriage is not to be missed. We passed through a town which was reminiscent of the old Wild West whereby the train goes down the Main Street. The locals have market stalls along the track and raise the awnings as the train goes through then put them back up after it's past! Fascinating. By the time we reached Puno it was dark and we were getting a little weary but overall it was very worthwhile. "

Perhaps we weren't expecting much but I was amazed when we arrived to find that we were going to be travelling in luxury! The staff were outstanding right from the start. When we checked in we were informed that we would be sharing a table and travelling backwards. The lovely guy asked if we'd like to be moved to a similar class. The only thing was that by changing we travelled with a German speaking group, but that wasn't an issue. While the trip is 10 hours, the time flew by and it was so comfortable. Our every need was seen to. I was a bit worried about the food because I need gluten free. I wasted energy worrying, I was so well looked after. The corn bread was not only beautiful to look at but was delicious. The rest of the food was outstanding as well. The whole experience was amazing. Really interesting to see the changing landscape, interesting townships and markets passing by. There's entertainment but apart from the Pisco Sour demo we didn't bother because we were entertained in our seats sufficiently.Cannot thank the amazing staff enough, it was a highlight of our trip. (One small hint - don't let the baggage crew take your bags if you don't have money to pay them. We unfortunately had a guy grab our bag and even though we asked him to leave them he insisted on carrying them out for us. It was awkward when we didn't have cash to give him the expected tip. Just left an uneasy feeling after such a wonderful experience)"

A lot of the guide books seem to dismiss this trip as being slow and bumpy and say that travel by road is preferable as it is quicker and the route very similar, well they are wrong!!!The train is now run by Belmond and has that luxury feel from the moment you arrive in the station and are shown to your seat. For us the first highlight was the traverse of the street market in Julianca, the stalls open up in front of the train, in some cases the goods for sale being left on the track as the train passes, and then the market closes up on the track again after the train has gone by so that looking back you cant see where the railway line was.The train line does run parallel to the road at some points but diverges for long distances as well passing through a range of scenery from the Altiplano to mountain passes to lush arable land, between mountains, alongside rivers and through towns. A constantly changing panorama. There is a short stop at the highest point where you can get out and then on to Cusco travelling through the city.All the way the service is attentive the meals are good and the views spectacular. The carriages and observation car are vintage with wood paneling and brass fittings and the toilets spotless. If you look at the price it is less than a 3 hour intercity train in the UK so what more do you want?Dont miss it"

This would be a big negative, but I guess is a buyer-beware risk."

While it's cheaper and faster to take the plane to Juliaca and then hire a driver, you miss both the scenery and the experience of this unique train trip. This trip is comfortable, scenic, and pleasant. The meals (lunch and afternoon tea, which is served while going through Juliaca) are tasty and filling, and there's live music and dancing for entertainment as well. When touring the area, I do recommend starting in Machu Picchu, then Ollantaytambo, then Cusco, then Puno, in order to ease oneself into Puno's very high altitude. If this train trip is within your budget, I recommend this delightful way of getting to Lake Titicaca. The Puno train station is right in the center of town."

This is an incredible event, with thousands of people in amazing, colorful costumes dancing and playing traditional instruments, both in street parades and in the stadium. Because it is the \"rainy season\" there were very few foreign tourists. The participants were grouped in teams, I gather from communities in the region, and competed in the stadium, and then marched through the streets. The next day they carried the giant Virgin statue from one church to the other through the streets, dumping tiny baskets of flowers from the upper stories of the buildings as the Virgin passed. The Virgin statue was so tall they had to lift the overhead phone and cable lines up to let it pass. Really, go to Puno, see the Festival. Take a raincoat, as there could be occasional showers--not a big deal if you are from Michigan.As the many reviewers have stated, the train ride from Puno to Cusco is wonderful. The high plains scenery was spectacular. The food was great; the bar car empty because it was the low season. The back of the bar car is an open platform, which was fun to ride on, out in the breeze. The highest elevation of the ride was 4312 meters; if you have breathing difficulties this could be an issue. I was told they have supplemental oxygen on the train, although none of passengers on our trip experienced difficulties."

I wanted to purchase a Peru Rail vest, which was not sold on the train. I mentioned this fact to one of the train attendants, and he asked the size of vest I wanted. The train attendant then radioed ahead to the station, and while i was claiming my luggage, my vest was delivered to me. Highly recommend this trip for traveler who wants to be pampered. Also, I recommend taking the trip from Puno to Cusco, as there fare is less than half of the Cusco to Puno fare."

It is a wonderful way to cross from Puno to Cusco (or vice versa but I gather the Cusco to Puno route is much more expensive). Service was great, ambience and comfort were great and food was great. They do have musicians and a dancer who give a show for about an hour which is a bit touristy but hey, no-one makes you go to the bar carriage to watch it if you don't want to. My favourute bit was the viewing platform at the back from which you can take some great pics. Highly recommended."

It added such a unique element to our trip. The carriages were comfortable and spacious. Staff were extremely friendly and efficient. The entertainment on board, stops and food service made 10 hours pass very quickly. The panoramic carriage was great - it can get busy but equally there were times when I was the only one in it snapping away at the beautiful vistas. The alpaca items that they sell on board Peru Rail are actually really reasonable - I held out after seeing a lovely poncho on our Macchi Picchu train as someone told me about an outlet in Cusco but a similar item was way more heavily priced. Luckily I picked something up on the Andean Explorer and the quality has been great - it saw me through the winter. As long as you go on board aware that it is 10 hours, it is thoroughly enjoyable and I'd highly recommend!"

The company knows its customers: rich white europeans. The Track is beautiful and this sort of travelling is really chilled down. But the company also thinks that a brakefast in south america can cost 50 soles, which is honestly said an impudence. all the prices of things that are not included in the 180$ train price, are like this. Additionally i felt ashamed for the people who were on the same train, for how they looked at and treated the peruanian staff. it feels a little bit like on a cruise trip with old rich white aristrocratic europeans."

Upon arrival at Wanchaq station, our bags were collected from the Taxi by porters and we were escorted to a Lounge where we were checked-in and served Tea/Coffee. Then we were shown to our seats. The train started on time and made it's way through beautiful Andes Mountains. The Train consisted of 3 Carriages, one Bar/Lounge and and Observation Car. There was a 3 Course Meal with Wine (With Vegetarian Option) served. The Train had only one stop, at La Raya - highest point on the route. Also, a group of musicians performed folk music and couple of dancers performed as well in the evening. Towards the end the Train also passes through crowded markets near Juliaca, and it was an interesting sight to see local vendors making way for the train and getting back to business once it passes. Upon arrival in Puno, the luggage was unloaded in advance and sorted neatly for us to collect without any delay. It was very courteous of the Manager to enquire regarding our onward transportation. When he realised we had to find a taxi, he himself arranged a safe and standard Taxi for us at standard rate to our Hotel. It was an experience of a life time and really worth it!"

Problem was that we arrived at night and the office was closed. Even though our hotel was an hour outside of Puno, Cesar promised to deliver our merchandise to our hotel. An even larger problem was that during our stay at the Titilaka Hotel, the transportation workers were on strike and worse yet they barricaded the roads into and out of both Puno and Juliaca (see attached photo). In order to get to the airport, we had to take an hour plus in detours around the strike. True to his word, on the way to the airport, our driver presented us with a package from Cesar.

There is no comparison at all. You will be uncomfortable in the bus and you will be disappointed at how many things you'll miss because the is driver is in a hurry to get to the destination. This train ride is as comfortable as it can possible get and more. You'll even get a couple of shows. The staff is incredibly well trained and you will feel like you are in a 5 star hotel.

I was surprised there were so few tourists on the train when I travelled with my 22-year-old daughter who happened to be the youngest traveler on board outside of the year old baby. I think there may have been at most 40 passengers. I did not encounter one Peruvian or Peruvian American on the train. All the other passengers were Americans, Canadians or Europeans. If you are a Peruvian living outside the country and can afford to take this indulgence which is approximately$325.00 per person (May 2015) then I would pay for it as it well worth the experience. This is a wonderful way to see and experience the heart and soul of Peru. The service is first class. You sit in these big comfy seats and are provided white tablecloth service. We were served a beautiful lunch by young Chef Pedro. Our server was Eduardo a young man that had just started working for the Andean Explorer. It takes about 10 hours and the train makes a couple of brief stops along the way. One being La Raya, the highest point in Peru, 4,319 above sea level. During the 10 hours, one is entertained by musicians from Cusco and later in the day by musicians from the Puno region. In addition, Bar Master, Marco Omar provides a a lesson on making Peru\u2019s famous \u2018Pisco Sour.\u201d Passengers are welcomed during the course of the day to see the view in the last railway car that is partially exposed. My daughter and I travelled from Cusco to Puno and left approximately 8:30 a.m. and arrived in Puno around 6:00 p.m. The experience is simply luxurious. As you get closer, you pass Juliaca, which is the industrial engine for the region. While passing the busy market in such close proximity, the train inches through this heavily busy part of the city. As first glance, the area seems a bit run down or poor through Western eyes, but look closer, it is a bustling market made up of small micro-enterprises. Honestly, as I sat with white table cloth in front of me amongst the number of hardworking businesses I felt a little out of place but this is the side of Peru worth seeing as well. If you go, I would recommend that you inquire which side of the train one should sit on to get the best view (east or west side depending where you are travelling from). Also, please be sure to not only tip the server but the young lady that spends her entire day cleaning up the bathrooms, cleaning up the mess the patrons may leave on a moving train."

How wrong can you be?(We hadn't read any reviews before we went)The train may take 10 hours, but it's a first class experience throughout. From the waiter served 3 course lunch, to the upholstered armchair type seats, to the bands in the bar/ observation coach it is a relaxing way to see the amazing scenery.The first half of the journey rises through the mountains to a half way stop at the high point (where there are local crafts to be bought) and then the track crosses the altiplano where llama and alpaca herds graze. Beautiful."

The ride was comfortable and the food was sooooo tasty! Better than alot of restaurant meals weve had. The route was so beautiful and we stopped off at a market to buy local handicrafts. With a local band and dancers entertaining us, the journey sometimes got a little touristy but with free bar snacks on tap, a beautiful open back carriage to watch the views and great great, we cant complain! A shame it lead to Puno! If you can get it from puno instead you will have a perfect trip!"

Not only are you TAKEN to your seat by the train staff, the trip begins with a mimosa in your seat! The train starts off in Cusco and you are able to stand at the back of the open train as it leaves the city -- an experience itself. The train then winds its way through the mountains reaching a height of 14,000 feet. It then proceeds close to the shores of Lake Titicaca having gone through a bustling market town where stall holders actually sold their wares right up against the train tracks!! What an experience!!"

The journey from Cusco to Puno takes 10h30 yet flies by as you drink in the scenery and the many Pisco sours... The food served on board (lunch and afternoon tea included and a delicious and huge breakfast available at an additional and very reasonable cost) is of extremely high quality and the carriages are dressed beautifully. There are only two carriages for passengers so there is plenty of room to move about the train and enjoy the view from the last carriage, which is open at the back to allow for some amazing photographs as you wind through the Andes and the Altiplano. There is some on-board entertainment which is fun but not intrusive, with local bands and dancing twice during the journey and also a lesson on how to make the perfect Pisco sour. My boyfriend volunteered immediately to be the bartender after the wonderful actual bartender, Marco Omar, showed us all how to do it, and he had a great time. In our five week trip through South America this is one of the things we were looking forward to the most and we were even more impressed with the reality - wish there was a longer option with sleeper carriages! Thank you to all the staff on board who made it such a special experience, and especially Marco. p.s one tip - take cash because understandably a moving train through Peru doesn't have the best signal for the card payment system and this didn't work too well when we came to the end of the journey and had to settle up for the extras we'd had."

We took the train from Cusco to Puno in preference to the road trip without being fullly aware of the superb quality of the Andean Explorer or the excellence of the experience. Two passenger carriages in the middle of the train, very well furnished in wood and with very comfortable armchairs and proper tables, are supported by a staff/kitchen car to the front and a bar/observation car to the rear. The last is split into a bar area with armchairs and occasional tables and, at the very rear, an observation platform with an open rear. There's a clear reflection of the Orient Express in the style and quality. The service was superb throughout, with excellent food and drink and very helpful staff. The journey takes about ten hours (the train isn't fast) but the scenery is glorious and the whole experience outstanding. Being picky, it would have been nice to have the morning coffee on the house but, other than that, I can't fault it."

Great views from the observation car, and even just from your seat. Bar near the observation car. Dancers and musicians gave shows during the journey (morning and afternoon). The train does not go particularly fast, which means you can observe the changing scenery. However this means it is a long journey. the train leaves at 8am and it is dark by the time you arrive in Cusco or Puno (depending which way you travel).There is only one stop - at the highest point, where the locals have stalls etc. Mind you, going through Juliaca is an experience as the train goes right through the main market.BUT... at 10h 30m the journey was just too long."

Upon arrival at Puno station, we were seated in a pleasant waiting room and served tea. Groups were then taken individually to their comfortable seats on the train. The interior of the train is delightful and just as in the pictures!. The observation car was terrific as well as the bar/lounge area. It was very easy to move between the carriages. There were two groups of Peruvian entertainers - both were great and had the passengers enthralled with their performances. The on board staff were very attentive and nothing was too much trouble for them. The lunch was wonderful and there was an endless supply of snacks. The scenery on the journey was spectacular and the 10 hours just flew by. Unfortunately the train broke down about an hour from Cusco. I have to commend the staff of Peru Rail (especially the On Board Services Manager, Arnaldo) for his communication to the passengers throughout the delay. We were eventually transferred to buses and taken to Cusco. This entire operation was done speedily and efficiently. There wasn't one grumpy word from any of the passengers.We would not hesitate to recommend taking the train either from Puno to Cusco or Cusco to Puno. It was a great day - despite the bus trip at the end."

I decided on a whim to just do it and booked my ticket the night before. I had had a terrible experience with a 10 hour bus ride earlier in my trip and really liked the train option. For me, the train was great. It was the slow season so we were only one car of tourists. The food was good (I'd been in Peru a while beforehand) and the service, excellent. The bar car was fun and the bartenders friendly. I especially enjoyed the open air car in the back and spent most of the ride there, practicing my Spanish with fellow passengers from Mexico or exchanging USA stories with others. The train passes through some spectacular scenery, even while it rained a bit. Since it's clearly catering only to tourists, there were two different bands playing local instruments and a pisco making class. Of course, the bands offered to sell their CDs at the end of the program but every tourist attraction in Peru has this distraction. Now, for the bad parts of the experience. The train is ONLY for tourists. There is no way Peruvians can afford it. The tracks go through very poor pueblos in Peru and, right outside Puno in Juliaca, through the center of a market. I took a video of the townspeople setting up their stalls again as we passed and of fruit laying inside the tracks to be sold. We rolled right over it. Since I usually like to travel as a local as much as possible (taking colectivos and buses and staying in cheaper accommodations and homestays), I felt like a spoiled American the entire time. Since I usually travel in a more local way, I understood the fact that there is no air conditioning on the train (the only place I'd seen it in seven weeks in Peru was at the school where I studied Spanish while in Lima) and preferred that the servers spoke with me in Spanish (So I'm not sure about their English anyway)."

You are received with a welcome drink and folkloric animations at 10am, and the day is punctuated with delicious food, drinks, music, dances and even a bartending class in the afternoon. There's an open view car at the end of the train from which you can take pictures. The arrival into Juliaca's busy street market along the train tracks is also impressive! Compliments to Perurail for offering such an amazing experience!"

What a marvellous experience this train trip from Cusco to Puno was, the carriages are luxurious and I felt very spoilt to be able to travel in this civilised manner. The beautiful individual arm chairs are very comfortable to both sit and sleep. Within the first class carriages the configuration consists of a single seat on one side and two seats on the other side of the aisle. Each configured in a single seat facing each other and double seats facing each other. The toilets like the rest of the carriage are nicely decorated and cleaned very regularly, they are not like ordinary train toilets.The wait staff are very attentive and any request is soon completed. The saloon car at the rear of the train has a bar and some seating, with an open section right at the back for photographs and taking in the beautiful scenery. In regard to the scenery, doesn't matter where you are, you will be able to take it in, whilst you wind through the beautiful mountains and along the backs of the river.The three course meal for lunch was excellent, the Chilean wine was very good and afternoon tea topped it off. The journey provided entertainment in the form of singers and dancers and also a demonstration of how to make Pisco Sour. I thoroughly enjoyed this journey and would highly recommend it."

Our hosts were Ingrid and Julio.Let's keep it simple: it was an amazing and unforgettable experience. As part of the journey/price you get:- transportation to cusco in a beautiful and very comfortable train (think orient express). You have your own seat with a personal table.- great food: welcome mimosa drink, 3 course lunch (michelin star level), snacks throughout the train, hot drinks, tea snack ('high' tea) later in the day- entertainment: 2 live music and dancing sessions, pisco sours lessons- a beautiful open carriage at the back with glass ceiling: here you can experience live the scenery you go through (amazing). E.g. We went through the market in Juliaca connecting with the locals waving at us as we passed through.Don't think of it as an expensive train ticket: think of it as a day tour in the cusco/Puno area... That also happens to take you to your destination. Highly recommended."

(Yes, it was our mistake, that we didn\u2019t check, if we had had everything right on that place.) We thought that it had fallen down under the chairs and went to the train station and into the train the next day. We searched everywhere in our car, but nothing. We also wrote an email to Peru rail with our problem, but they did nothing except general answer to our email.So it was extremely expensive journey for us."

The whole journey between Cusco and Puno is about 10.5 hours; but you do not even realize that in the Andean Explorer. The Andean Explorer checks all the boxes for a wonderful train - the carriages are elegant, with comfortable seating and tables covered with white tablecloths. Gourmet food is served, and they provide a complimentary drink on arrival and wine with the lunch. The staff and service is excellent - they are well trained and they make an effort to ensure that you are taken care of. Bathrooms were clean and well-maintained too; and they stayed that way for the entire journey. It is a long journey, and it was great to see that the staff had taken care of all aspects.Onboard entertainment was interesting - you could sit in the bar car and enjoy local music played by a live band, you could take a class to learn how to make Pisco Sour and off course, there was the fashion show. But what was most fun, was standing at the open viewing car at the end of the train taking in the Andean scenery and also watching local life, when the train passed towns.The train stops at a La Raya, which is the highest point on this route. Almost everyone got off - you can just walk around, or buy sweaters and trinkets from a local market (right where the train stops!).It is 10.5 hour, when you just relax, enjoy the wonderful service, sit around watching the landscape go by and take pictures - many, many pictures!"

After handing in the luggage, we boarded the train, not quite knowing what to expect. The journey took 10.5 hours at a maximum speed of 40km/h, and it didn't seem to drag at all, with comfy chairs, white tablecloth-covered tables, welcome drinks/snacks, lunch, afternoon tea - like a Rovos Rail day trip, through the Andes! There is a viewing car at the back, and the 3 main carriages have huge windows where we watched the world go by - literally - in some towns there are markets taking place on the tracks, so the train hoots to get everyone to clear the tracks - even when people moved off the tracks, if the windows were open we could have picked up anything from food and clothing to tyres, engines, nuts and bolts! We went sedately past villages, herds of llamas, alpaca, cows, sheep, with beautiful snowcapped mountains in the distance the closer we got to Cusco.There were various 'activities' on the train over the day, in-between meals - Peruvian music and dancing, Pisco Sour demos, fashion show (i.e. trying to sell me more scarves).Well worth it!"

Comfortable seating with the option for sitting in your assigned table chairs or sitting in observation/bar car. Considering the space of train kitchen the food service is excellent. Breakfast is served, lunch is an option of two main course. Tea service is served late afternoon. Wine, hot chocolate, juice and soft drinks are available. Entertainment is done in the observation car which included two cultural music groups and Pisco sour class. Entertainment is not mandatory so it does not interfere with your quiet time.

Agreed with the comments from others - lots of entertainment, great sights, luxury travel. Rather than read a heap of crap I have summarised some main tip below:1. The literature states that you need to check in and get your tickets 4 hours before departure - well, this is South America!!!!2. Stay a night or two in Puno before / after the train journey. Puno is surprisingly pleasant and is located on Lake Titicaca if you want to do a tour.3. Don't buy the drinks too early - happy hour is at 3.00pm (2 for 1)4. Train stops half way at the highest point where there are some local markets - haggle and grab a bargain!!5. sit back and enjoy a thoroughly relaxing rideOverall, we had a great time, service was excellent, and a comfortable journey to Cusco. We would recommend you do this once in your life."

In the bigger towns, it is magnificent to see how the railway has been incorporated into the market with the stall holders temporarily collapsing part of their stall to give way to the train.For those who were fed up with the scenery (how could you!), some local entertainment was provided by troops of musicians and dancers.Although the weather during the latter part of the day turned rather overcast, this could not detract from the sheer beauty of the countryside and the journey overall."

Quality of food and drinks is very high during the whole trip.Entertainment in the bar was great with two folklore musical groups and dance shows which are great for passing the time sipping some Pizco Sours, the staff i great and the barman provides some tips make real Peruvian Pisco sours.But the highlight of the trip and the ride has to be the open ended last train wagon after the bar, there is nothing like standing here with a camera while you go through and actual market that gets our of the way while the train passes ever so slowly o while arriving to Lake Titicaca."

The train is elegant and comfortable - a kind of Peruvian Orient Express - with only two passenger cars, a bar, and an open observation car. Drinks, meals and snacks were served throughout the day by extremely charming staff. Entertainment in the form of pan pipe music and dancers was provided both in the morning and afternoon, but the best entertainment was standing in the observation car watching the stunning Andean scenery roll past."

We were staying on Lake Titicaca (uros aroma uro island - wee my other review for this place because it was amazing) up through the andes to Cusco. The train service is very professional and very much 5*. The seating arrangement is spaced out and the last two carriages are lounge areas that people are free to get up and socialise. We made friends with 6 others on the day we travelled just by drinking and chatting all day - coincidentally we bumped into them a week later up Machu Michu.Train journey is a comfortable 10.5 hours, with food and entertainment and a half way stop it really does just float by. The sights from the windows and the back of the train are amazing, especially the huge open landscapes. The train reaches the half way point at about 4,200m - we didn't notice anyone had breathing issues. The air is fresh and cool.One thing I was a little disappointed about was the food. I expected a little more, the portions were al la carte, but still very small - this didn't take too much away from the experience but i would have preferred normal human sized portions and more opportunity to eat. To paint the picture i am a 28yr old, 12 stone, athletic runner and even I got a bit hungry. Because the train leaves early we didn't have breakfast, i would get it on the train...Once we set off i ordered the 'traditional american breakfast' from the menu....what i got was two eggs. That was all, i thought they were playing a joke with me and asked where the rest was, that was it. Hugely misleading, they should have names it 'two eggs on a plate' then i would have ordered 6 of them. Peru Rail if you are reading this, please add other items to this breakfast option because two eggs is not a meal.Would i recommend you to take this train - certainly! Yes it cost more, big wow you'll only ever do the journey once in your life probably. Everytime my wife tells our story she loves talking about the train we took from Puno to Cusco, no body loves talking about the cheap bus they took with 40 others squeezed in with all their bags that saved them 4hrs on their trip."

I was a little sceptical due to a poor experience on the Trans Alpine in New Zealand. But this was outstanding. The first thing I thought when I boarded was that it seemed similar to the Orient Express. Indeed, the manager advised us that it is owned by the same parent company. The carriage was very comfortable with armchairs as opposed to regular train seats. The food was first class and excellently served. There is a bar car and an outside viewing car at the back which was great fun and not hogged by selfish passengers. The ten hour journey just flew past. If you have to travel from Cusco to Puno or vice versa you must give this serious consideration"

I took the journey as part of a trip with Titan Travel and it was better than anticipated. My journey was from Cusco to Puno (lake Titicaca). Obviously the weather can play a part in the views my trip was at the end of the dry season (October) and had clear blue sky's throughout. One word spectacular. The train itself is very comfortable with single tables, doubles (facing and side by side) and foursomes. The staff will do their best to suite your requirements for travelling with friends partners etc. You sit in armchairs that to me were very comfortable.You wont sit for long however as a visit to the observation car is a must, with large glass windows and open viewing platform at the end of the car. On the way you pass through the lounge car with a bar. As its a ten hour trip you may wish to avail yourself of its facilities at some time during the journey.Lunch and tea were provided and of excellent quality.Drinks at the bar were not cheap but for this type of train not outrageous (15 Sol for a beer).As its a 10 hour journey you should also be aware that the toilets were clean and spacious and comfortable, an important factor for many people.To sum up a must do if you are travelling in Peru not cheap but worth the price."

The Andean Explorer is not a cheap way to travel from Puno to Cusco but it is a great way to see the country side between the two stations,a 10hr journey covering approx 300km.Starting from Puno the first point of interest is travelling passed Lake Titicaca and on to Juliaca with its large market spread out either side of the railway track and in some cases between the tracks.The scenery then changes to the plains where you can catch a view of llamas.The next stop is the highest point of the journey at 4319m there are also market stalls selling the normal souvenirs plus a small church,from there the scenery gets better as you follow the course of the Huatanay river where you can see plenty of wild life especially birds until Cusco is reached.The train has a observation car at the rear where there also a bar,during the journey there is a dance show so get there early for a seat as it's not a big space, all staff are very polite and friendly, water is available at all times,the food portions are small and in some cases not that hot,for those people suffering with altitude sickness the train also have oxygen bottles available,all in all a good experience"

There is some theatre at Puno station to set the mood of the journey, and soon after it left cameras were busy taking photos of the lake. The train then squeezes slowly and literally through the middle of a large market and the scenes of every day life for the local residents were very interesting. Scenery changes as the track climbs and eventually reaching the summit at 14,000 feet, it then stops for ten minutes to allow the travellers time to view the local church and buy yet more alpaca scarves from the market. The observation car allowed everyone to take many pictures of the impressive scenery and of people working the fields and carrying on with everday life.The lunch, afternoon tea and dinner were very good too. Waht a joy, this is one of the great railway journeys of the world and if you are on the well trodden route towards Machu Picchu via Puno, thsi is an absolute 'must do' only bettered by the Higham Bingham train on the final leg to the lost city."

Just unfortunate that the high altitude made us feel a bit unwell, so we did not appreciate the journey to its fullest. But one really feels like one is travelling on the Orient Express. Five star service, good food, entertainment provided, beautiful scenery, fantastic sunset - what more could you ask for.... One recommendation - book your tickets by yourself, and book early. We booked six months in advance, and made the booking ourselves, since our travel agent said they could not yet guarantee that we would be able to get a confirmed seat. As soon as we received that message we went on line to Perurail and booked immediately, no problem. The result was that we got excellent seats, right next to the lounge car and observation deck. Suppose that if you are seated near the front of the train the exhaust fumes might bother you and it would be a longer walk to the lounge car, but we did not have that problem. Booking by yourself might perhaps be costlier than having a travel agent make the booking, but worth the extra cost."

As you sip your Pisco Sour or Cusquena beer, listen to a band of talented Peruvian musicians play different songs in the bar.

We travelled around Peru using most shapes and forms of transport but have to say this is the classiest way to travel, taking in breath taking scenery from Puno to Cuzco. Once checked in at the station we were greeted by a Peruvian band playing on the platform. Our larger cases were loaded on the train by the porters and we just took our essentials on board. It was just like the Orient Express with wonderful friendly, attentive staff who showed us to our carriage and worked very hard the whole 10 hour trip. They never seemed to stop serving food and refreshments brought to our table which was decorated with a rose in a vase and a little 1920's era lampshade on crisp white table linen. We even got a free glass of wine with one of the meals and a free Pisco Sour cocktail at the back of the train where the bar was located. One lady got quite tipsy - luckily I'm a hardened drinker!The 10 hours flew by as we were entertained by Peruvian dancers and a fashion show during the journey. It's best to get into the bar at the back of train before any of these events start so you get a good seat which are limited. You also get the best views from here as the carriage is open at the back. I loved it when we slowed down to a snail's pace and went right through a local market and could almost touch the people selling their wares! You'll be amazed at what some of them sell. We also stopped at another market for 15 minutes where we had a chance to get off the train for some retail therapy. The elegance, comfort, service and whole experience was fantastic,it's just a shame I didn't have the elegant clothes to go with it. A lot of the other passengers also wore hiking boots so I didn't feel out of place. All in all I would highly recommend the Andean Explorer, one of the highlights of our trip."

However, we were so surprised when we realized the trip was much more than pure transportation. As soon as we got out of our taxi, someone jumped and grabbed our luggage and took it to the section where they tagged the luggage to be handled by train staff. No more dragging of the heavy luggage around. Wow..Then we showed our passport and ticket to very well dressed/well mannered train employees who pointed us the way to our car. Live Peruvian band was playing at the station. At each car another very well dressed employee welcomed us on board and showed us to our seats. These were not your typical train seats. They were more like a living room chair. We had a table with a white table cloth with a white vase that held a beautiful red rose. The inside of the train looked beautiful with wood panelling and crystal light fixtures. As soon as we sat another employee asked us if we wanted any tea/coffee/water (which was included for free during the entire trip). About an hour into the trip, we were invited to go to the Bar car. We were served a welcome drink and a few appetizers while the Puno band performed live music accompanied by their beautiful dancer. After an hour or so, we were invited to go back to our seats to order our 3 course lunch (which was included in the ticket). There was a lunch menu that contained a couple of appetizers and three Entrees and a dessert. A glass of wine or soft drink was also included with the lunch. All were served in nice china and were decorated like a high class restaurant. Wow...Once we got to the highest point of the trip, train stopped for 15 minutes so we could take pictures and visit the local market. We then continued on. At 3pm there was a demo at the bar on how to make Pisca Sour and then happy hour started (buy one get one free drink with plenty of munchies). After that another band from Cusco started to play music and they had their own dancer. Then it was the tea time where we went back to our seats and were served tea/coffee along with a plate of goodies. After that there was a fashion show to display the beautiful shawls and scarfs made from Alpaca wool. By the time we made it to Cusco station, we were actually upset that the trip was over. We had so much fun and the staff made our trip so enjoyable. Thanks so much for all the ones on board who made it such a memorable trip. My hats off to the PeruRail for offering such a wonderful service."

Sometimes the black smoke that is passing outside was so thick that it casts shadow - sun eclipse... check attached image: through clean window against the blue sky... But must say that service is excellent: crew works extremely hard throughout all 10 hours ... Scenery, the first half of the trip from Cusco to Puno is stunning... Second half is rather boring... But no matter what the service is, no matter how beautiful the outside is, everything's very much spoiled by the stink you have to breath for the whole trip. Would not do it again or recommend to anyone... One can take a bus through exactly same road, make the trip much faster, save money and not get poisoned by carbon monoxide..."

I was spellbound by the sheer luxury of the carriage, it was the Peruvian model of the Orient Express, and something I was not expecting. I knew we were going to be experiencing something very special and the whole journey was exceptional. Some reviews said the price was expensive!!!! No way! We had spent the best money of our trip.We were on a group tour and had seats in the carriage next to the bar and viewing car at the back which meant we were well placed for the fabulous Andean pan pipe music and singing group which entertained us. The atmosphere was fantastic, everyone was joining in and the carriage was packed with myself sitting on the floor having the time of my life. The service was fabulous, the food very good, we just felt it was the most pleasurable day. The time flew past even though the train travels quite slowly allowing you to soak up the wonderful scenery. I spent some quiet moments at the back of the observation car on my own thinking I was the luckiest person to be watching the Andean scenery float past on this superb journey. It was one of the most memorable days we have had on our travels and a must do on your bucket list."

But the Andean Explorer is a joy if you take a book, a pack of cards and put yourself into the right gear.The website gives you a pretty decent idea of what to expect. I would only add that:- They give you a lot more food than just lunch- The sophisticated pictures of the train on the website are spot on\u2026. Except you need to replace the gorgeous Peruvian passenger models with assorted international tourists in leisure wear. Our train has one tour party of Australian seniors, complete with name badges. I would not have like to share a carriage with them but you can tune out your fellow passengers if you don\u2019t have a party in your carriage.- At times, the observation car is packed. Other times it\u2019s empty. Being in coach A (next to the observation car) is great as it allows you to pick your time. It is THE spot for photography (the back in open \u2013 no glass)- Pay attention to the advice from others to be in the observation car for Juliaca market. An incredible 15 minutes of people watching. Peru clearly has no translation for \u2018Health and Safety regulations\u2019.If you fly, you can probably shave 4-5 hours off the journey. So think of it as a 4-5 hour journey rather than 10."

Just got back from an epic, almost life changing trip to Peru during which my three children (20, 16 and 14), my wife and I experienced trekking over the Inca trail to Macchu Pichu. The 45+ km trail is demanding but very rewarding.What better than to sit comfortably on a luxurious train for an entire day after such a trek? From 8am to 6pm, the train took us from Cusco to Puno through mountains and meadows where Alpagas would roam freely. Each wagon's interior is covered in rich dark wood paneling and we sat on chairs that belonged more to a living room than a train. We were facing each other, separated by a table covered with white linen, a table lamp and a flower vase with a fresh cut rose in it. Very classy.We were served a pisco sour with a few amuse-bouche at around 10am. Then we were presented with a \"fashion show\" - very tacky - followed by live peruvian music performed by a fun and friendly group of musicians. The train then stopped at the highest point of the day - 4319 metres - where we got off the train to visit a small and lovely church and shop at the artisans' market. Make sure you carry soles (local currency) with you as we found better quality wool products at better prices there than about anywhere else in the country. Time is short, but you can make some great buys.Bck on the train, we were then served a 3-course lunch. While the food wasn't exactly perfect, the service, attention and presentation were impressive. They work hard to make you feel like you are very special. During the afternoon, another music show and a short demonstration on how to make a good pisco sour were presented in the bar wagon which doubles into the panoramic one. Being the last wagon on the train, the open balcony with brass railing at the very back of the train is the best place to take pictures of the constantly evolving scenery.Later in the afternoon was tea time with yet again a few bites to complement the hot tea.While the train is much more expensive that the bus alternative, we found that it was a great way to recover from 4 demanding days on the mountains and the quality of service we received throughout the day in a setting that could easily make anyone feel they have gone back 100 years in time was simply delightful.If you plan on traveling between those two cities and want to experience what the Orient Express might have been like, the Andean Explorer is simply a must."

You also have access to a lovely bar area with comfy arm chairs and occasional tables, laid with a single rose which, serves a good selection of drinks, cocktails and hot beverages. There is also an observation carriage with seats and an open balcony at the back. The food served throughout the duration was quite a surprise, we had breakfast, lunch, served with wine and afternoon tea, served with a champagne bellini and it was absolutely superb.

Cusco to Puno is cheaper by bus.... but it is nowhere near as indulgent!This train is run by the same company that runs the Orient Express in Europe and it shows, service (Ingrid) was impeccable, food excellent - just how they manage this quality on trains is beyond me.My photos show the food and the seating style but they cannot do justice to the service and the ambiance.The rear car is a large open veranda to the bar. The photo opportunities are excellent if it is not too crowded, my tip is to get there early.The bar area has a number of Peruvian dress/dance fashion shows during the trip and it has live music. On my journey a group of Australians steered the music from traditional Peruvian to a sing along - OK if you wanted that sort of stuff - I returned to my seat and enjoyed the scenery - added bonus was the dancers passed through my carriage so I could get better photos than in the bar!The train stops at the highest point of the line - 4319m - and there is a small street market and a great opportunity for photos.Finally arrival in Puno is in the dark.Decide on hand luggage to take with you as the bulk is stored for the duration of the trip, but it seemed to be well looked after and all divided you by carriage number to collect at the end. Again service was key to a VERY enjoyable trip - pay the extra and go by train."

Breakfast is available on board (small muesli and fresh fruit), which you can supplement if you like. Soft drinks available all day. Pisco Sour at 10:30am - if you are up to it.

The style and service was a refreshing contrast to the other options for travel in the Puno region. The food service was really great in terms of quality, freshness and presentation, and the refreshments just kept coming.The on board entertainment has been carefully thought out and made the time pass very quickly.As we were on honeymoon, the staff provided complimentary champagne which really made the trip special."

Brilliant scenery, excellent service and a great atmosphere.However, when you travel from Cuzco to Puno the really interesting scenery is in the first half and the second stage drags a bit. Going through Juliaca was crazy....make sure you are in the observation carThe whole atmosphere is great. The chairs look good but by the end you could use a recliner.If we were to do it again we would go from Puno rather than to Puno"

The landscape you pass through though is very impressive, and the train experience lovely and make the 10 hours pass quite quickly. The only downside we experienced was that something they served us for lunch (I think it was the chicken) did not sit well with our stomachs."

It was a nice experience for about 5-6 hours. but 10-11 hours for 400 km is just too much. I couldn't get it out of my mind that the train was deliberately going slow to prolong the trip. It was very expensive per kilometer of travel. The train was comfortable and the staff seemed attentive and we got to see gorgeous views. I wished the train would have moved faster and stopped a couple more times. Just some extra advice for planning this journey (DO NOT fly out of Juliaca):If you do take the train form Cusco to Puno, you can take it 1 way. However, based on personal experience, do NOT fly out of Juliaca. The day we left, there was a strike in Juliaca, The people in Juliaca blockaded the streets with glass /burning tires and made their roads impassable. Our driver got us to the airport after 2 hours of nerve wrecking travel through the back/shanty town streets. The streets were unpaved, and gory. We were afraid of driving into a mob and the driver was clearly worried at the van being stoned (or worse). We were all worried that the tires would be punctured and we would be stranded in Juliaca. It is much better and ( i believe safer) to take an extra to see Arequipa and then fly out. I am not going to comment on the politics of Juliaca, but the town is clearly run down and not well maintained. "

The service was excellent and we enjoyed very much the outsideplatform of the last car. The landscape during the trip is so beautiful. The 10 hours past really quickly.We bought a backpacker ticket (169 US Dollar) and I was very surprised that all the food was included except the coffee at the bar in the panorama car. This journey was one of my Peruvian highlights. I generally like to go by train and was therefore very interested in it instead of taking a bus. I can highly recommended it.Arriving in Cusco please keep an eye on overpriced taxi drivers. We paid more than double of the \"right\" price."

In the spirit of the Orient Express, we took the luxurious Andean Explorer to Cusco. Often referred to as one of the best train journeys of the world, the ten hour journey took us through spectacular changing landscapes passing steppes, nomadic tribes, deep gorges shouldering the river alongside the railway line and snow-capped mountains towering above us the whole way. It turned out to be one of our highlights on our trip.The day was about the journey, not the destination. With plush surroundings and an army of meticulously dressed waiters, our every need was met as we slowly chugged through a fascinating and everchanging landscape. There was so much to see and photograph!A tip \u2013 be at the back of the train on the viewing platform as you leave Juliaca. Our train slowly moved through a busy market that occupies the narrow space between the tracks and the buildings that back on to the line. From the outside observatory we got a great view of the various stalls and watched with interest how the stall holders abandoned their market between the tracks, then quickly restored their stalls over the tracks once the train moved through! Terrific photo opportunities."

This is a great option to relax in luxury while making your trip to Cusco or Puno. It is certainly not the fastest way (Train probably averages around 35-40 km/h) but it's all about the journey. Miles and miles of fabulous countryside to view. The open air observation platform is a great way to view the scenery. The entertainment is very good. ( Two different bands played.)

Ok, its a little expensive, but so much better than getting a coach or plane between the 2 locations, Its an activity in itself. The trip includes food and drink, there is an observation car and bar car where you are free to sit or stand at the back of the train watching the world go by They alsos put on eg peruvian music and do things like pisco sour cocktail demos. Overall, really worth it, and great watching the scenary go by, Tip- stand in the observation car when going through Julianca and watch all the street traders putting back their stalls over the train track as soon as the train passes ! Amazing day, it is well worth it and does represent value for money."

From the outside it looks nothing special (apart from its rather fine blue and yellow livery) but inside is a completely different story. The carriages are simply stunning - fine wood panelling, antique wall lamps and lamps on each table. The individual chairs are high backed and comfortable; we had single seats opposite each other. The washroom in each carriage was equally grand and clean with soap and hand lotion. As if that was not enough, there was a bar with lounge seats and tables and an observation car (with an outdoor viewing platform) at the back. Once again, beautiful wood panelling, comfortable seats and gleaming brass fittings were the order of the day. Soon after we left Puno we were offered tea, coffee, etc and muesli with fresh fruit. We were then asked to choose from two starters and two mains for lunch with a single dessert to follow. Lunch included a complementary glass of wine and coffee. In the afternoon we were offered a Bellini before being served afternoon tea. Additional drinks were available throughout the day at extra cost. Everything was served 'silver service' with immaculate attention to detail by the friendly and helpful staff. Other entertainment on the trip included two separate bands performing live traditional music, an exhibition of traditional dances and a fashion show! To cap it all, the train stopped at the highest point on the trip so that we could take photos of the mountains and look round the market that was there. A great journey in sheer luxury."

Between meals, there is live entertainment available in the bar car which takes the form of local musicians playing traditional Peruvian music with dancing as well \u2013 there are different groups in the morning and afternoon. There was also a fashion show on the trip we made and a lesson on how to make Pisco Sours (the \u2018National Cocktail\u2019 of Peru). All the entertainment is of high quality and is worth seeing, although you can choose to remain in your seat if you want to.There is also a stop at about the halfway point of the journey to buy souvenirs from local people selling traditional handicraft products.At the very rear of the train is an area that is open at the back which can be used as a photography platform \u2013 you will want to this use at several points along the way. The views across mountains, rivers and plains are spectacular for much of the journey.Staff are courteous and friendly and provide excellent service.This train represents considerably better value than the Hiram Bingham train, being roughly half the price for a much longer trip with the same standard of d\u00e9cor on the train and almost the same (very high) standard of food. If your trip includes a trip to Machu Picchu and Lake Titicaca, the this is an excellent way to get from \u2018A\u2019 to \u2018B\u2019, via Cusco and Puna."

Beautiful scenery of majestic mountains and rivers, passing by little towns where you could get a glimpse of town's life, live entertainment and beautiful food on white linen! The workers and kids in each town would drop everything to wave at you when the train passes by. Some towns would even centre their market along the rail with stalls literally by the rail lines. Quite a sight. Lots to see and do, unless you want to nap which is of course possible. Food and drinks were excellent, served inside bygone era carriages. What a treat! This is not to be confused with the Vistadome train trip to the base of Machu Picchu and back. That was also a lot of fun but a relatively shorter ride in a very different train."

We travelled from Puno to Cusco and whilst check in was a long snaking line out the door, we were processed quickly and on board a lovely wagon with large armchairs instead of the usual train seats. I was able to change to a more comfortable setting with just us 2 opposite one another and if you don't like travelling backwards it is wise to request a forward sitting place in advance. Service was excellent, food was terrific, entertainment was accomplished in a cramped area - how the dancers and musician did it, I don't know! There were stops along the way which were very welcome. The one criticism I have is the heat and lack of ventilation. There were a few ill people who suffered and I also found it suffocating with only a small sliding window at the top for a little air. No air conditioning or fans! Incredible oversight.The observation car was crowded and it seemed every time I tried to get air out there, they released the toilets so the stink was awful (other people mentioned this also) so being out there was no relief. We met people later who had come up with the luxury bus and said it was great with regular stops etc so you have to decide which option will suit you better.Through no fault of the train's, we were held up just outside Cusco and had to shunt another train that had broken down in front of us so we were very late arriving and after such a long hot journey, it didn't come a moment too soon.

I've taken several train rides in Europe, but this one may have them all beat simply due to the scenery. The music playing over the speakers was a bit cliched and repetitive, but peaceful nonetheless. The ride back down - after we'd conquered Machu Picchu - featured a fashion show on the train, during which a man dressed like a goblin would dance around while trying to get women to dance with him.

You can purchase the ticket on line yourself or you can have a travel agent do it for you. The seats are rather roomy, or at least for a tiny person like me, but compare to any British trains it is, and not too back with Amtrak or Eurostar...etc. There is an observation carriage at the end of the train where the bar is and where there is open space you can take photos. There is free entertainment on board, with some traditional dance and so called fashion show, where they try to sell you products. The food and drinks are not free so you will have to settle the bill just before you get to Puno. Rather pricey, but it is good. I am glad I did not pass up the opportunity to take the coach instead, this is a great way to travel. However, just be sure you have luggage allowance and if you carry more then you have to pay ....."

The whole train is devoted to making the 10 hours onboard a memorable one. If viewing the soaring Andes as you glide by is not enough then there is a stop to stretch your legs, a delicious lunch and other snacks/drinks. Then there is entertainment with local musicians, dancing and even a Pisco sour lesson. The time flies. Service is excellent and staff engaged. Only strange thing (very small) is that if you want milk in your tea or coffee then there is an extra charge for it. Very strange in what is a first class event. You should also consider carefully what you do at the other end - Puno (a grubby town with only very touristy islands to offer). However this is another story - the Andean Explorer is enough in itself."

We enjoyed the sit back and relax kind of atmosphere, looking out large windows at the changing scenery - grabbing photos of whatever took our fancy (try doing that on a plane!). The meals were very pleasant and the service was friendly and efficient. There was some on-board entertainment in the lounge throughout the journey - though we chose just to relax, take a snooze, read and generally enjoy the quiet and absorb the fabulous scenery.This train trip made a very pleasant alternative to the frantic pace of flying - the train station in Puno was quite relaxed with some local Andean entertainment provided to while away the time waiting for the train to depart.We would thoroughly recommend the Andean Explorer for its service, ambience and comfort. A great way to see the land from Puno to Cusco without the hassle of having to drive yourself."

Food was good, considering it was served on a train. Lots of attention to details. They spread out entertainment throughout the day, and the observation deck was great to stretch the legs and watch the day go by. One tip, head to the back of the train as soon as morning tea is finished. We did and were spoilt with the view of going through a market which is set over the train track. The sellers grab their goods, umbrellas to move out of to the trains way as it goes through and then put everything back straight away. Some even leave things in the train track for the train to roll over the top. Lots of locals also stop and wave as the train comes past. You get lots of smiles as you wave back."

The trains were clean and the staff were friendly and helpful.Most noteable however, was the service provided by the Aguas Calientes Perurail director, Arnaldo Ponce De Leon. Our tour operator had mistakenly booked our train to Cusco for November 28 instead of December 28th and when we got to the station in Aguas Calientes we learned that there were no spots on any Perurail train for the next 4 days. While this was a problem, the bigger problem was that we were scheduled to leave Peru in 3 days. We then met Arnaldo who worked tirelessly to find us 4 seats on a later train where there were a few no shows. I should point out that there were 2 other families who were in similar perdicaments and Arnaoldo was able to help them out as well. Arnaldo literally saved our vacation and for this we cannot thank him enough!"

I'd like to hear something about that from Perurail. Sorry but half the people wont probably even need a snack,a drink, service and overpayed tourist books if that cuts the price alot. You already have 2 types of trains with a good service. At least make the cheapest train alot cheaper. Remove all the service and give the backpacker and budget travellers what they want.

Bought the ticket for this early November 15:35 Vistadom train from Ollantaytambo to Aguas Calientes just a half hour before-hand at the Olly trainstation ticket office. The left side has the best views by far traveling from Olly--> AC. Each train car has a toilet and we were given a nice snack and soft drink. It was just like an airline flight with at least 3 attendants. Yes, tickets ARE expensive.For the return Aguas Calientes to Ollantaytambo route we bought the tickets online a few MONTHS in advance for the 18:35 Expedition train as we had heard that trains departing AC tend to be busier - and were glad we did as it sold out a few days after we purchased them. The Peru rail waiting room in AC is just okay and in the late afternoon / evening is packed with very loud people (tourists) catching trains out of AC. There is only one attendant on the train car but the drink and snack was free. Luggage could be brought aboard. There were lot's of back packers. The train seemed to be more rocky then when we went the other way but maybe b/c we were coming down compared to climbing up, I don't know. If you can afford the difference then the Vistadom service is the way to go - in my humble opinion."

I've read other reviews here saying this company and IncaRail are monopolies, and it definitely seems to be that way, I should have read up on it before I went to explore other options. The service itself was fine, there were drinks served on shorter route from Ollanta to Aguas, and then a full meal service (I guess I'd call it a snack, it was just a little empanada and a cookie) on the longer route from Aguas to Cusco. It just seemed way too expensive when a 5 hour bus ride in Peru costs $20, again back to the monopoly issue, there might not be any other choices than these rails so you'll get stuck with whatever they charge you."

Booking the ticket at the office in Cusco was not a smooth process either. The ticket seller managed to book the wrong train, input the wrong passport details and then charged too little on my credit card making me pay an additional charge by cash. I took the vistadome to Machu Picchu which left at 08:25. It was already quite warm at this time and the air-conditioning barely seemed to work and alternated between too cold and too hot. I requested a window seat and even though two were available, they did not allow me to change seat. Of course with all the glass around the views are not too bad even on the aisle seat, but it does make photography a lot harder. The background music is a bit too loud and incredibly irritating. The meal provided was 3 cold mini-pancakes, 2 strawberries, 1 small banana and a warm mini spinach quiche. Also consider wearing sunscreen and a hat etc since the sun is quite strong with all the glass windows on the roof. On the return I took the expedition train, which seemed very similar inside, also with poor air conditioning. They provided one free refreshment and a bun or muffin. Same irritating music throughout. Overall the service was unfriendly with one or two staff members making an exception and genuinely trying to interact with passengers. Considering that this is a foreign investment and that most income probably leaves the country, it is quite appalling."

Well presented, tasty Peruvian food was served a few times during the journey, accompanied by fine wine and champagne. Peruvian musicians and dancers entertained the travellers in the last wagon of the train, which also served as a viewing gallery for those wanting to watch the ever changing,diverse scenery. The train stopped a couple of times along the way, letting us visit a small church and a local arts and crafts market. The journey was very long, lasting nearly 12 hours,but I chose this mode of travel for its charm and the fascinating outside scenery. The length of time that it took to reach the final destination became only a \"moment in time\" when compared to the lasting memories of the overall experience."

It is a 3hr ride and a roundtrip ticket cost as much as my one way plane fare from Lima to Cusco. They say that you must be there 30 mins in advance and there is absolutely no reason for this. The station was packed, we stood around simply waiting to board and for no good reason. There was not anyone there to direct us so we stood outside in a line to speak to the person in the booth because we thought we needed a ticket in exchange for our email ticket but this was not the case....and no one told us, we simply got tired of waiting in the line.Once the boarding started, it went quickly, have your passport ready for inspection along with the email ticket that you rec'vd. Seating is really cramped as you are seated in a 4 top. a table divides you from the 2 people across from you, but it is difficult to stretch out your legs as you kick the person in front of you.The snack that they give you is nice. I like the attention to detail that they offer. They set the table including a little cactus for decoration; I thought that was a nice touch. The breakfast was good, the meals are vegetarian. Coming back, it was the same bottle neck situation with having to be at the station for 30 mins in advance again without a clear purpose. In the evening, you also get a hot snack, vegetarian which was also good. They provided entertainment, a dancer and then a fashion show. I understand why they would want to entertain the guest, but after hiking all day and having such an early morning, you simply want to sleep on the way back. I actually made out better as i had a 2 seater on the way back so I was able to stretch out my legs.the rail attendants were professional and courteous, the appearance of the cars were nice and clean.p.s. get your entrance ticket to Machu Picchu first, then get your rail ticket. I did the reverse, couldn't get a ticket to Machu Picchu on the same day of the rail ticket as they sold out, then had to pay a penalty to Perurail to change my ticket to go the next day. I was not happy about the 10% penalty. I could see if it was at the last minute, but it was weeks before I was due to travel."

It is poorly laid and there seems to be a maintenance problem too. The tracks are held to the sleepers by bolts either side of the track and not in shoes and clips as you find in Europe. The joints have worn badly making for a rough transition between rails. During the descent from Poroy, the train jerks and rocks a lot making it quite uncomfortable. While on the return to Poroy, the carriages and linkages are in tension making the ride far more comfortable.Surely with the popularity of this line and high passenger numbers, more money could be spent on improvement."

These days we do, which is why I was somewhat bemused to find myself in a museum piece rattling along at a speed more usually associated with a bicycle.You have to like trains and if you do, you'll love this. The food is authentic - tasteless, cold and interminable. The carriage is very comfortable but after 10 hours of the same inane conversation over the aisle, I longed for the roar of a couple of PW4000 engines to drown it out. The scenery is remarkably flat for the Andes - the train to Aguas Calientes has far better views (if even worse food) but there was more in the way of electricity transmission. You also have to like train horns which the driver activated, for no apparent reason, once every 8 seconds on average.However, it looks fantastic and if you like this type of thing, you'll be thinking 'trip of a lifetime'. You already know where this reviewer stands on that."

They clear your used dishes so much quicker than any airline I have flown with and I had 12 flights on this trip alone. The food is of a reasonable standard and enough of it with the snacks as well as lunch. Also a champagne drink near arrival was refreshing. There is enough entertainment like musicians, a dancing lady and parade of Peruvian scarfs etc in the back vista dome carriage if you wish to attend and there is a bar there to enjoy a drink whilst being entertained.The day we travelled a truck had fallen onto the lines and we had quite a delay to wait to have it removed making the trip 12 hours before arriving in Puno but it still went without boredom.Service to your seat is available throughout the trip. Would be interesting to know how far the staff walk in one trip as they are back and forth constantly and keep a smile on their faces.A 10 minute stop at the highest peak station to see a Church and buy some local crafted goods was a break to enjoy.

The train's fit out is lovely, the scenery amazing (note: you'd get the same if you opted for the bus, the road and train line are adjacent) and travelling by train is just a nice way to go, but given that the Andean Explorer is billed as a luxury trip my experience fell short.Firstly we were hassled for a tip by a baggage guy in Cuzco. Not a subtle smile or hand out, but he followed us, through the very nice lounge and onto the platform, calling out 'Tiiiip! Tiiiiiip!!' (we didn't even know he was talking to us, we'd just handed the bag to him at the bag drop) eventually catching up and tapping me on the arm until we essentially paid him to go away. Not a nice way to start the trip.Then there's the wait staff on board who, although plentiful, were just a bit slow to react - 20min for a coffee? Compared to the responsive and seemingly very happy guys servicing our carriage on Peru Rail's Expedition service to Machu Picchu, the servers on our Andean Explorer were a bit of a let down. Not rude, but sub par.Re the food, it's fine, but nothing to write home about. They've obviously tried very hard to create a menu of a certain standard, but perhaps the KISS principle would be well-employed here.Obviously a rating is a function of expectation, the actual experience and perceived value at the price. Three out if five stars isn't terrible, but I'm not sure I'd go again.Should you go if you haven't been? If it's not going to break the bank, absolutely! But here are my suggestions:- ask to sit on the north-east side of the train, it seems to have the better views- if you're a twosome, ask to sit at a table for two. You might get lucky and share with a really nice couple, but it's a 10hr trip if you don't..- take noise cancelling headphones, the muzak is relentlessI hope this info helps someone else to get the most out of their Andean Explorer journey :)"

The entertainment on board and access to the observation car at the back of the train, make this 10 hour journey feel really, really short. Apart from the spectacular scenery, it's incredible how the train goes straight through the middle of a few towns that you pass through. Because the train only runs certain days of the week, the locals have their market stalls over the tracks and quickly pack them up when they hear the train approaching, and as you go through they start packing them back on the rails. In all, absolutely fascinating - well done Peru Rail on a truly amazing experience. The friendly train staff even helped us hail a taxi in Puno to make sure that we were not going to be ripped off.

The trip is a very long one, being about 10 hours, climbing of the mountains.The train stops at its highest point at a local market which is a good break fro the trip and shows some local culture.The staff on the train are brilliant. Not only providing your food and services, but also putting on a fashion show and also providing entertainment. A very good concept."

The train leaves from the southern station in Cusco to musical accompaniment and works its way through Cusco and along a river valley. The best seats are on the left of the train but if you aren't sitting there just go to the back of the train where the observation car gives you brilliant views. There is plenty to eat and drink on board as well as musical entertainment and a demonstration of the making of Pisco sours. You leave early and get into Puno late (about 8 pm) but there are lots to see along the way with the climax being the trip through the market at Juliaca. If you can, go to the observation car and watch from the rear of the train."

Linen tablecloths, gratis Pisco sours at 11 AM, menu choices and wine for lunch, frequent snacks, a bar car, and intermittent entertainment by a Peruvian musical group playing native songs. The slow moving train skirts Lake Titicaca's marshes, goes through farmland, passes people doing laundry in the river, snakes very slowly between bazaar stalls in small towns, gradually climbs in to the snow capped Andes, stopping at its highest altitude for pictures and bartering with locals over handcrafts. Beware - tour groups abound with bossy guides, evident when boarding and getting your luggage at the end. The railway staff are professional and courteous. The man selling tickets in Puno was outstanding; when we realized we'd left something at our hotel, he called there, translated our problem to them, and waved me off to catch the train having solved our issue."

I love being on a train and the romance of this kind of travel but my experience on this journey fell short of rail I've been on in Europe, US, Asia and India using regular train lines. I felt lucky getting tickets on short notice for my wife's birthday and spent a lot of time building the experience up based on the many reviews and marketing online I've read. This is described as \"One of the world's great train experiences\". It is interesting, but it isn't what a lot of reviews here describe. First, it isn't really a \"luxury\" experience. The train is clean and interesting, but it doesn't feel like \"old world\" decor or atmosphere. I would compare it to first class on British rail or Amtrak in the US. The seats are comfortable, but look nicer online than they really were. The food is presented very well, but it is in very, very small portions (breakfast was probably 60g - no exaggerating) Lunch was extremely bland and the potatoes were so dry they could choke you. You pay for every drink other than tea - even water. We heard others around us complaining about the food service as well.The main attraction is the views through the Andes. For the first hour or two it is quite nice but for the remaining 8 hours you see a lot of flat, mostly barren landscape with few mountains. The towns you travel through are fascinating - watching bustling markets and crowded living gives you a feel for real-life in Peru. Honestly the pedestrian train from Cusco or Ollantaytambo is much, much more beautiful; green, mountains, Sacred River alongside. The staff were very pleasant and professional. They were really trying. Having fashion shows through the cabins to get you to buy alpaca goods you will undoubtedly see *everywhere* you go in Peru was a bit tired. The shows in the bar car were OK - but designed to sell you a CD full of covers of Simon and Garfunkel in pan flute.Perhaps I've done too many other rail trips to feel as positive as others. This is a worthwhile trip and a MUCH more comfortable way to travel to Lake Titicaca than the bus. It isn't a luxury trip and it isn't a \"unforgettable journey through the land of the Incas\". It is just a nice commuting train. It pains me to say that as I love being on long train rides, but this slow trek is simply \"better than the bus\".The train ride to Aguas Cliente is a digestible 2 hours from Ollantaytambo; is run by Peru Rail also; has much, much more spectacular views; has great service and staff. This is a cheaper alternative, likely on your itinerary anyway, the seats are just as good, the cars have the same kind of view windowsWe are glad we did it, but it is disappointing."

First up there are not too many train rides at this altitude, reaching 4,300m at one point and stopping so you can get pictures with an altitude sign. The average spread for the trip is about 25km/h so it's no rocket and just as well because it rattles and shakes a lot. The fit out is comfortable the seats being very much like large armchairs. Despite the 10 plus hours the journey was not boring for me. There is the scenery including snow capped mountains and vast rural pursuits from crops to herds of live stock which contrast against baron treeless mountains. But onboard things do happen. There is traditional music and dancing and a fashion parade of sorts, aimed at selling. The is a welcome pisco sour and a glass of wine with lunch plus a farewell drink all part of the deal and you can buy more. Nothing happens quickly with morning and afternoon tea plus lunch taking up few hours. It is a bit of a pity the train gets in when it is dark, it is so much easier to get your bearings in daylight and it would not take much to shave an hour or so off the journey time. All up a good experience and if you are not into unique trains rides there is always the bus."

The first hint that this is something really special is the view of the staff and the carriages from the waiting room at Cusco. The staff are dressed impeccably and the train is presented beautifully. Shades of the Orient Express! Boarding the train is breathtaking. One almost expects to see Hercule Poirot at a table laid with linen and silver, sipping a glass of an excellent red wine. The numerous dining events (not just meals!) are the stuff of movies. This is ten hours of heaven in gleaming brass and wood panelling on steel wheels. The train travels at a leisurely pace, so as to provide a gliding panorama of life on the Alto Plano, the high plateau of the Andes. The seating is wingback armchairs, perfectly upholstered for a lengthy relaxing journey. Even though the local children must see this train pass twice a day they are jumping with excitement and smile and wave as the tourists float by. The rear observation car is a truly unique treasure, for both conversation, hospitality and stretching the legs. At this Spring season we were delighted by snow falling on us at our stop at La Raya, the highest point of the line at 4319 metres, then twice entranced by the spectacle of 'phantom falls', where cloud cascades down mountain sides as it flows from one valley to the next. The staff complete the show with a fashion parade, wearing the luxurious fabrics of legendary baby alpaca. That includes the males of the staff too! The only jarring point was the dress-up masked bogey-men, apparently a feature of the Inca religion that pervades the region. The grand finale is to watch Lake Titcaca glide into view and glow in the setting sun and moonlight."

The were several tables that they sit 4 people at, and if you don't like the other people it would really stink to be stuck with them for 10 hours!

We saw everything from barber shops, food, housewares. People smiling and waving. Also loved the mountain passes- spectacular. At the peak (4310 meters) it was interesting that all the riders became quiet (and dusky coloured) but the lively conversation returned once we got lower. Good entertainment. One comment- SLOW. Took 10 hours. When we were along side of the road we were getting passed by dump trucks. This would have been a perfect 8 hour trip going faster but alas I don't think the tracks could support."

The tickets were emailed to us and said 'depart Cusco', we didn't know that there were two stations in Cusco and even though we were an hour early to the station, we didn't realise we were in the wrong place until it was too late and we missed the departing train. We spent the next three and a half hours in a taxi and $90 USD trying to get in front of the train to board it. This experience was the most stressful part of our entire trip. The staff from Peru Rail did everything they could to help us, they got us in a taxi and told the driver what needed to happen, he didn't speak English and we don't speak Spanish, the taxi driver and the rail staff kept in contact via mobile phone and organised a catch up point, we missed the first one due to road works, traffic jambs and speed bumps in every small town. We finally made the second catch up point with ten minutes to spare, even after being pulled over by the police and them confiscating our taxi drivers licence. I think everyone was relieved that we finally boarded the train. Once on board the staff were extremely friendly and helpful and the rest of the trip went without any problems. My stress levels took quite some time to diminish though and I didn't enjoy the journey as much as I had hoped to. The food, scenery and staff were all good and I would recommend this train and Peru Rail, just be sure that your taxi driver in Cusco is taking you to the correct train station."

While the train ride is approximately ten hours long, passengers do not feel a minute of it due to the extreme planning and care given by the staff. One is greeted by a traditional musical group playing Andean music in the lobby of the train station prior to arrival. The train ride begins with a fashion show in the train's bar car. This is followed by two musical performances with traditional folkloric dancers from both the Cusco and Puno regions, and a lesson on how to make a pisco sour, which is coupled with the distribution of copious amounts of free pisco sours. For those with a love of photography, the final train car is an open air car that allows one to take amazing photographs of the Andean region or just sit and take in the beautiful scenery. The meals are freshly prepared on the train and they were very accommodating to my vegan diet. While the train ride is lovely and the staff is very kind, the high concentration of American and European tourists on board was disconcerting. Besides the staff, all of the passengers were foreigners. The very high ticket price prevents locals from having the opportunity to take advantage of such a trip. While I suppose it this is something to be expected for the cost, it made both my husband and I feel uncomfortable since we are not accustomed to traveling with so much luxury."

It takes around 6 hours by car and 11 hours by train as the train runs at 60km/h and there are sections where it goes even slower (particularly through little towns).Our journey took nearly 13 hours due to our having to wait about an hour for the train travelling in the opposite direction to pass (there is a section where the railway track is shared) and also due to heavy traffic in Juliaca.Yes the scenery is lovely but this is only fascinating for a few hours. They do provide some entertainment - Peruvian band + dancer (the Sunday market type who request tips when you do not purchase their CD) and a pretty awful fashion show where the model is one of the train staff.If you do not have much time to spare, definitely travel by car/bus or fly. You'll get to Cusco/Puno in nearly half the time which means more time spent at your destination."

But despite lots of things happening, it is definitely one of the highlights of our three weeks in Peru. One kilometre into the journey we derailed. It delayed us by a couple of hours whilst they found a digger to help us back onto the track. Later one of the door locks jammed, and the engineer had to come and repair it, and a little later one of the waiters dropped a tray load of drinks! And in the end we were two hours late.BUT - it's all worth it. The train is old-style luxury. Comfortable armchairs, excellent, if rather strange, food (although they don't heat the plates and so it isn't as hot as it could be). The observation car is a great place to see both the scenery and to observe life as we passed down a couple of streets filled with market stalls. Service was good, and we were given an additional plate of pasta before arriving into Cusco as we were running late.In the end we took 10 hours rather than 8, but our view was that this simply reduced the price to \u00a38.50 an hour rather than \u00a310!!"

We were rather excited about it the day beforehand and we have to admit that all our exceptations were met. The trip was just wonderful.The andean experience starts at check in where you are greeted by peruvian mucisians while the friendly staff went through check-in. Everything about check-in is smooth and quick including luggage handling.Then you board the train. The train is picked out of an old picture book, mahogany interior, art deco details, winged armchair, tablecoths, fresh roses, ... The lot.The train slowly makes its way out of Puno and then hits the Altiplano. Always at a pace of between 50 to 60 km, sometimes, unforeseen, stopping, which gives you a good possibilty to take the scenery in.Our guide adviced us to be in the vista waggon by the time the train crossed the city of Juliaca as the train would cross the market street. We shot some of the most beautiful pictures there. The train indeed cuts the market in two in a very narrow street. You can literally touch the goods from aboard the train. People sheer and wave at the train enthusiasticaly.After a light breakfast of coffee and muesli, in the bar waggon, there's a music show and complimentary pisco's before it's time for lunch. Now, in all honesty, apart from the experience of dining in such beautiful surroundings, the food is nothing special and neither is the tea and bellini's in the late afternoon. Then, that's not what it is all about I guess.The staff, without exception, is great. Some of them even showing some dance skills while the band is playing.At la Gaya, half way, the train stops. Here both trains interchange and outside there is a small market of weaving and knitting articles ... Ofcourse !Everywhere there's an interchange, the train needs to stop as tracks are changed manually. Be prepared for people selling their goods at the vista car. (These moments give you however equally the time to reflect how some of us can afford to travel like this and others need to live a life that is much harder ...)The train then makes it way to the ever more dramatic scenery of the Andes, partly while the sun sets to reach Cusco in darkness. Turning the antique waggons into something extremely cosy.Nearlyeleven hours on a train, the old sound and rocking of the train on the rails, the horn to get people and animals of the track, ... Wonderfull and you would not at all have thought it took so long. If international flights could only have part of the charm and entertainment ...We were seated in waggon A, adjacent to the vista waggon, and from the constant passing of people and camera's to and from the vista waggon, I think I can say we were not the only ones that thought this experience to be great.We are looking forward to a similar experience from Cusco to Macchu Picchu on the Hiram Bingham Train in a few days"

Our seats were wooden wing back armchairs. We had a dining table with tablecloth, rose in a vase and a brass table lamp. All was dark, varnished wood, even in the luxurious loo. We left Puno promptly at 8 am. We were served a late breakfast, a decent lunch and afternoon tea. Tea, coffee and wine were served with the meals and everyone was given a complementary pisco sour. At the rear of the train the observation car was great as we could sit or stand and watch the Andean countryside pass by slowly, the average speed was around 25 mph. A slight annoyance was the inevitable pan pipes band and a truly dreadful 'fashion show' but overall the journey was good. Arriving in Cusco at around 7 pm we collected our luggage which had been carried in the luggage van and then laid out on the platform, all clearly and efficiently tagged and checked. A good, relaxing way to travel through the Peruvian countryside."

We had seats in the dining car and I was actually surprised by the level of service. The seats were luxurious and the food excellent. We had a light breakfast after departure and delicious lunch and afternoon tea later. Very high quality service and plenty to see during the trip, with ever-changing landscapes and views. The staff even gave a fashion show and a demonstration of the making of a perfect Pisco Sour cocktail - free samples too!!. There are a couple of stops on the way too, for those who like to shop for bargains like alpaca hats or sweaters.Travel by rail is a great way to see what's going on in a country and this one had an observation car at the rear so it was possible to get really good camera shots or just relax and take in the scenery. Wonderful and highly recommended."

I have been wanting to come to Peru most of my life and for my 50th it happened.We went from Puno to Cusco on the train and as teh train pulled out and started to go round the lake this is when my adventure came alive and I got a bit emotional!The train cannot be faulted - it is beautiful - all mahogany and brass (that includes the fab toilet!). we had a table for 2 which was perfect - romantic.We were recommended by our guide to get to the back of the observation car ready for when the train left the first stop - excellent advice. You go through a market on the tracks for almost 15 mins! It is great seeing everyone putting their stalls back now the train has passed! the scenery never stops amazing - from the lake views, to the high plateau and then coming down the valley getting more lush as you near Cusco.there is entertainment in the bar carriage if you want it but for us the scenery was all we wanted.The food and drink are fantastic - michellin quality. The service could not be faulted.By the end of the journey you are full from all the constant food being brought and a bit squiffy from the drink -perfect! DO NOT TRAVEL BETWEEN THESE CITIES ANY OTHER WAY!I would recommend this to anyone and it ranks up there with Machu Picchu. It brought tears to my eyes several times because it was so perfect. I can't speak too highly of it.Anyone interested in more detail, please contact me."

            "review": "Painfully slow, immensely uncomfortable, rediculously overpriced. Took this train from Cusco to Puno. Started off with having to wait in waiting room that only had enough chairs for a small fraction of the passengers there. Had to sit on uncomfortable armchairs. A fellow passenger recieved multiple insect bites, most likely from the chair. I went into observation car at one stage & a child ran after the train for a bit - this was possible for the child as the train was so slow. The child then threw a rock into the train, via the open back deck, narrowly missing a passengers arm then a glass window. Although the child should not have done this, it is understandable given this train travels through towns, right in front of the locals homes, it is noisy & dangerous and this must be annoying for them. Also, they see what would appear to them to be well-healed, pampered tourists travelling along in apparent luxury that they have no access to. But the luxury is apparent, it is anything but luxurious. As I have said, the chairs are uncomfortable.The ride is known to be a bone shaker. The food is disgusting & the meal services lasted for hours. From the time the cutlery was first brought out until the end of the 'meal' was several hours. All of the food was stone cold when it arrived. The food was so dry it was difficult to eat. The portions were tiny which given the poor quality of the food was probably a blessing. The scenery was not great but I cannot blame the train company for that, however, it meant there was nothing worth looking at to pass the long, slow hours away. We were only 20 minutes late getting to Puno so we were among the lucky passengers. It seems it can be many hours late.My advise it book the bus - a fraction of the price, hours quicker, goes along almost the same route as the train & stops in a few places so you see more. I have never been on a bus as uncomfortable as that train so the bus is most likely to most comfortable option as well."

Meals are served with china and real silverware; alcohol is available. There is a really cool observation car at the back where you can take pictures.

Portions were perfect for us, though additional menu items are also available at extra cost. The club/observation car offers great views of the countryside as the train climbs out of Cusco and over the Andes, along with music, a fashion show and a performace by dancers in traditional Peruvian costumes. We booked through Llamapath, and they can provide transportation to and from the train stations (at both ends). That really simplifies your life, especially if you are running late in the morning (savoring the hotel breakfast), and since the train arrives in Puno after dark (about a 10-hour trip)."

A few times the servers slammed into them and dropped glasses which pieces got cleaned up 1/2 hour later. In short - they try some more than others but service could be better.

Right from the start we were having fun, dancing or tasting pisco sours. It was an incredible social experience where we got to know most of our fellow travellers from diverse backgrounds, Peru, Brazil, Spain, Japan, USA etc. (wonderful). 2 days later, bumping into a fellow passenger, all we could talk about was the train journey. Staff were cheerful and friendly and gave the impression they were having fun too. Food was excellent, more than we expected.Journey did go over time by 30 minutes and I can understand other travellers becoming frustrated if it was delayed any longer. Once it becomes dark there is little to provide interest. My only recommendation would be to provide warning if going over time and perhaps another activity if this happens."

I booked easily on line, but then realized our four seats weren't together. I emailed Peru Rail and was immediately re-issued four seats at the same table. We arrive at the train station about 40 minutes prior to departure (they tell you to be there at least 30 minutes before). We checked in quickly with a gentleman in the waiting room and were then entertained as we waited by a four person local Peruvian band.All guests are assigned a table in the dining car. It's a throw back to the old days of train travel....elegant and comfortable, with table clothes and comfy wingback chairs. There is a separate bar car and viewing / observation car. Bathrooms are large and spotless with granite counter tops. Once on board I asked for coffee and it was delivered quickly (good coffee as well). We were then given a menu and made our lunch selection and drink orders were taken. Not long after we departed we went to the bar cart for musical entertainment (combined with an early morning gin and tonic of course). There was also afternoon entertainment (another band and a fashion show). Lunch was very good and they came around a couple of times with complimentary wine. There was also wine to purchase and we enjoyed a nice bottle as we whiled away the afternoon. I had brought my e-reader with me thinking I would have a ton of time to read during the ten hours.....but I found the scenery and ambience too distracting to read. I was back and forth to the viewing car which allows for stunning photos. The scenery was ever changing and I defy anyone to say they were bored. Service was excellent throughout the day and it just made for a truly memorable way to get from Puno to Cusco.If you are even debating taking this train ride, do not hesitate. The four of us talked about this experience long after we disembarked. Truly a highlight of our trip. Great job Peru Rail!!!!"

Comfortable armchairs adore each carriage. The last carriage is the viewing platform with lots of standing and seating space. Great to watch the landscape pass by from the rear. Also makes for lovely photos. The there is the fun or entertainment carriage (has the bar in it) and is also where the on board entertainment takes place during the journey. The staff are so lovely and so friendly. The band and entertainment were just awesome. 11hour was by no means a hardship at all on this train. So worth the it...enjoyed every minute. Food was amazing too..."

The staff on board we attentive and fun. The food was excellent and the vistas from the train second to none. Although there was entertainment during the 10 hour trip, we found the scenery and the views of everyday life as the train went by to be entertainment enough.This train like other Peru Rail trains that we took during our trip ran on time and was sparklingly clean. In my opinion it was also excellent value for money. I would recommend everyone travelling to Cusco and Puno to consider this mode of transport rather than flying or driving."

I am a train lover and I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of the 10 hour journey on the Andean Explorer from Cusco to Puno on Lake Titicaca. We were welcomed on board by attentive staff and the in-train band playing music on the platform. We spent the time appreciating the beautiful vistas from the observation car, where we were offered a complimentary Pisco Sour, or from our seats. We listened to live Peruvian music from the in-train band. We watched some dancing and a fashion show of Peruvian knit wear. We feasted on two delicious meals served by the most attentive servers. We also enjoyed the company of our friendly neighbours on the train and exchanged travel stories with them. We had a quick stop about half way where we could stretch our legs and visit a market, We also had time to read and have a little snooze.Travelling right down the middle of the extensive market of Juliaca after a huge rain offered a glimpse of Peruvian life most tourists wouldn't normally see.I was amazed when we arrived at our destination in Puno because we were dropped off at our hotel from the train (Casa Andina Private Collection) and were met by hotel staff to help us with our bags.The whole trip was reminiscent of a charming long-forgotten train era and it felt great to have lived that experience!"

It was a ten hour journey, in a charming train which minded us of the Orient Express. The food and service was great and the small amount of entertainment was just enough. We spent most of our time in the rear viewing carriage which was perfect. The speed was slow enough to appreciate the landscape and take some time out of a packed schedule to really see the country. Highly recommended and anyone that suggests it is too slow are missing the point spectacularly!! A \"must do\" and worth every penny."

Initially I was worried about the 10 hour trip ahead of us, wondering what we'd do to pass the time, however it was a pleasure to spend it on the train and it reminded me of being back on the Orient Express. Staff were very attentive, food was great (even catering for special diets), entertainment in the form of pan-piped music, dancing and complimentary pisco sours helped to while away the time and we all arrived to Puno with a smile on our faces. The rear carriage is a car-bar outdoor observatory for which you can admire the stunning scenery and when we reached the city of Juliaca we stood in this car amazed at the most incredible market that we were travelling through, literally selling everything and anything, and sited both sides of the track and actually on the track in places! Has to be seen to be believed! I'd highly recommend the Andean Explorer and would definitely repeat the journey if ever in Peru again. Enjoy!"

There are cheaper ways of travelling from Cusco to Puno, quicker ways too, but if you get the opportunity to do this then take it.There were five coaches when we went early season, one for luggage, one for the kitchen, the bar and observation coach and then just two coaches for the actual passengers. You are sat in armchairs and your every need is catered for. We were constantly being fed and watered with exquisite cuisine and top class cocktails, with the bar there if ever you felt you were sobering up!The passing scenery is of course dramatic, but it was fascinating watching how it changed as we climbed towards Lake Titicaca.Two criticisms would be the cost of those drinks not included in the ticket, and the chaos in the baggage retrieval hall at the end of the journey."

The train ride is 10 hours from Cusco to Puno, and throughout the day we were treated to 1920's carriage, a delicious lunch, afternoon tea, music show and at the back an observation deck to enjoy the scenery. The 10 hours actually went by quickly unlike some of our bus rides. It was a great experience.However, my only complaint of our experience was the service. The staff whilst friendly, were not very attentive and when we asked for water (for a long trip like this people need to stay hydrated) they would walk off and forget. This was consistent throughout the day and was quite frustrating. We ordered drinks for lunch but they never came and when we asked we had to ask 4 times! Very disappointing since this is meant to be a luxury train. I think it would make sense for staff to walk through the carriage filling up water so people don't have to ask. There are plenty of restaurants that offer this. This is my only issue, other than that we had a lovely time."

The one-stop at La Raya at 14,100 feet above sea level was the highest altitude of our entire trip to Peru! The slow ride through the city of Juliaca was memorable in that you could reach out of the window(if you wanted to do this) and actually touch the shops along the tracks. That is how close some of the vendors had their shops alongside the train tracks. It was interesting to see that as soon as the train passed by, the vendors would immediately use the train track space for their \"shops.\" The entire trip was very informative and interesting - I would do it again."

The lunch service started just after 11.30am but dragged on for nearly 3 hrs. Plus all the food delivered was cold, cold soup,cold fish... This is unacceptable.Afternoon tea.... Was served at 5.45pm!!! Very late and several of the listed choices were not available.What worst is the train arrived late. Our carriage did not un load until nearly 7.00pm.The scenery becomes a bit boring after several hours and service on board made the journey seem even longer.Not a great experience !"

Train is the best option as allows you to move...see countryside not accessible by road...whilst doing it in style. Pisco sour at 10.30am is a great way to start a long train journey. Followed by 3 course lunch and afternoon tea with Bellini. The highlight for me was the last carriage with open back. Beautiful vista at every opportunity and surprisingly not too busy. For me a taste of the Orient Express and Britishness except not at those kind of prices!"

Seats are individual wing back chairs with large tables and brass lamps. There is also a bar car with a dome where there is live music with various local dances performed. There is also a fashion show and items can be purchased. Included in the ticket price were three meals. The morning snack was fresh fruit, yoghurt and granola. Lunch was a 3 course meal with several things to choose from. It came with a glass of wine. Afternoon tea included several sweets. The food was surprisingly good. There was also Happy Hour where drinks were 2 for 1. ( Just watch your bill at the end - there were many errors)The views from the train were spectacular through the Andean plains. We stopped for a beautiful view of the Andean Mountains and a market where the sellers were quite aggressive. We went through several crowded towns and throughout the trip saw many Peruvians living their daily lives."

It is an interesting experience, but \u2013and especially taking into consideration the price of the ticket- it must be better organized. For some, it is about the details, but it is the details which make you feel satisfied. Firstly, the boarding could be better organized. In Puno, it is somewhat chaotic with no clear explanations given with regards to check-in etc. Not enough space in the waiting room to sit. On board, it takes forever for the train attendant to pay attention to you. And then it takes roughly from 30 min. to 40 min. to bring your order, even if it is only the coca tea. Besides, in our case, they run out of white wine while serving fish as the main plate. \u201cWe don\u2019t have enough for everyone\u201d? With the cost of the ticket close to 200 dollars, you at least expect that they don\u2019t save on wine. By the way, the coffee is the instant coffee. On the positive side, the train attendants helped us with washing fruits and brining extra plates to serve them. One more thing to mention. The tracks are in horrible state. It is like flying in constant turbulence."

It is very comfortable, the food is very good, as is the drink and the service but the scenery through which you travel is by far the highlight of this journey. This starts as soon as you leave Puno and travel along the shores of Lake Titicaca across the Altiplano to Juliaca. As you enter Juliaca make sure that you are at the very rear of the viewing car as you will not have seen anything like the market that you pass through and over just make sure that your camera is secure, and snap away. The demonstration of how to make a Pisco Sour is enjoyable as are the Pisco Sours themselves. The music and dancing interludes certainly break up the journey, but they do go on for a while, so choose a seat towards the back so that you can escape in to the viewing car.The journey through La Raya Pass is truly spectacular as you climb up to 4,313 m (14,150 ft), this is also where you pull in to allow the train from Cuzco to pass and have the opportunity to stretch your legs at the little station at the head of the pass,This is also a very relaxing journey and a good way of recharging your batteries as you travel through Peru. If you do find yourself wanting to travel between Cuzco and Puno this is the only way to do it!"

We enjoyed music from local musicians, a welcome pico sour, fashion show and a lesson on how to make pico sours. Lunch was good with several choices. We were asked what would like to drink with lunch, however it never arrived. Our host was transferred to another section and our preferences were not followed up. We were then asked to pay for the juice and coffee we ordered, but never received. This made the end of the trip very unpleasent.

The train itself was beautiful with a great bar and observation car. Our only complaint however was the seating in the main coach. While the coach was beautiful to look at the seating was extremely uncomfortable. All the seats are upright upholstered chairs in which it was impossible to get comfortable for any length of time. The two of us were at a table for four with four seats and it would have been agony if all four seats were occupied. While we were glad we took the Andean Explorer we wish it had been a bit more comfortable."

First of all I love a good train journey - relaxing and a great way to see the countryside / country.This train trip was high on the list of activities we wanted to do whilst in Peru and our itinerary was worked around taking this train as it doesn't run every day.We were taken to the station by our guide who helped us check our bags in and made sure we had everything we needed for onboard. The train departs at 8am and we were settled into our seats well in advance of departure.It begins at a leisurely pace through Puno and Juliaca (where it stops) before slowly weaving its way through the Juliaca market that is located only inches (and in fact on top of) the railway lines. The whole journey is approximately 10 hours arriving into Cuzco in the early evening.Lunch is included in the price but snacks are available on board to buy throughout the trip. Given the early departure we also chose to wait until we were on the train before having breakfast and the scrambled eggs and fresh breads we had were excellent. Lunch is a three course affair and we had a lovely chicken soup followed by beef and then a chocolate pudding.The train makes a brief stop at the highest station allowing you to get out, walk around and take some photographs. Another benefit of the train is the rear carriage is open at the back allowing you to get fantastic pictures without glass windows in the way.With each carriage on one side there are a series of tables for 2 and on the other side mainly tables for 4 with the odd table for two.It was definitely the most amazing train journey I've had the pleasure of taking and something I would recommend."

The trip takes 10 hours and takes you through part of the Andes, with the highest point reached being 14,172 feet. The first half of the trip takes you through the suburbs of Cusco, along the southern part of the Sacred Valley, and along the Urubamba River. You get into the mountains during the second half of the trip. The cars are luxurious. You sit at four person banquettes, with two arm chairs on each side. The chairs are comfortable but they are placed a little too close and getting out from the window side chair to the aisle requires your seatmate to get out of is/her chair. For sure, order window-side seats on the left hand side (so you can have unobstructed views of the Andes) if you are heading south to Puno. There is some entertainment provided, two musical groups, one playing Cusco music and the other Puno music. They are different. The groups include a dancer demonstrating local dances from Cusco and Puno. The ticket comes with food - a morning muesli, lunch, an afternoon tea, and a free pisco sour. There is a club car for additional beverages which you can purchase and an observation car with an open-air back. The musical groups/dancers play in the club car. In the club car we were treated to a class on making pisco sours and a \"fashion show\" of alpaca sweaters, dresses. Some might be put off by the 10 hours it takes to reach Puno, but the ride is relaxing and the scenery something you will miss by flying. Bring along some reading material and binoculars. The entire check-in, luggage drop-off was quick and hassle-free. If you try to order tickets on line but your dates are unavailable, try contacting Peru Rail directly by email. That happened to us and our email was quickly responded to and the purchase process was again relatively hassle free."

We travelled from Puno to Cusco and being the time of year there was only one carriage which was to our benefit in that we left and arrived on time, meals were served earlier than announced (although the announcement was for the train coming from Cusco to Puno) and the service was timely. The scenery on the second half of the trip was fantastic - partly due to being in the rainy season. So that said why am I only rating this as average. Well, through out the journey there was a sense of the staff aggressively upselling additional services (drinks / food clothes etc) and when turned down the smile became a frown. For the price coffee and tea should be included as should the breakfast. What should be a pleasant laid back trip is ruined by the aggressive upselling. As mentioned in many of the reviews the quality of food was not great and looked as though it had all been pre prepared and just heated up for the trip. The afternoon tea was slow and by now the staff gave the impression they were would be glad to reach the terminal and finish for the day."

Of a 2 weeks tour of Peru, this turned out to be one of our favorite days. The chairs are extremely comfortable, the rustic elegance takes you back to travel in the old days. Everything was clean, and we found the service to be quite good. I agree that the food was only average. I had also read the comments about food delays, we packed snacks and a couple sandwiches, but we did not experience that problem. As we traveled the day before Christmas and the train was only half full, I suspect that we lucked out on the server/traveler ratio. We enjoyed the dancing, music, and pisco happy hour. The tables allowed us to play cards and other games. We spent a lot of time in the viewing wagon, talking to other travelers. Oddly, not many people partook, despite the scenery and beautiful weather.I do agree with other travelers that the doors are a problem. We had originally been booked at tables near the door, and were thankfully able to switch, else wise it would have been miserable. The company should invest in automatic doors or systems to not aggravate the situation. I highly recommend this trip."

The scenery for the fist half was spectacular (similar to the MP train), but the second was the dull drab altiplano."

It was easy to book this train through the Peru Rail website. Any questions I had were answered promptly and accurately. Also be aware that you can check your luggage on this train.The train, itself, is just like in the pictures- comfortable armchairs, tables with tablecloths. The observation car is great giving you the opportunity to stand outside and get a great feel for the route you take. The meals were very good- 3 course lunch, and afternoon tea. Not mentioned in the information is the morning pisco break with entertainment, the pisco making lesson with more entertainment including a band and dancers or the stop at the highest point with the usual possibility of souvenir shopping. The 10 hours passed most pleasantly as we enjoyed the luxury of this 20s inspired train through the Andes."

The scenery was nice, and the train was nicely done up too. The down side is that it is very expensive and when we hopped on they told us that water was free. We asked several times for more water but at the end of the trip they tried to charge us for the bottles of water that they had brought, considering the price that you have to pay and that you are told it is free we thought it was disgraceful. We refused to pay, and they let us go without too much fuss."

We were impressed by the quality of the train and the service provided by the train staff. The seating was comfortable armchairs facing our own table. The carriage was a little cool early in the day so we asked for blankets to cover our legs and these were brought immediately. Whatever we needed was provided. The train was not full, and the ratio of staff to passengers was good. Free pisco sours were served in the observation/bar car twice during the trip, and a champagne cocktail was served just before afternoon tea. Lunch was served on time. My wife's meal of soup and lasagne was very good, my meal of potatoes and trout was not as good, but the chocolate dessert was fine. Afternoon tea was served around 4:30, and was good, especially the dessert chocolates. Although this is a long trip the scenery is spectacular and the armchairs were comfortable enough to snooze in. There was live music in the bar car and a demonstration of some local costumes. The observation/bar car was the centre for socialising throughout the day. Overall this was a memorable trip."

The interior was very well decorated and maintained, and the toilets were comfortable and clean even after a 10 hour ride. The staff were up beat and helpful. They offered a fashion show of lama wool products (serving free pisco sour) as well as a short music show which made time go by pleasantly. On a whole the food was not amazing but they kept coming by with various nibbles. The main negative point was the temperature. The carriage we were in was next to the last open carriage ( really very beautiful and good for taking photos) and the door between the two was rarely closed making our carriage increasingly cold. On a whole it will remain an unforgettable experience."

            "review": "Great journey apart from other travellers. What could have been a sensational trip was marred for us by where we were sitting and the behaviour of fellow passengers.. We booked online with Peru Rail and were allocated seats 31 and 36, a table for two opposite each other in Carriage A which is right in front of the drinks/viewing car. This table is right next to the door on the left as you go into the carriage. This meant that for ten hours (except when people were eating) we were closing the door behind people going to the viewing car. It was like sitting in a throughfare - middle aged fellow travellers who should know better but unable to close the door behind them plus harassed staff with trays of drinks. The same people kept coming through, oblivious when we slammed the door behind them to keep out the noise and the cold. However despite this major irritation the train is gorgeous, well appointed, and reminiscent of a bygone era. Love the little bud vases on the table with red roses, table lamps and cloths. Expect morning tea, lunch and afternoon tea plus pisco sours and entertainment on board. The scenery ever changing - what a vista, going through villages and towns, fields and gorges. It left on time from Puno but was late getting into Cusco but this is about the journey as they say not the destination. There are plenty of photo opportunities and one retail opportunity for handicrafts halfway. But don't expect to see anything you haven't seen before from these sellers. If you are getting picked up by your hotel as we were, there are two pickup spots at Cusco railway station. We thought we had been let down but our taxi was waiting on the street up a walkway from the station. Our advice is to get seats in a carriage at the front of the train and when you do go to the viewing car at the back CLOSE the door behind you."

There were four seats to each table. The food was delicious and the service fantastic. There was live entertainment in a separate car. There was also an open caboose where you could stand and get some fresh air. The best part about the train was the relaxed way in which we were able to take in the country side. We are able to take amazing photos and the children liked that they could stand in the back, walk around, wave at village children, and look at all the animals as we went by. It was quite an experience to ride through Juliaca and observe the poverty. Every foreigner on the train was in awe as we rode through that town. Because the train ride was ten hours, we made friends with almost everyone in our car and that added to the enjoyment of the experience. It was certainly one of the highlights of our trip and I would recommend it to everyone."

I felt the service was patchy mainly because the staff were rushed off their feet so requests for drinks seem to get forgotten. My main issue was the timing of the meal. Our table was set up at 11.30 but we did not actually get lunch until 2.30. After a 6.30am start we very hungry. The scenery was great and ranged from the mountains to passing through busy towns. I would recommend the trip but felt the service could be improved."

The journey, taking a full day from morning to early evening, takes you through a varied Peruvian landscape and towns. The open rear wagon gives passengers an extensive panoramic view as the train slowly makes it way, at one point passing right through the middle of a market, with the vendors clearing items from the track then immediately putting them back again behind the train, in some cases leaving them in place as the train passes harmlessly over them, truly amazing sight. With so much to see and appreciate, enjoying the splendid onboard service was secondary. The carriages are fitted out very elegantly, polished wood and soft furnishings abound, very comfortable armchairs at your own dining table, super service, provided in our case by the ever atttentive Nora. It's all very indulgent.The train was late into Cusco, but that's not the point of it. Travel by road and everything flashes by, not much quicker and far far less civilised and enjoyable. Take the train, it's really very wonderful."

The service on board the train was great - good attetiveness by the staff, fun experiences (from bartending classes on how to make Pisco Sours and more). However, I had a bit of an issue upon arriving in Cuzco wherein another passenger took my suitcase (apparently, they didn't check that it wasn't at all similar except in color!) At any rate, as you can imagine, I panicked! However, the staff at Peru Rail, particularly, the supervisor (Patricia - I may be spelling her name wrong) - were so helpful! They admitted this had never happened before and yet, that didn't deter them from being as creative as possible to figure out how to get my bag back. Finally, we tracked down the gentleman who took my bag, and Patricia came with us to the hotel to ensure that we traded bags properly. Granted - this is something they should have done but it was the professionalism by which this was handled that I was impressed by.Later, we took Peru Rail from Cuzco to Machu Pichu. And, upon arriving in Machu Picchu, we were greeted by a representative from Peru Rail who said that Patricia had sent him with her sincere apologies for what had happened. He then gave us each a \"welcome\" bag of sorts which had a Peru Rail backpack and a Peru Rail water bottle (filled with cold water for our trek up to Machu Picchu!) - how thoughtful. This part was unnecessary in my opinion - it wasnt' there fault that some guy took the wrong bag! All in all, very impressed by the professionalism of the staff at Peru Rail - particularly, Patricia! And highly recommend this as an option if you travel to Peru!"

As a couple of 20-something backpackers splurging on a $200+ luxury train ride, we weren't too suprised to see most occupants were at least 20-30 years our senior.The trip started off well with prompt breakfast service, although you had to PAY for breakfast... even after I've already forked out all that money for the train ride. This was followed by a free pisco sour (at 9am? I like this train..) but then I began to wonder when these 'wonderful' views would turn up.The scenery was nice, but if you've taken the train to Aguas Calientes, visited Macchu Picchu or gone on one of the tours to the Salt Mines or Moray (out of Cusco) then it isn't anything new. The train itself is really nice and well fitted out, but the service really lets it down.Lunch eventually arrived, 2 hours late. When we stopped for photos up by the mountains my girlfriend had fallen very ill (not from the train food, probably from dinner the night before) so I asked if we could access our luggage to get some medicine. Eventually one of the staff told me that the luggage compartment was locked and we couldn't, but he would get us some medicine and bring it to us. We never saw him again. We also asked one of the waitstaff the same question but he never seemed to do anything about it.As expected (from previous reviews) the train was about 1.5-2 hours late, but we figured that would be the case. With no real information over the speakers or from the staff, we eventually all shuffled out onto the station.The train was nice, the scenery was just okay, but there was no way I would contemplate doing the trip again. The train tracks follow the highway for 90% of the journey - you'll get the same views on the bus, get there faster, and spend a lot less money."

We were told lunch served at 1pm. Eventually got the starter at 140pm, the mains was delivered at 210pm. And desert at 235. The outcome was that the stewed beef was cold. I think it had just taken so long to serve the food. We were in carriage A , which was at rear of train. It was a shame since the food itself seemed well prepared. If there is a shortage of staff, then much better to stagger the meal times by carriage. It was clear that the service was being done by carriage, since before our meals arrived , people who had finished their meals were coming through our carriage to the observation car. Seating was comfortable howver when the sun came out, the train got very hot as no air conditioning. Remember to take own water as only free with lunch, The process was similar for the afternoon tea, we were told to take our seats early at 450pm, they served a pre-tea alcoholic drink, but nothing for those not drinking alcohol. The tea didn't arrive until 530pm , again I suggest serving by carriage, if there are not enough waiters. The journey took 11hours, and the guide that met us, informed us that it was common for the train to be more than 12 hours. In hindsight having spoken with those that took the much quicker bus journey, we would have taken the bus. "

On TAE it was first class service all the way from the cheerful and obliging staff whom I thought were efficient and very polite. The train is beautifully decked out and chairs were very comfortable. Passengers were free to move to the observation deck for photos, join in the entertainment provided or enjoy a drink or two at the bar. I learnt to concoct Pisco Sour on TAE! Of course one of the highlights for me was simply to relax and take in the stunning countryside scenery most of the way and what photo opportunities.

This trip whilst in Peru (my route was Puno to Cusco) did not disappoint.This is a very comfortable journey. You have your own table and chair in your dining cart and can leave your belongings at your table, if you wish to go to the bar or observation deck. I was a solo traveller and had my table for one. It was very spacious with plenty of legroom. The lunch included a complimentary drink and you also get a welcome Pisco sour included in the price. The wooden panelling of your dining cart and the toilets gives this a lovely sophisticated feel of a bygone era. The toilets are constantly kept clean.The scenery during this 10 hours and entertainment provided throughout the journey means the 10 hours go by very quickly indeed. Entertainment includes: welcome pisco sour in the bar, live music and dancing, a cocktail making demo and a small fashion show where they showcase some of the items of clothing (made from alpaca of course) that you can purchase on the train.Considering the price, my lunch was of a very high standard. Afternoon tea consisted of a couple of pieces of sandwich, but I was too full up to try it. This trip is excellent value for money and a really nice way to travel between Cusco and Puno.I would highly recommend this to anyone."

When we arrived we were very impressed with the waiting area and live music but couldn't help noticing no one else had luggage except us. Turns out they were all collected but we were made to carry our large backpacks and find somewhere to put them on the train. The service was good, the train was comfortable and the views were amazing. Our lunch was extremely rushed and we wondered why the staff were running up and down the train. Before we'd finished dessert they announced there was a problem on the lines and we had to get off and change onto another train. We had to jump down a 4 foot drop onto unlevel ground, again carrying our bags as a lorry had overturned on the lines. While this wasn't Peru rail's fault at all, the way they dealt with it was what ruined our trip. The engine was connected to the viewing car which filled with black smoke so could no longer be used. The seats were all facing backwards, we were never told how long the delay would be (we were stuck at the scene for less than an hour but arrived in Puno 3.5 hours late). I'm glad I experienced it but if I had the chance I wouldn't do it again."

We arrived to the train station at 7;30 and boarded the train almost immediately. Seating is reserved on the train. I was with a small group and we were all together. The train left on time at 8:00 am on our 10 hour trek to Puno. The cars are in wood paneling and very comfortable seats combined with a table where you are served beverages and meals.The service level was impressive throughout the trip with a 3 course lunch, afternoon tea and a Pisco Sour time. They also have a viewing car with a bar that offers entertainment throughout the trip. The train makes a stop at the highest point where you can get off and stretch your legs. the altitude could be felt at that stop but it was good to stretch our legs.The bathroom was always kept clean and was quite large for a train bathroom. My only negative was not about the train but in going through the towns - the trash. Peru must work to clean up their towns, it was probably the worst I have ever seen in all my years of travel. Such a beautiful country and such bad trash in the towns the train passed through."

The countryside is ever changing so there is no boredom and the Andean folk music and dance were not tacky. The train travels through a market where the stall are less than 20cms away and there is a photo stop at the highest altitude point of 4320metres. Train travel certainly beats the bus and affords great insights into the Peruvian outback. The lunch and afternoon tea were about average for train food. One word of warning you will be offered expressos, hot chocolate and water which are not included in the package and staff do not make you aware of this."

On the contrary, we loved every minute of this long trip. Frankly an the time the travel agent suggested we take this trip I was a bit hesitant , after all, 10 hours. But, these were the shortest 10 hours I remember. The train is in a very good shape, well looked after and one is reminded of Agatha Christie's books. It was long enough trip to make new friends, enjoy the sights from the observation car, the Pisco sour, food and the entertainment. It made me look for other interesting train trips around the world. I do Hope to experience another trip like this. I think it is a great way to climb to the altitude of Puno . But it was a strange experiens to drive through Puno,s market, made us feel like colonialist."

Luckily the train company and railroad workers were able to clean the debris up in time to get the trains running again in time, but it was a little hectic to say the least. We did pay extra for the upgraded package and food service but never received the upgrades due to the chaos, but in all honesty we were just happy to not miss our train and trip to Machu Pichu.The train stewardess Luz was incredibly friendly and knowledgeable on the history of not only Cusco, but the entire country and she stayed with us throughout the majority of the ride and talked with my family and I informing us of a lot of interesting information.

They do not check for luggage and we did not hear of anyone having to pay for their lugagge at all.We took the cheapest service in the train in the Expedition class and franky the seats were great and the views were stunning.

The easiest way is to spend the ride in the lounge car (with the added bonus of an easy access to the viewing platform) because the restaurant cars have no space for wheelchairs, which necessitates transferring to the fixed-position restaurant seating at tables.Beware that the door to the lounge carriage is very narrow. The door to the restaurant carriage is somewhat wider, but the passage between different carriages is narrow again.

It wasn't until after lunch that I discovered the Observation Car. It is a shame because there were so many amazing photo opportunities of the farming communities that I missed on the first half of the ride. I spent much of my time in the observation car leaning out over the back, with the wind in my hair, waving at anyone I could see (especially little kids) and observing the Peruvian countryside. It was a very introspective time, allowing me to really experience the moments. By the time we got into Juliaca, I had heard about the people throwing rocks at the train and the danger of it. A security guard came out to ensure that nothing bad happened and to warn us not to lean out to much. We did get rocks thrown at us and a couple people flipped us off, but I also got some waves and smiles. And honestly, I don't blame the people who have resentment towards us. I can understand seeing a train that represents a small group of very wealthy (especially in global terms) observing the very poor. Even with the minor hostility, I have to say that this part of the trip was one of the most interesting. You are going through this large town and the train tracks seem to serve as a marketplace. There are people everywhere selling food, electronics, auto parts, pretty much everything. It was so overwhelming and there was so much going on, but it was fascinating and made for some fantastic photos. This trip will always have a special place in my heart for how it made me feel and the sadness of the world. There were areas that were poor and polluted. Areas that were vast and empty. Areas that were full of activity and crime. There were people that loved us and people that hated us. Very incredible experience."

I have to start by admitting that my review is probably biased: I live in Switzerland, a.k.a train country, and as many of my fellow country men, I am somewhat of a train buff. Consequently, I knew before boarding the train, that this would be a memorably journey, and it indeed was. The seats are comfortable, the crew very sympathetic and polite, but most important: the landscape is breathtaking and offers many pictures opportunities, either from your seat as you can slightly open the window, or from the observation car at the back. I had a book with me, but didn't open it at all, and spent the entire trip literally devouring the landscape with my eyes. I was quite amused to see other people around me either sleeping or playing with their i-pad, when there was so much going on outside. During our stay in Peru, we also travelled by bus, but the Cusco-Puno train ride was from far the most comfortable transfer, and the one that allowed us to profit a maximum from the landscape, and well worth the cost.Now I have seen that there are some negative comments regarding the slow service. I cannot deny that it is not optimal, but I found that the crew was doing a wonderful job carrying the plates from the kitchen at the front of the train up to the last passenger car. After all, nobody is in a hurry, so who cares if it takes 90 minutes between the start of the lunch and the end. The only complaint I have is that they brought us the desserts, but we then had to wait 20 minutes until they brought the spoons, thus having to look at a very appetizing dessert, without being able to eat it: it is almost a kind of psychological torture!My only recommendation: do it!!!"

Luckily, we opted for the train - it was a fabulous day. The scenery is great; perfect leisurely speed; and a real luxury feel to the carriage - which was not full so we could shift seats. Staff were lovely, and the fashion shows, Andean band, bar demonstrations, etc are all held in the observation car, so you are not disturbed by them unless you want to be. The train and service ran a bit late but if you're a stickler for absolute punctuality, then you're on the wrong train and the wrong continent. Holidays are for relaxing and this was perfection - reading, taking photos, playing cards, staring at mountains, and continuous at-table service. Our travelling companions took the bus. They got to Cusco 30 minutes before us, and missed out on one of the best rail journeys in the world."

We had some apprehension on travelling on a train for 10 hours.Boarding in Cusco we were allocated settee style seating with a table.The chairs are very comfortable and the interior of the train creates a relaxed atmosphere. Our apprehension had soon passed as we took advantage of the observation car to view the stunning scenery. Passing through towns and villages the friendliness of the people waving at the train was great. Service was excellent, the staff although limited, appeared to have a set routine when serving meals which worked well. During the journey we were given a fashion show, dancing, music and shown how to make a Pisco sour. With these activities the time was broken up really well and it proved to be a most memorable journey. Would recommend this trip without any hesitation."

From the minute you step into the train with its Orient Express wood design you know you are in for a wonderful trip. The 10-11 hour trip is expensive compared to other transportation means in Peru, however it is really worth it. You will see nature change between the different micro-climatic zones of Peru with a peak at 4300 meters above sea level! The train is comfortable, however be sure you ask the attendants at the station before embarking if you have a seat that is adjacent to main doors- this brings in cold breeze in winter and is simply annoying! I also recommend bringing some snacks since the first meal served is about six hours after leaving Cusco, depending on where you are seated. I was sitting towards the last wagon and I was served food more than one hour after the advertised time. The other meal is supposed to be tea time however this arrived as we were arriving to Puno. The staff is excellent, but I felt that they were overworked and for the entire duration of the trip they were literally running around the wagons to ensure everyone is being served. Why are there not more people hired, given the steep price of the tickets? Some of the passengers were annoyed by the slow service, but I just admired how much a few attendants could do in one wagon and continue to smile.Some of the highlights of the trip include watching nature from the back wagon's observatory deck- it is a wonderful experience. Another big moment was entering some of the towns just before Puno where you go right through markets.Time passed by very fast and I would highly recommend this voyage. The only improvement required is for the service on board to improve."

The afternoon tea took an hour to arrive from the time the tea cup was placed on our table.The staff walked up and down the Isles but did not seem to notice that things needed clearing. No one bothered to brush down or tables. The train arrived 1 and1/2 hours late-no explanation was offered. I asked to speak to a manager- I was told they did not know where the manager was! ! Appalling! Everyone in my car- the last car (the one next to the bar seemed annoyed- the painfully slow service definitely marred the experience.

A comfortable train ride is the absolute best way to get from point A to point B while having a wonderful view of a foreign landscape. If only the scenery is beautiful we'll feel the trip was worth it, but on the Andean Explorer, the train itself, as well as the services provided, were just as exciting as the views. We took the train from Puno to Cusco. One step into the car and it was like we'd stepped into an Agatha Christi novel: Ivory wallpaper, brass accenting, dark wood, draped tables with real red roses, and wing back chairs greeted us. When the train got underway we explored the back bar car and observation deck, and were further amazed by the almost endless windows, open air observation areas, and wonderful decor. The food was good, and the staff was wonderful. We ordered two mokacchinos early on the in trip, but there was a malfunction with the espresso machine. Our very attentive and polite waiter informed us of this and said it would be ready in about 10 minutes, which we were fine with. Then the waitstaff got swept up in one of the activities on board (live local music and dancing in the bar car) and soon it was over half an hour and we still hadn't received the coffees. We reminded our waiter, who was shocked to hear they had not arrived yet, and he bustled away. He returned shortly after and said \"You know pizza, yes?\" We were confused and said yes, and he continued: \"After thirty minutes it's free? Same here.\" Moments later our two delicious coffees arrived, free of charge. I find that good customer service shows itself the most when something doesn't go smoothly, and this was an excellent example of that. The trip was long, over 10 hours, but so comfortable and engaging that, with the right book and travel partner at your side, you won't even notice. The staff also fills your time with food, drinks, and unique activities. There are parts of the journey where the scenery is sprawling and flat, but mountains soon dot the landscape and there's always interesting people about to watch. If you know you enjoy seeing the world out a train window, you would be amiss to pass this up."

We boarded this beautiful train full of excitement and anticipation, but the poor service almost spoiled what should have been a great experience (especially when you think that a smaller crew can serve twice as many people on a plane). We were told when we boarded that lunch would be served at 1 pm and afternoon tea at 4:30. Now we were on holiday and do not mind waiting, but it would have been helpful to have some information, especially as I am diabetic. As far as lunch is concerned, the starter \u2013 a nice but very tepid soup - finally arrived at 2:30 and we just had to look at our main course (another 30 minutes later) to know it was stone-cold, as the sauce had congealed on the plate by then. We were offered a homeopathic amount of wine in \u201ccompensation\u201d. By the time tea was served, we were supposed to have arrived\u2026 The menu stated \u201cAssorted tea and coffee from the Sacred Valley\u201d, but coffee was not an option. The chaos with the luggage at the end has already been described by others, but at least ours were not damaged. Our guide had been waiting for over 2 hours when we finally reached destination, but was quite philosophical about it as it is apparently always the case \u2013 but he still has to be there when the train is due.It really could and should have been great."

Arriving at the station in good time a porter took our luggage and issued us with a receipt. Nice waiting room with comfortable chairs, the usual Andean panpipes music while we waited to board.Seats are numbered and we were on a table for just the two of us, maybe best as the rest of the carriage appeared to be German speaking. The staff were friendly and polite coming to introduce themselves before the train was on it's way.Seating is comfortable rather like an easy chair, table with white damask cloth, lamp (which we needed later) flowers and a menu.Breakfast is not included in the ticket price but we'd had ours before leaving the hotel although there was a good choice of hot and cold items if anyone required it. We did however order coffee which was served promptly.We were in carriage number one which is adjacent to the bar area open all day for hot and cold drinks and again comfortable informal seating. Beyond the bar is the observation carriage with padded bench style seating and large glass windows plus an open air area right at the back. During the day there were fashion shows and entertainment in these areas.It's very relaxing just to sit back and watch the lovely countryside roll past, the train doesn't speed along and there is one stop along the way for about 15 minutes close to a town where the locals have set up a market.Just before lunch, served an hour later than expected, we were served with complimentary Pisco Sours. The waiter took our order, not much choice but then one would hardly expect so with such limited kitchen space, but all perfectly adequate and acceptable. Wine and soft drinks were complimentary with the meal but coffee afterwards was at an extra cost, unfortunately we had to wait over an hour for the coffee to arrive - such a shame.Afternoon tea followed on a little too quickly, again this was included in the ticket price, sandwiches, fruit, chocolates and cinnamon tea.We arrived on schedule at the station in Puno and were told not to disembark the train until all the luggage had been offloaded. This took around 20 minutes.Our tour guide was waiting to greet us, we collected our luggage on the way through (easy and well organised) and were soon on our way to the hotel,"

Upon arrival in Cusco they are put on the platform (guarded) for fairly easy collection.For not entirely clear reasons our trip took two hours longer than predicted, we waited a bit at one unnamed station somewhere in the Andes for the train driving in the other direction to pass by. This did not pose a problem for us, the driver from our hotel in Cusco was still faithfully there waiting for us.I refer to other reviews for all the good things whichbhappen to you on board. For us the biggest highlights amongst many were the observation wagon (spent hours there taking pictures and developed a sun tan along the way) and the passing through the market at Juliaca. Here the market stalls are about 20 cm or so from the train on both sides and the market closes like a zipper behind the train. Make sure to be on the observation platform in Juliaca!"

I recently returned from a trip to Peru and had a wonderful time visiting Cusco, Ollantayambo and Machu Picchu. Everything from the hotels to the restaurants were great. The sole exception to the enjoyment and my satisfaction was Peru Rail. First Issue: I ordered my train tickets well ahead of time online but still needed to pick the actual boarding passes up at their designated locations in Ollantayambo and Cusco for verification since my credit card wasn't one of their chosen cards. I'm not sure why this inconvenience is necessary since I don't need to provide the same verification for airline tickets (or anything else I ever order online). The whole purpose of ordering tickets online is to save time from having to stand in line at the stations later. Also, the ID numbers of your ticket orders need to be printed at the time you purchase them online. If you don't print them, there is no way of finding the ID later on the Peru Rail web site page later. However, you are able to track your planned train routes. Not sure why the ID numbers of the orders aren't included in the itinerary shown since it's needed later when you pick up the boarding passes. Second issue: The space in the Vistadome train is too cramped. I'm just about 5'10 and slim and had no leg room. A small older lady sitting across from me kept kicking me since there was not a sufficient amount of space for both of us. It 's also a tight squeeze with the person next to you as well.Third issue: From what I read on other reviews, there isn't much of a difference between the Vistadome and Expedition trains so the value is poor as well. I spent $173 round trip. Way to expensive for the service provided and I expect to get more from a \"better\" train.Fourth (and the most annoying issue): I paid for transportation, not marketing theater! Here is what happened. About an hour into the return trip from Machu Picchu to Cusco, the train stops. I'm trying to sleep having been up since 4AM to hike Wayna Picchu and all of sudden, this loud Peruvian salsa techno music starts blaring on the train speakers waking me up. Then, this Peru Rail employee dressed up in a rejected Mardi Gras-like costume comes running down the aisle hooting like a wounded owl. He selects a young female passenger and starts dancing with her while continually making this horrid hooting sound. He temporarily stops and leaves. Meanwhile, the male and female train attendants for the train car begin walking down the aisles modeling alpaca clothing for the passengers to buy (everything from sweaters to scarves). When they go behind the curtains at each end of the aisle to change wardrobes to model, the costume guy returns and performs the same irritating dance, clapping and hooting. This goes on for 15 minutes (but seemed longer). Can't make this stuff up. All I wanted was some peace and quiet, but instead, I get woken up by this nonsense. For damn sakes Peru Rail, your service is to provide safe/comfortable transportation, not to hock your alpaca items onto your passengers for a few extra bucks - let alone disturbing the hell out of them while doing do. There is a time and place for that (like the many markets around Peru aimed at tourists). You'd think for the overpriced tickets being charged, this wouldn't be necessary. Fifth issue: If Peru Rail is going to transfer passengers from their train to a bus for about half distance of the route, they should seriously think of lowering the rates until the track is repaired (or whatever the reason is for the transfer). It's not right to charge customers a full rate for a train when they are only receiving a portion of it.Again, I really enjoyed my stay in Peru and make a point of not being too sensitive/picky on the trips I take when I know effort is being made in the service provided. Peru Rail was disappointing."

While it's a 10 hour trip, the time flies by due to on-train activities and changing landscape. Dances, musical performances, a bartending class, a fashion show (excuse to peddle some alpaca wear) break up the time nicely. Beautiful seats and good food, nice bar car and full glass observation car with an open back. You roll across some beautiful landscapes and villages. Service is very attentive. All in all, the cost wasn't that much more than a flight and we though was very worth it (especially considering the Hiram Bingham is double the price for 1/3 the length and is essentially the same ride). The class/wealth divide between some of the more impoverished villages you ride through is all the more obvious when you're gliding through in a gold-gilted train escorted by white gloved servers, but the locals don't seem to mind and are actually very friendly, waving up at the spectacle of the \"rich\" foreigners traveling through their midst.

We travelled Puno to Cusco by the Andean Explorer, and returned Cusco to Puno on the Inca Express bus, which has 4 site stops on the way. Without doubt, the train was by far the best and most comfortable way to travel. We had a delightful train trip, with magnificent scenery, plenty of opportunity to move around, clean toilets, good food, and other travellers to talk to. And if you're a photographer, the windows open for terrific clear shots, and the opportunities for photos from the viewing car are unlimited! The first 9 hours fly past. It's just the last hour when it gets dark that tiredness sets in. The bus in comparison, whilst cheaper, is cramped and the views and sites from the road are inferior to those from the train, in our opinion. The train route seems to provide much better vistas in many places, or perhaps it's the large windows that make it appear so. For photographers, the bus windows don't open & there's little opportunity to photograph what you see. The lunch included with the bus journey was very ordinary. The 4 stops that the bus makes are interesting, but if you have a choice of either the bus or the train, I would always choose the train, without hesitation. It was a truly memorable trip. The bus was not in that category. If you're doing the return trip, for some reason the Puno-Cusco train trip costs a lot less than the Cusco-Puno leg."

This is an amazing train ride, the scenery dominated by the Andean mountains makes it an unforgettable journey. There is a carriage with a high glass dome roof so the views are incredible. There is always something happening, live music and lovely girls dancing in national costume. The music groups love to entertain. We learnt how to make Pisco Sour cocktails and we were treated to a fashion parade of pure Alpaca scarves and shawls. The food was excellent and the staff were so friendly and only too happy to provide anything we needed.Arriving in Puno was another amazing experience as the train travels through the middle of the markets. The Andean Explorer was a definite highlight of our tour to South America."

While I would say I enjoyed it, I'm not sure I would choose to do it over again after having had the experience. On the bright side:- Friendly, service oriented staff- Lunch was nice - not outstanding, but not bad either- Scenery was spectacular- Observation car and train setup meant you could easily get up and move around the train to stretch your legs- Early in the day it felt like a fun adventureCons:- Train ride is 10+ hours long. Late in the day it just felt like a really long train ride that was never going to end- There was only one touristy stop, for 10 minutes at the highest point in the trip. No information was provided about the areas and places we were travelling through- You are sitting in your great grandmother's wing chair the whole time, at a table. The seats have lots of springs and not much padding. And they don't recline. You might be facing backwards.- The train rocks back and forth relentlessly; this is not a smooth train swaying gently. It feels like a washing machine- If you are uncomfortable with a classic contrast of privilege and poverty, you might be uncomfortable as the train passes through the street market in Juliaca, where the market literally engulfs the train and the security guy in the observation car makes you stand away from the open end of the car so people won't grab your camera- A large rock was thrown at our wagon as the train rolled into Cusco through poor neighborhoods after dark. It could very easily have crashed through a window, bringing our day to a messy endAll in all, it sounds like a better idea than it really is, and it's a lot more expensive than the tourist bus from Puno to Cusco. I would probably try the tour bus if I were to make this trip again - the bus stops more frequently but makes the trip in about the same time from what I've read."

Dessert was good.During the meal services (1 meal + 1 tea time), you could ask for as much nonalcoholic beverages as you would like but in between those two times, you needed to pay. It seems silly that a bottle of water was not included for the 10 hour ride but over all it had great service, lovely views and opportunity to get up and walk as much as you liked. The back was always crowded! Try to get seats at the back of the train so it's not much of a walk to enjoy panoramic views."

The carriage was very comfortable with excellent views and at the rear of the train was a bar and a great viewing area.

Afternoon tea due to served at 4.00pm arrived at 5.45pm but fortunately instead of arriving at Puno at 6.00pm it was almost 7.00pm or else we would have had to take the tea off the train with us! Lunch, whilst well presented, was not hot. The staff seemed more interested in trying to sort out everyones extras bill towards the end of the trip and did not seem to have a system to identify what each table had had. However overall the views across the Andean Plain made up for the disappointment although whether I would pay the extra again is doubtful."

The journey to Cuzco took 9 hours but the scenery was interesting and often extremely beautiful. Initially the train slowly travels through the streets of Puno; then skirts Lake Titicaca before reaching Juliaca. The next phase crosses the Andean Altoplain reaching the high point at La Reya for a short stop and opportunity to stretch your legs before the descent down to Cuzco through more fertile valleys.During the trip we were entertained in the Bar Car by two Andean Folk Groups with dancers; a Fashion Show and a demonstration on how to make a Pisco Sour.

Not only is the train sophisticated with full dining, but the scenery is exquisite every pat of the journey. From rolling mountains, to thundrous rivers, you see it all. What is simply fascinating about this journey is that you really do get additional insight into how real people actually live today, still in their primitive and colourful lifestyles. A humbling experience of the peruvian lifestyle mixed with the class and sophistication of the train. This is a train journey to be remembered. We did it MArch which is autumn and everything is green. I'm sure the landscape would be very different when everything is brown. Either way you are bound to see many glacial peaks amidst the mountains. The three course meal was delicious and the live music on board very festive adding true Andes flavour to the hole experience.

From the moment you enter the station you get a sense of being set apart from the outside world here, which can be rather stark and impoverished.The staff are friendly and seem happy to assist you. There is even a group of musicians playing before you depart.The train looks to be older but in a nice sense, with polished brass and dark woods and leathers used throughout. Seating is mainly first come, though they try to accommodate large parties and situate them together.We were pleasantly greeted and welcomed aboard, found our seats, and quickly moved into slow mode as this trip is several hours long (10hrs). Luckily they have a bar and observation car separate from the dining area. The dining area seats are those you keep for the duration.They offer a show and some entertainment in the bar car, but the best opportunity here are the drinks. The pisco sours (national drink?) mixed here were the best we'd tasted the whole trip long. You have the freedom to move about as you like, and the observation car is wide open, so you have full unobstructed views of the countryside. It is such a lovely and slow paced way to travel. The food is well prepared and tasty. The linens plates and silver are selected to add an upscale feel to the meal.There are good clean restroom facilities provided as well. I think at the end of the journey I counted and there was like 3 staff to each tourist, so you never want for attention and service.The one disappointment came at the very end when you arrive in town and baggage and transportation is confused. The baggage was summarily piled up on the platform and we weren't quite sure what happens next or where to get a taxi, but it wasn't horrid... just awkward. Knowing that, make sure to grab a porter at the finish. If you are on vacation this is a perfect way to slow down and appreciate life and your companion rather than rushing to the next queue like a mad tourist. The luxury, the pace, and the opportunity suited us quite well. We would do this again, maybe on another route."

Entertainment on the train was OK (live music/dance a fashion show)but why do Orient Express insist on playing canned Peruvian music for hours on their trains and coaches to places like Machu Picchu. Poor and reluctant USD exchange rates on board - odd because everyone in Peru takes dollars and this is one trip populated almost exclusively by foreigners. The train has a luggage compartment.

Lots of beautiful scenery, and it was nice to see all the little towns and markets along the way. Our only complaint is a minor one: for the first few hours of the trip, there was local music played over the speakers and it was very loud--was not relaxing at all and did not seem to fit with the \"theme\" of the trip. After over an hour of it, we put our headphones on, but we could hear it over our music.

We travelled on this train in June 2012, and it was one of the highlights of a trip to Peru that was overall full of \"wow\" moments, one of the best holidays we've ever done.Firstly to clarify, given the previous review and a number of others, that the Andean Explorer is the luxury ten-hour train ride running between Cusco and Puno, and NOT the Vistadome or Hiram Bingham train that runs up to Aguas Caliente just by Machu Picchu. On these trains there does indeed seem to be a baggage policy that limits people to taking only small rucksack/overnight bags. There is no such restriction on the Andean Explorer...though big bags are \"checked in\" by efficient and friendly porters and stored in a separate part of the train.We did the journey in the direction Puno to Cusco and it was truly wonderful, certainly our first experience of this kind of Pullman luxury travel. The main carriage, where you have assigned seats and where meals and drinks are served, is very elegant and comfortable, with attentive and friendly service living up to all our expectations.For us the best feature was the panoramic viewing carriage at the back of the train, that included the bar area (where the enjoyable entertainment is laid on), informal seating and the superb open ended viewing area...lovely to stand here, move around and chat with other passengers and take in the specacular scenery, as well as the the vibrant street markets in Puno and Juliaca that you slowly trundle through...colourful fruit, vegetables and goods laid out both alongside and between the rails!!...the market flowing back to life in the wake of the train. The stop at high point of the journey was also great, small tourist market and spectacular views up to glacial peaks. So very very highly recommended and we think, having talked with others who'd done the journey by bus, that they missed out on something special. Finallly, for what its worth, we felt our overall \"circuit\" direction (Lima then Arequipa to Colca Canyon, Puno and Lake Titicaca - including Sillustani and Taquile island visits - then Cusco ending in Machu Picchu) worked well for us with, overall, increasing \"wow factors\" as the trip progressed. But can see there's maybe also a romance of taking the train up from Cusco up to the Lake Titicaca area. Evidently this has to be a personal/logistical choice and think either direction will be very good."

Friendly staff; a hot drink & sugary snack is provided; too little room for luggage makes staying anything more than 1 night at Macchu Picchu (Aguas Caliente) very awkward. The train company ought to review its policy and perhaps run more trains so more luggage can be accommodated. View out of the perspex roof panoramic windows is good - allows you to look up at people walking the Inca Trail!"

The train ride was very beautiful and first class all the way with great service. The price is a little high probably due to the fact that there are no other companies at this time that offer a service like this. The main problem that I have with PeruRail is that they double charged my credit card for the trip. I have sent emails with no reply. Also they have a complaint book link on there website that doesn't seem to work. I would recommend that anybody that wants to use PeruRail to buy their tickets with cash and not to use a credit card as I have read other complaints with people having similar problems seeking reimbursement. Otherwise this would be a 4 to 5 star review."

It seems to be fairly common that when you book your tickets you're not necessarily sitting together but before we even mentioned it the staff moved our seats before we boarded the train. It's a long journey but it is very comfortable on this train, you can also take a bus, it travels mostly the same route for cheaper but what you are paying for is the experience and the comfort. The scenery is fantastic and you can view this from your seat, the bar carriage or the viewing area out the back. The very back is open so you can take great photos from there. One of my favourite parts was going through the streets in Julianca, as you squeeze through the markets you could probably buy some souvenirs. Your lunch and afternoon tea are included and are very good, you can also get breakfast and snacks for an extra charge. There's also entertainment included, not really for me but others seemed to enjoy it. The Pisco Sour cocktail class was good fun. And of course the Pisco Sours were superb. 2 for 1 during happy hour.I would do this journey again."

What was unique was the 3rd world charm of seeing people clear their stuff off the tracks as the train approached and then quickly reassemble their stalls after the train passed by. Not something you would see in Europe. I heard but did not verify that it costs more if you take the Cusco to Puno route than taking the Puno to Cusco route.

The 10 hour trip just whizzed by as we watched the ever changing scenery. This was a great way of seeing more of the countryside and was far better than going by road We started off at Puno and gradually climbed up to La Paya Pass at 4321 metres, where we stopped for a while to take photos and do some shopping for those who needed their shopping fix, before descending.We even passed through a mini blizzard at one point. The viewing carriage at the back of the train allowed us keen photographers to snap away uninterrupted.It was amazing to see how the market stall holders packed up their stalls as the train approached and put everything back over the tracks as the train passed by as if nothing had happened.We had great service and meals provided on the train, all the staff were very helpful, we could not have asked for a more enjoyable way to spend a day getting between these two places.

We opted for the train as a treat to ourselves after 4 days on the Inca trail, little did we know that the food and service from the mobile kitchens on the trail would far outshine the train. To start off all the meals were late by at least 40mins. When they did eventually arrive they were cold! This goes for everything, the soup, the main course and even the tea was cold. How hard is it to keep water warm???? The dissapointment did not end with the food. We had a table for two, nice and romantic. Only down side was that it was next to the cartridge door. Not a problem we thought, perhaps the odd over enthusiastic tourist may forget to close the door when passing through to the observation carriage but not the staff right? Wrong! Despite being ask by my wife on at least 2 occasions one of the train staff repeatedly left the door open, letting cold winds, noise and diesel fumes. On one occasion I watched her stop the door from closing with her trailing hand as she barged through. Overall this was 10 hours of my life I can never get back and I would not expect this type of service from British Rail never mind someone with links/ambitions of Boeing like the Orient Express. This trip should have been a highlight of our honeymoon with the beautiful scenery and a first class experience. Luckily the scenery more than lived up to expectations."

(The journey is actually quicker by road and plane and just as cheap. ) It is however a must for train enthusiasts. The old traditional carriages are clean and comfortable, food and drink are freely available and largely free of charge. We were provided with an excellent breakfast (continental with choice of eggs) and a very pleasant afternoon tea of cakes and sandwiches. The lunch however was disappointing as we found the main course (trout) to be overcooked to the point of being inedible, and cold on its arrival at our table. However the journey reveals the most beautiful and variable scenery and an insight into the rural life of indigenous people that are seen enroute. The high altitude at La Raya (5800metres) visibly affected some people who got off the train to visit the market. Moving at a snails pace through the middle of the bustling market in Juliaca was quite an experience."

We had additional Pisco Sours during the happy hours as well.The best thing about the journey though, are the views. The plains, the mountains, the rivers, the alpaca herds and the terraced fields ... No better way to see them than from the window or observation car of a slowly passing by train. The stopovers to switch tracks with the oncoming train, and at La Raya ( highest point of the route, tourist market and pretty church) are good fun too.Certainly beats flying!!"

Silver service lunch, a bar car, a viewing platform and all under the Peruvian sun. The landscape can only be fully appreciated by this slower pace of travel - from deep valleys, snowy mountains, rivers and plateaus. Could not have been happier to spend the money on this excursion.The lunch was excellent, the afternoon tea less so, but not enough to take the gloss off the journey. Soft drinks should have been included in the price, and that is something I hope PeruRail take on board.Would highly recommend this to anyone who wants to enjoy a bit of the high life on a journey round the country."

Firstly, the seats are literally arm chairs bolted to the floor with no recline (for 10hrs!). The scenery was mediocre at best and most of it was arid farm land. The service is terrible, for example it took over an hour and asking 4 people for a glass of wine, and generally the staff are all moody. The food was cold, the white wine was warm and there's no snacks, only set meals.If you insist on taking this route versus bus or other transport, make sure you ask Perurail to seat you with your partners or friends, they have a habit of placing people randomly."

But to our surprise when we arrived in Cusco and got off the train we found our bags in a pile on the ground outside the train. We noticed that one of our brand new suitcases (was a matching pair we travelled with) was damaged. We picked our luggage up off the floor and went to find someone in charge. We found a staff member who went to find someone in charge, he returned with another employee who we drew attention to our damaged bag. He told us that 'that the bag isn't broken it's just sort of wrecked' ... Now we told him that when we paid top dollar for what is described at a first class service we didn't expect our new bags to be treated the way they obviously had been and to go and get someone who can do something about it. We were then approached by a group of staff and finally the 'manager' Mr Gonzalo Alfaro who looked over the bags and agreed that they had been damaged. He then told us that there was an administrative procedure that had to be followed to determine who was at fault for damaging the bags, whether it was 'the people who loaded them in Puno or Cusco'. We told him that we didn't need an inquiry into who damaged the bags but just wanted a solution. He said they were a British owned company and they had to follow this procedure. He also said that 'it would have to come out of someone's pay'. So unfortunately we had to leave the station with our damaged bag. Before leaving I told him that im not someone who regularly makes complaints (as you can see from my other reviews) and so long as 'there was a solution we were happy'. 5 days later with no contact from Mr Alfaro we contacted him as we were due to leave Cusco. He told us that the issue was still being investigated. Another week passed and we had no contact from Mr Alfaro so contacted him again, we told him that we needed a solution ASAP as we were leaving the country (he was aware of our traveling itinery previously also). He replied to us that the issue has been investigated and they haven't found anything.I wasn't just surprised by the lack of customer service in the first place but this response was just absurd. So if you do travel with Peru Rail be aware they advertise first class, charge top dollar, tell you they are a British owned company (to aleviate our concerns when initially we told him we were worried the issue would be swept under the carpet) but clearly are incompetent when it comes to customer service and dispute resolutions.

The staff were all really nice and helpful.One thing I will say though, there was a fashion parade mid journey where the staff modeled Peru Rail alpaca clothing. The aisle was the catwalk, there was music and some passengers even got in on the act. In the beginning I thought it was obnoxious, but as it unfolded it was actually really good fun. The clothes were surprisingly cool, and everyone in the carriage was clapping etc. A really good vibe.One thing to watch - the train doesn't go into Cuzco.

The observation car offered even more spectacular views, especially when we crossed the Altiplano, and my wife actually spent more of the journey there than sitting at our table (she was very dusty when we arrived in Cusco but said it was worth it!).Passing though Juliaca was an experience! Market stalls were set up beside the track and in some cases over the track. We saw a card table being put back on the track after the train had passed through, with the hands of cards still intact and the men sitting down and resuming their game! The train had to move through very slowly to allow people to get their stalls, and themselves, out of the way. It was chaotic, but fascinating to watch!The food was very good. There is a bar and entertainment in the form of a pan-pipe band. There was a group of about a dozen Spanish students who virtually took over the observation car and created a real party atmosphere. It was great. The scenery was spectacular and it's something that we would highly recommend to everyone travelling between Puno and Cusco, it's the only way to do it really."

The food was excellent, drinks flowing and the views from the open area just fantastic. It didn't feel like a 10 hour train ride, we really enjoyed it. There is a 10 minute stop were you can get off, a small market where you can buy the usual tourist bits and photo opportunities with the locals."

Breathtaking landscapes as the train chugged along the track, alpacas and llamas grazing, panoramic views of snow capped mountains, musicians playing panpipes inside the train, fashion show, making your own pisco sour, etc. made the experience a memorable one. I would highly recommend all tourists intending to travel to Peru to undertake this journey. It is a bit too expensive but nevertheless worth it. Better to have an early breakfast prior to boarding the train (only a three course lunch and afternoon tea is included in the ticket). Do not think twice - just go for the Andean Explorer!"

There was no explanation as to what caused the delays nor was ther any apology. Compensation was a complimentary hot drink.

I thought the scenery was nice - nothing super spectacular - just valleys, rivers, and mountains. There was a stop at a little market in a town, so get ready to be hounded. The ride doesn't include breakfast or drinks, so I suggest taking snacks and water with you. The lunch was good and the high tea was nice. The passenger car doesn't have windows up above, so if you want the upper view you need to be in the viewing car behind the bar. There was a fashion show, two local bands, and a bartending mini-class. The service was nice, but overall Perurail isn't known for fast trains. If you want to get from Cusco to Puno more quickly, the bus or a flight would be much quicker. Be sure to check with your hotel to have them pick you up at the train station when you arrive."

            "review": "Surprisingly, one of our favorite experiences. We decided to take the Andean explorer because we were doing a lot of short flights around Peru and wanted something different. Having spent a total of six hours the day before on the train to and from Machu Picchu, I had mixed feelings about getting back on train for a ten hour haul. It turned out to be one of the best parts of our trip.The train itself is comfortable and inviting. The assigned seats are easy chairs with a dining table, configured for either two or four people. Lunch and tea are included, other drinks and breakfast are available. Bathrooms are way above average for both trains and for Peru.The service is good and the employees are friendly. They take their synchronized lunch service a little too seriously - they stack up like a swat team and rush the tables two at a time, the first time I thought we were being arrested for something. The food is ok. Presentation was good, but we found it all to be pretty bland. I'd say it was roughly equivalent to business-class airline food, albeit better presented. I suppose it's perfectly decent given that it's prepared on a train and served at altitude, but I would have liked a little more flavor. Still, not unpleasant and certainly not a deal breaker.The observation and bar cars are what make the trip. We ended up sitting and watching Peru go by for hours. After having seen all the major sites, it was fascinating to see the non-touristed countryside. This involves seeing quite a bit of poverty (especially in Juliaca), which was effecting at times. But it was educational to see some 'real' Peru.There were only two passenger cars on our train, so there were a very manageable number of people aboard. The bar and observation car were pleasantly busy during the scheduled events (a 'fashion show' and some live music) but were pleasingly low-density at other times.As with literally every organized activity in Peru, there is a handcrafts market. This one is located at the highest point on the journey, which has some nice views. We bought our fair share of generic Alpaca goods here - it was more gratifying to do it in the middle of nowhere and to give money to some people that weren't wholly ingrained in Cusco's hustler culture. If you don't want to participate you can remain on the train.Our only other minor complaint was the perpetual loop of pan-flute theme songs - we heard \"el condor pasa\" and, surprisingly, a song from the Kill Bill soundtrack eight times each. Overall, this was a great experience. The ten hours went by surprisingly quickly, and we saw more authentic Peru from the train than anywhere else on the trip."

I boarded the Andean Explorer from Puno (after Lake Titikaka) towards Cusco ready for a full day of treats \u2013 good meals, good drinks, entertainment even, and that\u2019s on top of the visual treats of the rolling landscapes of Peru. It was an exciting journey. So relaxing just to be able to be comfortable on board the train and wander from carriage to carriage to enjoy its facilities and the view. We were seated at the two seater with dining setting. Once on board, we were given our first serving of complimentary coffee. (After which we had to pay) As the train rolled out of the station, many rushed towards the viewing / observation car to snap photos of the landscapes of Puno that we were leaving behind. It was a slow ride and soon the train rolled in to a little town settlement and we found ourselves rolling along the track really close to housing, and stalls set up just beside the track, rolling over their goods and wares they were peddling and which they set up on the tracks too! However the locals knew that the clearance between the train\u2019s undercarriage and the track would accommodate their goods so they had no qualms leaving it all there as the train rolled over it. The speed of the train was not fast, and it gave us plenty of time to appreciate the colours of the town, the dress of the local people and the hustle and bustle of market commerce. At La Raya which was the highest point of the ride, we were allowed to get off the train to stretch our legs, get some fresh altitude air (I think at that point we were about 4,300m above sea level) and also do some shopping. Vendors set up shop at a platform just next to the La Raya train stop, selling local handicrafts, accessories, plush toys of animals alpaca, vicuna and llhama and also clothings made from alpaca. Back on board the train, we were also treated to entertainment. The musicians that had welcomed us bright and early at 7.30am at Puno station had boarded and was ready to perform their first set of entertainment \u2013 music and dance. My partner was also pulled up for a jiggle, a dance on the train in the altitudes of Peru. There was also a Pisco Sour making demonstration, after which everyone was treated to a glass. (Subsequent orders were on paying basis) Lunch was served in the carriage at the seats and tables we were earlier assigned to and I had the vegetarian lasagne while my partner had meat for mains. In the afternoon and just before afternoon tea (hot beverages and sandwiches), we were treated to yet another round of music and entertainment (seems another group had boarded the train towards Cusco) and so started to entertain us in the bar carriage. Special mention has to be made of the spacious toilets, they were clean and well maintained too! The train was scheduled to pull in to Cusco around 6pm however we were delayed till 8pm. Somehow. All the booked drivers had left the station but some had probably heard that the train had come in so they returned to meet and pick their passengers. We were not so lucky as our driver never came back. However a staff from on board the train saw our predicament and as he was also going in to Cusco, he offered to arrange that his taxi also drop us off at our hotel on the way. For that we were grateful. Overall however, the Andean Explorer would rank as one of my favourite train journeys. And it was definitely a wonderful way to see Peru and all its landscapes she had to offer. Don't miss this amazing journey if you can help it. You won't regret this ride."

On the return it was HOT. My travel companion and i were both sweating and miserable from the heat. It did cool approximately one hour into the return trip. I traveled in June which is their winter but there is no excuse. Its cold at the perurail station and hot in macchu picchu. As another reviewer stated, we are paying tourist prices, we deserve tourist comfort. The seats are comfortable and the scenery is worthy. Our travel agent warned us not to take perurail but we didn't listen. If you are offered a cheaper option, take it. I was very disappointed. After this trip I was ready to return to the states. I had enough. A minimal snack is served. Everything else was for a fee and they were constantly trying to sell you clothing, gifts, souvenirs, drinks, etc. It wasn't a bad experience but I would not do it again."

At around 10am the conductor brings along a Pisco Sour for everyone who is interested.The back of the train is a bar and observation car which is open right at the back. During the day, a couple of different bands play here and there is an exhibtion of Peruvian costumes and some dancing. There is also a demonstation of Pisco Sour making with audience participation.At lunch time the smartly turned out wait staff bring out the various courses in a very efficient and military-like fashion. There are choices for each course and the meal is good, including a glass of vino. At around the halfway point and also the highest point 4000 mtrs the train stops for around 20 minutes. Coincidentally, there is a small market here with the locals selling their handicrafts and there is, once again, a photo opportunity to capture the locals with their baby alpacas and lambs (Fee involved).

As we got nearer to La Roya the valley was wider much like open plains with a backdrop of snow-capped mountain peaks of the Andes. We saw the mountain peaks, lush river valleys, quaint towns and rolling plains glide by. Travelling in Andean Explorer Class (first class), we enjoyed access to the lounge car as well as the open-air observation bar car. The open end at the rear of the train enabled photos unimpeded by windows so was great. We stopped at La Roya for photo opportunity and also a small local market for tourists.After this stop we were then treated to a treat of a delicious three-course lunch. It was served in military precision by PeruRail staff immaculately clad in uniform. It was a great experience with delightful food.La Roya was a watershed in the mountains so we now continued downhill in a much wider valley to Puno some 10 hours after leaving Cusco. A rail journey not to miss!"

I hadn't realised just how long the trip is, but even that would not have been a problem, were it not for the single traditional Peruvian pan pipes CD playing on continual loop. It was interrupted twice on the trip by the performance of live traditional pan pipe music, played enthusiastically but badly, I thought. Coupled with the constant background aroma of diesel fumes billowing from the engine (doesn't help the breathing at 4000m altitude), what should have been a very pleasant (if long) trip was not that great. Fantastic scenery after leaving Cusco, for about the next three hours following the river, very beautiful. Then a bit tedious for about five hours, then the last hour towards Puno looked like it would have been very nice (lots of water on a large open plain), but in our case was replaced by a crashing thunderstorm (also very nice).If the trip had been half as long, with no pan pipe CD (I'll suffer the live traditional music and the diesel fumes) it would have been a five star experience, but as it is I'm pleased we did it, but the Hiram Bingham train gives you pretty much the same upsides, is much shorter, and doesn't have the downsides."

We had heard that this was one of the great railway journeys and so took the plunge on spending the money on the train rather than the bus. The scenery you pass through is amazing and of course being on the train allows you to appreciate this much better than on the bus. The train itself is very nice, with wooden panelling, individual table lighting, a bar carriage and observation carriage open at the back. We had a seat for just the two of us and it was spacious and comfortable. The train makes a leisurely journey out of Cusco, through the countryside and it's great to just relax and watch traditional farming and village life pass by as well as the amazing scenery before finally arriving at Puno on the shores of Lake Titicaca. The staff were very friendly however there were certain elements of the service that I expected better for the price ($220 per person). Firstly, the train leaves early, 8am and you need to be at the station 07:30, however no breakfast is included but continental breakfast is offered as an expensive option. Small elements such as no free bottled water during the journey (stock up with your own before you board the train) and coffee after lunch that has to be purchased rather than included. Including these would have made the difference between feeling pushed to buy extras and being really well looked after.The entertainment included (fashion show, \"traditional\" music, pisco sour making etc) did not really do it for me feeling, as these usually do, less than authentic and staged for foreigners however I did appreciate picking up the recipe for Pisco sours which were of a good standard on the train!Overall really enjoyed the journey however given the cost this is a once off experience."

I hate candyfloss tourism with display of pseudo-culture, and there was some of it indeed on this train (fashion-show, local music performance on the train, pisco making etc.).But it was easy to ignore when it got too much because of the vistadome (last carriage of the train), which was also an open carriage with just a rail as tha barricade between the carriage and the tracks below. Not dangerous in any way since the train moves at a liesurely pace.However, we did spend hours in the vistadome carriage just marvelling at some of the most beautiful scenery we have ever seen in my visit to 24 countries. Although the bus route runs close to the train at several places, it is difficult for me to understand how can you get the view sitting at a bus seat.Although pricey (average ticket price is close to average monthly income for a Peruvian), we thought it was one of the most memorable part of the trip"

Live music, excellent reception hall. It gives you a welcome telling you that you are about to have a beautiful experience. We were lucky and we had two seats, without having a couple opposite to us. All seats have tables in front, with white tablecloth, a table lamp. Windows are huge and give you a panoramic impression. During the whole train trip, which lasts for 10 hours, you are served breakfast, lunch and tea, all included in the price. In addition, you can have other meals or drinks, paid directly from you. The service on board is first class, very polite. There is a show or two on board, the last wagon is also a bar, where you can enjoy a drink or two (beware of what high altitude does to you, better off without alcohol!). and the panoramic windows are excellent. The pace of the train is slow, giving you the opportunity to enjoy a view which is memorable and unique. Some people might be complaining about prices, and that is not comfortable enough. I will say, enjoy. This is a unique experience, and I will do it again, when I am back in Peru. You can do arrangements directly through Internet or through a respectable Peruvian travel agency. The price is almost the same."

The trip was smooth and through spectacular scenery with a stop over at the village of La raya (over 4000m) for shopping of local handicrafts (excellent, nice things, nice people). Excellent 5-star food and table service on board capped with great drinks (table or in the club car) and entertainment (traditional dancing, fashion parades and our great 4-piece Andean band). Great trip for good value. The destination, Puno is another great place to visit on Lake Titicaca - the cultural centre of Peru"

Also a car with a bar where we had a lesson in how to make a Pisco Sour. They also provided us with a live Peruvian band. Yes, it's touristy but what better way to see the countryside than meandering through the Andes on a slow train?We made a couple of stops where we could buy local hand-made sweaters etc. There was a good lunch and then tea.

The guy in the Peru Rail office seemed to understand the sin trigo requirement and sent an email to the Harem Bingham booking email account.

I hadn't heard of it, but we booked through Imagine Latin America - Meike was fantastic and put together a tailored itinerary for us, which included a recommendation for this train which of course nicely links two key attractions we were interested in visiting: Machu Picchu and Lake Titicaca. The idea of a long train journey appealed to us (it takes 10 hours) - we'd previously travelled on the Ghan from Alice Springs to Darwin, and had very much enjoyed it. The Andean Explorer didn't disappoint! From the moment we got on, we enjoyed every minute and the 10 hours flew by. As well as fabulous views of the Andes, the train passes through several bustling towns, and you feel like royalty as the locals stop to wave as you chug by.The carriages are very comfortably furnished, we had a freestanding armchair type chair each and a 'table for two' - the next two passengers faced the other way so we (quite happily - is that bad?!) didn't have to share. Something I just have to comment on - maybe because I'm used to travelling on trains in the UK and their standard of facilities, but the toilets on the Andean Explorer are the most exquisite toilets I have ever seen on a train: well stocked, nicely decorated, and remarkably fresh-smelling. Good news considering we were there for 10 hours!Throughout the day there were a couple of sessions of entertainment in the bar carriage, which is at the back of the train and links to a final 'panoramic' car, with big windows and an open back so you can take in the view. Fashion show, dancing, pan pipes band, cocktail making, we enjoyed it all over a few pisco sours.Before lunch there is a brief 10 minute stop at a 'village', really just a collection of market stalls where you can buy souvenirs. It's a good photo opportunity though - you can cross the train lines and take an unbroken shot of the snow-capped Andes without another person in view. The three course lunch (included as part of your ticket) is served at your seat with a complimentary glass of wine and was nice. The service was great all day, the staff look after you very well, but as other reviewers have said, whilst lunch is included, other food/drinks are not, and it's very easy to just say yes to another coffee or pisco sour when offered without really thinking about the running total. At the end of the journey you are presented with your bill and you have to pay cash (credit cards are not accepted), so make sure you've got enough.Overall this was a great way to travel across Peru - luxurious and stylish. Thanks for the recommendation, Imagine Latin America! I can pass on the recommendation heartily."

We did not get bored for one single second and this train ride was one of the highlight of the holidays. As for the price, it is expensive. But this also has a positive side effect: Not everybody that you meet during the Peru tour is on the train and those that are on it, REALLY want to be on it - the atmosphere is therefore somewhat festive (we found). This trip inspired us to look for other, similar, train rides around the world. Be it in Canada or in South Africa or anywhere else.

It was a memorable experience with really great service and wonderful staff. The food is adequate and tasty and the entertainment included traditional music and dance and a fashion show. There is probably no other train journey which has such warm and friendly staff on board. It is so eay to meet with other tourists especially in the observation car and to share experiences. The train stops at the highest point on the journey for a welcome photo shoot and a visit to the local craft market right next to the train. The views on the complete trip are fascinating overlooking subsistence farms in the Andes.We have travelled on luxury train rides in Alaska and South Africa and the Andean Explorer is up there with the very best."

I am typically a frugal traveler, so I struggled with taking a 6 hour bus from Cusco to Puno ($31 on PeruTour with no sight-seeing stops in between) versus the $220 train on PeruRail (aka Andean Explorer). So, I decided to do both. I did the 4-day Machu Picchu trek and decided take the train as a celebratory treat. I have to say that this is where the journey is more important than the destination. It was very relaxing, clean, and comfortable. The food and drinks were great, as was the service. I enjoyed getting to walk around to stretch my legs and meet other passengers. I took the bus back and the scenery is pretty much the same and it's still quite comfortable. Do the train if you want a little luxury. The bus is totally sufficient if you are tight on time and money."

OK so I knew that it was 10 hours, but didn't realise that you crawled along for 10 hours at about 30kph! - the comfortable arm chairs are no longer comfortable after a couple of hours and are not designed for sleeping with no head rests. Most people dropped off to sleep during the journey at some very strange angles.A 3 course meal is served at lunch time, supposedly soft drinks are free, but we were only offered wine and as we didn't drink were not given any alternative, but the extra menu is brought around many times with exorbitant prices.There is a fashion show and music in the observation car, but a group of tourists decided they were going to occupy it for the whole journey and not give anyone else any room.Look out for the thermal pool at Aguas Calientes before you get to La Raya, here kids are swimming and men washing their clothes! - at La Raya there is a 10 (ish) minute stop, where you are followed by people selling their goods and old ladies asking you to take their photos.Afternoon tea is also served, two tiny little sandwiches and 2 dainty little cakes, plus tea or coffee (no other alternative, not even water).Try to get into the viewing car for the journey through Juliaca, the market lies either side of the train track and you can touch the stalls. There is stall after stall of tiny used car parts, wing mirrors, every piece of rubber needed on a car! - then moves to food, it goes on for a long time - well actually maybe it is just because you are going so slowly that it seems you are going on for such a long time! Through the whole journey the train is sounding it's horn as there are no level crosses and people just cross constantly in front of the train.Before you pull into Puno you are presented with your bill for the journey for the extras you purchase - 17 Soles for a hot chocolate, more than 3x what I paid anywhere else. In hindsight we should have stocked up on supplies first.I guess I would put this down as an experience, but not one that I would want to repeat."

While organizing our trip, we were not sure about booking the Andean Explorer because of its cost. it was much more expensive than the bus, and we were not sure it would be worth it.Well, we did book, and we realized from the moment we checked in that we had made the right decision. The welcome experience was great, the waiting room was comfortable, and the train... Where to start?!?The cabin was extremely comfortable. The decoration has been thought of in details, with a lot of elegance... I almost felt like in an Agatha Christie's novel! The crew was very helpful and very well organized. The bar area was also very comfortable, and the platform was an amazing way to enjoy the fantastic sceneries while travelling. I spent most of my 10 hour trip there, outside, looking at the country side, mountains, rivers, colors, passing by villages, and even talking to people who were always very enthusiastic to see the train coming! I am really glad I didn't have to see all of this from behind a window...The onboard entertainment was fun: fashion show, music, dance, cocktails... We even had a class on how to make the famous Pisco Sour!The lunch was very nice too, and the service irreprochable.My day on the Andean Explorer is definitely a highlight of my Peru trip. It was a beautiful experience, yes, more expensive than anything else we've done on our trip, but definitely worth every penny spent.Thank you Andean Explorer, you gave me one of my best travel memories so far!"

The train is very comfortable and on a par with the first class trains of the United Kingdom, Europe and North America. Lunch is included - and although not a fine dinning restaurant, the food was equally as good as that found on most first class trains in the world. Breakfast is not included, but a good meal of eggs, toast, orange juice and coffee can be had for about $10.The main attraction, however, is the fantastic views along the entire route. You will see rolling hills, mountains, gorges, rivers, and wide grassy plains. You will travel through small villages, farming communities, the main streets of larger towns, and markets. The people along the way were always friendly, waving at passengers in the observation car at the rear of the train. For photographers, it is a delightful day - my son and I are both serious amateur photographers and took nearly 1,500 shots between us. We've taken the best of these and turned them into a book that shows the ever changing scenery throughout the day.Although some people have complained about the price, it is hard to understand what their comparison point is. A 10 hour first class train trip, with lunch, some drinks, entertainment and fantastic views for about $220 per person. This is much cheaper than similar trips in Europe and elsewhere!! Overall, a highly recommended experience. If you don't like trains, don't like relaxing for 10 hours, or don't like amazing landscape and indigenous photographic opportunities, then this trip is not for you. For everyone else, you will find it amazing."

High-end buses cover a similar route, but there's nothing like walking around this beautiful train and chatting it up with other travelers. Seating is incredibly comfortable, and there's lots of space to walk around. There's a bar and observation car at the rear of the train for having a drink or taking in the sights, although bar service is also available at your regular seat. The train also features the nicest bathrooms in all of Peru, which is a big deal on a ten hour journey.Quite a few passengers had issues finding seats with their travelling companions, even though all of us had booked in advance. It seems that the ticketing system isn't very smart about seating people together. Most people were able to change seats with other passengers, but my wife and I were left seated separately, and the train staff wasn't very helpful in resolving this - I'm not sure there was much they could do as the train was full. We borrowed seats from other passengers while they were up and about and spent some time in the lounge, so it wasn't a huge problem. Seating is varied, with singles, two at a table, and four at a table.A wonderful, although not plentiful, lunch is included. They even offer a vegetarian option. A glass of wine and water is included with lunch. Afternoon tea and desert is served late in the day. Breakfast, drinks and snacks are available for purchase. The full bar also makes some wonderful coffee drinks. These additional food and drinks don't come cheap, but that's to be expected on a luxury train. I do suggest bringing plenty of water, because a small bottle is 5 soles on the train.There is one stop just before lunch at the highest point along the route. There's a small artisan market there, but little in the way of food or drink. We were able to buy a large bottle of water there. The views are quite nice, but the stop is only for 10 minutes.Our train arrived in Puno about an hour later than the schedule had indicated. This meant that we saw the sun go down in Juliaca instead of along Lake Titicaca, but it was no major inconvenience."

Below is my review for the Perurail/Andean Explorer:My Mom and I rode the Andean Explorer from Puno to Cusco. It was absolutely one of the highlights of the trip. The views were stunning, and the service was incredible. A true testament to Peru's tourism and hospitality infrastructure.We purchased our rail tickets through their website and printed our boarding passes from the States (they send a PDF, so no worries about losing your boarding pass). As we boarded, we realized our seats were apart from one another. No problem - they IMMEDIATELY and graciously resolved this issue. Our fare included a 3 course lunch, tea time (finger sandwiches included) and non-alcoholic beverages of our choice. Again, I feel compelled to mention the service. They were simply phenomenal. The journey itself takes 10 hours (with a short stop in La Raya) - but like all spectacular rail journeys, those 10 hours just blew by. Our only regret was not taking the Hiram Bingham (another Perurail train) from Cusco to Agua Calientes (we met up with our tour operator in Cusco - a mistake. Peru has amazing transportation and infrastructure, no need to go through a tour operator).Our fare for the entire rail journey (including meals) was $220 per person. Quite nominal when considering the exceptional quality of service and facilities (beautiful, comfortable interiors and the observation car was awesome). We cannot recommend Perurail enough!"

Apparently part of the track has some damage and they had to go very slowly through that section of track. The scenery was not as great as I had hoped for. The 3 course meal was a joke. Probably some of the worst food I have ever tried to eat. The pork chop was so tough and overcooked I actually had to discreetly spit out the one bite I attempted to eat. The vegetable lasagna my family had was equally awful. We were starving by the time we finally got to our hotel, about 9 PM. The bar car and observation car were occasionally fun and the service and staff were very good. If we had to do it over we would fly, hire a driver or skip this area of Peru completely. We thoroughly enjoyed the rest of our trip to Peru, the people and some of the best food we have eaten anywhere. The Andean Exlorer was a very long and disappointing journey, and I enjoyed it the most of anyone in our group."

The target audience seems to be inexperienced travelers and/or elderly people who would enjoy cruises, which makes sense as this is like a cheap cruise: bland, airplane-quality food; silly activities (a ridiculous fashion show with clothing that pales in comparison to what Cuzco's shops offer; a lame 'Come to the bar and learn how to make a pisco sour!' session); waiters bearing trays with cans of Pringles potato chips for sale. The staff rudely dislodged one solo traveler in our car to make room for a couple who complained about loud children in another car. The train was excruciatingly slow--so slow that even those who began the journey enthusiastically were mired in get-me-out-of-here stupors by the time the train finally reached Puno.While the carriages are well-appointed, this is not the sophisticated, refined throwback to grand train travel of the past that Peru Rail would like you to believe. It's a pretty cheesy tourist experience. Yes, the scenery out the windows is gorgeous--but that scenery includes the road where buses made the same trip at significantly lower costs in significantly less time. And their passengers weren't exhorted to \"Come to the bar and learn how to make a pisco sour!\" Next time I'm in Peru, you can bet I'll be on one of those buses."

The small families standing rail side waving from their farms, the family dogs sprinting from the house up to the tracks and alongside the train, the traditionally dressed women tending to their sheep herds... it was a National Geographic moment the entire ride.

It was one of the highlights of our holiday. The train is quite beautiful, the staff attentive and professional, impeccably turned out in livery, and the food was extremely good. However, it is the scenery that this train passes through that makes this journey an unforgettable experience. It is quite breathtaking in places and a dream come true for any amateur (or professional) photographer. The journey may take 9 hours but it passes all too quickly, and anyone who needs a book to pass the time really can't possess a soul!And a special word of praise for the staff. The morning after our journey my husband discovered that he could not find his camcorder (on which he had recorded footage of Lima, Cusco, Machu Picchu, the Sacred Valley) - disaster! We informed our tour guide who arranged for our coach to visit the station later that day en route to the airport at Juliaca. More in hope than expectation my husband went to enquire at the station office as to whether it had been found and handed in. To his immense surprise it was there and was restored to him intact. A wonderful example of customer service and honesty!Incidentally the tour that we took has since dispensed this amazing train journey, and now takes its tourists to Puno by road, which is such a great pity."

We enjoyed first class service from the moment we arrived at the station in Cusco until we arrived in Puno. The ride served as a break from the busy sightseeing schedule. We loved the passing scenery, including very large herds of camelids. The food was fine, but not gourmet."

We knew ahead of time it was slower than the bus or private car but we wanted to relax and be pampered. Drinking starts early with a welcome pisco sour at 10AM and a glass of wine with lunch (both complimentary). The lunch was very good and all 4 of us had the BBQ short rib. The alpaca appetizer was good and the passionfruit mouse was a nice dessert. Wait to buy your afternoon drinks until the 2 for 1 happy hour starts during the fashion show. The bar & observation car are a plus for photographers. Bring some toys, pens & pencils to give the children at the La Raya stop. If you book the train trip through a Peru agency you may save some money (we saved $60)."

The journey started off ok, staff were very friendly, and came around offering drinks. We ordered hot drinks, and then sat back for the long and bumpy ride. Lunch was served- meal was ok. Afternoon tea was not worth eating- stale bread with salad inside. Only choice of drink was tea- when I asked if there was other choice- was told everything else I had to pay for-even water ! (Hot chocolate =17 soles- a 3 course meal is 11 soles in Peru!). At the end of the trip, which arrived 1.5 hours late- we were given a bill for the drinks we had in the morning. We complained and told the manager that were were not told the early drinks were not included (no prices on the menu)- and he apologised and said not to worry. Unfortunalely- one of the waiters did not like this and presented us with another bill! I explained the situation to him- & he then told me I could give him a tip for great service. What a joke!! For $220 US- you would expect some complimentary drinks and snacks onboard the train. My advice is take the bus- much cheaper, quicker and you get a number of stops to look at sights."

The views, including crossing the marketplace (!) of the town of Juliaca are spectacular, food is quite acceptable, and service is perfect. Actually, the whole thing is perhaps TOO perfect, and the fashion shows/andean music perhaps a bit much, even though nobody is pushy. It\u00b4s probably better to go from Titikaka to Cuzco than the other way, and for pure railway exhilaration and atmosphere the occasional Andes train from Lima to Huacayo is in a category of its\u00b4 own, but yes you can\u00b4t travel between Cuzco and Titikaka without taking the Andean Explorer!"

I think there were more staff to take care of us than there were passengers. The train is beautiful, it is what I imagine traveling was like in the glory days of train travel in the U.S. The food was great, the views were great, the service was great. I highly recommend this experience.It is an experience. If you are just getting from point A to point B, by all means, take the bus or fly. The bus would also be a great (and very different) experience, and much cheaper, but this train provides an experience that is hard to find at any price, and I found $220 very cheap for what is provided. I love trains and have looked into luxury short trips in the U.S. For anything like this, for this length of trip and quality of service, it is (not surprisingly) much, much more expensive. I would label this train as a great value.Do note that aside from lunch, afternoon high tea, and an afternoon drink, things do cost extra. Bring a breakfast along if you don't want to pay a few dollars for the very nice items that are available for purchase on board.Also, one important word of caution. If you are planning to get dropped off at the Casa Andina Private Collection, they do have a stop there. BUT YOU MUST ARRANGE THIS WITH PERURAIL MUCH IN ADVANCE. I SUGGEST COMMUNICATING WITH PERURAIL ABOUT THE DESIRE TO BE DROPPED AT CAPC WHEN YOU MAKE YOUR TRAIN RESERVATIONS. We were never told about this by anyone. I blame the hotel for this, but do take note. It is not enough to merely let the onboard staff know about your request. It must be approved by PeruRail headquarters in advance. Once you have done this, then be sure to let the onboard staff know as well, but without prior authorization, they will not make the stop."

You have to know that for a very expensive price ($220 one way), you have NO breakfast (just a lunch), NO explanations/ NO guide at all of all the fantastic various villages and landscapes the train goes through, NO map (unless you pay), not even a mate de coca (unless again you pay); except for the lunch, everything is additional!!... I found it outrageously expensive for what it is. Yes, indeed it is very nice and confortable... but knowing you can get a bus that takes the same road, including a guide and various stops at interesting places on the way, for the same 10h and at only $30, if I had to redo it, my choice would definitely not be the Andean Explorer.By the way, it is worth noting that organised group get a $148 rate!!

The lunch was a bit ordinary but I have never had a meal on a train that wasn't. The trip lasts 10 hours and it is a good way to see the high plains of Peru. The scenery was interesting rather than spectacular, with lots of alpaca herds, flamingos, ibis and heron, the not to be missed filth of Juliaca and the change from green agricultural land to high barren plain with the mountains still towering above it. I know some travellers would move Puno a little closer to Cusco to cut down on the length of the trip and maybe insert a few lakes and more trees to liven up the view but until then just enjoy it for what it is. Its a bit like the Australian Nullabor Plain - you have to do it once. I am certainly glad I made the trip."

It was spectacular all the way -- amazing scenery, great service, entertainment and food. The crew almost worked themselves to death. It is an unequaled way to see a huge slice of Peru from the agricultural areas outside of Cuzco to the awesome plains and peaks as you approach Puno, gateway to Lake Titicaca. Animal lovers will revel in the huge herds of llamas, alpacas, and vicunas. Highly recommended!"

This is a real, old world train experience with top of the line service, a beautifully appointed train and a fantastic observer car (open at one end - no glass so excellent photos) at the back of the train where you can sit and admire the scenery, or do what myself and others were doing - taking hundreds of photographs of the beyond breathtaking scenery the train travels through. Foodwise - over the top for lunch and afternoon tea (yes people, real china, silverware and stemware), served at your own private table. The train is set up so that groups of 1, 2, or 4 all sit together at their own table for meals, playing cards etc, seated in elegant wingback chairs for each passenger. I have never before, and will likely never again experience a train like this - an experience not to be missed."

The station in Cusco has comfortable seats in the waiting room and one can check his luggage in just outside of the waiting room. The train has comfortable seats and an observation car with a bar. The end of the observation car is open so one can stand there and get some good photos during the trip. Lunch is included in the price of $220 per person as well as an afternoon snack. Peru Rail provides entertainment on board as well as music. Travel by plane from Cusco to Puno would be about as much and one would still have to get to Puno from Juliaca as there is no airport in Puno. Taking the train is a much better option. The tourist specialist, .Ms Carolina Saenz, did an excellent job in overseeing things. She is really a nice person and she and her staff did a wonderful job during our trip."

The cons, I agree with other reviewers:1. it is a little more expensive than other travel options2. the journey takes all day.3. Food included as part of the ticket is basic, portions aren't huge.4. Food and drinks are available for purchase, but at \"luxury prices\"With all of the above said, and expected. the journey is pleasant, the staff is professional and the views are great.

Recently, the Andean Explorer was hit by a couple of strikes with one being a general transportation strike which gripped Peru and the second wasa regional strike which caused a blockage of the tracks. Twice I had to change my reservation and finally had to pay extra to fly from Cuzco via Lima to Puno to keep my hotel and travel reservations from Puno. I arrived at the station at 6:30 am was informed about the strike by one of the train stewards who was informing passengers at the door. The next step was to go in, take a number, and wait for a reimbursement. The travel agents were given priority and it was over an hour before the first individual was called. We were told that Peru Rail would not refund to a credit card and would only refund in cash but they didn't yet have dollars on hand to give to the customers and we had to wait for the cash to arrive. They have a bank of computers there for online purchases but would not allow anyone to use the computers to rebook their travel as the computer supervisor had not yet arrived but would be in \"eventually.\" The man in the \"customer service\" office was bored with the whole thing and unwilling to expedite anything for anyone. His ony advice was to sit down and wait my turn. The customer service reps were unhurried and seemingly oblivious that people needed to make other travel plans. I understand that while the strake may have been unavoidable, nevertheless, Peru Rail could have been responsive in helping people receive a reimbursement and making other travel plans. It would not have been a huge stretch to expect some of the managers to help behind the counter and turn on the computers for people to use. No one apologized and no one seemed to care as if this was a buniness-as-usual situation. I was shocked that Peru Rail is owned by Orient Express as the level of client service at the train station is abysmal."

They seem to have mastered running a tourist rail franchise, for better or worse. On the good side- this luxury train offered old-style travel with armchair seats and white tablecloths, decent service, and amazing views of the Andean valley, either out the windows or the caboose (windows all around and a balcony on the back of the train to get 360 degree views). The downside was that it took 10 hours whereas a bus might have been faster (particularly slow going through Juliaca) and a bit touristy (piped in Andean music non-stop, a stop at Abra La Raya that was a total tourist trap, and the ubiquitous fashion shows to sell overpriced alpaca sweaters). Also it's pricey for the luxury of the journey at $140 one way. Still if you want a unique luxury ride on the rails it's definitely a worthwhile experience."

This is a 10 hour trip; I went from Puno to Cusco that takes you back to a more elegant time.Lunch and afternoon tea are provided, that lunch was OK, but the desert was disappointing. The only option on the menu was a poor rice pudding, but they were happy to offer you something else at a cost. The afternoon tea was miniscule which was hardly worth bothering with.The train departed Puno right on time and heads along the side of the lake. It goes past the Grand Old Lady of the Lake, The ship Ollanta. This Ship was built in Britain and assembled in Puno. It used to meet the train from Cusco and operate the night sailing from Puno across the lake to Bolivia and you could then go onward by train to La Paz. Sadly, this stopped some years ago and the ship has been left high and dry since. It was bought by The Orient Express Hotels Group and has been waiting for refurbishment as a luxury cruise ship to sail on the lake. I guess with the way things are now, the likelihood of this happing in the near future is slim. Shame, as I for one would love to do it.About and hour and a quarter after leaving Puno, you arrive at Julicaca where the train stops. On departure from Julicaca, the train then heads down what appears to be the main street and you have market stalls on both sides of the track.The only other scheduled stop is at La Raya, the highest point on the trip there is nothing really here apart from a local souvenir market and the train stops for about 15 minutes.This is a very pleasant trip and was good watching the countryside go by and seeing the Alto Plano change as you then start going down towards Cusco. The train is not the TGV and at one stage a dog was out running us, but then nobody seemed to be in a hurry. The only thing that spoilt it was the loud Australians sitting behind me who seem to think that they were the only ones there and seemed to take great delight at being as loud and annoying as possible.Well done Perurail, but please do something about that rice pudding"
