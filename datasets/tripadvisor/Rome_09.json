From the massive 5-level bell tower to the impressive Mosaic facade to the 150 column quadriportico courtyard with the statue of St. Paul - it is humbling and impressive. The interior art and architecture are magnificent. And, while there were tour groups going through, it was not crowded. Waiting a while, between groups, we were able to view the tomb area basically by ourselves. One of the best churches in Rome."

(aside from the odd clown who doesn't seem to get that he is not in a bar.) it is the perfect escape from the tourist centre of rome. Take the time for the monastery, sit in the garden, walk the cloister. Very unusual marble columns. Great vibe."

Next to St. Peter's this is the most impressive and feeling inducing basilica I've ever been to. It is massive yet calming. The paintings, statues, the courtyard and St. Paul's tomb are all inspiring. I recommend this for anyone visiting Rome. Absolutely worth visiting. Dress conservatively and act appropriately."

If I want some peace and quiet in a place steeped in the Christian tradition then St Paul's withoiut the Walls, especially on a sunny day when the afternoon and evening sun shines on its gleaning facade, is the place to go. A short bus ride on the 23 or on the metro from Termini, you can spend an hour or so here in tranquillity compared with the hustle and bustle of St. Peter's. Don't miss the cloisters and the excavations. Or the excellent cafe and bookshop. The tomb of St. Paul is a special place in a very special building."

Pilgrims and visitors alike could see the burial site of St. Paul the apostle under the main altar of the basilica.During summertime, it's ideal to go here during the late morning and early afternoons, especially if one doesn't want to collapse under the scorching heat of the sun."

Off the beaten path from most tourist sites, but well worth the trip, especially if you're also visiting St. John Lateran which is a short walk away. There is no charge to enter the church itself, but there is a fee to enter the underground historical sites that include the first century home and the churches that were built in later centuries on the same site. This is a particularly interesting site if you've studied early Roman history or early church history. If you pay to enter the historical sites, you will receive a brochure of the site but it would be best to hire a guide or study about the church and its history a little before you arrive, especially the cult of Mithras. For anyone interested in early Roman history or church history, this is a site that shouldn't be missed."

It is incredible that the Roman Church has managed to retain this artefact and display it in such an attractive setting. The high ceilings, the artwork, the chapels all make for a lovely and thought inspiring afternoon. Allow some time for some contemplation. The basilica will not be very interesting for young children or people who don't have an interest in religion or St. Paul, everyone else will be highly touched by the sarcophagus, the artwork and the various chapels."

Unique to St. Paul's are the small round paintings of every pope from St. Peter up to Pope Francis. This is a cool visual reminder of both apostolic succession (the reality that every bishop in the Catholic Church can trace his position back to one of the apostles) and of the ancient lineage of the Church.

The mosaic is divided into three bands. In the lower part, on a gold background, are the four prophets of the Old Testament: Isaiah, Daniel, Jeremiah and Ezekiel. Above them, the 'Agnus Dei' on the mountain of paradise from which flow the four rivers symbolizing the Gospels, which are drinking twelve lambs, symbolizing the apostles.

The vast cavernous nave feels like a forest with marble tree-trunks looming out of the penumbra. Space, quiet, art - they combine to allow awe and contemplation to take hold. This church was rebuilt after a devastating fire - they did such a good job. Beautiful. Maybe then travel to EUR to find the hard-to-find church where St Paul was supposedly beheaded!"

There is no shortage of churches in Rome - it is worth the effort to see some of them, while others fall into another category where you may lump them all together.The major, or papal, basilicas (basilici?) fall into another level altogether. Partially because they are important to the religion, but also because you can get there a bit more easily via transit, or even on a tour.San Paolo outside the walls is an excellent place to visit simply because it's not in the middle of things - as such as it's a sort of oasis that can provide a break from everything else, except that it can be a little challenge to get to. While you are there enjoy your time, since it's all too brief."

Unfortunately, you'll have to walk all the way around the metro station to get through security, so in the end you'll walk a good half kilometer. It's a lovely basilica, a bit low key, possibly a bit overhyped or insufficiently explicated, which leaves one with the sense that it ultimately lacks the staggering amount of art one associates with other Roman churches. It is far less visited than other basilicas in the city, but it's an architectural landmark. Recommended, but not necessarily on your first trip to Rome, unless you want to see all the major basilicas or you have a special devotion to St. Paul. Pro tip: the Benedictine monks of the abbey next door make candies and chocolates, which you can buy in the store."

How happy we are that we followed the advice of previous reviewers and visited this amazing basilica. The queue was only about five minutes long (and that was probably only because we happened to arrive at the time that an event was on). It isn\u2019t hard to get there, and taking a trip on the metro allows you to experience another part of Rome that many tourists don\u2019t experience. The ticket machines have a Union Jack on them to indicate English, so it is all pretty easy. It is only 6 stops (I think) from Termini and from the metro station it is less than a five minute walk. You can see the basilica from the station so you\u2019ll know where to walk.The basilica is staggeringly beautiful. Of course all the churches in Rome are beautiful but this one is in another league. I have to admit I haven\u2019t been to St Peter\u2019s or the Vatican City so I cant compare it, however it is just awesome (in the full sense of the word) all the same. We were very fortunate to visit at a time when something was going on \u2013 hundreds of people with black capes and someone who we think was a cardinal was there. There was also Gregorian chanting/singing which was, with the excellent acoustics, even for a non-believer \u2013 a moving experience. Obviously this wouldn\u2019t always be happening, we just got lucky.It was my highlight of our trip to Rome. "

Paolo metro station (Line B) and 7km from downtown.The fa\u00e7ade has an impressive Neo-Classical portico that was built between1890-1928 with 150 columns, multi-color marble sides and a massive statue of St Paul in the center. The graceful cloister of the old monastery on the side was built between 1220-41 and survived the fire.The spacious interior has one nave with 40 columns of Baveno granite with white Carrara marble, four aisles and a gold coffered ceiling with the Papal coat of arms. The 5th C. mosaics of the triumphal arch and the baldacchino from 1285 are all that remain from the fire and particularly interesting to view. The striking apse mosaic from 1220 depicts Christ flanked by the Apostles Peter, Paul, Andrew and Luke. The windows seem to be stained glass but are actually translucent alabaster.

We had a guided tour of a lot of churches in Rome and Vatican, but the one that I found the most impressive was this one - the Basilica di San Paolo fuori le Mura. The atrium is a wonderful introduction to the church, and what's so fascinating about it on the inside is the simplicity of the columns and walls, and the richness (or gaudiness if you will) of the ceilings. It's also interesting to see the pictures of all the popes lined up around the interior, right below the ceiling. And there's a bonus to this place - the best gift shop in the city with great things we couldn't find anywhere else in Rome or Vatican."

The building is fascinating for several reasons.The tomb of St. Paul is here, for one.The top of the walls also have images of each and every Pope. Legend has it (total rubbish, but interesting) that the world will come to an end when the walls at St. Paul's run out of space to put new Popes!Also fascinating is the artwork over the main alter depicting Christ with Saints Peter and Paul. Usually, Peter is on Christ's right hand side (the more important side!) but since this is Paul's basilica, they are reversed. Highly unusual in Christian art."

Despite being out of the centre of Rome, the Basilica of St Paul Outside the Walls is definitely worth the small effort it takes to jump on the Metro B line...the station is even named after the church.It had a beautiful entryway with symmetrical gardens and a massive statue of St Paul holding a sword. The doors are relatively new, being commissioned in 2008 for the 2000th anniversary of Paul's birth, and contain scenes from four major scenes in his life. The interior is immense. We felt like we had the place to ourselves. It seemed very uncluttered after being in many cathedrals in the UK & France. The fittings were still ornate but weren't distracting from the worshipful atmosphere. There were a variety of small chapels leading off from the main body of the basilica including one to St Stephen, a reminder of Paul's violent opposition to Christianity before his conversion on the road to Damascus.The gift shop isn't overly tacky and we had a very pleasant lunch at their cafe. A real highlight of our visit to Rome."

Though still similar to other designs in Roman basilicas and churches, St. Paul's is spacious--in fact humongous--inside with many side altars and vignettes. Near the entrance to the church on the right as you enter, there is an encased scale model of the basilica worth studying to show the enormity of the building. The statue of St. Paul in the courtyard is pretty fantastic. The Benedictine sisters maintain the church so there is some dedication to St. Scholastica and to St. Benedict. Portraits of all the pontiffs line one of the rows near the ceiling with only six portrait spots left after Francis. The sunken crypt shows a corner of the tomb of St. Paul where visitors and pilgrims can pray and pay respects. Think this is where St. Paul was martyred (beheaded actually) for the faith. The paintings on the walls are wonderful scenes of the faith, easy to understand and not too overwhelming. The ceiling throughout is breathtaking. Good gift shop and cafeteria, too. Dress code enforced. The church can be seen in an hour or less, but the trip to and from adds to the length of time. The ambitious and fit pilgrims will have no problem walking there and back, but plan accordingly if you opt for this."

Very beautiful and nowhere near as busy as St Peters; meaning you can wander at leisure without the crowds. The ceilings are absolutely beautiful and the decor is meticulous and opulent. Services do operate daily so you can participate or just quietly take in the splendour. There are also some great restaurant,s within walking distance, offering great food at a third of the price in central Roma. Not to be missed."

It is an easy subway ride, even though it's on the outskirt of Rome. It starts with an impressive courtyard and then you will enter a magnificent Basilica! At the top of the walls are the portraits of the various Popes from the very first one to the current one. They only few more spaces left for future Popes... It is also the burial place of St Paul. The cloister, is the last survivor of the great fire of 1823. It is worth seeing for a small fee. Do not miss this Basilica and you will be pleased with a more peaceful and tranquil church with much smaller crowds!"

The building exploded due to an intense fire in the 19th century and has been rebuilt receiving donations from all over the world. The apse behind the altar is the only original vestige of the old church. It was redone in the 11th century and the golden frescoes are mesmerizing. Please go and see this church.

When we entered the impressive St Paul's, I (a Catholic) was astounded that there was no charge as we Catholics \"always charge\".It is a huge place that seems to go for miles. There are separate little chapels - some closed to the public - but so much to see. Make sure you look up and see the portraits of all of the Popes - so many throughout the ages. It is a beautiful, spiritual church. One where you can feel serenity and peace (as I did in Fatima) that was somehow lacking in the hustle and bustle of the Vatican. Just in the last few years, next to the huge St Paul's, they've discovered the remains of a monastery built around 600 and they are starting to excavate..........even more wonderful things. There is a good gift shop on the way out.Tip: Don't decide to go to McDonald's for free wifi before heading home. We did this but a very kind employee told me (in Italian that I did not understand, so a Manager came over to reiterate in English) that it was not safe to use my iPhone in the store as gypsies frequented the place and stole mobile phones and tables.

From its massive columns to its papal paintings, St. Peter's is massive, but St. Paul's has a more somber and quietly powerful atmosphere to it. It's a very fitting resting place for a man who was probably the first and most influential Christian intellectual."

The Church is about three blocks away. Saint Peter and Saint Paul were originally buried together in in the San Sebastian Catacombs. Early Christians would go to their tombs and have meals. The Church got concerned about the sanctity of their tombs and moved Saint Peter to Saint Peter's Cathedral and moved Saint Paul to the church that was named after him. It is a very impressive church. It is massive and has a lot to see in it. Pilgrams used to come to the church and drop their crosses in a little hole over his tomb. You must see the mosaics, Saint Paul's tomb and the early relics are fantastic.It also has a fantastic gift shop. Afterwards take a cab to the San Sebastian Catacombs and see where they were both originally buried. Then walk down the street and lunch at the utterly fabulous L'Archeologica Restaurant which is beyond fabulous.DougtheLebaneseguy"

It is only a 1/4 mile of so from the metro station. The neighborhood is a little tough so go during daytime. The Bascilla is amazing! The detail, the garden area, the frescos, the size of the structure were all incredible! The crowds were very light because it is off the main tourist sights. Most of ALL, as a Christian, visiting the tomb of Paul is an incredible spiritual opportunity. Just GO! You will not regret it!

But i was not impressed: the dimensions inside are breathtaking but for the rest there is nothing special to this church compared to the older one nearer to the center of Rome. If you do not have a week in Rome to spend, i would skip this one."

We had already visited most of the key churches in the city, but still we were not prepared for this one, as it has a very specific feel. We entered through the mosaic-decorated courtyard, then moved to the nave to admire the mosaics of the popes. In all, this church is more about the architectural awe and the symbolism of the mosaics and less about individual artworks as many other churches of Rome. It is well worth the visit. Unfortunately we didn't have time to visit the archaelogical section."

I wanted to see what this church had over St. Peter\u2019s. It is huge with a lovely parterred courtyard and columns surrounding it and a huge statue of St. Paul in the center. The inside while beautiful was not in my opinion as magnificent as St. Peter\u2019s. I would definitely not give it a number one rating. There were some very beautiful paintings here. We especially liked the frescoed portraits of all the popes located high on the surrounding walls. The one of Pope Francis had a light shining on it. The church was built by Constantine on the site of St. Paul\u2019s burial and has undergone several reconstructions. It was a little bit out of the way and took about 40 minutes to get there from the city center. It was very interesting, but if time is limited, I would go to St. Peter's instead."

This is solely my fault and to \"do\" Rome again I would be far more discriminating in my choice of venues. It is perhaps wrong of me to vent this on this particular church, which is wonderfully illustrative of its genre and it would be too easy to say if you've seen one Baroque example, you've .... but I guess this is what one comes to expect in Rome or Venice or Florence.

St Paul's outside the Walls is a relatively beautiful church and certainly extremely huge, but I found it rather sterile when compared to other churches in Rome. Most of what you see comes from the 1800s from reconstruction after a fire. It is, in my opinion, just too large for what you find inside. In any other city I would have rated much this higher but in Rome there are just so many other fabulous churches to see. I do not see how anyone can rate this higher than St Peters.The cloister are worth a visit and are very unique. They did not get destroyed in the fire and date from the 1200s.There is a small fee to see the cloisters.If you have a week then it is worth visiting. Otherwise unless you are a Catholic and are on a Pilgrimage of Churches and sacred places then give this one a miss.I visited first thing in the morning before continuing on to Ostia Antica.

Only a few people were visiting this large Basilica, giving you lots of space and time to observe.Paintings of all popes are available close to the ceiling. The most impressive are the ceiling of the nave, the mosaics of the triumphal arch and the large apse mosaic (Christ flanked by the Apostles Peter, Paul, Andrew and Luke). There are a souvenir shop and cafetaria just outside the Basilica.It`s located a bit outside the historical centre.

Even when we exited the metro on the wrong side of the street and spent time going the wrong way before realizing our mistake we never felt unsafe.

            "review": "Papal History and Art without the crowds. When researching from my third visit to Rome I noted to my suprise that St Paul Outside the Walls was the number one attraction on tripadvisor. I had actually not heard of it so thought it might be worth a look because of these recommendations. I would not put it number one on my list for things to do in Rome but I am certainly glad that it was recommended so highly on tripadvisor. The Basilica is replete with papal history and is well worth visiting.The Basilica is a little way from central Rome but still easily accessible by Metro. We took Metro Line B from Cavour (1.50 Euro ticket each) getting off at the Basilica San Paolo station. I recall the way to the basilica was not immediately obvious from the station and that the area looked a little grotty with graffiti and tatty looking market stalls. But one exits the Metro on the viale Ferdinando Baldelli near the intersection with via Ostiense. Turn right onto via Ostiense and one will see the sign pointing to the basilica. The church looks a little plain and uninspiring from this side until the main facade at the Piazzale San Paolo is reached.St Paul's is one of the four ancient papal basilicas, being an important church since at least the time of Constantine. The basilica was destroyed in the fire of 1823 and rebuilt, but much of the historic pieces still remain. Central to the basilica is the tomb of St Paul dating from circa 67AD, and here one can view the large sarcophagus and marble tombstone (I believe these date from the 4th century). On display are also chains said to be those used during St Paul's imprisonment in Rome. This is an interesting site for the religious and history buffs alike.Above the tomb is the magnificent baldachino dating from 1285 completed by Arnolfo di Cambio (c1240-1310) who also completed the bronze statue of St Peter in San Pietro, one foot of which has been rubbed to a sharp, shiny point by pilgrims over the years. di Cambio's work can be seen in all the papal basilicas of Rome and many other churches in the city. Also impressive here is the the enormous candelabrum for the Paschal candle decorated with scenes of the Passion and Resurrection in marble by Pietro Vassalletto in the 12th century. The important remains of the medieval basilica which survived the fire of 1823 is the the triumphal arch with the apse mosiacs by Venetian artists dating from 1220. The transept and nave were destroyed in 1823 but have been beautifully restored. The 19th century ceilings are glorious and the mosaic medallion portraits of every pope is an interesting adornment , a feature arranged by Leo the Great in the fifth century and added to up to the present, Benedict XVI's being the most recently added.At the end of the nave can be seen three monumental doors. The central door of green bronze, inlaid with a silver cross, depicts scenes from the lives of St Peter and St Paul and dates from 1931. The shiny gold bronze door on the right (as one looks from the outside) is the Holy Door which dates from the Jubilee Year of 2000. On the inside of the basilica the counter facade to the Holy Door is the original main door dating from 1070 which was commissioned in Constantinople and contains 54 panels in damascene silver with scenes of the life of Christ.One of the most impressive features of the Basilca is outside, namely the front facade. There is a delightful quadriportico with 150 columns surrounding a pretty and restful garden dominated by a large 19th century statue of St Paul. The facade's mosiacs completed in 1874 are bright and photogenic depicting the prophets Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel and Daniel, then above a central section representing the Lamb of God and the 12 Apostles, finally Christ surrounded by Peter and Paul are at the apex.Entrance to the basilica is free and there is a gift shop where one can experience the usual Italian reluctance to provide change (we bought two small souvenirs for 6 Euros and the shopkeep was pained to have to give change for a 10 Euro note ! Why don't Italians want to give change!? They want exact fare, but then everything is usually 6,7, 9, 12 or 14 Euros, so change is required if one is to pay exact fare. The Catch 22 is that no one is prepared to give you said change anywhere so that you can pay the exact amount! One has to horde 1 and 2 Euro coins like a miser when in Rome to pay for anything. Surely a papal basilica, an outlet of the wealthy Vatican, can afford to get change for their cash registers. I found this all over Rome - the Vatican Museum, busy attractions, small and large shops). The only downside of the basilica was the surprisingly run down, ragged and rubbish strewn Parco Ildefonso Schuster at the front of the property. I wonder if this is separate from the church's authority and is maintained by the city council instead.The Basilica was a wonderful main point of interest during a morning of sight seeing in a less visited part of town. One could, as we did, get back on the Metro two stops back to Piramide station to then see the Pyramid of Caius Cestius, the beautiful non-Catholic cemetery and the Porta San Paolo."

            "review": "One of our favorites!. Basilica St Paul outside the Walls is so worthwhile- might be among the best kept secrets of Rome! The church was built in 1823 after the prior one suffered fire damage. However, it was rebuilt in complete Byzantine style with all the features of all churches in Rome- side chapels, exquisite ceiling, beautiful paintings, lots of statues of Popes, and most of all, exquisite mosaics one could gaze at for hours. Best of all, no crowds at all!! There were perhaps 50 people when we got there, then a guided group of about 30 came through. Other than that, totally peaceful. Because the present structure is a mere 190 yrs young, it's not dripping with the history of a St Peters or St Mary Maggiore, Westminster Abbey, St Marks etc. In fact, some of the walls are pretty bare waiting for a shrine, memorial or someone important to be buried there. Of course, Paul's crypt is there also. And don't miss the mosaic of Pope Francis. . . In day 9 of our trip, it seems we were all reaching our limit on \"beautiful church appreciation\". But seeing this one definitely refreshed us! Yes, it is out of the way of most of the Roman must-see/do places. But very easy to get to on the Metro. Highly recommend."

            "review": "Worth going outside the walls. Rome has a plethora of churches so it takes a rather special basilica to lure the average Joe \"outside the walls\" of the ancient city. St Paul's or Basilica Papale di San Paolo fuori le Mura is just such a church. It's a vast building but the lack of chairs makes it seem even larger. The exterior has a distinctly tropical feel with palm trees, delicately maintained gardens and peach and yellow colored frescoes. The inside uses the same color scheme but the walls are adorned with portraits of Popes up to and including Benedict XVI. The church wasn't around during the reign of St Peter or the next dozen or so Bishops of Rome. In fact construction didn't begin on the site until the 4th century when a structure was built over the tomb of St Paul. Since then it has gone through several overhauls to repair damage caused by menaces ranging from earthquakes to Saracen invaders. Consequently, it oozes history whilst looking a tad newer and fancier than some of the other basilicas such as St John Lateran. The church has a very relaxed ambiance that is in stark contrast to the hustle and bustle of St Peter's and frankly most of the other sites in Rome. You don't have to be profoundly religious to enjoy the basilica but if you are of the religious persuasion you might be interested to get a glimpse of St Paul's tomb which is visible below the altar. Despite being outside the ancient walls, St Paul's is very easy to get to on the underground metro. Even if you don't speak Italian, it doesn't take a linguistic genius to figure out that you need to get off at the stop called Sao Paolo. There aren't a lot of bars or restaurants in the vicinity but there is a McDonalds that has a rooftop terrace from where you plot your next excursion. Despite the intense competition, the basilica is my favorite church in all of Rome."

This was my 2nd trip to Rome and this time on business so we were making quick visits to places around the city. Since this was the #1 rated attraction on Trip Advisor, we decided to make the trip out. You can easily take the Metro (underground) for 1.50 Euros each way and get off of the Blue Line at the San Paulo stop which is 4 stops further outside the city past the Coloseo stop at the Coliseum. It is a short walk from the metro station (go to the left as you exit and then a right at the intersection and you will see it diagonally across that intersection) and there is a McDonald's on the way if you need a quick bite. This is in a very rural area and a 'real' non-touristy part of Rome. You actually enter from the back of the church (make sure to go out the other side and don't miss the front/courtyard view of the outside!) The church was rebuilt in the early 1800's after a fire but much was restored and much was added. The burial ground of St. Paul is in the center and a small portion is unearthed for viewing. There was a small mass occurring during our visit so the chanting was lovely. You can light a candle for a loved one as well as leave a donation near St. Paul to have a mass dedicated to a prayer of your choice. There are instructions near St. Paul. Or you can spend nothing as the entrance is FREE! There are portraits of every Pope up until today along the eaves of the church. Make sure to go to the gift shop early in your visit as the church remains open until 18:30 but when we tried the shop at 18:25 it had just closed. :( It is a very beautiful, moving place to visit and due to the 10 minute ride past the Coliseum it is not as well visited. Good luck for all of us!!! :) It is AMAZING!!! A must see."

It was a quick walk right out of the subway stop, just like the Colosseum subway stop. So convenient. Also a McDonald's right there for a rest area stop before and after going to church as well as a quick lunch. We got tired of eating pasta and pizza every day.We were delighted that this church was relatively massive tourist/throngs free! So nice to walk around in peace without the chatter and distraction of the masses like at St. Peter's Basilica or the pushing and shoving at the Vatican Museum! We spent 2.5 to 3 hours here! I wish we had just paid the 4 euro per head to go into the cloister, a separate part of the church.Lovely church with portraits of every Pope lining the ceilings as well as a peek of St. Paul's sarcophagus beneath the altar. Also lovely grounds surrounding the church as well as the garden in the front of the church. Would be blessed and happy to return to this church."

As many other reviewers have said, this church is off the beaten path of tourist attractions, and for anyone going to spend more than a day in Rome is what you want. In fact, we took the subway down to the closest stop and walked the block or two to the church. Once inside, it is nothing short of breathtaking. The church itself is probably the size of a football field, and the beauty inside speaks for itself. The main attraction is of course, Paul's tomb which is located towards the front of the church. Once at the tomb, you can see where his tomb was cut out of the marble and set behind a grated fence. Just to have the ability to stand and view the tomb of one of the Bible's greatest preachers was breathtaking! What many people do not know is the fact Rome was/is split between those who followed St. Paul and those who followed St. Peter. Sadly enough, both men served and gave their life for Jesus Christ and the ministry of God's word.In closing, if you're a Christian who knows or have read Paul's writings (13 books in the New Testament) in the Bible, and don't stop at this church, you have missed out on a once in a lifetime chance in history. I would also suggest visiting the \"Tre Fontane Abbey\" which is the location of where St. Paul was beheaded. I could not see one without the other!God Bless!"

He brought us to this beautiful basilica that was built over the burial site of St. Paul. I am so glad that he did. Here is where you can see the tomb of St. Paul under the altar, as well as the links of chain that are believed to be his prison chains. It's a beautiful sight from the moment you enter the courtyard. As you're in the courtyard, you will see the statue of St. Paul and the colorful gold mosaic of Christ with the two apostles by his side. Then there's the large central door of the basilica which tells some biblical stories. It has panels with various scenes of St. Peter and St. Paul. To the right of the central door is one of four Holy Doors. It's a door that is only opened during Jubilees. The interior of the church is even more ornate than the exterior. The gold coffered ceilings, the papal portraits, and the colorful mosaics are all very impressive. The border of papal portraits is truly unique to this basilica. Every pope has a picture. The current pope's picture is always illuminated. Pope Benedict's portrait was lit up at the time of our visit. Do take the time to visit the Basilica of St Paul Outside the Walls. It actually turned it out to be a very memorable visit. One that I will never forget."

The train is the Laurentino Line B, just four stops to San Paulo Basilca stop. It was an easy transition.The church is huge and relatively unadorned but very elegant. The original church built during the time of Constantine was destroyed by fire in the 1800s so this one is quite recent in comparison to many others. There are many wonderful statues and likenesses of St Paul everywhere. The huge bronze door depicting many scenes from Scripture is one of the treasures of Rome and was made in the 11th century in Istanbul.The supposed tomb of St Paul is much venerated. There is a case containing a chain which illustrates Paul's imprisonment in Rome. Below that is the sarcophagus where Paul is reputed to have been laid after death. It was a great place to visit with very few tourists."

Paolo stop which is on the Blue Line in the direction of EUR from Termini. On walking there I approached the building from the side; not recognising it at first until I spotted the familiar facade (see the photos attached). I was in Rome in the off season period which; in my mind is the best time as opportunities for photography are increased due to the fact that the crowds are not there. What I wish to advise people on is how you should approach photography in sacred places. Although I do take a lot of pictures; I am always very aware of remembering and respecting these sites. Once inside; if photography is permitted; I NEVER use the flash to maintain respect for the site regardless of the lighting. I find that the natural lighting in any case gives a nicer picture in most circumstances and in places that are dark; I accept the fact that the pictures will be dark. Not using the flash I feel is the most important way of respecting these places. Also; you should never take photos when Mass in process. I have been to Mass and have seen tourists snapping away with no regard to what is going on. I hope you find this tip helpful; and please enjoy my photos."

When you visit, definitely pay the extra price to go into the Cloister. It was the best part. Also, I recommend renting the translation devices for a guided tour. Even not understanding Catholicism, seeing this Basilica gave me a deep appreciation of the faith. This Basilica holds what appear to be the remains of the Apostle Paul, which was humbling.

From the moment we entered there was someone playing the organ. Soft, sweet, melodious strains of music wafted around you as you walked through the church taking in the beauty. We ended up being here still at 5pm as mass began which was absolutely gorgeous.This church was built over the place where early Christians believed the Apostle Paul to be buried. When archaeologists dug underneath the church they found this sarcophagus which had the remains of a man who would have died around the same time as Paul and inscriptions on the outside saying \u201cThis is Paul\u201d meaning that there is a chance this really was the burial place of the Apostle Paul.

Without question, you will be drawn in by the chains which held St. Paul before his death. Imagine him being dragged to this spot outside the walls of the city, bound in those chains, to his beheading.Don't Miss: The bronze Holy Door, which, like the one at St. Peter's Basilica, is only opened during Jubilee years.

There were not a lot of tourists visiting, which was a nice change from most of the other major sites in Rome. We chose to take the bus from our accom in Campo de Fiori. Unless you are sure of the bus route I would not chose this option. On the website for the church is said to catch bus 23, which we did. What we didn't know was that we caught the bus going the wrong way, so we had to go to the end of the line and then change buses. We got there eventually but it took a long time!

I actually appreciated this basilica better than the crowded St. Peter's basilica which may be unbelievable to some but bear with me, there were several reasons I liked this church. It's outside the center of rome and you can take the Metro B line. We bought the 3 day tourist pass for the Rome public transportation which cost us about 16 euros each for adults, children are free yeah! but it was worth it. We just basically hopped on bus, the metro and planning where to go was easy. The Metro system was easy to understand. We went on a weekday around 1pm and it was so quiet, serene and solemn. Which how it should be coz I think people tend to forget that this is a church and a place of worship. There were probably less than 20 people inside this huge basilica and they allow you to take pictures even with flash, the one thing they were strict about was the attire. Knees and shoulders should be covered, but wearing a scarf around the waist and over the shoulders is acceptable.I was blown away by the art, the ceiling, my mouth dropped open when I walked in and it took a while for it to close. Thankfully there was no flies around. After walking around a bit, if you are catholic you can go down this set of stairs in the middle where the crypt of St. Paul is said to be in...but you cannot see the crypt, just a metal grate and say a little prayer too. There is also a small table by the stairs where one can write down prayer requests for mass with donation. We did not go to the archeological site because you have to pay 5euros so went to the gift shop instead. It's a big shop, airconditioned and has a lot of variety for souvenirs and gifts."

Yes, that means at BEST it was number 4 of 4. Plus, it is a ways from downtown, as we walked to it and back from city centro (for the exercise too). The art is okay, the half dome main chapel was 'okay' even with the commissioning pope some how included to the left (facing it) of Jesus' feet, but it just felt completely different than the other three. I do admire the opportunity to actually go into each chapel, and everywhere else but the altar, but it let me down. IMHO this is not a must see, but if you want to fill out the major basilicas during your visit to Rome, please don't say you were not warned this one is not on the same level."

The place is very solemn and a sense of reverence will pervade your whole visit. Second, it is very easy to get to. A quick cab ride or a ride on Metro line B to the St. Paul exit. a five minute walk will put you at one of the entrances. Finally, after our visit we explored the area around the St. Paul stop and found great local places to eat and various shops where we found clothes, purses, jewelry, etc., at way better prices than in the more popular tourist stops.The garden inside the walls (see picture) is beautiful and they also have a cafe and, of course, a souvenir shop.

For some reason, it doesn't draw big crowds, so you almost feel as if you have the place to yourself. It's dim and reverential, and just feels real. The sarcophagus containing the body of St. Paul was recently rediscovered, not surprisingliy, exactly where it was traditionally believed to be under the main altar, undisturbed since interrment in the 4th century (when Constantine built the original basilica). Before then, from St. Paul's martyrdom in the 1st century, his body was kept in the catacombs on the Appian Way."

However, if you venture away from the center you will discover a magnificent huge church called St Paul Outside the Walls. It is an amazing structure, with wonderful gardens. The collection of art and the ceiling is unbelievable. I spent over three hours in the church. Everywhere you looked there were new and exciting things to see and absorb. It was like information overload, but in a very positive sense. It is well worth the cab ride to visit one of the four major churches in Rome. It is a must when visiting Rome."

The basilica of St Paul is far away from most other sites in Rome, however it's only a short walk from the metro station so quite easy to get too.On the walk up to the entrance, you pass either a hospital and stalls selling goods, or open park land that had a fun fair and would be hosting a concert later. If this felt a touch tacky, then as soon as you approach the church all thoughts are focused on the exterior - it is truly amazing.The most striking feature for me was the huge golden wall that was unlike anything I've seen in Rome. When the sun is shining on the wall, it looks dazzling. The entrance garden is very well tended and has a large statue in the centre as you approach the entrance doors.Be aware that as this is a holy place, then you will need to cover up bare skin.Upon going through the main entrance doors, you are in a grand hall that is huge - it reminded me bizarrely of the school hall in Harry Potter. Very grand, very quiet and very impressive.The main altar was very grand, and the tomb of St Paul was also visible, but the most impressive thing was several small chapels off the main hall - private, discreet and personal spaces in which to pray.One of the most impressive churches in Rome and a very peaceful place. Very much a sense of history and culture here.Although free to enter, there were a couple of paid for areas such as the excavations - I didn't try these though so cannot comment. A small store is also on the way outside along with some facilities.Recommend for any visitor to Rome."

Any of them could leave you speechless. That said, I would hate for anyone to miss the Papal Basilica of St. Paul Outside the Walls. With its huge colonnaded courtyard and palm trees, it's unlike any other church in Rome. It is peaceful and elegant both inside and out. The translucent alabaster windows are sublime. The Emperor Constantine built the original church on St. Paul\u2019s tomb in the 4th century. The tombstone and one side of the sarcophagus can be viewed near the altar. Standing before it is a profound experience. There was no cost to enter the church and there were only a few people there when we visited. It\u2019s a very special place and comes highly recommended."

We loved our visit to St. Paul's for several reasons...first, it is incredibly beautiful (both inside and out). it also has a very open feel inside, relative to many of the other, monumental churches.second, it was very moving to see the tomb of St. Paul and a small section of the chains that he wore.third, we found it to be much less crowded -- which made it a much more enjoyable experience. We went during the afternoon and it was almost empty, relative to a number of other churches we visited (especially vs. the incredible crowds and waiting lines at St. Peter's, it was a welcome change of pace).fourth, it is located next to a large, attractive park. So a good place to take a walk, or have a break, before or after your visit. It would, for instance, be a good place for a picnic before or after.A couple of notes...first, remember that when visiting Italian churches, you need to be wearing either pants or capri pants (below the knee) -- no shorts -- and have your shoulders covered. They were selling (for 1 or 2 Euro's), some simple smocks for the ladies who arrived inappropriately attired.second, although the church is away from some of the centrally located sites, it is close to one of the metro line stops. You can't see the church from the metro exit, however. So we asked a vendor at a newspaper stand and he pointed us in the right direction."

There is also a replica to show what the original church looked like. It must have been wonderful to see.Our sixteen year old grandson said it was his favorite church of all that we saw on our trip through beautiful Italy.

The mosaic apse can be illuminated by the coinbox at front right of the apse. Stunning ceilings and a beautiful baldicchino. Particularly favorite was a holy water font on the far right, depicting a cherub dipping his fingers in the holy water while a fallen angel cringes nearby.Odd place to find a cafeteria, but food was good and affordable. Had lasagna and Coke Light for \u20ac12.This site is an easy stop on the regional train line; if you buy a trans pass (1-, 3- or 7-day), take Metro B to Piramide and transfer to Regional train at the Ostiense station next door.

Next to St. Peter's Basilica I believe it's the largest church in/near Rome. You will need to arrange transportation to see it as it is south of Rome about 15 miles. We took a taxi, then for return transportation had to walk a few blocks to find a taxi stand (about 8-10 minutes away). There is also a Metro (subway) stop just as close as the taxi stand which is less costly. While in the area, walk (or find a taxi) to take you to the San Sebastion and San Callisto Catacombs which are within a couple miles distance of St. Paul's.

We've been to St. Peter's (which you have to go to) but you can't take the time to enjoy it when everyone is elbowing you trying to take pictures. This was fairly empty when we were there and we were able to just look and enjoy. It's very large and it's older than St. Peter's. It is a very short walk from the metro and worth the trip. We were able to go see this and make it back to the Pantheon in less than an hour."

It is beautiful and it also contains the tomb of St. Paul. Because it is less visited, it is much more conducive to prayer. The mosaics are beautiful and not to be missed! There is also a nice little bookstore and cafe. It isn't within walking distance, but as one previous reviewer said, it can be easily reached by either the 23 bus or the Metro. It is more than worth the trip! I make a point to visit every time I go to Rome! It should also be noted that this Basilica is under the care of Benedictine monks. Each time I have visited, there have been Benedictine priests available for the sacrament of confession. The Basilica is open all day. It is a good place to visit when many of the other Roman churches are closed in the afternoon."

Not as opulent as St. Peter's (nothing in the world is), but grand in its own right. It quite possibly has the widest main sanctuary anywhere, its like a football stadium. It is so big inside that you never feel crowded, its also fairly quiet inside, much more serene than most of the other lively sites of Roma. Giant pillars, gold ornate flat ceiling, giant cherry wood carved doors and many murals depicting the life of Jesus and Paul's missions. This church definitely has more of a Bible vibe than its pope heavy counterpart in the Vatican. The enormous statue of Paul in font is much larger in person than in pictures. I recommend starting any visit to Roma by hitting up San Paolo first thing in the morning."

Of the 4 major Basilicas in Rome (Mary Major, St. Peter's and St. John Lateran), St. Paul easily has the most beautiful grounds/compound. It is well-manicured and clean. The outside courtyard is inspiring and beautiful. Inside the Basilica itself, the Church is ornate, but not gaudy. Filled with statuary, paintings and a tasteful Alter, the Church/Basilica is truly inspirational and thought-provoking. On the grounds, there are also clean facilities and a good-sized gift shop with nice souvenirs and Holy gifts. I would recommend taking in all 4 Basilicas, if you get the chance. Don't miss St. Paul Outside the Walls...it is a beautiful and reflective Holy space."

I bought a metro day pass...highly recommended...and set out to St. Paul's as it is furthest off the beaten path. Incredible! It was easy to get to...minutes from Termini station...and I think there were eight people in the entire place! This is the site in 1958 Pope John announced the Second Vatican Council to an expecting group of cardinals. It contains the remains of St. Paul...including the chains that supposedly bound him while in captivity. It is the second largest church in Rome and the gardens and courtyards are a beautiful as the church itself! While an old site, historically where St. Paul was buried after execution (hence outside the ancient walls), the ancient church burned down in the 1800's, the reconstruction was beautifully done. I can only speak for early December but while all the rest of the basilicas were packed, St. Paul's was an oasis of calm and peacefulness. I highly recommend it!!"

Not only were we able to get our bearings but we stopped at a few places our guide, Claudio, thought we might not include in our three days in Rome. St. Paul Outside the Walls was the first stop. It is a large basilica just outside the Roman wall. At that time burials inside the Roman walls were prohibited and St. Paul's grave is at the altar of this church. The grave and the chains Paul was bound in are certainly sights to see but be sure to look up. On the ceiling are portraits of the 260+ Roman Catholic popes. Gazing at the portraits, I was struck by the scope of the Church's history. The grave itself is crowded but the basilica and the grounds around it are beautiful and large. It's easy to find a quiet place to reflect and enjoy your surroundings."

One of the four papal basilicas in Rome, St. Paul's has a rich history and is one of the more simple looking (yet beautiful) churches in Rome. Because it lies off the beaten path the church is never \"crowded\" and maintains a serene feeling. The courtyard in front of the church is gorgeous and peaceful. Be sure to view the stone remnants from of the old church that was destroyed by fire."

This site is dedicated to the Apostle Paul. The inside of this Basilica is magnificent. Inside are chains used to bound paul. His burial place is beneath the altar. Outside is a large mable statue of Paul. When you couple this site with Mamertime Prison - where Paul was held, The Abbey of Three Fountains - where Paul was chained to a column and then beheaded, the Bascilica of San Sebastian - where Paul's remains were temporarily housed, and St. Paul Outside the Walls - where Paul is buried, you get a tremendous view of part of Paul's life and persecution in Rome. Please don't miss this site. Also inside I wad pleased to find a very nice statue of Stephen the first Christian martyr. There is a beautiful Apse inside above the altar and the columns are gorgeous. There is also a great statue of an Easter candle inside depicting various Christian scenes. The base of the statue depicts ancient Babylon. There is also a segment showing Pilate washing his hands in regards to Jesus's crucifixation. Please go and enjoy. Thanks."

From the grounds outside, to the beauty inside, one would be loathe to miss the experience. An added bonus, aside from all the beauty that surrounds you while there, for making the longer trek out to the church is the fact that there is a portrait of every single pope since Peter around the interior of the church - WOW seems so inadequate."

If you love history and believes in God then this is definitely one of the best experiences you will get. You will need to cover you shoulders as a respect when you get there as with most Basilicas in Rome. But that doesn't draw away the amazing panoramic view of the amazing hall when you enter the building. All with great paintings and amazing architecture! And as you walk to the end of the church in the middle is the tomb of Paul the Apostle!! Such a awesome experience. A great tip is to visit the basilica's at around 4pm where most of the tourists are left and you get the stragglers behind. I had a great change to pray in front of Paul's tomb because no one was there. Its just phenomenal."

This was our first stop when we arrived in Rome - one of Rome's four ancient major basilicas; an amazing church which is gorgeous and just humbling to be in. This was supposedly the burial place of Paul the Apostle, where it was said that a memorial was erected after his execution. It is so grand and so beautiful that when you stood within the church you will truly feel small and insigficant, overwhelmed by the tall columns and the intricacy of the interiors. It is another one of those must-sees when you visit Rome, along with the Vatican, St Peter's Basilica and the Arcibasilica Papale di San Giovanni in Laterano."

I saw it as a favour to my husband, as part of a full day Vatican tour that included four basilicas. And while I never need to see another basilica again, this is the only one I am actually happy I saw. It was originally built by the Emperor Constantine in the 4th Century, right after he legalized Christianity for his mother, Helen. It's allegedly built on the site of the beheading and burial ground of Saul/St Paul, who was a Roman citizen and could elect the way in which he would be killed. (It's relic is the chains St Paul supposedly was wearing at the time of his death) Because it was outside the walls of Rome it was subject to repeated sackings and was finally consumed by fire in 1823. The wooden ceiling (likely lit by a careless workman's cigarette) imploded into the center of the building rather than falling away, which heated the marble structure to the point that most of the columns exploded leaving only one side aisle standing. This led to a reconstruction that has a lovely unity. It also means that the basilica was gifted with some interesting materials including alabaster columns from Egypt and an impressive malachite side alter from Russia. The windows too are highly original as they are all thin slices of rich yellow, brown and cream marble. The golden mosaic apse (which may predate the fire?) is also very beautiful. While this basilica is now quite accessible by public transport, it doesn't seem to attract the hordes and so has a quiet, serene quality that enhances the pleasure of touring it. Of course it's huge size also dilutes any impact that puny human beings would have on the experience. To satisfy the savage beast, however, St Paul's Outside the Walls has the most generous washroom facilities I saw in Italy as well as a moderately air conditioned cafeteria style snack bar that serves hot foods as well as gelato, ice cream based treats and lots of liquid refreshments."

We were able to wander around at our leisure without the mobs that are at St. Peter. The cloister have a modest admission charge but worth a visit. There is a pleasant restaurant and gift shop on the grounds. The original church was destroyed by fire in the early 1800's, the rebuilt church mirrors the original. Be sure to see the Tomb of St. Paul and his chains on display."

It is magnificent in it's proportions, silent and reverent, and always prayerful. The crucifix that St. Bridget of Sweden would converse with is here as well as the tombs of Sts. Paul and Timothy. The mosaics of the Popes is also a study in history and I love seeing the current one highlighted each time I go. It gives such a rich link to Peter, the first Pope and is a good visual for a church timeline. The cloisters are well worth the few euro to enter and the relic museum and history given is beautiful. I am impressed with the new set up outside the cloister for the gift shop and historical facts. Very sleek and lends a greater sense of the sacred to the church itself to have these removed slightly. Be sure to view the church at the front entrance from outside as the golden mosaics in the sun are too beautiful to be believed."

There is a ton of graffiti everywhere in the area, so it's a little daunting, but you can see the church from the intersection at the top of the little hill. Go right and it is an easy walk. We were struck by the beauty of this, and all of the churches in Rome. The ceiling is incredible- even more so when you pay and light it up. You can go down and see part of the crypt of Saint Paul. The pictures of the Popes line the walls. It was impressive to see the succession through the building. The little chapels were all worth looking into, also.Outside, near the gift shop, there are restrooms where you can leave a small tip. The shop itself has everything from religious items, to candy, to liquor made by the monks.When we left the gift shop, we came up on the garden area, and the view of the painted mural or mosaic top of the church. It was beautiful. There is also a Jubilee Year door dedicated by JP II off the courtyard.This was a little off the beaten path, but worth the metro ticket to come and see.

I made a point of visiting as this is one of the 4 \"major\" pilgrimage basilicas and I was a pilgrim.Unless you have a great devotion to S. Paul, don't waste your time. The original basilica burnt down in the 1800's and was reconstructed. It's an empty shell for the most part and has little inside to see or experience. You can see a sliver of the apostles tomb below the altar though. In addition, it's a good way outside Rome proper so be sure the Metro isn't on strike or you'll be paying rather expensive cab fares (as I did). There isn't a good bus link and there's no taxi stand anywhere near. If the metro is running, there is a stop about 1/2mi. from the exit.The reason this church gets two stars is the lovely gardens out front and the very nice gift shop selling abbey made products (vs the same tourist postcards at other churches). My major rub with this Basilica is that it felt actively unfriendly to the pilgrim or visitor. It's a cold space to start with, and the people staffing it were just plain mean. One verger gave me directions to a taxi stand...except in the exact opposite direction (even pointed it out on my map!) Another, when asked where the Metro stop was replied \"outside the church\". Really? Because I was looking for the turnstiles next to the altar....thank goodness you were here to tell me otherwise. I hate to sound petty where a church is concerned but let's face it, WWJD? He wouldn't be jerky to people visiting His house, that's for sure."

Gardens outside are lovely, and the Basilica is beautiful. Explore all the smaller chapels at the back. Paul's sarcophagus is visible behind glass as well as a section of chain, supposedly from his imprisonment. Can be reached by taxi or by bus."

It is in continual use and as a spectacle it is wonderfully impressive. It can be refreshingly cool on a very hot day. The art work in the ceiling is impressive and the connection with the Apostle Paul, to one who has been helped and inspired by his writings for some decades can be a moving experience. The sarcophagus of the Apostle is currently being examined by the R.C. church and they are possibly trying to tantalise us with their findings but to stand by the tomb and think that the Apostle Paul's remains are contained in the stone box beneath the alter is quite a thought."

This church is located just outside of central Rome but it's only a couple of metro stops past the Colosseum stop on the Red Line metro and totally worth the trip. It's about a 5 minute walk from the metro stop and it is a truly amazing and beautiful church. To start off, it's massive. Every square foot of it has such intricate detail and history. There isn't much else at that metro stop so you could see the church, spend about an hour or so exploring the inside, and then hop back on the metro and head back into town.One tip: the pizza place next to the McDonald's (across the street from San Paolo) is very good and reasonably priced."

The fact that you are standing in front of the tomb of St. paul is awe inpsiring. I am Catholic, but any Christian who has read the New Testament, this is a pilgrimage to see the tomb of the apostle to the Gentiles. Here is what to do. We got on the Metro at the Piazza Republicca, there are ticket machines there. There are two lines, orange and blue. St. Paolo blue is the stop. You get your tickets, use a credit card it has all languages, then choose the all day pass, it was like 4 euros. At the Republicca, it is the orange line, don't be scared. Get on orange to termini and then you will have to switch to blue. Get on blue Laurentina is the final stop. It is like four stops and you can't miss the stop because that is the name. When you get off the train, head to the left and keep going, this station stinks to high heaven and it was gross, but keep your eyes on the prize. They have signs in the station with arrows pointing toward the basilica. You come up out of the Metro, and then turn right. You can almost see it as you emerge. Follow down about two blocks, and then you enter the church on the side door. Be sure you are dressed with covered shoulders, they will deny you access. St. Paul's tomb is smack dab in the center. There is a map as you enter. Be sure to go out the big doors at the far end, that is where the courtyard is with the statue they show on the websites. The side entrance is kind of....scruffy, but the front is spectacular. They also have super clean restrooms on the opposite side of where you will come in. Just so you know. Really, don't be scared of the metro. It is surreal and you will thank yourself for a lifetime for going. THEN, when you go home, read the book of Romans, it has a whole new perspective. God bless and safe journeys!"

Basilica di San Paolo is located just a few metro stations away from downtown, but for some reason a lot of tourists ignore that. The site of the basilica is absolutely amazing, it's quiet, well taken care of and possesses some really great sculptures. It's just as majestic, perhaps not as huge as Basilica di San Pietri, but it's worth visiting nonetheless. The entrance is free and you can take some really nice pictures. Again, it's very under-rated, because people usually don't visit it, so no matter what time of the day you get there, you'll find it almost empty, which, in my opinion is even better than being a part of a large crowd like in Saint-Peter's basilica."

In my opinion this Basilica is definitely one of the top sights in Rome.Although the outside is somehow unsightly and common, the inside is spectacular. I was delighted with beautiful large mosaic, vast spaces and portraits of all popes since St. Peter. It is placed a little bit out of common tourist routes but there is a metro station nearby. There is no entrance fee and surrounding area is nice and quiet without too many people which I found very relaxing.We visited it at Wednesday afternoon around 17h and there was a Holy Mass in progress. Probably the place is more crowded in the morning and during weekends.I highly recommend it to everybody, especially those who do not like crowded sights with rivers of tourists swarming around."

A beautiful church, a great story and a great name \"Saint Paul's Outside the Wall's\" (in italian \"San Paolo fuori le Mura\") was interesting and challenging. We had difficulty getting there - it's not really within the city - though we decided it was just off of the common tourist map and worth the hassle. After delaying several days we finally went to the Metro early in the morning with the aim that we would take the train to San Paolo and walk back to the city makings stops at Piramide and other locations along Via Ostiense.Arriving at the Termini station to take the B line 2. We went around is circles for a while figuring out where to buy tickets and finally picked up two tickets for 2 Euros at a tobacco shop (called Tabacchi in Italy, they sell bus and train tickets among other things). If we had waited we could have bought tickets at large ATM-like machines just prior to entering the turnstiles to the trains. Live and learn.Passing through the turnstiles we made our way to the platform. The platform was quite full and quickly got more and more full. We ride the T here in Boston from time to time and this was as busy as rush hour or say, after a Red Sox game. Romans are in our experience friendly, nice and quite helpful, so we were a little surprised by the pushing when we got on the second passing train. When we later discovered that one of my wife's purses was missing, we realized that this was when it happened. One young man in particular did not seem to want to let my wife pass and I had to physically pull her and push him to get her close to me. The purse he pocketed was the one carrying only ibuprofen, bismuth tablets, and some cotton swabs, the lucky guy. When we did finally make it to our stop we were rewarded with a brief but confusing search for San Paolo. There did not seem to be much signage, and the San Paolo stop on the Metro line is, how should I put this, in an intimidating state. We're not talking graffiti here, which I personally find to be non-threatening, we're talking about a lot of garbage in the street and a whole lot of vendor carts too close to the sidewalk. Which is all in a very real way an unfortunate state of affairs which would be easy to address. Saint Paul's is itself in an excellent state once you get inside. It's a beautiful church celebrating an important apostle. The whole site is well organized and well-documented with informative exhibits and excellent restoration. Perhaps some of the UNESCO funding and the local government effort can be directed to remedy some of these more easy to address concerns."

There were hardly any people here compared to the other places we visited and this is the first thing you notice. It was so nice and peaceful. It was nice to see the services going on, a priest taking confessions and we sat on the pews and looked at it with awe. The ceiling was very beautiful. The entire building is grand. I much prefered this to San Pietro Basilica becuase of how peaceful it was. Personally I think this place is underrated which made it a bonus for us no hoardes or tour groups insight!"
