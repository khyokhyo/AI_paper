(\"Ma-Dey\" meaning second born in Bali)It was our first private tour we have ever taken and we travel quite a bit so I was worried it might go a bit quiet at points... but boy was I wrong. Made is just a huge fountin of knowledge he knew absolutely everything and more! His English is perfect an attitude was spot on! He could not do enough for us to help checking continuously if we was hungry or thirsty.As for the tour itself it was incredible, we have over 200 pictures from a stunning day! Made just seemed to know all the best spots an places we should visit he seemed to know our needs exactly and only just met us! He always had an alertnative option just incase! Everyone we have spoken to since being in Bali cannot believe how much he managed to pack into one day but it seemed to flow effortlessly. I could not recommend this enough and a very special thank you to Made! \"The Nut House! Couple\""

We were picked up at the arranged time and Made the driver took us to all the places we wanted to go plus took us to some places he highly recommended. Nothing was too much trouble and he was extremely helpful and pleasant to be with. Highly recommend booking with Bali Traditional tours and hopefully you will get Made to be your guide."

We helped harvest rice with local farmers, visited a beautiful temple, sampled tea and coffee at a coffee plantation, and gazed at a stunning waterfall. The list goes on.. what really made this entire tour so brilliant was our funny tour guide Ketut Ajus. He made us feel very welcome and encouraged us to ask questions about Balinese culture and traditions. He was very flexible with our requests, including hunting down durian and stopping off at a beautiful Butterfly Park. We made some very special memories today, thank you Ketut :)"

Based on Tripadvisor reviews I emailed Bali Traditional tours and requested a tour of Bali countryside to include the terraced rice fields, Kintamani volcano and lake area, coffee plantation and Tanah Lot Temple. I did not want the tour to include any shopping, museums or other temples. We just wanted to see the beautiful scenery. They put together a very nice, easy paced itinerary which was just what we wanted. We also enjoyed the restaurant they suggested .what I really liked about our guide Ketut Widana was that he had excellent driving skills and very good command of English language. He was a relaxing , peaceful person to be around and took good care of my mother who had mobility issues. Would definately recommend this company and guide and time- permitting will use them agsin before I leave Bali."

            "review": "Good way to see Bali. My sister and i booked 2 day trip with Bali Traditional tour company. Day one we visited tanah lot. the royal temple and the rice terrace. I do recall the trip was suppose to cover the local school and traditional market but we did not do that during the tour. Our guide Ketut speaks good english. He picked us up on time. Perhaps it is because i told him this is not my first time in Bali, he did not explain the history of the monument much.Day 2 we booked trekking and spa tour. Our tour guide, Gusti, was an excellent guide. He is very passionate about his work. Because we missed the traditional market, he brought us to one of the small market and explained the tradition of offering flowers to the god, the purpose of each temple at each locality. He then brought us to a \"only known to the local\" trekking spot where he kindly prepared sun hat, walking stick, cold drinking water, and even cold towels. He was very attentive and care for our safety. I especially liked the experience of asking for god permission before we start our trek on a steeper and more slippery trek. it demonstrate humbleness and gave me a whole new understanding towards balinese spirituality and culture. along the trek, he explained to us how the farmers plant, and harvest the rice. we met few very pleasant farmers along the way. the spa at the end of the trekking was a great ending to the whole experience. all in all, i would recommend this tour company as it is supporting local business and i like the fact that the guides really do enjoy their work."

            "review": "Perfect way to see Bali. We had driver Wyan for 2 days during our 4 day trip to Bali. He was FANTASTIC. He was very timely picking us up from our hotel and was dressed in traditional clothing. He has a nice large vehicle and we were very comfortable. The 1st day he took us up to Ubud to go on a river rafting tour. The drive was almost 2 hours and he was wonderful explaining all about Bali to us on our drive up. He answered all of our questions and we really felt we got to know the culture of the area just by talking with him. Our rafting tour was 2 hours and he was waiting for us and had held us a table for lunch when we returned. After lunch the plan was to just take us back to the hotel, but he asked if we would like to see more of the area. Of course, we said yes! He brought us to traditional rice terraces and hiked around with us and took some great photos of our family. He took us to a beautiful temple. We told him we loved wood furniture and he took us around to lots of furniture shops and even to a wood carving studio where they explained to us about all the different woods they use and how they carve, etc. It was an amazing day!!The 2nd day we used him our plan was to do a downhill bicycle ride. He drove us the 1.5 hours to the start of our ride, once again with fabulous narration along the way. He waited until our trip was over and we had finished our lunch. Then once again he took us on a tour of the area on the way home. We stopped at the most gorgeous waterfall and he was able to get us permission to climb halfway up. He climbed with us and took some amazing photographs of our family.All in all. Bali Traditional Tours, and driver Wyan, helped make our stay in Bali Fantastic!!"

We had a very full day visiting silversmiths, batik and woodcarving workshop, an amazing Temple where Ketut patiently answered all my sons questions! Then onto rice paddy fields and a lovely lunch before heading to Monkey Forest which was fun! Bit of shopping round Ubud and then driven to a great coffee plantation then a gorgeous waterfall. Nothing was too much trouble and we had the most amazing experience. Ketut Ajus is a credit to the company. You couldn't ask for a better guide.

Our driver/guide, Oka, was really knowledgeable and friendly and answered all of our questions. He gave us tips about vendors on the street and made sure we felt comfortable throughout the day. We opted for the Volcano, Home Compound, Rice Terraces, massage, and Water Temple tour, and we enjoyed every minute of it. Oka was also extremely prepared; he had sarongs for us for the temple and umbrellas for the rain! We can't rave enough about how great the value was for this tour. All of the entrance fees were taken care of, water was provided in the car, lunch was included (and the restaurant's food and view were AMAZING), and pick up/drop of from your hotel was set. And the massage that was included at the end was by far the best massage my husband and I got the entire time we were in Bali (and we got a massage nearly every day we were there). I highly encourage using this company and if you can request Oka, all the better!"

Made was enthusiastic all day and was very patient answering our questions. We visited his incle's family compound, a coffe,tea and spice farm, rice terraces, a lovely restaurant for lunch, a very unique temple and artisan villages. Throughout the day, he explained many things about Balinese Hinduism and ways of life in Bali. The country side drive itself was beautiful ( narrow and curved at times) and Made stopped so we could watch some rice harvesting near the roadside. It was a full day and never a dull moment. Made also told us this is a small family company with just 5 employees. We would highly recommend this tour company and Made, our guide."

Our first trip to Bali and a couple of days staying in Kuta we were not sure about the island - congested roads and a shopping mall with the same brands as we could find home in the UK. And then we had a day trip with Yande and the magic happened.We did the Kintamani full day tour (9am - 6pm) that included the full itinerary including the market, home visit, rice fields, coffee plantation, temples and the volcano. But more importantly through our guide we got a personal insight in traditional Hindu family lifestyle and its beliefs and values. As a personalised tour this was very good value and left us with an understanding of the Balinese people away from the tourist hot spots. Recommended."

Made shared so much more of his knowledge it is impossible to repeat here.

He was so friendly and funny and had endless knowledge about Balinese culture and history. We chatted the entire day for hours (which may sound draining) but it was such easy conversation. One of the reasons why I travel is because it allows me to connect with others from all over the world, all different backgrounds. This tour was full of beautiful sights and interesting histories but it was my time that I spent with Gus that will make it unforgettable. Meeting his family, visiting the school he attended as a kid, and sharing lots of jokes in the car were all some of my favorite parts of the day. Thank you Gus for being the best guide. I'm so happy that I can call you a friend!I'll be back, see you soon!!!"

But me and my husband won't expect to find such a lovely and kind person as Widana. He makes our holiday very special and much more beautiful. We booked 3 tours with Bali Traditional Tour (Volcano, Terrace Rice and Ubud) that are definitively very nice with Widana. All way long Widana was very available and took time to answer to all our questions. He explained us many of indu Bali culture, religion and believings. He explained us just HOW TO BE HAPPY. Is just all inside of you, think positive, life is a process to become a better person. Negative thinking ? What for ? Do the best, help other and be happy on what you have without thinking about what you would like to have, because is your way. Widana loves so much his Bali, his culture and his religion that makes you share it. He did his best to make us happy in every way and make our holiday a mystic experience. Just try it. Thank you Widana ! You and your words will stay in my mind for ever. I really advice to book tours with Bali Traditional Tour with Widana of course."

His first question to use was, have you had breakfast. Not only were the shops, and sites he took us to amazing and beautiful, but his intimate knowledge added a unique color and flavor to the places we were visiting. He was not shy to answer any questions, we had about the social interactions, language, religion, and more. He was also very keen on our interest and would offer more insight inline with out interests. He was also our advocate when it came to bargaining at the local markets, and didn't take us only to the more posh and pricy markets. He even picked us fresh ripe guavas from tree at home when he learned that we liked Guava. Ketut is a very intelligent, thoughtful and funny person, and great company.This tour company and Tour guide is strongly recommended. The tour itself was amazing, and thoughtfully put together. We got to see the beautiful rice terraces, visit and fed bananas to the monkeys in the Monkey Forest, taste delicious Lewack coffee (at a fraction of what you would pay for in the states) and teas, learned about a historical Elephant Cave (Gao Gajah) temple, and archeological site, and took in the beauty of a once secluded waterfall, and more. We couldn't have been more fortunate to have found a more wonderful tour company and guide."

We visited an elementary school, cemetery, Lake Batur and volcano, coffee plantation, Gunung Kwai temple, and rice terraces. We were so lucky to visit the Holy Spring Water Temple on such a special day - the Balinese were celebrating the Full Moon Ceremony. The temple was full of people making offerings, bathing in the springs, parading around making music, and dancing. I also really enjoyed visiting Gus' family home and meeting his extended family. It gave us true insight into traditional family home life. We brought a box of school supplies including pencils, glue, erasers, folders, Play Doh, and paper for the elementary school kids. The kids and teacher were very grateful and Gus wouldn't stop thanking us."

Thankfully we had the confirmation in our inbox the next morning shortly before 8am. They did call our homestay however and asked whether the tour could be started half an hour later due to the short notice, of course that was no problem for us. Our guide Oka was right on time so we could start the Bedugul tour. I won't go into details about the touristic sights as you can find information about these anywhere on the net. Instead I will focus on Oka and the great service he provided.My girlfriend was generally sceptical about guided tours, fearing they'd just rip you off, pressuring you to buy stuff at places where they get a commission and that a guide would hardly be more than a driver. She was proven wrong all the way as Oka was very professional and kind. We've met only a few Indonesians during our time on Bali and Lombok whose English was on par with Oka's (although he does have an accent, it's easy to understand). It was also very important to him that we understood that we did not have to buy anything at the stops we made (e.g. coffe plantation). In general he explained a lot about the Balinese culture and answered any questions that we had asked us since we landed on Bali a week before. Definitely worth the money as it was overall a great experience. Thank you Oka!"

So we decided on the suggested dance show, the coffee plantation, artist village, the monkey forest, had lunch right next to the rice paddies (sensational!) - followed by the the waterfall and elephant cave. However, the absolute highlight for us was the visit at Kamong's house - a stunning compound which he shares with his family of 44 (!!) and lots of pets. Our kids (6 & 4 years old) couldn't be happier. Komang speaks good English, loves kids & has a wonderful personality. His inside stories about Balinese daily life and culture were highly entertaining and painted a lively picture of Bali. Can highly recommend this trip to any family who wants to see more than the \"official\" sides of the island. "

Yande spoke English fluently, very clear and understandable, my two teams (17&15) were held captive the whole day - what an achievement.We had a couple of tours in Bali, this one was by far the best we did to get into Balinese culture, we were given an awesome introduction to Hinduism, how people live, make money, shop, sustain themselves, every question was answered thouroughly and passionately. I loved the trip to Yande's own village, the school kids lining up for us was a treat, a visit to his own house was the highlight, how his house was laid out, his chickens, his garden, what the temples meant, why they were arranged, how he carved and painted them himself, his wife, brother and youngest were there, all accomodating and wonderful people - we saw the local markets, Tegalanang rice terraces, coffee plantation, mount kintamani and lake - an absolute treat with a fantastic guide - he deserves a bonus!

This was my 10th trip to Bali and although I know how cheap you can get a driver for a day, its worth spending that bit more money and hiring a specialized tour guide. Having a guide that deals with all the small things from entry fees through to sarongs for temple was a bonus but the real value comes with the history and tradition that our guide Yande was so happy to share. A bonus with this tour is a guided walk through a local market, expect something different here, a visit to a local primary school, a real highlight for us and sharing some local market treats with Yande and his family at his home. One of our must visits on our list was Tirta Empul temple. This is one of the most important temples in Bali because of its holy water that is used for purification by the locals. My wife and I felt comfortable participating in the purification experience with Yand\u2019s guidance to ensure we maintained the required respect that is so important here. This was an absolute highlight of my many visits to Bali. The temple grounds surrounding the natural spring are magnificent and we were lucky enough to see locals preparing for an up and coming ceremony. Regardless of what you decide to tour, the car was very clean and comfortable, drinking water was provided, stop anywhere and as long as you like, Yandes English was very good and would definitely recommend this company.

So if you have a flexible schedule, this is a huge plus! Yande explained the reasoning behind everything we saw in great detail. I really appreciated this insight and background, and it made the sights much more special in my opinion. We also got to wear traditional Balinese wear when entering the holy spring temple, lent to us by him.

We were driven by Made from our hotel to a number of beautiful sites. Starting at the local market and then driven to the spectacular sight of hundreds of Hindu devotees washing and blessing themselves at a nearby temple. Then taken to visit a coffee ( best tasting coffee ever) plantation and dropped of for a very tasty and reasonably priced lunch overlooking a rice paddock . Rounded off by Made taking us to his family home to see how local bali families live. Throughout Made was a joy,so friendly and smiling, a great host and expertly explained the fantastic Bali culture to us simply and with a great sense of humour. A better day out I could barely imagine. I would pay double for this ( As a tight scot I don't say this very often) . You really can't afford to miss this experience and if you are lucky enough to have Made as your driver then the day won't get better."

The emails and phone calls were communicated well and even when we needed to change the date, this was accommodated with no issues.But special mention must go to our host and guide for the day, Yande. What a credit you are for the company. Yande went over and beyond to get us through our busy itinerary and even went and bought us an AUX cable to plug our own music in the car! His knowledge of Bali and the sites we visited were great. We highly recommend this tour company and if possible try and ask for Yande."

A couple of days before the scheduled trip we had to postpone as our son was not well. They had no issues with this and rescheduled as requested. We also indicated that we did not want to go to the Monkey Forest and the price was adjusted down accordingly.On the day our driver arrived on time with a clean and well-maintained car. Our tour guide and driver for the day was Komang. He was friendly, knowledgeable and full of information.At the onset, he confirmed with us what we would like to do for the day and structured the rest of the day accordingly.We went to a local handicraft store which had a great range of souvenirs and Balinese art. We found the prices better than Legian and other touristy areas.Komang took us to a traditional market and was generous enough to buy as local delicacies which were a great touch. His generosity and warmth were on show throughout the day. He even tracked down some Jackfruit that I was keen to try and paid for it himself!We visited the Ubud area and visited a waterfall and coffee plantation.I should have probably requested that we wanted to try lunch at a local restaurant. Instead, we were taken to a very touristy restaurant which was expensive and okay food.A visit to the temple and the rice terrace was fantastic, and we had plenty of time to do some more shopping. We needed some baby supplies on the way back and even though it was getting very late Komang took us to a supermarket.Overall we enjoyed the trip with Bali Traditional Tours. There are cheaper tours out there but the level of personalised service, attention to detail and generosity was worth the extra money.Thank you Komang, you are an asset to your company.Suksama."

From the start to finish this tour was incredible due to our incredible guide Ketut Widana or as he's known by us simply 'Wi'Wi took us to a traditional morning market, silver shop where we could see the process and an art studio. He never rushed us and throughout the drive he was informative and great fun. From there we went to a padi rice field took incredible photos we then started our drive to mount Batu. On the way we stopped at Boni Bali restaurant which was stunning views and delicious food. From there we drove up to the mountain which was breath taking we sore the volcano mountain and sights that I couldn't believe. After we went to a coffee plantation. The staff at the plantation were so helpful and informative and the drinks were amazing! After this we went to a holy spring temple. This was so calming and again simply beautiful. Wi explained everything to us and made the tour so much more interesting. He's also an amazing photographer! We then went to a final temple in the river a walk of 340 steps to get to this temple but Wi was right it was well worth it! On the way home we stopped at a traditional house which was great to see how the people live and again Wi gave us an indepth insight as to family life in bali. I can't thank Wi enough for making our tour so special I would recommend this tour to anyone."

He spoke excellent English, was super friendly and talkative and his knowledge of Balinese culture, religion and history was outstanding.

Ketut also ensured that we missed most of the crowds by taking us to the quieter places first, which we really appreciated. Even though we had some rain on our tour, the scenery and areas we visited were beautiful. The Bedugul tour really gave us a great overview of Balinese life. We especially enjoyed the visit to the traditional market and the temples we visited. Another mention goes to Ketut here for running through the rain to bring us umbrellas! Overall, we would fully recommend this tour and the company. The value for money is outstanding and if we had more time we would have booked more tours with them. Michael and Olivia Harrison"

We visited Ubud on our honeymoon and only had a few days, so we were eager to see and learn as much as possible in two full day tours while avoiding tourist traps. Our guide Yande was the perfect combination of local friend, safe driver, and cultural historian. On top of all this, it was easy to see how he dedicated he is to his professions - being a traditional rice farmer as well as tour guide - while maintaining his family and religious responsibilities. Really puts work life balance into perspective. Yande had endless patience to answer all of our questions and an ever present smile. He was flexible to our schedule and interests, and made extra efforts to ensure we were well fed, watered, and informed about the meanings behind symbols, language, art, culture, food and farming. He was even kind enough to bring us to his home, farm, and his kids' school. Aside from two famous temples and Jatiluwih (rice fields) we visited smaller, local attractions and artists that barely had any tourists. We were stunned by Yande's generous nature and had many funny moments and laughs together. We couldn't have asked for a better local guide and would highly recommend his family-run tour company to anyone visiting Bali."

            "review": "Kintamani Tour. This tour was amazing!! First off, my wife had planned this tour where the only thing we wanted to do was bathe in the Tirta Empul Holy Water Temple, so everything else would have been a plus. The only problem was we had already visited a coffee plantation and went around the traditional market the day before. Well, let me introduce you to Made, who accommodated our wants and needs perfectly! We told him about having seen part of the attractions, as well as some other things we wanted to do instead, and Made had no hesitation to fit in the new plans with ease! THIS IN ITSELF DESERVES THE HIGH RATING I COULD GIVE IT! There's so many tour guides that merely \"stick-to-the-plan\" without any consideration to the buyer. (granted, I should have known before booking, but my wife booked it, what can I say??) So, with Made's suggestions, our tour went like this: Stopped by a convenient store to buy snacks and candies for our second stop... visiting a local primary school. This was more fun than I initially thought; the kids were fun to play with, very cute, and seemed to warm up to visitors easily (maybe because they saw we had candies!). After that, we went to the Holy Water Temple and were able to bathe! Made did an excellent job explaining the traditions and courtesies of the temple as well as taking pictures. He even brought the sarongs and bought towels for us to dry off afterwards. After a tour around the rest of the temple and the springs, we drove to a lookout spot to see Batur Lake and the adjacent volcano. Because we had already been to a coffee and fruit plantation, we went straight to lunch at Boni Bali that overlooks some rice terraces. The timing was perfect because it started to rain as we sat down which gave a wonderful view and air to our lunch. Made explained that he suggested this restaurant as opposed to another spot due to a bad review. As confused as I was to think this kind of service could garnish a bad review, I must say thank you to that reviewer, because this new lunch spot was beautiful! After lunch we skipped the second temple and went from the rice terraces to a traditional Balinese home. We even met with the owner of the company as the family's home we visited was his own's! Very refreshing to see faces instead of names when going through tours with such high praise. Because we had enough time left (because we had skipped a few attractions at our own request) we were able to stop by a silver and gold mining and trading company. There, Made made sure we didn't feel pressured to buy, but when we were ready to, he also made sure we haggled with the prices. All in all, this was one of the most friendly, professional, and enjoyable tours I have been on. So much so, that it made me sign up for a TripAdvisor log-in just so I could write a review on them! I have no problems recommending these professional tour guides to my friends and family!"

There are many great reasons why Bali Traditional Tours is #1 on Trip Advisor, but the main one is that the guides are passionate about giving you the best personal experience that matches your interests and desires. We had an outstanding day with Gusti. He picked us up as planned in a clean, late model, air-conditioned vehicle. We spent the early part of the day seeing the Balinese cultural dance, followed by trips to the waterfall and Ubud Monkey Forest. The time we spent at each stop and the things we did were totally within our control. We took a little extra time to hike to the top of the waterfall, and we really got into the monkeys - no problem. Gusti spent a lot of time telling us about the ways of life on Bali - how girls leave their homes to join the extended families of their husbands and how multiple generations live under a single roof - about how Balinese homes are constructed as part of a compound and the function of each building in the compound.Finally, at the end of the day, Gusti told us that he wanted to take us to a Balinese house to show us many of the things he had shared. When we arrived, we learned that Gusti had actually brought us to his own home where we were able to meet his mother, his children and his grandfather. It was a great personal touch that really made the day special. We started the day with a tour guide but ended it with a friend."

After lunch we visited \"coffee plantation\", Cavatik Agriculture. It is just a coffee shop with some testers which tasted good. Do not buy anything with sugar inside because you will get less of the coffee and the prices are pretty high allready. So basically we visited two temples according to the program and the rest on the program is commission based for the company, as we have been traveling for a while and have been on the tours like this. It is also first time we had a tour which had no lunch included. After visit to the restaurant Oka called his boss and he mentioned something about discount for poor choice of the restaurant, but in the end we paid the amount which is mentioned on the website and no discount.

We particularly enjoyed our final unexpected extra stop at Mengwi's Ogoh-Ogoh Museum, which is full of massive, truly horrifying statues of battling Balinese demons - the kind of place we would never have gone in to without Ketut to lead us there and then explain the story and symbolism behind each figure.From all the favourable reviews, it is clear that Bali Traditional Tours do what they do very well and from the simple booking process, very enjoyable day & reasonable price we couldn't fault them.

We make the Kintamani tour with visit of two temples (Gunung Kawi and Tirta Empul), Tegallalang Rice Terrace and we had a lunch with a view on Kintamani volcano and near lake. This is very common in all trips you can find in Ubud but we also went to traditional Balinese primary school and the most interesting part was visit into our guides homestay. As it was a ceremony in his village we were given local cakes, jams and other food. Also we could meet his wife and rest of the family.

We had a lovely welcome from him and were kindly shown around his family compound and met his family. We visited Pura Tirta Empul Holy Water Temple which is a must do trip for everyone. What an amazing place. We visited a fruit and coffee plantation, saw Kintamini Volcano and Lake Batur... And the whole day was filled with so many facts and so much interesting information from Wi whose passion for Bali and insight into the Hindu religion will remain with us always.

The service and treatment we received was wonderful and so relaxing. More tea and light refreshments completed our visit to the Spa. Wi then drove us back to the hotel. A truly memorable day!"

We both loved the tour!Here are a few highlights of the day tour: he took us to his own traditional Balinese house providing with detailed explanations on Bali household culture at first. We would have not ever had the opportunity looking into local houses without him. We loved it. Then we had a chance to enjoy a great view of Mt. Batur, the well-known volcano in Ubud, on a loft top of the local restaurant that he had a friend with. The view was breath-taking, and we stayed there without any interruptions as it was on the top of a private property. Luckily a Hindu ceremony was taking place at Holy Temple so we had a full glimpse of the ceremony. The last highlight of the trip was the last dinner in Bali on the way to the airport (it was our last day in Bali). We had dinner at a super legit local outdoor restaurant on the street. It was the best ever real local food that we took.I was debating whether we should take a private tour and it turns out to be totally worth it!"

Gusti was amazing, he brought a brand new vehicle whcih was very comfortable, cannot fault this guy at all, he also took us to see his family in a traditional balinese house. This was very educational, the whole day was tailor made to what we wanted and he made sure we got back at the hotel by 4pm which we needed to.

We saw SO much in two days including the Tanah Lot temple, rice terraces, a morning market, the Monkey Forest, Elephant Safari, the Holy Spring Temple, the Royal temple, coffee plantation plus his own home. It was a very busy two days and it would be hard to say which parts I liked the best as they all were amazing. I sure think it would be such an incredible shame to come all the way to Bali and not see all the things that make it like no other place on earth. Thanks Made for two great days and a lifetime of memories !"

Our guide-driver, Komang, was on time to pick us up and the vehicle we used was quite good. We enjoyed the said day trip and so decided to do another tour the next day, the Uluwatu tour. Again, with the same guide-driver, Komang.We truly appreciate the flexibility of the tour agency as we had decided to take the Uluwatu tour at last minute. . Both tours are all well-worth it, interesting and fun. Komang was patient, accommodating and a very good driver. For the Bedugul tour, make sure to walk the rice paddies of Jatiluwin (a UNESCO heritage site) and not just take pictures of it. Taman Ayun temple is impressive. For Uluwatu Tour, the beaches are really nice. So, it's a must to take a dip. Bring some swim wear and a lot of sunblock. The trip to the Uluwatu temple was maybe long but Komang drives fast and efficiently so the trip was quite comfortable"

The answer is yes....it will be the best day you have on the islandYou will then check with your hotel concierge and debate going with them. If you want to pay double for a lesser experience then go for it. Otherwise call Bali Traditional Tours. One phone call and we had arranged a pick up at our hotel for the following dayWe were met by our guide, Wayan, and his driver in a comfortable air conditioned jeep. Itinerary was as follows:Local market - mildly interesting but they were closing up for the daySilver jewellery - be very careful. The sterling silver jewellery is beautiful but unless you negotiate hard it will be more expensive than at home. Aim for 70-80% discountTegenungan waterfall - changed the itinerary to include this. Steep steps to and from the fall but great photo opportunity or place to cool off Coffee and spice plantation - good fun stop. Got to try a number of different teas and coffees in a tranquil settingMount Kintamani - lunch overlooking the breathtaking views. A must seeBali compound - Wayan took us to show us his home and his family. A real honour and a wonderful way to see how the locals liveHoly Spring Temple - my favourite stop.

I will say upfront that our love affair with Nyoman began about 8 years ago when the Bali Gods smiled on us and he turned up as our tour guide on our first visit. We fell in love immediately with his broad friendly smile as he ascertained our Balinese names. Since then he has been an integral part of our many visits and we were delighted and honoured to be some of his first guests when he opened the Day Spa last year - and I posted a glowing review accordingly.We have done every tour on the website and have created our own itineraries as well - however we hadn\u2019t done the Rice Trek tour - Rice field trek, lunch and spa, as my husband\u2019s legs are a bit wobbly ( I\u2019m not an Olympian myself) . We chose to give it a go when Nyoman assured us he had a more gentler alternative. The day turned out to be splendid - we set off on a beautiful sunny Ubud day - Initially the walk was a bit scrambly and muddy however Nyoman was always at our elbow to help guide (and pull) us until we reached a large wide flat concrete path that wound through picturesque green rice fields for rest of the walk. We enjoyed an excellent lunch at a nice restaurant with a lovely view before hitting the spa - and my how that has grown... See my review for spa.Another special & memorable day."

Ketut picked us up from our hotel in Ubud at exactly the time stated and was friendly and helpful throughout. His driving and car were excellent and we enjoyed our experience on the Kintamani tour. We visited a local market, temples, the mountain lake, coffee plantation and Ketut's own home at the end (our favourite part). Ketut spoke excellent English and had a great sense of humor; we learnt so much about Bali and the local culture. Thank you! We will recommend to all of our friends and hope to be back to Bali in the future!"

We actually did many tours before, on Java, Bali and Lombok, but this one was the best! Our guide Ketut Ajus showed us so many nice places, told us so much about the culture and history and cared really nicely for us. The tour was well organised and more then comfortable for us. It started with a traditional market, where Ketut showed and bought us local fruits we didn't know before. Next we went to see some amazing temples and had lunch at a very good and authentic place. Afterwards we saw the volcano and did a coffee tasting at a coffee farm. Ketut told us about all the herbs and spices that grow there (so many new things for us Germans ;) ). And the best part about the trip was that after a amazing day, Ketut showed us his home, where he lives with his parents, his wife and two sweet girls. It was a pleasure spending the day with him! Ask for Ketut when booking a tour, you will love it!Thanks for the amazing day! Alex & Ela"

Brilliant day; picked up at accommodation points, visited coffee growing centre, cafe stop/starting point on mountain top, brilliant local guides/back-up team (incl.van) with us, stops along the way with full explanations of what we would do/ see etc., e.g, meeting a local family and finally, lunch in garden of very talented local artist.

He was very friendly and informative, very willing to share about bali's culture and customs they have. First stop was a look at his living area, in which we gain more insight into traditional living style of a bali household. Next was the volcano attraction which was the highlight of the trip. We get to see a clear view of the volcano without the obstruction of other tourists. For lunch, we get to have lunch among the fields with chickens all around us. A visit to the water temple and the cliff temple was great too. All in all, it was a great experience exploring further into the cultural side of bali (other than the beaches) and I would recommended Komang as a your tour guide!"

They accept USD and local currency in cash. No cards. The guide Gusti is a very enthusiastic and chirpy man who brought us to his home and showed us the traditional Balinese lifestyle. He spoke all along the way enriching us with details of Bali culture. He was also dressed traditionally with a cap and sarong. Our trip was customisable and we had flexibility to revise timings at our discretion. We went to a temple with rock carvings called Gunung Kawi with 300 steps. That was a major workout! Then we drove to the town of Kintamani and saw the volcanic mountain. We saw a traditional market. We then had lunch in the heart of the rice terraces of Ubud and stopped for coffee at a coffee plantation. Gusti even helped us secure the next day's agenda and worked our bookings for adventure sports and spa keeping our preferences in mind. We used Bali traditional tours the next day too for this customised trip. The costs are very reasonable and the guides make it worth every penny. Book this tour now. You will love it."

            "review": "Great customized your with very knowledgable guide!. This was our first time to Bali and visiting from NYC. Our guide, Wayan, was great and very knowledgable. He organized our tour very well and asked out input throughout to make sure we did everything we wanted. He knew the best areas to avoid at certain times so we would be relaxed and avoid the bulk of other tourists, yet we still got to see everything! He chose a great restaurant for lunch that looked out with great views of the volcanos. We had specific souvenirs we wanted to buy and he took us to places he knew that wouldn't rip us off and give us great quality. We were incredibly impressed. We used this service for two days which Wayan accommodated us by taking us from our hotel in Ubud to Nusa Dua while seeing the sites in between. We say he spoiled us, this was our first time using a personal tour guide and we don't think we can use a group again. I strongly encourage reaching out to this tour group when you visit Bali. We will use him again on out next visit!"

We had the most lovely tour guide called Made Midiarsana who spoke such good English and was so informative during the whole day. It was such a jam packed fun day. He took us to the best viewing spot of Kintamani which was at a lovely restaurant where we stopped for lunch. Other parts of the day included visiting a traditional Balinese market which was a real insight to their daily lives, seeing two temples that left us in awe, rice fields and a coffee plantation which again showed us the true Balinese culture and finally to his uncles family home which was a surreal experience as we really got to see exactly how the life is for the Balinese people. All in all we absolutely without a doubt recommend going on a Bali Traditional Tour and request Made as your host or should we say, your friend for the day. Thank you so much for such a cool experience and for showing us around your beautiful country. An experience we will never forget!"

It was a private tour with a great air conditioned car and amazing guide. We viewed the royal palace, Pura Ulun Temple, and the temple on the water up in Bedugul. The guide was helpful, knowledgable, and super friendly. They even let us change our tour date because of rain for no extra charge! the sites are beautiful and the staff professional. The guide even taught us about his religion and family/home life there in Bali. (We LOVE learning about other cultures and his information was extremely welcome.) I learned so much on that tour. USE THIS TOUR COMPANY IN BALI!!!"

We were picked up at our hotel by courteous and friendly Wayan (meaning first born) Suarjana +62812 37236790We then discussed briefly various options that coincided with our interest and our capabilities (not too good with hundreds of steps at age 71). It was obvious that he was really flexible and just wanted a day to make us as happy as possible. Our first stop was the local fruit and vegetable markets where I was able to video the making and filling of the intricate offering baskets and tasting a locally made cake. We dropped into a very interesting and beautiful coffee plantation where you get to taste 8 different hot beverages including, ginger, cocoa, vanilla and Bali coffee. But the high light is seeing the wild civet responsible for the Kopi Luwak. We then made our way up to Tegallallang and had lunch overlooking a spectacular view of the Batur mountain and Batur lake (largest in Bali).  The temple complex of Tira Empul (means holy water spring) is probably most famous and sacred because of its holy water that is used for purification. We witness the unique purification ceremonies which anyone can participate. One unexpected surprise was a luxurious swimming pool previously enjoyed by the colonial elite now home to a huge number of happy giant carp in many colours. However, the hilite of the trip has to be a visit to Wayan's traditional Balinese home where we were treated to its unique design and layout, refreshments, meeting his beautiful daughters and his extensive garden which included many trees and bonsais. He has also recently planted huge plots of vegetables as well as fruit trees including papaya and orange. We exchanged so many stories comparing each other's cultures and lives that it's difficult to believe that we only met a few hours ago."

I sent Bali Traditional Tours an email last night asking about availability for today and had a reply confirming they could fit me in - all within 30 mins of asking. I was picked up promptly by Made who started sharing fantastic information about Bali straight away. We visited the local market where I was able to see the traditional experience - very different to the centre of Ubud. I also had the chance to try some local foods including delicious cakes - yum!The rest of the day continued in such a fantastic way and Made kept sharing interesting information and was very patient with me taking lots of photos as we visited two temples (Tirta Empul and Gunung Kawai), Kintamani, a localcoffee plantation and the rice terraces. He even stopped at the roadside a few times to give me more insight into the rice growing/harvesting process which I said I was interested in. A highlight was visiting a Balinese home at the end of the day. I was very grateful for this insight. I would definitely recommend this trip - whether you're a group of travelling alone like me. Thank you Made for such a wonderful experience!"

This tour allows you to experience authentic Bali, which can sometimes be lost in the more tourist areas of the country. Activities include visiting the Spring Water Temple, Ballenise coffee plantation, rice plantation and visiting a traditional Balenise house and family (a personal highlight). The tour guide, in our case Made, ensured that the experience was thoroughly enjoyable and unique and was full of knowledge and passion for his country. A lovely man who couldn't do enough for us throughout the tour. I cannot recommend this experience enough, it is a must do when visiting Bali and this is undoubtedly the tour company that should be used! We will always be grateful for this experience."

On our second last day in Bali we booked this day trip with Bali Traditional tours and the trip surpassed our expectations so much.We stayed in the Seminyak Beach resort and from emails back and fourth we settled on a tailored trip through Ubud. Wayan meet us at the hotel and we set off on our trip which was to see the monkey temple, Tagalalang rice terrace, Pura Tirta Empul, Coffee Plantation, Lunch stop, Coffee Plantation, Tegenungan waterfall and a traditional Balinese house. Every stop was brilliant.Wayan was a great tour guide and driver. I would also add he takes good pictures and he held onto our possessions when going into the waterfall and the holy springs at the temple. We felt safe at all times with Wayan's driving, he beeps at every blind turn and is composed on the crazy roads around Bali. He speaks great English and he knows so much about his culture and the Balinese history, he even asked us questions and no doubt learned abit about Scottish culture too. He took loads of pictures for us and even took us to the best places to take pictures at each location. He is also very flexible on where you visit and what you do, the trip isn't booked as under one ticket so if there is something you want to miss just say and he can take you anywhere you want or suggest alternatives for you. For tea or coffee lovers the plantation is a must do, they give you the best selection of locally made tea and coffee and they have a shop to buy your own which we made full use of.We had a truly brilliant day out and it's one that we will never forget. Thank you Wayan"

The scenery was absolutely beautiful and even though it took two hours it didn't feel that long because we were enjoying it so much. We were a bit nervous at first about getting out to swim in the river but the water was very refreshing and cool, it was a highlight you should definitely try. The best part of the tour though was our driver Jaya who picked us up and dropped us off, he was very friendly, spoke great English and was very happy to answer all our questions about Balinese and Hindu culture. It made the two hour each way drive very enjoyable and we learned a lot about the local culture. The only thing I would say that might make the rafting tour unsuitable for some is that you have to go down and up a lot of stairs to get to and from the river. It wasn't a problem for us but it might make the tour unsuitable for anyone with certain health issues so might be best to ask before booking.Thanks Bali Traditional Tours and Wayan and Jaya for a great day out :)"

Our guide was Oka. He was absolutely fantastic! We did other tours with other companies and he was by far the best! He really went the extra mile in every place we visited, to ensure we experienced everything, including buying us some delicious local fruits from the market we visited, as we'd never tried them before, such a lovely gesture. He also took us to his own house to see the way a typical Balinese family lives which was so great! We met his family and it was so interesting to get that insight, he was so warm, open and friendly. Oka's driving was also great, very safe (unlike some taxi drivers!) and we felt completely at ease. The tour has the perfect mix of elements and a great pace. We really came away feeling we'd seen a lot of what Bali has to offer. The price is really worth it, as it made an incredible difference to have such a professional guide with us as we saw and experienced many things that we wouldn't have known about or been able to do on our own with a driver.

My boyfriend and I had a limited amount of time in Ubud, so we decided to book a tour in order to get a good overview of all of the nearby attractions. We booked the Kintimani Tour (day tour) through Bali Traditional Tours, and I'm glad that we did because Wayan was an awesome tour guide. Our hotel offered a similar tour, but they do not speak English as well as Wayan does. He was able to understand and answer all of our questions regarding all sorts of obscure topics. In addition, we were not interested in doing the luwak coffee plantation, so he was able to customize our tour for us. Wayan was also a very good driver that made us feel very safe in his car even going around winding narrow roads with two-way traffic.By far the most special and unique part of the experience was being taken to the traditional Balinese family compound, which was Wayan's house. His gracious and kind wife treated us to young coconut water, peanut fritters, and cakes that she had made for their Saraswati offering that morning. We also met his curious daughters, who also knew some English and asked us some questions. Overall, it was a wonderful experience to meet Wayan's family and see how a normal Balinese family lives.We lucked out on our tour, since we booked during Saraswati which was a holiday for most Balinese and many of them were dressed traditionally and praying and making offerings at the temples that we visited. We truly appreciate Wayan taking the time out of this sacred day to spend with us. Tickets for the temples were included in the price, with the exception of an additional temple (Goa Gajah) that we visited with him since that was an unplanned stop. Lunch at Kintimani is a buffet and includes coffee and tea, but other drinks are not included in the buffet price. Wayan was aware that the Tegallalang rice paddies had recently been harvested, so he took us to other rice fields as well to see the view and also watch the rice being planted by the locals.Wayan did everything possible to make sure we had the best experience we could have had, and went out of his way to invite us into his home and allow us to meet his family. We had a wonderful day and it has been a highlight of our vacation so far. I definitely recommend booking this tour with Wayan, and additional ones if you have the time."

The second day started and ended in Ubud with a visit to a traditional Market, tegenungan waterfall, Gunung Kawi temple , coffee and spice plantation, Holy spring temple. Our tour guide was a young man named Made who was knowledgable and passionate about his country, full of little pieces of trivia and quite funny! He is a lovely person and we can't recommend him enough. One of the highlights of the tour was a visit to the Balinese compound which we were a little dubious of but we realised it was Made's home and we were made to feel very welcome by his family and neighbours and it was a beautiful place to experience. We've had many tours in different countries and it really is worth getting an experienced tour guide rather then a random driver, especially someone as good as Made!"

Gus gave us the perfect amount of privacy and alone time and also gave us so much information on the country and culture but always made it fun and funny! I can't put into words how wonderful Gus was, he was the kindest man I have ever met and knew exactly what to say and do. I was quite scared to go to monkey forest but he was so kind and caring and I always felt so safe. He is really funny and speaks amazing English but is always trying to learn more which is so sweet. He apologises all of the time for small things like if he doesn't understand something or if he overtakes a car which is so sweet. He is just so lovely and this tour wouldn't of been the same without him showing us everywhere. He kept calling my boyfriend 'Jake' 'jack sparrow' the whole trip which made us always laugh. We bought him a bintang vest when we went shopping because he said how much he loved it and he was so grateful!P.S if you get Gus as your tour guide ask him to say 'salesman', we taught him how to say it and it was so funny because he couldn't pronounce it properly, so if you want to smile and be made laugh ask him to say 'salesman'.I would highly recommend this tour and Gus too!

He was so patient, informative, gunny, and all around knowledge and happy to answer any questions we had about their culture.Their service and how they treat their customers met beyond my expectations. If it's your first time I'm Bali I would not hesitate to recommend a guided tour. There's so many places spread throughout the island, and it's nice to have a local guide tell you and teach you about their customs and culture. Not to mention that driving in Bali is not for the faint of heart!! The roads are small (some not kept very well) and lots of motorbikes swerving around.One other unscheduled stop that really made it more special; we were invited and we're able to witness a village ceremony that normally happens only every 5 years!! Amazing! I'm glad Nyoman asked if we wanted to stop, and also grateful to those who invited us in so generously!!Special thank you to Nyoman for making it one of the best days during our vacation to Ubud!!Pros:-Range of tours to choose from-Service and friendliness of staff is exceptional-Air conditioned vehicle -Price for what you get is a great deal-Their spa is a must visit. Relaxing and the massage was top notch.-Family owned business-Cons:None that I can think of!! Tips:-Book a spa. The massages are amazing, prices are great, and service is wonderful. Can't eave enough and it's definitely worth it after a long tour!!-Don't buy any coffee or tea at the plantation stop. It does not taste the same when you get home!! Prices are also way too high.-If there's an unexpected stop, and you guide asks you, definitely stop!! You never know what you'll get to experience."

We had 3 great days with this tour company - the first day we did the Kintamani tour, the second day we went rafting and then shopping, and the third day we combined the Bedugul with the Tanah Lot tours. All were great experiences, and the prices were low. If you have three days available, I would recommend following this itinerary."

I frequently right reviews listing the pros and cons of whatever operation I\u2019m reviewing, however, for this review I don\u2019t have any negatives to list. Both days were excellent and we had a wonderful time. Our guide was Gusti (Gus for short) and he was excellent in every way. We visited a traditional Balinese market, went to the Taman Ayun Temple, ate lunch after walking through the Jatiluwih rice terraces, visited Tanah Lot Temple and viewed a beautiful waterfall after shopping at a batik factory. Throughout our travels Gus explained Balinese culture, traditions and the Hindu faith. In every regard Gus exemplified kind, gentle and reverent values that shaped his personality. In a very real sense, getting to know Gus was as much of the tour as were the places we visited. On the second day we visited his \u201cfamily compound\u201d and met his parents and two daughters. We loved learning about how his extended family lives together. Gus shared more information with us than we\u2019ll ever remember, but we loved learning as much as we could.As far as the tour mechanics worked, Gus met us at our hotel at 9:00 AM both days. We traveled in a nearly new small Toyota SUV (similar to a RAV4 in the US) and the day concluded between 4:00 and 6:00 PM. Gus customized the schedule to accommodate reservations we\u2019d made for an afternoon massage\u2026 We enjoyed the places he suggested for lunch. We enthusiastically recommend Bali Traditional Tours -"

I'm not usually keen on writing reviews, but my boyfriend and I both thought that our experience is worth a review. This was our first time in Bali and the tour we did with Bali Traditional Tours was the first tour we did in Bali. Let's just say that this set the bar real high for all the other private tours we did. We believe that Gus was definitely the major highlight of our experience. He is extremely enthusiastic, friendly, he is very fluent in English, and above all he is a really genuine person. We learned a lot about the Balinese culture from Gus! He was always giving us mini lessons and pop quizzes which made the car rides really enjoyable. Throughout the rest of our trip we would always come across things that reminded us of Gus's lessons, which would always put a smile on our faces :). Also, they're great at making sure that we are able to get our photo taken at all the prime spots. We also had lunch at a small restaurant by the rice fields and the food was on point! Overall we had a very amazing and memorable experience, and we would 100% recommend Bali Traditional Tours to everyone! This is definitely the company you would want to book your tours with in Bali :)"

We did 2 day tours (Ubud / Monkey Forest day 1, hike through rice fields followed by lunch and spa day 2). The hiking was a bit more adventurous than we had anticipated (very muddy and high grass navigated thru), but made for excellent pictures and well deserved spa treatment afterwards. The spa was extremely clean and luxurious. The Ubud tour was also a very good overview of Ubud - we went to a Balinese silver shop (and purchased many gifts), waterfall, temple, Monkey Forest, had a luxurious lunch overlooking rice fields / in our own hut, and ended the day with a visit to Gusti's personal Balinese home. Great way to experience the cultural side of Bali, would definitely recommend and do again if have the opportunity to go back to Bali!"

Wear hiking shoes (I only had a pair of old converse on thinking it would be a easy hike). 2. Put bug spray on.3. This is a moderate difficulty hike."

I didn't realize until the day before and made the guide come all the way out to our hotel for no reason. I felt terrible about it but they were extremely nice and professional. They even let me reschedule for the next day and never made me feel worse about it. So thumbs up for the kindness and professionalism!For the actual tour, we did a custom tour (they are also very flexible) where we visited a Balinese market, tellalagang rice terrace, monkey forest, spa, and tanah lot for sunset. It was very very well done. Our guide, Made, made us feel comfortable right from the beginning because he is a very genuine and nice person. He truly just wants his clients to have a good time. Honestly, I wasn't very interested in going to a lot of the places during our tour (my wife wanted to go to most of these places) but Made made it a great and fun experience. He was also able to fulfill my desire to try Babi guling and had no problem with switching up the lunch destination. Also, he is very knowledgeable and I feel like I learned so much about Balinese culture from him.If you come to Bali, you should definitely experience the \"true\" Bali and not just the beaches and the resort. Bali Traditional Tours lets you experience so much in just one day, I highly recommend booking a tour with them."

We have spent a cheerful day with our guide Gusti, a very smart and knowledgable young man always with a lovely smile and considerate for all you need as a guest. He speak wonderful English as it is very easy for us as a non-native English speaker to understand. We had the Kintamani tour as our choice and found that the overall experience was worthy for our cost to this trip (which is not cheap though). Our trip started from visiting a local market in which you could feel the real sense of the daily life of Balinese people for their food and religion offering. Then during the visit of a local public primary school, you would be surrounded by those excited and crazy pupils and able to had a general idea of the education curriculum in Indonesia. The coming two temples, Pura Gunung Kawi (Cliff on the Mountain Temple) and Pura Tirta Empul (Spring Holly Water Temple) would brought you into the atmosphere of great history and sacred religion ceremony. The panorama view of Lake Batur and Mount Batur (active volcano) is more than astonishing. The Tegalalang Rice Terrace is worthy for spending longer time to explore. Not only for the view recognized by UNESCO in Heritage List, but also for the subak system and local organization in community who plays better role than government. In the end, you would be welcomed to visit the local residential Balinese house of their staff and learn more about residential architecture. BTW, it is worthy to consider their Ubud Traditional SPA, which is the No. 2 spa in Ubud in Tripadvisor, and we feel as the best spa experience in Bali so far. However, there is still some tips and reminders for you to pay attention in the trip: 1. For lunch, choose by yourself, NEVER FOREVER be led to the Indonesian buffet restaurant, called Tepi Danau, Rumah Makan, which is one of the worst food we ever have in Bali. Do not let the view of Lake Batur outside the eating table fools you - it is everywhere in that area in any restaurant, you can find much better one with less cost. 2. If you are an animal lover, DO NOT choose Luwak coffee. Your purchase is supporting animal cruelty on civets, who have been forced to swallow much more coffee than their need in the wild, and being kept in cages forever and teased for entertaining visitors even they are nocturnal animals. Save the time from this coffee shop for Tegalalang Rice Field. Overall, Bali Traditional Tour is very professional and worth to choose as day tour guide in Bali."

Thank you Gusti!The tour covered a lot of ground and we were going pretty much non stop from our 8am hotel pick up. This was not a bad thing by any means, as it meant we were able to view quite a bit of Ubud including the very interesting and beautiful Elephant Temple and visit some quality stores and artisans. Our lunch stop at Bebek Tebasari was also very picturesque. Our earlier start also enabled us to go to the Barong Dance in the morning, which is a must in order to learn a little more about Balinese spirituality and culture. Our final stop, visiting a Balinese house, provided further insight into the day to day way of life of the Balinese people and capped off a truly memorable and fascinating day.   "

He took us through the whole process and helped us to complete all of the rituals before entering the holy water fountain area.

Made was a safe driver and extremely friendly and helpful to my mom, who has great trouble walking and my elderly grandmother who was also with us on our visit. We loved Made so much we hired him to take us from Ubud to the Lovina area some days later.

The children gave us a few high fives and waved us off after about 30 minutes.We then stopped off at a village local wet market and 'Made' explained the way Bali life worked, took us to interesting stalls where we tried some local delights and learnt about the daily offerings made by every Balinese person. We then took in a coffee plantation, had an amazing organic lunch, walked through rice terraces and lastly we were invited into a local Balinese house. Here we met Grandam, some of the families children, said hello to some oinky friends out the back and learnt how life, love and ceremony all go hand in hand in Bali.This tour was perfect for us and I would highly recommend everyone try it out.

It was a great way to get acquainted with Bali and learn about the culture. Our guide was Ketut and he was so great! He spoke English very well and explained everything as we went. He took us to a family compound, traditional market, Taman Ayun temple, Coffee Plantation, Jatiluwih Rice Terraces, and Tanah Lot Temple for sunset. We really enjoyed our time on the tour and getting to know Ketut. He was so friendly and fun to talk to."

I found the Bali Traditional Tours in Trip advisor and I booked the \"Begudul Tour\" for the 13/04/2016. Oka Gusti came to my accomodation at time (I booked for 8 a.m.) by a big and beautiful car with air conditionner and water bottle. This guide is THE BEST GUIDE EVER !!! Very nice and funny, you can feel how much he likes his country and his culture. His english is also very good and easy to understand ! I learnt a lot about the balinese culture, religion, life, economy, food, ... And I also saw most of the interesting and beautiful places in Bali ! It was exactly what I expected for my short holidays in Bali. So thank you to Bali Traditional Tours and espacially \"Matur Suksama\" to Oka Gusti, the guide with the biggest heart !Good luck :)Lea"

Our tour started with the on time pick up from our hotel. Then we stopped at a weave shop and got to see the natives make bags, clothing, and other items. Next was a temple where we watched a traditional balinese performance. Before going to the rice terrace we stopped at a local market and took a quick tour into the shops the locals shopped at. Once we got to the rice terrace we had time to take pictures and also walked around it if we wanted to. Unfortunately for us was my girlfriend was not feeling well that day so we didn't walk in the rice fields and after the lunch we headed back to the hotel. the whole time Wi was amazing and caring. he was very attentive as he kept checking on her the the whole way back to our hotel. he even offered to take us to a pharmacy to pick up some medication if needed. although we didn't get to finish the tour and experience the amazing spa that I read about in other reviews I felt Bali Traditional Tours was great and well worth it. highly recommend."

Our tour guide was Wi and he was the best, we were picked up at our hotel on time and started our tour with Wi trying to teach us a few key phrases of the Balinese language and a regular day in Bali life, the types of food they like to eat and about his family he loves his life and job and it shows in his enthusiasm showing us all the sites of the area.Our tour consisted of visiting 2temples, coffee plantation, weaving shops , silver shop, woodcarving and lunch in the rice terraces, a traditional Balinese home and ended with a massage at the spa. Let me start with the temples what an amazing experience to get a glimpse in their belief of the temples it was so pretty and Wi was great explaining the history of the temples. Next was the shops we visited and to see how the products are made, the coffee plantation was beautiful all the plants are beautiful and it was interesting to learn and see how coffee is made and the tasting at the end of the tour was great to be able to sample all the different types of coffees. Lunch was at a amazing place food was good and the view was amazing we were very high up in the jungle looking over the rice terraces. Next we were on to the spa , what a great experience the area was beautiful and the massage was great after was our ride back to the hotel we were sad that the day had come to an end but we have great memories.Hopefully we will visit Bali again and have Wi show us the surf spots.Disappointing to read negative comments about this company after spending the day with them what a great tour company very professional, accommodating to what we wanted to see on the tour, never rushed us at any of the stops, no problems with communicating speaks English fluently. We would recommended this company to anybody who is traveling to Bali a must do.Congratulations Wi on the new addition to your family, you are a great person maybe on our next tour we can visit your family.Terima Kasich, til kunjungan berikutnya "

            "review": "Great Balinese hospitality from this family business . We booked two day tours early in our 2-week trip to Bali and discovered so much about Balinese culture and history from our knowledgeable and kind host/tour guide/driver Ketut (which we found out means 4th-born). We did the trekking and spa tour on Day 1 and the shopping and spa tour on Day 2. Both days were really fun and Ketut's English is so good that we couldn't help but keep talking to him all day in the car! The trekking day involves trekking through the rice fields and some jungle areas - we were lucky as it had been dry but make sure you wear suitable shoes. If it has been raining, you have young children or are not sure-footed, request the easy trek which is less adventurous but perhaps safer as it is paved rather than jumping over streams and climbing up river banks! The shopping tour involved visiting various craft villages in the Ubud area and there is no obligation to buy but you genuinely want to support local trade so bring your credit card, especially for the silver and wood handicrafts. On both days, we went to the Ubua Traditional Spa run by Ketut's cousin and the staff were so friendly and the massages just what we needed. We enjoyed it so much that we returned later in our trip to have the Royal Ubud massage (2 therapists each). The tours were also flexible and we paid extra to go to the temple Tan Ah Lot for the sunset on one day, with Ketut also helping us to buy some local goodies from a night market. Overall, we really appreciated the heart that goes into this family business and by learning about the Balinese customs, temples and traditions, we felt that we really understood the island much better, as well as meeting some genuinely kind local people. Suksma - thank you, Ketut!"

I was on my first ever solo trip in Bali and after spending 4 days in Seminyak, i decided to take up a day tour and end my trip in Ubud as my next destination. We began at 9 am and Made, the most wonderful tour guide you could get, welcomed me at my hotel lobby with an extremely warm smile. I was slightly worried about being on my own but Made makes you feel extremely comfortable! I took up the Kintamani tour and our drive to the first destination was quite far off but not for a minute was i bored or quiet in the car! Made is a great conversationalist and taught me so much about their culture and ways of life that apart from the touristy places we visited, I learned the most about Bali during my Kintamani tour with him!We first went to a holy water temple followed by lunch at the Kintamani volcano and then great coffee at the coffee plantations! We were at our own pace and even though we covered so much, it wasn't rushed at all. We end the tour with a visit to a Balinese house where I met with Made's maternal grandparents and cousins. The house was beautiful and spending a day with Made and Bali traditional tours was one of my best decisions of the trip! A must do! :)"

It was the first time my partner and I had visited Bali and I made sure that this was the first review I would write about during our stay in this amazing part of Indonesia. I had read reviews about 'Bali Traditional Tours' and saw how many people had raved about them, which made me decide to book a Bedugul Tour with this company. This was a full day tour which involved visiting the Bali markets, the Royal Temple, Coffee Plantation, Jatiluwah rice terraces and finally the Ulun Danu Bratan temple in Tabanan. We were promptly picked up by Madeh (apologies if I had spelled that wrong!) from our resort and escorted to our car for the day. As soon as we met him, there was just an aura of joy and excitement with him that made us immediately feel very comfortable. Throughout the tour, Madeh was very informative, descriptive and helpful. He answered all the questions we had about the Balinese culture and filled in a lot of the gaps in our knowledge of it. He allowed us to try some of the fruits of Bali, e.g. Mangosteen and snake skin fruit, which were both in season and very sweet. We tried different Balinese desserts as well during our trip to the market, which gave us some much needed sugar for the day. He adhered to my request of trying some 'warung' food, which had 'Babi Guling' (suckling pig) and it was delicious! Our visit to the temples as well as the rice terraces were very memorable and he even took photos for us along the way. (Madeh takes very good photos by the way, making each one look almost like a postcard. Ha!). We got back to the hotel at around 6pm and before we paid, we even requested if he could drop us off at a specific beach so we could watch the sunset, which he gladly agreed to do so. It was hands-down, THE BEST tour I have been on, and Madeh made it such an enjoyable trip, that I just had to write a rave review like all the others. You cannot go wrong with picking this company for any of their tours. They really want you to experience the best of Bali as best as they can. I will definitely book with them again when we return."

As we wanted to go to a good restaurant, besides the typical tourist restaurants on the second day, he recommended a organic restaurant next to the Kintamani Volcano. He's a very good listener, bcs we mentioned \"local and organic\" just once and that was actually the day before. Also you want to go shopping in the places were the true local people do that? Just ask him, he can get you there! Result: Next time Bali and especially Ubud is nothing without him! Thank you Made for the wonderful 2 days!"

It wasn't just the places we went but the personal touch that he added to the day.The day started at the local market with all of the Balinese getting their provisions for the day. There we were able to taste a mangosteen and a sweet treat made from rice flour and coconut. Both were delicious. We were also able to meet some of the local sellers. Very kind people.From there we visited woodcarving, silversmith, and batik shops. I always love purchasing beautiful pieces from the Balinese artisians and today did not disappoint! In between shops Nyoman answered our many, many questions and joked around with us. He was also very interested in our lives. Lunch was at a restaurant over looking the beautiful rice terraces. Absolutley breathtaking. Not only was the view spectacular but the food was delcious as well. Everyone enjoyed their meal but the real highlight was the black rice pudding for dessert.During our conversations we talked about Lewak coffee because some of our group hadn't tried it before. Nyoman made sure that he added a stop to the coffee plantation to our day so we could try it. This was a huge bonus because not only were the coffee and tea samples delicious but the view there was more spectacular than at the restaurant!Off we went to his family spa called Ubud Traditional Spa. We each had the Royal Ubud Massage. There are no words to describe how amazing this was. It was a 4 hand massage for 90 minutes. It went way too fast! It was hands down one of the best massages I've ever had.At this point we were 2 hours over but Nyoman was kind enough to take us to his family home so we could see it. We were so blessed to be able to meet his parents, uncles, brothers, wife, and kids and see how they live. They could not have been more gracious considering it was 8:00pm.I can not say enough about Nyoman and his family business. If you are considering any type of tour please consider using Bali Traditional Tours. Not only are they excellent tour guides, but they are good people too."

Our driver was the wonderful Ketut who was so kind and polite and knowledgeable. He taught us so much about the beautiful people of Indonesia their culture and traditions. Ketut holds the traditions of Ubud and his village very close to his heart and he shared much of this with us. We asked him many, many questions as he answered so well. I feel so much richer for the experience. We booked on the full day Ubud & Environs tour but Ketut allowed us to change bits and pieces of it to cater to exactly what we wanted to do as we had seen a few places on the tour already. They are very flexible with your requirements. The day was brilliant and topped off by going to see where and how he lives. We also met some of his family including his adorable niece and Nephew of whom he is very proud. On top of all this his car is immaculate and he is a wonderful and very safe driver. In addition they also do transfers and it was MUCH cheaper than our hotel so we also booked him to take us from Ubud to Seminyak. This way we could also ask him more questions! I was really sad to say goodbye to him and hope to see him again someday soon! In addition his family also own the Ubud Traditional Spa which you can incorporate into your tour. I highly reccommend this also. It is stunning and the staff are so lovely and courteous. It is one of the best I have been to. The whole family are the most wonderful people and you too will be glad you met them. You really must book."

He was very professional, a good driver as well as guide, and didn't mind that I stopped to take a million pictures. The stops along the way were well chosen and it was cool to be able to see and learn about Ketut's family compound at the end of the tour. I highly recommend their family-run tour company!"

I have found them through Tripadvisor and being ranked #1 was no joke. The package was very affordable for a group of 4 people. Our tour guide, Gusty (Gus for short) was amazing. Informative, friendly and funny, we had no problems warming up to him and his stories of Bali. We've taken the Ubud and Environs tour and learned much about the culture and people of Bali, and we were even introduced to his home and family to see how a traditional Balinese family is. Gus had definitely made a difference in our tour and it was definitely the highlight of our trip. Thanks Bali Traditional Tours! Will definitely try a new package when we return."

My husband and I were looking for a tour that was going to show us the \"real\" Bali, not \"tourist\" Bali.I found Bali Traditional Tours online and was immediately drawn to the \"Volcano, Lunch and Spa\" full day tour.Our Tour Guide, Gusti, picked us up from the Resort at 9am and our journey began. Before I continue with my review, I have to talk about Gusti. This lovely young man was incredible. His English is very good and he spent the whole day educating my husband and I on life in Bali. We learnt about the caste system, religion, the Balinese way of living and the education system. The passion Gusti displays for his job and the love he has for the culture and people of Bali was so infectious that I was almost ready to pack up my life in Australia and move to Bali by the end of the tour!!Thank you Gusti, for being the most professional, passionate and gracious tour guide I think I have ever met on my travels over the years.Our first stop was to a traditional market place where the Balinese buy their food. This was an incredible experience. We learnt so much about the shopping habits of the Balinese from Gusti. We were the only tourists in this particular, traditional, Balinese village and it felt good to experience the 'real' Bali.Our next stop was to Pura Tirta Empul Holy Water Temple where we witnessed both Balinese and tourists bathing in the holy waters to cleanse and purify themselves. Witnessing this bathing ritual was incredible, as was Gusti's stories about how the spring waters came into existence.We then went to have a beautiful lunch in Tegallalang Village overlooking rice fields. The restaurant served very nice food and it was a very peaceful spot for lunch. When we arrived it started raining and this just made our lunch experience even better as we sat on a lovely verandah looking down over rice fields amongst the mist of the rain.Our next stop was a visit to a coffee plantation. We really enjoyed this. We got to taste test lots of different teas and coffees and were educated on the process of making coffee. The plantation was beautiful, feeling like you were a milion miles away in a heavily, vegetated, tropical forest!! We did try the Luwack Coffee and in terms of taste, I found it very comparable to greek or turkish coffee.We then headed to Kintamani Village to view the volcanoes and Lake Batur. Another breathtaking experience, with Gusti discussing the history of the volcanoes and the village.Our next stop was to a Balinese compound to observe how Balinese people live. I was fascinated by this and to be honest, it was this part of the tour that was my sole reason for booking. To be able to walk into a compound and see how the Balinese construct their homes and temples for their extended family members was truly fascinating.Our final stop was to Ubud Traditional Day Spa. What a perfect way to end the day. I have already written a separate review for this Day Spa and I must say, I was seriously impressed with both the quality of massage and quality of facilities.Feeling relaxed and fabulous, it was time for Gusti to drive us back to Legian. I am so pleased to have taken this tour and even more pleased to have been in the company of Gusti who has enriched our lives through the teachings of the Balinese culture and way of life."

My Mum and I took a one day Tamah Lot tour with Bali Traditional Tours in January 2016.We very much enjoyed our day with Asana our guide. We asked to be collected in Sanur (from the Nusa Lembongan boat dock) and dropped at a hotel in Ubud. The company accommodated this and our guide Asana was waiting for us when we got off the boat. We felt it was efficient way to avoid losing a day in transit.Asana was friendly, courteous, and taught us lots about Balinese culture and family life. The car was clean and comfortable.We enjoyed the visit to the Tamah Lot temple and the Royal Palace. The highlight was visiting Asana's home, where we met his sister in law. The Balinese live in large family groups and dedicate a large area of their homes to shrines, very different from the Western way of life.The only part of the tour I did not enjoy was the visit to the coffee plantation. After our \"free tasting\" we got a very hard-sell and the products were extremely expensive. I told the tour operator and they said they would visit different coffee plantations in the the future.We were very tired at the end of the tour. They are by their very nature road trips, and the Bali has fairly heavy traffic so there was a lot of time on the road. It was definitely a very worthwhile day."

They were flexible on making a slight change to the Kintamani Tour itinerary so that my friend whose first trip to Bali, included a trip into the plantation to try the Luwak coffee. Our guide Gus (Gusti) was punctual for our 9am pickup, and we spent our day in safe hands through the long drives to/fro our hotel which was important seeing that some folks had their own rules on the road :) Gus spoke great English, articulated the history of the attractions really well, and immersed us into local culture at the markets and a traditional Balinese family home. The hike back up from the UNESCO-site Gunung Kawi Temple wasn't as pleasant under the midday heat but he was incredibly encouraging and constantly checked to ensure I was feeling okay thereafter. The only bad bits were the bumpy roads and the scorching heat but it wasn't so bad with Gus' jokes :) I would highly recommend this tour and guide."

We learned so much about the predominant Bali Hindu culture, food and saw some marvellous sites. Often there were tourists who would also stop and listen while Ketut spoke. You are well looked after, these are easy going tours, although the waterfall in Ubud had a bunch of steps which was hard going for our legs that were worn out by white water rafting on a different tour (different company). Ketut takes some excellent photographs with your camera, and patiently waits while my shutterbug wife and I exhaustively snap images of the photogenic sites.We were based near Tanah Lot so there was a small additional charge for the pick up. Ketut was happy to negotiate a reasonable starting time.If you do Ubud then I would highly recommend doing the associated Ubud Traditional Massage in the evening."

Unfortunately , my wife slipped in the rice fields, fractured her ankle and this effectively ended our planned holiday just 6 days in. She needed a wheelchair and we had to cut short our holiday so missed Vietnam and the jungle in Borneo. It was very difficult to get around and impossible to visit much of what we had hoped to see. A cautionary note-Take care if it is wet and slippery."

Gus was young, personable and obviously loved his country. He was waiting at the cruise port and took us straight to his car. We visited peaceful temples, a busy market and green countryside, on our way to the incredible UNESCO heritage rice terrace. This bowl-shaped area is huge and beautiful, producing most of Bali's rice crop.Gus took us to a local restaurant for a traditional lunch and we then walked thru the terrace, where we saw farmers working the fields - as he expects to do when he is older and works on his family's small farm. We drove on to the climax of the tour - the amazing Tanah Lot Temple. This temple is built in the sea, just off a beach with stunning views of the sunset. We parked up and walked thru a shopping area full of tourist stuff to reach the temple and its small counterpart,built on the rocks above the cove. An incredible feat of architecture, it dominates the entire area and would be worth the trip on its own.We finally got back to the ship almost 12 hours after we left - tired but happy. I would recommend this company to anyone wanting a top day and great value for money. If you get Gus to drive you, you really are on a winner."

Well...We got so much more than just a guided tour.Gusti started the day by taking us to a local market in a nearby village. We got to see how and what the Balinese purchase on a daily basis. Gusti even bought us some Snake Fruit to try. We visited a wood carving center, an Art Gallery with hundreds of paintings and,a Jewelry Store and a Batik store. We happily purchases items from each store as we felt comfortable with the prices and quality of our purchases.We had lunch at a hidden little restaurant overlooking the Tegalalang Rice Terraces. It was pleasant and relaxing stop with a lovely view of the terraces. We enjoyed a great couples Message at Ubud Traditional Spa (see my review of Spa itself) before heading back to our hotel.The most amazing part of our day came early in our day for when Gusti took us to visits his family home. My husband and I both studied Cultural Anthropology and were eager to see how Indonesians live. Gusti's family compound is nothing like our home In the USA. During our visit we met several family members including his wife, two little girls, a cousin and his Grandparents. We left feeling very guilty about how spoiled and lucky we are to live the way we do.Our tour was supposed to end about 4:30 but we did not arrive back at our hotel until almost 6:30. No extra costs was incurred even though we were late due the time we spent shopping. The tour service has comfortable air conditioned vans but the most important aspect of the tour was Gusti.Ubud Traditional Tours also picked us up at Benoa Cruise Terminal and dropped us off at the International Airport in Denpasar. It was easy and convenient booking with them on-line and were fully satisfied with the tour and price. You can send them email for information for your tour. We hope you book with them and please say Hello to Gusti for us."

It was my first trip to Bali with my friend, and we booked the tanah lot tour for our first day in Ubud after seeing all the fantastic reviews on TripAdviser. It was definitely a great start to our trip in Bali! Made was our tour guide for the day - he arrived promptly, provided us mineral water & umbrella, making sure we were well taken care of throughout the tour - excellent service! He brought us to the local ubud market on the first stop & explained to us the Balinese culture, their religion, daily life and practices which was tremendously enriching and fascinating to learn. I was particularly intrigued by their Balinese names (they have only 4 names based on their birth order) & their daily offerings.. They count their blessings & give thanks every single day! Next we visited the coffee plantation, where we tried some teas & the famous Cat-poop-cino as said by Made (kopi Luwak) which was interesting..! We went on to visit a temple, rice paddies and tanah lot. The grilled corn at tanah lot is really good! It's been raining the entire day so we didn't get to see the rice paddies due to the fog as well as the sunset at Tanah Lot.. Made felt really apologetic about it but well, he can't control the weather! Despite all, he did make the entire tour an extremely memorable and fun one doing the best he can.. Made is knowledgeable, professional, humorous and passionate - the best tour guide you can ever ask for! By the end of the tour, Made turned into our new found friend :) the best part of the trip is visiting Made's house to really see how the local Balinese live - you don't get this kind of unique experience from any other tour! If you ever visit Bali, this is the tour you won't want to miss! I would highly recommend this tour to everyone, the experience is totally worth it! Just make sure to visit Bali on a dry season to catch the sunset and rice paddies in perfect view. AMAZING & OUTSTANDING TOUR, thank you Made!!"

Further, we were disappointed when our guide dropped us at a \"local\" restaurant filled only with Westerners and an outrageously expensive menu (by Bali standards). This was not the authentic experience we had hoped.However, the trip was redeemed by a trip to the massive Goa Gajah temple, Tegenungan waterfall, a stop at the Monkey forest and tour of a local family compound. In summary, the guide was fantastic and our only complaint is the tour felt like a forced shopping event instead of a cultural experience."

I sent an email off late Sunday, asking for a tour Monday morning and they got back to me nearly immediately and were able to accommodate my quick request. Gus was my driver for the day and I can't say enough good about him. He was funny, polite, answered every question I had and constantly ensured I understood everything he was saying. Should I return to bali, I would book another tour with Gus in a heartbeat."

My tour guide Made Midiarsana has a great command in English which allows easy communication and he showed us the unique Balinese culture and traditions which he upholds. At the end of the tour, a visit to his house was one of the best and special moments I experienced.The focus of the trip was on our experience rather than profit which most of the other private drivers and guides focuses on.Look no further if you wish to experience true Balinese cultures."

Lots of local produce, spices and grains. Next stop was Gunung Kawi Temple. Gusti was prepared with Sarongs for both of us. We had a traditional lunch overlooking a volcano, visited a coffee plantation, another temple, rice terraces and a traditional Balinese home. I can't say enough about how great Gusti was.

He made sure we understood every concept he was explaining and was always answering all of our questions or requests before we could even formulate them.Bali traditional tours was able to accommodate us by substituting one standard activity we had already done by another one of our choice.Gusti speaks a very good English, which allows him to go into great depth when explaining the Balinese culture and its intricacies.During the day, we visited a food market and a primary school. We also visited Gusti's home (which, by the way for those like me who didn't know a lot about the Balinese culture, was a great experience and is nothing like a westerner would expect a home to be), the Tegallalang rice terrasses, the Monkey forest, the mount and Lake Batur and two temples protected by UNESCO. All of this in a nice and clean SUV with air conditioning.Definitely the tour to do if you want to know more about the Balinese culture and spend a great day visiting beautiful places!- Charles & Valerie"

Our first trip was with Gusti who took us on the Bedugul tour, which included a visit to his very own house compound which was really interesting. Having a guide was perfect for us as we got some much interesting information from Gusti, at the same time as being taken round to the key parts of each temple we visited. Our second tour a few days later was the South Bali and Ulu Watu tour which was modified for us, as there is over lap with the Bedugul tour, and we were also able to be combine the tour with a transfer to our next hotel at no extra cost. Ketut was our guide for a second tour, who suggested getting us to Ulu Watu in time for the Balinese dance performance, which was a great recommendation as the show was a highlight of our Bali trip! These tours really enhanced our visit to Bali, it wouldn't have been the same without them. As an additional bonus, both guides were very enthusiastic about taking photos of us as all the key sites on the tour, which meant we have lots of photos of both of us - which is a rarity for holiday photos!

His name was mr Gusti Amun. He made our day, with his cheeky wit and humour, his ability to discuss his culture and his country in English that some people back home in the U.K. would be proud of. It was obvious that he loved his job, describing his traditions with such passion, and with such great entertainment value.

Then it was off to Kintamani, a beautiful drive and then the most stunning view I have seen in my life. After this we went to holy spring water Temple, where we learned about the Hindu religion and the various gods and were then invited to join in prayer, an amazing experience which Nyoman made more special by explaining in great detail and sharing with us. After this we visited a coffee and spice plantation, where we tried a variety of amazing tasting coffee including Luwak coffee (from Wild Luwak) and Nyoman explained all of the spices to us and their different properties. Lastly we drove through the rice fields (amazing scenery) to Nyoman's village. Here we were invited into his house, we met his beautiful family and felt very welcomed into his lovely home.

It was an amazing day thanks to our great guide, Mad\u00e9. He picked us up at our hotel in the morning after which we visited a local market (not that special), he showed us his beautiful house in which he lives with 3 generations of his family and we also popped by a local school where we could check out the classrooms and take photos with the students. Afterwards we stopped by the Royal Temple, a religious center for the locals. Mad\u00e9 gave us great explanations throughout the whole trip regarding the history and religion of the Balinese people, including the description of all the gods, ceremonies, customs. We also visited a coffee plantation where they showed us civets, introduced how the famous coffee, Luwak is prepared and we could also try several kinds of local teas, cocoas and coffees, including the Luwak. Then, we visited the ricefields of Jatiluwih where we also had lunch. Suggest your guide to take the longer path when trekking on the fields, and tell him to drive you through the ricefields themselves, it definitely worth the experience and the view! We also recommend to start your trip later so that you could enjoy the spectacular sunset at Tanah Lot. Go to one of the bars on the hill, order a coconut / beer and just enjoy! Mad\u00e9 was an amazing guide: he was really friendly, funny and had a very good command of English."

We chose to do the Bedugal tour, and our tour guide was the wonderful Made.My wife had not been well for the couple of days previously and Made was very understanding and accommodating, tailoring the trip for us to avoid any major exertion. He was very informative about all of the sights and was more than happy to answer any questions about the attractions and Balinese life in general. At the end of the trip, Made took us to his home which was the best part of the day, seeing how a typical Baliense family lived was fascinating. In addition, his entire compound was built by his father and uncle, including the amazing and intricate hand carved stone temple. Made was a fantastic tour guide, so happy, positive and helpful. I'm not surprised Bali Traditional Tours are #1!"

We had wonderful day on this tour, starting at a very fun and exciting school of kids. We than went to see the market where we were the only foreigners. The temples were magical and rice teraces rather stunning! The volcano is a must see and Balinese house was just so homely and full of family. We love how Balinese live, their philosophy of religion, culture and spirit of every day. We wouldn't have been introduced to that without true knowledgable guide and for that we are ever so greatful! Suk sama ;)"

We booked direct via the website. Very professional throughout including clear and regular confirmation/correspondence, prompt pick-up and the actual trip far exceeded our expectations. Katut was our guide (not full name but I lost his business card!) who was fantastic. He really tailored the trip to what we wanted to see (we did the Temple Tour) and presented the tour with the perfect blend of education and humour. You get bottled water provided and we had entrance fees and some sweets etc from a local market thrown into the price (approx. \u00a340 each)\u2026which is extremely good value for what you get. We would recommend buying some snake skin fruit (Salk) if you go to a market \u2013 very sweet/tasty and very cheap! Also, if you go to a coffee farm it may not be the cheapest but the quality is so much better than elsewhere we found/purchased in Ubud market/shops and still much cheaper than if purchased in UK/Europe etc. We would recommend having a generous tip ready! These guys work hard! Our day was full 12 hours (8am to 8pm) plus approx. 2hrs to/from hotel (Nuca Dua) for our tour guide (Katut)."

I was looking for guided tours because I wanted to know more not only about the usual touristic stuff, but also about the amazing balinese culture and spirituality. Gusti was absolutely the best guide I could ask for. He is super kind and super open to rely to any questions, and gave me amazing insights about the real life of the real people on the Island. The day were perfectly organized and the trip was super comfortable in a new car with AC and a lot of water for the hot days. I cannot recommend enough this tour company! Bali offers many drivers in case you want only to be dropped on and off in places, but having the opportunity to learn so much about the culture is a real treat. Good job Bali traditional Tours!"

Both tours were phenomenal and gave us an insight into Balinese life and some great sights. Seeing his compound and his cute daughter was the highlight. It puts things in perspective of how lucky we are in developed nations. I hope his idea of having a guest house on his property comes to reality because staying with his family would be a treat! The sights we saw were very touristy (which we wanted) but we also saw some less touristy ones. Where we stopped for lunch in Abud was very good and a everyplace was very inexpensive. He knows his history and could answer any question we threw at him. I would highly recommend these guys for a tour and our guide. Hopefully when we return we can stay with him on his compound and see his daughter all grown up! Thank you so much! Sooksema! Amanda and Josh"

Bali traditional tours was exactly what i was looking for and much more!! Nyoman is a great tour guide and provided so much information about bali and the hindu culture. We felt very comfortable asking questions and Nyoman was very happy to answer and educate us. Our tour of Ubud begun with a visit to the market where Nyoman took us into areas where no other tourists were. We spoke to shop keepers and tried some coconut rice cake they eat as a treat. Following this we went to the hidden waterfall which was beautiful and beat my expectations and then on to the Goah Gajah temple where we learnt a lot about Hindu religion and were blessed by a keeper of the temple.Then we had a lovely lunch overlooking the rice fields before continuing on to see a traditional bali home. We were very surprised and humbled when we arrived at Nyoman's house and it was lovely to meet his family and see their way of life. Finally we went of to the monkey forest where we spent a bit of time wondering around all the different areas and feeding the monkey's. We could of continued the tour to a village and a coffee farm but unfortunately we had to head home.It was a fantastic day and well worth the money!Thank you Nyoman!!!"

Taman Ayun Mangwi, Jatiluwih, the coffee stop and the Tanah Lot Temple were all great!

In fact when the opportunity to see a rare ceremony that follows the Hindu calendar arose, the company called us and asked if we were interested in going. They then rearranged our schedule to ensure we saw everything on our agenda and the ceremony. Maday our tour guide was informative, good natured and a pleasure to spend time with. We thoroughly enjoyed our time with this company."

Of course he has a deep knowledge of the islands history and can explain fully what you are seeing and the cultural significance of the places you are visiting. My second visit to Bali and this time I did 3 tours with some customisation including getting to know Seminyak area, buying a sim card and finding a nearby ATM and laundry. Would recommend Bali Traditional Tours to all."

Our guide Gusti was knowledgeable and patiently answered all of our questions.

He was thoroughly good company and we laughed our way through the whole day. So five stars to Gusti and Bali Traditional Tours."

We opted for the Kintamani mountain and tanah lot sunset tour, both of which I would highly recommend!Throughout the tours, Ubud local Ketut was charming, very funny, friendly and extremely knowledgeable about Bali and the attractions we visited. He was also happy to change our schedule so we could visit different places if we wanted to. He also has lots of great stories and anecdotes to share about Balinese village life and all the special customs and traditions which are followed. It was a great experience. We were really pleased to be able to visit his cousin's family compound and to meet members of the family. The company runs a very high quality and personalised spa service too. It would have been great to book a spa session there as we qualified for a discount, but unfortunately we didn't have time. Overall an amazing experience. We loved it and agreed that it was the best thing we did on our holiday. The highlight of our trip. Thanks Ketut and Bali Traditional Tours. "

            "review": "A wonderful cultural experience. I am only just now posting this review having taken a tour back in April 2014 (I wasn't able to select this with the automatic postings for Trip Advisor) I have to say that the day we spent with Nyoman was the highlight of our trip to Bali. We visited a school, coffee plantation, traditional market, two temples and then went back to Nyoman's home where we met his wife, twin children and other family members. The whole day was just wonderful from start to finish. We learnt so much about Balinese culture and Nyoman was so knowledgeable and had a wonderful sense of humour. He was also so patient with me being slow to walk up and down the steps to one of the temples. We enjoyed a fantastic lunch of the best fish I have ever eaten overlooking the Volcano. Whilst this was not included in the price of the tour (we also paid for Nyoman's lunch which was well deserved), everything else was including entrance fees, cold water etc. We actually had a tour a few days earlier organised by the hotel we were staying at and it just didn't compare to our tour with Nyoman. This tour was worth every penny, in fact I would say they are probably undercharging for what you pay. Do yourself a favour and book a tour with BTT - you won't regret it. We are visiting Bali again in September and plan to book another couple of days with BTT."

The museum was very interesting and Made explained everything to us clearly and was very informative. We then headed to the rice terraces at Jatiluwih. We had a little mishap with a flat tyre on the way but it fixed quickly and easily by the garage nearby. The view at Jatiluwih was spectacular. We had a quick lunch and a walk around before heading to Beratan Temple. This was very misty and cool at the time so worth taking a cardi. Beautiful setting although full of local tourist a lovely temple to visit. Then Made was kind enough to take us to his home and show us how a Balianese family lives. Overall one of best trips of our honeymoon and would definitely book again with this tour company if we came back to Bali."

Nyoman was gentlemanly and warm and felt like a close friend by the middle of the day. He shared personal stories that illustrated various aspects of Balinese culture, his own general knowledge of same and the sites we visited, and seemed to be just as excited to get to know us as we were to know him and our surroundings. There was never an ounce of pressure to do anything we did not wish to do, he simply presented options and they were all amazing. We honestly miss him months later despite having known him a matter of hours. We did many great things in Bali, but nothing offered the sweeping immersion into that place like Nyoman's friendly guidance. Could not recommend more highly."

Before I go into details, let me give you a quick summary. Don\u2019t waste your time trying to plan a tour on your own. Bali Traditional Tours are different, fun and unique. They will immerse you into their culture and answer all your questions. In our case, we had Kitut who was a great guide, a safe driver (hard to come by in Bali lol) and also a great photographer!We spent around 8 hours with Kitut. Our day started with a stop at a local market to learn about some Balinese traditions. We then drove to Taman Ayun temple followed by a stop at a local coffee plantation where we got to try more than 12 different teas and coffees and see the fields and learn about the famous Lewak coffee. We then headed to the Jatiluwih rice terrace where we also had lunch. Kitut then took us on a short hike through the rice fields to talk some more about Balinese traditions and farming. We then went to Pura Ulun Danu Bratan temple. Finally we finished the tour at his own house where he showed us how a traditional family build their housing compound and how they live.During the whole trip, we never felt rushed. Kitut was always polite, smiling, and provided answers to all our questions about Bali. When we asked him about pricing and how much we should pay for souvenirs he gave us good estimates that helped us negotiate and bargain with the shop owners. With time, we learnt that his estimates were good and honest and that he was in our favor. The price included all entry fees and water. All my communication with them were through emails and I was satisfied with the experience. They respond fast and well to all inquiries.If you want a unique and different tour, give them a try: You are guaranteed a fun time!P.S. Make sure to book ahead of time. They get very busy. I tried to book another trip at the end of the day and they were fully booked the following 3 days."

A huge factor in which made the trip so memorable were the tours that we booked through Bali Traditional Tours. First off, I was truly impressed by the excellent communication, flexibility, and professionalism of this company through our booking process. We spoke to several other companies and Bali Traditional Tours impressed us so much that we ended up booking 3 full days of tours with them! Let me just tell you that every penny that we spent was well worth it. Incredible value for the price!!! Our first tour was with Ketut for the Kintamani tour. This tour was breathtaking. We were speechless during the tour due to the amazing views that no words can describe. Ketut was incredible. Immediately after meeting him we felt so comfortable and knew we were going to have a great time. He was so engaged, interesting, funny, and his love for Bali is so apparent through his knowledge. This was our favorite tour in terms of sightseeing. Our second tour was with our new friend Ketut again. We started the day with River Rafting. So much fun!!! Will never forget the experience. I would do it again in a heartbeat. After River Rafting we had a nice lunch (included in the Rafting fee) then went on a tour of the Sacred Monkey Forest and the Tegunungan waterfall in Ubud. We truly appreciated how flexible Ketut was in taking us to destinations of our choice and the ability to personalize our tour. What a great day of exercise and my wife and I loved the Sacred Monkey Forest. It was definitely one of our favorite destinations. A monkey actually grabbed the water bottle in my hand and twisted open the cap and drank it. We were laughing all day. Our final tour was the South Bali tour with Made. Such a fun day! Made kept us laughing all day and we truly enjoyed our your with him. This happened to be our final day in Bali and due to this tour - we felt content that we saw much of what the beautiful Bali has to offer. Wonderful tour to visit the sacred temples. Our favorite part of this tour was definitely the Tanah Lot Temple and finishing the day with a magnificent sunset seafood dinner at Jimbaran Bay. Thank you so much Bali Traditional Tours. You made our Honeymoon incredible. We will definitely go on some more tours with your company when we return to Bali. I would HIGHLY recommend this company to anyone that wants to have a wonderful time in Bali."

The traditional Balinese house we visited turned out to be his family house where he introduced me to some family members and he showed me the especial way that houses should be built according to the culture.The tour certainly is not as cheap as others, because I took a tour with another company 2 days before this one, but you can tell the difference between a driver and a real tour guide.

The Gunung Kawi temple and holy water temples were special places and the terraced rice paddies were postcard worthy. There is a lot more included in the tour, the above are just a few of the highlight for me.I did the tour the day after arriving in Bali, which I would recommend, as the information provided during the tour enabled me to understand many of the customs and traditions I saw during my stay in Bali.

Eventhough we are from Malaysia where some customs can be similar, we still learnt a lot and did not get bored despite getting caught in intermittent traffic.Although the fee is a bit on the highside it does include tickets (random fee (?) that needs to be paid on certain roads) so it was worth it. Ketut was also very polite and accomodating to our preferences. Thanks again Ketut!! :)"

This is not our first trip to Bali and we have lived in SE Asia on and off for years, so we are quite capable of exploring on our own. However, after reading the TripAdvisor reviews we could not resist giving these tours a try. What a great experience! Our guide, Nyoman was not only fluent in English - often a loosely used term - he was willing to adjust to our schedule on the fly. We ended up hiring him for three separate days, and visited a wide variety of stunning and fascinating sites - temples, waterfalls, plantations, gardens, schools, markets, private homes - while he shared insights about his country's history, culture, civil systems, and deeply observed religion. Every tour was unique and completely customized. Nyoman is extremely knowledgeable, polite and has an absolutely delightful personality. There is simply no better way to experience the beautiful and captivating island of Bali."

Ketut was awesome and extremely friendly, his depth of local knowledge andCulture was unparalleled and he did his island proud with his great character. We did two days around Ubud with a templeand artistic focus - the Barong dance (which costs 100k extra) was worth every penny. Between the school visit, temples and painting tours to the numerous extras tacked on as situations arose, this was a true highlight of our trip, if you are in Bali these guys (Ketut in particular) are worth every penny - enjoy :-)"

Myself and a friend booked into this tour quite last minute only 2 days previously and were getting email responses instantly with information, times and the itinerary. We had the pleasure of being driven by and spending the day with Nyoman, probably the nicest person we met on our entire trip to Bali. He was very flexible with time and where we wanted to go. The car was very comfortable with air con and in a country of mad drivers Nyoman was safe and sensible yet got us everywhere on time. While he had an array of knowledge of all the places we visited he also advised us of other features on our journey and gave us an understanding of historic Indonesia. At the end of our tour, Nyoman was kind enough to invite us into his family home where we got to see how a typical Indonesian household was run and also met some members of his equally kind and humble family.I honestly couldn't recommend this tour enough, we both felt very comfortable with Nyoman and would definitely want to try another tour with Bali Traditional Tours on our next trip again!"

This was probably my favorite thing that we did in Bali.First of all, we saw a lot of things we never would have gone to on our own. But more importantly, Nyoman was so knowledgeable and interesting to talk to. We learned a great deal more than if we had just made some of these trips ourselves.

When he arrived he made sure we knew what we were doing, where we were going and how well we were all day. When we got into the car he gave us all water and said if there is anything we need to let him know. He came along and carried things for us, made sure of the itinerary etc. We took with us walking shoes, hats and a backpack. The rest was a dream day. The second tour was even more closer to my heart. I like to experience what the people of Bali are doing and all about them. We went to temples and rice fields. We had an amazing lunch and ate with our tour guide which made us very happy. We had a fun very informative and amazing tour and tour guide. We will be using again before we go :)"

Wish we found out about them earlier as they were truly fantastic. We used other guides in the days before (some more expensive, some cheaper), and they were absolutely fine (don't think bad service really exists in Bali), but Bali Traditional Tours definitely provided that added value service and made the day extra special.Nyoman was our guide, and we really clicked with him; such a happy, accommodating and thoughtful person. And super attentive. He took us on a full day tour to see the south Bali temples, which included a stop-off tour of his village and his home on the way. We got to meet his family and see what it's like to live like a Balinese, truly insightful. We learnt so much from him on the day - the tour price includes entrance fees for us but also for him so he can accompany us inside the temples and attractions and introduce us to key features and answer all the questions we had! His attentiveness comes so naturally; always checking to see if we're okay, even running out to get us drinks when he thought we needed some. We highly recommend Nyoman as your guide. We were a little overwhelmed by the choice of other tours and tour companies available - when you walk through town (we stayed in Ubud) there are many shops and stalls offering drivers/guides, so it was difficult for us to make a decision on who to go with. We tried tours advertised in town and via our hotel too. Then finally a quick search on trip advisor led us to these guys - if we were to visit Bali again they will absolutely be our first choice. You can't go wrong with 350+ top reviews right? Right!"

We loved all the restaurants and shopping excursion. We especially enjoyed the suckling pig. Yummy.We have traveled all over the world and this was the best tour company and tour we have ever had.

It really amazes me that 350 reviews later, balitraditional tours is now number 1 in ubud and several hundred people felt the same way as i did.Our meeting this time was really like old friends and as i was travelling with a friend from japan to bali, it was probably the best introduction anyone can get of the real bali. We went up Mt Kitamani and had a mouth dropping view of the mountain and the expansive valley below and all at a humble cafe which served the most incredible indonesian local food. If you are a fan of coffee then you cannot leave bali without trying the local 'cat-poo-cino' otherwise known as kopi luwak or coffee made from the civet cat's poo poo. Nyoman took us to the local farm which cultivates the coffee from wild civet cats, he explained that unlike commercial farms which raise civet cats and feed them coffee beans and collect their poo for coffee, these local farms dont raise civet cats but rather let the animals roam around the coffee plants and they in turn will select the best coffee beans they like to snack on, which means their poo also contains the best coffee. I didnt quite understand the concept of why people will pay over $50 for a cup of kopi luwak until you taste it. So i learnt and got a better appreciation for this most exotic of coffees that morgan freeman told jack nicholson he should try as part of his bucket list.we explored ubud and made impromptu stops to watch a rare inter-village balinese dancing competition, it was noisy, colourful and lively and we really stood out as the only two tourist standing amidst the brightly dressed costumed dancers swaying their fingers and heads in rhythm to the balinese music.as some other reviewers had written, nyoman really loves his job and he may not have the opportunity to travel widely, the next best thing he can do is to bring the world literally into his home, he did that for us and brought us home to visit his entire family including a stop at his mother-in-law's bridal shop. It is worth a visit as you get treated to see how he looked like a royal balinese prince on his wedding day his picture is literally on the shop door.we went to a temple and we participated in a prayer ritual with him and he explained the meaning of purification and the placement of rice on the forehead for blessings.looking back on some of the things other reviewers said about nyoman, i can guarantee that you will be moved by his warm and friendly personality and as the saying goes, you meet as strangers but leave as firm friends. i do periodically read what others say about nyoman and ketut and can vouch that it is all true that they are an asset to bali's tourism sector. I know that everyone who has written on this forum do so without solicitation and their motivation is like mine, we feel a sense of gratitude to their hospitality and the best way to pay it forward is to spread their good work. I do believe that we have to put things in perspective criticism of their tour prices is most unfair, when you consider that you pay only one price for your entire entourage, so whether you are by yourself or with your family, you pay the same flat rate. Just be assured that all other commentors have shared that they eventually felt he deserved to be paid more than he charged, i havent found any other tour guide in bali or elsewhere that was so eager to show you his humble home and meet his extended family and even bring you to the nearby river where the local folks wash themselves.We will meet again and like him i share in his happiness reading every great review he gets."

Gusti was gracious enough to take us to visit his own family compound so we could see the lifestyle of a real Balinese family. We were very honored. The rice fields were picturesque they didn't even look real!! At the coffee plantation we were able to help make coffee and tasted a variety of teas & coffee. The Tirta Empul Holy Water Temple was magnificent to witness in person. We LOVED vising the local school, the kids are so cool!!The tour was all day but we had so much fun along the way it seemed like time flew by.

The day with him could not have been better...his knowledge as a native of the area (his family has lived on the same property for almost two hundred years!), his interest in learning about our lives and culture...his personal touch including taking us to his family compound was truly amazing! He took us to several places that we would never have known about and to any place that we asked him to take us. He was right on time picking us up (in his VERY nice new, clean, comfortable Toyota van) at our rental at 9am...returned us after 7pm that evening...all at the unbelievably low cost of $115 for the five of us. The end of the day at his family compound was truly the highlight. He lives there with 28 family members including his wife, twin four year olds, parents, aunts, uncles and cousins. His in-laws were visiting...and they were all the most welcoming people we met our entire month of touring Southeast Asia. They even made special Bali treats for us to enjoy with tea under their community pavilion in the compound where several of them joined us to talk about the tradition of living together with extended family. To get to see and experience life in his home compound was amazing and get to see what beautiful people they are...was priceless. We felt so bad about what little he charged at the end of the day that we added an extra hundred dollars and some more for him to buy something for the beautiful twins...a boy and a girl....and Nyoman teared up. What a great guy! And what a memorable day. We took similar guided tours in every country we visited while in Southeast Asia...and all were great...but none held a candle to our day with Nyoman.

We have travelled extensively and had been to Bali before; but, the others hadn't, so we had an idea of what would provide a good overview in the day that we had available. The ship tours were in large bus groups and expensive, so we searched the iNet, were impressed by the reports on Bali Traditional Tours, especially the TripAdvisor reports which we use extensively as a benchmark, and made contact.The response was rapid, and with the teams assistance, we agreed a broad program and that we would be met at the port on arrival. This all worked perfectly. Nyoman was waiting for us at the port gates with a clear placard and we set off in his van, which was comfortable for the four of us. Nyoman proved to be an excellent guide and we had a most enjoyable day in which we saw many new items of interest, visited significant sites and, most importantly, were immersed in the culture and lifestyle of typical Balinese people. This included a visit to a typical local market and, more significantly, being taken to Nyoman's extended family home complex and having the lifestyle (domestic arrangements, religious involvement, garden and produce etc etc) explained to us.Nyoman did all of this most professionally, quietly and without drama. His English is excellent and his 'feel' for what we wished to achieve could not have been better. Finally, he is a patient and excellent driver and we had no 'dramas' which, anyone who has driven in SE Asia will recognise as a major bonus.Overall we had a great day, achieved all of our aims and could not recommend Nyoman and Bali Traditional Tours more highly. The record on TripAdvisor attests to this."

So in busy times it may be wise to book in advance. In fact their email was playing up and it was our hotel who helped us get into contact. Although the pricing is in dollars, they take local currency which would have been quite helpful if UK Barclays Bank had not stopped both our debit cards. We had a superb day. In round terms the price was about \u00a350 for 2 (but the same price for 4), but did not include lunch, but that was just over \u00a35 each. For the best part of 9 hours that was great value. As it was a holiday, we started at a local's market not a school. It was fascinating, it was not very clean with mud everywhere, but was open 24 hours per day.Then the normal temples and sites etc. Our guide was superb. His english was excellent and very easy to understand and his knowledge far reaching. We finished at his 'home compound' which gaves us a real insight into how life would have for most people, before the move to cities. Both the cousins were taking tours that day - so try to be flexible on days, we think you will 'feel the difference\" Highly recommended."

We are a family of 4 (children aged 9 and 12) visiting Bali for the first time. We really wanted a tour with a guide who could teach us about traditions, customs and local landmarks. Ketut was always ready with facts and pop quizzes! and was accommodating of our interests (many thanks to the other reviewers on Trip Advisor who pointed us in the right direction). It is difficult to pick a highlight as it was all fantastic! Goa Gahja and the Monkey Forest were the best bits according to our children. Finishing off the day with a visit to Ketut's family compound was great, it was a privilege to be invited in.The tour is a full day with plenty of walking, so wear your walking shoes and bring your camera. Our day started at about 8.30 am and we were back at our villa by 6.30 pm.The cost is a little higher than other tour operators BUT it is worth it (and does include drinks and entry tickets). During the day I noticed people listening in to Ketut's commentary, he really knows his stuff! We would not hesitate to recommend Bali Traditional Tours."

Our guide spoke good English, had a great sense of humour and was constantly volunteering information that gave us a much better understanding of all the things we've seen in Bali. The cost was on the high side, but we thought it was worth it for the quality, having previously been disappointed by cheaper guides. In terms of the tour itself, we most enjoyed the trip to the school and the Gunung Kawi temple. We were underwhelmed by Kintamani village - it's very touristy and full of aggressive sellers. The view it offers of Batur lake and volcano is nice, but perhaps another vantage point can be found away from the chaos? We finished up at the Tegallalang rice terraces, where we had lunch - we ate at a restaurant recommended by our guide. The food was good and genuinely Indonesian, but the restaurant was clearly for tourists only and had several large groups, which didn't make for a great atmosphere. As a suggestion for future tours, perhaps the guide could have a couple of good restaurants up his sleeve to offer different options depending on what the customer feels like. On the whole, we had a great day out and would definitely do another tour with this company if we return to Bali."

It began with a trip to a traditional village and family compound where I was honored to meet my guide's beautiful family and learn about the structure of the family home. Next stop was the traditional village and a trip to Taman Ayun Temple where I learned soooooo much about the Hindu Buddha customs and traditions in Bali and happy to say I have met a new friend. Jatiluwih was incredibly beautiful and definitely a must see. And the final spot was Tanah Lot at sunset. I learned so much about Bali during my short time with my guide and every step of the way Gusti was wonderful at explaining customs, had interesting facts, and small trivia to keep me entertained all day. He spoke beautiful English, was very knowledgable, courteous and very, very funny. I am happy to say I went on this tour. Would book again in a heartbeat."

            "review": "Highlight of our trip to Bali. We booked two day tours with Ketut before we left home. We were not disappointed. It was the highlight of our trip. Ketut really knows his Bali and is so incredibly proud of it. He took us to amazing temples and beautiful locations. He went to a great deal of trouble to explain Balinese Hindu customs and how the temples worked and what all the different places and offerings meant. He really brought the religion to life for us. It was so wonderful to learn about a culture so incredibly different to our own. Everywhere we went, Ketut seemed to know the right place to stop, to take photos, to eat as well as telling us the history of Bali (both recent and ancient) and modern customs and mores. Both days we went to the most amazing places for lunch. I heartily recommend that you take Ketut's recommendation on what to eat. On the first day we were in a beautiful restaurant location overlooking the volcano and lake. Ketut suggested the fish. It was the most beautifully cooked fresh fish I've ever eaten. Melt in your mouth. On the second day we were in another amazing location (overlooking rice paddies) and Ketut recommended the Balinese buffet. Again, we weren't disappointed. It was a chance to try a little of everything. Again, the food was delicious and fresh. The temples we went to were amazing, scenic and beautiful, but you can read about them on other websites. This is all about Ketut and his amazing service. We didn't expect the traffic in Bali to be so horrific. It was great to have Ketut drive us around. He was so funny and full of conversation we didn't notice the traffic jams. His English is impeccable. We had such a good time, we engaged Ketut for a further day. We had booked to have dinner at Mozaic restaurant in Ubud. He collected us from our hotel in Legian, drove us up to Ubud slowly. We stopped on the way at a Batik factory, some silversmith shops and a wood carving factory (all prearranged) we then had some time to walk around Ubud and get a flavour of that town. Ketut kindly took us back to his home so we could get changed into our fancy clothes for dinner and then drove us to the restaurant. After dinner he drove us all the way back home again. It was great. He did all this for us in and around his family commitments and telling us about his commitments in his village for the Balinese festival that was happening, as well as his friend's wedding. It was great to hear all about local Balinese life. Ketut himself is getting married in 2015 and was telling us all about the wedding preparations for his own wedding. We wish him and his bride so much happiness. It is often said that the Balinese people are the friendliest people on earth. This is true and Ketut must be the friendliest Balinese on the island. Everything was perfect, he was punctual, reliable, reassuring, the car was clean and cool, there was bottled water aplenty and for the service, the price was ridiculously reasonable. Would not hesitate to recommend him. When we are next in Bali we will definitely ask Ketut to take us out again. Thatnks Ketut, you are a legend."

We were very well looked after by Nyoman, who is an excellent guide with a very pedagogic way of explaining the ways of balinese life and culture. It is so much more interesting to visit temples and markets when someone can tell you the history and meaning of everything. A big bonus to meet his family in their traditional balinese household. Highly recommended to anyone visiting Bali!"

A long day, excellent value and an experience we will never forget."

We didn't want to do one of their set tours (some things we had seen before and didn't want to revisit, and we were finishing at the airport in the afternoon), so we worked out a plan which included sightseeing and shopping and lunch. Ketut showed us a glimpse of life in Bali, supported by lots of information about religious and cultural factors. He was an excellent guide with a great sense of humour, great knowledge, and great patience (helping to find something I was shopping for in many places). He chose a perfect place for us to have lunch, and he got us to the airport at just the right time to catch our flight. We saw and learned such a lot in one day that we could not have done without Ketut's expertise. Totally recommend this company for Bali tours."

On the second day afternoon, we visited volcano, another coffee plantation for a cup of coffee, rice terrace and Holy Spring temple. Sounds like too many places to visit in 1.5 days but we did it without problems. Everything was smooth and comfortable. We truly enjoyed spending time with Nyoman. He was a great guide the entire time. Very personable, honest and fun. My 9-year-old daughter loved his Balinese children's songs he sang for her. Thanks to Nyoman we had a great time in Ubud. We strongly recommend Nyoman as your guide for your future trip to Ubud. Nobuko"

My time in Bali was short, at the end of a business trip, so I was staying in Kuta in proximity to the airport. VERY glad that I made these arrangements to experience a bit of the real Bali. My tour guide, Gusti, arrived at my hotel a bit later than agreed upon due to a miscommunication in their office. No real problem and appreciated their desire to make this minor oversight right. I had arranged the \"Ubud and Environs\" tour. If I had it to do over again, I would have done a bit more research about exactly what I wanted to see, as the guide was very accommodating of my desires. While we made a brief stop at a batik factory and shop and a wood carving faculty and shop, I would probably have skipped both. There was absolutely no pressure to buy from my guide. We then toured several temples, the rice terraces, and some of the sites of Ubud. Gusti shared a lot of input about the Balinese context and culture in a way that was fascinating and personal. If I had it to do over again, I probably would have lingered just a bit longer in Ubud, as there were a lot of good shops and boutiques here. Really enjoyed the visit to the local vegetable market and the desire of the tour to give a real sense and some understanding of the local way of life. This was, overall, excellent and I would not hesitate to recommend to anyone. Extremely fairly priced as well."

What I actually experienced during those 2 days of tours was truly awesome. The owner of the company Nyoman Grago conducts one on one tours in this company. It is like having a friend that has intimate knowledge of the country, culture, heritage etc. drive you around to learn about the best Bali has to offer. We talked most of the time we traveled together in his very comfortable vehicle about so many topics (many of which I asked about and he was most willing to talk about with great expertise) that I feel I have had a full college course on Bali. Nyoman is a most pleasant person who speaks excellent English and is very easy to talk with. He was flexible to changes in the actual tour that I requested and maximized the value of the tours. I would give him and his company the highest recommendation possible especially if you are tired of tours with groups and being taken to places to \"look at\" articles to buy that you were not aware was part of the tour you signed up for. With Nyoman you can just request what you are interested in and that's what you get---with a great smile."

I won\u2019t even call it a \u201ctour\u201d because he made us feel like family. Before we even arrived, he was so flexible in customizing the tours via to suit our preferences. My husband and I spent two full days touring Bali with Nyoman and it was by far the highlight of our two week trip to Hong Kong and Bali. We have traveled a lot and taken many tours over the years and this was by far the best experience we have ever had on a trip.He was so patient with us and we learned so much about his amazing culture. He was such a gracious host and we even went to his home for coffee the second day and met his beautiful family. Some of our favorite parts of the experience were seeing the Jatiluwih, Sacred Ubud Monkey Forest, Tanah Lot Temple and Tirta Umpul Temple. We also loved the visit to the local school (we brought them some school supplies from home) and they were just adorable and so polite, even practicing their English with us. Nyoman is a truly incredible person and guide and I can\u2019t say enough about him and the wonderful experience these two days were. On top of being a friendly and amazing person, he speaks great English and is incredibly knowledgeable and passionate about both the culture and history of everything we saw. We were truly immersed in the Balinese culture and couldn\u2019t have been happier with our experience. I feel like we have a friend on the other side of the world and hope to travel back to Bali one day!"

He is truly a wonderful guide with so much knowledge about the Balinese culture and the Hindu Celebrations. I would recommend his tours without hesitation, he is such a kind person and is more than happy to explain small details about what you are seeing (even when you ask twice!). The best thing about Nyoman is how passionate he is about his culture and how much he wants to share this with people from other places. I have been to Bali many, many times so tours are not something I am usually interested in but I will certainly take a full day one with him next time."

Everything from picking us up from the airports, tours all day, and showing us local eateries went so smoothly. The service was excellent, the employees were always punctual, they always had genuine smiles on their faces, and you truly get the sense that they wish to show you how beautiful their country is and everything that is has to offer, rather than trying to reach into your pocket and collect as much money as possible. If you plan on using any tour guide services while in Bali, this is hands down the group that you want to use!!! I can't wait to go back and see them again!-Brandon"

We haven't even finished our trip yet and as I am writing from our hotel in Sayan, I felt compelled to write a review to praise such an amazing and humble guide as Nyoman. We have just completed our second tour with Bali Traditional Tours and I must say these two days have been the best so far in our trip, and my feeling is is that it will stay that way.A true guide not only has impeccable knowledge of the culture and the locations visited, but he cares about his clients, who they are and how he can make their experience better. Nyoman does all these things and more. He never rushes you when you want to spend extra time ANYWHERE, and is always willing to customize his tour to suit your interests. If you want to stare at a boring temple for hours on end and that's what makes you happy, so be it. Nyoman will wait with you and try to think of as many stories or jokes to try to make your time more enjoyable. He is the true spirit of a GUIDE. Someone who reminds you of the itinerary, but never forces you to go somewhere just to keep a schedule. Its YOUR time, you can spend it how you want, and Nyoman is always aware of that. Just don't expect him to be able to make all the stops if you spend too much time at one place.After two days of spending time with Nyoman I can honestly say he is not only one of the best guides, but probably one of the best men I have ever met. For full day tours its customary for you to pay for the guides lunch, but Nyoman never expects it or pressures you. He is the epitome of a man with high character and great patience and care. He only expects the agreed upon price and never forces you to buy anything from the locations he stops at. His sole purpose is that you enjoy your time at Bali under his watch, and he is happy to show you his culture and religion that he so deeply respects and cherishes. You can't go wrong with this tour company, and if reading this review has taught you anything, its that Nyoman will show you much more than just landmarks and viewpoints."

If you want to make friends at the school bring some small stuffed animals like we did. You become instant rock stars! This is the best money we spent in Ubud.

We are really glad we chose Bali Traditional Tours' Bedugul tour and had Ketut as our guide. We feel that in this one day, we got to see a little of everything, and we ended the day with a much better understanding of the culture and history of Bali.We visited a traditional market, the Taman Ayun temple, and a spice and fruit farm where we tried luwak coffee! We also trekked around the Tabanan rice terraces (tip: wear shoes with some tread if it looks like it might rain, as the terraces can be a bit slippery!) and ended the tour with a visit to the gorgeous Ulun Danu temple. Throughout all the sites, Ketut did a great job explaining details we would not have learned otherwise. Also, since our hotel was farther away in Nusa Dua, we spent a lot of time in the car. Ketut used the opportunity to teach us about various aspects of Balinese life and culture, and also enthusiastically answered all our random questions that came out of the conversation.All in all, our trip was very well planned.

We visited Tanah Lot, Coffee Luwak Plantation and Uluwatu. But the best part was that we got to see the local market and visit his family to see some real stuff of Bali besides those famous tourism sites. Women in his family were busy preparing the offerings for a celebration of their family temple. I got to learn a little bit of making offerings too. He took us to a local restaurant to taste Babi Guling as we requested which was right next to the rice fields. Food was tasty and at a low price and the view amazing. My husband is also a tour guide in China so they also exchanged their opinions and experiences.Although it was only one day but we sure understood a lot more of Balinese culture during this tour. If I have another vacation to Bali, I would definitely book another tour from him to see more Bali!"

We had a barrage of questions for him, all of which he answered in excellent English (despite it being his 3rd language) and we feel we know so much about Bali now as a result.

If you're inquisitive all your questions will be answered and we now feel we have a greater understanding of Balinese culture, family and religion. There are 3 guides in the business and you will get a different driver based on your language. These guys are a small company of friends so it feels good to support a local startup business. Ketuts English was great and we were able to joke around and have a laugh together.As it was Sunday we didn't visit the school so if that's a priority for you check your days! The traditional market was great to see and Ketut bought us a selection of Balinese fruits to try. All the stops were great and much better for getting explanations then if you just visited alone. My mum became a little unwell from the heat but Ketut was lovely and got her water etc and we slowed the pace to suit her.I will definitely be recommending this tour to friends and family, and trying out some of the other tours next visit to Bali!"

As a result, we concur with all previous reviews about the highest quality skills of Nyoman as a guide, and his company as a business. I recommend the early morning climb to the top of Gungung Batur to see the sunrise and spectacular views.The climb is a challenging walk up a steep path of lava stone and sand, done in the early hours of the morning using flashlights and a secondary mountain guide. This trip was additionally special because Nyoman had never made the summit before and I was very happy to have his company as we drank tea and watched the sun present itself. He was thoughtful enough to have packed a nice boxed breakfast to eat with our tea. Bali Traditional Tours deserves the highest ranking it has achieved on Trip Advisor!"

I cannot explain just how incredible our two days were, I will definitely take another tour if I am lucky enough to go back to Bali. I would tell anyone going to Bali to get the best of your trip, take a day trip (or two) with Bali Traditional Tours!!!!!"

Nyoman is one of the nicest and most humble people I've met and he made the tour enjoyable as well as really informative. Nyoman was right on time at 9 am and he was extremely accommodative since we had a baby with us and didn't want the day to get too exhausting. We had booked the Kintamani tour so we visited The Holy spring temple, Balinese traditional market, coffee and tea plantation, Mount Batur, Telangana rice fields. Nyoman was so sweet that he took us to a halal restaurant on our request. At the end of the tour, he took us to his house compound to show us what a traditional balinese home is like. We also go to meet the family! It was really heartwarming how he treated us so well the entire day. Really glad to we got to experience the balinese culture so closely thanks to this amazing tour. We had such a great and comfortable experience that we requested Nyoman to take us to the Bali safari and Marine park as well.. SInce he was booked for the next day, he got his friend Ngura to take us instead and booked our package for the safari! Talk about being efficient and quick!! :D Nyoman and Ngura, thank you so much! Really looking forward to seeing you again!! :)"

We feel we were given a real insight into the traditions and culture of the Balinese people. The guides loved sharing their knowledge and our highlight was being welcomed on a visit to a traditional home. We will remember this forever. The tours (we took 2) were informative, fun and filled with special touches and knowledge that only a local could provide. Both our guides were polite, fun and above all trustworthy. The places they recommended to eat at during our tours were great. Thank you Nyoman for encouraging us to safely interact with the monkeys at the monkey forest, we were initially a bit apprehensive but all his tips made for a safe, fun time holding and feeding the monkeys. These guys are genuine and passionate about their business and well deserve to hold the number one spot for tours in Ubud."

You get what you give and the friendlessness and laughs were returned in volumes!Be confident that basics like on time, great information, well looked after, good constant attention to detail are simply a given. Even the most annoying and demanding tourists (u know who u are), I bet, would be looked after graciously. If you have a complaint with these guys, look deep, it's most likely your own fault :)We had a few tweaks to the package deal, emailed ahead to advise, but were conscious that deviating unreasonably was just stupid. These are well planned package deals that work for good reason! Yet we were accommodated beautifully. Our driver nicely talked us through how our requests would fit and then we were off!With great humor, good smiles and genuine fun a bigger Balinese world with interesting people was introduced to us :) A fun trick, say \"Hello\" to the touts b4 they get a chance to say \"$1\". You can have some fun and meet the real person behind the seller, for 2 minutes at least lol.After temples and food, lastly we visited a great area for painters and had more good times picking a nice piece we will always remember our day trip by.But that wasn't the end, even though we were at end time, our driver graciously took us to his village, introduced us locally, and we were able to watch (not do) a local village dance practice. Both being from dancing backgrounds chance to watch real choreographers was brilliant and perfect. We are now firm supporter's of panji kumara mas, Duta Gianyar. Good luck for 27th June competition! With reluctance, is was getting late and these guys have long enough days, we were taken 'home'. Even then a night market for some dinner was on our way so we ate with the locals and shared even more laughs.Big hugs and cash signaled the end of a more than fantastic day.Reputation is so very very well deserved I can almost not put it into words."

This is the first time that I booked a tour outside the hotel for no reason at all (it was more like destiny). I was reading reviews from TripAdvisor and found this tour company and another one which I was also considering to book with also with high ratings here. I emailed both companies on the same day and both replied at almost the same time. I picked this company by chance and I thank all the Gods in heaven that it led me to Ketut Mawa, my guide for 3 days in Bali. Ketut was really kind hearted, warm and sincere. He met me at the airport as I arrive from an early flight and went straight on the tours. He remembered the tours I wanted from the email exchange we had and was able to reconstruct the itinerary since some of the places would be repeating. He even went out of his way to find a shop that I was looking for and even called the number I found of the shop from the internet to figure out the way to get there. He also helped me look for something that I wanted to buy and even stopped at the shops to ask for it without me reminding him. And even if I told him that it was ok if we couldn't find one. Ketut happily shared his culture with me and we shared stories all throughout the car rides and tours. We compared our cultures and traditions, shared anecdotes of our own travels and I really felt that I made a lifelong friend here. I have never had a private guide as enthusiastic and as dedicated as Ketut and believe me, I had been on a lot of solo travels. Ketut made me feel that I was more with a friend than with a tour guide. He would even crack jokes along the way.Going through the temples, Ketut would share how their culture and beliefs are, and pointed out things that i wouldn't have really noticed as a tourist. He also told me that we could stop at any shop I wanted to and he even went with me to their local market (not the one where all tourist go). He showed me how and where the locals go to the market and go about their daily lives. Although I was not able to visit a school or their house, we were able to go thru a traditional Balinese compound in a restaurant where we stopped for lunch he explained every detail of the Balinese household and how they live. In one of our tours we went to the Tirta Empul Temple where he said I was very lucky to have seen a traditional ceremony in the temple which even he personally wasn't able to witness with all the years he's been going to the temple. He even went down the water with me and prepared the offerings for the Gods. I really appreciate him going out of his way to prepare everything and even help me find a decent place to get changed. And him coming from Ubud going to my hotel in Seminyak, he really has to wake up early to get there on time and never did I hear any complaints from him. Every reviews said here is true. This company is probably the best you'd ever book with in Bali. When we parted ways after 3 days of amazing tours, i felt like i was leaving a friend. And i promised Ketut that i would surely be back. And right now, I am already planning my next trip to Bali to see what I have missed the last time and I would most definitely book Ketut again as my guide."

We did the Kintamani and Bedugul tours with the addition of the Monkey Forest and highly recommend both of them.Ketut was so welcoming, knowledgeable about the history of all the sights and patient with my parents' limited mobility. He took particular care to assist them when climbing steps became a bit of a struggle. He was extremely caring and thoughtful in tailoring the tours to what my parents would be able to cope with. His happy demeanour was infectious adding so much to our enjoyment and after two days we parted feeling like we had made a lifelong friend.If you are looking for exceptional personalised and informative touring in Bali you will not be sorry choosing Bali Traditional Tours, particularly if you are lucky enough to get Ketut as your guide."

It was a great choice afterall and if you are still searching, just go with this, you won't regret it.Our tour guide is Ketut who showed up on time in our hotel reception. Since we stayed in Nusa Dua area, it was quite some distance to the rice terrace and the temples. During our long rides, Ketut fed us with the Balinese culture, their customs and he spoke really good english! We visited 2 temples and the rice terrace. And on our request, he also stopped by the coffee plantation area for us to try the Luwak coffee, durian and cakes (3 different stops). He walked with us in the rice terrace and even encouraged us to walk deeper into the fields for better view and photos despite the fact that we were lagging behind our schedule. He just asked: \" Do you gals have any appointment tonight? Otherwise, just kept going and don't matter the time, I will be alright!\" He also took great pictures with us. On our way back, we wanted to finish our trip with a nice dinner in Seminyak and he brought us to the dining place! We ended up finishing our tour at around 8pm (2 hours later than our original plan) for which we were really grateful as we did all the amazing things on our trip. I really appreciated Ketut's hospitality and enthusiasm!The price is definitely reasonable and it includes all the entrance fees. And for lunch, we really enjoyed the place with a great view of the rice terrace! It was a really fun day!Thank you Ketut! I wish I would have another time to visit Bali again!I have recommended Ketut to my friend who was also visiting Bali. However, he has been fully booked in advance. so please book early!"

We travelled to Bali with another couple recently, and knowing how easy it is for time to slip away in this idyllic paradise, we decided to book a couple of day trips via the internet before our departure. Of course I turned to TripAdvisor - and the outstanding recommendation that grabbed my attention immediately was the one for Bali Traditional Tours - the best choice we could have made!! This is a small family tour business operated by cousins Ketut and Nyoman, both of whom are truly delightful - enthusiastic, warm and engaging, witty, educated and professional. Honestly, what a find! These boys are the real deal - working hard to do their families proud and genuinely committed to showcasing the region and ensuring visitors have an intimate cultural experience.Ketut was our guide on both of the day tours we arranged. He was completely flexible about itineraries, but we were perfectly happy to follow his suggestions which he adapted as needed. Our visit to a local primary school was a particular highlight \u2013 there was nothing rehearsed about it \u2013 no showy presentation for the benefit of tourists, simply a spontaneous visit to a school en route. Ketut had not been to this particular school before and seemed to have some explaining to do to the Principal before we were shown to a classroom to take part in an English lesson \u2013 a very entertaining and heart-warming experience.Similarly, we were grateful for the hospitality and warm welcome we received from his extended family when we visited his family compound at the end of the day. I\u2019ve been to Bali many times, but this was a special and memorable experience (and the best coffee I had in Bali!). Developing a comfortable rapport with Ketut was effortless - his English is excellent and his sense of humour is wicked! Our day tours with him felt genuinely personal and I\u2019m grateful to him for enriching our understanding of Balinese culture and for sharing with us the intricacies of family life. Highly recommended!"

We were a group of 4 adults and were quite comfortable in his vehicle. He had cold bottles of water for us waiting in the car.. So off to a great start! The tour could not have been with anyone else kinder and he was quite pleasant to be around, incredibly knowledgeable and had a wonderful personality! Nyoman made it clear when we started this was OUR tour; so even though we signed up for the Bedugul tour, we could add on whatever else we wanted. Which we did! After visiting a local market, temples and rice terraces, we asked if he could take us to a place for coffee tasting. Sure enough he came through with a wonderful selection, Yoga Coffee, where we tried the famous kopi luwak...! Nyoman made this trip feel like we were hanging out with a great friend all day. He took us to his favorite place for Babi Guling, which was a non-touristy place on a side street sitting indian style on the ground... Best meal we had in Bali! When it rained, he came prepared with umbrellas and had extra sarongs in case we were cold from the rain or needed to dry off. Best of all, at the end of the tour we visited his home and met his lovely family. Nyoman made this trip unforgettable and we cannot thank him enough! Highly recommend this tour to anyone looking for spending the day with a friend."

Ketut was very accommodating in our constant needs to stop to take photographs. Indeed, this led to our tours taking much longer each day than was planned (and at no extra charge).Unlike so many tour guides who want to take you to shops where they get commission, Ketut never once suggested such stops.Included in the very fair price of the day tours are all entrance fees to the temples and associated parking fees.We will certainly use this small but very reliable company again on our next visit."

I chose the Kitamani and Ubud tours...both full days for $100 AUD each. Well worth it. I booked online and the response was extremely prompt and personalised. Travelling solo, I was made to feel very comfortable. Nyoman (who has the most infectious smile), was my guide, and the service, knowledge and pride he showed were outstanding. Nothing was too much trouble and the tours covered so much of the history and culture of Bali, which is what I was interested in. If you want to see the Real Bali, please consider booking with these 2 cousins,as I am sure you will not regret it. Thanks Nyoman (and the photos of the Elephant ride were great!)"

Not only did we get to see some of the scenic sites of central Bali, but we just felt like we learned so much about the history of Bali, the Indonesian culture, etc. Like anything in life, it's about the people. And Nyoman (and his family) reinforced this belief for me. His innate ability to be so welcoming and warm was what made this experience so great in our eyes. Nyoman allowing us to enter his home and meet his family made me feel very humbled and thankful in ways that I can't fully describe. For anyone visiting Bali, I highly recommend putting aside one day and learning about Nyoman's wonderful country and culture from a true individual who loves his country and culture."

            "review": "Outstanding First class tour with Ketut!. My partner and I did a day tour with Bali Traditional tours with our tour guide, Ketut. I must say it was one of the best, most personalised tours we have ever done.Ketut took us to a local Balinese market, Hindu temple, coffee tasting, a visit to Ulun Danu temple (on lake Bratan) a stroll in a rice paddy, lunch at a little Balinese restaurant/warung and lots of little stops along the way.The service Ketut provided to us was friendly, fun, informative. On our tour Ketut told us history of what we were seeing, shared a few laughs and allowed us to relax in the car when we were tired. He was also kind enough to take photos for us and bring some lovely local sweet crispy treats for our coffee tasting.At the end of our 10 hour tour, Ketut dropped us at our hotel, as we were due to fly out that night to head home. We rushed out of the car, thanked Ketut for showing us an amazing day around Bali. We only had a few minutes to quickly change and head to the airport. As we made our way to the airport transfer car, with our luggage, I realised I had left my wallet on the back seat of Ketut's car. I couldn't believe it. As we were running late we had to make our way to the airport regardless and try and contact Bali Traditional tours to see if we could get it back.To my amazement, Ketut found it and contacted us and was so kind to come all the way back to the airport and give it to me. I was blown away buy Ketut's attitude. He was kind, gracious and smiling the whole time.Over all I would highly, highly recommend anyone to do this tour with Bali traditional tours. A wonderful experience. The next time we are back in Bali we will be taking another tour with Ketut.Thank you again Ketut. Brilliant job.Sampai jumpa."

We were surprised when the guide, Nyoman appeared at the doorstep of our villa instead of waiting for us by the main road as it was quite a walk through the village.Nyoman speaks good English which makes communication much easier and effortless. Throughout the tour, he shared a lot about the Balinese culture and made sure he answered all our questions. He was very professional and engaging in all aspects.The last stop of the tour includes a visit to his house which he shared with 27 other people!!! It was certainly interesting to have a feel of a typical Balinese household. It was definitely a day well spent with Nyoman and we thanked him for the experience."

This was my first time to Bali and I was initially hoping to book a group bus tour, until discovering that this is not really an option in Ubud. I reluctantly booked with Bali Traditional Tours due to the high reviews on TripAdvisor. I arranged everything through email, and received prompt and detailed responses within usually about 12 hours.Our tour guide for the day was Ketut, and he was so professional, friendly and knowledgeable that any nerves I had of the day were quickly gone. Ketut was so easy to talk to, even for a shy person such as myself. His english was very good, and he taught us about EVERY single aspect of the Balinese lifestyle, history and culture. He answered all of our questions and was impossible to stump, and so interesting to listen to. I think this tour company is a little more expensive than others, but it is worth it in every sense. There are also no hidden fees, and we were not charged any overtime fees, even when I requested we stop for dinner. We used one other tour company, that I booked before we left for our vacation. It was advertised as cheaper, but didn't include entrance fees, plus we were charged overtime, so the other tour company ended up being more expensive, and was a far lesser tour. I had wished I booked with Bali traditional tours both days.Ketut made the day very relaxing and simple for us, by paying for all the admission fees and being very clear to us as to where to meet him and what to do. He took us to a lot of places, such as the Balinese household, that I would never think to visit, but now looking back would be disappointed if I had not gone.Bali Traditional Tours is also a family run business, which I really liked too. I would recommend this company again and again!"

From mountain top temple to sea side horseback ride or elephant ride in between, Bali Traditional Tours will more than satisfy you. Excellent English language skills and engaging personalites will make your day thoroughly enjoyable. A range of vehicle sizes can handle small to medium size parties.

We recently experienced A wonderful day tour with Ketut, the day starts with pickup from the hotel at 8am, followed by a visit to a traditional Balinese market, garden temple, school, coffee and fruit plantation, rice terraces, temple on the lake and Ketuts family home. All of the attractions were wonderful and the support, commentary and information given by our guide excellent. At the school we had the opportunity to help students with their English lessons, this was an absolute highlight of the day. The temples we visited were wonderful, the views and walks through the rice terraces breathtaking. The day allowed us to learn so much about Balinese culture and religion and was a definite highlight of our holiday. We were dropped off home at around 6pm, making the day exceptional value for money. I highly recommend this family company."

I'd only add one personal anecdote: our toddler got car sick, and Ketut showed nothing but the most genuine concern and compassion after we stank up his meticulously clean SUV. It was consistent with his sincerity throughout the tour. Of course, he was also very knowledgeable and answered all of our random questions our the sights, Bali, Indonesia history, etc. He also tailored the tour to our request, even adding an additional stop at the Harmony Religious site where Christian, Buddhist, Hindu, and Muslim places of worship stand next to one another on one compound. This is also an independently-run tour by three hard-working, young entrepreneurs, so the very reasonable tour costs go directly to them. Couldn't recommend this more highly!"

That was what we asked ourselves at the beginning of the tour - and now we know: Yes, it is! In one day Ketut gave us Bali in a nutshell, driving us to beautiful rice terraces and temples. What made the tour special was his willingness to explain all the aspects of Balinese life we never would have found out about ourselves. At his own family's home compound he explained about family traditions and offering customs, showing us their own temples as well as the chicken in the backyard. All the way round Ubud he never got tired answering our questions about the Balinese way of life. And at the fruit and spice plantation he made us taste \"Cat-Pooh-ccino\", as they called the beans that have passed the digestive system of a mongoose before being roasted. We had such an interesting and funny day with Ketut that we only can recommend his friendly and perfectly organized service. Thank you, Ketut!"

Immediately upon meeting him, we knew that we were in for two very special days. Nyoman's smile is infectious, his knowledge of Bali's history and culture is very impressive and his love of his country and sharing are to be admired. Most itineraries are fixed in terms of content and timelines but not so with B.T.T. Our days started at 9 a.m. and ended after 7:30 p.m. and during this time our heads were filled with all kinds of wonderful information not restricted to the sites that we visited . Our questions were encouraged. What a fantastic way to have become grounded on our first visit to Bali Please note that the fee he asked for the day is the same regardless of the number of people. What a bargain!. At the end of our first day of touring, Nyoman took us back to his family compound where we met his mother and father, his wife and children as well as some extended family members. We chatted while drinking the coffee and tea we were served and snacked on rice biscuits. My husband is a photographer and Nyoman always sensed when it was time to slow down or stop for a photo. We did not experience this with another driver who took us to the east coast of Bali - NO comparison whatsoever!!!! After our two days with Nyoman we were sad to say good-bye to this lovely, intelligent man with the beautiful smile, big heart. We will miss his wonderful sense of humour but we will cherish the time spent with him, the memories created and the photos taken during our unforgettable trip to Bali."

The famous Tirtha Empul was celebrating it's anniversary last Saturday, the day of our visit! However, it was a special one which falls every three years on the Full Moon and so there were three traditional orchestras, brightly dressed pilgrims each with a different costume of their village and many different animals for sacrifice. What an experience- even Nyomen was excited as he had not seen many parts of this ceremony himself!He is only 25yrs , but has shown great entrepreneurial spirit starting this company with his cousin and does a fantastic job. He deserves all the custom he can get and is very appreciative of Tripadvisor for his clients. I would highly reccommend Bali Traditional tours."

We hired Bali Traditional Tours to take care of our airport transportation as well as show us around the island for a couple of days. Nyoman Grago was absolutely wonderful. He customized the tours to what we wanted.He gave us insight into traditional Bali. He took us to several eating places where the food was excellent and recommended several others near our hotel. Our hotel was also excellent, a recommendation from Nyoman.He took us to famous temples, a volcano, rice fields and terraces, coffee growing, a monkey forest, etc. He explained everything and answered all of our questions. He also pointed out numerous sights along the way. It's obvious he loves what he does, and we loved having him as our guide.We would highly recommend him to anyone visiting Bali.D & G KraemerOntario, Canada"

Nyoman was our very informative, amusing and fun guide. Nyoman's understanding of English was excellent. We were collected from our Sanaur hotel in a clean, air conditioned car, we were given bottled water and set off for Ubud. We visited monkey park where a monkey jumped on my head then down onto my shoulder - banana breath! We then went on to a temple, the volcano where we had lunch with an amazing view, the rice paddy terraces and finally we went to a traditional Balinese home where a family of 28 live together! I would not hesitate to recommend this tour company for any group and would book again if you are fortunate enough to visit Bali again."

It has, but I still had the most fabulous trip and enjoyed it immensely. I\u2019ve never been so sure about \u201cguides\u201d because I like to find things on my own, but if you want to see and experience a great deal of Bali in a short time \u2013 there is no better way.I decided to spend my first day in the Ubud area getting re-acquainted with the area and booked a custom tour with Nyoman. I first asked him to pick me up from the Bukit where I had been surfing for 11 days. He was busy that day so he sent a friend who was incredibly sweet and who took me to all of my requested stops on the way to Ubud \u2013 the elephant temple, some grocery shopping, the RipCurl surf shop to buy gifts, etc \u2026 he was knowledgeable about so many things. Then Nyoman and his brother were my guide and driver for my first day staying in Ubud. We had planned to spend a half day visiting a few areas around Ubud, but ultimately decided to venture a bit further and spent the entire day doing absolutely everything I had hoped to do\u2026 saw a traditional Barong dance in Batabulan village, visited the Tirta Empul Temple (holy water temple), the Satria family coffee/spice plantation in Sri Batu village, went north to Kintamani for lunch and a view of Mt. Batur (which I hiked during my last visit to Bali), visited the silver workshops and shops in Celuk and wood carving workshops in Kemenuh\u2026 I was shocked at how much ground we covered in 1 day and much I enjoyed our conversations about Bali, customs, religions, growth and change\u2026. We ended the day with a visit to Nyoman\u2019s family compound where I met his adorable 2 year-old twins, his wife, and many members of his family. It was such a fabulous day and I\u2019d highly recommend his services to anyone! He had his uncle take me to the airport on my last day and he was incredibly enjoyable as well."

That being said I suggest to book them early as to avoid being sold out. We are sure that Nyoman is an excellent guide, but this is for Ketut.First off, even if you do not know which tour you want to book but you know you want to book this specific company book them regardless. We were able to change our itinerary as we were on the road. Now on to Ketut. If you are lucky enough to book with Ketut please let him bring you to a school. Ketut is originally an english school teacher and his love for the kids and teaching shows when he's front of the classroom. We were able to help in his short lecture by interacting with the children by asking them questions.Throughout the day Ketut kept us entertained with the facts about his country and also learning about how he got to where he is today. He is a fascinating and smart person. The only down side is the Bali traffic. Roads are narrow and it may take some time to get to some of the sites. This in no way is their fault just be prepared to sit in the car and enjoy the scenery."

He was willing and eager to discuss, in depth, any questions we had and answered them all to our complete satisfaction. His driving skills are superb and he built our tour so that we were constantly seeing new things save for the drive to and from Legian where we were staying.The highlight for us was meeting his wonderful family.....his mother, wife and children as well as his cousins. We toured his family compound and were thoroughly impressed with their lifestyle, generosity and friendliness.This was our first time to Bali and we fell in love with it mostly due to Nyoman and his exceptional tour. Prior to booking him I had read the reviews here and was impressed with how highly he was recommended. Now I know that no matter how highly I recommend him it will not be enough."

We visited Pura Tanah Lot and Pura Uluwata; lunching at a small cafe that offered some of the tastiest food that we enjoyed during our trip (also the least expensive).I found this small company through Tripadvisor and booking with Bali Traditional Tours was definitely the smartest decision we made regarding our trip.

So you will get either gentlemen as your guide. Nyoman was our guide. He arrived at our resort 15 minutes before the scheduled pickup to wait for us (while we were having breakfast in the restaurant). We visited all the attractions as planned in the itinerary. All in good time, no rush at all. Perhaps this was also due to us not hanging around too long at each place, with the exception of Uluwatu where we waited for the sunset.Nyoman was very polite, patient and shared a lot about the Bali culture with us throughout the entire day. He was also interested in the way of life in Singapore, where we came from. The trip was pretty much a two-way conversation for the whole day. He was engaging in his explanations, and he also engaged us by asking questions to learn more about culture from Singapore.We requested local cuisine for lunch and he brought us to a small Balinese eatery along the streets known for its beef rendang. It was a place where the locals themselves patronize and not touristy at all, which was what we wanted. Needless to say, it was cheap - about 35,000 IDR for a meal (approx. US$3)!When he knew we wanted to drop by the supermarket at the end of the tour, he offered to wait for us while we did our grocery shopping before bringing us back to our resort, saying that the streets are dark and pavements are narrow so it is dangerous for us to find our way back. It's all goodwill at no extra charge.If we return to Bali, we will definitely contact him again for other tours. I travelled with my wife, and I have to add that we do not look for a luxurious way of travelling. Our expectations will differ from everyone else's, but if you are looking to experience the Balinese culture + countryside + way of life minus the touristy elements, this is the way to go.Nyoman, if you see this, thank you for your time that day. Will never forget the ferocious gnarling monkeys at Uluwatu. =)- Sim & Charlene"

We got in touch with Nyoman just the day before and were lucky he could accommodate us. Being a small family business run by just Nyoman and his cousin, BTT had a very cozy, intimate feel. Even though we stayed in Seminyak, Nyoman, dressed in charming traditional Baliness costume, was able to meet us at the hotel lobby at 10am. His Toyota SUV was really clean and more than comfortable for our family of 3. Nyoman managed to plan a fun-filled day around our interests (Baliness furniture hunting, water temple visit, meals at the famed BBQ pork Ibu Oka and not-to-be-missed Dirty Duck aka Bebek Bengil). Nyoman was very fluent in English. We had no trouble communicating at all. Having a pair of twins at toddler age himself, he was wonderful with our toddler. He brought our toddler to feed the sacred fishes in the water temple, to view the different types of trees in the coffee plantation, to dress him in the traditional wrap dress. Our toddler simply adored Nyoman! With the distance between Seminyak and Ubud and the busy traffic, we ended up returning to our hotel quite a lot later (almost 7pm) and no complaints/extra charge from Nyoman at all! I couldn't recommend Nyoman enough! I would be sure to call Nyoman again in my next visit to Bali."

We worked with Nyoman of Bali Traditional Tours who structured a 4 - 5 days of fun filled tours for us. The highlights for me personally include Tanah Lot, Kecak dance, school visits, white water rafting. I also find the salt farm and the coffee and fruit plantation visits very interesting. Nyoman was very knowledgeable and took great care of us: Took us to currency exchange, planning places for us to eat, provide us with wraps for the temple, etc. He also has a great sense of humour. Thank you Nyoman. We had a memorable time."

We did a couple of tours and I can say that our day with Ketut was, by far, the best out of all of them and probably the best experience we had in Bali. You will not regret taking a tour with this company. Ketut was friendly, polite and knowledgable (and a very good photographer too!!). His car was very comfortable. He was able to give us a lot of information about the attractions that other guides were not. His English is excellent. He was very accommodating and flexible too. There really isnt that much I can say that other reviews haven't covered already! I can only confirm that all the good stuff you read is true!This is the best way to see the real Bali. But make sure you book in advance! I tried to book another tour with Ketut but he was booked out for the rest of our stay!"

            "review": "5 Reasons You Will Love Bali Traditiona Tours. Bali Traditional Tours5 Reasons you will love Bali Traditional Tours:1) Informative: We\u2019ve taken other private tours in different parts of the world and we often left with a sense of the culture and some generic information about the country. However, this tour was totally different. Nyoman, our guide, began to tailor the tour to our interests right away and was by far the most knowledgeable tour guide we have ever had. He asked us some questions to get to know us the first day and realized that we were very into the flora and fauna of Bali. From there during the following tour days we did with him (yes, we liked him so much we spent 5 days with him, adding 2 more days onto our original 3!), he went out of his way to point out every natural element he could find and was nearly an expert on it; from different plants found alongside the road and rice fields, to information about the monkeys and other wildlife of the island. He often noted what also not to touch or to look out for- like poisonous plants, etc\u2026 I had a lot of questions about the culture and history of the island and Nyoman fulfilled my inquisitive mind with bounds of information. It was awesome! 2) Impeccable and punctual. Nyoman was always arrived on or before we expected him and dressed very nicely in the traditional Balinese clothing--- and you\u2019ll know him right away because he has the biggest, brightest smile. 3) Personable: Nyoman has a fantastic personality. He smiles all the time, tells great jokes, and is warm and welcoming. Being a tour guide never appears like a \u201cjob\u201d to him. He seems to love what he does and loves working with people.\u2014it really shows!4) A great reference: Every time and I really do mean EVERY SINGLE TIME Nyoman referred us to something, it was awesome. He referred us to some restaurants both during the tour and for other days when we weren\u2019t with him and wouldn\u2019t you know, it was the best food we ate--- possibly ever! When we explored by ourselves some restaurants based on internet reviews, they may have been good, but they weren\u2019t as good as Nyoman\u2019s referrals. If he says that he thinks you might like something, you better try it, because it will be phenomenal! Note: These are not places that he refers for kickbacks either, because often we went to these places without Nyoman, so this is a genuine referral. He also referred us to activities and sights and was just as spot on with meeting our interests and needs. He knows what\u2019s good and what you will like and he does a great job of referring you to it. 5) Not just a tour guide, a friend: At the end of our 5 tour days with Nyoman we really felt a connection to the island and to him. He made us feel a part of Bali in no way we had ever experienced on a tour before. He brought us to meet his family, which are the most wonderful people you will ever meet, and he also went with us into the water temple and navigated us through a traditional Hindu/Balinese prayer and even took me to see a traditional Balinese medicine man--- something most tourist don\u2019t do. We were the only tourists often in some areas and we felt totally comfortable in our place because we had a wonderful guide constantly leading us through the unfamiliar territory and making us feel welcomed. I hope to travel back to Bali one day soon. And if I do, Nyoman will be the first person I call."

Although he is so highly rated in trip advisor, our experience was even better than we expected. Nyoman is very knowledgeable about the history and culture of Bali. Furthermore he provided excellent restaurant recommendations that delivered the experiences that we requested. Nyoman is reliable, flexible, friendly, personable and genuinely cares about providing great services. I had contacted Nyoman to book my trip in Feb and I liked their service instantly as they responded very quickly. From that point on, everything was handled perfectly and there were no hassles. Also the tour price was very resonable.I have travelled to many countries and taken many tours. I would give Nyoman and Bali Traditional Tours my highest recommendations."

            "review": "A wonderful cultural tour of the heart of Bali - Ubud and beyond. Our tour with Ketut took place on our first full day in Bali, and it provided the perfect introduction to Balinese culture. From the moment we met him, Ketut was gracious, knowledgeable, amusing, and flexible. We had requested a couple of changes to the Kintamani tour, and he helped us create a perfect day that accommodated specific interests of everyone in our family of four (parents and daughters aged 21 and 23.) and minimized long stretches of time in the car. We learned so much about Balinese history, culture, religious traditions and family life, and each place we visited was special in its own way including the coffee and spice plantation, the Tirta Empul Holy Water temple, and the rice terraces of Tegallanang. When we headed up to Mount Batur, it had started to rain and we were concerned that our only views would be of clouds. But, by the time we had finished lunch at the top of the mountain, the clouds cleared to reveal magical views of the mountain, evidence of past volcanic eruptions, and the lake in the distance. Bali's roads can be crowded and chaotic, with motorbikes everywhere and a very loose definition of what consistututes a \"lane\". Ketut's driving was so assured and smooth that none of us were carsick or nervous, and he graciously answered all my many questions as we drove from one destination to another, and spent considerable time at each of the sights explaining everything we were seeing. I agree with the other comments on Trip Advisor that Ketut's obvious pride in his country and its very special culture make him an ideal guide. We never felt rushed, and yet we saw so much in a single day. We were so pleased with Ketut's services that we hired him for a second partial day, and he drove us from Ubud down to our villa in Sanur, and stopped along the way so that we could see batik being made at Batubalan. Ketut will handle the entrance fees to the various sites and they are built into the daily charges. Before you go, be sure to read up on how to bargain. You will visit a few places where there are things for sale, (e.g., Mas for wood carvings) but don't feel pressured to buy, and don't expect Ketut to help you negotiate, as he wisely stays out of the bargaining process. All in all, it was a wonderful experience, a great value, and we would not hesitate to recommend Ketut and Bali Traditional Tours."

I have travelled to Bali a number of times and been on a significant number of tours over the past 20 years. Without doubt, this tour (Tanah Lot and Rice Terrace) was the best I have been on. Ketut was a lovely guide, taking great pride in his business and his country. He spent the entire day with us, explaining the culture and significance of each site. His recommendation for lunch was fantastic - a lovely local restaurant high in the hills surrounded by the rice terraces of Jatiluwih. If you are heading to Bali I would recommend that you get on to this company and book them for any tours that you wish to undertake - or design your own - they will be more than happy to oblige."

Our decision to explore Bali with Bali Traditional Tours was based on the excellent wrap given in the tripadviser by those who had previously toured with them and we fully endorse their comments. We initially booked 3 tours, but ended up doing our 4th tour with them, as well as got them to drops us at the airport on the 5th day.  Pre-tour communication and booking arrangements with Bali Traditional Tours was simple, straightforward with no hidden costs and their response time was very quick.  Ketut, our tour guide was a very pleasant, punctual, and a knowledgeable young man full of enthusiasm, had a good understanding on customer service. He well understood my expectations being an armature photographer who liked to experience the REAL Bali, Balinese culture, people and customs and he customized our tour to meet my needs. We were impressed with his knowledge on history, and traditions in Bali and also on Hindu epics i.e. \u2018Ramayanaya\u2019 , Mahabharata and explained them to us in in simple English. Apart from the usual tourist attractions, he took us to markets, shops, restaurants where locals go and introduced us local food, fruits, sweets and drinks. Wow it was a fantastic experience! Also Ketut helped us bargaining and acted as our interpreter with the locals but at no occasion tried to promote us buying into anything. He was a very careful driver and never took chances on the road. We also admired his patience specially when we were taking too long at certain picturesque places taking photographs, and he soon became my assistant in carrying my camera gear, and helping me change lenses, and guiding me to the best vintage points for photography. He was very concerned about our belongings and made sure we do not leave anything behind. We were invited to visit his residence compound which was a great experience to witness a typical Balinese life style. We also witnessed the behind the scene activities where preparations were done in the temple ceremonies, met lots of people, took lots of colorful photographs, even tasted some food being prepared for offerings which was an opportunity no ordinary tourist would enjoy. We missed out visiting a school due to the school examination time, but will experience that in our next visit to Bali.I would confidently recommend Bali Traditional Tours and Ketut to anyone who wants to see REAL Bali!"

He arrived early on the day of the tour to pick us up. We chose to do the South Bali and Ulu Watu tour and we thoroughly enjoyed it.Our first stop was to visit a traditional Balinese family compound to see how the Balinese live. This was so interesting to see, and it was touching to meet Nyoman's family - including his parents and twin sons. We truly felt welcomed into their home. After this we visited the Royal Temple of Taman Ayun. It was stunningly beautiful - the gardens, the lake, the temples. After this we visited a spice and coffee plantation where we sampled a variety of teas and coffees, and Nyoman explained the process of making Luwak coffee. From there we enjoyed a stunning drive through some of the most stunning scenery to see Tanah Lot. It was a real highlight to see this temple perched on the rock with the gorgeous Indian Ocean surrounding it. After a quick and delicious lunch stop, we headed to our last stop, the Ulu Watu Temple.After our day with Nyoman we really felt that we had seen and learned so much. Nyoman was accommodating to our every need and a wealth of knowledge. But what truly made this tour exceptional was Nyoman himself - he is friendly, funny, genuine - just a truly wonderful soul. You must do a tour with Bali Traditional Tours if you are fortunate enough to visit this country. I cannot wait to return to Bali and spend another day with our new friend seeing more of this beautiful island."

Nyoman's a great tour guide- he has good food recommendations, he is so familiar with driving around Bali and knows most of the popular places to go to, and he tells you so much about the interesting cultures of Bali. Even though the distance between the places that we wanted to visit were far, he would try his best to plan your day for you such that you can visit all the places. I have to say that I was truly impressed with his service as he remembered that I had nose allergies when he heard me sniffing in the car. My previous tour with him was almost a year ago!! Thank you Nyoman!! :)During our long journeys, Nyoman was also a great person to chat with and my bf and I could talk about anything and everything with him.

On the South Bali tour, we visited the rice terraces of Jatiluwih and the famous temple at Tanah Lot. But the absolute highlight was our stop at a local school, where Nyoman introduced us to a class of lovely, enthusiastic children who were full of questions about our culture. Do not miss this charming segment of the tour; it really made our day! Our guide, Nyoman, is a wonderful ambasssador for his culture, customs and country and we greatly enjoyed sharing our time with him."

Although we had chosen a specific tour he was willing to take us to any location we desired. We toured the artisan villages where specific areas determine what you will see. There was textiles, silver, wood carving and temple designs. It was definitely a highlight to see the talents of the people. We stopped in Ubud for lunch at the Melting Wok and had delicious curry with coconut milk. We visited amazing temples and our driver gave us a history on the hindu beliefs and cultures. Driving through the rice paddies and villages was a beautiful contrast to the beach view we also had. I definitely suggest adding a tour to your visit especially if you're only there for a short time like we were. Overall, I loved Bali and will definitely go back for an extended stay...and probably set up a crate to send back beautiful hand-made furniture!"

Nothing is too much bother, everything is explained so well. Really flexible with your day and always asking if you wish to stop, have something to eat, is the air con ok etc etc. Such a caring and devoted guide I have never come across in 12 countries. So progressional. Don't be talked into going with a cheaper or different company by your hotel or the locals, this is one tour company you don't want to miss out on. Will be using again when in Bali next. They also offer airport transfers or just to be your driver for anytime you wish. Couldn't be happier, they deserve their high rating:)"

I couldn't recommend him any higher. When we go back to bali and take our children we will most definitely be booking with and going see Nyoman at bali traditional tours once again.

When in Bali for the 1st time, one is torn between relaxing by the breathtaking scenery & jus soaking in the sun, sea and many spa facilities available. However, please start your visit with at least a day spent with Ketut. Being very familiar with trip advisor, as a tour guide myself (for 26yrs!) I have a great desire to know a country on a deeper level. Ketut is a wonderful ambassador of his country. Sincere (I needed to request to be taken shopping) & knowledgeable with a great sense of pride for his culture & religion. He makes every effort to help you understand the spirit of the Balinese, explaining every detail with passion & a touch of lighthearted humour. I couldn't have asked for a better guide to show me the real beauty of Bali. Thank you Ketut, we will be back for sure. Carol and Sher Min"

Nyoman picked us up in our hotel in Seminyak and we had a wonderful day with him! Not only did we learn a lot about the culture of the Balinese, the Hindu gods, the way of living etc. but we also visited many iconic and many traditional sites! It was a real pleasure to visit touristic highlights like the Ubud Monkey Forest and the Holy Spring Temple with Nyoman, who could tell us everything about the locations, meanings and history - this really makes the difference! But what is really the highlight of the tour is the not-so-touristic elements: the visit of the traditional village, a Balinese restaurant and a fruit and coffee plantation where we were the only guests. Apart from this Nyoman is a really nice guy, who drives very safely (which is unique in Bali!), is always willing to stop during the trip to explain things and who really enjoys telling you about himself and the Balinese culture. Very highly recommended, if we return to Bali we'd definitely book a tour with Bali Traditional Tours again!"

I booked the tour a couple of months in advance since we were leaving on a 44 day trip, most of it on a Regent Seven Seas cruise, ending with 3 days in Bali. It may have been my favorite day of the entire trip! We spent the day with Nyoman who took us to a locall market (where we got to try some unusual fruits), the volcano, a traditional restaurant, a spice/coffee plantation, a temple, AND his family compound. We learned so much about the traditional Bali life! Nyoman is well informed, enthusiastic, and open. He speaks excellent English and is a great driver;-) He listens to clients and responds to their interests - and he's interested in hearing about your culture as well. You won't go wrong in spending a day or two with Bali Traditional Tours. It's a great little company that deserves to succeed!"

He wanted to show them that they should work hard and learn to speak English to communicate with the rest of the world. I cannot recommend Bali Traditional Tours enough.

Nyoman Grago is a cut above the rest - he is honest , sincere and focuses on doing his job well and is well deserving of all the accolades accorded to him by the previous reviewers. We had a day with him to see the East of Bali. He got on effortlessly with all the members of ours group ranging from 3years to 70years.He graciously invited us into his village home and the kids were thrilled at being able to see chickens,pigs and rabbits in the compound in stark contrast to our small high rise living abode back home.His beautiful wife and family welcomed us whilst he explained the structure of the compound to us. We noticed that the best room in the house was reserved for guests-my husband later commented that they were very \"hao ke\" .which translates to them being very hospitable as the best is kept for the guests.The ladies in his extended family were great at making balinese leaf offerings-they make about 50 per day to use around the house.We proceeded to see the Bat Cave Temple In East Bali and enjoyed seeing the traditional way where sea salt is harvested from the ocean.Unfortunately, this appears to be a dying trade as it is not very viable and there are only 2 families left in the East Coast still invested in the trade.We subsequently visited a Orang Bali Asli traditional village whereby it is the traditional for the village folks to marry within the village. He told me that a distant aunt from his own village broke that traditional by marrying in, and so his uncle in law had to pay a \"fine\" to the village.Bali traditional tours would not be the same without NYOMAN GRAGO. It is his personality that infuses a WOW factor into the tour.We wish both him and his family the best in health and business and hopes that he stays as charming as we remember him.RegardsAudrey and family"

We were never hurried, and he gave freely of his time if there were additional things of interest to explore. Everything was explained well, and we came away feeling that we now know so much about the history, culture, traditions and life of the Balinese people. Yes, we could possibly have got some other local to take us around for the day a bit cheaper, but we felt we had had excellent value-for-money, and we had been given experiences we most likely would have missed out on with any other tour operator. We were especially interested in visiting a local primary school, where we had an almost overwhelming welcome from the enthusiastic children.

I found him from Tripadvisor and as I see that his 'Bali Traditional Tours' website is more well presented than the others, I felt inclined to use his service . I traveled with my energetic 14 years old son and we booked river rafting on August 4, Bali Safari and Marine Park on August 5 and two custom tours on August 6 and 7. I emailed Nyoman one week ahead and got a prompt answer which confirmed all the tours with details the next night. On our way to river rafting, Nyoman briefed us on Bali's culture and religion and pointed out interesting places to us. He brought us to Mega Rafting and there we met a very nice coach, Wayan. It was an exciting but not dangerous experience and there were hot shower and a big plate of food awaiting for us at the end.  We love the Bali Safari as we had the chance of hugging an orangutan, touching a baby lion and riding an elephant (Nyoman helped us to book the elephant riding). The Bali Agung Theater Show in the Safari was highly recommended by Nyoman and we found that it was a really entertaining show with professional dancers and musicians and many lovely animals. This show is a lot better than the Devdan show in Bali Nusa Dua Theatre which we found overpriced (at US$65 to US$120 per adult) and mediocre. Please remember that the show is only included in packages (starting from jungle hopper package which is only US$49 per adult). The custom tours are (1)Ubud Artisan Villages -- Sacred Monkey Forest -- Uluwatu Temple and (2)Pura Ulun Duna Temple -- rice terraces of Tegallalang -- Tanah Lot Temple.  Nyoman paid all the entrance fees and he even bought us banana to feed the monkeys. As my son and I were not interested in the coarse batik sold in the tourist market but found his sarong better looking, he brought us to this very little local shop where I got a real bargain for some beautiful woven sarongs. He also helped us to book the Bebel Bengil Dirty Duck Restaurant in which you can sit on a raised platform overlooking the rice paddle the Balinese way. Remember to ask Nyoman to reserve the smoked duck (one day advance booking) if you want to try something in addition to the crispy duck. In the Pura Ulun Duna Temple, he was so excited about the good weather as he had never encountered such a sunny day there. We finally came to the conclusion that we benefited from a good date in the Balinese calendar. In the rice terraces, he explained to my city kid the unique irrigation system used and showed him the plow carried by the ox. He found lemongrass on the road and crashed the grass to let my son to smell the aroma. Nyoman made us understand how Balinese love their religion, culture and living.  Thanks Nyoman!"

My wife has a thing for food stalls(spicy corn griilled and mangosteen) Grago was kind enough to drive around looking for these things and when he saw them along the way he stopped, helped us get a good local price, and made it possible for us enjoy our local delicacy which was off the tourist trail. The stop to try coffee luwat was also a pleaser, I however regret not getting an entire bag of coffee ginseng from the place we visited. I ended up getting the one at the airport which as lame. All in all I highly recommend this tour, a down to earth guide, very friendly and personable, easy to talk life with as well as Bali culture, but it's the little things that count. These are things that make this tour different. I wish there was a Grago guide in every country I visited."

He never becomes frustrated, he drives safely and he has a good sense of humour which is important. Also, as I was travelling with another female, it is worth noting that Ketut is in no way inappropriate or sleazy and doesnt make anyone uncomfortable (as can sometimes be the case with some drivers in Bali.Highly recommend this company - it may seem a little costly at first but it is worth it for the service (also includes water, entry fees and travel in a nice clean cool van)."

Bali Traditional tours organised for us 2 cars traveling together in Bali's different locations, well sinchronysed. Reviews are very accurate, You won't be disappointed! We did the temples (with kecak dance), the rice fields (with visit to caffee and fruit plantations) and volcano. The visit to the tradicional balinese house was the cherry on top. All worth it! Price is more than convenient."

My husband and I took a modified version of the Kintamani and could not have been more delighted with the service we received from Ketut and the sights along the way. He even had spare sarongs for both men and women which you can borrow before you enter the temples. We made an early morning stop at the Besakih (mother temple). You need to take a local guide in there. Worth seeing if you can get past the constant parting with your money while you're in there. Ketut was almost ashamed of this when we told him just because it reflected badly on Bali. We were not sorry we saw it though. It is a small family business that is run professionally and deserves every good word it gets. Enjoy the beautiful Bali..."

If you're visiting Bali and are interested in more than just a beach holiday, book a session with Bali Traditional Tours. You won't be disappointed!We had an amazing experience travelling with our guide Nyoman to various spots around Bali. He's such a wonderful host, warm person and able to provide you with loads of interesting facts of the sites you'll be visiting.Let me set the scene for you. We were able to build our own itinerary (or you can choose one of the packages), we were picked up from our hotel and it was just the two of us with our guide Nyoman. How's that for the personal-touch?!Our itinerary:- We started the day going to the traditional market where we bought some nice snacks with the bargaining help provided by Nyoman- Next we visited the Gunung Kawi Temple. Nyoman told us so many interesting details about the many religious traditions and the history behind the site. It gave us a much better understanding and appreciation of the uniqueness of this site- We proceeded on to Kintamani volcano, where Nyoman drove us to a perfect spot to take pictures and hardly any tourists go- The coffee and fruit plantation offered a nice little break in the itinerary and a great chance to taste some amazing coffee flavours- Tirta Empul Holy Water Temple is one of the most important Balinese Hindu sites and an opportunity to see and experience some unique religious rituals. Having a guide there, makes the experience so much more fruitful- Next Nyoman took us to his rice field (yes, he's also a rice farmer!) and to his family compound. This was probably the highlight of the day, where we were graciously offered a glimpse of traditional Balinese life and got the opportunity to meet his beautiful wife and twin children.There is no doubt in my mind that the guided tour is worth ever penny. You get so much more out of visiting the various sites by having someone like Nyoman explaining to you the not-so-well-known facts and explaining the many traditions and rituals.Thank you Nyoman for your warm hospitality and showing us so much! You have a rare gift. Best wishes to you, your wife, Galih and Galuh."

It was just myself and my 9 year old traveling and she was very keen on going to Ubud to see the monkey sanctuary. Firstly we booked the tour from home and could not believe how quickly and efficiently everything was organized. Nyoman picked us up from our hotel in a nice, clean, airconditioned car. His English is very good, he is genuinely friendly, flexible and professional. He didn't mind me asking all sorts of questions and he was very knowledgeable. He made us feel very welcome and comfortable straight away. I wished we had more time so that we could have explored more of Bali under his guidance. Will definitely book again with Nyoman if I ever go back to Bali!Nyoman, you are lovely and we wish you and your family all the best from Helga and Laura."

Nyoman was professional as both a guide and driver and provided many insights into Balinese culture.

This was our first trip to Bali, and Nyoman's tour (of East Bali) was among one of several tours we took while visiting. By far, this one was the best (when you accidentally book one with an inferior company, you will know the difference)! Nyoman spoke excellent English, and was extremely knowledgeable about the history and each destination. Driving around for several hours, we had a wonderful time getting to know each other, asking questions, and sharing laughs. Nyoman truly has a gift for speaking to people: he made us feel welcome, like old friends. We saw many sights and stopped to take pictures of the beautiful countryside. The nice thing about Nyoman--another contrast with other less enthusiastic guides--is that he is willing to improvise and slow down to sort of \"zoom in\" and behold a special village gathering, view, or sunset. Although we did not get a chance to visit the traditional school that was listed on the itinerary, his meticulous guidance through all of the other sites, he attentiveness, and his warm persona made up for it. If we could plan our vacation again, we would have cancelled our other tours and stuck with Bali traditional tours for a few days. My husband and I recommend this trip to ALL visitors--new and returning--as the tours are packed with so much information and all around a wonderful experience. Thank you, Nyoman, for making our vacation such a wonderful adventure!"

We went to a tradional wedding (amazing), 2 cock fights (interesting), an orphanage (very humbling) & so, so much more. Ketut was hilarious, after five days with him - I actually cried after he left.

All of the previous reviews couldn't be more spot on in terms of the wonderful service provided by Nyoman and his cousin.We were lucky to have Nyoman, who speaks excellent English show us around Bali. He was courteous, polite, funny, and a very safe driver (especially in the crowded streets of Bali). We had a fantastic time on the Bengul Tour where we visited several temples, rice fields, and drove through the beautiful Bali countryside. Nyoman recommended this little restaurant overlooking the rice fields of Jatiluwih, and it was one of the best lunches we've had! It was a treat to have him join us for lunch, as he was so grateful to us for that, further proving how the Balinese are the nicest people we have encountered on our travels. Nyoman was very knowledgable about Balinese history and culture, and answered all of our questions. This tour was the highlight of our short stay in Bali! Honestly, we still talk about the tour even after returning, and Nyoman is such a good ambassador for Bali that we can't wait to return again so we could take his other tours. Do not hesistate to book with them, as the booking process was very easy and you pay after the tour - so no need to go through Paypal or having to give your credit card information online."

The car was clean, he provided water and found out what meals we would prefer so could pick the right restaurant for us to have lunch at.

He was also a great driver and considering we traveled all over the countryside, I can see how many would get lost. He tailored the day to what we wanted and even stopped on the sides of roads to see things and explain what was happening. We loved it so much we booked another tour with him and it was just as good as the first.

Sat by the pool on the Tuesday at our first hotel I decided to email Bail Traditional tours to see if it was possible to book a tour for Thursday. I received a reply back very quickly confirming that Ketut would pick us up from our 2nd hotel at 9am. Ketut was on time arriving in a very neat clean little SUV. The service was excellent, Ketut's english, knowledge and love of his country was so obvious. Not only did we see the regular tourist spots but we also had an insight into the Balinese way of life, the culture and religion it was a totally wonderful experience and one that I would recommend to anyone visiting Bali who wants to learn more about the Balinese culture. Please also refer to Ruben & Adriana's comments because I could not of put the experience any better than the way they describe, there are many points that I remember from this tour that I still refer to when speaking to people back in Australia about. my experience Thank you Ketut, we hope you like the photo and hope to be back again soon."

Ketut is extremily polite, intelligent, knows every aspect of balinese history , culture an society aspects with a special interest.This is the kind of person who makes you feell emotion for the love he has for his country. He is one of them. You will never feel you are been shown a place by a touristic point of view. Of course you will visit all touristic sites, but the difference from a regular tour is made by himself. The cultural background of this university student is an open book. I can't remember I have learned so much from any 3 days tours during my entire life. And I travel a lot.When my plane left Bali, I had the impression that all my beliefs and knowledge, even the most solid ones have been changed forever for what I could see, for what I could learn. And Ketut was responsible for that mind change I and my wife had forever.I don't know if I will have the opportinty of visiting Bali again, since I live thousands of kms away, but I would like to thank you ketut for the \" bali book\" he has read with us.Thank you and all the gods bless you.Rubens and Adriana"

Nyoman drives safely, is very polite, personable and consults with us as to what we want to do and see. He did not bring us to tourist traps which is quite refreshing. We had a grand time with him trying out babi guling on roadside warung a few minutes from the Tanah Lot temple and at dinner, we treated him to Bebek Bengil (Dirty Duck Diner) where we ordered the ever famous crispy duck, baby back ribs, and sambal fish in banana leaf. He was quite happy to finally try out the ever popular restaurant for the first time. He shared some more stories of Balinese culture including the medicine man and his incredible experience with one of them. We told him that the next time we visit, we'd like him to accompany us to the medicine man. For all his hard work and effortless guiding, he definitely deserves a fat tip."

This was our first trip to Bali, Nusa Dua with our 7 yr old twins and I am so glad we booked a tour with Nyoman at Bali Traditional Tours. Our pick was the full day \"Tanah Lot & Rice Terrace Tour\" and we opted for the late departure time at 10am as we wanted to catch and photograph the beautiful sunset at Tanah Lot. After a 90 mins drive our first stop was Taman Ayun Temple, followed by an amazing scenic drive through the rice fields of Jati Luwih. Nyoman picked a perfect little restaurant, called \"Wr DHEA where we had a wonderful lunch of Mie Goreng, Orange Chicken, Sate Ayam, Ayam Betatu, Bubur Injin and several drinks. The whole affair cost IDR 370000, about 40USD. Their rice pudding with coconut milk is a must! It was truly delicious. After lunch we headed down the hill passing the rice fields one more time towards the main attraction of the day, Sunset at Tanah Lot on the west coast. We decided to make a quick stop at a coffee and cocoa plantation along the way that we have passed by earlier that morning. Unfortunately we got there just a few minutes before 5pm and thus we missed the demonstration of how to roast coffee beans in the most traditional way. Even though the guides were not there anymore, Nyoman was still able to lead us around pointing out the most interesting things to see and arranged for a quick coffee and tea tasting. Our favorite flavors were the Lemon Tea, Ginger Tea and the Mocha. \"Luckily\" the gift shop was still open and we picked up a few pre-mixed packets of these delicious teas and coffees. (should you miss this stop, don't worry you'll be able to find these and other flavors at the airport shops in the transit area - and even a bit cheaper, too)From the coffee plantation to Tanah Lot, with very heavy traffic, it took us a full hour to get there, but we finally made it around 6.30pm just as the sun was setting over the horizon. If you'd like to walk on the beach and see the Temple up close, you might want to get there at least an hour earlier. It's also a bit of a walk from the parking lot.It was a great day with a great tour guide and lots of interesting, new information on the Balinese culture and amazing sites. We'd definitely recommend Nyoman and his cousin Ketut to our fellow travelers and we'll surely be back to Bali in a hope to discover more amazing parts of the Island with Bali Treaditional Tours.All the best to you, Nyoman and warm greetings from Singapore. See you soon!"

This being our second time back in lovely Ubud (the first being in late 2010), it was a no-brainer that we should engage Nyoman again to guide us through the various places in Bali. Our first trip had been too short to do much (though he had obligingly brought us to various places such as Uluwatu in a short half-day trip that lasted till late in the evening), so we decided to stay longer for this trip and then take up a full two-day tour of the various temples and local attractions in and around Bali.Nyoman was his usual cheerful self during our excursions to Gunung Kawi temple, Kintamani with its beautiful view of Mt Agung, Taman Ayun temple, a coffee and tea plantation and other places like Puru Ulun Danu temple. He even obligingly brought us to the Monkey Forest in Ubud to round off the second day even though it was late, and he had family waiting for him at home.I'll fondly remember the fields of Jatiluwih, the wonderful Ayam Betutu at Warung Rhea (he's spot-on when it comes to food recommendations!) and the quaint little village of Petulu where the white herons congregate only on certain trees (you have to see it to believe it!). I'll also remember our candid conversations about each other's hopes and plans for the future, including me trying to explain the history of my country as the three of us (him, my fiancee and I) laboriously climbed back up the steps at Gunung Kawi.The lad may be young but he's very steeped in culture, wisdom and passion in keeping the spirit of traditional Balinese dance and music alive. I've grown to love the Balinese way of life (not the surfing culture though), and have every intention of coming back again soon - this time with friends. Thank you very much, Nyoman. It's been a memorable trip for the both of us, and we will definitely be in touch with you during our next trip!- With very best regards from friends in Singapore"

Ketut arrived on time and the car was as described and very comfortable, Ketut has good english and the tour was a delight - we managed to have ample time at all stops and took in local cultural stops (including a wedding), everywhere we went, Ketut offered interesting commentary and explanation and handled everything including entry tickets, even stopping off for us to take lunch at a restaurant and a mini mart to take snacks back to our hotel - the service from Ketut was first class and exceeded the service we had received in other private hires we have used across the globe.We were so delighted with our day that we went on to book another trip whilst we were in Bali - taking in the monkey forest and Tanah Lot temple, Ketut was busy this day and supplied a driver - as equally a fantastic day!We cannot recommend Bali Traditional Tours highly enough - this is our first review on Trip Advisor and we felt the need to start reviewing after benefiting from others review of this company - If you are looking for a driver in Bali please use Ketut and Bali Traditional Tours!"

We arranged 3 full day tours with Bali Traditional Tours and had the privilege of being shown around the beautiful island with Nyoman as our knowledgeable, enthusiastic and friendly guide. As mentioned before Nyoman is a fantastic ambassador for his country and our time with him gave us a unique insight into the culture, religion and traditions of Balinese people. We take back home so many fond memories of our time in Bali, from eating noodle soup from the back of a bike in the pouring rain to feeding monkeys bananas by the side of the rice paddies and many many more! We feel extremely lucky to have had the opportunity to meet Nyonman and count him as a friend!Thank you, your English friends Lauren and Kirstin."

He has studied both English and religion and is proficient with both.Ketut arrived at our hotel as scheduled in a large, air conditioned van in good condition. We began the day by discussing what we wanted to see. When we mentioned that we weren't interested in some of the sites on the set itinerary, he readily offered alternative itineraries for our day. My wife mentioned a temple that she was very interested in seeing and, even though it was fairly far out of the way, Ketut did not hesitate to add it to our plan. We truly felt like it was OUR day.Everywhere we went, Ketut offered interesting commentary and explanation. He always handled all of the logistics, finding parking, paying for tickets, showing us where to walk. We felt very comfortable and secure. Just one anecdote that really shows how special this tour was. After the regularly scheduled itinerary plus the added temple for my wife, we expected to be brought back to our hotel. Ketut asked if there was anything else that we were interested in seeing while we were in Bali. When we mentioned that we were interested in going to Celuk, a town known for jewelry south of Ubud, he drove out of his way to the town. When we did not find any jewelry we liked at the first shop, he brought us to an jeweler across town. Considering our tour had already lasted more than eight hours, he really went above and beyond all of our expectations.If you are looking for a driver to give you a tour around Bali... just call Bali Traditional Tours. Trust me, you won't regret it."

Ketut Mawa, our guide was very professional and personable who really gave us a taste of the wonderful Balinese culture. His English was excellent. He was able to describe with just the right amount of detail the various aspects of the social, cultural and religuous life of his people. As it was a sunday we asked if he could drive us from Ubud to the Denpasar Catholic church for our service at 7am. this was just fine and he then took us to a typical roadside restaurant for a very yummy breaksfast. The Itinerary we went on was to the Kintamani mountain whereby we stopped at a small local market then visited the ruins of the Gunung Kawi Temple Complex. He took us up to Mt Batur lookout where we had a pleasant lunch with a stunning view of the volacano and crater lake. After lunch it was off to an agro tourism mixed crop plantation where we had coffee and tea tasting. Wonderful tastes. It was also a lesson in sustainable agriculture. It was a good place to buy edible presents. It is slightly more expensive than in Kuta but you know the money goes straight to the producers. We then went to Tirta Empul Holy Water Temple where there were many rituals happening. To finish off the trip we visted the Tegallantang Rice terraces. These were all stunning places which also were much more alive because Ketut Mawa made them come to life to describe some of the subtleties of Balinese life.We finished our day at 5.30pm quite enriched by this taste of Balinese life thanks to Ketut. Long life and success to Ketut in his efforts."

Nyoman was always looking out for our best interests. It made getting around, seeing the sights, and learning about Bali easy and stress-free. A few highlights for us: meeting the family including Nyoman's wife and beautiful babies, having the best meal of our stay in Bali at a roadside restaurant that we would never be able to find again, and driving home in a torrential thunderstorm and almost no visibility (made it back safely!)."

A friend I met in Bali recommended his friend Ketut as a tour guide, because I was looking for a low key, low stress, easy day of touring and had specific places in mind. Ketut was very friendly, down to earth, and has a wonderful command of the English language, and we shared language tips and phrases. He was able to teach me many aspects of Balinese culture beyond what I had expected or would have thought to ask, as well as followed up on anything he taught me to make sure I remembered. I had asked Ketut if I could bring my Balinese friend - who turned out to be a childhood friend of Ketut's, and so that brought another element of delight to the day as the friend had not seen much of what we did, either. The friend took my camera and took many delightful pictures for and of me. Ketut completely tailored the day to match whatever I felt like doing and had suggestions as well. He drove me through countryside, we stopped at small stands, we went to temples, rice fields, a traditional (not tourist) market, and even stopped by the side of a road to try Durian fruit. He did the bargaining for me when I did not feel up to it.Next time I come to Bali I will hire Ketut for several days and get around the island more. I did hire him to take me to the airport the day I left as well.Prices were right for what is the 'going rate' in Bali. He had bottled water for me and was very willing to stop when I was hungry, thirsty, or to find a local warung for coffee. He communicated with me constantly and made sure every thing was as I desired. I felt very happy with the entire experience."

The night before our tour, he phoned us at the hotel and started apologizing profusely, saying that because his six-month-old twins were having their hair-cutting ceremony the next day, he had to send his uncle, Wayan, to take us on the tour instead. To compensate, he invited us to his house to watch some of the ceremony, and it turned out to be the high point of our stay! Nyoman and his family live in a traditional Balinese family compound (and have done so since 1860!) and his father is one of the three priests in their village, so it was a real honour and privilege to be present at the ceremony, which was, like other things in Bali, very focused and precise but yet entirely relaxed and unpompous. The tour with Uncle Wayan was wonderful too (my 76-year-old mum was inspired to climb all 350 steps down and UP to see Gunung Kawi temple, and was still smiling at the end). I learned a lot about Balinese culture from both Wayan and Nyoman, and would book another tour with them in a heartbeat."

He brought my wife, daughter and myself on a really interesting and insightful tour that started in Ubud and brought us to some of the best sights in Bali.The day began with a trip to the Monkey Forest. We enjoyed a walk around the forest where we were able to get really close to the monkeys. They are really very tame although I did see them going to a few people and trying to take food out of their bags. If you have food they will come and take it off you. From there we traveled to Lake Bratan to see the Ulun Danu Temple which is located on the shores of Lake Bratan surrounded by beautiful gardens. On the way we took a brief break at a coffee and coco plantation to stretch our legs and taste some freshly ground balinese coffee. They have a number of types of coffee and tea available for tasting and a cup of the world famous Luwak coffee can be purchased for $4.Thoroughly recommended. Following this we headed to the Jatiluwih Rice Terraces and lunch in the Wr Dhea restaurant. The food here was absolutely beautiful and offered great value for money. This restaurant cooks meals to order unlike a lot of the premises along the way which have a buffet so you know what you get will be good. After this we made our way to Tanah Lot Temple located on the coast. This was the last stop of the day and from there we returned to out hotel in Ubud.Throughout the day Nyoman was a fountain of information. He explained the history of each of the sites we visited as well as telling us about many of the Balinese traditions we came across during the day. He was an excellent tour guide and a true gentleman. He is a man with immense knowledge of the island and its ways of life. He takes great joy in telling people of the Balinese way of life and he strives to ensure that your tour is a truly wonderful experience. Thank you Nyoman for a great day."

We had a large group of 12 people so we had both Nyoman and Ketut as our tour guides for both days. We had opted for customised tours and had sent a wishlist to Nyoman beforehand so he can plan the best route. Our first day we told him we wanted to visit Ubud and have lunch at the famous Ibu Oka. On the way to Ubud, Nyoman was full of information about Bali and the local life and going ons. He was very patient with answering our questions and would answer any questions we had. Due to very heavy rain after lunch, we were unable to continue further north as the roads were getting dangerous to navigate.Our second day we went to a coffee plantation, Bratan temple, Jatilwah rice terrace and Tanah Lot. We even made impromptu stops on the side of the road at fruit stalls to load up on durians and mangosteens. One of the best Balinese food we had was at the rice terrace at a local restaurant recommended by Nyoman instead of the touristy buffet restaurant further up the road. This little restaurant was situated literally next to the rice field where you go up to the rice plants and touch them.Nyoman and Ketut were both very friendly and eager to show off their country. They are very informative and know alot about Bali traditions and everyday life. They even told us about their family and village where they live. There are still so many places in Bali that we wish to visit. Next time we will definitley be booking with Nyoman and Ketut."

Our tour guide was confirmed as Ketut and i am sure he is just as good! he and Nyoman are cousins who run the business together and he was absolutely fantastic. he has such a wonderful personality that we instantly felt comfortable with him, his english is also excellent. we booked the Bedugul tour but we really wanted to see Tanah Lot for sunset and were happy to miss out on one of the other temples instead but Ketut took us to all 3 temples for no extra charge! he thought that we would have a better understanding of Bali if we saw all 3 and i am so glad we did. Ketut was great at explaining everything to us but not overloading us with information so that we did not remember it. his sense of humour is great and we spent so much time having fun, after we visited a location he would ask us some questions about what he had told us like a pop quiz to see if we remembered and i am so grateful of this, he made sure we had understood and remembered all the important things. he answered every question we had about everything and is so much detail. Ketut has a university diploma in english and hindu traditional culture/religion which makes him so knowledgeable and because he is so enthusiastic and absolutely loves everything that he is giving us infirmation about it is so easy to learn and take it in, he is a natural teacher and people person. He shared a lot about his life with us which was something we didnt get anywhere else, we could ask him any question and he would answer, he is a very wise a perceptive man for such a young age and you can tell he has a lot of respect for people and nature. he is also the best driver we had in Bali!the places we visited on out tour are as followsTaman Ayun temple, Coffee plantation, local market, buffet lunch in the mountains, Ulan Danu temple, rice terraces, Tanah Lot templeyou could fit more into one day if you wanted but we preferred to spend more time at a location and see less places rather than more, also we stayed in seminyak which is quite a drive and we started at 10am. we would have liked to see a school but since our tour was on sunday we could not as school is not on, on sunday. we did not get to see a ceremony at all as there were not many on, Ketut explained that today was a special day on the balinese calendar where most people spend the day at a body of water, beach, river, lake to celebrate. instead he told us in depth about the different temple ceremonies they have and what they do to prepare and celebrate. as we were on our honeymoon he also told us all about their weddings which was very interesting and next time we are in Bali he wants to organise for us to see a Balinese wedding, we will take him up on this offer if we go back.the coffee plantation was not just coffee either, they also grow cocoa, jackfruit, snakeskin fruit, tumerick, ginger, lemongrass and much more! he explained their uses and how they are processed and showed us all the plants and the produce. we got to taste a variety of coffees and teas and cocoa for free with no pressure to buy. they also have some Luwak animals there which are so cute!when we went to the market Ketut showed us different things that Balinese people use in everyday life and what the stalls were selling. he bought some snakeskin fruit for himself as it was his favourite and was offering it to us to eat all day, he wanted to share literally everything he had with us!when we went to the rice terraces, we were taking photos from the lookout where most people were, i heard another lady ask her tour guide if she could driver through to the other side to take photos and he told her that it would cost 10 000rp per person to go over there, we asked Ketut if we could go to the other side and he said yes no mention of the charge, when we went to the entrance he just paid the 20 000 for the two of us and gave us the tickets, he did not even try to get us to pay where as other tour guides were saying entry was not included in their tour and you have to pay, not that it is a lot of money but Ketut paid for all entry costs wherever we went and was happy to take us to places which were not strictly on the tour we booked. after Tanah Lot where we watched the sunset it was dark and we were thinking that thats the end of the tour but Ketut asked us if there was anything else we wanted to see, he was still happy to take us to see other things! we said that we were happy to go back to our villa and if he wanted we would pay for him to come out to dinner with us. he politely declined because he had to go to the hospital to see his Aunt who had given birth to her first child that day! It was amazing that he was still offering to take us places after Tanah Lot even thought he didn't have to and he had other important places to be!i would definitely recommend booking a tour with Bali Traditional Tours, if we had gone to these places ourselves we would not know anything about the significance of them and we were able to appreciate them so much more with everything that Ketut told to us. we had an incredible day and this was definitely the best tour we did. If we go back to Bali we will book another tour with Ketut to see other places for sure."

He answered all of our questions and really helped us feel connected to the amazing people of Bali. We were able to customize our tour to what we wanted to see for a very reasonable price. We spent a day touring on our own, and our time with Ketut was what was really memorable and educational. I give this tour my highest recommendation!"

Basedon the positive reviews, I booked with Nyoman.He was helpful over the the internet even before we arrived in Bali with suggestions for what we could do on our day tour. When the actual day came, Nyoman was on time and dressed in Traditional Balinese gear. He spoke English very well and immediately we felt comfortable with him. His Car was spacious, clean and air conditioned. He is also a reliable driver.Nyoman is a lovely young bloke that works hard and knows Bali intimately. He has a great sense of humour and it proud of his island. he will teach you things you never knew and will answer any questions you could dream up. He even learnt some choice Aussie slang that we taught him. So watch out if he lays it on when he find out you are from Australia!!We had a great day and we bought him lunch as he was just so nice. It was very cheap and delicious.We saw the Unesco rice paddies, temples, village festivals lot lots more. I highly reccomend this personal and entertaining day trip. Nyoman works for his family and not some big tour organisation. He deserves the great reviews and if I go back to Bali I will probably look him up again."

It was our first trip to Bali and we wanted to see as much as we could. All three of our tours were fantastic. The first tour was with Nyoman ( Nyoman Grago's uncle). the tour was very good and Nyoman was very informative. I would recommend tours with him.However, our second two tours were with Nyoman Grago and they were even more wonderful. We felt like Nyoman was a friend that we had known for a long time. He is so friendly and helpful and he makes it very easy to spend the day with him talking and exploring Bali. I don't know if I have ever met a kinder person with more energy and excitement for life. The highlight of our 2 weeks in Bali were our two days with Nyoman. Particularly when we visited his home. His whole family was very kind and his new twin babies are beautiful. I even got to hold his beautiful daughter. The fact the he welcomed us into his home like old friends was so gracious. It was also a great way to experience true Balinese living.Overall the tours were great. Nyoman was wonderful. He is very knowledgeable and speaks wonderful English. Probably the best English we encountered on our whole trip. We felt like we didn't just have a good tour, that we made a friend. THANK YOU Nyoman for a great experience. - with love, Jen and Eric"

Travelling with two young children from the US, we wanted everything booked in advance. As Kutut as our guide, we discovered Bali in a very intimate, personal way. Ketut provided a wealth of information about the Balinese religion, socioeconomic structure, culture, ceremonies and daily life. He accommodated all of our special needs with kids with patience, kindness, and gentleness toward our children and ourselves. The more interested we became to explore Bali, the more eager he became to teach us and show us around, often changing the itinerary and going off the beaten path to give us a more authentic experience. In fact, we felt so connected to him, we added on an additional day and he drove us to the airport with gracious farewells. There is no doubt that we will return to Bali as it is one of the most special places we have been. We cannot wait to visit with Ketut and experience more of Bali with his tours."

We went to Royal temple at Pura Taman Ayun, the rice terraces at Jatiluwih (where we had an excellent lunch) ending up on the coast at Tanah Lot temple. On the way Nyoman noticed a ceremony in a small town, and produced 2 sarongs from the car so we could enter the courtyard. We were welcomed by the local people ( we were the only tourists ) and had a fantastic hour listening to the female musicians Gamelan band. For $70 dollars this was a bargain!. Our tour was not a set tour, I think you can suggest your own itinerary..to suit yourself, providing no-one else is on board. Nyoman was good company, knowledgeable, helpful and his English was excellentWe cannot recommend this highly enough."

We had an idea of what we wanted to do (temples, coffee and spice plantation. Lake Bratan and the herons returning to roost) but he stopped off along the way so we could watch the kids at their sunday Gamelan class . He also took us to the rice terraces - a world heritage site. All entrance fee's were included and all for the fee of $75 for the 6 of us!!! Tip generously, we hired him again for half a day and he had to shell out for a 'fine' for the police and then we found out that over half of what he was charging us was going on the car hire!!! From that you can gather it was lovely air-con people carrier!! Two fab days out - don't hesitate to book and have a real inside take on to Bali life !!"

They displayed flexibility from the offset and provided a cattered program that allowed my family of grownups to fully enjoy every moment of the day they spent out and about. Our guide, Ketut, was extremely patient and didn't mind repeating the information he provided us with on the Balinese culture, mainly around theirs religion. He allowed us to seize opportunities that arise during the tour, to get closer with the population involved in cultural activities. He adapted the program, based on our expectations, avoiding redundancy where we didn't want it, and allowing it for activities we liked doing. He provided very good advice on the \"clean\" restaurant, and brought us to those that provided extra, such as a stunning view on rice terrasses and Mount & Lake Batur; on the beach, directly on the side of rice fields, etc. For souvenirs, he brought us to family owned businesses, which were not as expensive as those targetting the mass tourism. In the local markets, he made suggestions about what we could try. He brought us to a temple where a colony of monkeys resided, which were a lot less aggressive than the ones in reknown places. This provided a very close encounter with them, along with the giant fruit-eating bats. He was very proactive in proposing to take family photos and knew exactly where to take them to have the best effect. In a sum, he allowed to fully optimise the little time we had to see as much as possible of Bali. On top of it, he does support good causes with the children. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this company. They are excellent, and extremely cheap considering what they provide."

We all agreed that this day trip was one of the highlights of our visit to Bali.My son and I hired a driver on another day to go to some places around Ubud, ony to find that he was from near Denpasar and was unfamiliar with the local area.

He was late to pick us up and was not organised as it seemed he had little notice that he was doing our tour. It was school holidays when we were there and we didnt get to go to a school which was just unfortunate but we also didnt get to see a local market and our tour guide also did not take us to Ulun Danu Batur Temple and its neighbor Pura Pucak Tuluk Biyu which I didnt realise until after I looked at the itinarary.The tour also included a visit to a local cultural event and a Balinese household which also didnt happen.What we did see we enjoyed but as I stated at the start I was hoping to really love this tour but I really could have got any driver to take us to the places we did get to see for a lot less money and it would have been the same. This tour was average and I could not recommend this tour as we missed seeing so much of the \"Traditional Bali\" that I was looking forward to."

It was fun to spend our days travelling with Ketut because at the end of each tour, he asked us to remember what we had seen at each sight. We jotted down some notes on each temple/ sight so that we could answer correctly. He is a great asset to Traditional Tours. The tours offered are personalized and suited to traveler who want an understanding of the history, traditions and village life in Bali.

We went to several of the sites off his listed tours and other things we wanted to see. When he says he is your personal guide he means it. One of the really interesting things we did was the kecak dance and while other guides just herded in their clients in, Nyomen walked us to our seats and then brought us bottled waters during the show as it was extremely hot as we were packed in the large crowd. To add to the real experience we were invited to his home to see his family's humble compound with several family units and their own temple (as Bali is the land of 3 million temples). There are so many temples with unique features to see so one will have to explore these for themselves. Other notable things were the Monkey forest in Ubud and Ubud itself.

All three of us enjoyed our first day-long tour so much that we decided to spend four more days with Ketut and with Nyoman! Their English is excellent, their vehicles are very comfortable, and there is really no question they cannot answer--abour Balinese dance, religion, food, family, geography, and history (both are well-read and university-educated),They took exceptionally good care of us, determining right from the start what we knew and what we wanted to know--even what foods our kids liked (and didn't like) and what they wanted to do. They then made a careful plan and discussed it with us, and planned everything with impressive effeciency. We met teachers and kids in a local village school (this was so much fun and very memorable for our kids), got to listen to gamelan music at local cafes (where the food was great and not on the tourist trail), and enjoyed ice-cream with local children. Our kids learned more detail about volcanoes than they bargained for, and we are now speaking just enough Balinese to access places and people we just couldn't meet before. Their vehicles are very comfortable and safe. They know where to find the souvenirs we wanted, and which sights we should see--at what times and in what order, given traffic and road conditions.So much of our trip was spent with these two.

We had only left with a little amount of money so we had no money for lunch( due to there being no atms around that area) and he gave us $500,000 rup no worries i was astounded by his kindness and we gave him a tip and asked him to have lunch with us ( We are not the type of people who let our tour operators sit in the car while we eat). He has so much knowledge of the culture and has a fantastic personality. We enjoyed every single moment on this tour and the next time we come to Bali we will be booking further tours with him. We went to the coffee plantation , Gunung Kawi Temple, Tirta Empul Holy Water Temple and Kintamani . At the Holy water temple Nyoman showed us how to be apart of the culture by showing us what to do when the priest blesses you. It was not only great value for money but we will remember this for a lifetime :)"

A trip to Bali would not be complete without spending time on a personalized tour with Nyoman. His knowledge of the history of the Hindu temples and his willingness to impart it along with showing us the real culture of Bali made this tour a highlight of our trip. Nyoman's English is excellent and his friendly and engaging personality make him the perfect partner to see Bali with. We can not recommend Bali Traditional Tours enough, so don't miss out on booking a trip with Nyoman."

This trip to Bali was predominantly a SCUBA diving holiday but we did want to experience some of the Balinese culture so stayed 3 nights in Ubud before heading to the dive regions of Tulamben & Menjangan Island.On our first day in Ubud we did the Bedugul Tour with Nyoman Grago of Bali Traditional Tours. He had also arranged our airport transfers to Ubud by private car on the previous afternoon. Nyoman is both guide and driver; a very friendly, professional & knowledgeable young man whose English is excellent. We visited a primary school, a traditional fruit & vegetable market at Bedugul, Pura Ulun Danu Temple which is located on Lake Bratan, and the beautiful Taman Ayun Mangwi Temple, as well as a tea & coffee plantation. Nyoman even took us to his home to meet his family. Nothing was too much trouble and the tour was great value as rate is per car not per person. Would use again and happy to recommend to anyone."

Before I left on my trip I did alot of research on Tours and through Trip Advisory I learnt about a gentleman named Nyoman form Bali Traditional Tours, all the reviews written about him were lovely so I was interested and eager in experiencing a Tour with him during my time in BaliWhen I went to Bali I never in a million years expected to find a friend, and that is exactly what Nyoman has become to me and my family. Nyoman was the best part of our trip and not just because he was our paid tour guide but because Nyoman is both honest and thoughtful and so beautiful on this inside, we were able to experience The Real Bali and had your site not existed we would have never met the man who definately changed my life.We could never say enough positive things about Nyoman or what he now means to us but I will say this - If you are travelling to Bali and you want to experience it with an honest, respectful, happy, humble, kind and beautiful soul look no further Nyoman is who you need!!Thank you Nyoman for taking care of us, for teaching us about what life in Bali is really like. Thank you for sharing your stories and listening to ours, thank you for your smile and making us smile but more than all of the above thank you for teaching me what's important in life. I live in a very beautiful house, I drive a nice car and I have a great job but I have not been so happy, you don't have any of the things I have and yet you smile and laugh and love every day - because of you Nyoman I now know what's important, meeting you has changed my life.We love you, and we love Bali - Wyarn (Donna) Wyarn (Miki) and Ketut (Carmen) xx"

In addition, he took us to the famous rice terraces of Bali, as well as a number of temple grounds and to meet with a real medicine man.

At Pura Tirtha Empul (Holy Spring Temple), we were fortunate to see 2 mating snakes which, according to Nyoman, was extremely lucky if he could touch them with any personal clothing. Although he didn\u2019t managed to, we were glad to have shared the exciting moment with him! Nyoman was very patient with our 4 children and answered all their questions clearly. As the kids were not too interested in temples, he suggested other places to visit and was even generous to invite us to visit his own home! He introduced us to his extended family as well as explained the residential layout to us. It was the highlight of our trip for the kids to handle day-old chicks and see the family\u2019s very clean pigs! If you need transport just to bring you shopping or to beaches, any private drivers will do. But if you are visiting temples, rice terraces, mountains, etc, I highly recommend Nyoman. His knowledge, cheerfulness and warmth made the experience so much more interesting and enjoyable. We left Bali with a better understanding of the culture of its people. Thank you, Nyoman."

Before our family (myself , wife and two sons aged 16 and 11) trip to Bali I found reviews of Bali Traditional Tours here on Tripadvisor and emailed Nyoman to book 3 separate day tours. The replies were prompt and friendly and all was booked up ready for us to arrive. Like others here I was a bit doubtful that it could be that good given the very modest price.So on the day of the first tour, our guide Ketut arrived to pick us up at our villa. At first I was a little disappointed that the legendary Nyoman had not arrived but this feeling was soon dispelled as Ketut turned out to be an extremely charming, friendly, knowledgeable and overall excellent guide.So we went out on three full day trips with Ketut. These were the Bedugul tour, the Kintamani tour and the South Bali tour. All of these I would highly recommend.The tours involve visiting many temples where the entrance is included in the tour price. Ketut seemed to know everything about all of the temples we visited and also filled us in with a lot of detail about Balinese life which was most welcome. Also provided were the sarongs needed to enter some temples. Many of the temple sites are stunning and unmissable but I will not go into the detail here.Other highlights included a coffee plantation (where you can taste the famous luak coffee made from beans that pass through the digestive system of a civet cat).Another interesting spot was a temple with monkey and giant fruit bats which you can handle.The final trip finished up at Uluwatu temple where at sunset we saw the famous Kecak dance performed (there is an additinal charge for the entrance to this). This is a stunning performance which must not be missed.At all times Ketut was kind and helpful. He did not takes us to places to buy stuff which some guides do. Indeed wherever we were he advised us on what we should do when approached by sellers and what would be fair prices. Invalluable information.Overall I could not recommend this company more. The transport is a high quality air conditioned Toyota. The price if fantastic. The guide is superb and the locations you are taken to are unbeatable.Thankyou Ketut (and Nyoman) and hope to see you again some day."

Ketut is simply amazing - his English is excellent, he is kind, funny, and professional. Ketut listened carefully to what we wanted to see and then made it all happen. He met us at our hotel, treated us with great respect, brought along sarongs for our temple visits, and was well versed in Hindu/Balinese culture and traditions. Our conversations were both educational and enjoyable. We had used other drivers in Ubud - but often felt we lost so much of the richness of the culture because of our language differences.

When we eventually met and got to know him we found him to be young (mid 20's I would guess), very polite, with a university education that included religious studies, good looking and seemingly known to everyone in the areas we visited. Each day was long, around 10-12 hours. He took us to so many temple events that we would not have otherwise seen and explained all of our questions about Hindu rituals and beliefs. Most of the time we were off the tourist beaten track and that is how we like it.We bought him lunch to eat with us each day and he was genuinely grateful as I think that the sons of rice farmers do not eat out much if at all. He brings an innocence, a freshness and a graceful charm to the sometimes jaded and routine business of tour guiding.We would not hesitate to recommend him to you. His tours are very reasonable in price. Do not miss meeting and getting to know Nyoman."

His knowledge of the culture, not to mention he's education in reading and understanding Sanskrit allows for him to review the Hindu calendar for special events and festivals in the region. This, as it would turn out is a rare ability, and would be particularly important as we were able to attend a festival in one village that happens every thirty five years!   We moved our tour days around his schedule which upon his suggestions would turn into the most memorable events each day we met. Festivals, Cremation ceremonies, specialty tours around East Bali including the Bali Aga ( 11th Century Hindu settlement ) at Tengenan Village. His tours we're fascinating and his explanations rich with detail and a delight. Don't miss this one if you have the opportunity.

We saw a side of Bali that we did not know existed, Nyoman took us to temples and explained to us what everything meant and the traditions behind the ceremonies we where lucky to see a ceremony at a small local temple which is only performed every 35 years, we would never have seen the things we did without Nyoman. He is so friendly and truly passionate about his country and showing it to visitors. His knowledge of history and religion is amazing but at the same time he is funny and very entertaining to be with.Nyoman customised the two tours for us after we explained what we wanted to see and do. We travelled in air-conditioned comfort in a very nice 4 wheel drive. I would highly recommend the elephant safari park in Ubud, where we fed baby elephants. We saw Mount Kintamani which is normally covered in clouds but on the day we went the sky was clear, it was an incredable sight, Lake Bratan is another sight not to be missed, it has a temple built on the water. the only disapointment was Tahah Lot Temple, while this is a very holy temple to the people of Bali the crowds of tourists at sunset spoil the atmosphere,there are everywhere.

We're not very experienced travellers (this was our first visit to Asai) and were not really confident about travelling around on our own. I found the reviews of Bali Traditional Tours on trip advisor and (having read some not-so-good reviews of other tour companies in Bali) decided to contact Nyoman to see whether he was available. We booked the Kintamani Tour but Nyoman amended it to include the Monkey Forest that we were keen to visit. The minute I met Nyoman in the foyer of our hotel, I knew we were going to have a fantastic time. Such a friendly lad with excellent English. He immediately put us both at ease. The tour was brilliant. Nyoman's knowledge of his culture and religion is fascinating. We were so thrilled that we ended up booking another two tours with Bali Traditional Tours during our time in Bali. The tours really were the highlight of our trip.We've read other reviews of tours in Bali where people are constantly taken to different shops (woodcarving, jewellery etc,) and encouraged to buy things by the guide (so he can get commission). This will NOT happen with Bali Traditional Tours. Nyoman did take us to one woodcarving shop because we specifically asked him to. However, he gave us advice about bargaining to get a good price and told us that we should not feel pressured to buy anything unless we want to. Nyoman is a genuinely lovely young man who is keen to show tourists the best that the island has to offer. I have already recommended Bali Traditional Tours to two of my friends.Thanks for making our trip so special Nyoman!"

We covered many temples, villages, physical sites, rice paddies, etc. Always prompt and always accomodating (he provided umbrellas and clothing needed to enter temples), Nyoman was very flexible and picked some special ceremonies, that occur very infrequently. At one temple we met the Regent and that was fun! We even worshipped with him in the mother termple, Besakih. He provided the history and culture of his wonderful island and people. He even sang to us and put on the head of a pig to show us he he could dance. It was a great four days- thanks so much, Nyoman!"

Before the trip, their responses to my emails were fast and very informative helping us to make the best decisions about what to see on our first trip to Bali. Whilst we were in Bali the team were punctual and very personable.On the first day we did the Bedugul Tour with Nyomen. The trip was varied with lots of different elements of Balinese life but best of all it was a private tour. This gave us loads of opportunity to talk to Nyomen our guide about life in Bali. In addition to the 'set' tour Nyomen also took us to a temple that was having a celebration that takes place only once in every 35 years. We really feel that we learnt lots about balinese culture and life in general Nyomen gave us a real insight into Bali - something that we wouldn't have got on a big group tour.On the second day we had a Custom Tour where we decided the things that we wanted to see. In fact we didn't chose enough to fill the day but Ketut our guide added sights to the tour as we went along making this a second great day.Bali Traditional Tours offer great value for money and a really personal service. They made us feel very special and we would definitely choose them again."

Before departing, i researched tour companies online. i chose Bali Traditional Tours because it seemed to feature more of the real life of the Balinese. i was not disappointed. Our guide, Nyoman is a gentle soul, full of pride in his country and culture. Along with an inside look at the myriad, fantastic temples, we were treated to a family run coffee plantation (where we tasted some very \"special\" coffee), a primary school (where my daughter had a real chance to exchange with children her own age), we helped make Balinese sea salt, held and fed a giant bat... the experiences went on and on. What started as a single day tour, turned into 5 days together with custom tours, special stops and a real insiders look at the island and its beautiful people. Nyoman took special care to always include my daughter, teaching her about each place, the Gods and Goddesses, and the village customs and celebrations. We spent much time laughing at the vast differences between New York and Bali. I cannot recommend Bali Traditional Tours enough. Their kindness and care is a window to the spirit of this magical place."

He was particularly good at keeping our teenagers happy and engaged. (Never an easy task!) He also went above and beyond the call of duty. Our airline tickets had to be couriered to Bali, but since we did not know what day they would arrive, we didn't know where to have them delivered. Nyoman had them sent to his home and personally delivered them to us. That kind of dedication and service is sums up why we were so happy to spend our time with Nyoman and his company."

Try this tour guide there is heaps to see on the Island and the roads are difficult to try on your own.  The guide at Bali Traditional Tours - Nyomam was excellent. He had an assistant driver in a very comfortable sedan vehicle fully air conditioned. We started early 8:30am and got back at about 6:30pm. The tour was full of 4 major temple visits. A visit to a farm in the jungle with coffee & tea & cocoa tasting. Yes also the Luwak coffee, I didn't like it but loved the ginger tea. Saw fruits never seen before. Also spices not seen growing and a great \"lost\" sort of wonderland. Ate lunch (not included in the tour) at a well recommended restaurant by the guide, that felt like it was on top of the world. Had a view of the volcano & lake while having an incredible fresh meal with a difference. Bali food is great! Highly recommend you try it.  Nyoman took care of all the special needs of a tourist - the sarong when required, water, he took care of all entrance fees and parking fees quickly and smoothly you hardly knew it was taking place. Bali rice farmers at work and their great terraced rice Paddie fields.  Nyoman is a great ambassador of his religion and was very helpful in explaining everything. He treasurers his home and it certainly rubs off on you.  So get away from the beach and city and really see Bali with Nyoman - I am so glad I found him.  Enjoy your Tour, I know you will."

            "review": "bali traditional tours. This is my second trip to bali and i agree that with some other reviewers here that one option to see the real bali is to hire a driver and go visit the various tourist sites in this isle of the Gods. I am a season traveller and am not a fan of cookier cutter type of tours which take on literally busloads of tourist and shuttle from one site to another without seeing the real people and the real countryside. So it was a pleasant surprise (and i dare say so too with some luck) that i stumbled on this outfit through google search - 'balitraditionaltours' and the itinerary was unique and very localised with a stop at a local primary school and various temples and rice fields on the outfields of ubud. It started with a friendly welcome from nyoman, pronounced as 'norman' who picked me up from the hotel and communication was easy as he spoke fluent english and displayed a great deal of knowledge about balinese culture. Apart from nyoman he has other friends who can provide tour services in french and spanish. Nyoman is a local graduate from bali who studied balinese history and culture and it was his understanding of customs and culture that made the outing very memorable. Our first stop is a local primary school and balinese kids and their teachers are welcoming to visitors in true balinese hospitality. For those of you who really want to get to know the locals this is a heart warming way to make friends (albeit young friends) and kids being kids are not camera shy to have their pictures taken. I suppose many of them dont get visitors often and to them we tourists are the real 'tourist attraction'We moved on to the Bedugul temple and it was a special holy day and there was much to see with the beautiful processions and 'gamelan' music accompanying the villagers into the temple. An awesome sight to behold rich in colour, reverance and significance. All through this while, nyoman provided indepth explanations of the customs, how he too worships at this temple with his village. Before long, you do feel you are in the company of a local friend and not just a guide as he shares his own personal experiences going through the rituals and the significance of the events bears to him, this does give you a better and unique insight to the real balinese people.The journey north into the breathtaking rice fields of Jatiluwih pronounced as 'jut-tee-loo-wee' is really picture perfect and for those of you who romanticise on visiting asia to see the rice terraces, this is one place worth seeing. It gives one a sense of serenity and tranquil strolling in the rice fields. I will be glad to recommend this outfit to anyone who is looking to see the real soul of bali and meet its local people in the process. That is really the spirit of travels and not visits to shopping outlets with hordes of other tourists. This is an independent company and nyoman who is both manager and guide offers one the flexibility to adjust the tour according to your preferred interest. I enjoy photography so having made my interest known, there was no shortage of picturesque stops to suit me. Transportation was in a comfortable and new 4x4 vehicle which given the balinese terrain is comfortable yet robust enough to navigate the winding roads where no big tour buses can pass. So in short, for those of you who want an off the beaten path experience in bali with a professional, knowledgeable, extrememly friendly and warm guide as your friend, i will highly recommend balitraditionaltours."

My wife put a post up on \"Bali Bogans\" an Australian Facebook group seeking a Tour Guide and Driver for her 'Nerd Husband'. Mr.Bedu was highly recommended. I'm actually a Social Science & Drama Teacher and as such was seeking an honest look at Bali, Indonesia from a locals perspective. Through out the day I pestered Mr. Bedu with questions on culture, social issues, politics, religion and gender roles throughout our day was fantastic. His command of English, understanding of why I was asking these things and patience with my need to stop and photograph things was much appreciated. My review is written with some bias. Although it was only a one day tour and it was a professional arrangement it is hard not to become friends with Mr. Bedu. His love for his country, its people and his casual and polite manner is hard not to befriend. He know a lot of locals of course, enjoys a joke and ok me to some truly sensational places. Waterfalls, plantations, rice terraces, monkey forests, little villages, busy roads and temples and all in a few short hours. Regardless of if you are travelling alone or in a small group of 5 or 6 I have no doubt you will be satisfied with this young mans knowledge, organisation, professionalism and cleanliness. The car is well cared for, reliable and clearly a symbol of pride for him. I am certain he will not disappoint and works hard to remain flexible and yet ensure the best experience given the changeable conditions of the region. Lastly I would like share his recommendation which I will follow on my next visit. Often tourists first visit is centred around Kuta which is essentially the beach strip and 'tourist party central'. Mr. Bedu suggested that next time we look at say 3 or 4 days of the week being located in or near Ubud which is central to the island and the artisan and cultural hub of Bali. Of course there are still a lot of tourists but it's also central to Tourist ventures such as the Monkeys, Elephants, sunrise over the Volcano, ATV adventures, rafting and other such persuits where as if you are at Kuta these are an hour drive or more away. Follow up the trip with 3 or 4 days in Kuta, a much busier and touristy experience which is also close to the airport for a stress free departure. Well, as stress free as Bali traffic can be. Being close means less chance of being held up for a flight trying to get through the city. All in all a most amazing experience and a single day with Mr. Bedu was enough of a taste of Bali to secure my return in the future. I have no hesitation recommending him for day or even an extended trip. If I could make one more suggestion and that would be book him early as I have no doubt this young man will be certainly an asset who will be in high demand during the peak seasons. Well done Mr. Bedu on providing such a professional and affordable service for those which to experience the best Bali has to offer."

Having never visited Bali before, I looked to the internet and hired Mr. Bedu as our tour guide for an airport pickup and drive to Ubud, Mount Batur trek and day tour. I'm sure that I asked so many questions that I started to become annoying but he remained patient and answered all of my questions before my arrival in Bali and during our stay in Bali. During our stay in Ubud, we ended up deciding to do an additional last minute day tour with another driver to West Bali because Bedu was not available. The driver got us to the places we asked but did not take the time to explain what we were seeing or make recommendations on nearby attractions. We later learned that we had missed an important landmark on that side of the island! We may never get to see it again!In contrast, our experience with Bedu was so different. Even though our airport pickup was at 1am and our plane was delayed, he happily chatted with us all the way to Ubud and made itinerary, restaurant recommendations - all of which were spot on. On our other trips, not only did he get us to the places we were interested in, he came into temples with us and explained what we were looking at and explained the culture, which really helped us understand and appreciate what we were visiting. He also recommended a few optional stops that we took advantage of as well! By the way, I have yet to meet another Balinese person with better English skills - he is always clear when he speaks and understands you very easily. His rates were reasonable and the best value for the service you are receiving in Bali. He went above and beyond - he booked our Gili transfers for us and even called the company for us when the shuttle bus pickup was late. Thanks for everything Bedu. You made the start to our Bali honeymoon memorable. If you're ever in Vancouver, I'll take you to our whiskey bar ;). Cheers."

Literally anything we needed was not a problem for Mr Bedu - before getting to our hotel we headed for a quick supermarket shop, and we chatted most of the way home (although Mr Bedu was also sensitive to our long journey and also let us nap in his comfortable car for a little while when the jet lag hit).Along with our airport transfers, we also hired Mr Bedu for a number of day tours in Bali - one to Seminyak, Bali Safari Park, and an Ubud day tour. Mr Bedu always wants you to get the best out of your time in Bali, and suggested an alternative tour to what we had selected, because he wants to share the culture of Bali with you - and we're so glad we took his advice! We went first to the rice terrace, then on to a coffee plantation, a temple, local shopping for wood carving, painting, silver making, and finally a waterfall - and throughout his explanations were fantastic.

HE is super kind, smart, easy to get along with, super professional, and truly one of my favorite people I have ever known. He has always made my stay there really homie, special and easy!"

I had so many questions for him about the Balinese culture that he was happy to answer. He was a great source of information as a leader in his community. He helped me create a perfect day for my children and me to finalize our last full day in Bali. He helped to make sure I didn't miss anything on my list of things to do. He also suggested the Batubulan village to see Barong and Keris dance. This was one of the BEST things we did on our entire trip. It was so entertaining, the costumes were beautiful, the kids loved it! He took us places to learn how the local crafts were created, but in no way were we obligated to purchase anything. However, if you do want to shop, these are reputable people to buy from. He chose a beautiful lunch spot for us (even with buy one get one free mixed drinks for mom ). He drove safely and even helped with my children. He never made me feel rushed or a trouble in any way. He is so kind and friendly, and his car is easy to spot! lol! If he is the only driver you have during your entire time in and around Ubud- you won't regret it! Wish we had had him the whole time! Thanks for a great day Bedu!!"

While we were going round temples we saw other tourists who had just been dumped there by their guide and given no information on the rituals, and other aspects of Balinese life. What a waste of a journey. By contrast Mr Bedu was there to explain things that needed explains but didn't butt in when we didn't need him. We also did not get any sense we were being driven from one \" shopping opportunity\" to another - he took time to find out what we were interested in and took us there.

He's lived in Bali his whole life, but his English is awesome with an Australian accent on the side! Even though it was my first time meeting Bedu, he treated me like I was a long lost friend and he was a pleasant people person! Mr. Bedu was easy to a get a hold of, his response time was very quick, and he was very punctual (or maybe its better to say he's early). Spending a whole day with him goes by very quickly. He knows a lot about Bali , so you just give him your itinerary and he'll make it happen. If you don't know what you want to do, just give him a gist and he'll take you to the best spots in Bali. I was traveling to multiple countries so the original dates I reserved with Mr.Bedu did not work out. He was very flexible with the changes I made; and even though some of the dates didn't work out anymore, he set me up with a reliable friend who was also a driver. During the time his friend drove us, he would call his friend to make sure we were getting the best experience. While communicating with him back in the states, we planned our itinerary together, because it was my first time in Bali. He helped me to group all my activities to see which activities would make the most sense and to maximize my time in Indonesia. He arranged for transport when necessary, he drove us to all the spots we wanted to see (even between transport, he would point out spots to see for a quick look). We did the whole Ubud main spots, and then we did another day of visiting beautiful beaches, he set us up with a beachfront seafood restaurant for sunset where you can ride horses. Lastly, I wanted to cross over to Gili Islands, and he made it possible in the last minute with the shuttle bus back to my hotel and everything! There were many people being turned away despite having purchased tickets from third parties, which makes me believe that he is a reliable source. Side note: Even with third party companies out of his control it seemed like he took the extra step to talk to the right people and make sure I knew what to check/look out for to ensure that we had a good experience with that company or even street vendors! When I return to Bali, I am definitely booking through Bedu Tours again!"

Mr Bedu spoke excellent English and was more than happy to talk us through the cultural meanings of the sights and Balinese life. Mr Bedu was a fun guide who loved to chat and have a laugh with us. He took great shots of us and also gave us some time at each place to explore by ourselves. We had a delicious lunch with a stunning view which mr Bedu recommended us. Thanks for a very fun day, Mr Bedu!"

He picked us up from our hotel, and took us to see a volcano, to the rice fields, on a coffee tour and then to a beautiful temple which he then walked us around explaining the religion. He was extremely nice, and very helpful. I'd recommend his private tours completely as you get the luxury of being driven around in a nice car with a genuine guy who can enlighten you with all the information you need. Im actually coming back to Bali in September and will be using Mr Bedu's services again."

He's always on time, has excellent recommendations and is very knowledgable on all the customs and cultures of Bali. He'll answer anything you want to know, so all his tours are super interesting. I have recomended him to many friends and will use him everytime I visit Bali. He is very fairly priced and makes your holiday simple, easy & fun! Good work Bedu, proud of how far you have come!!"

The drive was just under 2 hours long but talking the entire time I learned a lot about the area and Komang.

One day while touring the island checking out attractions, a traffic incident (no fault of our dear driver) occurred, and despite damage to his beloved car, was able to get a new car and finish the tour!

Batur and the Lake,would say that kids and slightly older can do this,in our their were two people in their 60s one of them wasn't able to cycle so the other one cycled with us,as every group has a van that follows a little behind the cyclists incase you want to stop it meant sh was able to do the tour and stop at each location we stopped at too!"

Had a great time and would highly recommend.The only negative was the time it took to get from Seminyak to the first stop of the tour - over 2.5 hours - sitting in a mini bus, was no fun and then the same after the tour. Very annoying. It wasn't the fault of the tour that one group wasn't ready for pick up and we wasted half an hour waiting for them to get ready. Also not their fault that the traffic around Bali is out of control and quite amazing for early on a Sunday morning!Still enjoyed the actual bike ride and sights."

Starts with a transfer to Mount Batur and an outdoor brekky overlooking the crater lake in the Caldera, fantastic scenery and a great way to fuel up for the day. After this was a trip to a plantation which was really interesting, it had lots of spice trees including coffee, cacao, vanilla, passionfruit, pineapple and lots of others. There was a selection of herb teas/coffees to try (included) and the option to try a cup of luwak (civet) coffee (optional extra).Following this, the bike tour started, it was incredibly relaxing, as it was downhill all the way, except for maybe 3 short stretches that required pedalling. The guide joked beforehand that the most sore part of our body at the end would be our fingers - and he was actually right!The trip was so beautiful as we just cruised through rice paddy scenery; we got to stop at a traditional Balinese house compound; stopped to check a huge spider; and stopped at the huge strangler fig. But mainly it was so good just cruising downhill relaxing and taking it all in, and chatting about Balinese life with our guide (who was absolutely brilliant, really funny and friendly).At the end we dropped off the bikes and they whisked us off for lunch which included about 5 super tasty dishes. I would thoroughly recommend this tour, it is a world away from the crowded beachside areas!"

The villages that we cycled through were beautiful. I would have loved to cycle through them at a slower pace to take it all in. There was a member of the crew that stayed behind with me the entire time so that was great. We also made a stop at Mt Batur prior to our ride. That was a beautiful site to take in.

The pick up was in a rather uncomfortable car, probably because I am tall and my legs didn't have enough space to move. This was a general problem in Bali for me. We stopped at the bat caves first which are located in the temple itself. We unfortunately didn't get to see it up close as there was a ceremony taking place and we were not permitted to enter. The snorkeling was incredible! So many fish and the ship wreck was a sight to see! I definitely want to come back once I have my diving certificate. I struggled to dive that deep with just a snorkel. Our guide Goose was very friendly and had lots of information to share. The palace is out of this world and so beautiful! Goose even bought us some bread to feed the koi! Would definitely do this trip again!"

Breakfast was good, great coffee all included in the price of the tour but the view stole the show. After breakfast we headed down to the coffee plantation in the mini bus, were we were shown how they make the coffee and given samples off all the different types of coffee to taste (personal fav was the coconut coffee). We then headed a bit further down the mountain where we picked up the bikes, fitted helmets and set off. It really is all downhill, think I pedalled on 3 occasions. While on the bikes, we stopped at Edi's (the tour guide we had) family house where he showed the ultimate hospitality, showing us round his house, explaining how a Balinease household works, introducing us to his Mum and Sister. We then set off, stopping at the rice fields, where Edi explained the detail and gave us a chance to take some pics. We then cycled for another 20 mins where the mini bus picked us up and took us to lunch. Great lunch place with a lovely lunch buffet put on.

The guide offers at the beginning to stop any time you see something that you want to take a picture of however that is a bit difficult as sometimes you're riding (coasting) quite fast and to stop to take a pic would mean you'd have to get your whole group to stop.

First stop is a big breakfast (fried noodles, pancakes, fruit, rice, tempeh, chicken etc) with a breathtaking view. Then we went to a coffee plantation and tried different teas and coffee and 4 different types of chocolate. Then we started the cycling tour. Weda, our tour guide was awesome. He spoke great English and was funny and very happy, big smile the whole time. He was also very knowledgeable and we learned a lot about the Hindu culture, the community and the rice paddy fields as he was a former rice farmer. This tour also helps support the community which we love to be part of. We thoroughly enjoyed this tour and would highly recommend it! It wasn't really cycling... Rather just coasting down hill the whole way. But Weda took those who wanted an extra little challenge on a short detour which is was fun. Marley his assistant was also great. Wonderful lunch is also provided and there is lots of vegetarian/vegan options which was good for my wife."

The reps informed us that the journey would take approximately 2 hours, however by the time we got there it was about 3. This wasn't a problem though, as there were some great sights - the only downside being no main road, just uneven country roads. Our cycling instructor (I forget his name!) was absolutely incredible and really made our trip. His knowledge of both the history and culture was deeply impressive. A 20km bike ride in total, we stopped at various temples and a village on the way down. We even had a tour around a family dwelling - a great way to experience their culture and observe what life is like for locals in Ubud. The tour ended at the Elephant Sanctuary, where you could eat lunch (included in the price). The tour is suitable for all ages and all abilities, however bring a jumper with you because it is freezing at the top of the mountain."

For anyone worried it really is all down hill, I think I may have pedalled 4times! Making it suitable for anyone. A good steady pace allowed you to cruise down and take in all the sights. The food at breakfast and lunch was very good, tasty Indonesian food served in beautiful locations that you wouldn't see otherwise. We took one rucksack and left that on the coach while we cycled around as that follows behind and very secure. The bikes were standard mountain bikes, well used but maintained so easy to just jump on one. One of my favourite trips so far!"

            "review": "Amazing experience with a truly wonderful company. My friend and I booked the sunrise Mt Batur trek last minute (7pm the night before). We were staying in Seminyak so our pick up time was 2am. Lucky we managed to get some sleep in the car on the way to the trek. We only had 1 other pick up on the way which made it a lovely small group of 4 plus the guide. We then headed to a restaurant for some coffee/ tea and cake before heading to the foot of the hike.It was still incredibly dark when we started our trek, along with the hordes of other tours. My advise would be to get there as soon as possible and try push yourself to get past the big tour groups of 20 or 30 people. Our guide provided us with torches, however if you have your own then bring it as it's probably a greater light quality or better still get the lights you can wear on your head so you don't have to carry it.The walk up is rocky and unstable in parts. There were always rocks crumbling and rolling around so be careful where you tread, especially in the dark.Whenever I needed a break or anyone else did we would all stop together so no-one was left behind. Once we finally reached the top (approx 3 hours) the view is spectacular! We ate eggs for breakfast that our guide cooked in the volcanic steam, along with some fruit, tea and biscuits.When we were ready we made our way back down the mountain. All of us skidded a little coming down and we had a few bruises and scratches so take it easy.Once finally back at the car our guide informed us that the hot springs (& a 30min food massage) were also included in our ticket along with lunch. The experience was delightful and a wonderful was to finish our long adventurous morning.Overall I had an unforgettable experience and is one of my favourite travel memories. I can't recommend this company and this tour highly enough!!!I will definitely be a returning customer Notes - due to the steepness of the climb, the unpredictability of the rocks and the path not being terribly formed I do NOT recommend this for small children. Additionally there are no bathrooms once you are en route so make sure you use the facilities at the first restaurant stop."

            "review": "Brilliant tour to see a different part of Bali. We almost didn't do this tour due to some TA reviews but I'm so glad we did. The concern was too much time spent on the bus - we stayed in Ubud and it wasn't too much at all. From Kuta/Seminyak I can imagine it's a very long day (our taxi from Seminyak to Ubud when moving resorts took over 2 hours) so if you do it from there, then expect more travelling than cycling. The breakfast venue had a stunning view and the food was tasty too. It was then onto a coffee venue to sample local drinks including the 'poo coffee' (at an extra cost) before reaching the bikes. The cycling is extremely easy - it's pretty much all downhill so the small amount of pedalling was a enjoyable novelty. The pace was easy and three staff meant everyone was well looked after. The bikes aren't brand new and one of us in the group had issues with their gears - my bike was fine. Each bike had some water, if recommend taking extra. The stop at the house was interesting and informative - our guide Wyan was so good at explaining the local cultures, this was probably my favourite part of the day. You also stop for a walk around the rice fields and at a big tree. Stop for lunch was a buffet (so as much as you want) and then back on the minibus to Ubud for a trip to the monkey forest (I think - we were staying in Ubud and had already been so went straight back to our hotel). Only issue was the lack of toilet stops on the way round. Otherwise a brilliant, interesting day and such a good way to see some of the back streets of Bali. Would definitely recommend."

We were picked up from our hotel at 1.15am and due to the location of where we were staying, got stuck in traffic for an hour. We finally got going towards Ubud when the car started to overheat. Going up into the Ubud hills, we hit torrential rain which didn't seem too enticing to start a hike up a volcano. As the rain started to ease, the car completely broke down in the middle of no where. 20mins later we had a new driver, at this point we didnt think we would make sunrise. We got to the meeting point and had missed all the other people on our tour. We then go to the bottom of the mountain to a local trying to sell us jumpers as he said it would be cold up there (don't fool for it). We basically ran up the mountain to make it in time for sunrise. The views were unreal once we got there. You can go to the sunrise point (we couldn't go any further) or you can continue up to the summit. At sunrise point, there are monkeys and steam caves. This is also where you receive a light breakfast (included) and tea/coffee (extra). The hike down was easy, but the terrain is very unstable and steep. We then finished off with the hot springs and lunch which was well worth it. As we ended up with our own personal driver (who wasn't even an employee), we stopped in at the Luwak Coffee Plantation on the way back to Legian. Well worth it, and well worth the experience."

We took two trips with Bali Eco this week.First, we did the Downhill Biking adventure with Weda as our guide. It was a fantastic trip. Beyond the fun of cycling 25 leisurely kilometers through Bali's beautiful countryside, we had several interesting and informative stops: a rice field, a 500-year old banyan tree, a coffee manufacturer, a local family's home and a woodwork shop. Weda couldn't have been a better guide -- he educated us and cared for us throughout the day.The breakfast at Lookout Cafe was so-so and the company is well overdue to purchase new bike helmets, but these are minor complaints from an overall truly fantastic trek.Our second trip, which we just returned from, was the 2am hike up Mount Batur. How was it? Terrible.We were picked up at 2am in a van that smelled heavily of cigarettes. After a bumpy ride that made my wife carsick and another so-so breakfast at Lookout Cafe, we were taken to a parking lot to begin the hike.The walk up the volcano was OK, but the trail was loaded with huge numbers of loud, obnoxious tourists. We needed to ask our guide to slow down a couple times, which he did obligingly. It's not for the faint of heart -- we hike a lot in California, and this trek was somewhat difficult, especially the final leg.The sunrise? Meh. I'm not sure which ruined it more -- the thick cloud cover or the aggressive, loud-mouthed crowds. It was certainly not worth waking up at 2 in the morning for.After the hike came the worst part: a visit to a nearby hot springs for a massage, swim and lunch. Let me say with all caps: DO NOT ADD THIS PACKAGE TO YOUR TOUR.The massage? 15 minutes of untrained women rubbing your feet. (My masseuse accidentally pulled a scab off my ankle.)The hot springs? OK, but the changing rooms are horrific. I changed next to a dirty toilet in a dark closet with no lights.The lunch was the worst part. After eating her chicken and fries, my wife looked down and saw a full-sized maggot on her plate. The waitress screamed when we showed it to her, but did nothing more than apologize. Shortly thereafter, my wife threw up in the parking lot.Go enjoy the bike tour (try to get Weda as your guide), but forget about the volcano, and never ever do the hot springs/massage/lunch combo."

Traffic was heavy but we went to visit a coffee plantation where we saw some interesting plants and saw coffee being roasted and ground by hand. We then proceeded to where we collected our bikes from. All were fitted with bottled water and helmets provided. On out trip was a young girl about 7 or 8 and she did very well with her own bike for most of the trip plus it was a mixed age group as some were over 50! The Eco group have found a great route of 25 kms approx mostly downhill so no big exertion is required which weaves through rice fields and past compounds where the locals live. A few stops along the way enables you to rest from sitting on the bike all the time if you are not used to it (that's me) a guide is always up front and 1 at the rear followed by a van with spare bikes. You do ride along the side of the roads and so get beeped as the scooters and cars go past but once again not too intimidating if you are aware that they are on the road and stay on the side. Bikes were mountain types strong and sturdy with front and rear brakes which I used a lot as you are going downhill to keep a safe distance behind the rider in front of you. So much beautiful countryside and views along the way make it a must do for all that get the opportunity, at completion we then had a late lunch provided which wa another opportunity to chat to other travellers. The staff were extremely helpful, were very good at explaining local things and traditions and taking photos. We were then transported back to our hotels some to UBUD , Sanur and Kuta. We were last and it was around 6 pm when we returned as the traffic through Kuta was heavy"

We were picked up in Seminyak at 7.15, and didn't arrive at the volcano until just before 10... This was a painful start to the day, and coupled with a similarly long journey back, it took a lot of the pleasure of of the day. The traffic was horrendous, certainly not their fault, but the pickups in obscure places in Seminyak really should have been split between two vehicles to make it manageable to time (we were an hour late to breakfast). Also we got the raw deal and had a beaten up old minibus, with aircon that didn't really work and a very uncomfortable ride. I think that most of the vehicles are much newer, so most people will be luckier than us!"

After a few initial communication hiccups between our hotel and the tour company re pick up times and choice of bikes, we headed up to the lookout over Lake Batur for '2nd breakfast.' The view of the lake and volcano is amazing. The bus then takes you to a coffee/fruit plantation which is interesting in that you can see all the tropical fruit and herb plants and taste to teas and coffees. I'm a little uneasy about the caged civets, despite assurances that they are treated well.We picked up the bikes (single MTB with rear seat for Dad and 3yo, solo MTB for Mum and 9yo and a smaller MTB FOR OUR 7yo. The ride is almost entirely downhill and is easy for kids. 7yo got a bit spooked by traffic and descent and had a ride in the bus for a bit, then our guide put her on his bike seat while he stood and pedalled and she enjoyed that. I hadn't ridden with a rear child seat before and it takes a bit of planning to cope with the rear-weighting of the bike when stopping or ascending. The gears on the bike worked OK but were a bit stiff and slow to change, so on a few ascents I felt safer just getting off and pushing the bike. 3yo initially loved it, then went to sleep, so no complaints there! Stops were frequent and interesting, at a Banyan tree, a rice padi, beside the road to play with a HUGE spider and at a traditional Balinese village compound. Lunch was a delicious buffet. It costs us $AUD250 for the day but it really was a full day (8am-3pm) and was good value given meals and water are included."

The guide wasn't very experienced and did not keep a good pace for the three people in the group. We hiked to the top in 70 minutes at a very high pace. He left one of the girls behind on the mountain because she couldn't keep up with the pace and continued with another girl and me. According to the website, there are two guides so that no one has to be left behind. There was no breakfast left so we just had an egg and a cup of coffee (so nothing of the \"Our breakfast is the finest available\" that they advertise on the website). You only get half a liter of water for the trek, so make sure you bring your own food and water. The hot springs were lovely, but just too little time to really enjoy it.

Only a few minutes later the rear brake failed completely, on a busy downhill section with cars and villagers setting up for what looked like a street market. The front brake wasn't nearly enough to stop the bike so I had no option but to ride into a tree and market stall at the side of the road to stop, in order to avoid the traffic. I was very lucky that it didn't happen at a worse time when there was more traffic around.If you go on this tour, and have any concerns about your bike, don't let the staff brush you off - insist on a different bicycle."

We booked two tours from Bali Eco tours, they were the Mt Batur hike and the Eco Cycling Tour.For both the tours, they communicated with us well and included of pick up and drop off.For the Mt Batur hike, we were picked up around 1:30am and were dropped of to Lake View Hotel in Kintamani where we had some cake, fruits, coffee/tea before we began the Hike at around 3:30-4am. We were NOT at all fit people however the guide Kerisna was a saint! He tolerated our lazyness through out the hike which was amazing throughout. The view from the top is amazing and our guide told us about many fascinating stories. After the hike we were taken to a natural hot springs where we got a foot rub, lunch and enjoyed the view of the humongous lake before we were dropped of to our hotel in the afternoon.For the Eco Cycling Tour, we were picked up around 8am and had one of the best breakfasts we\u2019ve had in Bali at Lake View Hotel (which has amazing views of the volcanoes btw) and started our tour by visiting the Eco farms where our guide Gustu showed us Vanilla plants, Bali Cocoa plants to even the Civet where we tried the famous \u2018poop\u2019 coffee or Luwak Coffee. The rest of the tour was cycling. The whole ride was so smooth as it mostly requires going downhill which requires zero effort from us. We saw rice fields, farmers harvesting rice, met a beautiful silk spider, saw old bali houses and gained a lot of information from this tour which we finished off with an amazing lunch before they dropped us back to our hotel.I\u2019d suggest everyone to try Bali Eco Cycle tours for their exploration of Bali. We have so much more to explore which we would probably do next time with Bali Eco Cycling! Thanks again guys for the amazing tours!"

On the first day, we waited over an hour despite emails to the company confirming pickup and location. No one came to collect us. That night, we got emails that felt like lies (as none of the excuses matched from various staff members) as to why the driver didn't come. On the second day, we confirmed pickup again. Despite waiting an hour and being told 7-7:15am pickup, still no driver. Again, rubbish excuses and poor communications. For example, they said their driver advised our villa staff of delays however we have no villa staff. We ended up cancelling after over an hour because our holiday is precious and this company has wasted two of our seven days holiday.If your holiday is short, do not risk booking with this company as they are unreliable and poor at communicating. Very disappointed. So glad we did not pay in advance as I have no confidence we'd ever get our money back."

We took a seat for our 4yr old to double with Dad but they had baby seats on bikes too which would have worked. 25km but all downhill really achievable and there were many stops along the way so it didn't just feel like hard work. Stopping at a coffee/chocolate tasting, traditional Balinese house set up, rice paddies a big Bayan tree and then buffet lunch to finish (but it way about 2pm by the time we got there). The lunch has a magic view over lush paddies and gorgeous trees. The let down from the trip was the buffet breakfast overlooking the crater lake. The view was awesome but the cafe up there was extremely tired, had flies everywhere, dirty bathrooms and very limited food options. We were looking forward to this with the kids but found that the kids hardly ate anything except the pancakes....which sounds great but there was such a queue for the pancakes they only got 1! So if you do this, try to eat before you come and then you can just pick at the food once you get there...but don't expect a feast at all. The lunch also is lacking western food - its YUM - but if you have young kids like us its not easy to find food they will eat.overall excellent day out. they even stopped on the way up to the crater lake to take photos of rice terraces...so accommodating and friendly - good day!"

Friends cried off because they were worried about fitness levels, no need, the ability to sit and brake are the only things needed. Great guides, good mix of people. From the volcano to the family house to the rice fields. Brilliant. Gently flowing down hill on a bike through the rice fields with the kids shouting hello and looking for high fives will be something to remember. Just book it."

            "review": "A great little peak into traditional Bali lifestyle!. What a great way to spend the morning/afternoon! This adventure is suitable for all levels of fitness (since 98% of the bicycle ride is down hill) and takes you on a journey through the traditional Balinese culture.After being picked up at the hotel, the day starts off on a drive to a fairly decent-sized restaurant providing a stunning overlook of Mt. Batur (an active volcano) and it\u2019s similarly named lake. The breakfast is of buffet style, however my wife and I didn\u2019t partake as we had already eaten at our hotel. From some of the other individuals in our group, the breakfast was a bit lacking. Although by the time we arrived at the restaurant, it was almost 10am, so the term \u2018breakfast\u2019 is used loosely. After a half hour of enjoying the view, our guide Dewa (pronounced Day-wa) gathered us up and gave us a little background on the volcano and surrounding area. Once complete, we set out for a quick little drive to a local coffee plantation.If we had read the tour description a little more thoroughly, my wife and I may have limited our coffee intake during breakfast. The plantation had several different varieties of beans and we were given eight small samples of coffee and tea. As a special bonus, we opted to try the \u2018special\u2019 luwak coffee. I don\u2019t want to ruin it for anyone going on the tour, but it was quite tasty and much smoother and not as bitter as regular coffee. With the caffeine raging through our system, we jumped in the van to go to the bicycle pickup location.Now, for an American without a frame of reference to the metric system, 25 kilometers sounds like a far way to bike. You could have told me it would have been 12 parsecs and I would have probably looked at you with the same blank stare. Luckily, my wife runs 5k races and after some quick finger and toe math (along with a handy-dandy Google converter), 15 miles didn\u2019t sound too insurmountable. Luckily, the entire ride to the start point was up hill and the entire bike route (with the exception of no more than 500m <-- see what I did there) was down hill. In fact, there were several places where you could really pick up some speed. However, Dewa kept us in line and at a comfortable pace to take in the scenery.The first stop was at a traditional village. The villages in Bali are comprised of multiple compounds housing sometimes one or more families. Once we stopped, he explained to us the meaning of the placards outside of the compounds (which are used for census purposes) and what the meanings were to the various buildings contained within. Being of Balinese heritage, his knowledge on the subject was very thorough and helped us understand how each of the families contributes to the overall village community.After saying our goodbyes to the residents, we continued on to a 500-year-old Banyan tree. These trees produce very long hanging roots, which will work their way into the ground once reached. A quick photo opportunity with the tree and we were just about to head back to the bikes, when Dewa introduced us to another local resident. I don\u2019t remember the name of the spider produced, but in my head (and perhaps a small outburst) I screamed like a little girl when I saw the size of it. Even though it was not poisonous, I didn\u2019t get too close, other than to snap a few pictures. Other folks, however, were braver than I.Our final stop was at a rice paddy. Dewa took us out into the fields and explained the design and method of cultivation. These fields can be seen throughout the island and their size and yield can be quite extensive. The serenity and beauty of the fields were second to none, especially once separated from the street traffic.A short little ride to the finish was perhaps the only time we had to go up hill, but as previously stated, it was not strenuous. The bicycles provided were not top quality, however given the frequency of use, I wouldn\u2019t have expected them to be. A quick shift through the gears for the few gradual climbs and we were at our pickup spot. From there, we were driven to another restaurant with a scenic garden view for a late lunch. Even though the trek was mostly down hill, we were ready to eat, and the food did not disappoint. It was of buffet style, however the options were traditional Balinese plates. Luckily, there were plenty of choices for my vegetarian wife.Our tasty meal lasted about half an hour and we were rounded up again for the drive to our individual hotels. Both my wife and I had a great time on this trip and would highly recommend it to anyone visiting the island in the future. Dewa was the perfect guide and we had such a great time listening to his jokes and narratives of each of the stops. Anyone can take a walk through downtown Ubud, but getting to know more about the local culture was a great little adventure not often experienced. Thank you for this opportunity Bali Eco Cycling!"

The breakfast there was nice but not a neccesity, I'd rather bike a bit more. We visit a coffe/spice house, a balinese village family house (really good) and rode down through villages and paddies. Only thing to notice were the many groups of cyclist doing the same route making it a bit touristy. But what can I say: I'm one of them! It won't be long before the Balinese start making pictures of us."

I had pre-booked this adventure for our family of 4 while staying in Ubud. It started with a van ride up the volcano to have a tasty breakfast buffet and fuel up for the downhill ride. We were a bit disappointed we didn't get to actually ride down the volcano, but that was probably for the best. Our guides rode in front and back to keep us together and avoid the sometimes hairy traffic on the narrow roads. The scenery was beautiful and we got to learn a lot about Balinese life, working in rice fields, living in family compounds, and even the death and burial process. The ride ended with a tasty Balinese lunch at a local restaurant outside of Ubud. The traffic can be horrendous and luckily we were able to hop out and walk back to our Airbnb, so make sure you budget extra time!"

Then to a very good breakfast with an absolutely stunning view of the lake. Then to a coffee plantation where we also saw herbs and spices growing: aloe Vera, cinnamon, cardio on, coffee, cacao, lemongrass etc. we sampled a great range of coffee and chocolate. Then onto the bikes for a great tour of the local area. We learned how rice is harvested, and saw inside a family housing area. Very basic by western standards. Finished with a delicious lunch - ate far too much in the day!! Cycling is very easy, you don't need any fitness as all downhill. Our guide Weda was very good, although not entirely sure his comments were all true."

The Mount Batur trek was an early start (we were picked up at 1am) and requires a decent level of fitness but it was absolutely worth it. We made it to the summit in time for sunrise, were provided with coffee and a simple breakfast at the top (banana sandwiches and boiled eggs) and were treated to an amazing view. There were a lot of people at the top but there is still plenty of room to watch the sunrise and take photos, and everyone disperses relatively quickly once the sun has risen. The track up and down is relatively challenging, steep and quite rocky, a few people took some minor tumbles but even so, we all had a great time.The cycling tour was also excellent. It was all down hill so suitable for all fitness levels with some great stops along the way (kopi luwak coffee, traditional compound, rice fields). This was a great tour and a really fun day out.We would definitely recommend this company. The tours are easy to book online, they are very punctual, the guides were great and the tours were excellent value for money."

Both breakfast and lunch were delicious buffets (breakfast was at a restaurant overlooking the caldera of Batur - a spectacular view). The biking itself was very relaxed to say the least - I don't think I pedalled for the first few hours of the trip. There is an optional 6km uphill climb at the end though for people who want a bit more of a workout and almost all of our group elected to do it. We were picked up at our hotel in Canggu at 8am and returned back at 5pm so it was a full day excursion and all in all, great value for the money.

We did not see \"the typical local warungs where you can find the best local cuisine, the shortcuts to the scenic rice-fields, how to find the shortcut through the Ubud market, and the local's access around the Monkey Forest to the lovely village of Nyuh Kuning.\" We did, however, visit a home (the guide's own home) where he showed us a cacao tree, and his family's pigs and temple. We saw a temple with a banyan tree but just from the outside parking lot. We did cycle through rice paddies and stopped to take pictures in the paddies and along some of the back roads. The guide seemed to be mostly on auto-pilot. He stopped to explain a few things (though not many), wasn't particularly open to questions from us and didn't notice when one of us fell and skinned a knee on a rough patch of rice paddy path. We all stopped to help her as he went on. He came back to find us when he noticed we were gone, but didn't check to see what the problem was - just kept going and only offered a bandaid an hour or so later after we'd paid. You pay at the offices where they offer the use of a bathroom that is out back and dirty. Altogether a mixed bag of a tour which was more biking than tour.The massage, however, was a complete delight. Really beautiful setting, responsive, expert practitioners. We would definitely make an appointment to go back to that spa (Heart spa) any time."

This is a great experience if you want to get to see the other side of Bali, go to local compound and get a little taste of everything that Ubud has to offer. Reason for not giving them \"Excellent\" is because I think the tour could have been better. First I think they should have specified that we don't actually go to the Tegallalang Rice Terraces - the bus only stopped there as a pit stop for a picture on the way to our starting point. The other rice fields they showed us were very small and private. Again nice tour but I expected to see more from the description on their site. The bikes were also worn down but that's understandable because you are going down hill using the brake most of the way, and be prepared to be on moderately busy road with cars. It is still safe but something worth considering if you don't feel comfortable with it or you have small children."

We also bought abput 40 school books pencils erasers and rulers from a local shop and handed them out to village kids as we went through, it only cost us $20 but we were advised it was extremely appreciated and gave is opportunity to connect with the beautiful balinese people, a small thank you for allowing us the privelege of riding through their pretty home villages. Honestly, if you are wondering whether or not to book PLEASE JUST BOOK IT, YOU WILL LOVE IT!!!"

Just visited Bali in the last couple of weeks, and my daughter Janine (before we left Aust.) recommended this cycling company called ECO TOURS, so we got in touch with them and went on one of their tours which took us up to Ubud to ride down the mountain, sight seeing and visiting different venues along the way. Our tour guides name was Eddy. He and the whole experience was wonderful, learning a lot about the Balinese culture along the way. We stopped at two places along the way, one for breakfast, and one for lunch, which was also fabulous. We couldn`t recommend it highly enough. This was after just about dragging my niece and granddaughter out of bed, not wanting to do it, but found out how enjoyable it was. 081337420420 Bali number."

Our two children (7yrs and 9yrs) absolutely loved it and learnt so much. Our guide, Dewa, was really friendly and patiently answered my 7yr olds endless questions which is no easy task! The tour was perfectly timed and the scenery we experienced along the cycle was amazing!!! My daughter is not a confident cyclist and nor am I really but it was all downhill, the bikes are good and we both loved it. Another family who traveled with us has a young child and he was able to go on a kids bike seat at the back of his dad which he loved. The visit to the local house (or compound as they call it) was very eye opening and great for the kids to experience away from iPads and 5* hotels. The breakfast and lunch were good, nice selections of Balinese foods and enough to satisfy my fussy daughter who has a tendency for white foods only! We left home at 7am and returned at 5pm and the whole day cost us only $140USD plus a bit extra for drinks at lunch and a tip for the driver and guide. I would say the trip was great value for money for a full day out and I would highly recommend it to families."

It was quite a long day being bused around to all the tourist traps like the buffet breakfast and the coffee tourist farm. We kind of wished there had been just a straight downhill cycling tour without all the stuff before hand. The driver took a wrong turn on the way home and we were driving forever so we weren't home till 5pm and we were staying just north of Ubud!The tour itself was great but the bikes have crappy breaks and they did not explain that people should use the right brake only, otherwise you'll go over the handlebars! Which is exactly what happened to two ladies in front of us. They both needed medical attention and were fainting as they tried to get back into the bus following behind. I was glad our toddler had decided to sleep in the car at that point because if he'd been on my bike then I may not have been able to stop in time like I did!I would not recommend this tour for anyone who isn't familiar with riding a bike on a road. There definitely are hazards like car doors and motor bikes and cars the whole way. Also the last part of the tour is actually uphill and quite hard with loose rocks over the road. I walked some of the way because I couldn't ride up these parts. And this is NOT including the optional uphill segment that they advertise, this is the \"downhill tour\"!The Balinese lunch at the end was fabulous but cold by the time we got there to eat it.The guides were really lovely people and did a great job, but the tour needs better bikes, some bike training about safety and an option to start the tour straight say without having the buffet breakfast (which was not great) and seeing the coffee farm (just a tourist trap)."

Getting a chance to mountainbike mostly downhill for 25km through small alleys and rice fields; areas non tourist would pass gives you a true feeling and insight into the Balinese culture. Starting at a coffe plantation, having breakfast with a breathtaking view of Lake and Mt Batur, seeing a Balinese compound and ending the day with a nice buff\u00e9 is just perfect. We had one guide and an assistant in our small group so we could cycle in our own tempo. The bus was right behind us through the trip so if anyone wanted to rest he/she could jump on the bus. Nevertheless, cycling itself can be a bit risky for families with young children as most streets are filled with scooters. Loved how the locals and especially the children cheered us everytime we passed. If you love cycling, coffee, food and of course want to get a closer view at Balinese culture give this a chance!"

I went into the tour thinking there would be more biking, but in reality there isn't much exercise, you ride in the van, eat a breakfast buffet up on the mountain overlooking the lake (very pretty and good food), visit a touristy coffee plantation setup and learn about native flora), bike slowly downhill making many stops, and then eat lunch at a good restaurant in the jungle. What this tour is awesome at is getting you backroads Bali to see life outside of the tourist areas, the visit to the family homestead in the countryside was eye opening, this is the typical standard of living in Bali, you stop at a rice paddy and see rice harvesting in action and can get involved if you like, and stop at a 500 yr old banyan tree. The village people are very friendly and love to wave hello and interact. Myself and several others on the tour were looking for more exercise so did the optional uphill 6km portion at the end- this definitely made us sweat and earn our lunch. It would be nice if the tour company offered a standalone advanced bike tour with more real biking for in shape people (our tour had small children which definitely couldn't have done the extra uphill part). Overall a great value for the money, definitely recommend for families!"

The tour advertised breakfast and lunch and both were very poor quality, food was greasy and not very spicy. I ordered a supposedly fresh coconut juice at lunch and it came in a coconut shell that i think was used in the Castaway movie, the juice in the shell did not come from that coconut. I did not drink it. It was fun to ride down the hill but there were too many stops and the guides sexist humour became tiresome after a while. I would recommend to people who do not often ride a bike but if you do ride then you may find it better to do another ride."

The plantation kept some luwak cats too. The plantation staff provided a range of tea and coffee tasting session and explained the benefits for each of the teas. Tip: can buy the teas and coffees, what u buy is what u taste. The chocolate bars which they also sell was not as good. We had breakfast at the scenic restaurant overlooking mt batu and the lake. The mangosteen was awesome if the restaurant provides during season. We had breakfast at our hotel so did not take the tour breakfast thus can't comment much abt the food.The cycling tour begins ard 10plus. It's downhill most of the time and there were stops during intervals so it's great for those who are not exactly fit. But having said that besides the stops, we can't really enjoy the scenery during the cycling cos we had to lookout for portholes, people and traffic. During the tour the guide showed us a family house and introduced us to Balinese cultures and their way of life which was very enriching and eye opening. We ended the tour with a fabulous lunch and the satisfaction of a good exercise. Overall experience was good. Would recommend to anyone who wants to have a closer experience to Balinese culture."

As an avid photographer, we got to ride at a pace which took the slow nature of photography into account. Our guide Weda was fantastically informative and having very quickly realised that i had a passion for the Ogoh Ogoh's dotted around the landscape, he moved to the back of the line with me and took the time to explained all about them. I highly recommend Weda as we got to see his family's spiritual household of which he explained all the intricacies of family life for generations in Ubud. 5 stars, fully catered, all we could eat, gentle riding, informative, fantastic guides, great way to spend the day culminating in a cold Bintang!

We started the day with a quick stop off outside Ubud to look at a rice terrace and followed through with a very substantial and tasty breakfast of banana pancakes, bubur injin and other delicious food, over looking Mt Batur. A quick visit at a coffee plantation and then onto collecting our bikes and helmets for the ride. We rode mostly down hill through little villages. I essentially rode the whole way with very little pedalling and limited braking power (make sure your brakes work before you leave). We stopped at a family compound and were able to see how the Balinese live, we explored little villages on the way and met some children, had a look at how they harvest and process the rice and package it. Ketut Joe was magnificent at explaining everything along the way. We had a 20 minute stop for morning tea of fresh bananas and water.After the ride, cold towelettes and water was supplied. A short bus trip and we had a magnificent lunch. Then a 40 minute bus ride back to our hotel. My only criticism of the tour was that the bikes weren't in the best condition and that the shared helmets did not look safe. As the bike tour is mostly down hill people of limited fitness would be able to take part in this very worthwhile experience."

Although the sites were beautiful and the cycling tour was educational, unfortunately I felt that the tour was very rushed and I did not get to enjoy the bike tour. Here's a breakdown of the day:-The guide and bus driver were 30 minutes late picking up our group, and we were the first to be picked up out of the entire group.-We spent close to 1 hour waiting for and looking for a no show group, cutting into our tour time. This was frustrating given that the rest of the group (close to 10 people) showed up on time, and we were waiting around for a no show guest up to 1 hour. 15 minutes? OK. 1 hour? Not OK.-Once we finally got on the road, we were stuck in a lot of traffic to Ubud.-Because we were already 1 + hour behind due to waiting around for the no show guest, the entire bike tour was rushed. We were speed cycling like Tour De Bali, and did not get to stop to take photos or enjoy the sites that we saw.-There were too many sites to see. Instead of stopping at the rice fields, coffee plantation, traditional Balinese home, and the spiritual tree, it would make sense to cut back on the number of sites so that bikers can slow down and enjoy the cycling.-There was another group from the same company that lost their tour guide who sped ahead, so they had to join our already large group to get to the end of the biking tour.I recommend researching other cycling and biking tours, and suggest that Bali Eco Cycling tour manages their time (such as no show guests) better."

The bikes are in reasonable condition. Obviously well maintained for the amount of riding they see. The ride itself is lovely and very easy. It's 98% downhill unless you choose otherwise, I'll come to that shortly. You don't need to be worried about riding on the roads. The tour is on country roads with very little traffic unlike most of Bali. The downhill ride (~26km) itself is broken up by 3 stops. The first is a traditional house. By house I mean a set of building each with their own function. It was very interesting learning about the Balinese way of life. The next stop was a rice field, and once again this stop was great, learned a lot. The third stop was at a old Banyan tree. In my book a tree is a tree unless it extremely impressive but this wasn't. The true reason for this stop is to have a banana and split the group up into those who want the do a ~6km ride uphill and those who don't. I personally chose the uphill section. Up until this point the riding had been very easy. The uphill section is not. I would recommend that you are a regular bike rider to attempt this section. To highlight this, up until this point I hadn't touched my bottle of provided water. Whereas, I had smashed through it about one third of the way of the uphill section. We had 3 quick stops on the uphill section to regroup and rest.The rest of the time the pace is on and the heat can be oppressive. By the end you are drenched in sweat and it's fantastic. The van arrives not long after you finish with everyone else on board. The bikes are just left behind to be collected. I must mention that during the ride they have at least one guide leading and one in the rear, so there is no chance of getting left behind. In fact I dropped a chain and was quickly on my way with a bike swap. The uphill section only has one guide but those who can't make it are picked up by the van. The final stop is lunch. Once again a buffet, and again the food is good. This tour involves a lot of travel in the van at least 120km return from Seminyak, and remember that in Bali traffic moves a lot slower than elsewhere. So it's a very full day. I would highly recommend this tour. It's great for riders of all abilities and the uphill section is great for regular riders who want a bit of a challenge at the end. Great way to see Balinese life and vistas."

            "review": "What a day of fun!. We were originally going to book a three hour walking tour with another company and came across this at the last minute so decided to try as it ticked off the terraced paddy fields, the volcano and Kintamani as well as seeing the real Bali.We were picked up a few minutes late but considering we were staying in Seminyak and knowing the traffic, I don't think any company can be harshly criticised for this. We were also the last pick up making our group a total of nine.Yes the trip to breakfast at Kintamani is long especially if coming from Seminyak but the view from the aircon comfort was great and of course we stopped at the lookout for the paddu fields where everyone it seems takes photos.Nothing wrong with the breakfast and the stunning view from the Lookout Restaurant of Lake Batur and the volcano. We were even above the clouds but the view was amazing.The only negative for us was the visit to the coffee plantation which clearly was not and those who chose to pay for the Luwak coffee should be disappointed as this was so much of a rip off compared to what we experienced at Uluwatu.Then we went to choose our bikes. This was fun and we did realise that there are other groups who were doing this at staggered times and we really didn't get in each others' way. On the bike and down the road and all the stops were memorable. It was amazing to visit the compound and have a huge spider plucked from its web to crawl on us if we wished. You bet we did.The banyan tree and the paddy fields where the women were threshing the rice was a very memorable experience. The ride finished on a couple of little steep climbs which made several of us struggle so made the end of the ride and the cool towel very welcome.Lunch at the restaurant at the end of the cycle tour was okay and frankly I was disappointed with the food but it was okay by Balinese standards. The Bintang was icy cold and was definitely worth it after being in the sun on a bicycle."

We heard about Bali Eco cycle on tripadvisor and we able to take advantage of their early bird discount to get the trip for 35USD(quite expensive by baliense standards so I had high expectations)First the pros Countryside- scenery was absolutely spectacular from lake batur to the rice fields and more coconut groves, unfortunately there was some trash littering places that ruined the beauty of it, but that's reality everywhere I guessRoad- nice quiet road with hardly any traffic. Kids at the roadside waved and said hello etc.Very easy cycle-all downhill, we were holding on the brakes 95% of the time, unfortunately there was no free-wheeling. In total we spent less than 2hours cycling only.Spice and coffee plantation-if you've ever done a spice tour before then by comparison this is super basic and the plantation is really only an allotment sized plot to demonstrate the various varieties, not s functioning plantation by any search of the imagination. It was a nice opportunity to taste the cafe luwak.Family/rice fields-nice to see but whistle stop photo opportunities only really.ConsUnpunctual-advertised time of collection was 7.30, but they contacted our hotel the day before to say it would 8.00-8.15. They didn't arrive til 9am, over an hour late but no explanation or apologyBus-unfortunately the aircon wasnt up to standard so the time we got off the bus, we were drowsy and soaked throughTime on bus-we were staying in ubud centre and expected it would only be a short ride to get to the location, but it was over an hour. In total, we probably spent 2 of the 7hours on the bus. Unfortunately our guide didn't use this time to give any sort of commentary about what we were passing or even ask us how we were finding the tour.Guide-great English but not very engaging or interactive, seemed like he was reciting facts he had been told to learn off. Any questions were given brief replies. Given our previous experience of the people here this was probably the biggest let down.Number of tours-small thing but while the group size was small(10), there were three other groups doing the same tour, while the start times were staggered it did feel like it was one group on top of another.Breakfast-as other reviews have stated, better to eat before you go. Food is cold, small portions. Fortunately lunch was better Bike-small thing again but be aware that all the bikes are male bikes(high crossbar) and seats not well padded.Overall, would not do it again and would not recommend it to a friend at40USD(the standard price)"

Our absolutely hilarious and knowledgeable guide was Agus who did a great job of getting us from point to point. Very easy ride, beautiful scenery and it was great to see aspects of Bali that someone wouldn't come across on the usual tourist paths. Given that the tour was very enjoyable, I learned many things that I had not learnt on previous visits to Bali, that the tour included two meals, two guides, hotel pick up, good bikes and payment to the families who own the homes and fields we visited, the tour is worth 40US.

            "review": "Very mixed feelings.. I have mixed feelings about this tour. I did the cycling/education tour with my partner and our guide was Henry. Firstly the good:1. The view from the Lookout cafe in Kintimani where you have breakfast is absolutely breathtaking and well worth the journey if only for that.2. The ride itself was beautiful. Very easy and as everyone has already said, almost all downhill! I hadn't ridden a bike in over 10 years and picked it up within a few minutes and was on my way. 3. The visit to the rice paddies, the compound and the banyan tree were great. Henry was knowledgable about these areas and happy to answer any questions we had. The not so good:1. The breakfast itself was cold, dry and a little stale tasting, but this could be because it sat out for a while, I'm not sure. Make sure you pack some snacks if you're at all a picky eater. 2. The website for the tour advertised a max of 8-10 pax per tour, this was one of the major reasons we booked this tour. We had 14 people on our tour, 9 of which came from the same group and definitely acted as if the entire tour revolved around their group. It was also too many people for our guide to keep task focused.3. The tour was very rushed. This may have been due to the aforementioned group taking a long time to do everything, but it felt as if we were in and out of each location before we could breathe it in. eg. we stopped at the terraced rice paddies for no more than 5 minutes (a quick photo opportunity that felt very forced). 4. If you don't like tourist-trap-like tours, this probably isn't for you. Parts of it felt authentic but I mostly felt like I was getting shuttled from location to location to see \"real Bali\". All-in-all it was a fun day. I probably wouldn't recommend it to my friends as I don't think it was worth $40USD pp. I would, however, recommend the tour company for other programs as the day ran fairly smoothly and it seemed like they had it pretty well together."

The cycling is a comfortable downhill cycle for about 22km through villages and rice fields. Our guide Wayan (might be spelt wrongly) was awesome and so informative. We felt safe throughout the trip as there was 2 guides, one in the front and one at the rear of the group. They picked us up very punctually at 7am sharp at our hotel. The view from our breakfast place was so spectacular - Mt Batur and Lake Batur. Lunch was delicious as well. We like this trip as we really got to see and experience the local lifestyle and culture which is what we appreciated the most. The whole tour was relaxing and easy. My husband and I enjoyed this tour so much, definitely the highlight of our trip."

Hopped on out mountain bikes and pedaled (mostly coasted!) down through rural Bali seeing stunning rice fields, beautiful chicken barns (really!), small villages, learning about rice farming (and the influence of non GMO) and stopping to see a traditional family compound that makes woven bamboo matts. Finished at a beautiful resturaunt with a fabulous lunch. Our guide, Weda was so enthusiastic and turns out he is actually a rice farmer.

It is an early pickup from the hotel and a couple of hours until you get to the mountain, sorry, the active volcano for brekkie, so we had a light brekkie to see us (the kids!) through. I believe our guide was Wayan, he was excellent, helpful and very caring.The bikes were perfectly sized for us (3 adults, 2 teenagers and 1x 9yo child), helmets were provided if you wanted to wear one. What a beautiful way to see the countryside of Bali, 18km of gentle downhill cruising/pedalling along quiet roads, with only 2 small hills to pedal up. Stopping at sites along the way really gives you a chance to enjoy and appreciate Bali. There is an optional uphill ride after the main ride has finished, but none in our family did it. The food provided at brunch and late lunch was delicious, all the staff very welcoming and friendly.I would highly recommend this as a way to see Bali without the crowds, traffic and crazy heat. Nothing like a breeze to cool you as you ride!"

It did that and MORE. It stopped and went inside 2 homes. Fascinating to learn about the Bali Hindu family traditions such as the common naming of the first 4 children, and the filing of the teeth.Our tour guide Iggy (sp?) was funny and entertaining, and maybe the most informative of any guide on our trip. Somehow he understood that the differences in our cultures is what we found most interesting. Before we had breakfast, we stopped at a coffee plantation and found out the fascinating way Luwak coffee is created. We also got to try samples of 10 or so different types of tea and coffee for the additional cost of one cup of coffee (about $4 US).Then we stopped at a Lakeside restaurant at Kintamani and had a very nice Balinese buffet breakfast. This is included in the tour price, along with lunch and pickup at our hotel. After breakfast, we drove 5 or 10 minutes to the lot where we picked up our bikes.I suggest bringing a bottle of water, although one is already on the bike. Then, in addition to stopping and walking inside a couple family home compounds, we stopped at a gigantic, beautiful Banyan tree, and also a rice paddy, where they explained some of that farming process.Through all of this there is plenty of time for pictures. It is virtually all down hill, and we may have spent as much or more time at the various stops as we did on the bike.Finally, we stopped at what seemed to be the Bali Eco Cycling Restaurant for lunch. Got to try several new fruits, and they had a very good selection of Balinese dishes for lunch. We got a better price by paying for this tour online in advance ( before we left to go on the trip).Very highly recommend this tour. A super educational experience! ! So much more than a bike ride !"

Breathtaking views of Mt. Batur and Lake Batur, delicious breakfast and lunch (one of the best meals I've tried in Bali!), nice cycle through the countryside, friendly and knowledgeable tour guides...I couldn't ask for anything more, but it was so much more than just that! The best way to express how much I enjoyed my day is to say that I would gladly go on this tour again! Please also know that if you decide to go on this trip and opt for the 7.5km cycle up the hill, but you're not in the shape of your life, your tour guides will help you make it to the finish line, like they did for me! :)"

A run down dilapidated non air condition van with no headrests and broken seats collected us from our villa in Seminyak. The driver was non English speaking. On our way to Ubud the driver collided with a bike rider in the traffic hitting the female passenger, OMG what a way to start the day. Our tour guide Goose didn't board the van until we reached Ubud. The cycling tour was great, guide Goose was very informative, modern equipment & meals provided were adequate. This experience was ruined by having to endure transport in a substandard van. It was so hot in the vehicle that the only means of ventilation was the half opening, screeching Windows that required extreme force to open and that's if they did open. Eco tours really did themselves an injustice subletting out the tour to another transportation company."

Firstly it is awesome value for money; 40US for breakfast, delicious lunch, great guide, bikes, visit to a Balinese home and transport through beautiful parts of Bali. The ride is easy; all down hill, not too steep, so little peddling but an extra 5km uphill ride for those who want a challenge. A great, great day out!"

Communication before the trip was excellent and - by planning ahead - we were able to have \"Beny\" our tour guide for the entire experience. Beny was on time every day, a joy to spend time with, and amazingly attentive and helpful with our daughter. Beny made Bali for us with his honest stories, curious way, and constant support. Without his help she would not have completed the hike up - or down - on the volcano. We went snorkeling, stayed in Bali Eco recommended places, and rafted and cycled. Each day was amazing. As with all great adventures you have to accept a few snags but nothing we encountered is worth mentioning except that for those looking for \"exercise\" although the cycling is a fun activity it is truly all downhill so no pedaling really necessary."

You also get to try Luwak coffee, see the terraced rice fields and have breakfast at the volcano on the way to the start. You get to see how local people really live and the best side of Bali. The ride is downhill using your breaks more than your pedals. Lunch at the end was delicious and one of the best local styles you will get in Bali. I always find the trip is a little different and this time we had lunch at a different location but the food was just as good. And the price is affordable for all."

We were collected from our villa in Canggu at 7:30am by our wonderful guide Weda and driver Puta. I would recommend a light snack before you go as it is a bit of a drive up to the starting point in Kintamani. Weda showed us all of the points of interest along the way and was more than happy to answer our many questions about Balinese culture. We stopped off for photos at a beautiful lookout before arriving at a lovely restaurant overlooking Mount Batur and Lake Batur, where we were offered a welcome drink and enjoyed a delicious breakfast overlooking the gorgeous view. Next stop was down the road at a coffee plantation where we were given an informative tour of the plantation. Our guide Weda, who is also a rice farmer, really knew his stuff and it was so interesting to see and smell the origins of so many familiar plants. He also explained the process of making the coffee, including Kopi Luwak. We were then offered samples of all of the various coffees to try which everyone, including my children, found really fun. After purchasing some of our favourite coffees (and chocolates!) we set off for the start of our bicycle tour. We were all allowed to choose our bikes and helmets and given bottles of water before Weda explained a few simple safety instructions. The ride was pretty much all downhill and through lovely villages and countryside. We stopped along the way to visit a real family compound and experience what traditional Balinese lifestyle is like. Weda also took us to some rice fields and explained how the rice is grown and harvested and some of us even took turns threshing the rice! We finished up the day in Ubud at another lovely restaurant for lunch overlooking another gorgeous view before we were delivered, with all of our luggage, to our next hotel in Ubud. The tour included pick up from our hotel, breakfast, coffee samples (8 cups!), a light snack, lunch, water and transferring luggage for 8 people to our new hotel only cost an extra $20 in total. Weda's local knowledge alone was priceless and it was a day that we will remember forever!"

Just bring jacket, wear grippy shoes and all should be fine. Understand that there's many routes to the summit. Hence, ask the guide which you're taking based on your level of competence i guess.We had banana sandwich, fruits and eggs while waiting for the sunrise. Beautiful scenic view overlooking Mount Abang.The last few meters is the most challenging as there's loose volcanic rocks. Saw many slipped but i had it easy as my guide was there to hold my hand or else i would slipping most of the time as well. They are really fit and helpful.After that, we went to hot spring (water is lukewarm tho quite disappointing) and lunch. Overall, enjoyed my very first trekking experience. It's not easy but it's always worth it. Give it a try but also be mentally and physically prepared for it."

Ketut (aka Joe) was our guide whose enthusiasm & passion to share his Balinese knowledge was openly genuine.The rice terrace visit is breathtaking, the coffee/tea tasting awesome, however my personal highlight was the tour of a Balinese compound. The wealth of knowledge that Ketut shared enrichened my whole experience and perspective of Balinese life. I learnt more from Ketut in 3 hours than what I had in the week previous. The more strenuous ride through the rice fields (optional) was a dream ending to my Bali experience for the day. A tip though - take small change with you as you may want to give the beautiful people you meet that day a few dollars who so warmly open their homes and working fields. None of these people asked for any money at all neither did they try to sell you anything. What an awesome day. Thank you to all who made this happen."

We had a great day - lots of fish to see and loved the Water Temple one the way back especially (you can swim in the only cold water in bali!) but can only give the trip three stars due to the snorkelling being marred by quite a lot of rubbish in the water. Apparently the villages near Ahmed chuck their rubbish in the river which then runs into the sea and along the beach...so if you're snorkelling, you can end up doing so among a whole lot of plastic bags. It kind of came in waves, so I sat and read a magazine I'd luckily brought for an hour (my partner just ignored it so snorkelled on regardless and just didn't look sideways!) on the very lovely beach. Then it cleared up and so you could get back out there, with lots of tropical fish to see and a wreck- clear water and decent visibility. Reef is largely dead unfortunately. Lunch was on the beach (rocky beach so bring thongs) and was very tasty. Tour guide was great. But perhaps a better way to experience would be diving (as you'd be below any passing rubbish) or heading out in a boat beyond the currents along the shore - and here's hoping over time some rubbish traps are installed."

The people and tour guides were amazing, nice, and funny. I suggest giving this a go for some good exercise. If you have an average physical fitness, you should be okay but tired by the end.

Now to be fair my husband and I only got two and a half hours of sleep before the 2:15am pickup time so this may have had something to do with the utter exhaustion we experienced on the way up. Once you get to the top though? Wow. Our guides(Wayan, from Bali Eco and Soma was our local guide, both were just wonderful) made us a breakfast of boiled eggs and banana sandwiches, some fresh fruit and chocolate bars. We sipped on hot tea while they cooked the meal watching the sunrise begin. It was truly spectacular and so worth the hike, the clouds covering the lake the stars still sparkling while the sun painted the sky. As if the view wasn't enough when you finish your driven across the street to hot springs, your muscles thank you. They thank you again when you return to the Bali Eco restaurant where you receive an amazing foot and calf rub(also some really yummy peanuts, like the best peanuts I've ever had).

Our guide, Agus, started off by a short introduction about who he was and the origin of his name and Indonesian names in general. It was a nice touch. We first stopped at a restaurant up on the hill, where we had breakfast with a stunning view on mount and lake Batur. Nice selection of food, which gave us some proper energy for the bike ride ahead. The second stop was at a local coffee brewer, where we had a coffee and tea tasting. We were also able to try the coffee Luak. We didn't think it was that special, but it is nice to try. After this, we got on our mountain bikes. They provide a helmet (not so common for us Dutchies :) ) and a bottle of water. Agus was in front of the group and two assistants followed the group, to make sure the group would stay together. It was 25 km downhill and some parts were a bit more steep, so it felt very safe to have them at the back of the group. When it rained they also provided rain coats. During the bike ride we had several stops, one at a local house - where Agus explained the housing situation from an Indonesian family - and one at the rice fields. It was my dream to stand in the middle of a rice field, so he made time for us so we could help out the local rice farmers. Yes, you're a bit muddy after that, but it was such a fun experience. Last stop was for lunch. We got the option to take the bus or to ride up the hill ourselves (approximately 45 min), but we were all a bit tired and wet from the rain, so we chose the bus, which took just 5 minutes. There was a buffet with a wide range of local food and it was al so, so good. Staff was also very lovey and professional. Absolute must do when you are in Ubud!"

He and his colleagues were very patient and took the time to explain everything, and knew a lot about the local culture, economy, and sustainability. We hike is strenuous but manageable for someone who's in good shape, the view is incredible, and the trip down is slippery but the guides are great at helping you in both directions if you're struggling. We had snacks, coffee, etc. before going up and at the top, then we went for a swim at an incredible hot springs at the base of Mt. Batur. We also had a very foot massage and a delicious Indonesian lunch at the head office, where we spoke to the owner of the place. BEC is Balinese-owned, hires exclusively local staff from the village, and cares about sustainability and about Bali (they recycle, use only coconut oil, and are active in advocacy around environmental sustainability on the island). We were so happy to support them and our day with them has been one of our more memorable in Bali. Highly recommended!"

I am not a fit person in any shape or form so I was worried about not being able to complete this but I found this very easy as it was all downhill. Joe (Our tour guide) was super friendly and enthusiastic and it was a great experience. Definitely one of the highlights of my trip. The only thing to be aware of is the pathway in the rice paddies is a little bit narrow and it is easy to fall off the path and get a bit scratched up but aside from that I had a great time. The food at the end of the trip was very tasty and was a great finish to the end of the day."

My partner and I had been looking for an active adventure as well as cultural tour, and this is definitely the one! The whole day cost us $40 USD each plus a couple of other small expenses. We were picked up from our hotel in Legian around 7:15AM and made a couple of other pick ups around Legian, Seminyak and then Ubud. There was a total of 8 of us on the tour. We were driven to Kintamani where we had a good buffet breakfast overlooking Mt and Lake Batur and were given some information about the volcano. After this we were driven to a Luwak coffee plantation where we learnt about the coffee process and got to taste a number of teas and coffees and had the opportunity to taste Luwak coffee for 50,000 IDR for one cup (its the most expensive coffee in the world so that is a reasonable price). We were able to buy packets of any tea/coffee we sampled if desired. From here we were taken to the bikes where we rode for approximately three hours mostly downhill through the 'real Bali'. We stopped off at a and learnt about the traditional Balinese home, and a rice field and learnt about the process. We rode through villages where children and families would say hello to us. It wasn't as easy as they make it out to be - were very sweaty and tired at the end but well worth it. There were two guides, one leading and one at the back to keep the group together. There was a bus following us in case anyone needed to be driven anywhere. At the end we were taken to the Bali Eco Tours base and had a great buffet lunch where the only extra cost was any drinks we wanted to purchase for 15,000-35,000 IDR. We were then driven back to our hotel and arrived about 5:30PM - was a long day for us as we were the first to be picked up and last dropped off. Was an incredible day of education, exercise, and an amazing cultural experience. Couldn't recommend this company more highly."

Collected from our accommodation in an airconditioned mini-bus, with our guide Eggy and reassuringly careful driver Sugi, and 5 other happy pedallers we paused to view stunning rice terraces then drove up to the Lakeview Eco Lodge at Kintamani. There we had an excellent breakfast while taking in the awesome panoramic views of the volcano Mt Batur, its lava flows curling down to a huge lake. We then drove 5 minutes down a quiet back road to a coffee plantation, where we saw coffee (fragrant white flowers!), cacao, pineapple, guava, pepper, vanilla and many other fruits and spices growing, and sampled their own freshly roasted coffee. Another 5 minutes\u2019 drive to visit the village home of a friendly Balinese family, an instant and revealing introduction to the daily life and culture of an ordinary Balinese farming family. We then collected our well-maintained bicycles and helmets, and began an easy 25-kilometer ride, downhill all the way, to Pejeng village near Ubud. The road was a quiet backroad, we felt very safe as we glided along through villages, past farmers working in market gardens and ricefields. More fascinating stops, for a walk in the ricefields and then at a village to see an huge old banyan tree (said by locals to be 500 years old). Then more pedalling, until we reached our destination. Most us then opted for the optional extra 8km pedalling, with some (mildly) more challenging uphill sections. We then had an excellent lunch in a shady gazebo, Balinese food and juices, voted delicious by all. Thank you Bali Eco Cycling, we hope we will take many other tours with you!"

At the latter, we saw various plants such as cocoa, coffee, vanilla, and cinnamon trees. We got to sample different herbal teas, coffees and cocoa drinks that were all delicious.The bike ride was mostly downhill, so it was fairly easy.

The emails about pickup time were handy so you were not left waiting. Breakfast was fantastic and in an amazing location. The bikes were in good condition and came with a water bottle. The ride was easy and varied, it just did not go for long enough. There were stops along the way in which the guide explained things. Highly recommend this tour.As this was so well organised we decided to book onto one on of their other tours, snorkelling the ship wrecks off the east coast of Bali. I would not recommend this tour and would suggest to the company that it is worth removing it from their program. The drive is long (we knew that, but enjoy looking at the countryside) however the air-conditioning barely worked in the bus, there was only one window, it got so hot and uncomfortable for all passengers. I felt like passing out and I am a good traveller. The snorkelling spot was very average. You snorkelled amongst rubbish and a slimly film on the top layer of the water. There were lots of fish and some coral, its not spectacular. The snorkelling gear was rubbish. Some were broken, it was well used and most of the snorkels had mould growing in them, which is what you breath in. The snorkel gear is not maintained or cleaned. The bathroom facilities were disgusting, broken and not cleaned. The water palace and bat cave were interesting side trips on the way back. The option of swimming at the palace should be included."

I wanted to give an \"excellent\" rating, however, Bali Eco Cycling lacks the most basic thing in their tour: a first aid kit and standard emergency protocol.I had an accident during the tour, which was okay (I still finished it riding the van). But just wanted to note the following:1) There was no first aid kit. Given the nature of the activity, one would assume that this is a standard. Good thing one of the people in my tour had one, and he was the one who cleaned my wound and bandaged me up.2) They did not offer to bring me to a clinic during, or even after the tour.I incurred a lot of expenses (including x-ray), and as advised by my hosts, I contacted Bali Eco to refund my medical expenses as this should be covered by their insurance policy. To make a long story short, I was refunded by Bali Eco after several emails, which was good.I eventually found out that the guide did not inform their office about my accident. I understand that my case may be isolated, but nonetheless, Bali Eco should prioritize the safety of their customers and ensure that all their staff are well-equipped and act professionally."

The bike tour is well organised and the equipment is quite good, but there were a couple of spoilers - the breakfast was pretty average which maybe fine except a number of our group started getting cramps and nausea a couple of hours after the breakfast and by the next day most of us were unwell. The other spoiler was their attitude to payment. The tour is priced in USD and they set the conversion rate which you have to pay in IDR - which was higher than any bank or money exchange rate of the day and thus inflated the cost for 10 people. When I questioned their rate and asked them to use a more reasonable rate that was in line with their website rate, the money changers or the daily bank rate they refused. I had some USD on a credit card but I wasn't able to pay in USD either - it had to be in IDR on their conversion rate. I wanted to keep enough cash to tip our guide and driver (who were fantastic) and as I hadn't anticipated this exchange rate I decided to pay on credit card in order to leave enough to cash for tips. They charged me a further 2% for using the card. It just left a bad taste after what was otherwise a good day. The kids enjoyed it - the ride is safe, fun and easy. The scenery is Nic and the lunch at the end is good too. The stop to visit a Hindu family compound is interesting - but feels a bit uncomfortable and intrusive. If you do use this company I suggest you skip the breakfast and ask them to confirm the exchange rate or IDR price ahead of time."

First of all the staff members were really kind and professional - I felt safe while in the mini-bus which had seatbelts and was well maintained and appreciated being greeted and introduced upon pick-up at my accommodation. The tour was really good value - they provided good equipment - bikes with helmets and a bottle of water and gave us a banana on our break halfway through the cycle. The only part I didn't appreciate about the tour is the agritourism stop at the plantation. Bali Eco Cycling is really great and affiliating with that company cheapens your image, in my opinion. The coffee products aren't that great and vegan clients don't appreciate seeing caged civets. Upside of that was that we didn't feel pressured into purchasing the products which is good. The visit to the Balinese compound was interesting, and although I felt bad for intruding it was good to know that this business is giving back to the local community by paying the village for visiting the compound. More explanation about the use of brakes and changing bike gears would have been appreciated, as well as warning just before the end of the ride where there was the small creek.That being said, there was a staff member leading the tour as well as one at the end of the pack so that no one is left behind. I felt well looked after. Their restaurant where we had lunch was absolutely delicious and they had lots of vegetarian and vegan options served in a buffet style. Would definitely recommend it!"

The stops were all relevant, though as someone who is reasonably fit, I did find the downhill cycle felt a bit monotonous - so it was great that at the end of the 20km downhill cycle there is an optional 5-6km ride on a slight incline up to their restaurant, which I was all up for and was actually more enjoyable than the 20km downhill.The breakfast stop was lovely, offering an incredible view of Mt Batur and the crater lake - though, being vegetarian, the only food options available were fresh fruit (which was more than adequate for me) and black rice pudding. Similarly, there were a few vegetarian options (ie. non-meat) for lunch, though staff were unable to tell me exactly what was in each dish (ie. sauces) so - though they may not have been meat - the options might still not be suitable for those with very specific dietary requirements (ie. vegan / raw). Minor gripes though. A wonderful, unique experience."

The sunrise at the top is worth it. We also had the package with the Hot Springs, Foot Massage and Lunch at Eco Bali Tours included. This makes the tour! It is totally worth the money and the food is the best we had in Bali. We loved it! Agus was our guide and entertained us with his singing of American rock songs!"

Our guide Edi and our driver were great and every day was action packed with some very early starts. Highlights were dolphins in Lovina, hot springs and the sunrise walk to Mt Batur and finally the lovely cycling tour itself. All meals and sightseeing were included in the price and we stayed in some lovely hotels and B&Bs. Food was delicious but do check what is allowed for meals though as there are limits. I would definitely use Bali Eco again on a future visit."

First we drove to a spot to taste test coffee and tea and we got to see the animals that make kopi luwak. Then we drove to a buffet for breakfast that had the perfect view of the Batur volcano. BEAUTIFUL. From there we drove to a location and got our bikes and helmets. It's 27 kilometers (15.5 miles) downhill. There are 2 or 3 small hills but not bad. We stopped a few places along the way and our guide taught us about the Balinese people. At the end of the tour we parked our bikes and had lunch, then they drove us back to our hotels.This was an incredible experience and I look forward to doing it next time we come to Ubud!"

We were picked up straight from our villa and driven to the breakfast location which overlooked a volcano- beautiful view! After that we got to do a little bit of coffee and chocolate tasting (where we got to try Luwak coffee for a small extra fee). The bike ride itself was heaps of fun and mostly downhill, so very enjoyable and easy. The Bali countryside was green and lush, and we had fun waving to the locals as we rode past. We got to visit a traditional Balinese house, which is something you'd never get to do on your own. We chose to do the optional extra 5km uphill ride and it started pouring down rain! But the guides were more than happy to join us on the rainy ride. The tour ended with lunch that they prepared for us which was hearty and prepared locally and sustainably. Amazing experience - couldn't get any better!"

We confirmed the booking for the tour only the evening before the trip due to concerns about the weather, but the arrangement the following day was still impeccable. For the cycling part, it was mostly downhill and thus not too taxing for the average cyclist. Along the way, we stopped to visit a local's home, tried out local snacks, tried our hand at harvesting rice etc, and it was really a good experience. Most adventurous and physically fit cyclists could try the 6km uphill option provided towards the end of the tour, just before lunch."

A good start to a hot sticky Ubud day I say! We we're then taken to breakfast with the most amazing views of and great food.From Mt Batur we headed down in the bus to a Kopi Luwak coffee house where they process and roast the coffee beans. You also get to try a large selection of the amazing teas they mask there as well.... some absolutely awesome brews.We then headed over to start our mountain bike trek. The ride is approximately 25kms and is pretty smooth riding all the way. Nice cruisey down hill side on tar roads through local villages and rice fields. We stopped off a few times to see some local attraction. I would rate the ride XE (extremely easy) the bus also tags along so if you do need to rest you can hop on the bus.The final stop before heading home was to another pretty awesome lunch. The food on this trip is really good.All in all a really good experience to take. If your looking for a hardcore mountain bike adventure... this one isn't is. Its more suited to a leisurely stroll on a mountain bike l;looking at awesome scenery! Enjoy!!"

There was so much incorporated into the day, that you don't expect when you book a cycling tour. We visited got to try different teas and coffees, learn more about Balinese living and culture, and see a tree of life while on various stops of the cycling route, which is beautiful. Our guide, Punk, was thoroughly entertaining, he really made the day memorable. The tour is organised well, you are picked up on time, taken for breakfast, and given bikes that are in great condition. The route is very easy, which is great, all you do is balance and enjoy the surroundings. You are on proper roads at some points in the course, though, so you ride alongside cars and other vehicles, and the space can be tight. At the end of the day you are taken for a very tasty lunch, and finally dropped back to your hotel. It is such a fantastic day and one you really shouldn't miss when you are in Bali."

Both tours were great fun although I found the cycling tour to be a lot more informative. It took approximately 2 hours to reach the top of Mount Batur after starting our ascent, the views from the summit were incredible and it was definitely worth the sweat drenching journey. Breakfast of banana sandwiches and chocolate bars were offered upon reaching the summit. Although I did not eat anything I heard from others in my group that the food was yummy and well needed after exerting so much energy to reach the top. We got to see the monkeys that live on the volcano as well as one of the 3 craters which was an incredible experience. After our descent back down the volcano we were taken to the hot springs. This was slightly disappointing since I had assumed they were the natural hot springs of the volcano. Instead we were taken to a hotel type resort that comprised of a pool area and a smaller \"hot springs\" area that was indeed filled with very warm water. Nonetheless I had a great day.The cycling tour was my favourite tour by far. Our guide Cadek (Goose) was lovely and so informative! I think I found out more about Mount Batur from him than I did on the actual sunrise trek! We were taken to a coffee plantation which, for me, was the highlight of the tour. We tasted a variety of balinese teas and coffees and I even opted to try the world's most expensive coffee that is made from the excrement of an animal. The people on my tour also made it a great one, we all had such fun!I would definitely recommend Bali Eco Tours, I had a brilliant time with them. If you're lucky enough to get Cadek as your guide you will not be left disappointed!Thank you Bali Eco Tours!!!"

Next stop was Breakfast which had breathtaking views of both the volcano and the lake. The food was pretty ordinary however - was free so we could t complain to much.On the third stop we picked up the bikes. The track is 95% downhill and pretty fun. We stopped at various points including a rice field, a 500 year old tree and we popped in to see a local family putting together a feast for the upcoming festival. Was a great insight to see how the locals live.We had lunch around 2pm and the food was fantastic! Probably the best Balinese good we had in Bali.The only downside of this trip was the breakfast however our the experience our guide Joe provided more than made up for it!!Great value for money and an unforgettable experience."

Dewar was excellent and was able to answer every question we threw at him about the mountain, the temples, the villages - all of it. He was also extremely supportive during the climb - when I was struggling towards the top he was with me every step of the way.This tour seems to take a different route down the volcano to other companies, so after a breakfast of eggs and bananas cooked in the steam of the volcano we headed to another lookout to see the local monkeys.The hot springs afterwards were amazing - a beautiful lookout over the lake and Mt Agung, and an hour of relaxing in the pool was exactly what our bodies needed after the climb! This tour's not the cheapest, but it's worth the money - great service, great guide, and a great day out."

From the pick-up at our hotel, to the trailing vans as you wind your way through tiny mountain hamlets, and the finishing lunch, Bali Eco Cycling (with their blue shirts) know what they are doing and clearly take great pride in their product. We also found the educational aspects of the tour such as a visit to a local family compound and and agro-tourism site to learn about the various spices, fruits, and famous Luwak coffee to be well put together.It was a great all day outing from Jimbaran in the south - be prepared for an early morning start (6:30 AM) and a return at approximately 3:30 PM to the southern hotels. You will be fed breakfast (so-so) and lunch (delicious - other raters weren't lying, it really is that good). Be prepared to pay extra for freshly blended fruit drinks at the end of the ride (extra was about $5) but otherwise, everything is included in the cost. We could have paid the whole thing via PayPal versus just the deposit (it is not a transportation fee - somehow we thought it was and brought more dollars with us than we needed to).There are toilet facilities at the breakfast location where the view is the only selling attraction. The toilets at Eco Bicycling's restaurant are very clean and well maintained."

Got up around 1:30 am and left ubud around 2 got fed a small snack before starting up the mountain. An easy climb up for the first half the second half will get your heart going. Well worth the effort when we got to the top had some nice breakfast and a sunrise. After some walking around at the crater and checking out some monkeys we made our way back down. Great view when it's light out."

Brilliant guide Joe - funny and informative - and who gave us so much insight into the Balinese way of life. Easy ride downhill on good bikes with the option of using the van (following) if you needed. As others have said, you can ride uphill at the end if you want to push yourself. I chose not to and simply went the rest of the way (no hills) to a delicious lunch - very clean facilities and great food. As many others have said, this was a highlight of our trip. I think it would be a great family day out - they have tandem bikes if you need them."

I did the cycling tour and can highly recommend it especially if you like 'tour' with a small 't', that is no boring and tedious narrations, no high pressure visits to merchandising outlets or staged cultural performances. The group was small & friendly (making it a good choice for female solo traveller), bus and equipment good quality. The pick up was punctual. Lunch was also fantastic.It was really well organised. I'm not the most confident rider but there was always another guide at the back to encourage me and help me keep up. It is all downhill and only goes on quiet roads and rice paddies.Jo, our guide was great, didn't talk too much but was full of fascinating information delivered in a cheerful easy manner. He had a good rapport with the locals which meant we could feel comfortable going into households and work areas to see more of local Balinese life without feeling like an intruder.Well done ecocycling and Jo!"

We had coffee and cake at the lake view restaurant before driving down to our start point at 0400. Now there are many different reviews on here about how hard the trek is, I for one found it very easy going to nearly the top and where you are given the option to go on to the summit. Don't get me wrong it is steep from about half way up with a few places of scree and large steps to negotiate and I have done a lot of trekking in my life time, if you wheeze walking to the shops this is not the trek for you. If not give it a go.Now the extra few hundred meters to the summit are hard, it is all scree and loose stone. The view from the top is beautiful, but don't think you will be the only one up there. Once sunrise was over we were came back down the the first stopping area to have a bit of breakfast. Banana sandwich and boiled eggs cooked in the volcanic steam, after which we toured the area being shown the echoing crater, temple and monkeys. It was then a trip back the way we came to the bus.The bus then took us to the hot springs, this a an hour of my life that I'm never going to get back. If you think that the springs are going to be the angelic natural waters that you have in you mind, think again, it is set up as a few swimming pools that are in dire need of a clean. We just sat next to them and had a drink waiting for the time to arrive that we could leave. It was then back to the lake view restaurant for brunch, this was very nice and plenty to go around. The views are great and you can see where you have walked. The tour guides were great, always waiting for the slowest person to ensure we all made it up to the first stop point, and pushing the fitter of the group to the summit. They are knowledgeable and fun to walk with. I do wonder who writes some of these reviews saying they were on hands and knees, they are super fit and found it hard. Don't be put off by these people, as even half way up you come out of the forest you will still have a wonderful sunrise view, so give it a go."

After coffee it was time to start biking. The bikes all seemed well maintained and safe. You stop several times along the way to learn about the local culture and to have a drink or a snack.

It was one of the best activities of our trip, mainly because our tour guide was so friendly and hilarious. The tour included a trip to one of the Luwak coffee plantations (a popular addition to most tours we found), a cycling tour through the local villages followed by a delicious lunch by one of the rice fields. Our tour guide, Eggy (so sorry if that's spelled wrong!) was absolutely amazing. He really wanted everyone to have a fun trip. The cycling tour was beautiful and all downhill for those that are nervous about the difficulty level. We literally never had to pedal. There was an optional uphill portion at the end of the tour for those that felt they needed some exercise. If you didn't want to brave through the humidity, you could continue downhill to the van that took you to the final lunch location. I highly recommend this company for a cycling tour in Ubud."

I found Bali Eco Cycling when I was planning for the trip, but was not successful in trying to sign up for a tour as my inquiry through their web site was left unanswered. However, the night before the trip, we asked the concierge at our hotel to book us on a cycling tour, and they happened to connect us with Bali Eco Cycling anyway. So it worked out.We were picked up from our hotel in the morning and went for a drive to Kintamani for a breakfast buffet at a restaurant with panoramic view of Mount Batur. There was good selection of food for breakfast, both local and western dishes. Since we already had breakfast at our hotel before leaving, we didn't eat as much, but the view from terrace was very nice.After breakfast we went to a coffee plantation where we could do some tasting (including optionally the famous kopi luwak). It was educational especially as we were shown some local plants and the spices that are produced in the area. But it does have a little bit of 'tourist trap' feel as they hope that you would purchase some of their products (and we did).After this stop, we went on the actual bike ride, which was a good distance but it was all downhill, so it's doable even for some young guests in the group. Our guide Gusto was very friendly and engaging. There were a couple other Bali Eco Cycling staff riding behind the group, and our bus also followed the group, so everyone felt safe and didn't have to worry about getting left behind or not having assistance in case there is trouble during the ride.At the end of the bike ride, we went to Bali Eco Cycling's restaurant for a lunch buffet. The food was good, and it was a good way to end a nice morning of touring the rural area of Bali. Overall we enjoyed the experience, and would recommend it to anyone interested in sightseeing the rural Bali at pretty leisurely pace."

They were about 20 mins late picking us up but to be fair traffic can be a nightmare and they had pre warned us about this. The tour guide joe was hilarious, his language abilities are incredible and he has extensive knowledge and interesting information to share about the temples, and the flora which you will see on the tour. He also taught us a lot about Balinese culture whilst chatting in the car which was a bonus. The only disappointment on the tour is that the website describes eating fresh fish by the side of the lake with the villagers, however due to attempts to conserve the area the whole village has been removed (!) so this is no longer part of the tour. They should update the website to reflect this.I will definitely be re booking with this company to do the volcano and bike tours when I return to Bali."

Our guide, Joe was very knowledgeable and taught us many things about Balinese culture along the way."

I was picked up in Sanur at 7.30 and made the journey up to Kintamani, travelling through Ubud. This is the worst bit, but Bali traffic is Bali traffic, not much you can do about that. Got out to the lake overlooking Mt Batur at around 10am, very impressive views there, where they serve breakfast. Breakfast was just average. From there off to get the bikes. Bikes were in good nick and it's easy riding, pretty much down hill all the way. We visited a local Balinese house and learned a bit about culture and everyday living, stopped at the Oka Agrobusiness to try teas, chocolate and Luwak Coffee (50k IDR) and learned about how it all gets made. Also stopped in a rice field and had a short trek through the field, which was great. At the end end there was an optional uphill ride, which I really enjoyed. We then finished off with lunch which was very good. Our guide Hendri was very informative, shared lots of personal experience and was also very funny. A good day out at very good value 560k IDR or $40 USD. I'd recommend you take a sports bottle, they do provide water, but an old sports bottle makes it easy to take sips as you ride, rather than having a plastic bottle in the bottle cage."

The only downfall of the tour, (which by no means is the tour operators fault) is the amount of time spent in the mini bus in traffic getting to and from the bike start/finish, seemed to spend as much time or more on the bus than on the bikes.

We had a great guide - 'Eggy' - who was great and made the experience even more enjoyable. They serve breakfast and lunch - it's a buffet. Both are great, however, for me personally I do not need that much food. We didn't get up for breakfast until 9:30am so we had eaten anyway before we left Ubud. That said, you definitely would not go hungry. You get to see an balinese home, cycle along the rice field and through charming rural villas with kids and dogs and loads of scooters, coffee tasting, and some rice harvesting. The best part: experience the sounds and smells of Bali from a bike."

It was quite a drive to our start point at the volcano (which was a bit of a surprise) but so worth it when we got there. We visited a family home in a village, the Luwak Coffee place, rice fields and cycled through the real Bali. It was about 25 kms but don't be put off, its pretty much all down hill so you hardly need to pedal. Our guide was awesome and we finished at a stunning place for a late lunch - awesome. I got my best photos of my whole two week holiday on this trip. The bikes were great (helmets optional) and we rode with a group of about 10. Awesome trip!!"

First, it offers one of the lowest price I could find, and it's open for single travelers! (Most tours in bali are private tours, and only run for more than two participants, or single travelers would need a 50%more surcharge)Second, like the food, hot spring, and the experience itself were beyond my expectations. Abundant food offered at hilltop, and the lunch afterwards at the a restaurant overseeing the mountain was awesome! The hot spring was nice, and you could wash yourself up after the long hike. The guide was friendly and helpful, and I met quite some great new friends too! Definitely the scenery of sunrise was amazing!"

We were picked up from our hotel in Legian and driven to have breakfast nearby an active volcano with a stunning view over the lake. We were then taken to our bikes. There were 12 people on our tour. The staff were all very helpful and spoke good English. Bike was very comfortable with safety helmet if u wanted one. The bike ride was 25km but nearly all downhill so not strenuous. We stopped off in a Balinese village where our guide told us all about Balinese culture, very informative. Rode through paddy fields and stopped at a banyan tree where those wanting a more energetic ride could go uphill for the last leg. We chose not too and met the others for a very tasty lunch. Met some great people on this trip and cannot recommend it enough. We are not cyclists back home but this did not matter in the least. Go on this tour, you will learn a lot about how the Balinese live and see some beautiful scenery. Well done guys"

This is a wonderful way to see the villages and rice paddies on good quality well maintained bikes and enhanced by the amusing and informative guide Joe/Ketut together with supportive and helpful assistant guide Wayan and professional and courteous driver Ketut. Booking, pickup in comfortable air conditioned van, clear orientation and cultural insights added to my confidence that I had chosen well. And it was a pure delight to swoop along the quiet country roads and to slow down and observe and photograph the temples and shrines and rice paddies. We got involved in harvesting rice and it didn't feel too intrusive: smiles and jokes and high fives were exchanged along the way. I was fortunate to have been part of a random assortment of clients all of whom were at a similar level of comfort on their bikes. Recommended."

My friends and I took part in a sunrise trek, where we were driven to Mt Batur and walked up in time for the sunrise...which was beautiful although if you live in a country with beautiful sunrises and mountains already it wasn't really that great. What really lead to the 'terrible' review was the service we received. We paid $50US and were lead to believe throught the website that we would be receiving a tour and food that would justify the cost. We didn't. We barely saw our guide, didn't receive any information about the volcano or the village. Literally nothing. When ewe got to the top we didn't get hot drinks as promised, had nowhere to sit and were given packaged food despite this being an 'eco' tour.The hot pools afterwards were nice and the local guides that take you up the mountain were great however the whole experience was really unprofessional.For lunch we got an omelette which would have been about $2NZ at a Warung.On the return drive back to Seminyak the guide got out at his home and told the driver to receive our payment, which put the driver in a terrible position as we were not happy to pay the full amount and couldn't negotiate with him.We then found out you can actually walk up Mt Batur without a guide...for free.My advice-do your homework before signing up and negotiate the cost. (everyone on our tour had been told a different amount)"

We had the 4 year olds on child seats and the 6 year old attached to the back of two adult bikes - and everyone had a great time. We must have cycled about 15 km but it was all a gentle downhill gradient. A couple of nice stops to take in some sights along the way and learn about Balinese villages, and great to spend some time in the countryside. A great way to get some exercise and see a bit of the island on a simple day trip."

He had a story (and a joke) for everything, gave us great insights into Balinese life and even taught us some Balinese. Breakfast was looking out over Mt Batur - stunning on a clear day (we were lucky), the stop at a Kopi Luwak farm was surprisingly interesting, and the bike ride itself was a blast. Pretty sure I know how rice paddies work now too. You could pretty much complete the 25k ride without pedaling once. If you can balance on a bike, you can do this tour. Bikes are nice and new, hardly any traffic on the roads and it's a really nice ride through little villages. The lunch at the end was delicious - buffet version of food you'd find at most warungs.

They answered all our questions very friendly and very fast. So we booked the Jungle Trek for 4 persons.Pick-up was more than punctual at the place where we stayed. The driver and the guide were very kind and very helpful. During the drive, we made a short \"toilet-break\" at a gas station and since there was not so much traffic, we reached the starting point of the trek very fast.There we were given water bottles and we met our local guide. He and our guide accompanied us during the trek. The local guide explained us some of the plants of the jungle and we had a wonderful and easy walk across the quiet and untouched nature. The atmosphere in the jungle was absolutely wonderful. We took a lot of pictures and our kid (10 years) was enjoying the walk and having fun with the guides.During the walk in the jungle, we also visited a very interesting temple with Hindu and Chinese elements. For reaching the temple, we had to walk uphill for a few minutes but this, too was not too exhausting. At the temple, we drank water and ate some snacks, both provided by our guides. After the temple, we headed for a lake which we crossed in canoes carved out of trees. After a few minutes more walking across the jungle vegetation, we reached the starting point where our driver was waiting. There we changed clothes and hopped into the car for heading to our lunch place.The lunch was in a restaurant in Bedugul. It's a place for tourists but the food was quite good and since there was a buffet, you could choose from a lot of different dishes. We especially liked the fish sat\u00e9 and the fish curry. There was fried rice, plain rice and fried noodles. In addition to that, there were also vegetables, tofu and temp\u00e9 and soup. For desserts, we found delicious fried bananas with vanilla sauce and cake. We liked the buffet and also our kid enjoyed it very much. Just be aware that the drinks are not included in the buffet and you have to pay them extra. But that was not a big deal.After lunch, we also visited a local market in Bedugul, where you can find a vast choice of fruits, clothes and balinese souvenirs. After this, the guides brought us back to our hotel.Perhaps just a small hint for the jungle walk: We did it in the dry season, so the paths very a bit dusty because they were covered with sand but I don't want to know how slippery this can be if there was rain.Summing up, we had a wonderful day which we all enjoyed very much. From the first contact via email to the moment we bid farewell to our driver and guide after the drop off, this was a very positive experience and we can highly recommend Bali Eco Cycling. It sure was not the last time that we used their services."

We only booked the day before after a recommendation from a friend.Fantastic view of Mt Batur, and what an amazing experience cycling downhill through the villages. There is no better way to see the real Bali than visiting the villages, the padi fields and become immersed in the culture. We enjoyed it very much, it was a unique tour and highly recommended for everyone.We were slightly worried if our son (8 yrs old) could make the 25km trip, but it was no problem at all. The guides split up and one of them stayed with us the whole way, making sure that the traffic was safe and we enjoyed the ride. My big thanks and compliments to the guides, Edi and his friends. I'm sure that you will get more bookings as my son raved about his adventure at school :)"

            "review": "A fun way to experience a bit of Bali.. The tour started from the moment we got into the bus collecting our group. Our guide Win was brilliant informing us of some of the Balinese culture and explaining the plan for the day. Started with a drive up to breakfast overlooking Mt Batur and Lake Batur. Food was local and lovely. Then moved on to a coffee/spice plantation. This was the only part of the tour that felt a little forced, we were given 8 different drinks to taste and then able to have a look around. Unlike most \"tours\" we have done in european destinations there was never a feel of us having to buy anything extra. Then the cycling started, the bikes were well maintained and the brakes superb. From then on its a completely downhill 15-20km cycle. Stopping off at a balinese compound, sacred tree, rice paddies. Even an impromptu stop to find a giant orb spider! Felt completely safe and the lunch at the end was probably the best meal I ate in Bali the whole 2 weeks we were there!"

Everything was arranged quickly, with a slight increase in price as effectively a 'private tour' however this was then reduced due to another late booking. So 5 of us was still really a private tour!! The whole day went like clockwork, with a lovely lunch overlooking Batur and well guided trip down the hills and through the rice fields, where we even got to plant some!!Our guide, 'Tour', was very informative, engaging and sensitive to everyone, and even a puncture was swiftly sorted by arrival of back up truck.Well recommended."

I booked the day before and there was place for us. We had a small group of 12 people of all different age groups. We were picked up punctually at our hotel and driven for breakfast, then it was onto a coffee plantation. We had an interesting coffee and tea tasting and very informative talk. We choose our bicycles and started bicycling 25 kilometers downhill. We stopped enough and had a lot of water. At the end of the downhill part we got to choose if we wanted to cycle uphill for a more strenuous ride. We choose to do that for some exercise. We were hungry for lunch afterwards. The food was amazing and had enough variety. The drinks were above average priced. All in all it was very good value for money and we would recommend it to everyone."

They picked us up from our residence and after an hour or so driving, we were taken to the Lakeview Restaurant in Kintamani for a relaxed smorgasbord breakfast. Then we went started our cycle down the mountain back to Ubud where the company also owned a very nice restaurant were we had a fabulous smorgasbord Indonesian lunch with soft drinks included. The ride was easy, the bikes in good condition and modern (with good breaks and gears!). Anyone can do this ride. You do not need to be fit. Most of it was downhill and free wheeling. We say local villages, rice paddies, and toured around a local living compound. Our guide was fun, with excellent english, and good general knowledge of the area and customs. It was well worth the money and was a load of fun."

We saw a variety of Balinese cultures and traditions and it was all a really easy ride.Although it sounds far at first the majority of the route is downhill and it is essentially sitting on a bike and rolling rather than riding. It is great fun and a must do!The optional 5km uphill is tough at the end. I consider myself quite fit and I was very tired with legs a little bit like jelly afterwards (I did win the race though)"

We booked 2 different tours with Bali Eco - bike tour and Ash and Lava Trek.From first e-mail communication was really good and fast, we prebooked the tours and paid 10 us$ deposit pr person pr trip.Was picked up on time for our bike trip, the drive to the top was good, and the view fantastic. Breakfast was really good (buffet), so no need to eat before the trip. Stop at Luwak plantation - ok. Then it was time for the actual bike ride. Bikes were ready (as was the child seat for our 4 year old. Helmets was destributed, we tested the bikes (good), and off we went. The first 25 km is down hill, and really everyone can do it! The secenry is magnificent, pure bliss to ride through the rice fields - stopping at a local house, rice field and banyan tree. I skipped the last 5 km up the hill, but husband and son did it, and had a great time. Lunch was so tasty and good - some of the best food we had in Bali. Only thing that let this trip down a bit was our guide, he had a funny accent, and was hard to understand - I overheard some of the other guides speaking with other guests, and just whished we had one of them, since their English was perfect.The Ash and Lava trek, was different. Due to traffic the guide was late picking us up (afternoon pickup). First stop was again the top, with view over mt. Batur and the Lake - still fantastic. Then we waited, and waited, and waited .... Had a cup of coffee, but really, we just wanted to go trekking ... Finally our guide came back, and we head off. Driver was driving crazy (to try to make up time?). Arrive a the starting point, get some water bottles and start trekking. No explanations what so ever! Just guide in front and us trying to follow. It's quite a hard and long trek, walking in ash with tiny sharp lava stones in it (don't try this in sandals!!). By sun set we were nearly at the point, the guide pointed out as our stop. 20 min later we arrive there. Guide gets out some eggs, wrap them in grass and put them inside a hole, where the steam is coming out. Then he makes room, so we can try to touch or feel the heat coming from inside the vulcano (Still no explanation).We all sit down on the rocks, guide takes out the picnic he brought for us - really good food, and packed in banana leaves - also the eggs are done, so we can have thoose too. Very special feeling sitting in the dusk/dark on the rim of the crater eating picnic.After picnic it's dark, our guide brought 2 flash lights (we are 5 in total), and we start the decend. Not as hard as getting up, but it's very steep, so almost happy we're walking in the dark.Upon return we were tired and expected the driver to be waiting for us, but he was nowhere to be seen, so we waited quite some time for him. The drive back to Ubud was scary to say the least .... Very aggresive driver. But we made it home in one piece, and after all it felt awsome to have been at the rim of the vulcano crater."

We had a large group of 25 who are not hugely early risers so it was very noteworthy that the Bali Eco tour group were very flexible in arranging a tour that would fit with our group. Some people were a little skeptical about the 2 hr ride to our starting destination however at the end of the event we were all thrilled with the day. We stopped at a coffee plantation which was a lovely experience, headed for lunch at Mt Kintimani where the service was fantastic for our large crew. It RAINED like I've never seen rain while we had lunch but even in the rain it was beautiful! We were lucky it subsided and we cycled downhill through the local area high fiving many of the little kids along the road. The visit to a local home was also incredibly rewarding as the kids were so interactive with us, trying on sunglasses and making faces etc. Rice paddy fields made for great photos toward the end of our trek. We were tired and satisfied during our drive back to Seminyak. Great day and every one of our clients voted this cycle day the best day of our 5 day event. Side notes: The guides were very entertaining and spoke great English. They were accommodating on the long drive when we needed pit stops. Absolutely would recommend this day for families with a little older kids (the roads can be a little intimidating for an inexperienced cyclist) as well as large groups. Just be aware of the lengthy drive in the heat and ask if vehicles have working air conditioning."

I was picked up promptly from my accommodation and within 20mins, our little bus was full and we were on our way. The first drive is for a good couple of hours before breakfast, so if you need to eat before 9.30-10am, it's best to take a snack with you. Breakfast provided was a wonderful, complete buffet and a great way to fuel up before the ride. Our cycle group ranged from babies in baby seats to adults and the tour is designed for all. I felt completely safe and the bikes were just fine. I froze a bottle of water the night before and carried this in my backpack. (The Bottled water provided warmed very quickly on the cycle)My stay in Bali was only 6 days and this tour was a compact introduction into Balinese culture, compound living, rice paddies and their volcanos.

From the communication through to transport, food and the bikes themselves nothing has been over looked!! You start the day have a beautiful buffet breakfast overlooking the largest volcanic lake in Bali (This view alone is worth the cost), from here you head down to a coffee plantation showing you how and where coffee and coco comes from. This is a little side trip before you head on over to the bikes (The bikes and helmets are in amazing condition). The trip itself is all down hill its an easy trip, the views of the rural country side, a stop in a local house and an explanation of their culture are second to none. The day is finished by an optional 6KM uphill cycle or a bus ride to another buffet (for lunch, we did the morning tour and had lunch about 2pm) after which you are transported back home to your resort. The staff on this trip are absolutely amazing, super friendly and highly knowledgeable!!! If there is one thing you should do while in Bali it is this trip, you will never forget this and the views are worth every cent!!!!!!!!!!HIGHLY RECOMMENDED !!!!!"

The guide will explain the history of Mt & lake Batur. Then the 2nd stop was OKA agriculture Bali. We can learn about coffee and cocoa plant, how to make coffee manually , see the Luwak animal and we also can try the coffee and tea products there. It's a nice place. The 3 rd stop was the bicycle start point, we can choose the bicycle which suitable for us, then we go cycling with 2 guides, 1 infront 1 at the back, also the car will follow us, just in case we're tired and want to quit. In my case, coz my daughter fell off, we had to stopped then sat in car until finished, unfortunately we couldn't enjoy the beautiful scenery with bicycle .

            "review": "Best Value Day out ! . Four of us took the Bali Eco Bike Tour after a recommendation from a couple of friends who did this earlier this year.Wow what a blessed day it was. We were treated like kings all day. The mini bus picks you up at any hotel or designated main road point along the way. We were lucky as we only had our small group of just 4 of us as 2 others pulled out . Other groups are normally larger but not too big. Starting with the most delicious Buffett breakfast up along the rim of the volcano at Mt Agung. We are then taken to our bikes several km down the coffee plantation which was nice. The we are dropped at the bike station where we head off down local small sealed roads that have very little traffic. We ride through villages ,past rice paddy fields, people carrying their goods on their heads, temples, and children who want to say hello. We stopped to see a local house and how it functions along with its cows, birds, ducks and roosters ( I think for cock fighting).We see a very big Banyan tree that was around 500 years old. We stopped to walk through a paddy field which was really nice.After another hour of riding ( mostly down hill which makes it so easy for any rider) we get collected by our van driver and taken into Gianyar to the most private and spectacular restaurant overlooking beautiful paddy fields and garden greenery and flowers. The food was the best Balinese food I have every eaten in Bali. So beautifully prepared and tasty but not hot with extra sambal if you wish ! What a great finish to a wonderful day out. Apparently we rode 25 km but it was easy riding as its mostly down hill with just a couple of slight up hill climbs. The bikes are geared and are very comfortable and easy to ride. Our guide Togar was really great and so informative and looked after us well. This was truly good value for money.Thank you Bali Eco Tours for the best day out!!"

While recently in Bali, we wanted to see more of the area around Ubud and the thought of cycling appealed, as it is slow and gives you time to take things in.We chose Eco Cycling as they stressed the educational and learning aspects of the tour and the knowledge of their guides.We were very happy with the tour \u2013 and the mountain bikes were in good order and helmets were provided. The company picked us up from our hotel in Legian exactly when they said they would. We drove to the mountains, stopping at a coffee and tea plantation where we could try the local coffee and teas \u2013 but there was no pressure to buy. Breakfast then followed at a location which overlooked the volcano. A simple but pleasant breakfast and a stunning view. The ride then followed. It was 28 kms in total, with the vast majority of it being either downhill or on the flat. There was only one short stretch on a main road with the rest being back roads. Where traffic was heavier and we had to cross, the support vehicle would stop and the driver would act as traffic cop. The few small hills were not a chore as you simply got off and walked up if you couldn\u2019t ride. I hadn\u2019t been on a push bike for 20 years and had no problems.Regular stops were made along the way, with the two guides (there were eight riders in our group) providing interesting and useful information about the area and culture.We finished at the owner\u2019s family home and compound where he explained the cultural aspects of the family compounds\u2019 designs and how they were arranged and managed. This was followed by a beautiful lunch, cooked and served by members of the family. We were then driven back to our hotel. Allow a full day.Highly recommended."

He knew his stuff and gave us so much info about the local culture, it was so interesting. And he had the most infectious laugh!! It was a great day, we were picked up/dropped off at our hotel in Legian, water provided as well as breakfast, coffee sampling and lunch. Lunch was super delicious and the tastiest food we have had in Bali so far. The bike riding was very easy as downhill the whole way. Anyone of any fitness level can do this, even if you haven't been on a bike for years. We loved it and highly recommend it to everyone!"

The Bali Eco Cycling was just another example of the friendliness and helpfulness of Bali.I was travelling with a toddler and was only interested in the bike ride and not the coffee plantation and the breakfast etc. So they arranged for me to meet them at the start of the bike tour to join the group. However, last minute, they decided to send me and my son off with a guide. We had our own private tour. It was absolutely amazing, my 2 year old loved every second of it, as well as the free bananas provided during one of our stops. The views are absolutely gorgeous and breathtaking.

We pretty well saw what everyone else who has commented on saw, but I didn't expect it to be so enjoyable. It was a pleasure to pass villages, children, and pets on our ride. We had a 7 year old boy with us as well as a 1 and 1/2 year old and 3 and 1/2 year old and the tour provided great bikes with baby seats for the two youngest. The ride itself is great for young kids. My 7 year old boy rode the whole way, but even if you were tired, there was a guide at the back riding a tandem bike if anyone was to tire out. We didn't. Another great option was the grandparents were permitted for a similar fee $40 AUD to come along and enjoy the day with the rest of us and followed the ride at a safe distance in the van. They loved going to UBUD, the mountain, the coffee plantation and they enjoyed having breakfast and lunch with their kids/grandkids. They were made to feel included the whole time. Overall, fantastic trip and we adored Win (or is it Wyn?) our guide who was funny, knowledgeable and concerned at all times for our welfare and safety. Would we do it again. Definitely!"

This tour suits all age groups and all fitness levels.

I mountain bike at home, so decided to get some exercise and see a bit of rural Bali - the main towns have so much traffic and touristy shops, I needed a break from all of that. Was picked up by the tour bus at about 730 at my hotel. Had breakfast at the edge of a volcanic crater, saw a coffee plantation, and then hit the bikes. Bikes were decent. The ride is essentially all downhill so very little work to be done, which was nice after celebrating a friends birthday the night before. Rode through some small rural towns, had several little stops including rice terraces with views of volcanos, and learned about Balinese culture. The last bit of the ride is totally optional, probably about 1.5 or 2 miles of steady uphill, which wouldn't be too bad except we rode it around 2 pm and it was hot, but a nice end to get my heart rate up. Lunch buffet afterwards included, with option to pay for a Bintang or a smoothie too. A great day trip for 40$, I would recommend to anybody,"

Although we booked through their website, it seemed another company picked us up wearing shirts naming another cycling company. Bit confused...On the way from Seminyak to the cycling starting point our driver was directed by police to stop along side of the road which he refused to do and drove off. This made me nervous of his integrity. We were picked up at 7.30am and although given a Balinese style breakfast none of us really ate, we were given lunch at 3pm. My 7 & 9 yr olds were beside themselves! The bike ride was way too long- 35km's mostly downhill and starting at the very top of the road so we rode using brakes for the first 10 kms or so. My 7yr old who has loads of cycling experienced struggled on the main roads and his hands grew tired of squeezing the brakes the whole time. The guys did put him in the car and meet us down the road (making me a little nervous to hand my child over to strangers) The scenery was mostly of nothing more than what you would see driving at this point, on fairly busy roads. I gave up by the last 15kms as I was growing tired myself and jumped back in car with my two kids to meet my husband at the end! It seems the final few kms was where all the scenery finally came to be what we had expected- actually riding though the beautiful rice fields down roads accessed only on bike. My husband said it was beautiful but we missed out being exhausted and sitting in the car! Not a day I would recommend. We have heard from several friends that they enjoyed their bike tours so SHOP around as I don't think we went with the right cycling company."

Starting at the base around 3am and reaching the summit for sunrise around 6am. You do need to be fit and balanced in your surroundings. The total trip is around 8kms going up and down around 1100m in altitude with some steep to extreme gradients. The guides are amazing and willing to help you every step of the way. The long tour does take you around the rim of Mt Batur so if you have a fear of heights this will test you with VERY narrow paths in some of the highest sections. The views make everything worth it and to finish in the hot springs was a great way to end the tour. Minor negative was the food was a little plain for lunch and maybe more of an after thought."

With care and consideration. From the breakfast overlooking a genuinely draw dropping volcano vista, via the witty and detailed commentary of tour leader Agius, to the superb lunch afterwards, this is a well-thought-out, exhilarating and even informative day out. But the real skill is in the human touch of one of the Eco Cycling outriders shadowing for the whole trip an eight-year-old rider unnerved by the sporadic traffic, slowing passing vehicles and quietly reassuring all the way. The bikes are in good condition, the route is almost all on a gentle downward incline, the views are spectacular and the whole thing has the air of a company proud of the way it does business."

We looked at quite a few tours before choosing Bali Eco, neither of us have been on a bicycle for 10-15 years\u2026 so this suited us and seemed great value for money too (\u00a325 each)\u2013 if you are a regular cyclist at home then you may need to look for something more challenging this is mostly downhill with the odd uphill (nothing too strenuous for those who don\u2019t cycle much) but your hand on the break is used more than pedals. So the day starts with a pick up at your hotel (we were in Seminyak) so quite a trek around 2 hrs in Bali traffic in a mini bus, but you get to see some pretty rice scenery along the way and our guide was happy to fill us in too. We stopped at some beautiful rice paddies to view and take pictures and a little explanation. Then we were driven up to Lakeview Restaurant in Kintamani, I have personally never been driven so far in 1st gear (it seemed anyways : ) ) where you receive complimentary breakfast, this is really a very basic buffet with varying options none of which looking too appealing, I had fresh pancake with syrup and bacon and it was \u201cok\u201d the best part about this stop is you can sit outside if you wish and take in the stunning views of Mount Batur truly breath taking. After breakfast back in the mini bus where we travelled to a place called OKA which is a coffee and spices plantation, you get a tour around and some explained having done this in a few countries we know our spices but the coffee site was interesting \u2013 at the end you taste coffee and tea some were lovely and you have an option to taste the Luwak coffee (50k Rupiah) which is nothing really so my boyfriend tried it and said it was really nice! (I don\u2019t drink coffee at home either so skipped the coffee, you can make several purchases here (they take Visa too) we tried some of the chocolate and bought some along with some other bits too. Finally after this we went to the start point of the bike tour, you can chose to wear helmets if you wish (we did) and you have water on your bike. Once everyone is ready you set off your guide at the front then a further guide at the back to ensure everyone stays together and is OK, as previously mentioned the tour is mostly downhill and provides a welcome breeze in the Bali heat. We haven\u2019t done anything like this before and found it to be so lovely just taking in the local village life, and meeting and speaking with some lovely people on the way. There is a stop at a traditional balkanise home, which can seem intrusive but I assume they are paid from the company, and they certainly don\u2019t seem to mind. You take in lost of rice paddies which are beautiful and make a couple of stops to see different parts of the process and also at a giant banyan tree! At the banyan tree we were offered the opportunity for a longer \u201cuphill\u201d return to the final spot which we all declined we carried on and finally we made it to the river side and were picked up for the short ride to the final stop for lunch with a Balinese buffet lunch this was much nicer than breakfast \u2013 rice, fried noodles, chicken curry, various veggie options this was fine. You get comp water or can purchase drinks (Bintang, soft drinks fruit juices etc) for extra it was relatively reasonable compared with hotel prices for similar.If you want a fun different day out and take in the views then this could be for you.

The lunch at the Eco restaurant was excellent and I feel this is a good operation to support. However I felt down by not having the promised 'two English speaking guides ' but rather one 'poor English ' speaking guide and one fellow following up the back of the group for safety , who couldn't speak English at all , so although our guide was a nice fellow we didn't get as much cultural knowledge, as I had hoped for, as he clearly knew more than he could say. Also we only stopped at one artisan who carved doors , and not anything smaller that we could buy."

However, if what you are after is a pleasant day out in the Balinese countryside with a taste of a few different activities and sceneries, this isn't too bad a deal. We chose to do the bike tour with this company because it seemed the most value-for-money we could find. The day starts with being picked up from your hotel/resort in an air-conditioned mini van, after which you are driven right up to Lakeview Restaurant in Kintamani for breakfast overlooking Mount Batur and its caldera. It was quite beautiful a sight to behold, especially since I had climbed that on a previous trip to Bali. The food was not outstanding but I enjoyed the sweet black rice pudding and the Indonesian fried noodles. Thereafter, there is a stop at a coffee and herb plantation for coffee and tea tasting and where you can purchase coffee beans if you would like. You can also sample kopi luwak, or civet cat coffee. I personally disagree with the practice of producing kopi luwak and so did not try any but some in the group did. After this, you will be driven to the start point of the bike tour, where you select your bike and get going. The bike ride is mostly downhill so your fingers do more work braking than your legs do pedalling. The ride was quite beautiful on a sunny day with opportunities to catch a glimpse of village life in Bali. My favourite part was riding past the rice fields, which I always find beautiful. The tour concludes with a Balinese buffet lunch and we got to sample some of my favourite foods like more mie goreng (fried noodles), sweet and spicy tempeh, and gado-gado (vegetables with peanut sauce). Cold drinks can be bought at an extra price but it was reasonable enough for us to order refreshing fruit juices and fresh coconut water. Would I take this tour again? Maybe not, if I really wanted a good bike ride. But if you'd just like to see the sights and have a leisurely day out, this might be for you."

Then followed the trail on mainly big roads (for Bali) with at least five other tourist groups - all stopping in the same places along the way, it just felt odd to intrude in people's daily lifes in such numbers.

The route was mostly down hill, at least for the first half. We made stops at a coffee plantation, a typical Balinese family compound (complete with chickens and pigs), a ride through the rice paddies and a stop at this magnificent Banyan tree. Along the way were school children coming home from exams and it was a \"wedding day\" a day set aside by the Hindu priests for wedding ceremonies, so as we rode, we got to see people in traditional dress, listen to the gamilon music and take pictures along the way. We even stopped to thresh rice (for those that wanted to). Ring was hysterical...he had a lot of good jokes and puns, and was very knowledgeable about his country, his customs, his caste, and his family heritage (as wood carvers). It was so fun! Breakfast and lunch were provided free and we had only 9 in our group and 3 guides to hold up traffic or make sure no one fell behind. It was absolutely fabulous. The second half of the ride only had small uphills and lots of downhills. Get away from the tourist traps and try this eco-excursion. You will be glad you did!"

The breakfast with the mountain view was the best I had so far here, it was a buffer with wide choice. So if you planning a tour with Eco, don't bother to have a breakfast before tour. Bicycle ride itself is 25 km, and pretty much downhill all the way, so don't expect that it will be kinda good exercises. Fingers on the break are working more than legs actually :) There was a big fat man with a knee problem, and even he managed the route. For those who want to exercise more, there is and option at the end of the rout. Last 3 kilometers uphill. The group is splitted in 2 parts, one who cycle uphill, the other goes by bus. At the end of the uphill everybody meets in the lunch restaurant. Lunch was also buffee type with wide selection of Indonesian cuisine. Also included in price with Eco.On the route there is also a stop in Lewak coffee plantations, where it is possible to degustation a lot of teas and coffees and for extra charge to try Lewak coffee.During bicycle ride you will visit typical Balinese compound with explanation of family traditions and relations between younger and older brothers etc.You will stop in the rice field to talk with people working there.It's not a cheap activity, but if you count that many things come included in pack, is not that bad.Enjoy!"

As we drove the main road into town, I realised that battling with the wild Balinese traffic wasn\u2019t going to any more fun than with the heat. So I settled in for a relaxing holiday, interrupted by Bali Eco Tours and their professional day trip.A very early pickup from Sanur, followed by everything else they offer. Including their point of difference \u2013 \u2018the only bike tour offering extra uphill options\u2019. I was the only one to take the guys up on this offer, and I\u2019m glad I did. I mean, I\u2019m still recovering and all, but I\u2019m glad I did. It\u2019s not that it was too steep, just a gradual climb. It\u2019s not that it was too far, indeed just another 45 minutes. The heat and humidity is devastating. Still, if you have just a day to get out on the bike, do the whole trip with the added uphill. The cold Coke at the end in rice paddy eco-restaurant is what 1980\u2019s commercials are made of. I am stingy. I spent far too long searching for the right bike tour in Bali. This is the one."

This tour was by far the most genuine one, as for the first time we were not forced into buying cheap souvenirs from pushy locals. It was also very cultural; you get a taste of the real Bali, and their traditional ways of cooking, farming, and living in general. All the people we passed on the bikes as well as the women who cooked/guided us through making lunch were extremely kind and welcoming. Would definitely do this again."

The Tour itself was a highlight of our trip. The Volcano view at the breakfast location is beautiful, then the stop at the coffee plantation was fun. We were on the bikes soon after and surprised at how well maintained they were with helmets that were also pretty good. Lots of stops along the way made the cycle very easy and I believe even those with minimal fitness would cope because it is mostly downhill. At the end of the tour there was an optional 5km uphill ride, which only 5 of us opted in for. This part got the heart rate up!

Now I am a fairly fit person, but believe me when I say this trek was hard. Especially as you climb up at night with just a flashlight and the terrain is very rocky. But the view of the sunrise you get from the top is amazing and we were lucky to climb on a day with no fog and perfect visibility. The climb down is much easier and the stop at the hot springs really rejuvenates you.Tip: Stock up on water that the tour operator offers at the base of the trek. Once you start climbing you'll have to pay exorbitant amounts for water at the rest points."

Our Bali Eco Cycling 'guide' stayed in the car - which is not what their website says happens, but he did give our breakfast packs to the local guide. We set off in small groups, some 250 climbers this morning heading up the scoria gravel track. We are a fit couple who exercise regularly, but this climb was strenuous exercise for 50+ people. Do not wear jeans or sandals. If like us, you have travelled to Bali with no warm clothing, you can hire some at the trekking start.We did not see the sunrise due to a very high wind and clouds, but on descent you will be amazed at what you achieved in the dark with a torch in one hand!"

            "review": "Big Day Out. Most of the reviews already written sum up my reflections. I will add a few things though.We went with our 11 and 8 year old. Another company offering a similar tour have an age limit of 10 and up, I now know why. Our 8 year old was a pain in the bum. He almost caused a 3 bike pile up by slamming on the brakes without warning. The road we cycled on, whilst lovely and picturesque, was still used by trucks, cars and motorbikes, which caused our son to panic at times. The pace of the ride is also surprisingly fast, and he couldn't keep up, so we lagged behind the main group quite significantly. Having said that, a guide stayed with us at all times, and the tour bus, and bike carrier truck also loyally trailed slowly behind us. At the halfway mark my 8 year old (ok, me) had had enough, and he was parked in the front seat of the bus with Norman our lovely driver, to keep him company for the rest of the way.So my advice is this, unless your kid is over 10 and/or a strong and confident cyclist, leave them in kids club for the day. Also, we were the first pick up in south kuta at 7am, and then had approx 2.5 hours of travel, first picking up other passengers, before getting to the breakfast destination. My boys were so car sick at this point they were green. So take travel sickness medication if you are inclined. And we didn't get back to our hotel until 6pm, so don't plan a big night out afterwards if you have kids.All in all, I loved it, easy downhill run, pedaled about 20% of the 20 km, and was appreciative to be given the option of cycling the last 7 km of UPHILL or not. I chose not, was a good call on my behalf as it turns out, the young 20-somethings that staggered in about half an hour after our air conditioned drive to the lunch restaurant, looked ready to pass out, as I sipped my mocktail.One last thing, our tour desk at the hotel couldn't process the payment for the booking, told us we could pay with visa when we were there, no we couldn't. We had to be specially driven to the headquarters in Ubud to pay, so take cash. Have fun."

Highlights - -bat temple was interesting-water temple was beautiful Lowlights--travel time and vehicle-snorkeling, water was murky and very hard to view anything (due to rip in water)-beach was very dangerous -tour guides uninformative We were thoroughly disappointed with our tour after the website made it look fantastic. Firstly the website has not been updated to the new schedule as some things have been taken out of the tour. Secondly the trip to & from the only snorkeling site (Japenese shipwreck) took some 3 and a half hours! We were staying in Legian and weren't informed of such a long trip, especially since our vehicle was older than I am and not fitted with seat belts or adiquate air-conditioning for such a long haul. Our tour guides failed to inform us when passing viewing sites such as the volcano ect which would have been great to stop and see properly (we had to guess what was a volcano and what was a mountain). Once FINALLY arriving at the snorkel site we were given (well used) snorkeling gear and told pretty much \"there's the water, off you go\" only to find that the beach was rather very dangerous with volcanic rocks rather than sand, unruly waves and a rip in the water. No safety demonstrations at all. We struggled numerous times to even get IN to the water due to the waves being so rough and we were getting tossed around. This could easily be corrected by putting in a jetty of some kind to avoid the rough terrain on the beach making it much easier to get in and out of the water as the ship wreck insnt too far off shore. Once in the water I personally didn't see much at all apparently due to a rip in the water making for terrible veiwing. We only really spent maybe 10 or so minutes in the water after the epic battle of getting in the water. Bathroom facilities at the site also require urgent upgrades. After lunch we were squeezed into our van again and off to the water temple which was actually a very nice place to visit if you are prepared to travel so far out of the main areas in Bali. Then back in the van for our 2+ hour ride back to our hotel, bypassing the offered last stop of a coffee plantation just wanting to get back to our hotel. All in all this day trip could have been missed. Much better snorkelling offered closer to main areas with better transport. If conditions were better and the location closer to us maybe it would have been worth it (only with a jetty!)"

            "review": "Best tour in Bali. Absolutely incredible day out on the Bali Cycling Tour. For the price, it is definitely worth it. We were in Ubud at the time, which was the cheapest place to be picked up from by the taxi service. Started the tour by travelling up to see an amazing view of Mt. Batur whilst having freshly made waffles and pancakes for breakfast, all included in the price. We then visited a plantation where we sampled lots of different coffee and teas. You could pay 50,000IDR for the Luwat coffee (where the small mammal poos out the coffee beans which are used). I bought a cup, and it actually tastes quite amazing, would have bought a pot to take home if I wasn't backpacking for another three months. We then began our cycle tour through the country side of Bali. 90% is down hill, so was very easy cycling. Visited a local Indonesian compound which was very informative on the lifestyle of the Balinese Hindus and how the family and their compound function. We also stopped off at an incredible sacred tree, with fresh bananas provided at this stop. They had two guides with our group, so if anyone wanted to stop for pictures along the route then the guide at the back would wait with them. We ended the tour at a restaurant with a beautiful view over rice fields. The food was amazing, probably the best we've had in Bali. Highly recommend this tour to anyone."

The company cares a lot about safety and there are lots of safety measures in place. A very professional and enriching experience.We started off with buffet breakfast at Lake View Restaurant (amazing view of Mount Batur and the crater lake; slightly chilly so do bring a shawl/ jacket if you're scared of cold). Food was normal though. We then proceeded to a Balinese herb/ tea/ spices/ coffee plantation where we were given a crash course on the various types of plants and coffee harvesting processes in Bali. We had a tea/ coffee tasting session at the end (very nice!).Then came the highlight: cycling!! It was a very easy ride, 25km in total, of which 90% was downhill so you don't really have to ride. Some of the places we cycled past included Balinese houses and rice fields. We had a few pit stops where we learnt more about Balinese life & culture from Punk. The company was super professional when it comes to safety. There were 12 people on our tour (including 2 toddlers), and besides Punk, there were 2 other safety guides who followed us. 1 stayed at the back throughout to ensure that no one was left behind. If you somehow decide halfway that you don't want to cycle anymore, you can get on the van which was trailing behind. Very impressed!! Equipment-wise (bikes, helmets), they were very clean and well-maintained. We ended off with a Balinese lunch buffet at the Pejeng Restaurant overlooking the rice terrace. Lunch was good.I really enjoyed the trip a lot. Regretted not bringing along my Action Cam to record the cycling views because the views along the way are too good to be missed! 2 thumbs up for everything and I will definitely recommend everyone to go for this half-day tour. You will not regret it!"

I have been to Bali many times but never had the opportunity to learn about village life, coffee plantations ( and the famous Lewak coffee ) , cycle through the most sensationally gorgeous rice paddies and villages, enjoy volcanic views and eat a feast of Balinese local dishes - all in one day!The cycle was 98% downhill so very easy - and even though it is away from main roads- there is a bit of local traffic so you still need to take care.But- our guide was fantastic and helped make it a highly enjoyable outing.I read reviews about the breakfast being bad. Well- it was local Indonesian food and not great but not that bad! It was however compensated by the incredible feast at the end of the trip.The highlights were the sheer beauty and tranquility of cycling past rice paddies and cute quaint villages, visiting a village and learning about local customs and the feast at the end! I would do it again for sure! And my teenage daughters (12 and 14) really enjoyed it too!"

We were then taken to Oka Coffee Plantation for a coffee tasting session and informative talk on the ins and outs of making Luwak coffee. The bike ride was a breeze and suitable for all ages and stages. After leaving the start point on my brand new mountain bike (in hot pink), we cruised through the countryside taking in the scenes of rural life in Bali happening all around us. We stopped regularly for water breaks and to check out a local balinese compound and a giant banyan tree. The lunch at the end of the ride was delicious and the chilled towels immdiately after getting off the bikes were a classy touch."

We enjoyed the buffet breakfast as there was a variety including local dishes like black rice pudding. From the time we picked up the bikes, the ride was fun & exhilarating. The guides were helpful, informative & we all felt safe as the roads are 'back roads' away from traffic. We rode through beautiful villages with amazing scenery. We stopped off several times to see a family compound, workers in the rice fields etc. The late lunch at a restaurant near Ubud was amazing with a great range of Indonesian dishes.

(Everyone on the bus also asked) they said, No. We are only paid to take you to the top of the mountain and back. I'd try another company next time.

The cycling tour was enjoyable overall however be warned it is a long day in the car if you're travelling to and from Nusa Dua. For a cycling tour, a relatively short proportion of time is spent on the bikes. This tour includes a stop off at a coffee plantation and I feel compelled to raise awareness of the mistreatment of the civet cat - there were miserable civet cats caged without covering or environmental enrichment. These are nocturnal animals who naturally eat the coffee beans ON OCCASION, not as their staple diet. It appeared there were being fed just the coffee beans in a factory-like operation. When we asked the tour guide about it, he was cagey in his answers and not knowledgeable on their treatment. We felt rotten afterwards having potentially paid a few dollars for a novelty coffee at the expense of a wild animal's quality of life. Please be mindful to support sustainable tourist operations and question your guides - this is critical to ensure 'western-supported' tourist development in places like Bali is something to be proud of."

We were picked up and taken up to the crater enjoyed some fab views and food, then visited a garden/coffee place before jumping on the bikes for a long and easy downhill ride. The ride took us through villages where the kids are still happy to run out and wave, through rice paddies where we stopped and threshed and winnowed some rice (much to the amusement of the labourers) before finishing with a fabulous meal and a drink before heading back to Ubud by 4pm.Ring, our guide was smart and funny and happy to respond to my questions about language and caste and how things work in Bali.

We visited a traditional Balinese house, a coffee plantation where you try all these different and delicious types of coffee and herbal tea, a banyan tree, a beautiful rice field and a couple othr sights. The road offers constant amazing views. Helmet camera highly advisable. We were taken care of very well and expertly guided by the very pleasant and knowledgeable Edi and the great guys riding the tandem (with my scaredy cat girl in the back) and the AC van that picks you up and drops you back at your hotel after a delicious Balinese lunch buffet at another beautiful restaurant.

We woke up at 2am for...Nothing!!! Just a tip from our own experience: make sure you get the guide's mobile number just in case he does not find your hotel!!! Hopefully we could make it the next day!The first stop to the restaurant is absolutely useless at 4am!!! We would rather sleep an extra hour!!!The climb to the top was not difficult, but the guides didn't really have any added value to the experience, although they advertise a \"different, alternative and eco way\" to climb the Mt Batur as opposed to other companies. What a lie!The beakfast at the top was not really good and didn't even include the \"volcano steam cooking eggs\"!They also advertised a walk around the caldeira, but when we asked the guide he simply replied he was not aware it was included into the tour and we didn't have enough time to do it anyway!!The sunrise from the top is stunning, but it could have been even better without the other hundreds of noisy tourists around you!!!"

We also stopped for a meander through the rice fields and a banana energy stop under a beautiful huge 500 year banyan tree by the roadside.Plenty of bottled water was provided during the trip and despite the humidity the breeze as we rode downhill kept us very comfortable.A 2 year old child accompanied us. No problem..the parents had a bike equipped with a baby seat.

The tour itself: Breakfast at with a view of Batur Lake wasn't too shabby at all, and the bicycles were in OK condition. The downhill routing meant that very little leg exertion was needed, and gave riders more time to appreciate the surroundings as well as to keep a watch out for traffic. (Although riding was on relatively quiet country roads, they aren't entirely free of traffic.) The tour guide, being native Balinese, was helpful and a treasure trove of information. The tour was topped off by a pretty decent lunch. All in all, good value."

We started our bike tour at 11am. The bikes look good and the helmets too. The ride is easy, you always go down hill, so after a while you are tired breaking all the time! But don't see this trip as a workout, more of a sightseeing trip. If you want some exersice, then do the last bit of 6km uphill, very hard!. The ride itself was wonderfull. You drive through villages, children are coming back from school and shout hello to you, you can smell the flowers, ducklings are running around, the people are working, chicken are on the street, ceremonys are being held, rice terracces... This is what Bali really is like! The lunch is very tasty also. I think this is a must do when in Bali, to get to know the culture. The price of $40 is worth it. Enjoy!"

My husband and I went on this tour two years ago on our first trip to Bali and really enjoyed it so wanted to take the kids so they can experience real Bali.We were aware of the long trip to get to Ubud and were glad that the bus had been upgraded with comfortable chairs and good air-conditioning.Our guide was friendly enough but very hard to understand so some of the information he provided was lost in translation.The breakfast at Mt Batur was a lot better than last time but still not the best. Make sure you bring food or have something to eat before hand as there is really only pancakes and scrambled eggs to eat but that view of the Volcano makes up for it. After breakfast we headed to a coffee place to have tastings and tried the Luwak coffee (pay 50000 RP) which was OK.We then arrived to get our bikes. Was disappointed that there were no gel seat covers as there were last time and after 25km I did have a sore butt. My hubbies bike would miss gears when he peddled so lucky we weren't doing that too often. Pretty much the whole bike ride is downhill and the bikes had really good disc brakes.We stopped at a traditional home which opened my kids eyes as how 'the other half live' and then our tour guide grabbed one of the massive golden orb spider and placed it on his shoulder OMG!! My very brave daughter was happy to have it on her hand but no-one else dared. We then stopped on the side of the road a couple of times for our guide to show us the rice fields and the Banyan tree but it was no where as good or informative as the last time.At the end of the downhill ride you have the option of doing 6.5km uphill but we were happy to jump on the bus and head to lunch. The lunch was really good and you can buy drinks which are cheap. Our driver then took us the long trip back to our hotel.All in all we enjoyed the experience and would recommend to anyone wanting to see a different part of Bali."

And they responded to my online inquiry within hours. They set me up right away and all I had to do was to put a small amount of deposit. I was staying in Kuta Beach area, so they told me they'd pick me up at the hotel between 1:00a- 1:1:15a. They showed up exactly at 1am. We picked up 2 other groups along the way, total of 7 of us. Our first stop was small breakfast at a restaurant (sorry, forgot the name). Then off to Mt. Batur. They gave each of us a flashlight and bottle of water. We hiked about 45 min, rest about 5 min, the went on for another 45 min. The hike itself was a little challenging but doable. Probably 6 out of 10 in difficulty.

Ours was a small and friendly group from all around the world- we were the oldest by a mile, being 50+, but managed the ride without any problems. Stopping at the rice terraces for a photo opportunity on the way up to the mountains was great. Our breakfast stop was at a restaurant overlooking Mt Batur and the crater lake. The view and photo opportunity was fantastic- the breakfast was not. I would suggest grabbing a couple of danish pastries or something from your hotel to eat on the way rather than counting on the breakfast at Mt Batur. I'm not a fussy eater, but it was not good.We visited a tea and coffee garden and sales place, which was good and didn't include any hard selling. Our guide Pang and driver Suki took us around and Pang shared his knowledge of Bali.The ride was mostly downhill and took us through interesting and beautiful country. There are lots of scheduled stops to have a look around and a break. We visited a family compound, rice fields and the 500 year old banyan tree. Having a guide cycling at the front and the rear of our group of 7 was good. We didn't have to do battle with much traffic as the roads were quiet.At the end of the ride we travelled by van to our lunch spot. With breakfast being pretty lousy, I wasn't expecting much, but lunch was terrific. It was a buffet style set up with delicious options- curries, satays, salads, rice dishes- plenty of everything and all very tasty. We bought our own drinks at the lunch stop, which was fine, and all had a fresh fruit plate to finish off.This was a great day, one I'm very glad to have done. Pang was terrific."

We booked the tour in order to see more of the \"real\" Bali.We were expected to be picked up at 7 however due to traffic we were collected at 8. The journey from the hotel to the site for breakfast is very long, over 2 hours although once you arrive the views are amazing! You can see the volcano and the lake and it's amazing to see.Unfortunately the breakfast is a little hit and miss, a mix of rice, noodles, bacon tomatoes, pancakes, black rice pudding and a few other bits.Once breakfast is done you're back on the bus to the coffee plantation. Our second since being in bali and this one is great. So much to see and the guide is great at explaining everything. Tasting the coffee is also great and the kopi luwak is 50000 rupiah to try. We had tried before so didn't this time. There are a range of fruits available to buy here including the durian fruit and snakeskin fruit, and different coffees teas and spices to buy.From here it's a short drive to the bikes. It was at this point that the heavens opened with so much rain! We were provided ponchos although the rain was so intense we still got soaked! The cycle is downhill all the way and perfect for all abilities. You visit a family compound which is great to see a traditional balinese home. Stop at a banyan tree as well as rice paddies.It was unfortunate that the rain was so bad we couldn't appreciate the scenery and cycle as much. At points on the cycle it was like riding through a river! At the end you have the option of a 5k cycle with a little uphill but mostly flat. We decided against this mainly because of the weather...we just wanted to dry off ha ha!At the end you have lunch which is a selection of traditional balinese fare. Drinks are available at an extra cost, but are very reasonable. The food was generally good.Following this, it's the long journey back to the hotel.Overall the tour and guide was great, the only thing that could have been a little better was the food. The rain was shocking so be prepared and take a towel or change of clothes! This is not one to be missed though. Such a great tour of the real bali!"

This is a well balanced day out and in our case we were blessed with an amazing guide 'Ring' who not only knew his stuff, but was funny and managed the various ages and nationalities really well. Helping with Rice harvest, visiting a compound, playing in a rice paddy, the new spider facebook photos and the tour at the coffee farm were all features worth mentioning. I would recommend checking your bike well before you start - two of us had rather poor brakes and the result for one ofthe group was a nasty fall and significant bruising.I'd highly recommend the tour - no real need for great cycle experience or too much fitness."

Its a long drive up to the starting point but the views are amazing. Breakfast overlooking the volcano is impressive. You don't actually go on the volcano. You head back down the hill and start your ride in a little village. The riding is all on little back roads and all down hill. You hardly need to peddle. You might be sick of squeezing the brakes by the end. You see inside a local house and a rice field. I felt like I knew a little more about Bali afterwards. The food was nice and Nano is a very knowledgeable guide."

The drive up from Seminyak took forever but once we arrived at Mt Batur the whole day was awesome! The views from the Kintimani restaurant were stunning & yes the buffet was a bit weird as others have said but still Ok.A short drive to the coffee plantation & our fabulous guide Wayan took time to explain all the different plants growing there, their uses & history in Balinese culture. We saw the Luwak asleep in its enclosure & saw the coffee beans in all their stages from green through to roasting & grinding by hand. We then sat in the garden to sample the different teas & coffees & also had the choice to pay $5 to try the fresh Luwak coffee but there was no pressure to buy at all.Another short drive to the spot where the bikes were waiting for us, choose a bike (my tip- look for a comfy seat, the gears weren't really used much but you'll appreciate a good seat!) Then it was off on our 22km ride. We stopped regularly as Wayan explained lots of cultural things along the way, visited a traditional family compound & even helped some women harvesting their rice crops. The riding was easy, mostly free wheeling, watch for a few pot holes in the roads though! A GoPro would have been the best way to capture all the scenery as taking stills whilst riding was a little tricky & you do see some beautiful landscape along the way.The late lunch at the end was really delicious & very traditional, especially good after a long day of cycling! Our daughter had a fall right at the end of the ride (just a grazed knee, nothing serious), Wayan was fantastic, immediately washed & applied Betadine & took great care to check she was ok to continue. My husband did the 5km uphill at the end with a couple of others, they said it was pretty tough so keep that in mind if you're considering it.We had the best day & would recommend it to anyone!!!"

The local guide will try to stop you at \"congratulations\" point - a large balcony for sunrise viewing where most groups stop. Insist on continuing to the summit before the sunrise at 6am. It's only another 20min slog through ash and so worth it. Walking around the caldera was the highlight! Take more care on the descent as it can be a little slippery (lots of loose gravel). Don't forget to look back once you reach the bottom - amazing view of Mt Batur!"

The countryside and rice fields were stunning, and the guides are able to plan a nice relaxing route that keeps you off of any busy roads and away from traffic. The local kids seem to get a kick out of watching the group ride by. The guides also take time to explain some of the local culture as you go, with many planned stops along the way. It was one of the best experiences I had in Bali, and much more fun and educational than the cultural \"shows\" in town if you have to choose. If you're up for it, try to combine this with the Mt. Batur trek by the same tour company...they will simply drop you off where the cycling group is eating breakfast at the beginning of their day and you won't miss a thing. The cycling is quite easy - the route is very flat - so as long as you make it through the hike the rest of the day will be a breeze."

I would say breakfast isn't the best - it's a bit of a weird buffet - BUT, the views overlooking lake Batur volcano are absolutely worth it. Also lunch is very tasty! The bikes are okay but many had broken gears and weren't adjustable which is the only downside of the tour.

Keep asking questions.- The detailed coffee testing session.- The most sumptuous lunch ever had in Bali (includes number of Veg options, with starters prepared specially for Veg guests)*The only thing they need to work on is to change the Helmets they provide with the bikes, as mostly were broken.Added information: - Just email them your booking preference and additional requests, they will quickly revert.- We even got USD 5/ person discount for Ubud pick up. Discounts on other areas also apply.- They also accommodated our request of dropping at a different (from the pick-up) location, along with our 2 trolley bags, at a nominal additional charges.The tour is good for the age group of 15 - 65 years."

The day started around 7:30 when the shuttle picked us up from our hotel in Ubud. We were then taken to a restaurant overlooking Mt. Babur for a buffet breakfast with amazing views. The breakfast consisted of fruit, bread, pancakes, eggs, etc. After breakfast we were taken to a coffee plantation where we got to sample several different coffees and teas. For around $4 a cup you can try the Luwak coffee too. I liked the fact that there was no sales pitch or pressure to buy anything, they just give you a little time to look around the shop if you want to buy anything after the tasting. For about $23 you can buy a small jar of the Luwak coffee to take home and share. After the coffee plantation it was time to start riding! Most of the route was downhill and is suitable for people of just about any fitness level. We had a group consisting of people in their early 20's to late 50's. Along the route you stop a few times and the guide gives you time to take some photos of the countryside. We also visited a small family compound where we got to see how a typical family lives, which was very interesting! After the ride you can either continue cycling to the restaurant for lunch, or you can take the car. Only continue cycling if you're looking for a workout as there was a lot of incline. The lunch was very good and there was a nice variety (even for vegetarians). We arrived back at our hotel around 4:00, so it was basically an all day activity. We had a great time and our tour guide was fun. If you're planning on going to Bali, this is a must!"

There was a large range of bikes to choose from even tandems! They were not as comfortable as your own bike I'll admit but still adequate. With bottled water provided we were ready to get going. As described, most of the ride was downhill and my friend who had only recently learnt to ride was very apprehensive especially with the traffic on the road. We had a guide at the front (Wayan) and a guide at the back and he stayed with her at the back the whole time. There was also a vehicle at the rear for anyone who wanted to take a break. Riding through the villages and passed the rice fields was such a joy. All the children we passed were smiling and waving at us. We visited a traditional balinese home which we found facinating. We were told everything from food preparation, ceremonies and their daily working life. We had a lot of rain that day but that didn't dampen our spirits. We had a delicious lunch...well deserved after a long ride. Such a beautiful setting too overlooking rice fields.

We stopped at a coffee plantation on the way up, and you get to see a Lowak and try all different types of coffee, tea and fruits. After being picked up at just after 7am, it was close to 10am before we got to breakfast, so you may want to having something before leaving.Breakfast was okay - but it's about the view not the food. It's a spectacular place and really does take your breath away. The food was fine - fruit, rice and pancakes - enough to fuel you up!The bikes were in relatively good condition, don't be afraid to try a few out to find one you are comfortable one, the same with the helmets. The bike ride itself isn't too demanding, a couple of uphill parts this not-so-fit person struggled with, however you can jump off and walk (as a few of us did). Loved the ride, going through the small villages and seeing the incredible architecture and sights, as well as the gorgeous kids and their smiles!We stopped at a compound, some rice fields and an old Banyan tree (where you'll get a banana to keep your energy up), all the stops were interesting. We finished up with a great lunch in some rice fields before the journey back to our villa. It was probably 4.30pm-ish in the afternoon by the time we got back.There were 12 people in our group, a great size and really friendly people. The guides had plenty of water for us also."

Our guide Ray, was fantastic! Energetic and engaging. He was attentive to everyone's needs and full of great humors to entertain the group. I would join this group again for a different activity and thoroughly recommend this group to other travellers"

This day out was great, started with a 7 am pick up at villa in Bali, Breakfast at lookout Restaraunt , spectacular views , decent meal, don't fill up on coffee as next stop is a coffee plantation, tried about 3 coffees and a few teas and hot chocolate, great for a coffee lover, loved the coconut coffee , next was a short drive to our push bikes, the ride was a gentle ride through beautiful countryside, we stopped at a typical Balinese home and had an educational talk about daily life and traditions, followed by more riding through gentle downhill roads and pathways, a couple more stops at educational spots then we got offered to ride the last part gentle uphill which was 6.5 km, it was fairly gentle but in Balinese heat and humidity not for the faint hearted or elderly , then a beautiful lunch at a lovely place , then on the bus and home, our guide Eddy was fun, informative and professional all day, special mention to Eggy, he was a great character"

The price was expensive and varied greatly from others in our group. The bicylcles were shocking and the gears didnt work. The breakfast and lunch was average at best. The guide was nice but that was about it. We also booked The Mt Batur hike with this company and found the guide to be much better. Still breakfast was quite poor. I would recomned this tour company only because it wasn't bad overall and Im not sure if there are other companies that would be that different or better."

We did a home exchange with a family who had been living in Bali for 12 years and they recommended this company from among the MANY companies in Ubud offering bike tours. We're glad we took their recommendation and had one of the best experiences of our trip.High Points:1. We had an articulate, well-informed and amusing guide.2. It included a drive up to the volcano and lake for a delightful breakfast. It's a bit of a drive, so eat a light snack to hold you for the hour's ride.3. The guide took us on less traveled roads (and even across some fields) than some of the other groups we saw doing bike tours and that was a definite plus--no need to navigate around scooters and cars.4. We had numerous stops: to taste Luwak coffee (fermented in the intestines of little varmints), to visit a traditional Balinese home compound, to thresh rice in a rice field (beware of stepping into hidden holes) and to swing on a Banyan tree.5. The tour ended with a fabulous buffet lunch at an open air restaurant.6. The price was very reasonable @$30 per personLow points:1. the bikes were not in the best of shape and hard to shift, but since it was mostly downhill, it wasn't a big problem."

            "review": "A tired product that needs a rework.. We chose Bali Eco Cycling as it came well recommended even though it was quite the most expensive choice. We were picked up in an adequate van and taken about an hour to breakfast overlooking the Batur Volcano and crater lake. It was an excellent view with a terrible tasteless breakfast that was an insult. After this we had another hour before we got onto bikes which looked abused and in fairly poor repair. The two hour ride was nearly all downhill, with four stops to look at a deserted Balinese family compound, a large banyon tree, some people harvesting and threshing rice and an empty cockpit where one of the guides answered my questions about cock fighting. I found the information sketchy, the ride was interesting only in that it took you through some nice countryside and villages, but was too short. We are only moderately fit but this tour was angled to the lowest possible level of rider and basically it was boring. Lunch was much better than breakfast and more representative of Balinese food and then we drove back to Ubud(it was all over). Given we were not picked up until nearly 8am, it would work better to have breakfast in hotel, drive up to admire volcano (forget awful breakfast) and then hop on the bikes for a more interesting and variable ride maybe with more information. We've traveled a bit and cycled in a few countries and this tour was no more fun than what we have arranged for ourselves using a phone GPS. This company needs to look at its product and seriously redesign to stay competitive."

What a great way to see some of the 'real' Bali. Other reviewers have already referred to quality of the leaders, , the amazing views at breakfast, fantastic scenery, cultural experiences, the lunch afterwards! I am not particularly fit, and I found the ride was not that hard, it really is downhill most of the way! You are on minor roads, the traffic can be a bit daunting, but the vehicles don't go that fast and once you realise they are not going to hit you, you can relax and accept this is Bali!Most of our group opted out of the last bit that is uphill back to the compound for lunch.I just wanted to particularly mention that my traveling companion, who was a little apprehensive about the ride, did not really want to go on after the first rest stop. Too long since she had been on a bike, together with feeling uncomfortable with the passing traffic. Fortunately the support bus is there for such people. However, by the next rest break they had organised tandem bike. My friend completed the rest of the trip, was able to concentrate on the magnificent scenery and be part of a hugely fun and enjoyable day."

            "review": "A Little Bit of Everything. This was a good day-long outing. You get to see the Bali outside the walls of your beach resort. And instead of looking through a car window, you are doing it at a slower pace. The itinerary might differ with other tour companies, but this is how mine went:1. Hotel pick up at 6:30 AM (because I was staying so far South). And forget about \"Island Time\". these guys were punctual.2. After driving all over the island to pick up my other tour mates, we visited a coffee plantation. Here we learned about Kopi Luwak and found out what the fuss was all about. I thought it was a little tourist-trappy, BUT I have to admit I had a good time. And I had to try the notorious Kopi Luwak.3. Next up: Breakfast on the ridge (Kintamani?) with a nice view of lake Batur and the volcano.4. Then we got on the bikes. First stop was a Balinese home compound. Learned some interesting things about funeral customs and who inherits the house (why birth order is so important) and got an idea of the daily routine of a rural family.5. Off to bike the rice paddies. I was hoping to see folks doing the harvest but it was the wrong time of year. Be careful with the uneven ground. I took an embarrassing spill when I misjudged it.6. Back on paved road. Biked through some gorgeous countryside. The route is mostly a gentle downhill. Not difficult at all. At the last stop, we were given the option to bike uphill to the restaurant, or ride the van. All of us were lazy bums and everybody voted to get in the van. :)7. Good Balinese lunch at a restaurant. Then dropped everybody off at their hotels. I got to my hotel with a couple of hours of good beach time to spare.Bali Eco Cycling runs an excellent tour. It was very easy to book via their website - even when I did it last minute (I was making up my itinerary as I went along). They responded promptly and were very accommodating. The guides were capable, knowledgeable, took good care of us, and were good at keeping us on schedule. The food was good. (I think the company that runs Bali Eco also owns the restaurants.) Dress light. Remember to bring sunscreen. Go with the flow.I enjoyed my day out. Thumbs up for this tour."

You are taken to the top of a mountain with excellent views, given breakfast, taken downhill, given a bike and then you roll down quite mild slopes, through villages, past fields to the bottom of the hill. Then you're taken to a restaurant and fed lunch. All good. The road was well maintained and had little traffic. I could go as slowly as I wanted and enjoyed the quiet peaceful surrounds. We were taken into a family house and the lifestyle was explained. This was excellent to see but the compound we went into was dirty and didn't feel healthy. Please note that later I saw other compounds that were much cleaner and comfortable and most people don't live in those conditions."

There were two guides, one rode in the front to lead us and the other rode in the back. As it is hot during cycling, we dropped by along the way to see the villages, local workshops or to taste local coffee so that we wouldn't be too tired. What i like most about the tour is the staff. They are really kind and helpful. I missed the tour the first day due to my misunderstanding about the pick-up time and had to go to the office. They just booked the tour for the next day for me without additional charge and a guy at the office offered to ride me back to my hotel for free. The local guide's life is interesting, too. It was really eye opening listening to him. Also when my bike's chain was out two times during cycling, the guide was willing to help me and rode beside me. Highly recommended!"

A friend recommended I do this and I would have to say it was overall a brilliant thing to do on any trip to Bali.Communication via email was easy and I got responses within a day. They pick you up from where you are staying in Bali, around 7.15am and then its about a 2 hour drive in an air-conditioned mini bus - tip sit in the front to avoid the bumpy roads. You stop at the top of the Volcano crater at a restaurant for breakfast - with a killer view. Henry our guide was fantastic - very funny, friendly and very helpful. Then its a 10 minute drive to taste various coffees - highly recommend you pay the 50,000 RP and try the Luwak coffee - very smooth and great tasting. You also get about 6 other teas/coffees to taste for free - Ginseng, lemongrass, ginger, rosella, cocoa, bali coffee and coconut coffee - all good - although I'm not a fan of the Bali coffee.There is of course a shop there you can purchase coffee, chocolate and spices - but no pressure at all. Then its off to get the bikes and helmets. A guide rides at the front and another at the rear and the roads are delightful quiet country roads with very little traffic and lots of smiling kids high fiving as you pass by. It is 99.9% downhill with very minor uphills which you can easily get to the top of going fast enough down hill. You stop at a house - in our case it was our tour guide's house - he took us in and showed us how they lived. Then we travelled to a rice paddy where they were harvesting the rice - we even had a go at banging the rice grains off after walking into the field and observing at close hand how they were harvesting it. The scenery you ride through is nothing like you see on the normal drives around Ubud - it is peaceful and beautiful. They provide you with plenty of bottled water and at a stop halfway into the ride under a 500 year old Banyan tree for a short rest a delicious Balinese banana - so sweet. Then its a 45 minute ride to the restaurant just outside Ubud amongst more rice fields. You have the choice of riding the last 10kms up hill to the restaurant or leaving your bike at this point and jumping back in the minibus - highly recommend bus - you are quite hot after being out in the sun for about 2 hours riding - not because the riding is hard as its all down hill. After a short 10 minute drive you arrive at a beautiful location for a simply delicious Indonesian lunch. You have the option of buying soft drinks or a Bintang - water is free. They cater for vegetarians and ask about food allergies. Try the satay tofu - simply the best satay sauce ever! Great lunch and great value overall. After lunch its a drive back through Ubud and drop off back into wherever you are staying we arrived back in Seminyak around 4.30pm.Definitely a must do for people wanting to see the real countryside and how people live in Bali. The bike ride is easy, we had a couple of girls 8 and 10 in our group and they managed well. I noticed they had a tandem bike and a bike with a baby seat at the back. The helmets looked Ok and the bikes were mountain bikes all in pretty good condition. You don't need to be super fit, just able to ride a bike, use a camera and have a sense of fun and adventure."

The trek itself was an amazing personal experience, but no thanks to the guides at Bali Eco Cycling. We started off from the base following the two guides (English speaking and local). Halfway through the tour one of the trekkers was experiencing knee pain and had to stop and the english speaking guide had to wait there with her. We continued onward with the local guide who simply ran up without any regard of the group and whether we even made it to the top. When we somehow made it to the top, he simply came around, collected his flashlights and did not really bother telling us about the site or showing us around the volcano crater. The food was not really cooked in volcanic steam, it was cooked on a portable stove and was served with flies hovering all over it. The website mentions ample water would be provided. We were given one 500ml bottle each at the beginning of the climb and the guide was not carrying any more when we asked. Luckily we rationed our water consumption before we knew about this and had enough while coming down. Overall it was because the local guide simply didn't care. If the english speaking guide would have made it to the top with us, it would have been very different.As a side note to other travelers, if you have pre-existing conditions please do not participate in activities that may amplify the condition. You not only risk your own health but also disturb the experience of your fellow travelers."

If you have, like we do, even the slightest adventurous bone in your body you will find the tour very tame and touristy. We felt like tourists on a production line. 1. We were picked up at 7.45 am and we did not get on our bikes until around 11.30 am.2. We were first taken to a restaurant for breakfast that overlooked Mt Batur and the lake - which was a great view and an ok breakfast. 3. We were then taken to a local produce \"Balinese garden\" - which was half dead, filled with touristy junk to buy, and a poor fruit selection. We were also given a selection of Balinese coffees - which were little more than flavoured powder and sugar. There were also numerous nocturnal civets locked in barren cages that were provoked out of their slumber for our attention. In this barren garden there was one pineapple plant that was in a poor state. You would seriously be better off exploring the food and drink of Bali in the numerous stalls around Ubud.4. After finally waiting for everyone we were taken to the start of the bike tour, where it was another wait for the other busloads to depart on their bikes. The bikes were in usable condition but far from great. 5. The ride is all downhill, but moves at a very slow pace as you are all single file. Most of the time is spent braking when all you want to do is coast at a leisurely pace. 6. There are frequent stops where the guide is informative, however the information is nothing you can't learn by reading the introductory section of any major guidebook (lonely planet, etc). We also went inside a local homestead which felt invasive. There was an old lady with her back to us weaving a basket, we were then allowed to walk around their house. 7. After finally finishing the ride we were taken to a Balinese lunch. We were under the impression it was going to be in Ubud and we could just leave, however it was at a restaurant outside of Ubud, owned by the company. I asked if we could leave and a get a taxi, as we did not want to wait for everyone, and were told we could not get a taxi that far from town. The guide was enthusiastic and informative so for some this could be the perfect tour. The amount of cycling is minimal - roughly an hour or so for about an 8 hour day door to door."

The terrain was very repetitive (and it is not difficult to get a variety here), the bikes were not well serviced. The breakfast at the lakeview restaurant was mediocre at best. A long distance to drive (with a not-very-safe driver) which added hours onto the day - totally unnecessary. The lunch was better. A lot of hanging around to pick up other passengers. We started the day at 0745 but never got on a bike until after 1100. Too much doing 'other stuff' and not the real cycling. It is disappointing when they continually hint for tips for the drivers, guides etc."

The guides provide torches but do bring your own as backup. The climb can be challenging, especially nearer the peak where it gets steeper and rocky - make sure you have proper footwear. The views from the peak and on the way down are rewarding, so hang in there when the going gets tough! The coordinator provided sufficient pre-departure info which managed expectations of the climb and the weather conditions. It can be cold and wet (due to the cloud cover and morning dew) at the peak, do bring a waterproof jacket. Our guide, Dewa, and the local guides were clearly familiar with the route and concerned with our personal safety so that was reassuring, especially during the pre-dawn trek when one can hardly see anything! On a side note, if you are considering doing a cycling tour, do it with Bali Eco. I did my first with them last year and had an awesome time! As this was my second time to Bali, I did it with another operator hoping to experience a different route. The thought Bali Eco put into planning gives them an edge in terms of the cycling route, cyclist safety and quality of the tour. You will be rewarded by the views you get of the countryside!"

The communication beforehand was excellent as were the employees we had the pleasure of interacting with during our hike of Mount Batur but unfortunately the size of the group dampened the experience greatly for us. We are physically fit (nothing crazy, I feel like just averagely so!) and we had to stop every five minutes and wait for five minutes or more for the rest of the group to catch up, even though there were four guides with a group of 13. It's not a extremely hard hike, but it is going up a mountain, so waiting for people wearing sandals got frustrating pretty quickly (which is not the companies fault) I just wish we had been allowed to go ahead instead of completely missing the sunrise. Next time Id stay nearby and get a private guide from the mountain association which is based at the parking lot at the base of mount Batur"

Picked up from hotel after the hotel rang and booked it for me and even they said it was the best company so I felt confident about the trip. I'm also not particularly fit but found the cycling very easy! We were taken to the rice terraces which was completely unexpected and A lovely surprise we were there so early it wasn't busy either. It was followed by a beautiful breakfast overlooking the mountain lake, we then went to a coffee plantation and sampled Balinese coffee and the famous Luwak coffee..... We then got our bikes and set off on a 25km cycle ride don't panic though it's mainly downhill (there are 2 small inclines not even hills...) and enroute we stopped at a Balinese compound to learn the way of life in Bali, a rice paddy that was being harvested and also a wood carving workshop before ending the trip with a huge lunch we were back in Ubud for about 3.30 where to relax from all that hard(!) cycling I had a massage!! You get such a lot in in just one day like this I thought and your money's worth and it cost 420,000 (approx \u00a322) The guide, Rocky, was extremely knowledgeable and it was his first time leading a group and he did brilliantly. The bikes are well maintained and they provide you with a helmet and bottle of water - it also started raining and they had plastic rain macs which were just what we needed. Highly recommend"

I would give this 5 stars, but the breakfast (in our experience) let it down a wee bit.Our guide was funny and experienced, although we weren't 100% sure what his name was - he gave our group members 3 different names. He was great taking us through the cultural significance of the volcano and lake where breakfast was served, walking us through the organic coffee plantation, Balinese home, rice paddies and a whole lot more. Bike tour is essentially downhill the whole way, with the option to pedal 8km uphill to get to lunch. If you're going on the tour to get a little bit of exercise, then I would recommend the uphill. It's not steep, but you will definitely get a sweat up; which will be gone by the time you've finished lunch!Definitely value for money with breakfast, coffee plantation, Balinese home tour and lunch included.NB: The day we went, the breakfast location was covered in flies, which is the reason for the dropping of a star. That could well be seasonal, or just a bad day, so take from that what you will."

Don't think your fitness levels are up there - never fear. the hardest part of this bike trip is giving the bike trip back at the end.

We got picked up in Sanur, which was great because its free transport. Not great, because it meant an extra 45 minutes in the car while we rounded up everyone along the way. The minibus was clean and roomy so we just slept.(the driver was an absolute champion the way he negotiated the think streets of Ubud). The bus trails you as a sort of security blanket so if by some freak accident you hurt yourself you can catch a ride. We loved the entire day, don't want to give it away as part of the fun was not knowing what to expect. the scenery is astounding, and the staff are lovely and chatty. Our guide was very witty and didn't mind some good jokes thrown in throughout the day. A full day of entertainment at a very reasonable cost! Breakfast and lunch included.

Our guide was great (I forgot his name) and directed the day and time to what the group was feeling (more time than usual at the lookout cafe for breakfast with stunning views).Only negative thing I have to say about this company is that we were not offered a discount when booking 2 tours (the cycle tour and Mt batur trek). I think if booking 2 tours for 2 people you should be offered a discount as incentive to book. We ended up just booking the cycle tour with this company and mt batur trek through our hotel as it was much much cheaper.

The driver and our tour guide Wayan picked us up in the morning fromour hotel as scheduled and there was only one other guest in the car (three guests in total). We were staying in Nusa Dua but its slightly north and other tour companies usually charge extra to pick us up there, but they didn't charge us which was great! The driver first stopped at a really picturesque area in Ubud of the rice patties so we can take photos. He never rushed us even though we took so many pictures and took so long! Then we continued our drive to Lakeview restaurant where you could see the magnificent Batur volcano and the lake! It was truly breathtaking eating breakfast here. The breakfast buffet was GOOD! Very unexpected! They had really good nasi goreng, fresh fruits (mangos were so ripe and sweet), thin and delicious crepes (although they call it pancakes I think), black rice pudding, etc. Wayan thoroughly explained to us where we will go, our itinerary, timing, etc. and he really took the time to explain about the volcano, it's history, how it was formed, the lake and the villagers, which made the trip very educational. Other excursions focus on bringing you to places to spend money - but not this one. Wayan was so knowledgeable with every destination we stopped at.We made our way to the plantation where they had Luwak coffee, grew cacao plants, bananas, cinnamon, pineapples, you name it! We got to try all these different types of teas and coffees too. There was never any pressure for us to purchase anything which was very refreshing.We then made our way to pick up our bikes. The bikes were in good condition and had helmets - so we were good to go. We rode around all the different sites and countrysides, and went inside a traditional Balinese family's home and learned about their way of life. We rode past various rice fields and Wayan would stop at the appropriate points for rest or pictures. He went at our pace. There was also another person at the very end biking at the back to ensure we didn't lose anyone AND our van was following us with our stuff so there is no need to think about bringing a backpack and riding with it and being all sweaty! Best of all, our tour group was small, only three of us, so it felt like it was a private tour. I noticed other tour groups had so many people and it can get tiring trying to go at their speed and having to ride in single file.Another thing: the tour is mainly downhill, so you do virtually no pedaling throughout the two hours! I didn't feel tired or anything cause we were going at our own pace. Lastly, we stopped at a designated restaurant just for cycling tours and it was one of the best meals I've had in Bali. It was a traditional Balinese lunch, buffet style. So delicious. The pictures speak for themselves. Thank you so much Wayan for giving us such a memorable experience in Ubud. Someone needs to give this guy a raise cause he was honest, helpful, and knowledgeable throughout every aspect of the tour. Keep up the great work!!"

            "review": "Relaxing Cruise Through the Balinese Countryside.... We participated in this excursion during our stay in Bali in October 2014. This tour company did not disappoint and we enjoyed a full day seeing various sights in the Balinese countryside. Pick up:Since it was low season, the pick ups were pretty spread out, so we were among the first to get on the van just before 7 am. The van had A/C and about 14 seats. The company kept our tour small and our group consisted of 8 adults and three children, ages 3.5-8 years old. We spent about 2.5 hours collecting other group members, which felt kind of long but again, with it being low season, not as many vans were running so I believe that they try to group guests together to make for shorter rides otherwise. While we drove to pick up other guests, the cyclist guide pointed out places of interest along the way and explained our itinerary in detail. Our last group member pick up was in Ubud so along the way we saw some very extensive, green, and gorgeous rice paddies, which were set into hills and surrounded by lush vegetation. Breakfast:Breakfast was up in a mountainous area in a restaurant that other cycling and tour groups use, so it was all foreigners. The food was okay, not great, but okay. Breakfast included a variety of rice dishes, some sauces and accompaniments for the rice, fresh fruit, eggs, and pancakes (chocolate and regular). They also served water, coffee, and tea. This is all included in your tour package. The restaurant itself isn't what made the breakfast but rather the view it afforded! There is a balcony and outdoor patio which overlook the largest freshwater lake in Bali. The lake is flanked by two volcanoes, one active and the other inactive. The day we were there the temperature was a bit cooler and it was slightly windy but we sat outside anyway to enjoy the scenery. The restaurant is only a 10-15 minute ride to the start of the tour. The agricultural center:Following breakfast, we departed for the agricultural-coffee part of the tour. This place consisted of gardens and paths, which are lined with various plants native to Bali. Our tour guide talked easily about different fruits, trees, etc., native to the area. He also explained the process that yields Kopi Luwak, or civet coffee (just google it-it's a strange process but the end product is good). The center even had a civet but s/he was sleeping since it is a nocturnal creature. We were also able to view the various stages of coffee beans from raw, to roasting, to roasted and ready for consumption. Our group then sat down to enjoy a selection of various coffees and teas, also included in the tour package. For an additional cost you may purchase a cup of Kopi Luwak, which we didn't since we had tried some previously. Following this time, we had a few minutes to walk around, ask more questions, and check out the tourist shop where you may purchase the coffees and teas you've just sampled. After this we left for our cycling tour, only 10 minutes or so away. You can pay with cash or credit card here. The tour:Multiple groups begin at the same start point, which is a parking lot full of tour bikes. We had time to choose our bikes (a bit older but they did the job), adjust our helmets, discuss safety tips, learn about the bike gears, and braking. They have tandem bikes available, kid-sized bikes, and a bike with a basket seat, which suited the 3.5 year old just fine. Also, to allay any fears about the intensity of the ride, IT'S ALL DOWNHILL AND VERY EASY. At various points, when there was no traffic, it was quite easy to spread out a bit and coast down the hills, which felt nice. Also, all bikes have water bottles and the van followed us so if anyone had run out of water or grown tired, it would have been easy to switch from bike to van. We were also able to leave our bags on the van instead of carrying those. Our first stop was at a local, countryside, Balinese home compound. Our guide shared various facets about life for families in the Balinese countryside. The family in turn receives a monthly stipend for allowing the tour group to visit their home. We continued on and made our way through more village areas, lined with temples, schools, and house compounds. After a bit we came to areas surrounded with vast rice paddies and we stopped again so that our guide could explain more about the paddies, rice growing practices, and harvest. This was simply beautiful! Also, because it was low season, we didn't have to contend with too many other groups and the riding part was nicely paced. Our last stop was at a local village's banyan tree, located alongside of a temple area. Our guide explained that the villages often \"adopt\" a banyan tree and then become responsible for its upkeep since they designate it sacred. Our group ended our tour along a river area, where we had the option of riding in the van to lunch, a 10-15 minute drive, or taking an uphill route via bike to lunch for a good workout. None of us elected this option since we were all warm and hungry. They also distributed cool towelettes to wipe off after the ride. Those felt SO good! Overall the cycling part lasted about 2.5 hours and consisted of a mix of cycling through shady and non-shaded areas. Lunch:Lunch is part of the tour package and was served in a covered, open-air restaurant also in the midst of rice paddies. There were large carafes of iced water, a buffet of Balinese dishes, and satay available (however, only 2 satay sticks per person!). Lunch was definitely better than breakfast and there were a lot of options, both with and without meat. We were able to pay for the tour at lunch, either with cash or the restaurant's credit card machine. Overall we really enjoyed our cycling trip and would recommend this company to anyone. It was great to see more of Bali, especially the countryside. The tour cost us each about $20 USD, which for a full day, two meals, and all we did, was a fantastic value! Well done!Verdict: Chiu should do it!"

A full day of adventure and experiencing the local culture of Balinese people. Any fitness level can manage as it is 99% downhill cycling. The breakfast overlooking the volcano and fresh water lake was breathtaking and the lunch was delicious. This is definitely a tour worth doing, if you want to try Balinese food, get a little exercise, see the more remote areas of Bali and spend a day out."

            "review": "Great Day, absolutely worth it. The guys at Bali Eco Cycling are obviously on to a winning formula. Everything worked really seamlessly about the day. I was notified at my hotel about a slight change in pick up time, pick up from Sanur was free and comfortable.The breakfast was good, with wonderful views. The bikes were in good condition and very serviceable. I loved the fact that it was a really comfy padded seat - good for a very out of condition and practice cyclist like me! There were water bottles provided on each bike. You can leave your bag in the bus quite safely whilst doing the riding. I found the ride easy, but there were a few moments I really had to concentrate, but for the most part the roads were well sealed and not very busy. Lots of good stop points along the way and our guide was really informative. I have done tours all over Asia, and one of the most novel things happened here - we stopped to look at some wood carvers doing their trade in a road side stall, and you weren't able to buy anything! (They were doing work for someone else) So we got to stop and watch, but no pressure to buy! I also felt that at the coffee plantation, whilst purchasing was obviously desirable there was no pressure to purchase anything at all, which is not always common on tours.I didn't do the uphill bit at the end, it was really hot at that point and would probably suggest you only do it if you are in good condition yourself! (Those who did it looked pretty hot at the end of it). The lunch at the end is really good - much better than the lunch you expect to be served on a tour, with some items that weren't everywhere in Bali, such as the smoked duck.Be aware to have some spare change on you, you have the options of purchasing a range of drinks to go with lunch.Lovely people on the trip as well, I was on my own that day, so I appreciated everyone's company."

The Bali Eco Cycling company left message to the hotel receptionist but somehow the time was different in the next day morning when the shuttle arrived. I should have confirmed the pick up time by myself.All the ways were almost downhills which were pretty easy. Only me in the group fell down by accident. I may be not tall enough to ride on the mountain bike and found difficult to balance myself on some narrow roads with pieces stones . Luckily, the two guides were friendly and helpful.It was enjoyable to taste different tea and coffee. I paid extra to taste the Luwak coffee. It's worthwhile if you love coffee.They can arrange different drop off point from pick up point with extra charge. "

We then picked up our bikes for our 25km cycle which was easy going and 98% downhill so easy for any riding skill level. Our first stop was to visit a family compound of a local poor family. - we then visited the compound of a wealthy family to see the difference. We also had stops at a beautiful 500 year old tree, rice paddies where we walked in them and had the chance to cut the rice and thrash it to see the process in real time. We then ended up at a restaurant for a gorgeous lunch of smoked duck and chicken as well as a full buffet. It will be a day my boys will remember."

I could have stopped every few minutes because it was one beautiful photo op after another! In many villages children lined up to slap our hands as we rode through. As a non-biker I found the riding to be fairly easy. Breakfast and lunch are provided in attractive venues, and the food is delicious. I highly recommend this tour as a wonderful way to et outdoors and see the traditional Bali you miss in the tourist centers."

Loves using his Aussie slang! We then got our bikes and helmets, fitted and adjusted. Off we headed on our 25km ride (96% downhill). The pace was quite fast but really good. Lovely scenery. Stopped at local family compound which was an eye opener but great experience. Also stopped at rice paddies, 500 year old Bunyan tree and to have a close up experience with a local spider! Only three of our group took on the optional five km uphill, the rest of us enjoyed our cold washer and headed for lunch. Buffet lunch was so good, must try the steamed duck.

Travelling alone, it was difficult to know where to start in a new country, but thought this would be a nice taster. Kadek custom made a tour to suit my time and preferences and I wasn't disappointed. From the Mt Batur sunrise trek to the 8km (optional) uphill ride at the end of a leisurely day cycling through beautiful balinese rice paddies, hot springs, massages, temple tours, coffee tasting...this was a fantastic tour! All the guides were super friendly and knowledgable, each place I stayed was clean, well serviced, convenient and with beautiful surrounds, even the drivers were friendly and the tour itself was informative and well organised. My only negative would be to have a more detailed itinerary before the tour to know what to bring (eg bathers for hotsprings after Mt Batur) and perhaps a little more cycling. Overall though, very good value and worthwhile tour!"

The 25km may seem daunting but most of the trip is down hill and let me tell you, cycling down hills at speed is the best air con ever! There are a few stops along the way, at Rice Paddies, a traditonal compound and a lovely old tree, all of which are great and well explained by the guides. Our guide explained it was his first time leading the tour (his name was Rocky) and he was fantastic! All of the staff were very helpful and made us feel safe throughout the trip. The only disapointing factor was the long drive to the drop off point, around 2 hours from our hotel in Seminyak to the start point. Also the breakfast was extremley disapointing with flies hanging round the buffet and only 3 choices available, lunch however was lovely! Overall was one of my favourite things we did on our trip and would recomend to family and friends!"

            "review": "An Excellent Tour. I went on this tour with two friends. Friend number one had told friend number two it was only 4 or 5 kilometres, turns out friend number one only read the bit about breakfast and lunch being provided! We were picked up at our Kuta Hotel and both friends were discussing the actual distance of the ride (around 25 kms and mostly downhill) as they climbed aboard the minibus. A young chap who was already on the bus told them they'd be ok, he'd done it before and his elderly grandmother could do it. That then had them wondering if he thought they were as old as his grandmother.After picking up our guide and the others who would be in our group we headed to a plantation where we sampled a selection of teas and coffees. If you wanted to try the Luwak Coffee (aka cat-poop-cino) you could do so for an additional charge. Then it was back on the bus and up to Kintamani for breakfast. The view of Mt. Batur and the crater lake from the restaurant is nice. After a light breakfast it was back on the bus to pick up our bikes.Your are supplied with helmets and bottled water, bikes are adjusted to suit if need be and then you are off. I found that riders could ride at their own pace with the guide upfront, whom you do not overtake, and another riding at the back. Safety and well being are of the utmost importance and any problems are immediately attended to. The bus also follows as the support vehicle, so if you wish to stop cycling and get back in the bus you can do so whenever you want. There are frequent stops for photos and we also visited a family compound and a wood carver. In one village we saw people arriving for a festival which was nice to see. Our group split into two at one point, with one group carrying on to finish the 25 kms ride and the other group going on to do the harder ride which is uphill for about another 40 mins. I chose the first option. Once we'd finished our ride we were back in the bus to head to the restaurant for lunch where we were eventually joined by the other group. Once fed and watered it's back in the bus and you're taken back to your hotel. You can be dropped off in Ubud if you like but you then have to make your own way back to your hotel.The scenery is amazing, it was so relaxing cycling along under blue skies through villages and verdant green rice paddies. The roads we travelled were back roads with little or no traffic, I never felt unsafe. Our guide (Wayan) was fantastic, friendly and informative with a wonderful sense of humour and he was always checking that everyone was ok. It's a lovely day out, a great way to see the countryside and excellent value for money, I would highly recommend this tour and it's something I will do again next time I'm in Bali."

We saw a local's house and how the properties are normally laid out, we also cycled through many small villages and along some rice paddies. At the end there was an option for some more up hill cycling which we declined and drove instead to the final point where we met those that were keen on the up hill cycling"

Despite the restaurant's touristy vibe, the views are gorgeous and the food was great. After breakfast, we were delivered by van to a coffee roasting facility specializing in cevit cat coffee (coffee made from coffee beans pooped by cevit cats, which live in the local rainforest). Despite several signs boasting that \"natural\" cevit coffee beans are foraged from the forest, we learned - and saw first hand during the tour - that is not at all how the coffee is harvested. The farmers actually poach wild cevit cats from the rain forest and imprison for weeks (or longer) in miserable cages where they're fed coffee beans, to be collected after they defecate. We saw the kitties trapped in cages during our tour - see photo. This was not our idea of eco-tourism. After leaving the plantation, we spent a tremendously enjoyable afternoon cycling around the Balinese countryside with fantastic guides. This excursion would be near perfect minus the coffee plantation."

We were picked up from our resort in Ubud and driven up to Kintamani for our delicious breakfast at Lakeview Hotel overlooking Mt Batur and the lake. The view is truly amazing!Our tour guide Winia greeted us when we arrived (we had booked a private driver for the day as we were flying home that afternoon and needed to take our luggage with us, so did not use the Bali Eco car serivce) He was very friendly and welcoming and informed us that once we finished our breakfast we'd be leaving to collect our bikes!Breakfast at Lakeview Hotel was great. There was a selection of hot food, as well as vanilla and chocolate pancakes, and platters of fresh fruit. Tea, coffee and juice was also available.Once we had collected our bikes and helmets, we were provided with bottles of cold water and we set off through the scenic, quiet streets. It was all downhill riding so you barely needed to pedal, apart for 1 or 2 small inclines in the road!The first stop was the coffee plantation, where we were shown a few different plants including cinnamon and Winia explained their unique properties .He was very informative and was happy to answer any questions. We also got to try a range of teas, and coffees at the plantation which was really cool. My only feedback about this was that the drinks were made very sweet, which were just too much for my liking. One thing you wouldn't usually get to see is a real Balinese home/compund. As part of the Eco Tour you get the chance to visit and look around in one. I found this a real culture shock, and a very eye opening experience to see how Balinese people live outside the tourist and very populated areas.I also enjoyed stopping off at the Banyan tree, it was incredible! We were given bananas here as a refuelling snack and it was nice to get out of the sun for a little. Stopping at the rice paddies and getting to walk through them was also a great experience. At this point of the tour we were given the option of cycling further downhill or a more uphill option for those that wanted a bit of exercise and which was a bit longer. We chose the downhill option, as the heat was just a bit much that day! At the completion of the tour we were given ice cold facecloths to freshen up (appreciated this SO much!) and another bottle of cold water. We were then driven back to have lunch at Bali Eco's restuarant. A buffet of traditional Balinese food was served - SO delicious, including some tasty chicken skewers and you could order cold drinks, including yummy juices from their drinks menu. I thought the cycling tour was a great way to see Bali, we did a lot in a small amount of time as everything was very well planned and is a great way to experience something different and unique if you have had enough of shopping, laying by the pool etc! You do not need to be super fit to do this cycling tour as it is 99% downhill, plus the private van follows your tour group so if you do need to stop, no problem!"

Note that this is a group tour of about 10 people (i joined alone and met up with 3 other groups of people), and we had 3 local guides for the climb. The local guides spoke poor but sufficient english.The climb was not as simple as thought, mainly because the volcanic ash soil is very loose and slippery. When I was coming down, i was basically sliding down the volcano using my weight to push the soil down. This made me wonder how i even came up in the first place. The view was great up there, except that we were a little late. Its a little cold up there, so remember to grab a light jacket. For breakfast, the tour would provide you with some sandwiches/jam/boiled eggs, but you can always purchase soft drinks or food up there. The drinks are expensive up there (~Rp 30,000 for bottle of coke), but I would say try to support the locals when possible.Now for the negatives...1. We started rather late, around 4+am. The sky is already quite bright halfway through. It was so bright we didnt need the torch for the 2nd half. I believe we were one of the last few groups to get there, as the top was packed by the time we got there. Not quite sure why we were so late, perhaps it was too big a group and the bus had to go to each hotel to pick up the passengers. Or perhaps it was because we spent too long at the restaurant before the hike. Did nothing there, and had no briefing. 2. What did EcoCycling do for the trip? Essentially nothing. EcoCycling basically arranges for the transport, a 'guide', and sandwiches for the trip. After we arrive at the foot of Mount Batur, we were handed over to the '3 local guides' (those mafias you hear off), who brought us up the mountain with the sandwiches. The 'guide' did not go up with us. So essentially, you would probably do better hiring your own local guide there anyway.3. Ecocycling claimed that their tour is unique as they bring the tourist around the crater. But since the tour is not conducted by them anyway (but the local guides), its practically done by everybody anyway. More like misrepresentation on their part.4. EcoCycling tried to bring us up to the Lawak coffee plantation after the hike (probably due to commissions for the guides), but this was not inside the itinerary. I was rushing for an afternoon flight, and was promised to return back to hotel immediately after the hike (ended around 930am). This whole episode really frustrated me. Finally, for a group tour, that will be guided by the locals anyway, the price could be a little too steep. You probably be able to find better quotes elsewhere. Some solo trips could be cheaper too.I signed up for the tour, paying more than others, thinking that EcoCycling would be more reputable compared to others (hopefully better English). It greatly disappoint me given how the tour was not conducted by them, and how the guide tried to bring us to a detour in the coffee plantation."

Also:'On the way home from the trek we will stop off at a Balinese plantation to learn of the plants important to the Balinese and their culture, the process of making coffee and see some of those herbs you\u2019re used to cooking with and tropical fruits growing in their natural environment. We also get to sample of them as well as local herbal teas, coffees and the unusually processed Coffee Luwak, the most expensive coffee in the world.' - Again this wasn't actually included. However as I had already seen the plantation this didn't bother me. Just confused as why these claims are on the website when it appears they are not done or no longer done...maybe the website needs a bit updating!I've done a lot of hiking on my travels however I found this trek tricky it is certainly not 'easy'. I actually ended up watching sunrise below the summit but the views from here were still amazing. The trek itself was fast paced and very dusty so if you are like me and have any breathing issues take it at a slower pace, especially as you'll be doing this on either little or no sleep! I tried to keep up which is what caused the issue for me. The guides on this trip were all lovely and Winki our main guide his English was fantastic and he was happy to keep me company just below the summit and then got me to the largest crater to see the monkeys. Overall I found the company good to arrange this tour with however they either need to reword their website or actually do all the things they claim! It seems odd if the second and third craters are highlights of the trip and the reason they send there own guide with us is to ensure this happens yet they were not seen? But if you are happy to just doing the climb and seeing the monkeys at the first crater then these guys are good!"

The Lawaks were supposed to get fruit to eat during the day and occasional coffee beans , we were told they were released after 1 month. The animals we seen had NO food and NO water. I brought them water and even though they were terrified, they gulped it down. Everyone in our group was disgusted also. There is NO way these animals are free after one month. The two that we saw were ancient and looked very ill. I am a Vet Nurse. Cut this part out guys and you will have an amazing day trip. My Batur was fab as was the rice fields and Balinese village."

Longest pre break ever - sat there doing nothing for nearly 45 minutes while other groups left for summit. No briefing was given and they didnt even check or ask about injuries or warn that its challenging.  barely made it for sunrise while every other group was there ages before!We didnt see the other craters and we werent explained anythibg about Batur. Breakfast was basic- jam sandwiches and fruit. And tea for which we had to pay separately.We were supposed to depart for hotel at 930 but wasted another 45 mins at the same restaurant on the way out. Worse there was a detour to some coffee plantation - which sells coffee and cocoa, on the way back which wasnt on itinerary. (due to commissions earned by guides! ) only arrived at hotel after noon.

Wayan our cycling guide was an excellent leader on the day.This very reasonably priced activity was chocked full of sights and experiences. Visiting a local home and learning about family life and traditions was fascinating. The coffee plantation and walking into a rice field were a great addition to the day. The view of Lake Batur was sensational as was the complimentary breakfast and historical information on the volcano eruptions. The downhill bike ride was easy and broken up with a stop at a 500 year old Banyan tree. The optional uphill ride was tough in the heat and my bike gears weren't exactly well serviced,but those who finished it found it very rewarding. The finale lunch was the topping on the cake as we got to know our peddling group from Belgium, Saudi Arabia, France and Switzerland - swapping stories and sharing laughter after our morning adventure was an absolute delight! Thank-you Wayan and A team"

Their website also highlights how their mt Babur trekking tour is a stand out from all the rest. All I have to say is that from what we experienced, it is definitely not true. We were picked up at 2.15am and arrived at a local restaurant for a drink and toilet break before the trek started. We must have sat here for a good 45 minutes or so as every other tour group had left to start their trek. In fact, from the restaurant we could see that most groups were already half way and we were still sitting their waiting. We didn't start our trek until 4.45am.... A good 45 minutes late! This meant we had to take the \"goat track\" which was less populated but more steep. The trek is not at all easy... At least a moderate trek. Wear good climbing shoes and if you have any injuries then my advice would be to give it a miss as it would be too challenging. Luckily we were a fairly young group so we made the trek in an hour 20 mins.... Ahead of the usual 90-120minutes stipulated. But we all felt rushed to do it fast so that we could make sunrise from the top. Luckily we saw the sun rising.... However it would have been nicer to arrive at say 5.30am so you could watch the sky change colour and just chill.... Rather than arriving sweaty and rushed at 6.10am in time for a 6.15 sunrise. Once here we basically just sat for an hour. Despite their website claiming they are 'one of few who actually trek around to see the second and third crater' we did none of this. I did ask our guide and he said he would just point our the first crater to us. In fact pretty much every OTHER company trekked the rim of the volcano except us. We then descended the volcano and went home via a coffee plantation. I was HIGHLY disappointed with this company.... Absolutely no knowledge was shared throughout the seven hours we were with them. Despite not doing much on this trek, we still arrived home at 11.45 am.... 45mins later than expected so we missed our hotel breakfast. What's worse is that despite the quoted price of 480,000 pp.... When we paid the guide claimed to have no change so we essentially paid $100 australian dollars for two people to be dragged up and down a mountain with no sharing of knowledge. Breakfast is nothing special... And egg, jam sandwich and tea or coffee.... The eggs were not cooked over hot steam.... Again another claim made on their website but not held to. Mt Babur is a fantastic experience but I felt that this company really dampened our day."

Our driver was a bit late to pick us up from the hotel & only dropped us on the side road at the end but that's very minor. The breakfast was alright, but the view there was picture perfect. Lunch was one of the best we had in Bali and try their coconut mocktail, it's reaaaally yummy! The coffee plantation visit was a bonus as we were showed different teas/coffees, and had free tasting. The ride itself was very pleasant as it's mostly downhill. We stopped at in a Balinese house which was great. Unless you are a seasoned cyclist, do not do the uphill part. It is very hard even for someone that goes to the gym everyday. It gave us something to talk about but I needed a massage after that. Our guide was Jo (Katuk) and he was very friendly and talkative. We were very pleased with him. His english is surprisingly very fluent with a mimick of a 'british' accent. This tour is about US $55pp for the day and well worth it. I'd even say value for money. Jo gave us an insight of the friendly balinese culture."

Before the cycling was a visit to a volcano for breakfast and then a visit to a coffee farm. The guide explained how they separated and roasted the coffee beans, and then we got to try several different coffees and teas. They offered the luwak coffee- the world's most expensive coffee- for sale, the others were free.The cycling part of the tour was all downhill for 25 km, with the option of doing the last 8 km - all uphill, very challenging and not worth it for most riders - to the restaurant. It was fun to ride through the villages and be greeted by the local children with waves and high fives. The guide stopped us a couple times to show us a traditional family housing compound, which was informative but a little weird to be looking in their houses, and also to explain how the farmers grow and harvest the rice. The lunch at the restaurant was buffet-style and was very good."

We then traveled around Ubud picking up cyclers until after 8:30. We then began the drive to the summit of the volcano. On the way, we stopped for a photo op of rice paddies on the way. We then drove to the summit for breakfast overlooking the lake in the caldera. From there, we then drove to a coffee \"plantation\". It wasn't a plantation at all, because we saw no coffee trees. (In addition, we were shown how the beans were roasted, but we weren't shown the beans before the fruit surrounding the seeds is removed.) We saw the civit cats that process the beans for the special, $100 a pound coffee. We were served samples and for about $6 could sample the special coffee. From there we went to where we picked up our bikes. We actually began biking around noon. We made four stops on the way down: at a Balinese house, twice at rice paddies and once at a banyon tree. We finished biking and then had lunch. We arrived back at our villa around 4:30. An option for a hillier climb was offered.My bike was well maintained and the gears shifted easily. Several people complained about the bike maintenance, though. I know of two mishaps with the bikes that were the result of poor maintenance (no one got hurt or had an accident). This is a tour that could easily be done as a half day tour. I enjoyed it and am glad I did it, but it was much, much too much wasted time."

We saw others advertised around bali which were a lot dearer but would not hesitate to recommend this one. We did not see this one advertised much around bali. Breakfast location was spectacular overlooking a volcano and lake. The cycling didn't start until 11am as we were taken to a place where we were given the opportunity to try many different coffees and teas. The cycling was mostly downhill as indicated although there was an optional section at the end which was somewhat uphill. We decided not to do this. Several of our group did this although one did not complete and was picked up by our bus on the way to lunch (This did not seem to be a hassle). The paths and road used by the tour had some traffic although not much by bali standards. The total cycling time was approximately 3 hours but this included at least 3 stops including at a rice plantation, local house.A few notes though which may be helpful if you are considering this tour:- we were picked up at 6.45 from Seminyak and it wasn't until 9am before we arrived at our breakfast stop. We were glad that we had some juice before leaving our hotel. We also didn't arrive back to our hotel until 5pm. - There are differing ages of bikes, some which look a lot newer than others. The brakes on one of our bikes were not as good as they could have been, with the front one not working. The tour guide attempting to fix this and seemed to have, but then the rear brakes jammed. The guide then, without any hassle, swapped his bike with ours. At the end of the tour we were given feedback forms and encouraged to note the problems and the bike number so that it could be rectified. So overall, we were move than happy with their response and the tour."

We travelled with 3 families, so our group of 6 adults and 4 teenagers (ages ranging from 14 to 18 years) made up our own tour. We were picked up bright and early from Jimbaran by our wonderful guide, Wayda, and our adventure began. We had a light brekkie around 6am before we were picked up, which I would recommend. The bus trip was well over an hour, but Wayda chatted about Balinese life and customs, sharing some great stories about his own life, plus pointing out beautiful scenery along the way. \"Second breakfast\" was at one of the most stunning locations I have seen, overlooking Mount Agung and the crater river. Such a beautiful. peaceful place. Wayda pointed out the the village living by the edge of the crater, and related the history of the Balinese tribes and the evolution of their traditions and beliefs to what they are today. Wayda shared his knowledge of the Balinese plant and herb life, followed by coffee tasting and lots of laughs !! The bikes were all good quality and safety standards were high. The bike ride was not difficult and the visit to a local village was an experience I will never forget - very touching. I've travelled to Bali many times, but felt that this is the first time I truly experienced this beautiful place. The bike ride ended at a restaurant set in a rice field with an awesome lunch included! This day left me feeling humbled yet so grateful to have the opportunity to spend time with family and friends seeing this country and learning so much more about how the Balinese people live."

Second time back to Bali and today my partner at I did the Mt batur sunrise trek. Ten out of ten again. Awesome morning; friendly, funny guide and the view is definitely worth the walk. Just remember some decent shoes and decent jacket ( it is cold on top before the sun comes up!)"

The view from the mountain restaurant at breakfast was spectacular. Loved visiting the village house and hearing from our guide about the Balinese way of life. Loved our guide and his jokes. The only thing we didn't like was the two and half hour trip to get to the mountain from Sanur, but it was worth it."

Everything about this tour was very professional, the guide was very nice and informative, the bikes worked well and the hotel pick-up/drop-off left nothing to desire. I would recommend you to wear actual shoes since sandals or flip-flops may fall off and they were also tricky to walk in in the rise fields :D so wear shoes, I didn't! Even though, it says that this tour is suitable for all ages, I don't think that it really suits children since we drove our bikes downhill quite fast and there was some traffic on the roads. I might suggest 13 and up to be a good age-limit :) teens can do this tour. This tour is completely worth it, an amazing day :)"

We were picked up at our hotel in Ubud and, after picking up some of other couples, drove up to the volcano and had breakfast overlooking the lake. Unfortunately we didn't see the best of the views due to cloud cover.We were in a group of 8, which was a good number. We were driven to a coffee farm where we got to try several different coffees (included in the price) and also the famous Luwak coffee (for a small extra charge). Then it was off to collect our bikes.The bikes were modern and in decent working order. The ride itself was very easy, virtually all downhill (although there was an optional up hill end to the ride which we chose not to do). We rode through the countryside and villages with our 2 guides (who spoke good English), stopping at several points of interest including a family compound and some rice fields.Once the bike ride was over we were driven to have lunch which was a very nice buffet (included in the price although drinks were extra). Then we were taken back to our hotel.Overall a fun day out. Good to meet some other tourists and see a bit of the countryside. Very good price considering all that was included."

This was really fun for all of us (family with teenage kids) after being picked up at the hotel we drove up the volcano and enjoyed a wonderful breakfast (lake view) Then we visited a Luwak coffee site, which was also interesting. When we all 4 got our bikes (with a bottle of water) and helmets and cycled (or just rode) down hill. I found it really great to be more or less in the rice fields. During the tour you'll get to see the real life of Bali.Lunch was included and I must say that it was good (sorry, really nothing negative to say about this tour) The people in our group were nice and while enjoying our lunch we discussed a lot.The last part of the tour asks a bit more exertion and you're free to join. If not, the coach will bring you the restaurant. On the other hand, it's a real challenge to cycle the full tour, even if not all kilometres are down hill.This tour was guided by Joe (Ketut) who acted like a stand up comedian. This combined with proving loads of interesting information, made his performance excellent! Thanks!"

There are several companies to choose from for this style of tour, but I am so pleased we choose Bali Eco Cycling. I booked it via email while we were in Ubud and received quick responses. Very professionally run and with lots of fun. The tour guide was very informative with great English and taught us so much about Balinese culture and way of life. Breakfast overlooking the volcano, lake and largest mountain was very picturesque. Visiting the rice paddies, coffee plantation and a true family home (compound) was enlightening to say the least. Loved travelling downhill 'high fiving the kids' and watching Bali life take place as we rode past. My mum (77) has arthritis in both hands and never ridden a mountain bike, but on she got and downhill she went. Although at the back of the pack, she had a guide trailing her and the pick-up van in-case she (or any of us) needed it. I was so proud of her and the company in the way they looked after us. I would highly recommend this tour for a great day out and making memories!"

He took us into a traditional Balinese families house and also took us into a local village hall where offerings were being made for a cremation celebration that was to be held the next day. The only thing that I would comment on is the maintenance of the bikes, I had to jump off mine going down hill as the brakes were not working as they should have been. My partners bike gears just kept slipping all the time and the seat kept falling down which makes it difficult to pedal up hill. All in all though we had a fantastic day and would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for something out of the hustle and bustle of Kuta/Legian.Amanda & Adam - Bali Zen Villa"

We signed up for the Mt Batur volcano sunrise trek after reading good reviews about it on Tripadvisor, hence I feel the need to share my experience here with fellow travelers. Overall, I would say the tour went alright but I think that there is still much room for improvement for the tour before it deserves an honest good review: 1) There were 6 of us who made it up to the summit that morning while a few others gave up midway. Once we were at the top, the guide came around asking us if we wanted tea or coffee. Now, our itinerary clearly states that it includes tea/coffee. In fact, it was one of the selling points for the tour on their website, \"Our breakfast is the finest available: juice, fruit, eggs, bread, jam and tea/coffee and it is included in the price (so you won\u2019t be paying exorbitant prices for food on top of the mountain - another advantage of having our guide accompany you).\" So naturally, we ordered a cup each, it wasn't anything great just a tea bag in a cup of hot water. However, much to our dismay, our guide then told us that we had to pay Rp 25.000 each for the beverage because he bought the drinks from someone for us. May not seem much, but we all felt cheated afterward and it left a very bad aftertaste. So much for not having to pay exorbitant prices and the advantage of having an accompanying guide!2) IMO, our accompanying guide didn't really do a great job in making this an enjoyable experience for all of us. Half the time, we didn't know where he was, in fact I couldn't even remember how he looked like because we barely seen him around (except when he showed up to extort money from us for the tea and coffee). Most of the time, we were left in the company of some local guides (who I must say did a very good job in making sure we made it up and down the mountain safely), but hey, I could've just saved the money to be paid to the accompanying guide sent by the tour company and tipped the local guides more generously instead since they did all the hard work. 3) Our itinerary included a visit to a local Balinese plantation which I was looking forward to because I heard a lot about the Coffee Luwak. However, much to our disappointment, after we made it back down from the mountain we were sent straight back to our respective hotels. When I asked the accompanying guide about it, he said the plantation visit was optional and the rest of the group opted not to go for it. Of course, I wasn't too happy about it because (1) he certainly did not ask me nor my husband whether we would like to visit the plantation; and (2) by that time the rest of the group had been dropped off at their hotels so I had no way of verifying what he said was true. I have a feeling that he told the same lie to everyone within the tour group separately. Fortunately for us, the weather was glorious and we had a clear view of the sunrise, which made the whole trip worthwhile. But having said that, it was more of a matter of luck rather than good organization on the part of Bali Eco Cycling."

Despite the pickup at 1am (Nusa Dua is far from the mountain!), we felt the trip was very worth it. We made it to the mountain ~330a, and met up with 2 local guides to take us up the mountain. The hike was no joke - 2+ hours and a ~800m climb, so bring your walking shoes! But, even though the top was slightly cloudy which prevented us from seeing a perfect sunrise, it was a great way to connect with nature. After the sunrise, the breakfast provided (jam, bread, eggs, nuts, candy bar, orange juice) helped warm our bodies and give us strength for the trek back down the mountain.Would recommend this to any couples or friends traveling and looking for an early morning exercise!"

There isn't really much cycling per sey - as it is all down hill - but it is an enjoyable way to see the countryside (all on very quiet back roads too). There were a couple of stops - at a family compound and a coffee plantation - both of which were very interesting and there was no pressure to \"purchase\" anything. Our guide was genuinely keen that we learn about bali, it's people, culture and ecosystem. The two food stops were great - lunch especially was very well prepared and tasty.

I would endorse many previous trip advisor author views that this trip was a Bali highlight. We were staying in a Seminyak villa so our first challenge was sending an address to the company that they could collect us from. After six patient e mails we settled on being picked up at a well known nearby restaurant at 7am the next morning. This was because having just arrived in Bali we were yet to work out the Bali address system. We emerged from our villa at 10 to 7 to view a smiling Balinese waving at us at the end of our 100x gang. This smiling Balinese was our tour guide Joe Ketut and the driver Made. We did not realise in jumping in the van that we were about to start a tour within the tour which is experiencing the driving talents of Made and the unique Bali driving culture as he transported us on the approximately 2 hour trip to our Mt Batur breakfast destination. It was an eventful 2 hour trip which gave the nine that were in our van a greater appreciation of the Balinese driving culture which is something to behold. The patience of the Balinese people is clearly demonstrated as thousands of people, most of them on scooters, navigate their way to work. This coupled with Joe's informative insight on Bali culture provided a great start to this tour. Breakfast in the shadow of Mt Batur was another great experience not only because of the food but also because of the opportunity that was forded to us to observe Balinese people interact with their environments. I marvelled at the truck drivers in the distance hauling what I presume was volcanic sand? My wife and I developed a strong like for the black rice that they have on the menu. After breakfast we went to view how bali coffee and tea is prepared. We are not coffee drinkers but still found this part of the trip very worthwhile. After this we got to the cycle and even though I had not been on a bike for some time it was easy as! Joe took real good care of us and over the next two hours showed us part of Bali that you could never get from doing anything else. The side detours into village homes was a highlight. I hope that the company is providing some type of support to the Balinese villages that we cycled through because it is they that make this tour unique and special. Without them it would be just another bike ride.The learning about the importance of rice to bali communities and how their very existence is centred on this commodity was made very real through this first hand experience. My wife and I travel so we can have different and interesting experiences where we are able to learn about and value difference. This tour exceeded our expectations in regards to this. Once the cycle part of the tour concluded we were transported to a very pleasant lunch location. We were dropped off at our villa at approximately 4 pm. What a bargain this tour was. For approximately 90 kiwi dollars exclusive of our tip we both had a great 9 hour experience which was inclusive of two meals. Thanks Joe and Made you bought the tour alive and made it a very special experience. We will recommend this as a must do to any of our friends that travel to Bali in the future."

An early start (7am) with 2+ hours driving and we arrive at the magnificent restaurant at rice terraces where we ate well ( and good toilets), then back in the van to try out different coffees (not so exciting and spices heaps cheaper in the markets). Then on to the bikes! Bikes were pretty good but there were a few probably ready for an upgrade. Our guide, Weta (?spelling), was very knowledgable, thoughtful and on the ball. And the guide at the back who looked after the stragglers ( that would be my 10 year old and I!) was very caring. We stopped half way at a magical 500 year old banyan tree for bananas and a stretch. There are mini stops along the way. Our group elected not to ride uphill for the last few kilometres. Rather, we patted ourselves on the back for the 20 odd kilometres we'd covered (downhill, and pretty much braking all the way). Must be on holidays :)!"

We ate there a generous breakfast with this stunning view. after that we visited a coffee plantage together, having a look how coffee is being made here in Bali. They have a unique way to procedure the famous Luwak coffee. although the animals are kept poorly in a cage, only eating this coffee fruits. quiet said, and the coffee not even good. but back to the cycling, we had a fantastic tour with our guide Joey Ketut. what a laugh we had! cycling all the way down the mountain, easy for everybody. it was quiet interesting visiting the local people in their homes, watching how they work for their living etc. we enjoyed a beautiful view over the rice terrasses. the bikes are very good and everybody gets their own water. after this very exciting ride, we got invited to eat lunch, again from a bufet. very generous. a great idea for a full day outing!!"

Then a bus trip through the countryside to the Mt. Batur volcano. Next is breakfast with a spectacular view of the volcano and surrounding lake. Back into the bus for a drive to the coffee plantation. The tour guide walks you through a garden of many types of plants with medicinal and food values. Taste a variety of teas and coffee including the expensive Luwak coffee. Back into the bus for a short drive to where you select a bike then head off on a very long downhill cycle through villages and countryside. Stop off at a local village and have a guided tour through a family compound. Eye opening experience! Back on the bikes and rolling though rice fields and down tracks.It's very easy really as it is 95% downhill. You don't have to be fit to do this trip. For the hardcore riders there is a tough uphill segment which finishes the trip. Most people will finish without really raising much of a sweat. Then it's a smorgasbord lunch which, while there is plenty of food, it was one of the weaker dining experiences of my Bali stay. However the bike trip is fantastic. So good that i've done the same trip in BOTH my last two visits to Bali. Our guide on both trips was very entertaining and informative. Highly recommended."

My wife and I ambitiously booked both the Sunrise Hike at Mt Batur as well as the Cycling Tour thru the back country between Lake Batur and Ubud for one activity-filled day. And what an amazing time we had!Our guides fetched us at 230 in the morning for the hike up the volcano, we arrived there around 4 to begin the ascent. There are literally hundreds of people with various tours climbing altogether but we didn't find it crowded. Our guides were led by ROCKY who was just terrific. His English was great and he knew a lot about the region and volcano as well. He even makes a mean banana sandwich.The sunrise is well-worth the exertion. Note however, they say this is a hike suitable for Beginners however we both feel this is intermediate for most people. We consider ourselves pretty physically fit and still found this hike challenging. Maybe it's because your ascent is in pitch black darkness. ;)After our descent, they dropped us off at the LakeView Hotel to meet up with the cycling tour. Here we met our guide AGUS who proved absolutely invaluable. He was knowledgeable, friendly and warm with spot-on English skills and enthusiasm about sharing Balinese life with us.The tour takes you thru some incredibly idyllic Balinese countryside and you see sights you certainly won't find in Central Ubud. All in all this was our favorite day so far of over a week of incredible days. If you're even a little bit in shape, don't shy away from combining these two great tours, you won't be disappointed."

For a few hours we cycled 25 km downhill through the beautiful landscape and stopped at the house of a traditional Balinese family. Optional was the ascending uphill; 8 kilometers which made us sweat like we were attending a spinning class. Bring a spare t-shirt!

I have done this cycling tour from Mt Batur lower to upper Ubud four times now and it never falls short of my expectations. This is a very professional group (and I have been on other one) and the guides are clearly interested in the people and enjoyment of their charge. Today I did it for the first time with my young family (7 year old twin boys and my wife) and having done it previously I knew that they would cater well for my children. They had appropriately sized bikes (bigger and smaller also) and the support vehicle was always close if we needed to let them ride in the bus behind the group if required. They could change bikes immediately also if something went wrong with the bike. We also had other 2 other families with young kids in our group of 12 so we all sort of looked out for each other. It was nice that they matched up the group for the families so we didnt feel pressured to keep up and push our kids. One of my boys rode on the tandem bike even though he didn't need to to for skill he enjoyed the experience. That was a long day for the guide I bet.My family is gluten free so they specially catered Indo food for them in the restaurant at the completion of the ride, and informed us that the pancakes at their Lakeview restaurant were made on rice flour so we were really happy. The food in general is great and the staff very supportive. The Luwak Coffee plantation stop is good and the other intermediate stops are also really informative. I loved the Cocoa fresh from the pod if you can organise one. I learnt a lot about rice farming and family compounds whilst on this tour."

The breakfast at Mt Batur was brilliant and informative and although we didn't expect much out of the visit to the coffee plantation it was actually much more enjoyable than we expected. We than started cycling. We had a stop to look at a compound of traditional Balinese houses and a stop to look at a rice paddy being harvested by locals who seemed to appreciate our presence. Both stops were accompanied by an explanation from a guide who was clearly very very knowledgeable. The cycling itself was such good fun and high-5'ing the local kids in villages was a particular highlight.A word about the setup. They have a support vehicle following at all times and we were really grateful for this as my wife fell ill on the day of the tour and the guides were very supportive and helpful as she was clearly struggling. She didn't need the support bus in the end as she soldiered on and finished the course on her bike but we were very glad it was there...I put that the tour is good for those short on time as you see so much in a day that I would highly recommend this to someone who needs to get out of somewhere like Kuta or Sanur to see a different side of Bali but doesn't have much time to do it..."

After our pickup from Seminyak we were driven to Kintamani where we had a very tasty breakfast in a beautiful venue with a view to Mt Batur and Lake Batur. We loved being out in the open air and experiencing the real Bali lifestyle as we cycled our way past rice paddies, villages and coffee plantations. The stops along the way at a Hindu family compound, rice paddies and a coffee plantation were informative and interesting. Lunch, also was delicious, in a great local venue. Would definitely recommend this tour for fun, the cultural experience and great value for money. Because the bike helmuts provided are worn by previous riders, we took a disposable cap to protect our hair from the sweaty, previously worn helmuts."

We were also aloud to walk through the rice fields in our small breaks. The coffee plantation was also excellent and was a great way to incorporate that into our day! You can also buy coffee Lewa at the shop at the plantation for about $30. Make sure you buy the powdered coffee otherwise you won't be allowed to bring it back with you. If you buy the bean coffee packets then customs won't let you bring it back with you. They said something about bugs being in the beans or something but if it's powdered it's fine and has no bugs.

Their english was pretty good and they helped people all the way to the top, in a kind, funny and lovely way. They were all gorgeous.But overall we got hardly what we paid for.The website said that the mountain ''is not difficult to climb at all''. That's the first thing we massivly disagree with right away. You need to be healthy, fit and have proper trekking shoes, otherwise you'll seriously hurt yourself like a few people along the way who were wearing sandals or sneakers. If u have a heart condition or asthma don't do it, you won't make it to the top.So much about them saying ''very easy to climb''.The website says also '' very easy to climb for children.DO NOT take your children, unless they're teenagers. Its pitch black when you start climbing and very slippery, the torches were not helpful since u had to hold them and couldnt use both hands to hold on to rocks. Its also freezing cold so make sure you got a warm fleece ready to wear when you get to the top. ''Our breakfast is the finest available: juice, fruit, eggs, bread, jam and tea/coffee''Unfortunately we got dissapointed again.We got two slices of toast with banana in between, a boiled egg and peanuts. No fruit, not bread for jam, no jam. Tee and Coffee was available.We got also promised by the website that unlike other companys they would walk us all way around the whole rim of the vulcano, showing us the second and third krater as well.Which did not happen!The website says:''we will stop off at a Balinese plantation to learn of the plants important to the Balinese and their culture, the process of making coffee and see some of those herbs you\u2019re used to cooking with and tropical fruits growing in their natural environment. We also get to sample of them as well as local herbal teas, coffees and the unusually processed Coffee Luwak, the most expensive coffee in the world.This didn't happen either.Which disapointed us very much since we were especially looking forward this. We were tiered, angry, upset and hungry when we got back.We paid 480.000 Idr for this and we had better experiences for much less than that.Very disappointing and I wouldn't recomment booking a tour with them.The website gives obviously a completely different view on this tour, promising everything and keeping nothing."

Frequently a stop is being made to take a closer look at e.g. rise harvesting (you are invited to help the locals), a coffee plantation, a Balinese house, etc. The guide spoke English well and gave a lot of information. The interaction with the local people is remarkable: everybody is happy to see tourists, even if they don't have anything to sell. Definitely a recommendation. I booked directly, but was told that if you book via an intermediate party (taxi driver?) you can get a discount. I payed 420.000 IDR. Breakfast and lunch was included. The only physical thing about this bike tour are your hands: you need to brake nearly all the time."

We are a family of 4 and one of my twins is recovering from a broken knee. Bali Eco got us a tandem bike with a small foot hold for him and the guides assisted my son and made sure he was having a good time the entire day. My other 9 year old had his own kid's bike. I felt extremely safe with the guides navigating us through small villages and along beautiful rice paddies. This is a must-do with kids!"

At the end we said we could do it 10 times over, it was amazing.The food was great, they were super accommodating.Quick replies with bookings, un heard of in Australia!!When we return to bali we will definitely be doing it again.This side of bali is completely underestimated, we all walked away feeling happy and great full.

We did this tour on our first day in Bali, and it was incredible!We were picked up early in the morning, at our hotel by our guide (who was amazing! very helpful, informative, friendly) and driver. We were in a group of 10, with people touring from literally all around the globe. The day started with breakfast overlooking Mount Batur. Next we went to a coffee/tea tasting, where we had the opportunity to try the world-famous Luwak coffee. And then finally around 10, we begun our down-hill ride! Along the way we stopped at a traditional Balinese house where we got to learn more about the culture; next at a paddy field where we got to watch the entire cultivation process, and even lend a helping hand! Our final rest stop was at a beautiful 500 year old banyan tree.At the end of our ride we were driven to an amazing lunch with delicious Indonesian/Balinese food.Luckily our day was not too hot, but the humidity was still pretty high! We were provided lots of water, and some fruit on our last break to keep us going.The whole ride had a lot of opportunity for photos in some beautiful spots. The roads we took were pretty quiet and we felt quite safe.Highly recommended, great value for money; definitely the highlight of our time in Ubud!"

We were a group of 8 and we were accompanied by 3 guides, which was great as having more guides meant that they could cater to our different fitness levels. They were all very helpful in making sure we ascended and descended safely. Torches and water were provided. Chocolates were given to us during the climb, hot drinks while waiting for sunrise (a lifesaver, as it was rather cold at the summit), and a simple breakfast of eggs & bread with bananas after the sunrise. Needless to say, we were well fed!Tip: The climb is a rocky one so it may not be easy for everyone (unlike what is advertised on the website). But this is a must if you enjoy outdoor activities!"

We were collected on time(!) from our hotel in Ubud, there were 12 of us on the tour - a really good size as we got to know our fellow tourists from all over the world - Ireland, Canada, New Zealand and Belgium! We started with a buffet breakfast at a restaurant overlooking Lake Batur - the views were spectacular and the food was quite tasty, lots of different things to choose from. From there we were to a coffee/tea plantation and learnt about how coffee and vanilla are grown and about the civet cats from which they make Luwak coffee. 24 tastings in all! Then we headed off to collect our mountain bikes, helmets provided. We cycled downhill for about 30kms, stopping to look at workers in the rice paddies and how rice is cultivated, then got to look through a traditional Balinese compound and learn about their culture. Drinks and fruit were provided throughout the morning. We finished off with a fantastic buffet lunch. Am very pleased that the ride was downhill all the way, with the Balinese heat! We weren't on busy roads so felt safe at all times and the road was a gentle decline, not too step so never had to worry about getting up too much speed and losing control! When we finished we were given nice cold, wet facecloths to freshen up - fantastic idea! Our guide, Bagus, was very friendly, helpful, knowledgeable and informative, safety conscious, and had a great command of the English language. Likewise, our driver (sorry, I don't think I ever got his name) was really good and we always felt safe. I would highly recommend Bali Eco Cycling - we had a fantastic day out with them!"

We had picked this company because they were able to provide baby seats and helmets for our kids (aged 1 and 3). We got picked up on time from our hotel, had breakfast at a restaurant overlooking lake Batur, then picked up our bikes and started riding. The ride is really gentle and it was very easy even with the extra weight of the kids in the back The road had very little traffic. We did a few stops and although we had spent some time in bali by then, we certainly learned something from our guide's explanation. We finished at a restaurant where an excellent buffet lunch was provided. My only comment would be on the bikes, they were quite worn out. Everyone got to choose their bikes from a pool of bikes before departure, but as the baby seats were already fitted we didn't get to choose. My boyfriend's bike had a broken spoke during the ride, and there was no replacement bike available. So the guide gave him his bike and sat in the van. This was well managed by the guide, however given the condition of the bikes I would recommend that they either carry a spare one or that they leave it at someone's place half way so that it can be picked up if needed. Good to know: the tour price includes a ticket to the Monkey forest."

We were picked up from our Nusa Dua Hotel, collected a few more happy travellers along the way and then headed off to the Lakeview Restaurant overlooking Lake Batur for a great breakfast. Then it was on to a coffee plantation to learn about local coffees, herbs and spices and to enjoy a huge range of coffees including Kopi Luwak (the Civet cat poo coffee) which really was very smooth and delicious. Then on to collect our mountain bikes for the downhill run through quaint villages, rice paddies and stunning scenery to the tour company's own restaurant for a wonderful Balinese banquet. Joe, the English speaking guide was extremely knowledgeable and funny as a fit - he could easily give up tour guiding and go on the stand up comedy circuit.There were just so many fantastic sights along the way including a visit to a family compound to get an insight into just how rural Balinese families live and a completely unexpected temple re-blessing ceremony that had the entire village population dressed up and involved, closing the village main street for nearly an hour.The experience was fantastic and the cycling very manageable - so don't hesitate, just do it!"

We drove to Ubud where we were supplied with water and torches and met our trek guide Nyoman. Together, our group of 4 (my husband, our two sons aged 13 and 9 and myself), Rocky (our English speaking guide) and Nyoman began our trek in the darkness up the side of the volcano. The trek was pretty easy going at first, but about half way up it started to get steep. The last 45 mins provided the challenge as in the darkness the ground was rocky and steep. Nyoman and Rocky afforded us many rest breaks to catch our breath and have a drink. Our children found the trek easy and it was only my husband and myself who had to push ourselves a little! We made it to the crater in plenty of time to see the sunrise and were given steaming hot coffee, delicious peanuts, boiled eggs, banana sandwiches and chocolate to refuel our bodies. We watched a breathtaking sunrise over an incredible setting before we began to explore the crater. Other trekkers chose to continue approximately 100 metres to the absolute summit for the rim walk, but our guide explained that the ground was loose and slippery and not particularly safe for younger hikers and we appreciated that our children's safety was of such importance to the company. Instead, we explored the steam vents and ventured a little way into the crater. Our guide Nyoman was mindful of our children's safety the entire time and Rocky was knowledgable and informative about the region and its history and culture. I found it a spectacular trip to experience, and something that has created a beautiful memory for my family- standing at the summit of a volcano watching the sun break over the world!. Our tour guides and driver were fantastic. We met other tour guides on this trek who operate for this company and found them to be excellent as well. The trip down was quick and easy and we were rewarded with a cool juice and a comfortable trip home. We were back at the hotel by 10 am and still able to enjoy another full day of our holiday! This was a fantastic way to spend our day and a unique experience to add to our travel diary. I highly recommend the trip to anyone looking for an active holiday experience- don't forget to bring your camera for some spectacular sunrise shots!"

Our guides were friendly and knowledgeable. The equipment was fairly well worn. My gears tended to stick, for instance. The ride wasn't very demanding, though, so our bikes worked fine for what we had to handle. I will say for folks that are shopping that there are a lot of companies that do similar tours.

Around 11am you'll get to your bikes and as the other reviewers have stated, check your gears and brakes well before setting off. It is all downhill, I had to pedal maybe three times, but there is an optional longer tour uphill at the end and you'll suffer if your gears aren't working properly.

The breakfast overlooking Mt. Batur was just perfect, and the tea/coffee samples at the plantation were plentiful. The guide's explanations as we visited the traditional Balinese home, the rice terrace, and the Banyan tree were fantastic.

It is great to see this rural aspect to local life in Bali. The quality and assortment of food at both breakfast and lunch was great, certainly above my expectations. Both lunch and breakfast are in restaurants rather than in a private house environment (possibly reduces the chance of eating something that does not agree with you??). My bike was in good condition, this is because I looked though the bikes and chose that one specifically. I requested the tyres be pumped up a little which was fine, one of the gears jumped a little but really who cares!! The up hill at the end was not too difficult and a nice way to finish before lunch. The only down side (and this is not the fault of Bali Eco) but as we were staying in Nusa Dua we were collected first (we were told 06:30, I was down stairs at 05:30 and driver was waiting) we then had 1 pick up in Sanur and another three in Ubud. On the way home in the afternoon the traffic around Ubud and Denpasar was at a standstill (as it always is) so it was close to three hours in the bus to get back to the hotel. With this in mind if you are thinking of this tour, and I would highly recommend that you do, if you are staying in multiple areas book it when you are staying closest to Ubud."

You visit the coffee plantation, have breakfast overlooking Mount & Lake Batur which was beautiful and a fantastic photo opportunity. Then you are driven to the starting point of the cycle tour and although some of the bikes had seen better days, they were all functioning and perfectly adequate for the kind of cycling we did. There was nothing strenuous and all ages can do it, just as long as you can ride a bike! Most of it was flat or downhill, so I spent more time coasting than I did actually cycling which was perfect for me! We stopped a couple of times to take photos, to see the Banyan Tree and visit a family compound (this is a series of houses where each family unit lives along with the wider family, sharing a family temple and ceremony spaces - a very traditional way to live in Bali). At the finish point you are then driven to have lunch which was delicious. If you wanted to do more cycling, you could choose to cycle the last bit to lunch, but it would be up hill and more strenuous from what we heard!Definitely a trip worth doing if you want to get off the beaten track and experience the beautiful scenery outside of a car!"

It is also fun and easy as there is a good mix of ages ( I am 64 and I saw some teens in other groups ) , genders and origins . The normal tour is all downhill with about 3 kms of trail in the rice fields, the remaining portion being on pavement but it is possible for people to replace the non paved portion by one on pavement and for the athletic persons to finish the tour with an 8 kms uphill portions .  The guided portions are quite interesting and our own guide was in fact a farmer living and working in the area ! I found the food at breakfast to be excellent and quite different from what I got at my hotel and the buffet after the ride was o.k. !  We were picked up at our hotel at 8.00 hrs and dropped back at 17.00 hrs ; it was a long and very interesting day ! And by the way , we never felt insecure cycling on these rural roads as the traffic was slow and cautious !"

I learned so much about Bali on this tour as well as witnessing some great scenery, my wife was a little concerned as she is not a great bike rider and some of the roads in Bali are a little crazy, but it was no problem as the tour tracked along the quiet back roads (we saw other bike tours whilst in Bali following some very busy roads!) The tour itself crams loads of different stuff in, the breakfast and lunch was very good food also. Overall my favorite activity in Bali!"

Booked Bali Eco Cycling for a sunrise trek on Mount Batur after a private trek organized by my hotel increased in price (I was travelling alone) and I am so glad I joined Bali Eco. A private trip on Mount Batur would be a waste of money as it is such a popular excursion there is no privacy to be had on this mountain walk you might just as well be in a group. I was glad of the company to be honest and joined 3friends from India and Singapore and a couple from Australia, 6 of us in total and we were accompanied by 4guides! The level of care was fantastic...we were a mixed ability group and so with the number of guides we had that meant we could all walk at our own pace without worrying about being too fast for/or slowing down other members of the group. The guides were very attentive and informative without being a bore...telling us the history of the eruptions, pointing out plants and herbs along the way and also swapping personal stories of our very different lives...truly a walk with friends. Breakfast on the top, expertly and kindly served by the guides, before trekking down. A great walk, expertly guided and the best price of all I could find (I would go as far to say it is too cheap for the level of service they give). I didn't do their cycling trips but chatting to the guides about them they sound fantastic, so on my next trip one of the cycling trips will be a must do for me for sure."

Bicycles are quite good; with suspension and all. Helmets are provided as well. Important thing about this cycling is.... you must know how to brake haha... hardly any cycling is required as its mainly downslope so you just need to press your brake hard, harder hardest.At least 2 guides are with the group at any time. 1 to lead the group and 1 at the back to ensure no one is left behind. There is a van following as well.Banana is given half way through the cycling to replenish energy as well.At 1 time, I fell (through my own clumsiness) and they actually have a first aid kit on 1 of the guides with all the necessary equipment. So they are really well-prepared.Lunch is fantastic. Totally love the sambal chili. Best meal I had in Bali!Strongly recommend all to go for it."

We left very early in the morning because we are lodged in the south but the landscape made it worth to wake up. We got to see a traditional village in a normal day, rice terrace, a balinese family, tasted a series of coffee and teas and had fun going downhill, so no great effort. I would have liked to stop more on the road because there were many wonderful landscapes, just to take photos. In the end there is an optional uphill part which is really difficult because of the big slope. I enjoyed it very much but my husband regretted not having taken the car with the others. The breakfast on the mountain is really nice, both meals have been very good and we also got free tickets to see the monkey forest in ubud, so very good value for money."

Having joined some cycle tours in other parts of Asia we were keen to try one in Bali as they are a fantastic way of seeing the local way of life up close, and we chose Bali Eco Cycling based on the reviews on Trip Advisor. Pros:- breakfast on the crater overlooking Mt Batur and the lake was fantastic; food was good and the views were stunning. - Bikes were reasonable quality. - Visit to the family compound was interesting as was cycling through the villages and learning about the harvesting of the rice. - Guide was good and informative.Cons:- we were in a relatively large group plus there were other groups cycling the same route as us and we kept converging on the same spots (e.g. Rice paddies, banyan trees), although I suspect that is simply because Bali Eco Cycling is a large and popular outfit. - More time spent in the van than cycling."

But I was late by 15-20minutes and they waited for me. They later went on to pickup 6 others from other parts of Bali.The pickup vehicle was quite spacious. Everyone carried a small bagpack and everyone could sit and recline comfortably even after keeping their bags. I managed to get some sleep on my way.ArrivalWe arrived at the base around 2:30. We started the trek around 3. We arrived with only one guide, but the trip organiser hired another 2 guides to ensure that we have 1 guide per 3 pax. The trek:The trek was well organised. They gave us drinking water and torches for easy navigation. The guides were always leading us and we proceeded in groups. Each group had flexibility to move as fast or as slow they would want to. I could use my camera to click a few nice snaps while trekking up. The guide would wait for me. We could take breaks and the guide was carrying water bottles for us which they would give to us when we needed them.The sun rise:We arrived at the sunrise spot dot on time and it was an awesome experience. Then we were given an option to trek further or stay at that point. I and another couple decided to go further and one of the guides accompanied us. The view from top was awesome and it was worth it.Breakfast:They offered breakfast- bread-butter-jam-bananas... This was quite filling and re-energising... they offered us coffee and tea as well... Then we starting trekking down... There too they offered us some snacks and nuts... The price and payment:The price was trek was reasonable and we had options of paying via cash or card... The payment was to be done only after the trek..."

            "review": "Fantastic fun! Suitable for all the family! Great scenery & insight into Balinese culture.. We did the Bali Eco Cycle Tour on our recent trip to Ubud with our 2 children aged 8 & 9yo. It was a wonderful fun day and we have vowed to do it again on our return trip to Ubud next year! The tour started with a pickup from our hotel, a sightseeing stop enroute to breakfast at Kintamani, a short drive downhill to a coffee plantation, followed by the 25km Eco Cycle tour (which included a couple of sightseeing stops including a local village to learn about Balinese culture), and a late lunch at the end of the cycle before being driven back to the hotel. We were picked up at 7.45am, and arrived back at the hotel just before 5pm.Pros- fun guides - speak English well and very knowledgable about Balinese culture (one leads the way, another pulls up the rear)- bus follows you throughout the tour in case someone is unable or doesn't want to continue riding- less hot & humid in the mountains so the riding conditions are actually very pleasant compared to coastal Bali or Ubud - well-maintained & good quality bikes, generally good range of sizes- helmets are generally clean & not smelly!- ponchos provided if it rains- the breakfast stop at the Lake View Restaurant in Kintamani was lovely - amazing views, clean restaurant with very good toilets compared to other restaurants in Kintamani used by other tour companies- easy route, mostly downhill, suitable for kids & non-fit adults as there is very little pedalling involved- the Village tour was excellent - we learnt a lot about Balinese culture, tradition and their standard of living - a real eye-opener for our children!- great buffet lunch with your cycle group at the end of the tour - drinks could be purchased separately at reasonable prices- can pay with cash, or credit card at lunchCons- long car trip, on winding roads - not great for those prone to motion sickness (we seemed to wind around the roads of Ubud for an hour dropping others off before we finally made it back to our hotel as the last to be dropped off - I was feeling very green by that stage!)- early start but by the time you pick everybody up you don't actually start physically cycling until late morning- the weather can change very quickly in Bali - we started the cycle tour with crystal clear sunny skies, and by half way through we had the heaviest downpour of rain we had seen in all of our 11 trips to Bali!! It was actually fun cycling through the rain though - a very novel experience because the rain is warm, and when you stop cycling and put your feet on the ground, you are ankle deep in warm water! It certainly didn't deter us - our entire group kept cycling even though we were offered by our guides on several occasions to be driven in the bus.- the tour is predominantly downhill so you spend most of your time applying the brakes and very little time doing any pedalling. By the end of the 24kms, I felt like I needed some exercise, but because of the wet weather and the fact that we were pretty drenched despite our ponchos (no amount of wet weather gear will protect you from the downpour we got caught in!) I decided to take the bus the last 8kms to lunch instead.Overall, the Bali Eco Cycle tour was excellent fun and we look forward to doing it again next year!"

I was really surpised to read a negative review of this tour - we have nothing but praiseBreakfast overlooking the lake and Mt Batur was spectacular and we also enjoyed the coffee plantation. Samples ( at least a dozen!) were suplied as one tray between two and we didn't mind sharing, but they also brought extras for the single people. Some of the teas in particular were really delicious. All the luwaks seemed comfortable ( and mostly asleep, being nocturnal) but there was plenty of fruit available for them - they certainly weren't being force fed coffee beans! The demonstrations of sorting and processing were interesting, and althogh the fruit samples were supplied outside the shop, there was no pressure to buy.On to what we were supposed to be doing - next we chose our bikes - all seemed in reasonable condition and our guides took us through a safety check. Helmets were supplied but hardly anybody used them! It was a good tip from the brochure to take a cap to wear under the helmet.We cycled mostly downhill through lots of villages and I actually found the pace a bit too fast to look properly at things, whilst avoiding jaywalking dogs and children, potholes, and people winnowing their rice or mending a thatch roof - in the middle of the road! Our guide, Agus was very entertaining and informative all day but especially when taking us to a famity compound and explaining the family hierarchy and customs.The next stop was a rice paddy and finally a huge strangler fig, where those who wanted to cycle the 8k uphill to the restaurant took off in an alternate direction. The rest of us continued on downhill and ended up crossing a river over a very narrow bridge to find the bus waitng in on the other side. Cold towels and drinks all round and then on to the restaurant.Lunch was excellent - and the beers were welcome!We were changing hotels that day from Ubud to Kuta and there was no problem being picked up at one with our luggage, and deposited at the other. A flat tyre in the middle of Denpasar was quickly fixed, although the bald one that came off made me feel a bit uneasy about all the high windy roads we had just travelled!Full marks for a great day - and especially to Agus who made it that bit better still"

            "review": "Mt Batur. We got picked up around 1:30 AM from Sanur and it was a long, dark drive to get to the station in Ubud (which is already high in elevation). Some people were cold but we found it comfortable, especially as we began climbing. As we headed towards Mt Batur, we were in a cloud, which we climbed above within 30 minutes or so. At this point, the climb became gradually steeper but the guides would take a break whenever anyone asked (if some people found it too difficult to keep up, one of the guides would accompany them separately).When we left the clouds, the sky became crystal clear and covered in stars. It was beautiful! The flashlights given to trekkers are small LEDs, enough to light up the path but not enough to affect the brightness of the night sky. Meanwhile, you see a constant line of white dots from the flashlights as hundreds of people climb the mountain (that was the biggest drawback: too many people).As we reached the second station from the top, the guides offered hot chocolate, coffee, tea, chocolate, etc. Meanwhile the sky was beginning to get lighter. As we reached the top, which is semi-circular because of the crater, the sun came up casting light over the surroundings and the crowds. It was a bit tough to get a picture without every bumping in and so forth. Fortunately, this could easily be escaped by walking out around the crater, where most people are too tired to go. Another advantage is that the northernwestern foothills, which are not visible from the main, southerneast side, are really beautiful and mostly untouched. I am allergic to peanuts so unfortunately I was not able to eat breakfast but we were able to feed the macaques. They were large but relatively docile unless threatened. The only trouble I encountered was when I accidentally scared the dominant male who made a brief rush at me. There's also a big cave and hot springs around the central crater.The descent was faster than the ascent but quite a bit riskier. Slipping was a hazard but the guides, always helpful, even held our backpack for us the entire descent (which helped a lot!). This part of the journey is also a lot more scenic: we only realized that we had been walking along Batur Lake during the descent.After we left the valley surrounding Batur, the drivers asked us if we wanted to go to the coffee plantation. We agreed, unfortunately. It was entirely unremarkable. We were tired. The luwacs (small mammals) that are used in the manufacturing of coffee are locked up in terribly unhumane conditions. They are forced to eat coffee beans, which naturally form only a small portion of their diets. After this, we were offered free coffee smaples, that are shared in the same cup by everyone (no thanks...). I actually fell asleep at this point (we didn't want to go into the shop or otherwise support the plantation). When I awoke, everyone was ready to go back, which we did happily. Then it was a 2 hour ride back to Sanur, which I wished everyone had done before. Don't do this part but Mt. Batur is well worth the amount!"

I have done a similar cycling tour before on a previous trip to Bali, but this one was far superior.For starters, the breakfast place you go to is a lovely, quaint building with good facilities and the children thoroughly enjoyed the pancakes, etc. we were fortunate on the day we went as the weather was crystal clear, and the view was simply stunning.We were then driven further down the hill to collect the bicycles, there was a choice of around 100, so all the children ended up with the right size bike...phew! And off we went, zipping down the hills. It was lovely to stop at the rice paddies and our guide showed our children how to make some flying rocket thingies out of the blades of the rice, this is what he used to play with as a child.Next stop was a traditional house, and we enjoyed seeing the pigs and cows, etc. Downwards again, next stop a Banyan tree and a break for a banana (though I was still full from breakfast!) we all took turns walking through the \"cave\" in the tree.At the end of the tour my husband opted to take the uphill section whilst we travelled by mini-bus to the restaurant. They provided vegetarian dishes for me, on top of the buffet, which really wasnt necessary as there were enough options in the buffet (tempeh, tofu, etc). The lunch was delicious and went down well with a few cold Bintangs!On the way home we opted to stop at the coffee plantation, which was fun and we didnt feel any pressure at all to purchase anything. Did feel a little sorry for the Luwaks though in their little cages.All up, we all enjoyed this tour very much and I would recommend it to all. Yes, its touristy, but it's a TOUR people, its kind of meant to be touristy!!"

No money in that though.Lunch was good but because you end at their own restaurant you dont get to cycle some of the nicer roads close to UBUD.At lunch we had i think it was 12 groups of 11 riders all doing the same tour on the same road and so you can see their is nothing ECO about it. This is big business and nothing more.Hire a car or scooter and do it yourself. You will see SO much more.A scooter for a day is $5. This tour is $45.Even if it was free i wouldnt do it again."

The bikes varied slightly in condition and possibly a few need replacing sooner rather than later, but all were safe. The cycling was mostly down hill. Only about 500m-1km of pedalling was actually required over the 25km cycle. Transport was included in the cost and was well maintained air conditioned and clean. Finally the food from breakfast at Kintamani to Lunch in Ubud was superb. Overall a great day out and I highly recommend everyone visiting Bali makes the effort and does a trip."

Planning my second day in Bali as a solo traveler, I was looking for a social activity that would help me escape the Kuta and Legian scene. A coworker of mine had done the Eco Cycling Tour so I gave it a whirl. I rang up the number on their website and it was as easy as chatting with a fellow to make all reservations. Sure enough right the at the designated time the bus arrived at my hotel in Kuta. The bus ride alone is a nice chance to be a voyeur and watch island communities go by. Stop by stop the bus filled up as we clawed our way up to breakfast point which overlooks a stunning volcano and lake. The van was quite full and most of us were a bit groggy given the early pickup. It's a solid 2 hr drive I'd say from pick up to the breakfast point so some may want to keep the Ipod or book handy. Our guide was very personable. He was truly local in the sense that when we our group was cruising down the hill on the 25km downhill ride, we were going through communities that were very close to the village where he was from.At the breakfast restaurant which was at \"the top\" of the excursion as I could tell, there was ample time for included food, taking panoramic photos, and using the toilet facilities. Afterwards we drove a short distance (I presume downhill) to an area where the bicycles were staged for us. We donned our helmets and then met our other guide who for the most part rode at the back of the pack to keep us together. My single biggest complaint would be that some of the bikes on the tour were pretty tired. Of course, I understand these hardy machines get used and run hard by strangers on a daily basis in all types of weather. But on a few occasions chains fell off during brief portions where uphill peddling was required (outside of the optional 8km uphill ride at tour's end). My bike was matte grey, but the newer ones were blue and white and have functioning front shocks. Get a blue and white bike if you can. The ride itself was a joy because of course with brief exceptions it was downhill. We were rode as a widely spread out pack. Some really were riding the brakes the whole way down. Nonetheless, our guide at the rear was patient (i was behind one such slow rider) and he never complained our hustled anyone along. The van which contained all our belongings was trailing us the whole time. It was comforting to see the van was always ready for us. Along the way we made a few stops for exposure and lectures about the communities we were passing through. Our group toured a family compound and saw the daily rituals of a family that are weavers. We saw a wedding procession as well. AMazingly, this group pulled off it safely so kudos to Bali Eco for keeping things safe in spite curvy roads and a plethora of scooters buzzing around. Vigilance is required on the roads, as it's easy to become a bit dazed by the splendor of rice paddies and lulled into the downhill riding pace. All in all it was a great way to really connect to the outside community and this world that is so different from the life most tourists will see in their resort or urban zones of Bali. Not to mention it's just plain stunning peacefully meandering through the rice fields.At the end of the downhill portion a few of us elected to ride with one of the guides on an uphill portion of about 8 kms. Honestly, the ride was pretty easy and nothing to be feared. Just make sure to pick a good bike with a nice seat and good shifting if you do so. Yes, the ride was uphill but for the most part it was a constant gradient which made things easier once the pace was set. At the end of the uphill trek we were treated to a fantastic lunch set in a rather large covered \"gazebo\" of sorts that was situated in a rice paddy. The food was excellent. Beverages such as soda and beer were an extra cost, otherwise all else was covered. Not long after our group arrived the skies opened and a downpour of rain came along. It was quite a memorable sight to be enjoying a meal after a sweaty ride while the peaceful sound of rain surrounded us.I would highly recommend Bali Eco for this excursion. Your day will be organized and structured which is nice lets face it when on holiday. But the whole affair feels like casual tourism which I think is just the point. The educational portion is highly insightful and trust me I'll never look at eating rice the same after seeing the back breaking work that is involved in its production. The organization is professional and I would consider the bike tour a top highlight of my visit to Bali."

Our driver \"Wack\" picked us up on time and was a fabulous tour guide for the 2.5hr drive to breakfast, pointing out things along the way and telling us all about the election which was on that day (and was clearly a very exciting day for the Balinese people). Breakfast overlooking the volcano was good - the banana pancakes definitely recommended!). Then it was off to a coffee plantation where we tried different teas and coffee's (including the infamous Luwak coffee). Then onto the main event, our bikes! We cycled through little Balinese villages and towns which you just can't see on the normal tourist tracks. A can't remember our guides name but he was very knowledgeable, telling us all about Balinese customs and answering all of our questions. After the 25k's downhill we got the opportunity to ride uphill for another 8ks. This was a loooong 8ks for those of us who took on the challenge! You definitely need to be fit if you're going to take this last option!Lastly onto lunch, which we certainly needed by then! Yummiest Mei Goreng I had all trip, and loved the 'powerade water' inclusion on the drinks menu, a great way to replace the electrolites we sweated out on that last 8ks!I would HIGHLY recommend this tour and company to anyone who goes to Bali, my only criticism was the bus we were picked up in was clearly quite old and the air conditioning was no good, so by the time we got back to our villa at the end of the trip we were stinking hot and it was quite an uncomfortable trip home. Only thing that stops me giving this tour a 5 star review."

Whilst an important and enjoyable part of this tour, it is not all about cycling or coasting to be more accurate! The scenery is stunning, the stops interesting, the people welcoming and the knowledge shared is fascinating. We particularly enjoyed actually seeing rice growing up close and at all stages from planting to harvesting. I cannot believe how much skill, effort, time and dedication it takes to get a 30kg sack of rice. Our bikes were fine - not new but the brakes worked and as this is almost all down hill, that was the most important.Don't choose this tour if you want to cycle all day, but 25 kms downhill in two and a bit hours with all the other visits was a good balance for us. Buffet lunch at the end was tasty and our guide was attentive all day long. We were so pleased that we listened to our friends who encouraged us to take this tour. We would encourage our friends to do it too!!"

I'm fairly sure that rolling down the side of a hill on a mountain bike, through rice paddies with a bunch of pale white people is not the real Bali, but it's a pretty fun experience nonetheless! The riding is very straightforward and is downhill almost the whole way. You barely need to pedal. There is an optional uphill segment at the end if you need to get the heart racing for an hour or so and even this is not particularly taxing. Breakfast and lunch is included. The breakfast in particular, is in a very scenic place overlooking an active volcano and a large lake.If you need a break from polluted beaches in Kuta or you need to get away from the five star hotel in Nusa Dua, this is a worthwhile activity"

We also stopped to view the famous rice terraces.We then jumped on the bikes and headed downhill, stopping at a family compound to look around, rice paddies (Weda is a rice farmer), and sacred Banyan tree.

What a wonderful way to see Bali, how the villages work, customs and the compounds they live in. When our group of 7 first considered the bike ride there was only passing interest. People who haven't ridden for some time, those who don;t feel fit enough and the hot weather are enough to put people off. But as you will see from other reviews, these things are only minor concerns. The relatively downhill ride is just rolling most of the time and you just have to be able to balance ok....and watch out for coconuts falling as well. We talked the whole group into riding and they all loved it. You will struggle to see \"inside\" Bali if you miss this tour.Eco cycling also give you the option of riding the final 1.5 to 2 hours of mainly uphill if you want something further after 2 hours of rolling downhill. I find it a great way to get some exercise on a cruisey day out and 4 of our party of 13 pushed on with the guide. I had done the extra bit on my last tour and it was just as hard. The beauty is that you get to meet up with the rest at Eco Cycling's own restaurant and join them for some excellent food and drinks. Something for everyone on this tour and doing it the second time was quite different with a coffee plantation tour added in, as well as Wayan finding a humungus spider and letting us play with it. It was big.....but seemed friendly :-)"

Based on the reviews, I knew the main bike ride was esentially all down hill, that we did a lot of driving at the start, and that other tours follow similar routes so I was a little concerned this might be too much of touristy schtick. My son and I, however, loved it from start to finish. The view from the breakfast place was amazing. The sampling of fruit, teas and coffee at the farm was tons of fun. Gliding down hill created a great breeze and made it easy to take on all the scenery, and we rarely saw anyone but locals who were warm and welcoming. The planned stops were far more informative than I expected. Really learned about Bali culture from a great guide. We even went into a rice paddy and planned ride! Our group was also interested in getting some exercise and we were given the option at the end to ride an extra 8km all up hill to our lunch. 10 out of 11 of us gave it a go, and 8 of us made it the whole way. To be honest it was tough in the heat and I couldn't have done it without some extra help from our amazing and patient guide, but I loved getting in the exercise and that they gave that extra option. It made the lunch (and beer) at the end that much more memorable."

We were worried we would get all hot and bothered - but not a bit of it; we felt cooled by the breeze and hardly had to pedal at all.

Stopping to tour a local Balinese home compound to see how the generations all live and work together, with an amazingly friendly guide who answered each and every question we had on Balinese lifestyle (I now know what a teeth grinding ceremony is), religion (Balinese Hinduism is a beautiful combination of Hinduism and Animism), and local customs. The day was so full of excitement, wonder, learning, local history, culture, new friends (our group consisted of several families from Australia and Sweden), and lots of smiles all around.

Some people in our group had visited the place previously so they had the option to start the ride and skip the visit.The ride was mostly downhill with a few slopes- so don't worry if you're not super fit, the main workout you'll get is with your arms and your fingers (hehe) We stopped in a local home and got a little insight to their daily life, family and religious practices. We also got to cycle through the rice paddies and the village, which was a nice way to take everything in and get a feel for the place.The tour ended with a great lunch at Bali Eco Cycling's own eatery overlooking the rice paddies. Wayan, our guide was very knowledgeable and engaging, he also lives in the area so it was great to talk to him and understand more about life in Ubud. A little tip- might be worth trying to get a good idea (or a map) of where you stay, especially if you live in a private villa as the driver had a bit of an issue dropping us off at the end of the trip."

We actually arranged to do the sunrise walk up mt batur with the same company first and then met the cycling tour at a nearby restaurant for breakfast. The views were really nice and it is a lovely place to sit and take it all in. We then headed off to a coffee tasting area which probably took longer than i'd have liked, although we were quite tired having been up since 2am. Then we got to our bikes and the day flew by. It is not a difficult ride at all and rarely in the 25km do you even need to pedal as it is literally all down hill. We stopped a number of times where our guide gave us a tour of a typical Balinese house and also some rice fields. The guide was knowledgable and funny and made the day very enjoyable throughout. At the end there is an option to ride a further 9km which isn't quite so easy and includes a few hills but even this wasn't too difficult although it was very hot by then. About half of our group did this but there is no pressure to do so at all. All in all we had a great day and would recommend both the tour and the company without hesitation."

The ride started in Kintamani around mid morning and ended at the outskirt of Ubud shortly before 3pm. The ride was downhill all the way with almost no uphill and very little flat ride. We were then transferred back to Ubud in a min-van. The English speaking guide was very friendly and knowledgeable. There was also an assistant guide who served as \"safety officer\" riding at the back of the column to ensure everyone ride safely and that no one is being left far behind or strayed away from the group. Overall we were very satisfied with their service. Their pricing was also very reasonable. However their bikes were a bit old. But i presumed bikes from other operators were likely to be equally old/worn-out as well."

One member of our party wasn't able to ride but was able to follow along in the bus and.join us on the many stops. This tour was recommended to me and it was the perfect way for me to celebrate my birthday. Our tour guide Wayan is extremely funny, informative, thoughtful and a real credit to the company.

She just loved it and the quiet roads meant we felt safe the entire day. They took such an interest in my baby giving me a little break as well. Hills were few and not too difficult so minimal fitness is fine. Meals were fantastic as well.

Full day tour commenced with collection from hotel 8.30 am, driven by minibus (ten persons on trip) which gave opportunity to enjoy the countryside before arriving at Lake View Restaurant, Penelokan, which gave excellent views of the surrounding areas, including Mount Batur volcano and crater lake. Good breakfast buffet selection, which we enjoyed sitting outside. Good toilets, useful before cycle ride.Bikes + cycle helmets of mixed quality, adequate. Minibus available if any problems or you don't wish to continue cycling. Pedalling along flat quiet roads, able to enjoy the real Balinese countryside, see the paddy fields and different stages of rice growing. The two Guides spoke very good English and were keen to share information about the different areas we passed through. At the end of the flat roads you have the opportunity to either board the minibus to go to the restaurant, or if you prefer the challenge of cycling uphill, then continue on the bike. Well worth the effort and you arrive at the restaurant. Buffet style, very good quality meat (no bones or gristle !) and included in the tour price (which was amazingly good value). Board the minibus and stop at nursery growing all kinds of herbs / spices / and coffee trees. Able to sample a dozen or so different herbal teas and coffee (again included in the price) and for a small amount of money enjoy a cup of Luwak coffee. The various coffee / teas are available to purchase but absolutely no pressure to buy any.Toured a Balinese kampong (family home) and all sorts of interesting information given by the Guide as to how the families live and their various ceremonies.Thoroughly recommend the cycle tour if you want to get out and explore and see the countryside."

The views were spectacular and the food and coffee was good. However, I would have taken the trekking tour with another company had I known we would be provided with so little information. Did we do the crater rim walk? I have no idea. We definitely didn't visit the agro tourism place and I for one wasn't asked my opinion about that.

The breakfast was very good, boiled eggs, banana sandwich and coffee/tea. We were able to see monkeys and the steam vents soon after the sun rose.

We were picked up from our home stay in the morning and took a 45 minute or so bus ride up to have breakfast overlooking Mt Batur, which was beautiful, and the food was good! On the ride up, we had a brief photo op stop overlooking so gorgeous tiered rice fields. After breakfast, we stopped to try the famous Luawk coffee (cat poop coffee) and get a tour of how it is made. After the brief tour, you have the option to try the Luwak coffee for about $5 USD per cup. If you choose not to try it, you still get a sampler tray of several delicious teas and coffees that are very unique! After the tea and coffee, you have the opportunity to try some local fruits. Finally, it was time to start the bike tour. It really is a downhill tour, but it's still super fun! There is hardly any traffic on the roads and you make frequent stops. We stopped at a local home where our guide explained the Balinese lifestyle to us. We also stopped at several different stages of rice production. I actually got to get knee-deep in mud to help plant some rice :) Overall it was a great day that ended with the option to take an uphill ride if you wanted a workout. After the bike ride, a buffet lunch was served at the company's restaurant, which was also great. There was smoked chicken and duck, veggies, rice and noodles.

I was fortunate to have a small group (5) who all got along with each other.The view from the Lake View Restaurant is just stunning. It is a terrific way to spend breakfast. The breakfast itself was standard fare - fruits, pancakes, Indo nasi goreng. Our tour guide Gustu was a very happy and knowledgeable chap and freely shared information about the area and things we looked at. The group had a great conversation about anything and everything on the way up the mountain.The eco tour of the the different plants, fruits and coffees is a good inclusion; so too, is the tea and coffee tasting. I had previously enjoyed a cup of Luwak coffee in Ubud so did not partake here. I did find the prices for their products were higher than in other similar retail shops. We got cycling about two to three hours later after a short safety briefing. The bikes and helmet have seen better days but are safe enough. Once we got going, it was 23km mostly downhill.This part of the trip - and the main purpose - is just wonderful. It is so far removed from the hustle and bustle of Kuta,Legian etc and really is the Bali everyone should see. We were shown a traditional Balinese household and explained a bit about family life.We saw many, many rice fields and went down many back roads off the beaten track. At the end of the trip we had lunch at the operator's own warung. It was a relaxing to finish the tour.I thoroughly recommend this trip and encourage you to see a Bali that is not driven by over zealous vendors and touts."

The food was okay, we just hope Lake View Restaurant would pay more attention to hygiene .... their foods were swarmed with flies everywhere! :( I'm not a huge fan of bike riding but as it was mostly down hill I decided to give it a go. My 6 yr old and my 8yr old rode the whole way, and I regretted it at the very moment we went on. Some of the tracks were REALLY steep I couldn't help wondering how my kids could handle their bikes as it went too fast for them. I had to shout many times to them to slow down. But the tour guide kept assuring us that the track was safe even for children. I was taking a turn leading; my husband was drafting \u2014 riding close behind our kids, and the tour guide was on the back. On the 3/4 way to finish line, my nightmare came true! There was a very sharp turn and steep slope, I did not have time to warn my kids \u2014 my 6 yr old's bike lost control and he fell off, hitting his face to the ground! We all stopped, got in the bus to mend his wound. He had bloody lips, badly bruised and had scratched his knees and elbow, but thank God, wasn't seriously injured.... We just hope the tour guide would lead us instead of riding behind us, so that he could warn us if there is a car coming or a sharp turn. And please, please, please, Bali Eco; at least provide some knee elbow wrist protective pads, especially for kids!!After riding, they took the whole group for a nice lunch but very late (at 3 PM!)

We combined a sunrise trek up Mount Batur with a Ubud cycling tour, since the end point of one is virtually the starting point of the other. This could be tiring for some, but if you're up to it, it saves on your travelling time. My family (wife and two preteen daughters) were very well taken care of throughout our ascend and descend from Mount Batur volcano. They are not terribly fit, but our guides (including the one from the Association of Mount Batur Trekking Guides) helped them fully all along the way. The guide from Bali Eco even piggy-backed my wife down the volcano when she could not handle the descend due to knee problem. Hats off, guys!We also went on a snorkelling trip with Bali Eco on the eastern shores of Bali, at Lipah Bay (I think) near Amed. The journey there was long (min. 2 hours one way from Nusa Dua) and windy (along mountainous single-lane roads), but the snorkelling experience was well worth it! Apart from our little group of 10, we saw not many more tourists at the snorkelling site, which features a small wreckage just a few metres off the rocky beach. Saw many flourishing corals and colourful fishes undisturbed by the occasional snorkelers. Guides were very friendly and helpful, as always."

You get picked up about 7.30am and head up to the mountains where you have breakfast overlooking the lake, then onwards past the rice fields where you stop for a photo and then on to a coffee plantation for a lesson in coffee beans and a tasting session. After this a short drive to get to the start of the bike ride. You are kitted out with your helmet and a bike and off you go. You have a guide at the front and back of your group and there are only 12 riders per group. A bus follows behind in case you get tired. Most of the ride is downhill, but for the couple of short uphill stretches you can get off and push. Your ride takes you through villages where you get to stop and see how the locals live and finishes with a fantastic buffet lunch. Make sure you take a camera with you that goes round your neck for quick photos or a small backpack. You are given a bottle of water and there is storage on the bike for it."

The biking consisted of touring villages, a coffee plantation, wood carving shop, and a rice farm,. It was 96% downhill and the 4% uphill was very short. It was an excellent tour for the educational component learning about real life for many Balinese people. We learned about the native plants & their healing components; how coffee is grown and harvested; how GM and organic rice is grown, harvested and the difference between them.Our guide was Weda and he was excellent. His English was pretty good and he was also a rice farmer before becomong a guide so he was the perfect person to guide us.The food was traditional Balinese and was plentiful & excellent.They pick you up just before 8 am and you are taken home around 4 pm. The transit van was newer and very comfortable.We would highly recommend this tour."

I booked through their website from Australia before we left and paid in rupiah at the end of our tour. Our guide was Ring and he was great! He was very funny, spoke English very well and kept my children laughing all day. After the long drive to Ubud (approx. 2hrs) we stopped at a Coffee stop where Ring explained all the different species of plants and their uses. We tasted about 12 different coffee's then got back into the van to go to the Restaurant by the volcano for breakfast. Food was nice but not your traditional breakfast and because the drive is so long I would suggest you have a light breakfast before leaving your hotel, even an Up n Go or something similar. The view at the restaurant is magnificent and well worth the drive. We then got back into the van and drove to the meeting place to collect our bikes. The bikes were all in great condition and Ring made sure that all the females were given the opportunity to have a nice comfy gel seat cover! Water was then provided and we started off on the bike ride. The ride was great all down hill, not too many motorbikes or cars on the roads that we took so not scary. We visited a village and were shown how they live and cook, visited a Rice field and were able to help out the workers with banging the rice, the views and scenery are really picturesque and beautiful. On the tour you really get to see the real Bali. Towards the end of the tour you are given the option of continuing on the down hill ride which at the end you will get back into the van to be taken to the restaurant or if you enjoy a challenge you can ride all the way back to the hotel but it does involve riding uphill and some of the hills are quite steep. My family and I chose the option to get back into the van. You then enjoy a nice lunch with a view of the Rice Paddy fields then off for the long drive back to your hotel. This tour was the highlight of our trip and I would not hesitate in recommending it and I would definitely do it again! It is for all ages, if you can ride a bike then this is a great tour to do.And Ring he makes it all that bit more enjoyable with his funny jokes and his great smiling personality."

Our guide, Ring, was the BEST! He was super informative while also being hilarious! He had our group rolling all day long! The local children were so sweet, our group spent time playing soccer with them. When a little boy about 7 years old asked me for a pen for school, I was so happy i had one to give him. If i would have known that the kids loved pens, I would have brought loads. I hope you all that read this can bring some and give them away to the kids for school. What a simple gesture to make someone smile. If you only have 1 day in Bali to explore, do this and you won't regret it!"

The company were very helpful in changing or booking so that we could share the day with some friends who arrived after I had made the booking. You are picked up from your hotel and taken to a cafe for breakfast over looking the volcano and hot springs. Then on to a lovely coffee plantation to sample the coffees. This is optional though so if you did not want to visit this you can just tell the guide. We were then taken to bike pick up and began the adventure. 2 hrs riding through the mountsins of Bali, It really was an amazing experience you actually don't really ride as every part is down hill, I think I used my pedals three times at the most so as long as you can sit on a bike the trip is suitable for you. we were taken through the rice fields and stopped to help the ladies harvesting the crops it was lovely. We were also taken to a typical Balinese village and shown around the houses and the guide explained how life in the village works. When we finished our trip we were taken to another restaurant for lunch and the food was delicious. We were picked up at 8 am and arrived back at our hotel around 4pm it was a brilliant day. The driver was very good too as we were transferring to Kuta from Ubud that day, He picked up our luggage from hotel and dropped us off at our next hotel in Kuta. We were very grateful and really appreciated his help. Our guide for the day was lovely too so happy and smiley and he did what ever he could to help us. Would highly recommend this trip really is good value for money too, think it is around \u00a318pp which is brilliant value for money, considering we paid 3 times this amount to visit the Elephant Safari which in our opinion did not compare with this trip for value."

Although, it was not as good as expected, based on the leaflet. Eco? Big touristy restaurants, the civets in small cages, and most of the day in a minivan in stead of on the bike. It took us 3 hours to start cycling. Cycling is more a side-activity. Pace is really low. We were a bit disappointed about the visit to the plantation, where we were supposed to buy some expensive products. And unlike what the leaflet suggests, we had to pay extra money for another drop-off point than the pick-up point. Overall, poor value for money."

We were greeted with a variety of complementary flavoured coffees and teas. After feeling like purchasing every one of those flavors we bought a few and moved on to the cycle depot. We cycled almost 25kms entirely downhill visiting traditional residence (wonderful experience for the kids) and real life rice fields. We even harvested some rice.

Since then, we have done the tour two more times, bringing back friends and family. Our tour guide, Ring, was so funny! He is from one of the villages that the bike ride takes you through, so he is a wealth of knowledge about local culture. We've requested him each time we've gone back - he's such a kick and makes the day so enjoyable! I've heard great things about all of the guides though, so I don't think you can go wrong. The traditional food on the tour is great - both breakfast and lunch are set in beautiful locations. The tour also includes a stop where you get to taste 12 different coffees and teas, and learn about other local fruits and spices. You can try a cup of Kopi Luwak for $5, but everything else is complimentary.  The majority of the ride is coasting downhill, with about three little hills. You take different stops to learn about local culture, rice production, and so many other interesting facts about real balinese life. Ring said that growing up, he had to learn four different languages so he can speak appropriately to people in each of the four different castes, along with Indonesian. He obviously speaks English as well, which makes six languages (He's only 25)! We also stopped to see a 500 year old Banyan tree, and I got to play soccer with some of the village boys - so much fun! I can't speak highly enough of this tour and also the people we've met and rode along with. Each time has been wonderful! The price of about $33 is so worth it, as they do pick up and drop off at your hotel, feed you two meals, along with snacks and the coffee/tea tasting. The bikes are good enough quality and helmets are offered if you want. I've been to Bali four times, and this tour is by far the best thing we've done, and like I said, we've done it three times and enjoy it every time!"

The tour finished with a (late) lunch at a restaurant belonging to Bali Eco Cycling. This trip really is suitable for anyone who can ride a bike.

My 7 year old daughter can cycle but as we don't so it very often, cycling on the narrow bumpy paths/roads through villages and rice paddy fields was a bit of a challenge. Cars and motorcycles can come very close to cyclists on occasion, and there are many hard, uneven surfaces along the route; at our first stop to visit a traditional Balinese home, we switched to a tandem bicycle so that she could ride with my husband. That worked a LOT better (even though her feet could barely reach the pedals!) and I would recommend this option for anyone with young kids who are not experienced cyclists and/or have very good control over the bicycle!The others on the tour were adults and could go a lot faster, but the team at Eco was excellent and there was always someone who stayed behind to cycle at our pace and tell us about the sights we passed. The van with the bicycles and mini bus drove close behind us so we could stop any time or switch bikes any time we wanted. The guides and staff at Eco were excellent - friendly, patient and helpful. Thank you for the lovely time :)Two thumbs up!"

The tour is largely down hill (not scary down hill) and what isn't down hill is flat so it really is accessible to anyone. Our guide Gitar was lovely, very approachable and more than happy to answer questions. Nice small groups and even though there were several groups who would have been leaving around the same time they staggered the stops and sites so we rarely came across another group. The scenery was lovely, as was visiting the villages and the locals. Lunch was a particular stand out. Hotel pick is always nice and they pick up from Seminyak as well as Ubud."

We decided that we were interested in seeing more of how traditional Balinese live. We opted for this tour on the recommendation of the villa staff and were rapt with the decision! Our day started with breakfast overlooking the caldera of the volcanic heartland of Bali. We the bussed to our biking departure point following a brief photo opportunity overlooking the terraced rice fields of greater Ubud. Our bike tour weaved 25km downhill through the regional areas of Ubud over the course of about 2.5 hours. We stopped a number of times to see a traditional Balinese community, a temple and sacred tree, rice fields, and rice harvesting. The bus tour then took us to a plentiful lunch, and onto a coffee plantation where the famous Luwak Coffee is gathered and roasted. Our guide Wayan was incredible in answering a multitude of questions and providing insights into the Balinese culture. The bus picks you up from your hotel, and drops you off at the Monkey Forest if you want to visit, or back at your hotel. We would definitely recommend to anyone that they take the day to experience this tour for themselves."

Stops along the way gave us an insight into local culture - family compound, workers in rice fields, village temple etc. Our guide Joe (Tikut) was brilliant - he had excellent english and was very knowledgable and entertaining. The bikes were in reasonable condition and helmets and water was provided. Lunch at the end was very high standard. The only detraction from the experience was the nearly four hours driving around (view rice terraces, breakfast, coffee plantation) before we actually got on the bikes. This was not apparent from the website. I had expect to go to the breakfast and then to the start of the ride. Everyone in our group throughout the ride was brilliant and I think the company would be better to focus on that. Or at least more clearly describe the days itinerary so that people do not get agitated wondering when they will actually get on the bike. Nonetheless, a great experience which I would not have missed and which I would even do again on another visit."

But we ended up getting up at 6:30 and going on the trip and we did not regret it one bit. Our group was small - 8 adults and our own five year old - and we had two guides who both did a great job. We drove in a small van for about two hours - the only thing that surprised me a bit since I perhaps hadn't read the information on the website well enough - to a restaurant with the most spectacular view of the inside of a volcano. Nice breakfast and then a short drive to a small plantation where we saw some of the local plants and had a taste of local coffee and tea. There was a shop where they sold all sort of tea and coffee and other herbal products and the atmosphere was very relaxed and perfect for our tempo with a five year old. Then we drove a few more minutes to get on the bikes. The bikes were not of the latest model, but the brakes worked and since it was down hill all the way it was fine. We had a child seat on one and this was not a problem at all. Riding through the local villages on a bike (as opposed to in a car) was fantastic. We stopped at a local house to see the inside, at a rise field, drove past an illegal cock fight, took lots of photos and just had a great trip. We ended up having lunch with a lot of the other groups and the lunch was great. All in all a very recommendable day. And our five year old loved it as well.Pros:+ fantastic experience of nature and local culture+ good guides+ good value for moneyCons:- bikes are not the newest- long car drive with a five year old"

I was unfortunately in a bike accident and ended up dislocating both shoulders after I was thrown from my bike less than a minute into the ride. I was taken by a bumpy mini van (weaving like a maniac through traffic on very narrow roads) to a local clinic. I spent five hours there and they wanted to put me under in order to put my shoulders back in. ECO TOURS did have one of their guides with us that knew English and could translate, so that was helpful. While waiting for a specialist to arrive, the shoulder that was by far the worst was accidentally put back into place by my girlfriend. The clinic workers and 'doctors' were useless. A wound on my left elbow was not cleaned at all in the clinic, and had become very infected. I ended up needing to go on my own time two days later to have it cut, scraped, and cleaned so that it didn't get any worse. My issue with ECO TOURS came when the manager (owner?), an Australian, came to visit us in our hotel later in the day after the accident. Through conversation, he came to understand that we had still paid for the bike tour even though we didn't really participate, and he said, \"oh my gosh, I'm going to have someone come bring you back your fees tomorrow.\" That never happened. If he hadn't mentioned it, I would have just chalked it up to 'oh well,' but after he said he would do it, I was really disappointed that he didn't follow through. Also, their choice of medical clinics is scary. It is dirty, and they are inept. Lord help you if you do get hurt on the tour like I did. If ECO TOURS had refunded the fees we paid, I would have rated them a 5 star for their professionalism, going out of their way to stay with me in the clinic, and to get me to it as best they could after the accident. I just feel like they dropped the ball in this situation."

Drove up to a restaurant where we had breakfast over looking volcano and lake, nice food good setting. Then drove to a coffee plantation where our guide showed us some local plants and the lowak cats before being served a platter of about 9 different teas and coffees to try ( and purchase if wanted in shop -not pushy) and fresh fruit. Also opportunity to try lowak coffee for about 2pound extra. Then went to start of ride, bikes were good quality with well cared for brakes, gears and suspension. Also provided with water carrier, helmets and gel seats so no need to carry bags etc. Easy downhill ride great scenery quiet RDS, freq stops to look round things of interest. option to do longer ride with uphill sections, which I did, not too tricky but hot work. Nice facilities at lunch with cool towels and cold drinks. Lunch was nice hot and fresh. Overall great day, we paid 275idr = 13 GBP ish. Would really recommend.

We got driven to the top where there was a stunning view of Mt Batur and it's lake which irrigates much of Bali's rice fields and also has fish farms. And then we were given a lovely Indonesian breakfast which was really filling. Then we got to see how Catpoocino was produced ( if you need to ask it would be a good idea to see it for yourself!), and various Balinese fruits and spices growing. Then we got on our bikes which were in very good shape and well maintained, got given helmets and water and we were off. We had a guide in front Gita who was our entertaining tour leader, and a guide at the back to make sure people didn't go astray. it was a group of 7 so not too many. We got to see rice paddies up close, to see a real Balinese home compound and we also visited an amazing place that produced intricate carving of doors and bed heads. although there were a couple of places we could have bought things we were not pushed to do so. At the end of the downhill bit, Gita gave us the option of biking uphill for about 45 minutes to get to our restaurant to actually use our pedals (seriously, there are only one or two small rises to pedal upwards - all the rest is downhill). I didn't do it but two of our group did and it was clearly a challenge because when they arrived at our lunch place they looked like drowned rats (very hot ones) and it hadn't been raining. The lunch was very good and Gita had phoned ahead to ensure that those of us who were vegetarian would be well taken care of."

At the end of the tour we were brought to another restaurant for buffet lunch. I'd say it was one of my best meal in Bali. Everything was delicious, the gado-gado, smoked duck, chicken satay, even the balinese condiment, sambel matah was nice. Will definitely recommend this tour for anyone going to Bali!"

Picked up at 07:00 at our hotel in a mini -bus, picked up other travellers from various locations before heading off to breakfast overlooking Lake Batur and an active volcano which fortunately behaved itself. Visited a local home and had the culture and customs explained to us, very humble compared to what we are used to. Downhill cycling, though rice fields, where we stopped to watch harvesting. Visited coffee place and tasted the famous Luwak coffee, then on to a lovely lunch. Lots of sights along the way and photo opportunities. A great day, knowledgeable young host, very affordable, probably the highlight of my week in Bali. Highly recommend."

My husband and I and our friend who lives in Ubud, took this trip and are so glad that we did. Everything was perfect. We had a great day of eating, learning about the local culture, and last but not least, cycling. Our guide Joe was really friendly and enthusiastic and had a great sense of humor. Our second guide Bob, who followed behind us, did an excellent job (he really worked hard the whole time looking out for us). The food was great, the stops along the way were genuine and not manufactured just for tourists, and the biking was all downhill! It was a hot day, but the cycling cooled us off nicely and the stops were timed so we never got too tired. We were able to interact with the locals and at the end we were given cool, wet towels and an incredible lunch. We were so impressed with the level of attention to detail -- at the start, Joe asked what our dietary restrictions were. At lunch my husband and I had special vegetarian plates made just for us (even though there were plenty of veggie dishes on the buffett). It was such a first-class operation. We believe the company must have paved the road we cycled on themselves, since it was the nicest road we have seen in Bali!"

Breakfast was served overlooking the largest lake in Bali and an active volcano. The bike riding was great it was mostly downhill so not hard work at all.

Banur which was beautiful. From there we visited a coffee plantation and got to try the infamous Luwak coffee - it was good but not sure it lived up the hype for me. After the coffee we then began the cycling tour. The bikes were mostly new-ish and in good condition. Our guide, Nano (for short) was very friendly and led us through some beautiful countryside. It was probably 98% downhill and required little to no strenuous effort, unless you opt in for the 9 km uphill ride at the end of the tour which was pretty brutal but fun. For lunch we had a great buffet and enjoyed the company of the other people on the trip."

The company is very professional - from the pick up and driver, through to the bike care, assistants and the Guide. Our guide 'Joe' was fantastic! I can not speak highly enough of him. He was funny, charming, educated, informative and passionate about his country and culture. Even though I had done this ride twice before, Joe was still full of new and interesting information. His English was exceptional. I would recommend Bali Eco Cycling above all other similar tours. There are a few other operators offering a similar tour but, having previously done one of them, I would not go with anyone other than Bali Eco Cycling now. We had an amazing breakfast over looking the volcano, an easy downhill ride for about 25kms then an awesome, yummy lunch to finish! There are many 'kodak' or \u00e7anon' moments along the way! (as Joe would say). Definitely a 'must' do in Bali!"

True, the tour didn't feel particularly off the beaten track, and the family compound visit did feel a little invasive. But apart from that and the poor condition of the bikes, we had a blast. Our tour guide was very funny. He certainly added to the experience. The first part of the day was a nice breakfast overlooking a fantastic view of a large volcano, I fail to see how you could not be impressed by that!!The next stop was to a coffee farm where they invited you to try many different coffees and you could also purchase the famous Lewak coffee, pooped out by the animal of the same name.Then it was on to the bikes. True it was downhill for the first part, passing through rice fields, but then we were given the option to branch off from everybody else and do a bit of uphill. This was pretty strenuous and certainly was a good workout, although parts were a little frustrating due to the poor condition of the bikes - in particular, the gears kept slipping, which was very annoying when pedaling uphill. This part of the tour is probably not suited for people who don't cycle very often, but if you are fit enough I highly recommend it, as you do go to some more remote parts of the countryside. The restaurant for lunch was a welcome sight after building up a sweat, and the buffet lunch was delicious. Take some cash though, as drinks were extra, particularly that hard earned Bintang!All in all we had a great day, don't be put off by the cynics... Go out and enjoy yourself and you will get the most out of it!"

My perspective may be different, since I am not traveling with small children - I recognize that there are only so many activities one can do with a family in tow. This might be perfect in that situation. However, this \"tour\" is simply a number of stops at tourist trap locations where you're either going to be sold to, hard, or panhandled, or paraded around in front of the natives in some weird both ways version of poverty vouyerism. The actual biking part is literally all downhill, save for a few minutes where you're suddenly supposed to go offroad on old, poorly maintained bicycles. I was especially uncomfortable in the \"home compound visit\". In retrospect, I understand that the family is being paid by the tour group, but it still felt very invasive. Beyond that, I didn't learn anything particularly illuminating from the tour guide. He didn't have much to say beyond the standard script. The breakfast food was terrible - the restaurant caters to tour groups but our package didn't include the freshly made food. The lunch food, also a restaurant catering solely to tourists, was better - and they appeared to be very accommodating to vegetarians and people with special diet needs. I will say that the price was very reasonable - just 360,000 idr. I would be even more disappointed by the trip if I had paid more. I wish that someone would set up a tour company that *actually* went off the beaten path, and that actually endeavored to show people something more authentic. Perhaps that can never exist, because tourists ruin everything. Very conflicted."

Breakfast on the mountain opposite volcanoes - very acceptable. Visit to Coffee farm (hate it when you are forced around the shop to purchase). Visit to Village (very informative). Bike riding - so much fun. And of course it rained (not their fault) but they had plastic ponchos for us. Well that was a laugh. We all got saturated but all in good fun.

We booked this bike ride before left home, but were never told that it would take 2.5 hours on a mini bus and bad roads to get there. My poor 7 year old got motion sickness and so it wasn't a good start. It would be much better if you were staying in Ubud as you wouldn't have to go so far in the bus to start the day. Would definitely NOT recommend if staying in Legian area. We also thought that we would be riding to all the places they tell you about in the brochure e.g. coffee plantation, but instead we were still on the bus. Coffee plantation was pretty ordinary (even though the tasting was great) and the toilet facilities were atrocious!!! BEWARE and take your own wipes.!!! Rice paddies, Banyan tree and Balinese compound also pretty ordinary, but nice to see. The ride itself was great, but way too long. We had a 3 year old in a seat and a 7 year old on a tandem, which was great. They didn't seem to fuss too much. Food was nice, bananas and water along the way. We had a great day for it weather wise too. I would have loved to have been able to stop along the way and go into some markets and buy some souvenirs, but they don't so this.

We didnt climb to the summit, nor did their guide come with us up the mountain. They didn't 'cook the eggs' in the steam vents and we didn't go to the second or third craters.We did see a great sunrise tho at the lookout at (nearly) the top and had eggs and bread and coffee. If it had not been our good luck that the official guide DID speak good english and was very professional (because many were not), we may as well have just hired a taxi and walked up the hill on our own. I pity the poor buggers in other groups who did not have a competent guide and were rushed to the top.The following claim on the Eco tours web site was untrue on our trip, 'Unlike other tour companies, we trek around the whole rim of the volcano climbing to it\u2019s summit, witnessing the large troop of monkeys exit the largest crater, pass by steam fissures (where we cook our eggs for breakfast) and follow the rim to explore the second and third craters and the most recent lava flows. This is one of the highlights of the trip and we can assure that you won\u2019t miss this experience, as our own experienced English speaking guide accompanies you as well as the compulsory local guide on the trek to ensure it happens (unlike other trekking companies who only use the compulsory local guide).'Sorry guys but you need to update the info or do what you say you'll do.

To the companies defense, we were sold the tickets by our guesthouse and we made some assumptions. Our major assumptions were that we would get some exercise and that we would be on the bike most of the day. The day started off with being picked up from our guesthouse around 0800 in a ~10 passenger van. We were driven ~1hr to breakfast. Then driven in the vehicle to a coffee plantation with a really poor quality educational briefing of medicinal plants. Finally, after ~3-4 hours we were dropped off at the top of a hill to pick up our bikes. The bikes were of OK quality and definitely met my expectations (I've used some pretty shady bikes on tours in other countries).Once we got on our bikes after the 3+ hours of waiting we realized the ride was COMPLETELY downhill with literally zero pedaling required. To the companies defense they do mention in their brochure \"cycle downhill\". The ride is completely downhill with an optional uphill component at the end. In regards to the brochure, you get to see the \"Real Bali away from the tourist areas.\" What they forgot to mention is that you get to go away from the tourists areas to be around HUNDREDS of tourists. There was one point in time where we were at the tree they brag about and there were well over 50 people staring at this tree plus the groups that just departed downhill in front of us.The positives:-this would be a great family trip with a mixed athletic crowd (my review is so negative because we were looking for a real cycling experience with a little bit of exercise away from hundreds of tourists)- tour guides were in front/back of each group so no worries about loosing your little kids- helmets included- pickup from hotel- guide was very nice with good englishNeutral:- No athletic requirementNegatives:- Tourist trap with tons of tourists- Misleading brochure- Driven around for ~ 3-4 hours before getting our bikes- No pedaling was required for the tour- The Balinese plantation was nothing more than a garden walking into the coffee plantation- Ample water on tour was only one bottle of water outside of breakfast/lunch (I would have been fine bringing my own water but since they bragged about ample water I didn't bring my own)- Group was large enough that it was somewhat difficult to really learn about Balinese culture from the guide. The only area I learned quite a bit was during the home/compound visit.Cost: $30 each"

I had the pleasure of doing a downhill bike ride with Bali Eco Cycling and it was the highlight of my time in Bali.Efficient hotel pick up, a relatively small group of 9 people and a happy local guide made the day extra enjoyable.A stunning view whilst having breakfast at Lakeview Hotel overlooking a volcanic caldera and shimmering lake was then followed by an interesting visit to a luwak coffee stop. We then started the bike ride proper and whilst it was not 100% downhill I felt a bit guilty not having to pedal very much at all and just allowing gravity to do her stuff 90% of the time :0We stopped in at a typical Balinese family compound and had a very interesting 20 minute stay as it was explained to us how the Balinese practice of communal family living worked in a day to day context.The route we took was very much off the tourist track and I had a sense of being a fleeting visitor into everyday Balinese rural life. It was also delightful how the small children would often wave and call out hello with a big smile on their face as we rode by.The lunch at the completion of the ride was of a very high standard comprising of local food coupled with cold drinks. A great end to a perfect experience. I highly recommend Bali Eco Cycling and would be happy to come back in a heartbeat and do another ride with them."

The organization, breakfast and especially lunch were very good, some of our party said the best lunch they had all holiday! Loved cycling through the villages and seeing rice terraces etc.The only reason that I did not give it 5 Star is because the seats in our van were so uncomfortable, my husband still has a sore tail bone!!! Nothing to do with riding the bikes, we found these very good especially the brakes as you have to have them on most of the time as it is all downhill!

The ride was so easy apart from the last few hundred metres which I got off and pushed which was no drama as it gave me an opportunity to chat to some locals.

A group of 5 of us did the cycling tour and the mount Batur climb with this company and a good time was had by all.The pick ups and drop offs went well and the food on both trips was fine but not wonderful. We have had significantly better on another similar tour. Ring, the cycle guide was first rate and gave loads of fascinating information and was a lot of fun. On the mountain trip the role of the guide was different so he was less memorable. The local mountain guides were attentive and helpful. The equipment was functional but had clearly had a lot of use. On both trips the basic 'offer' was not too taxing but the added extra of the additional 8k on the bike and the extra push to the top of Mount Batur were more of a challenge. On both trips we were in a group of about 12 which was fine. On the cycle trip it was initially worrying that this company had 120 guests on the volcano that morning but in the event they stagger the group departures and we only saw a relatively small proportion of them on our ride. The breakfast and lunch stops, however, where we were all together were a bit of a crowd with a canteen feel about them.. The food and service were ok but the impact was more that it made the trip feel less individual than a similar cycle tour I have taken with a smaller company. The price was good however and as long as you know what to expect you should still have a good time. If you want a more intimate experience then you will probably need to pay more and look elsewhere."

The Minibus is a little cramped but tolerable. The breakfast was nice but the views were incredible.The Coffee tasting was excellent especially the Coffee Luwak which is highly recommended. As for the cycling the bike I had was a bit old and the gears kept disengaging, so chose your bike carefully. But comfortable ride and you do not really need gears in the downhil part. The ride is 25km all downhill, in this section I think I only pedaled twice. Then the optional 8km uphill section which was more challenging than I thought. But it is all worth it at the end for the outstanding lunch provided by the tour. Return was 45 minutes late in returning to the hotel but you cannot blame them for traffic. All in all a great time and highly recommended. Tip: bring another shirt to wear if you opt for the uphill cycle."

Unfortunately, we couldn't see the volcano because it was covered in mist (this happens about 50% of the time but is not mentioned in the brochure). It was a long bus ride from Seminyak (about 2 hours) - in hindsight, I should have done the tour when I was staying in Ubud, However, it was good value (about S35 AU) considering it included breakfast and lunch and was well organised."

Special thanks to Ketut who was not only funny but spoke fluent English (Even had a sight London accent, kinda like Bali's answer to Jude Law). I and a few others took up the challenge of an extra 8kms or so, mostly up hill, at the end of the ride which was completely optional but got the heart pumping. Otherwise the 25kms of mostly downhill coasting would be achievable by most. The thing that impressed me most was the friendly reception from all the villagers, especially the children who loved giving high fives as we past. Put this on you list of things to do in Bali!"

It was such great value for money for what is effectively an all you can eat breakfast and lunch, an excellent tea and coffee tasting (where you try more than 12 hot drinks) and get the option to try Luwak coffee (the most expensive coffee in the world!) and a great day cycling where you stop off at so many different places and see a side of Balie you wouldn't ordinarily see. It was such an educational day, but in a way that was really fun and interesting - we learnt all about the local villages and got to go inside a family compound. We were taken through a rice field and got told about how the ladies were harvesting the rice, and we got to see all the preparations being made for a village cremation which apparently is quite rare. Our guide Ketut (or Joe) was so lovely and it was so interesting talking to him. His English is perfect and he taught us so much about the way of life in Bali - the different class system, village life etc. He answered any questions we asked him and was really keen to tell us as much as he could about everything. It's probably the best tour I've ever been on, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone visiting Bali!"

The tour then Started with a wonderful view of crater lake, marred somewhat by a fairly disappointing 'breakfast' in a mass tourist processing restaurant. Would have preferred a more intimate breakfast experience with better coffee instead of being herded in and out en mass. Then another stop at a coffee plantation/spice village. Parts of it interesting but again, herded in and out en mass. Finally we got on the bicycles and began the best part of the tour! We stopped for a short but very informative tour of a local village. Sadly, we had pelting rain on the day of our excursion, it, but as we live in dubai where it never rains, this didnt detract from the day, as they gave us 'raincoats' . The only problem was that it wasn't easy to take photos of the absolutely stunning scenery while it was raining. My husbands bicycle tyre blew out and they had no replacement so he had to switch bikes to one which didn't have a child seat on the back, which meant our 5 year old had to do the second part of the trip inside the support car. I think bali eco cycling should have been better prepared to fix the blow-out, or switch the child seat to another bicycle. The lunch at the end of the tour was indeed one of the best restaurant meals we had in Bali, with a spectacular view over the rice paddies. I would highly recommend this day-trip to anyone who Wants to see the real bali. Even if you are not a cyclist. The tour is mostly downhill, so is manageable for anyone. The short uphill bits could be walked, if you are not fit."

Joe the guide was fantastic - knowledgeable, enthusiastic, full of information and funny.Breakfast overlooking Lake Batur with Mt Agung in the background was jaw-droppingly beautiful.. You then visit a coffee plantation where the process from raw bean to finished product is simply explained, including the famous Luwak coffee which passes through the digestive system of the Civet. Sounds disgusting but tastes ok, unlike some of the 15 other coffees and teas that they give you to taste. Avoid the Ginseng coffee.Off then on the bikes and it isn't hard cycling as it is all downhill but it takes you through some wonderful countryside where everyone is out working in the rice fields. Ample opportunity to stop and view/actually pitch in at close quarters..lots of smiling faces as you cycle through villages and stop to experience the hidden Bali.The bikes are fit for purpose. They won't win you the Tour de France but so long as the rear brake works then they will get you down the hill. More dangerous are the oncoming motorcycles driven by anyone from 7 to 97.We finished with a delicious buffet, particularly the chicken satay.Overall, this is a really great experience and something you must do if coming to Bali."

(we were staying in Seminyak).A mini van of 9 pax fetches us to \"lake view\" at ubud overlooking a stunning volcano and lake for breakfast. The journey took about 2 hours to reach there. (would recommend to bring a scarf with you as it could turn out a little chilly early morning on top of the mountain, otherwise can always buy a cheap sarong from the local lady at around 5USD)After the breakfast, we were brought to see how the local coffee is made, from the raw coffee beans on the coffee tree, roasting it to tasting it. You can also try the rare luwak coffee (one of the most expensive coffee in the world) by paying a little extra (around 6 USD).Bike tour starts after the stomaches are well-fed by the nice food and coffee. It's quite a easy bike as most of the journey are going down hill. you can go without paddling effortlessly. Truly great experience biking down the country side seeing the \"real bali\".Tour guide Bagus brought us to a local community to visit their home. See how the locals live and their cultures. Scenery along the way is stunning especially when we are riding pass the paddy field. It was so peaceful seeing the green rice field shining under the blue sky. tour ended with the beautiful local balinese buffet lunch before heading back to hotel. Best way to explore the beautiful bali."

They had lovely pancakes, plenty of fruit, a black rice pudding and lovely coffee.From there we went to a coffee plantation and sampled fruits, teas and coffees. I reccommend trying the luwak coffee which, at 60,000 rp was well worth to.From there, we are onto the cycle trip which, at 25 kilometres sounds daunting, however, it is mostly downhill and a very easy ride.We go through the Bali that you would rarely see, take in a tour of a local village and visit a ricefield to witness the intense work that gets taken for granted when you eat your rice in Indonesia.The last part of the trip toward the lunch restaurant is an optional uphill 8 km stretch and it s well worth it.The guides were amazing. My 7 year old had a small bike crash and the guides were off their bikes in a flash to give assistance.The lunch was very nice and at the end of of all, they drop us off at Monkey Forest with entrance fee included.The bikes were of high quality however there were no helmets provided.This was definitely well worth the money and something I would have no hesitation on recommending nor repeating."

A couple of short uphill sections make you look forward to a cold beer, but they are only short. On the way you stop at the biggest Banyan tree in Bali and we got to play soccer with some local kids which was a highlight for me. We had some of Holland and Australia's best players (I think) but the kids beat us! The only slight negative is that one bike did not have adjustable seat height but this was fixed by a swap.

Read earlier reviews and you get the general drift that this is a good operation. Vehicle pick up was fine with very good vehicles.Our guide was informative and friendly. He even laughed at my crappy jokes!Breakfast was good with great views. Coffee plantation was very interesting though the staff got a little pushy with the products in the shop. (But thats their job). Do try the Luwak coffee. $6 but worth the experience. (The Luwak coffee is made from coffee beans that the Civets \"pass\" - you will learn all about it.....)The bikes were fine. Pretty good condition for the use they are put to. Though my wifes gears were a little sticky and this did cause her some problems on the uphill \"option\". Please remember that this is Tour de Bali - not France - so don't expect the latest fine tuned bicycles.The cycling itself very pleasant through small villages and even a short ride in amongst the paddies. Very interesting stop at a local village compound. Gave us a great insight into the traditional Bali way of life. This is why this tour is much more than just a bike ride.So how organised are these people? Very! Drinks and fruit provided on the way. And once the rain eventuated, a brand new plastic poncho was given out to everyone.Lunch was sensational. No, it really was sensational! Probably the best meal I had in my short visit to Bali. Great range of food, plenty of it and very fresh. Well done.So yes, I gave it a 5 star rating. And who am I to rate such a product? Well in an earlier part of my life I was responsible for operating bike tours in India, China, Australia and Vietnam. I understand what makes a good professional tour. These guys have nailed it.

There was so much to eat including a warm black rice pudding with coconut milk. After this we were taken, to a coffee plantation and shown how coffee is made and sampled a variety of beverages. We then arrived to the pick up point to collect our bicycles. This was first come first served, as all of us just went to grab any bike we liked, which only left me with a boys bike, being a girl.

We were all given clear instructions on what to do and safety measures, and basically not go passed the tour guide,as we followed in single file downhill.There was a vehicle behind us in case anyone needed help or just didn't want ride anymore.The ride downhill is exhilarating and so much fun...woohoo!We stopped at a village compound and were taken inside to see how the Balinese live. What a privilege to be inside and learn about how the Balinese live in their day to day living. Further down on our ride we stopped off to see a 500 year old Banyan tree. This was awesome, you could feel the energy of this magnificent tree as you stood inside it. There were Balinese kids playing soccer nearby and a few joined in to play. We were off again and then taken to a rice field where we learned more about this. When we came to the end of the downhill ride, we were given the option of going back up hill for another 8km or go straight to the lunch venue. That was good enough for me. Lunch was a sumptuous buffet with a variety of Balinese dishes including satay and a slow cooked smoked duck. You had a free cool drink and beer was available to buy.There was one incident where someone fell off their bike, but who hasn't come off a bike before? The whole tour cost $35, and that included the huge breakfast and lunch.All in all this was one my highlights in Bali, and would recommend this a must do."

Our guide, Joe, was fantastic and showed us how the real Balinese live outside the city & tourist areas. Our 12 year son joined in with gusto to help thrash the rice. The Indonesian meals were most enjoyable. A chance to try the different teas & coffees including Luwak was great fun. Explanations were spot on. Everyone we passed waved or said halo .DOn't go home without trying this one. Mary, Bernard & Jamie from Auckland, New Zealand"

The pickup was on time and there was no issues whatsoever!The breakfast variety was not exceptional but the quality of what was provided was very good. Not to mention the view, which was fantastic. The coffee plantation visit was interesting but nothing spectacular.The riding downhill was very easy. They even provided helmets. I barely exerted any effort on the downhill and by the end of it all, i felt that my palms were more sore from the constant breaking compared to my legs. The view was good and the explanation provided by the guide on the Balinese way of life was very funny. No complains about the guide who was very accommodating and constantly asked us for feedback along the way.After the downhill part, i opted to continue riding uphill. Due to my general lack of fitness (i work at a desk bound job), i suffered and almost gave up halfway. The only reason i soldiered on was because i was too embarrassed to ask the van to pick me up and everyone else was riding in front of me happily! Haha. But when i finally reached the lunch place, the sense of accomplishment was amazing and the ice cold towel provided was a welcome relief after all that exercise!The food was good but i was frankly too exhausted to eat.All in all, a very good day and highly recommended!"

To make sure you have a brilliant time request Weda (Wed-a) for your guide. He was funny, accommodating, patient and extremely informative.He told us how he was a rice farmer that has taken time away from his normal life to try and earn money for his children\u2019s education and to improve his English. Teach him a new word and you'll see his genuine enthusiasm!The tour is well worth the money, though you can haggle over the phone. I recommend doing the tour early in your holiday, it will get the exploration juice going.Don't be put off by the cycling it really is 95% down hill and if you do get spooked/tired you can ride in the van.Worth waiting a day for the right guide."

Due to the size of the group, there were additional local guides to provide on-site support. Guides from both the company and the on-site guides were helpful and catered to the general pace of the group. The trek was lovely and safe even in the dark. One may wish to note that a basic level of fitness and agility would help in a vertical ascent. Nonetheless, we saw families and young children enjoying the trek.The view at the rest-stop is a sight worth the climb. We reached just before dawn broke and watching the sunrise over a simple yet hearty breakfast was a memorable reward. Some in our group ventured to the summit and witnessed a breath-taking scenery.The climb down was slightly more challenging for one of us with less sense of balance. The company's guide even piggy-backed one of us down to ensure we reached the base safely and in good time. Overall, it was a great experience with helpful and attentive guides and prompt responses from the company."

            "review": "Amazing tour company. On our trip to Bali we did two tours with this company. The first was the Mount Batur Climb and the other was the downhill cycle to Ubud. The climb out to Mount Batur, simply, was the most satisfying thing I have ever done. We were up early in the morning from Seminyak (picked up 1:30 am, a tad earlier then normal as other guests were in more remote hotels). and got to the base around 4am. We scaled the mountain in pitch darkness. I unfortunately am not the most fittest person around and struggled massively. However, one of the guides, a 16 year old boy by the name of Putu, assisted me on the way up. I Embarassingly needed him to help balance myself on the way up, but he helped me getting up there, and more importantly got me back down, despite needing a lot more time then my fellow travellers. Its not an experience I will repeat, but it was such a fantastic thing to do. Basically, if you are a person who struggles to balance on one foot while doing a calf stretch, you will struggle on this. Don't let it deter you though.The downhill cycle was much more easier and a lot more fun. We visited a restaturant with views of Mount Batur and Agung, which was quite nice after doing the mountain tour. After that we visited a coffee plantation and then went to do the downhill ride. You will be amazed with the lush green views on the way down. We stopped at a traditional home, rice fields and a 500 year old tree as well. The optional uphill cycle in the end was interesting. Its not too uphill, but its not easy if you are not a regular bike rider. I would recommend both tours to anyone."

Beautiful scenery, a fantastic, friendly guide (Thanks Joe!), quiet roads, and a great lunch at the end. It was a great way to get away from the hectic pace of more touristy towns and unwind. Even though there were numerous groups doing the same ride we only crossed paths with another group once so it really felt like we had the roads to ourselves. The ride is pretty much all downhill as described but Bali Eco has the option of an additional 8-10km ride at the end that is mostly uphill.

Nearly all of the ride is down hill so you are able to slowly freewheel your way along and take in the country side. The bike ride alone was great but it's all the other activities and inclusions that really make the day. Picked up from legian we drove to the volcano where we had a lovely breakfast on the side of the mountain with breath taking views. From there we then were driven to a plantation where we were able to try all different ices, fruits and coffee and see how it has grown. The price of the trip was worthwhile even now before we actually started the bike ride. The ride was nice and the guide stops you alone the way to look at a Balinese home, locals working in the rice padi's and also a huge banyan tree. At the end you will be driven to their restaurant where they provide you with lunch (included in price) for a delicious lunch. Overall fabulous value for money and I would recommend that everyone do this trip, you won't regret it."

I had researched online looking for the best bali cycling tour which provided an authentic bali experience - this was it! When we arrived to bali we asked our hotel staff to book us onto this tour for the next morning - fuss free. The tour guide picked us up in an van equipped with a/c at 7am (from Legian) and picked up 5 other groups along the way. It was a 1.5-2 hr trip to the breakfast location with a stop over to take photos of beautiful rice terraces. The buffet breakfast was average, serving traditional indo fried rice and condiments, fresh fruit, chocolate or banana pancakes and traditional indo glutinous black rice porridge. The breakfast restaurant was located atop a highpoint overlooking a volcano and lake which was absolutely breathtaking. We then hopped back into the van for another 10 minute drive to a coffee plantation. Here there is a short educational explation about a couple of plants and then an introduction to luwak coffee (possum poo coffee) and how they hand process coffee beans. They also provide a lovely coffee and tea tasting set and you have the option to purchase and sample luwak coffee too. After that you have the opportunity to sample fresh tropical fruit. You then jump back into the van for a minute drive to pick up your bikes. When they say \"downhill bike riding\" they mean it! We literally only needed to pedal about 5 times throughout the entire bike ride, and there are only 3 small uphill parts, the rest is an easy breezy relaxing downhill ride.The tour guide takes you through quaint backstreets through villages and rice fields, first stopping at a traditional Baliness family compound explaining Balinese family traditions. You then ride through a large rice paddy field - great photo opportunity and then take a break at a large banyan tree where you have the opportunity to meet young locals and play a soccer game with them! The ride ends with an amazing and tasty traditional Balinese buffet lunch including rice, mi goreng, smoked chicken & duck, traditional vegetables, gado gado and chicken satay. There's no better way to experience Bali, its beautiful landscapes, its culture and friendly locals. 10/10!"

Our tour leader was very polite and informed us exactly what was happening at all times. On our way to brealfast we had the option of stopping for some quick photos of the landscape which were pretty amazing, but not as amazing as the view for breakfast - overlooking a massive lake and the volcano. Breakfast was traditional indonesian and a delight - try the banana pancakes: yum!After filling our stomaches it was onto the coffee plantation, but not before our guide gave us a lesson in horticulture first! We smelt and tasted some of the plants and leaves and tried to workout what was what - very enjoyable. Included in your tour is a sample tray of teas and coffee. However I recommend shelling out the 60,000rp (aud $6) and trying the famous kopi luwak coffee After trying the coffee it's onto the bike riding.The bikes appear well maintained, a car travels behind incase of breakdown and tgere are plenty of spares. Stops along the way include a bali home and a small school/soccer oval.I choose to continue with a small group & guide to ride uphill to lunch and loved it. Lunch was well deserved and welcomed. We really enjoyed this tour. The price advertised on signs were 360,000rp, however there is a tour lady north of the oval in the main street of ubud selling it for 300,000rp."

It was nice cool going downhill you catch the breeze but make sure you still wear Sun cream as my boyfriend didn't and burnt. We had fantastic stops at a bali home and rice fields where our guide told us lots of interesting things about bali culture. All the friendly locals smiled and said hello to us on our way down. There was an option to cycle up hill to the restaurant for those who wanted to. Lunch was delicious! Plenty to eat and the duck was really tasty. The other people who came on the tour were very friendly which was a bonus. It's always nice to talk to people from other parts of the world. I will be still talking about how great this tour was in years to come!"

Approx $36 Austrailian each. We started with breakfast at the volcano and crater lake - Magnificent view and lovely venue. Then onto a coffee plantation and family compound and an easy ride downhill through the rural areas and rice paddys of Bail. It finshed up with a delicious lunch. Agus (Goose) was our guide. He was very friendly, informative and made lots of jokes - some were funny! haha. I would highly recommend this trip."

The cycling was fun for all of us - young and old! Spectacular breakfast overlooking the volcano, very easy cycling (with a optional extra 8km tour for the eager bikers at the end), interesting insights into the \"true\" Bali and an amazing lunch with the best local food!We saw a few other cycle groups during the day - but they clearly didn't have half as much fun as we did - THANK YOU RING!!!Anyway, if anyone out there is trying to decide which operator to chose, go for these guys!

As our group was assembling the guide took it upon himself to walk around the inside of the property. And then asked us if there was anyone staying in the villa other than our group. It was a really weird question and we were concerned. He was pretty mediocre as a guide. Although some of the other guides were quite good from other groups when I started listening. The equipment was pretty old and my gears didn't work very well. Overall, I would probably choose a different company to do cycling in Bali."

We had breakfast overlooking the volcano and crater lake, visited a plantation where we saw many beautiful plants (coffee, cocoa, vanilla, cinnamon, turmeric, pepper...), watched the coffee beans being sorted (male from female), roasted and ground, sampled teas, coffees and even tobacco (!), rested at a 500 year old banyan tree, cycled through villages where children ran out to greet us with 'hellos', visited a Balinese compound (home to several families and typical of Balinese communal living), watched the rice harvest (absolutely fascinating) and were treated to a feast at the end of our 25km ride.We were even supplied with bananas to keep up our strength, rain capes when it started to rain, cold face flannels at the end of our ride and first aid for any injuries incurred along the way.It was a day I will never forget!"

Breakfast was buffet style overlooking my batur, the food was average and the entire place was covered in fog, so we couldn't see anything.We went to the coffee plantation, which was excellent. We were provided free tasters and ended up buying a vanilla and coconut coffee. Prices were about 112k RP for each.On the cycling part, we stopped off at a traditional village which was very interesting.About half an hour later, it was pouring down with rain, thunder and lighting, but we rode on through which was excellent. The roads were washing down all bits of rubbish though. The poncho provided didn't do much for keeping dry. Dinner was another buffet and the food was very yummy, and it had stopped raining. I think we were supposed to go to monkey forest after, but as our group were soaking, I think everyone was fed up and wanted to go home. We've already been so we didn't miss out on anything.A great day out, but I would like to warn people about the buffet food. If you're concerned about bali Bali belly (food poisoning), dont eat much from the buffets. You don't know how long the food has been sitting there. Although I was ok, my husband has suffered really bad from this and it has now ruined the last day and a half."

            "review": "Mt Batur = Great, Bali Eco Cycling = a little disappointing. Firstly, I would say definitely do the Mt Batur sunrise tour when you are in Ubud. It's not super hard but definitely challenging if you are unfit like me! Views are great.My \"average\" rating is because several parts of the tour as listed on their website were NOT valid and service was a little below par.1. There were 5 of us in our little group and all of us were told the incorrect time for pick up (they arrived between 30-45mins later than scheduled, which is I supposed normal Bali time but at 2am is prettttty annoying)2. We did not have 2 guides as stated on their website (ie English speaking Bali Eco guide and a compulsory local guide)3. Our guide was a sweet little guy, but his English was pretty atrocious, We could barely understand him and he could only understand about a quarter of our questions. So pretty much aside from pidgin English describing where Mt Agung was and what was a crater, we didn't get much out of it. It was us who had to prompt and ask him what certain things were etc and even then sometimes the answer was as though he was answering something completely different so for half of the time we were sort of confused. I probably wouldn't have tipped him if he hadn't held out his hand at the end as I was pretty disappointed but he had just done a 5 hour slog so I did give him a small tip.3a --> He was a very sweet guy though and we all opted for the \"long trek\" around a few extra craters and he would pick out spots for us to jump up to take photos which we probably wouldn't have thought to do as we were all exhausted but also focusing alot on not falling over and interpreting what he was saying!4. I presumed we would get to cook the eggs in the steam vents ourselves based on the description on their website (two other people in my group were also under this impression). Basically, the eggs up top may as well have been boiled in a pot for all I knew. I'm not even into eggs so it was pretty disappointing not to see the method. (Oh but the banana sandwiches we got were surprisingly good)So I guess, if you are going to do the Mt Batur Trek then an English speaking guide will enhance your experience threefold! It's still a beautiful trip regardless."

This was a great experience, even for someone like me who hasn't been on a bike for more than 15 years!This guided tour is probably half cycling and half other activities (including breakfast at Kintamani overlooking the volcano and visit to a coffee plantation) so don't expect to be riding all day. See the Bali Eco Cycling brochure for a very good overview of the tour. Our guide, Gusti, was incredible. His English was outstanding. He was very knowledgeable and witty and eager to share his knowledge of Balinese culture. The guides will pick you up and drop you back to your accommodation. The equipment (bikes, helmets) seemed okay, although there were a few problems with chains coming off the cogs and the brakes were squeaky. We had one guide up front leading us and one guide at the back to make sure everything was ok, so we felt safe at all times. The meals were outstanding! The breakfast at Lake View in Kintamani was great (excellent nasi goreng and pancakes!), and the lunch was easily the best Indonesian cuisine we had in our three weeks in Bali. Overall, it was a great experience and a perfect way to see traditional Bali while taking in some fresh air! About half the price compared to other almost identical tours as well!If i could recommend anything it would be to do this early on when you get to Bali, the reason being that some of the activities you will go on in this tour are often featured in other guided tours (like the coffee plantation tour and rice fields). This way, you can more easily alter your personal day trips to get more out of your time in Bali! For example, everyone in our group had already been to a coffee plantation and tried to Lewak coffee, so it didnt really have the same impact second time around!!Also, don't get your hotel to book the tour for you! Or at least be warned that many of the hotels have been approached by other bike tours and offered a commission to book with them! Indeed, the staff at the Payogan in Ubud tried to dissuade us to go on the Bali Eco Tour and go on a different one. We are happy that we did not agree to this!"

Most of us even did the optional 10km cycle ride uphill after the 25km downhill part. I would only do the 10km ride back if you are of strong fitness. If you dont want to do the 10km extra, then the bus will take you back instead. The lunch of Bali Duck was superb. I would suggest only doing this tour if you are staying in Ubud as the journey time there and back is shorter."

            "review": "How has this got such good reviews?. I went on this trip after reading the good reviews and looking at the companies website. I was interested in riding through small rural villages and seeing the rural Bali, his did not happen. Why do people like this large scale touristy activity? I can only imagine that this tour used to be through small villages and small roads before it got so popular. There must have been 7-9 van loads of people on the day I went, say 70 or so people all cycling the same roads at the same time.Positives: Our guide \"Win\" was very enthusiastic, funny in his distinct way and informed. He really added to what was a poor trip and did his best for everyone. Ask for him if you want a laugh. Also it was not expensive, I paid 250,000 through my accommodation but if you call direct at this time of year (May 2013) you can get it for 225,000. Don't pay the 350,000 per the website.Disappointments: Main issue was that the cycling was not really through the quiet rural areas as described, but on quite large roads (for Bali). We rode past a few rice paddies but not through the fields of crops as described on the website. Second issue was the number of people doing the trip all riding round the same circuit together....it didn't feel like the \"real Bali\" but another tourist trap. The breakfast was very average, worse than I would have got if I would have had my free breakfast at my (cheap) bungalow. It was buffet style in a large tourist restaurant. However the view was excellent over Mt Batur. It was fruit, banana pancakes (with very little banana), rice pudding (like it) and fried rice. Lunch, described as a real highlight on the website was average luke warm tourist buffet food at a large tourist restaurant like you get on all large group tours. The smoked duck and chicken was warm and greasy. We got one tiny bit of chicken bbq each, this was good but less than one mouthful. I was expecting smaller \"real Balinese\" places not these large tourist buffets.Overall don't bother. Hire a moped or bike and head out into the countryside around Bali yourself. Then you'll see the real Bali not an ersatz representation."

They serve it from a special coffee brewer at your table. You also get to try many different fruits (that I wish our hotels served at breakfast!) Then you walk through the store, as they really want you to buy coffees, teas, etc. But, they aren't aggressive, and we didn't buy anything.You then get fitted for your bicycle. Bikes weren't great, but decent. Try to make sure your bike fits well and everything is working before leaving parking lot. Otherwise, guides will do their best to fix, but might have to wait for van to bring another bike if major problem or fit uncomfortable.The ride through the countryside is wonderful. The guide takes you through rice fields and villages. You visit a a typical villager's home, a temple, a rice processing area, and a rice field. The guide explains everything very well.Lunch turned out to be great! I expected an average buffet, but it was delicious. We are vegetarian and they made two special items for us to replace two things we couldn't eat on the buffet. The food was fresh, hot, and delicious. Time for conversation with other customers in a pretty open air setting (in the shade!).I would highly recommend this company. Price was reasonable and we throughly enjoyed ourselves."

I certainly did not expect flash bikes but was pleased that they appeared in the condition that they were in. By the end of the ride though my hands were sore from braking so suggested better hand grips for future. Thanks goodness it was down hill most of the way. The stops were well placed for breaks. The guide we had was very informative. I learnt a lot about how the community of Bali works. I know now why my son is so difficult his bad attitude was not filed away from his teeth. My friend and I failed dismally when it came to the 2 up hill runs we blame the wrong gear selection thank goodness it was only a couple of short up hill runs. When we arrived at the destination to come off the bikes I was really pleased to get the icy cool face washer it was great. I did not like the sellers they were far to pushy and I had to escape them by getting to our van as quick as I could. The lunch we had was fantastic all reports to this are true very yummy.

If you want more comfort, bringing your own seats, gloves and helmets helps. Have recommended Bali bike touring to all my friends and will definitely use this company again. The hotel staff where I was at at Bali was surprised at the price : \"all the other operators charge more\". And there is nothing lacking here- we had lunch, breakfast and the sampler tray of 11 cups of coffee and tea thrown in. If I may say so there were 2 things I noticed that could improve:1.at the beginning of the cycling portion we went on gravel for about 15 min- I noticed 2 ladies who struggled. Seems tougher than what they expected. They were wearing flip flops and probably not the best for cycling in such terrain. Could be informed in advance: what to wear.2. The talks in the garden at the Luat farm were interesting but the place is mosquito infested. Insect repellant provision Or advisory in advance will help a lot. I had lots of repellant but didn't apply any that day as I thought it's just cycling and walks through padi fields. Could be informed in advance: what to bring.To be fair maybe such were on their website. Perhaps reminders via emails would help. Anyway their response viz emails were the best of the 3 companies I found on the net and wrote to. V timely and on the ball. Top marks to them. Looking forward to returning soon w friends in tow."

They made sure that we were with other families with children, so that our Only had the opportunity to socialise, and we made new friends too. We were greeted at the end by the owner and his wife, and the meal was THE best meal I had while in Bali. My friend recommended that we use this tour company, and so booked online, and it was efficiency personified from start to finish. There were many hiccups on our first trip to Bali, and Eco Tours was NOT one of them.....simply wonderful. I would take something to give to the children you meet on the way through, what a special opportunity and privilege it was to meet a typical Balinese family and be allowed in their home to gain understanding of the culture. Excellentx"

Our guide, Joe, was fantastic- he was energetic and fun and shared many interesting facts about the Balinese culture that I wasn't learning elsewhere. I was apprehensive about the safety of bicycling in Bali after experiencing the crazy traffic in many places, but this tour takes you on back roads with little traffic, with interesting stops along the way to interact with locals, and a real chance to see and be in the beautiful landscape. Their restaurant had delicious food in a lively setting. If I have an opportunity to return to Bali, I will try one of their other trips."

You will see places which you would never have opportunity to see by yourself, and explained / presented the real life of Balinese people. The knowledge that you get from the tour will not be forgotten. This is great experience from cycling but also educational point of view.This is tour dedicated for everyone in any age range.Few words about the guide we had (Wede) - best guide ever I had during any kinds of trips. He is very proffesional and it can be seen that what he does come from his heart. He is very patience, warm welcoming any questions form the group.In overall- amazing views- good education- nice (not tiring) cycling - this is downhill all the way long- good breakfast and lunch during the tour (rich buffet)Considering the above - price is just great and this is 'must see' tour!"

I will try to keep this brief as I really just wanted to echo what many other reviewers have said - this is a superb trip with a great mix of things to see. The cycling is virtually all downhill and although 25km sounds like a long way, as long as you can balance yourself on a bike the hill will do most of the work for you - we really aren't that fit and found it no trouble. There is an optional extra 8km uphill at the end if you want it, but we went straight for lunch! The food was excellent as well, a welcome change from the usual small plate of something boring you tend to get on day trips. The price of IDR 350,000 per person was reasonable."

My elder 2 boys thoroughly enjoyed him. The ride was relaxing and very easy going. We learnt so much going through the compound, and the guide was very informative.

I particularly enjoyed visiting a typical village compound, and getting a sense of Balinese communal living and community connections. Our guide's excellent command of English coupled with his extensive knowledge and good humour made the trip especially worthwhile. And it was excellent value for money. Note, though: the ride was mostly down-hill but had a few small hills that presented a challenge for some, and a walk to get up the slope. But this shouldn't be a deterrent to a wonderful experience."

We were picked up from our hotel (in Seminyak) and enjoyed the drive (in a slightly worse-for-wear mini van) up to the mountains, especially meeting and chatting to the other riders. The sightseeing prior to the rides was lovely: Lake Batur, the rice paddies and the herb farm. I traveled with my Mum who hadn't ridden a bike for some 50 years and I hadn't ridden for around 30 years, so there was some trepidation initially, however, once we got going it was all good. As my Mum has a medical condition that precludes a great deal of exertion, Bali Eco Cycling kindly arranged for Mum to have a tandem bike so she had a great time doing some cycling but with the help of \"Fast\" Eddie. Our guide for the day, Wayan, was terrific and knowledgeable. I especially loved being able to go into a compound in a village to see how the rural Balinese families live. As I mentioned, I had not ridden a bike for such a long time but managed riding on the road with no problems, at the end there were a couple of off-road sections that I was little less able to manage but I just walked them (they were short and v pretty). I was a little slow at times but felt comfortable and not under pressure to keep up or anything. I really recommend the bike tour as an experience and also recommend Bali Eco Cycling as a great company to do it with as they were very accommodating of our needs / experience level etc. Rgds Fiona"

The guide was knowledgeable about just about everything that has to do with Bali. The flora, fauna, culture, traditions etc. Our kids (7-years old) loved snorkelling (feeding the colourful fish), spotting dolphins and walking through the jungle. They also enjoyed being around the guide and the driver who gave them full attention, carried them when there was tricky terrain and even played chess with them. The accommodation along the way was fantastic. Especially in Ahmed. We really felt well taken care of and will definitely book another tour with Bali Eco on our next visit to Bali!"

The hike tour was great, however the web site does say it is an easy hike. Having hiked the Grand Canyon twice and Half Dome it is not an easy hike. The description of the hike on the web site is misleading, not to scare anyone just be informed, it is in the dark with a flashlight over loose lava and at times pretty steep. We had some folks in our group wearing flip flops. I don't believe they made it to the top and I have no idea how they made it down. Make sure you wear appropriate shoes, bring some snacks and enjoy the amazing sunrise view. Having gone on 2 tours with Eco Cycling, we did stop at the same coffee plantation on both trips, glad it wasn't too long of a stop the 2nd time.

We were informed that the entire ride was downhill and we set off on a lovely half days journey. We stopped often for photos and also at a typical extended family compound for a visit and photos. The last leg of the ride is downhill as well or the optional 8 kilometer uphill trek for the hardier souls. My wife and I chose the uphill portion and made it hot and sweaty for our delicious buffet style lunch. The guides were very friendly and knowledgeable and the pace of the ride would be well suited for any level of cyclist.Bring sunscreen, water (which is also provided for you) and a camera.

The cost was a bargain at $36Aud (360,000rp) for the whole day. The driver and guide from Eco tours, picked up our family of 6 in a comfortable airconditioned minivan from Sanur at about 7.30am We met another man who had been picked up previously from Kuta. We drove about an hour to a great restaurant at Kintamani overlooking the stunning Mt batur and Crater lake. It was a buffet style breakfast, with crepes, small cakes, fruit, soup, black sticky rice pudding, noodles, juice, tea and bali coffee. Our guide talked to us about the volcano and the surrounding towns. We then drove on to the coffee place, where you are taken through their gardens and shown how various local produce are grown, ie Kayu manis (cinnamon), salak, cloves, cocoa, coffee etc. You are then shown the small luwak animals (like a cross between a possum and a raccoon) who are in somewhat cramped cages. They are fed the raw coffee bean and then their faeces is collected and the coffee bean extracted. Apparently this process changes the whole dynamics of the coffee bean which is then roasted. We were shown how they hand roast the coffee beans and the difference between luwak beans and not. We then were seated in an area where a tray of all different coffees and teas were brought out for free tasting. You can pay an extra 50,000rp ($5Aud) to try a cup of the luwak. After finishing the tea tasting we were then taken to a small area ajoining the shop for a free taste of the local fruits ie mango, salak (snake fruit) dragon fruit etc. We were then able to wander through the shop (selling luwak coffee, various teas, incenses and oils) if we wanted to (not compulsory or forced but if you do go through you usually have a Balinese boy/girl following you around. Their prices are way over what you pay elsewhere but we bought something small as a token of thanks for the tour of their farm & the free tea & fruit tasting. Next to the place where the bikes are kept. We picked out bikes which were adjusted for us and helmets selected. They have some children seats if requested. We were given bottles of water and then we were on our way. Its just about all down hill with my peddles hardly being used (brakes needed all the time) It was so good to travel through all the quiet narrow back roads of the Ubud villages like this. Sometimes we would be passed by cars but we had plenty of warning from the guide in front or behind so we never felt in danger or occasionally we would pass the local children who would wave and call hello as we passed. We stopped at a typical balinese\u2019s family home (on the poorer side of the average Balinese) Were we were shown around and told about the positioning of the family rooms, temples, kitchens etc. We then wandered in next door where we were shown the family\u2019s livelihood, making bamboo mats. We then cycled on and took a detour through some pretty rice paddys (aren\u2019t all rice paddys pretty) where we stopped our bikes to be shown how the rice paddy systems work and either plant some rice or pick some raw rice if we wanted to, depending on the season. We then continued on bike down the path cut through the rice paddy\u2019s until we joined the road again. We continued riding down hill and stopped at a huge banyan tree that is worshiped in the village for its age. Here we were given a snack of biscuits if we wanted them. We then got back on our bikes for the last part of the trip which ended after crossing a bridge over a stream. We could continue the trip with an 8km uphill trip if we wanted, (Not many do that bit). The cold towels at the end were a welcome relief. We then left our bikes for the last time and were taken by minibus to a huge open sided restaurant where we had a lovely meal of traditional bali fare including sate sticks, noodles etc more food than we could eat. A small can of fizz was included but extra for beer or other things. Overall it was a fantastic day, one which I recommend to bali repeaters as well as first timers."

Joe was a great guide and we learnt a lot about the Balinese culture. Towards the end of the ride you have the option of riding for another 8 km (mostly uphill) to the restaurant or catching the mini-bus. We elected to ride the extra distance which was great but just be aware that the early afternoon sun is fierce and make sure you are well prepared and drink lots of water (I wilted despite being reasonably fit!). The lunch provided was oustanding - some of the best food we had in Bali. Our only negative comment is that the bikes could be better maintained - and the seats are very hard!"

Maybe adding the cycling would have made it a more exciting tour."

Our guide 'Joe' (Ketut) spoke perfect English and provided a fascinating and entertaining insight to the way Balinese live. The day starts with breakfast overlooking one of the volcanos and lake. Next we headed over to check out the infamous Kopi Luwak - the coffee beans digested by civet cat. If not your thing, there are plenty of other flavours of tea and coffee to try. Once on the bikes, you meander through beautiful countryside, passing plantations, villages, schools and scores of children eager to greet you or jostling for a high 5 as you pass. There are several stops along the way to offer some more insights into Balinese life and some wonderful photo opportunities! The ride itself is very easy - really is all downhill (i think I pedalled around 5 times). If you want something a bit more energetic there is an optional 8km of 'moderate uphill' at the end, but otherwise you can continue to cruise downhill into lunch. All the necessary inclusions are provided - water, helmets, fruit and also some greatly appreciated cold towels once we had finished. This tour is great value, well run and a very enjoyable way to see Bali!"

If you need more adrenaline- not a problem- there is an upslope option for you to challenge yourself. if you are not up for the challenge, you can just cycle downhill (main trail).The size of the group was very cozy (about 10 of us).We got to see \"village\" life- and it is not those touristy things where they put some \"locals' on display. We cycled through padi fields, villages, schools and temples. Lovely. The guide always had something to share about the places we past- which was very educational.Half-way through it drizzled, but not to worry, there was a mini van following us from behind carrying boxes of disposable raincoat. i was impressed.at the end of the tour, they had cold hand towels for us to wipe down and refresh. it's little touches like these that differentiates this tour group from the rest.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"

You're in good hands with attentive tour leaders who are generous in sharing their Balinese culture and village knowledge. If you're arriving from Kuta or Depasar, the journey is to Ubud is shorter. My starting point was from Nusa Dua (deeper south) so be ready to zonk out. Upon arrival, the breakfast was delicious and the panoramic view of the deep forest was special. For the more hardcore cyclists, you have the option to go on a power cycle for a few Ks (guided by a pro) during one section of the tour while the rest hop onto a bus to the next point. It rained halfway through my booked trip but that's no biggie. I think the added chaos just made it alot more fun! Highly recommended no doubt."

There are always 2 guides in a group, a van and a bicycle truck following us. When a friend of mine had a flat tire, one of the guide gave his bicycle to him and he was left waiting for the bicycle truck to bring him a new one. in 5 minutes the second guide had joined the group again.although they said they had 8 groups that morning, we did not see other groups and we felt that the van and the truck served us where as they served several groups.we ended the tour in beatiful spot and were taken to a delicous lunch buffet provided special by the company...I'd love to do it again any time Iin Bali."

Our young guide spoke excellent English and was amazingly knowledgeable about everything we encountered on the trip. It was mainly (90%) downhill with just a few hills to pedal up, but it was lovely that most of the ride was on local roads and paths. The tour only caters for small groups (max.10), so we were able to get to know our fellow travellers along the way. Everything is very relaxed with plenty of eco stops where the guide would explain the culture and the agriculture. I did have a fall right at the end of the 3 hour trip (probably through fatiue) but the guide cand his colleague were with me in seconds to check that nothing was broken and to carry out running repairs. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this trip to all visitors - it's a great experience."

Next the tour guide and drivers took us to a local coffee plantation to explain how the famous Luwok coffee is produced, and you're able to sample it on-site in their cafe for $60K RPE (=$6 USD), and also comes with 12 free tea/coffee tastings and free local tabacco you can roll yourself and smoke. Then we were taken to be fitted for our bikes and helmets, and were given a spectacular bike tour through the Ubud countryside, through local villages, temples, and rice paddies. Ketut Joe is extremely knowledgeable, and even provided us access to stop and enter a local resident's home (something friends who had taken the tour separately earlier in the week with a different guide did not receive). To see how the local Balinese live was a once in a lifetime experience, and they are so welcoming. We learned about how their home is set up, history...etc, and told of local traditions. We even got to see a completed oogah oogah the village was making for the upcoming Nyepi festival - simply amazing how much work goes into these! We continued biking and stopped to actually walk on to a rice paddy and speak with the workers (got to shuck a bunch of rice for a quick photo opp), and then taken to a rice production facility where we were explained the share cropping process. Finished the day with a buffet lunch at a local restaurant with amazing food overlooking the rice paddy. All in all, we started at 7:45am and finished at 3:45pm for a full day of sight-seeing and learning. And it only cost $36 for the whole thing.I cannot recommend Ketut Joe more highly. He is Balinese and speaks excellent English (with an Australian accent), very knowledgeable, and great sense of humor."

Then we were taken to an eco farm to taste a variety of Balinese coffees & tropical fruits. It took around 21/2 hours for the riding to start...all downhill! Going through the villages was really educational an eye opener for us and our 3 children, particularly entering a family compound. Lunch at the end of the ride was one of the best meals on the holiday - I know we'd worked up an appetite but it was really yummy.The guides on the tour were fantastic, knowledgable & friendly.

Sports shoes are encouraged, be careful as the walk may get the shoes muddy- Lotsa cycling downhill (effortless) as we whizz past Balinese compounds, scenic views of local women rice harvesting etcLunch included is a hearty Balinese buffet.If you enjoy outdoors, experiencing a non-touristy Bali, good to give this tour a shot."

I certainly recommend a sturdy pair of shoes, since the trail is not a developed trail, and at parts you are scrambling up rocks. I wore layers and that worked out well, being chilly in the morning and able to shed layers during the hike; and since I didn't wear any clothing made from cotton, I wasn't chilled with wet clothing while waiting for the sun to peep out from behind the clouds. Our EcoCycling guide was awesome, he actually carried one of the people in our group down the steep part of the mountain.

Then the biking is great fun, with an added uphill 8kms for the more active. We did this, and it is tough going but worth it. Also get to go inside a Balinese compound and see families at work and play which is a beautiful experience and we felt quite honoured to be able to be there. Rice paddies are also visited where one is allowed to work with the ladies out in the fields and then continue to the Rice Processing Plant. I really appreciated this (being in the sustainable/international development field), being able to witness and understand more of the collectivist culture and how everyone works but ensures that those in other parts of the chain are not left with a raw deal. It was great... Oh and the lunch is probably one of the best meals I ate the entire trip in Indonesia. So tasty!"

            "review": "Unbelievable!!!!. This tour is an absolute must do when in Bali.We were looking for a tour that took us to see the real Bali and this cycling tour ticks every box. From Kuta it is about two hours up through Ubud to the mountains. The drive is pleasant and some of the scenery is amazing. Breakfast at Mt Batur is lovely and the scenery is breathtaking. After breakfast the tour heads to a coffee and cocoa plantation to sample local coffee and tea. The samples are free and for a small fee (60.000Rp) you can taste the Luwak (poo coffee) which is worth it if only to say that you have tried.After the coffee the cycling starts. It is an amazing journey through the back blocks of Bali and is just as the website and brochure describes. Our guide for the day, Git Git, spoke excellent English and was a wealth of knowledge on Balinese culture, history and customs. The stop at the traditional Balinese compound and the rice paddies were particularly interesting. The cycling is all down hill and really doesn't require a great level of fitness at all. The bikes are in reasonable condition considering the amount of work that they do. At the end of the downhill there is the option to ride the uphill stretch the lunch venue. This about 8km steady uphill ride and requires a reasonable level of fitness but our 11 year old son was able to complete it comfortably.The lunch venue is beautiful with a wonderful buffet to replenish the energy levels after the ride. The tour is exceptional value and is the highlight of our holiday!!!!"

The breakfast near Mt Batur is amazing, the food was beautiful but the view is outstanding. Everything the brochure and website describe is spot on. We visited all the places mentioned and had a lovely guide called Weda. He has a great sense of humour, good English and some great factual information. The cycling is mostly downhill. We had a group of 8 people all at various fitness levels, all had a great time. There is only very light traffic in the back streets they use. I never felt uncomfortable at all. There was no stopping at any push selling shops on commission just coffee in a beautiful setting. Will definitely recommend to others. Next time I will take my kids. Awesome day out."

He had lots of funny anecdotes about coffee, herbs.. and everything (almost tricked me to eat a hot green chilly, calling it Balinese green-berry). The breakfast overlooking a volcano was really tasty.Stops at rice fields, Balinese compound etc were informative. We learned about the culture, religion, farming. that was something I would have not necessarily found out myself.Bikes were in a good condition and the route (99% downhill) was almost free of traffic.In the end we were treated with a really nice lunch."

I'm not sure about the relevance of the 'eco' part of the tour but all the same, it was just a great day out. The cycling part of the tour was well into the morning but that was fine too, as the bus ride up the hill was interesting. There are about 10 people in each group, so you get time to interact with each other and the guide who was fantastic. I enjoyed his puns as well as his commentary. Breakfast overlooking Lake Batur was great--sensational views. Later on the coffee tasting was also good. The bike riding was really easy. Stopping off at the traditional village/family was a real eye opener, as were the stops at a couple of rice paddies. There was adequate time to look, ask questions, take photos and see what a more traditional village might be like. The optional uphill ride was a lot of fun, even in the pouring rain! Lunch was also really tasty. I'd have to say this was one of the best organised tour activities I have been on. The whole day thing was run like a well oiled machine. Everything was taken care of: water, raincoats, food, helmets... really interesting and a whole lot of fun, and at $A36 each is incredibly good value. Well done to all involved."

I will skip the tour description part, BaliEco does it very well on their own website, and unlike another providers I had experience with in Bali, you get exactly what they promise, no nasty surprises. My son and myself had a fantastic time, and the food buffet was superb even beyond my expectations.The ride is very easy, there's virtually no pedalling involved, so it would suit even the unfittest of all. Unexperienced riders should be aware though that there is still some local traffic, while they take you through side roads that aren't extremely busy, you will still get a few scooters and occasional cars that will overtake you. Photo-maniacs like myself will be rewarded with vast opportunities for photography along the way - conveniently, there is an extra person following behind the column to make sure no one gets lost if they choose to stop for a while. The bus follows behind as well, so if one brings bags that they don't want to carry while on the bike, they can be left on the bus."

He gave us so much information and was very friendly. The majority of the biking is downhill; however, they have this solid 8km uphill climb that is intense. If you are staying in Ubud or outside; this is a worth while excursion to see Ubud and to meet the local people."

The tour is fairly affordable and you will get to see so much more of the island than you would be able to see on your own. Our tour guide was great and easy to talk to so we learned a lot about the real Bali and not just what most tourists see. Both hotels we stayed in were pretty nice, the one in Amed was right on the beach and we were able to walk right out and snorkel their reef. The Dolphins in Lavinia were so beautiful and I really enjoyed getting to see so many different beautiful temples. Cannot recommend this company enough, a great way to see Bali."

If you are a little asthmatic you should consider not taking this up or start lot early as you could be slow in climbing up.It took us around 2 hours 45 minutes to go up. My sister was asthmatic and hence we were slow to climb. But the climb was worth it, what stunning views we had..Remember to have good trek shoes as we heard couple of sad stories (a fall to death and another of a death due to heart attack)..

It was raining and raincoats were provided. It was all downhill and everyone took it easy due to the weather. Thankfully the rain did stop and the rest of the ride was warm. We rode through local areas that we would not have seen if it wasn't for this tour. While riding, the bus followed with a truck for the bikes. Anyone who had had enough could have gotten into the bus. Once at the bottom on the hill anyone who wanted to keep riding could ride up a hill to the lunch stop while the rest of the crew caught the bus back. While it was more than just the hill, I was grateful for the exercise."

Aside from the cycling there was the visit to the coffee plantation with added tutorial on local herbs and their uses, think turmeric, cloves etc. the view of the caldera at the volcano is something heard about but rarely seen. We were blessed. Our guide was wonderful and very knowledgable. Seriously worth every cent spent on this trip. Go Enjoy!"

Although I have lived in Bali for 3 years, this is the first time that I have done this tour. I simply loved it - being a little long in the tooth (almost 66), and not having been on a bike for a long, long time, I found it a little hard to get on and off the bike, but the guide who was at the back was there to help me, with a smile. Otherwise I had no problems, and kept up with the group, so all you oldies, get on a bike with Bali Eco Cycling Tours, and enjoy a day in the country side. I dare say that you'll be hard pressed to find another (more or less) full day tour, inclusive of transport, breakfast, snack and lunch for Rp360.000 (about $36). Our guide Wida was very informative, and I think guests for whom it's their first trip to Bali, would have learned a lot about the way the Balinese live, and how Hinduism is part of every aspect of their lifes."

Our tour guide picked us up from our hotel and drove us the over 2hour trip through the beautiful heartland of Bali. When we arrived at breakfast it was overlooking a beautiful volcano- the view is stunning! Breakfast was quite nice the mangos were delicious. We then we taken to a small coffee place where our tour guide Wayum taught us about the different foods they produce in Bali and you get free tastings of coffee, tea and fruit... Note that after this experience you have to look in the gift shop and the shop ladies follow you around with a shopping basket begging you to buy- we didn't but felt quite awkward for not. After this the bike ride starts where you ride downhill 95% of the way. You basically have the breaks on the whole way! Beautiful scenery and very little traffic on the roads. You are actually only riding for about 2 hours. The highlight was going into a Balinese home where our guide taught us about the Balinese live. Our guide Wayum was so informative! Any question we had he could answer- so ask lots of questions. After the ride we had the most beautiful lunch which also included a complimentary soft drink and even dessert! For roughly $35 Australian it's the best value for money in Bali. Highly recommend!"

Our guide RIng was one of the best guides I have ever had anywhere. How can I say that? On our tour, it was pouring rain (buckets!) and it STILL was an awesome time. Even though we were all soaking wet by the time we arrived at the lunch spot, Ring's endless enthusiasm and informative explanations of Bali culture and society kept us interested and motivated. Well equipped operators, complete with safety van, waterproof gear, and helmets. (Although for some reason nobody in our group chose to wear helmets because when you're riding downhill on unfamiliar roads on an unfamiliar bike in a blinding rainstorm in a foreign country, what could possible go wrong, right?) Pit stops were educational, not just an excuse for the foreigners to be paraded through the gift shop. Highlights include breakfast on the volcano, sampling \"Cat-poo-chino\" at a coffee plantation, and a visit to a Balinese home where Ring answered questions and gave some real insight (good and bad) into the socio-economic situation for Balinese families. No real negatives to speak of, a great time all around."

The tour guide unfortunately i cannot remember his name but he was super. Very informative, knowledgeable and his command of English was the best I've encountered from a tour guide in Bali. Pick up and transport was in a suitable and clean modern vehicle with working air con. We travelled up into the mountain to have breakfast at a location with terrific views of a volcano, lake and lava flow tracks from the last eruption. First stop was a coffee plantation. While you may wonder what this has to do with cycling it doesn't. It is however 'eco' and the guide introduces you to a number of flora and explains what Balinese people use them for. At the end free coffee/tea samples are provided i think 16 in total which as a non coffee drinker i found pretty nice bar two of the stronger coffee flavours. Also for 60,000 you can have a pot of coffee Lowak which is the rare and expensive Civit poo coffee. From there we went to our bike station where we kitted up. Bikes are obviously not brand new but there were not any problems. Padded seat covers were available on request and i'd recommend asking. The journey is 95% down hill so breaks are all you need it is quite nice and cool due to the breeze as you cycle but don't be fooled... wear your sun lotion. We stopped at a village home complex and were invited in and told about different things within. My advice is Ask Ask Ask. The more you ask the more the guide will tell. Our guide was able to answer every question and he came across in having a genuine interest in educating us on Balinese life. The poverty of course is noticeable but you will not be asked for any money as the tour contributes to the village. The occupants were not at all phased by our presence and while i felt i was encroaching this soon passed. From here you travel onwards stopping for photos along the route all in all a few hours cycling broken up with stops. You end at a restaurant which serves buffet lunch, this was Indonesian food but it was very tasty and nothing to complain about. A great trip with views of lush paddy fieldsand forest and a great guide who taught our group of 5 a lot we didn't previously know. "

Then we got our bikes and rode to see a Bali village and saw how a family lives. Met a 93 year old woman. Then we went to the rice fields and helped Bali ladies hull the rice. The ride itself was pretty easy, good pace and mostly down hill. There was an option at the end to ride up hill to go to the restaurant or go on the bus. Then they took us for lunch which was really good food. Then they offered whoever wanted to go to the monkey forest and paid for the entrance. Overall very good experience and great service. We also did the trekking with them to Mt. Batur, the tour guide Wayan was very nice but a little shy so not as fun as Ring. The trek up was about 2 hours in the dark so bring a headlamp. They do provide flashlights. It was hard at time but lots of fun and definitely worth it on the end to see the amazing sunrise. The breakfast sucked, just 1 egg and a white bread banana sandwich. After a trek like that I would like to have at least 3 eggs and bacon. The hike down was harder because we were more tired. Overall great company and wonderful experience. The sunrise was beautiful."

I was slightly daunted by the prospect of cycling 25km (surely not), but was assured it was all downhill. I was pleasantly surprised that it was quite an easy ride and we saw amazing sights along the way. Certainly a must do in Ubud. The breakfast at the volcano was lovely, followed by the coffee plantation, then on to the bikes. Riding through all the villages and visiting a traditional family compound was fantastic, then we visited many sites including local industries of wood carvers and rice fields. This all ended with a excellent buffet lunch. Must do!"

With the sunrise u need to be lucky weather wise -we were:-) and the view was so worthwhile getting picked up and climbing a vulcano in the middle of the night!!The cycling tour started with a delicious breakfast overlooking Lake Batur and the mountains... And then we got to see the making of the most expensive coffee before we headed downhill on our bikes! And downhill it is, there r if it even comes up to 5 little parts where I actually had to go uphill!! There were interesting stops on the way and heaps of rice fields. The tour ended with the best Balinese meal I had in 2weeks...simply amazing!! Definitely a MUST DO!!"

It's all down hill which makes the trip easy and fun. You also stop at a place that make and grow there own coffee. So for all the coffee lovers out there you get 6 free cups of different fresh coffee. Yum! You will also get to experience the really bali and visit with the locals in there home. Our guide Dharma was lots of fun and very informative. Without him our day would not have been the same. I will definitely be doing it again the next time I go to bali."

            "review": "Guys, you are the best!. The cycling tour from Bali Budaya is a highlight of our trip to Bali this time. Fantastic routes, scenery, educational information, lots of fun. Very happy to have had a Balinese guide. Cycling was easy - 25km rolling down, barely pedaled at all. Everything they state on the website about the tour is true - for instance, both breakfast and lunch were not the cheap options included in other tours, but good quality places. The breakfast was at the Lakeview restaurant with a breathtaking view over Mt Batur, Mt Agung and the lake, and the lunch was at a nice place near Ubud surrounded by two small rice fields, with lots of smoked duck, satey and other delicacies. After breakfast we visited a coffee plantation where we heard about various local plants and sampled 8 hot drinks including the famous Luwak coffee. The guide was very entertaining when presenting the plans :-) Then we started off with the bikes in a nearby village, rode and walked through the rice fields, visited a Balinese compound (a very poor one it seems, it was a bit depressing to see the mother and the child watching us tourists go through and the visit felt a bit intrusive, i wonder how much they get paid to allow the nosy tourists to peek around :-(( ). The scenery was beautiful, taking us through green rice fields (extra compliment here as most rice is harvested in October and most terraces sit grey by November) and small villages. The routes were far way from busy roads, there was no traffic apart from occasional encounters with other groups from Bali Budaya). Condition of the bikes was great, they are really maintained to the western standard. We were a bit wary of getting squeaky rusty cheap bikes but got very good robust well maintained bikes instead. Safety is well organized with an air conditioned car traveling behind all the way and another truck with spares and spare bikes and a maintenance team. There was also a support guide following behind the last cyclist in the group for safety and to ensure nobody gets behind. Our guide got a flat tire on route (he was using a personal hybrid i guess), we panicked but only for 2 seconds - as that's how long it took to get him a back up bike from the truck. Wow, that was impressive!And don't worry about the price - first, it's well worth it, second, it's a standard price for a tour in Bali (35-40 USD per head), third, if you think how many people are involved and the ridiculously low salaries in Bali, this is actually very small money to pay compared to what we leave for a dinner in an average restaurant in Bali. The booking was made with no prepayment or credit card info required. We spent our cash at the souvenir shop at the coffee plantation and paid by card on return to Ubud at BB's office. So easy and accommodating that we feel guilty for abusing the Balinese trust!On suggestions side, I'd take a bit heavier ride and heavier educational load on culture, religion etc - perhaps it would be good to introduce options with slightly different content/difficulty like medium cycling difficulty/light info content or the other way around or both. In fairness, we did have an option to cycle back uphill for 45 minutes for \"those who'd like\" but didn't dare in Bali's heat! I'm also a bit disturbed by the fact that guides never get to share lunch with the tourists -it's not just Bali Budaya, it's almost a rule every where in the developing world, but it would be nice to have the guides at the same table as tourists, eating the same food - they deserve it more than we do!There are a few other companies offering similar tours, but i wouldn't risk those as we got everything we could hope fore and more through Bali Budaya.We loved it, best experience after the Balinese art indulgence in Ubud :-) Thanks so much"

Obviously we got drinks at breakfast and lunch, but were only given 1 small bottle of water and a banana during the actual bike ride. From what I remember there is about 3-4 hours between breakfast and lunch, so I'd recommend taking your own water if it is a hot day. Be warned that although it isn't a strenuous journey as it is 95% downhill, you do go quite fast. Two younger children were in my group, and one of them ended up not cycling as it was too steep/ fast. It wasn't a problem as she got a lift down with in the van. You can also leave bags etc in the van.Near the end we broke in to two groups, one who wanted to do some more challenging, uphill cycling, and the other continued downhill. I was in the downhill which was great as we stopped in a village when our guide realised his friend was getting married there, so we got to drop in and meet the bride and groom. Although it was expensive (I'm travelling on a budget), I would recommend it and I'm glad I did it. Oh and the lunch afterwards was delicious."

It really isn't a difficult cycle so don't let that put you off, you're pretty much just gliding downhill most of the way. You've just got to watch for the dodgy brakes (which some of them had haha) but it's all part of the experience right?! If you want a great day out then Eco Cycle is a must!"

We were collected on time by our lovely guide Made and driver Ketut. There were around 12 guests on the tour in total and we certainly enjoyed their company. Nice breakfast at Mt Batur then a stop at e coffee and spice farm before collecting out bikes. Bikes were selected according the the size of the riders and helmets were provided. (Make sure you request the extra seat padding!) first stop was a visit to a traditional Balinese family (a little confronting if this is your first time in Bali) We also stopped in a rice field and watching some harvesting. After 23km we were offered the option of bus to a late lunch or for the more adventurous a more energetic 7km ride which includes uphill.nlunch was a great buffet of traditional dishes including rice, Nasi Goreng, mie Goreng, smoked duck, smoked chicken, bean salad, sambals and individual fruit plates. A great day out and amazing value for money at less than $40 Aus per person all inclusive. We would highly recommend the tour and the tour operators.special thanks to guide Made!"

First stop was Kintamani for breakfast and the view. And what a view it was. Absolutely spectacular looking out over the volcanoe and the lake. Breakfast was excellent especially the black rice pudding.Next stop was a coffee plantation which was interesting, you get to sample different types of coffees and teas and observe demonstrations of how the products are made. It took almost two hours to get to the bikes, which are mountain bikes with front and rear gears. The trek is almost entirely downhill (just two small hills) so you can coast the 26k's. Lots of stops along the way the most interesting at a traditional Balinese family compound. Once inside the compound you can go anywhere you please to find out how traditional Balinese people live. It was informative and interesting.We also had the opportunity to watch rice cultivation and production which was interesting as were the many sights and excited kids along our route. At the end of the tour you have lunch at the companies own restaurant. The food was very good.Best of all was our guide.....what a character. Full of information and tales. All in all this was my favourite experience in Bali."

I am 50 something and managed ok after not being on a bike for years. I have a reasonable level of fitness but still found that 25kms on a bike can put a bit of a strain on your derrierre so swappping from side to side and standing up on the pedals was common. The bikes were good and had gears(not really needed much) and brakes - needed all the time, we were supplied helmets and water.We started off at 8.30 with a pick up from our villa in Ubud to join our group to travel to Kintamani for breakfast...personally we had breakfasted earlier as we are early risers but I did have a taste of the black rice pudding that was nice and it is a shame I didnt wait as the food looked excellent at the restaraunt but..only Bali coffee..We then headed back down the mountain to a coffee plantation tour which was informative and nice and we had a tray of free drinks to try as well between about 3 of us. Our guide Kadek was informative, spoke English very well and kept us moving along as well, introducing us to the civit cat and its unusal habit with coffee beans..sorry didnt taste it so cant comment. This all took a while and there was an opportunity to shop at the coffee shop on our way out.We finally kept going down the mountain a bit further to our bikes. We were given safety instructions and our group of 8 headed off. We were mostly in our 40's and above with even a 70 odd thrown in so we were hoping for nothing too difficult and Kadek didnt disappoint.We pulled up after about 15 minutes to a cemetary where Kadek respectfully explained some of the local customs and fielded questions. We then rode about another 15 minutes to visit a family compound where we were given an extensive tour both inside and out with very good explanations of how the family and community function as a norm. We were probably there about 1/2 hour.We then set off further down and after conferring with us all to check we were up to it we headed off down the rice paddies...a bit scary but not too bad. The path is rather battered and skinny and gave me a few interesting moments but I got thru unscathed and the view up the paddies was spectacular. We then traversed a steep valley with only one of us game to ride at this stage but the walk was appreciated by my backside anyway.We stopped at a village compound for a toilet break and then on to a really big old banyan tree where we caloried up with a couple of bananas and some biscuits..I was hungry by then. We continued on mostly down with a couple of steep ups to keep us honest, a trip thru a ceremonial gathering and a finally exciting bridge crossing and it was all over.Kadek made sure that the group stayed together and anyone with problems had a vehicle right behind us to sort it out and a tail rider to alert us to traffic so I felt quite safe the whole day. The only hawking we had was when we finished the ride and got back into our mini bus for the trip to the restaraunt where we had one of the best meals that I enjoyed in Bali. It was lovely. Then a drop off to our villa for a warm down swim. A lovely day and well worth the effort."

We were taken to Kintamani where we had breakfast overlooking the active volcano Mt Batur. Breakfast was so-so but the views compensated completely - spectacular! From there we visited a Balinese family's compound and saw them going about the course of their day - in this family's case weaving bamboo mats, tending animals etc. I had been dying to see what lay behind the high walls of these compounds seen all over Bali and I got to see it! (The family is paid for curious tourists to gawk at them so they don't mind at all!) From there we visited a Luwak Coffee making business and had a tasting of various types of coffees, including the famous \"poo coffee\" if desired (I declined, but enjoyed ginseng coffee, my husband enjoyed his).Then onto our mountain bikes, given safety instructions and proceeded on a downhill ride for 23 kms, through villages (children calling \"hello\" all along the way, rice paddies and generally the country-side of Bali.At the end of the ride we were driven to a restaurant where we were treated to a really superb Balinese feast and then driven home - arriving around 4.30 pm ... all this for $36 AUD!!!Made was our tour guide and he was SO articulate and informative, never tiring of my constant questions about his culture.

The best memories I have of Bali was pedaling through such beautiful country side, the wind and a big smile on my face, unafraid that I got left behind cause this young hardworking boy followed behind me patiently and warned me of, \"Motorbike!\" This tour is definitely a must. Definitely encapsulates what makes Bali Bali."

            "review": "25 Km of downhill magic. We booked the tour ourselves on the recommendation of friends. The phone booking was easy. We are a family with three children 15, 12 and 8 (see end of review for comments).Our day started with the prompt collection from the hotel. One further pickup and the little bus was full and heading up into the highlands. The first stop was breakfast at the lakeview hotel Kintamani overlooking the active volcano and lake. Food was good and the view spectacular. Into the bus again to visit a small coffee plantation. It was very interesting to see the various styles of coffee available and especially the Luwak coffee (look that up if you dare!). The negative of this place was that we thought the prices in the expansive gift shop were a little steep.Then it was off to collect our bikes. There seemed like about 5-8 similar sized busses there and it was a bit of a scramble to find a bike and helmet to suit. After a brief instruction the seperate groups of around 10 people headed off and down the narrow country road. Each group was manageable with one guide at the front and an assistant at the rear. Support trucks were never far away in case of equipment failure or fatigue. It actually worked well as the groups were spaced far enough apart not to create a mob. The bikes were all well worn but seemed to function well enough and in good repair.First stop was a family compound. It was very interesting to see life in this part of the country and the various traditions and daily routine of the family there. There were several different compounds spread amongst the various bike groups so we or they (the families) were never crowded. It was also pleasing to hear that these people were apparantly benefiting from our visit as we were told that the bike company \"sponsored\" the families that were visited.Further stops on the downhill trek included the various stages in the growing and harvesting of rice, a carpentry workshop and a huge tree.Our group was the last to reach the end point where our little bus was waiting for us. There was an option to ride the last leg up to the resturant but we declined. The lunch was excellent with a selection of food and a great desert. It was back into the bus with our new friends for the quick trip back to Ubud.YOUNG CHILDREN. Our youngest daughter is 8 years old. We were a little apprehensive as to whether she would be up to the trip. The staff were fantastic and catered very well for her and made it enjoyable for her without impacting on the rest of our group. There were times as we followed close behind that I was anxious especially at some intersections and heavy traffic areas. There were plenty of opportunities for things to go wrong and a couple of scary moments. Overall it was a considered risk but the positive experience and outcome was worth it."

We booked direct via the internet and confirmed with a phone call (reasonable price at Rp379,000 each), and our car collected us on time from Seminyak, even finding our Villa which was down a very long & narrow driveway. We had an hour's drive before our first stop, to view some picture perfect rice terraces. We continued our journey to breakfast on top of Kintamarni Volcano, the restaurant sits on the rim of the Batur caldera and overlooks the 'volcano within a volcano'. It is possible to see the lava flow from the 1963 eruption. Breakfast was good, pancakes and fruit or the Indonesian alternative. We then headed to a coffee plantation to try the 'catpoochino' - coffee beans extracted from the poo of the Civet 'cat'. At first we thought this wouldn't be worthwhile but it was interesting and we got to taste a variety of coffees and teas as well as see caged Civet's. Next stop bike riding, our guide was very friendly and informative, took us down the hills via lovely villages, going into a local family's house and stopping at other interesting sites along the way. Riding beside the rice paddies is very relaxing, we had the opportunity to wander between the fields and see rice being harvested. The lunch at the end of the ride was brilliant - best food on any trip yet. Toilets nice and clean. The brochure said we would see the Ubud monkey forest but this wasn't included in our day. Highly recommend."

In the village we were taken into a home and allowed to look around and explore the grounds. From here on we were in the rice fields and they were beautiful. As green as anything I could have imagined. The footing can be quite treacherous, but our guide was awesome and even carried our 2 year old himself when the going got tough. After a nice healthy walk we were taken to a restaurant with a nice little buffet waiting. The back to our hotel before 2pm. All of this for only $40!"

We went with this tour on recommendation from our taxi driver (who also got us a 100k rupiah discount, so ask around) and on the whole we found it very enjoyable. The morning breakfast overlooking the Volcano was a great start and our guide was interesting and informative throughout. The equipment was generally in good condition but I'd definitely advise checking everything thoroughly! Some bikes had less than desirable tyre tread, some helmets were a poor fit etc so don't set off until you're comfortable.In terms of cycling it certainly wasn't taxing and I'm not sure we even peddled for the first 10k. Some of our group definitely struggled with the rough road sections and general village traffic however so confidence on a bike is the minimum requirement.As some others have mentioned rolling through real village life was far more enjoyable than some of the stops, particularly the coffee plantation which was basically a poorly guised tourist trap (come and see our overpriced shop and caged Civet). If it was more cycling and less tourist stops it would certainly be 5*"

The day started with breakfast overlooking Mount Batur and the nearby lake. Then we visited a spice garden, sampled locally grown tea (ginger, lemongrass), coffee and hot chocolate - all included in the tour price, though if you want to drink Luwak Catpoocino you'll need to pay a few dollars for a pot, but there's no obligation to do so. Then it was on down the hill to pick up our bikes - all in good condition. Bagus was careful to make sure we all knew which way round the front and back brakes were, then we put on our helmets and started pedalling, though not for long as we were soon headed downhill, through beautiful villages and past rice terraces.If you're looking for a strenuous day out - this isn't it, as most of the ride is downhill, testing those all important brakes. But if you do want something a little more challenging there's the option at the end of the trip to bike to the restaurant where lunch is served - about 8km and mostly uphill. Otherwise there's a vehicle to take you there - and to carry any stuff you don't want on your back while you're cycling.Plenty of water was offered, plus toilet and photo stops along the way. We visited a typical family compound, saw a massive sacred banyan tree and plenty of rice terraces - all with the sun on our skin and the wind in our hair. There were people of all ages and plenty of kids, plus bikes to suit.Lunch was good and much better than many of the tourist buffets you find on such excursions. The smoked duck was delicious! So, what are you waiting for..?"

Lunch was excellent quality and overall it was good value. Joe gave us a good running commentary during our time on the bus. Helmets were provided. The route was incredibly safe and scenic.Points for improvement - it was a little long in the saddle (but others that are very keen cyclists might not think so). The bikes are varying in their roadworthiness and the tyres on mine were very bald. There were plenty of bikes to choose from so I should have inspected the bikes more closely before we departed. But no mishaps so it was all good and the brakes were fine."

Our guide was wonderful and talked about his life and the way people live locally. We saw villages in a way that we wouldn't have by bus, and the variety of villages really stood out. The meal at the end was fabulous. When I managed to lose the chain from my brand new bike they were very nice to me and sorted it out on the spot. Neither of our kids are confident cyclists and I think they would have been a bit freaked out by the traffic. But for us it was fabulous.

We looked at out options and decided to do the Bali Eco/Educational-Cycling Tour with BEC. Of all tour companies, theirs came the most highly recommended - we quickly figured out why. We were picked up at our hotel in the morning and taken to join a bus of other tourists. Our guide Made told us what to expect for the day and about Balinese culture all the way to our breakfast destination - a wonderful restaurant overlooking Mr. Batur lake. After breakfast, we made a stop to taste Luwak Coffee, before picking up bikes and helmets(!). I felt very safe following Made along the local roads from stop to stop. We were encouraged to stop to take photos anywhere we wanted on route, and were offered bathroom stops along the way. The food was exceptional - breakfast and lunch. Water is plentiful and a snack is provided en-route. The cycling is downhill almost the whole way and everyone, including the kids in the group, appeared to find it was relaxing/enjoyable as we did. The entire day was well organized and very informative. Finally, I was very impressed with the Company's commitment to giving back to the community (e.g. by informing us at the outset to save our plastic bottles to give to the kids at the end of our ride for recycling - and so they could collect the refund). We highly recommend taking part in this tour!!!"

We loaded into the van and pickedp up a few other people and then got on the road for about a 90 minute ride to Mount Batur. When we get there, our guide gives us a briefing and hands out some flashlights as well as some water bottles. There is a little restaurant at the base where we waited for a bit. We bought some coffee and cookies to tide us over until we got to the top. Be warned that in August, it is quite chilly at the base (and top for that matter) of Mount Batur at 4am. Best suggestion for dressing is pants and a light jacket to start. On the way down, the sun really heats things up so if you can roll up your pants or wear the kind where you can zip part of them off to end up with shorts.The climb up is steady and steep. Wear some really confortable shoes (we had hiking shoes) and be ready to use your hands in certain spots. The climb is not too fast especially since it is in the dark with only flashglights to see where you are going. When you reach the shelters where the breakfast is served, there is still more climbimg if you want to do it. It is another 45 minutes to the very top over a very loose and rocky path. We did not go to the very top.The vistas from the lower summit (where we were) were amazing. You could see all of lake Batur and even the peaks of Lombok island in the distance. Then the sun rose and it was even better.Breakfast consisted of some banana sandwiches, hard boiled eggs, juice, fruit and some chocolate bars.The climb down was intially quite steep and on very loose material. Eventually, it became less steep and the ground became more stable.We were back at our resort in Sanur around lunch time."

As long as you can ride a bike, even a very basic level of fitness is more than enough, because this 20 km ride is nearly all downhill. The breakfast views of the volcano reveal that there is much more to Bali than Bintang and Batik. Visiting the coffee producers of Lewak coffee, the most expensive in the world, and seeing the creatures from whose waste products the coffee is produced is a real eye opener. Smelling cinnamon and vanilla, ginseng, tumeric and ginger all grown at source, was a treat for the senses. Made and Froggie, our guides, were helpful, entertaining and funny. Finishing with the Balinese lunch was a real treat. Highly recommended as the highlight of our trip."

Having booked this tour based on a friends rave review we were hoping it was as good as she said, and we were not disappointed, we had a fantastic day.I have been to Bali before and experienced a few of the places/sights we visited on the tour, but our guide Made (pronounced Mar day) was so interesting and knowledgable at all of the stops that I honestly felt like I was experiencing these places for the first time again (coffee stop and volcano view in particular).I am by no means a cyclist, the only bike I ride is one at the gym and it doesn't go anywhere! So needless to say I was a little apprehensive about riding around the hills of Bali, but to my delight at least 95% of the ride is a leisurely downhill ride (gentle slope) with little or no interruption from cars or bikes.The local village children delight in giving you high 5's and yelling out hello, where are you from? And have such joy on their faces when you respond.Lunch and breakfast were delicious!If you're thinking about doing this tour don't hesitate. It's a great way to get out of the more touristy beach side areas and experience a little of the authentic side of Bali.Thanks to Made, you're a terrific guide."

The two first tailormade tour days we spent in pleasent company of the owner Steve with snorkeling, bathing in hot springs, eating delicious dishes in restaurants, trekking through rainforrest in a crater, crossing a lake in canoes, watching dolphins from outrigger canoes at sunrise and visiting an ancient hindu temple. The third day we joined the downhill cykling tour through local villages with visit to a farm with a garden with all the famous fruits and spices from the far east. Our guide Darma gave us an amazing and highly engaged insight in Balinese culture which persists despite the impact of western influence. We only spent 3 days on Bali on our Indonesian tour, but felt we got a sincere and thorough impression of the every day Bali life as this has been for centuries with the huge influence of religious customs and ceremonies.Our guides had great concern for the environment, were fluently English speaking (beside Steven as Australian) and dedicated to provide us with impression of the \"original and real Bali\".We highly recommend Bali Cykling Tour and feel we made just the right decision by choosing them to organize a three day tour for us.Rasmus, Mads, Mette and Lars"

            "review": "'Just do it'. What an excellent way to spend a day in the middle of Bali... and all for $35.00. My partner and I were picked up from our hotel by the tour's wonderful (always smiling) host - Darma in a comfortable, air-conditioned minivan. We were driven north through local villages before arriving at our breakfast spot approximately 3000m high overlooking a volcano and lake below. A full Balinese buffet breakfast is provided with the first Kodak moment. Following this we were driven down to a spice plantation for an informative guided tour, which included tasting the locally produced coffees and teas. Shortly thereafter we are driven to our bicyle pickup point where you get to select your bike and helmet (all in good order). We cycle for the next 25km through local villages, rice paddy fields, etc. and even get to see inside a typical Balinese rural home and say hello to the owners. All this riding is downhill and at a very moderate rate, so you do not need any great level of fitness. At the end of the 25km we are presented with the option to get back on board the minivan or to ride the last 40 minutes with a number of uphill climbs. We opted for the ride and we agreed that this was perhaps the most enjoyable bit. The whole affair is capped off with a beautiful lunch, before you are driven back to your hotel door around 4pm. Just loved it. Highly recommended. Well done Darma."

We stopped at one village and were invited to visit a traditional family compound. It was so interesting to see how the locals live. We learned so much about their culture. We then went through the rice paddies and stopped to see the preparations for a cremation.The day ended with the most delicious buffet lunch (you must try the duck!!). They also provided free bottled water throughout the day and catered for vegetarians. This was a highlight of our Bali holiday.Thankyou"

            "review": "Reccomended- good food. In mid-July we completed Bali Eco's one-day downhill cycling tour. There were no difficulties with our hotel pick up (7.30am-8.00am from Ubud) or drop off (3pm ish), the mini bus was comfortable, the food provided on the tour was excellent and the bikes and helmets were in good repair. We paid 36,000 rupiah per person and the cycling part of the tour was genuinely downhill.The highlights of the tour were the information provided by our friendly and funny guide (his English was excellent), the views of Bali's Volcano at the breakfast stop and looking at the scenery whilst bike riding downhill.The lowlights of the tour related to animal welfare issues. The tour included seeing caged civit cats at the herb/coffee/tobacco farm where the cages could benefit from extra size, plants (or best of all the animals being released and not being included as part of the tour). The second animal welfare issues was visiting a local home/farm that raised and kept pigs kept in small pens without providing the pigs space or time for free roaming. Although the pigs probably had better living conditions than pigs in a factory farm it would be a positive step for eco-tourism to support, or at least work towards supporting, free range farming.Overall the tour doesn\u2019t get far from Bali\u2019s well worn tourist track and follows a similar (but enjoyable) formula to other one-day bike tours that we have completed in South East Asia (see a plantation, visit a home, see a local animal, do some farm work, ride, have lunch). I would recommend the tour to others visiting Ubud (particularly if you haven't completed a one-day bicycle tour in asia before) and I would use Bali Eco again."

Having found them on the Internet, I emailed them and the staff were always very quick and efficient in replying. I was picked up by the guide on time, driven with 11 others up to the volcano. On the way we stopped off at a coffee and tea plantation and got to sample delicious coffees and teas, which you could buy if you liked. Following this we soon arrived to breathtaking views of the volcano and lake. Breakfast was very tasty and plenty of it.Following this we were dropped off at the start of the ride, where we selected a bike, got saddled up with spongy cushion things and helmets, and then off we went. It was literally downhill most of the way; very easy! We stopped at a family compound, rice paddy field, a school and even found out about the ceremony preparations being made for an upcoming cremation. The scenery was amazing! Our guide was brilliant; very informative, good humored and very patient. You could ask him anything and he always explained it clearly.The ride finished and we had the choice to minivan it or cycle up hill the next 8km to our lunch destination. The lunch buffet was amazing and you are encouraged to go back for more! Overall, this tour is a must do and this company were great!Top tip: wear trainers!!!"

Great breakfast and lunch, but as we were the last group to arrive we had lunch at about 3 o'clock which is a bit late!

The ride, from Kintamani, back to Ubud, was thoroughly engaging all, the way. There was nothing related to local culture and customs that our guide, Darma, couldn't address. Much of his knowledge was based on personal experience which meant it had relevance.

If you are tourist in Bali and know basics of cycling I.e paddling and maneovore the steering handle, do not do not do not miss this opportunity to see country side Bali. It is worth the experience and surely you will not regret. Day starts with hotel pickup between 7 and 8 am, followed by a lovely drive to kintanmani. Delicious breakfast and more importantly the brilliant views of mt batur,an active volcano. Black rice is not worth missing. Freshen up and go off to spice garden, coffee garden etc. taste 6 types of tea and coffee, see the kuwait brand of coffee, sight the kulaks (cat like animal which feeds on coffee beans), checkout the various spices including the Bali chilly. Now get ready to saddle up and it on your safety helmets and ride in a straight formation. Couple of retnstops included in this approx 30 kms ride which has mostly downhill with some interesting uphill too!! First stop is a balinese house experience followed by a ride thru rice fields, capture some Kodak moments, catch some breath under the shade of a 500 years old banyan tree including gobbling some bananas. More drinking water is provided. The rice field experience is worth the entire ride! After crossing a bridge over a river it is decision making time - go downhill for 5 minutes to a waiting bus which Drives you till the lunch venue or ride 8 more kms, mostly uphill (phew!!!) to the venue where cold towels give you the required relief, followed by a delicious lunch. If you are vegetarians like me, your request will be met. Once done fill up the feedback form and get in the vehicle which drops you back at your hotel or ubud market area. The amount of IDR 360,000 is surely worth the entire experience. The guides are brilliant and ever ready to give you that extra push where required!!! Also excellent experience of meeting many like minded humans and spending some fruitful time understanding the Balinese culture together and also sharing views with each other. Taking group snaps is lovely souvenior to remember in future. Just plunge and you will not regret........thank you Bali Eco tour for making day in Bali wonderful........"

On our recent trip to Bali we were recommended by friends to do the cycle tour from Kintamani (mt batur) down to Ubud. We were not disappointed.We were picked up at our villa at 7am (bit early but need 1hr to get up to Ubud). Then continue on to top of Mt Batur and have breakfast at restaurant around the rim of the crater. Magnificent vista with the lake below - absolutely stunning. We then went to coffee plantation and got to sample numerous coffees and teas as well as the worl famous lowak coffee - very smooth.Then it was off to get kitted up with our bikes and helmets. We were all given water to take on our bikes so no need to bring your own.The ride was amazing. First stop was in a traditional Balinese compound where we got to see them weaving mats and splitting the bamboo as well as get up close with a few pigs. Our guide Made had excellent English and brought a lot of humor to his narration - he also shared some of his family stories to give us a better appreciation of Balinese culture.Then it was off downhill through the rice fields and I mean literally through the rice fields - at one point you ride on a paved path weaving through the rice fields.We had an energy stop at a 500 year old banyan tree where we got bananas and crackers as well as more water if needed, then we were off on our bikes again.The trip ended near an aqueduct but because the village was preparing for a funeral ceremony the support cars couldnt get through to meet us so we rode through the village and got to see the ceremony preparations.Once we met the support vehicles, it was off to lunch at Ubud. If you weren't saddle sore and feeling like Cadel Evans, there was an option to ride up to Ubud (about 40 mins). Lunch was superb and very tranquil after 2-3hrs on the bike.The ride was mostly downhill on fairly good roads. Where there is a hill you get to go downhill first to pick up your speed before the uphill. We are a family with 3 kids (ages 10, 14& 16) and all really enjoyed the day. It exposed our kids to the daily of the traditional Balinese and was a fun and active way of doing it.We were back at our villa in seminyak around 4pm so a full day but well worth it.I thoroughly recommend anyone do this trip."

I recently did 2 tours with these guys after reading glowing reviews on tripadvisor \u2013 the East Coast snorkeling trip and Mount Batur sunrise climb. From start to finish the staff was extremely helpful and efficient in responding to my questions, requests via email. Taking payment only on the day off was also very convenient for someone who didn\u2019t want to put up a deposit via credit card ahead of time. On my first tour \u2013 the Day snorkeling trip, the hotel pickup was right on time and the tour guide (I\u2019m sorry I forgot his name!) was very friendly and informative - about notable landmarks we passed by or just my random questions regarding Balinese customs. After experiencing some strong waves at our first snorkeling site to see the wreck Liberty, they immediately took us to a more serene spot where the snorkeling was amazing, which was then followed by an extremely delicious seafood restaurant by the sea at Perosi beach. My group was a party of 6 and the tour guides were quite flexible in catering to what we wanted to do \u2013 i.e. spend more time at Perosi beach, which is beautiful white sand with fun waves to break, and skip the tourist traps like the water palace. On my second tour \u2013 the Mount Batur sunrise climb, again the hotel pick up was right on time and as our group had climbers with different fitness level, the Eco Bali guides and the local mountain guides split up to make sure everyone got enough attention. The 2am start, and 2-hour ascension in darkness upwards rough rock formations made the climb somewhat technically challenging, and my only comment is that some of the local guides were not so fluent in English, which made communication not so easy at times. But the Eco Bali guys were great, and made sure that people got up to different levels of the mountain that they were comfortable with. And lucky for us we witnessed a brilliant sunset and breathtaking view of the lake and down below right before heavy fog set in! I had originally opted to do the most popular bicycle ride tour on my 2nd day, but after the Mount Batur climb I was too tired! But I would highly recommend using these guys to organize your days, especially if you are crunched on time and want to maximize your Bali experience!"

It is your chance to really experience Bali first-hand (not from the back seat of a van or jammed in with a 100 other tourists at one of the popular destinations).

Our guide's English was impressive, and he was engaging and charming. We felt safe the whole tour thanks to him and the other 2 \"helper\" guides, even though it was raining for part of the day. We left feeling smarter and more connected with the people of Bali, as well as a little tired. (We did the optional up-hill part at the end - beware, it is nothing like the rest of the tour, so be ready for a little work-out if you do that part)."

Nice breakfast+lunch, very calm roads, high safety standards and soooo many interesting things to see. If you don't do it, you will miss a great insight into Bali.The second tour we did with Bali Budaya Tours was \"custom made\". We were impressed by the good organisation of the cycling tour and decided to go with them on a tour around the island.Up to the North and then along the eastern coastline until Padang Bai. We booked one driver and one guide (which was the owner himself, very cool guy) including car, petrol, food, housing, donations and snorkeling gear. Those were three really great days. We got a lot of insights into the balinese culture, saw many beautiful places and tried several fruits and dishes we wouldn't have tried on our own. Those days are a great memory for us as we enjoyed every single minute of it!"

Started strangely when picked up by the bus and was greeted with \"Can I see your ticket?...That was a very low price, please don't discuss what you paid with others!\". That left a sour taste in my mouth but I was happy with the insight into the culture and traditions of Bali. Had some great meals, coffee and tea tasting was good (I still don't see what the fuss is about Lewak Coffee) and the cycling relaxing. The visit to the local home was insightful. I didn't pedal for the first 45 min so was glad we had the option of an extra 8km uphill at the end to work up a real sweat."

Our guide Weda (Wayda) was brilliant! full of information who loves and knows his country very well!Pick up is available from all the major locations. but would reccomend doing this if you are staying in Kuta area or Ubud.. as the drive from Nusa Dua is at least 2 hours. Breakfast over looking the volcano! then off to the coffee plantation where you do learn alot about local produce.Then off to the start line. Im a tall bloke and had not problems finding a larger bike. Recommend checking all brakes and gears before you head off as they will be used! if you have any issue they will fix no problem, and there is a mechanic with your group at all times for any issues along the way.The tour is all down hill, and you rarely need to pedal! and you hardley run into any traffic, you finish with an option of an 8km uphill ride to the restaurant for lunch or you can just hop on the bus. I did the 8km ride and it is not to difficult at all if you are resonable fit, on mountain bike is fine with the low gearing."

We were picked up right on time from our bungalow in Ubud and driven with 12 or so others up to Mount Batur in Kintamani to begin our tour with breakfast on the restaurant terrace overlooking the volcano and Lake Batur. After breakfast, we stopped at a Balinese organic plantation, where we were shown the uses of many local plants and traditional herbal remedies, and the process of making coffee. Among the crops are cloves, garlic, chili, cocoa, vanilla, tapioca, taro, jack fruit, cinnamon, and persimmon. This plantation specialises in civet cat (called Luwak here) coffee \u2013 \u201ccatpooccino\u201d \u2013 in which the coffee beans are extracted from the animal\u2019s poop, a delicacy which sells for $80 a cup in New York and is $6 here at the plantation (so, naturally, I had to have a cup \u2013 very smooth and strong!).After that caffeine overdose, we picked up our mountain bikes nearby and zoomed off down the rural road to our next stop, a family compound in a local village which houses 25 related people. It was fascinating to walk through the local home and see daily village life, including three kitchens, a weaving area, gardens, livestock, including two tiny pigs, and be given insight into Balinese culture and customs. After the compound visit, riding down the road once again we wove our way through throngs of village kids coming home from school and through typical village traffic: bikes, cars, trucks, motorbikes, dogs, chickens, chicks, pedestrians and school kids high-fiving. Once through the village we made our way down a very thin winding down and uphill cement path, and then into and through the rice fields, where we stopped for a walk through the terraces and watch villagers harvesting rice.Our final stop was an enormous five hundred year old Banyan tree, after which we rode along very bad pavement \u2013 rutted, pot holes \u2013 and forded a river to complete the twenty-five km downhill portion of the ride, before embarking on the optional ten km up-hill ride to a restaurant, described as for the \u201cmore athletic guests\u201d. Unfortunately, it began to pour, but the cold beer and Indonesian feast waiting for us at the restaurant almost made up for it \u2013 smoked duck and chicken, chicken satay, tofu in peanut sauce, and gado-gado, a vegetarian dish, to complete a fantastic ride which is highly recommended.

Arrived to breathtaking views, had a great breaky, met the rest of our tour, only 8 people in total, went to a nearby coffee and spice plantation where we learnt a lot about the produce, tasted some great coffees and teas, then set off on our mountain bikes for the day. Cycling through rural villages, rice paddies, visiting a local home, the majority of the ride was easy and allowed you to take in the beautiful surrounding country side, with little village kids running along side you shouting 'hello hello', just a great relaxed day. The last leg of the ride was optional, about half an hour up hill, gradual incline, but not for the unfit. If you give it a go and its too much, they have the car following us, so you can flag that you are out and they'll put your bike in the back and you jump on in the car. We ended the day at a restaurant in a chilled out part of outer Ubud where we got to sample some local delicacies. All in all, a great day out, learning a lot about the Balinese culture, our guide was both highly knowledgeable and professional, with a great sense of humour. All this for about $37 AUS each, plus $20 for the 4 hr return transfer made for a great day with amazing value for money!"

He was also excellent with the kids and patched up a grazed knee after a minor spill (one of the adults) - he is a true all-rounder. We were a group of seven, 4 adults, 10 & 13 year olds and a small six year old in a seat on the back of her dad's bike. This set up worked perfectly, the staff were very attentive and careful to make sure we were all comfortable.Make sure you go with this company as there are many copycat operations and they are not as professional or safe as the original. Take note of the two different names, the address and phone number as there are many dodgy brochures which appropriate a lot of this company's message."

You get picked up from your hotel and driven up Mount Batur for a great breakfast, after which you bike down the mountain back to Ubud. To be honest, there's not much biking as it's all downhill, you spend more time braking than pedaling, so it's pretty easy to do for most people. Along the way you stop at different places to be shown things such as a typical Balinese family compound, perhaps some rice harvesting, maybe someone practicing the gamellan. It's all very well done and you do get to see things you usually wouldn't, so this is well worth doing and in fact, our friends said everyone who first visits Bali should really do this trip in the first couple of days of arriving. The trip includes that lovely breakfast and also a fantastic lunch at their own cafe, and finishes off at Monkey Forest in Ubud."

We had breaky while checking out beautiful Mt. Batur. The bike route was beautiful. We did so much in the tour including biking thru the rice fields, tasting the infamous luwak coffee and visiting a true Balinese village/compound. It is a pretty leisure ride and is good for a beginner or advanced rider - they give you an additional option of riding uphill for an additional 30-45 min. I did this option and loved the workout! We then ended up treating ourselves to an amazingly delish Balinese buffet overlooking beautiful rice gardens. Putu was our tour guide and he rocked - super informative & kind - a great representative of the beautiful Balinese people and the Bali Eco Cycling company. Enjoy the ride - it is awesome!"

My Girlfriend and I booked one of these tours after some negotiation on price (got about $20 off asking price) and we were happy with the day. There are a couple of companies that offer this tour and I\u2019m sure most offer the same thing, not sure which company we used. We opted to be picked up from Seminyak and they driver was happy to drop us off at the end of the day in Sanur at our next hotel which is always a nice easy way to get a \u201cfree ride\u201d.When the driver picked us up we headed off for a good 45 minutes of driving up the big Volcano. We stopped at a roadside area which lead into a beautiful tropical garden with all sorts of fruits and they had a couple of those Civit\u2019s that eat and poop out coffee beans. Apparently people pay good money for that so we tried one and it tasted like...... coffee !! Anyway, at least now I can say I\u2019ve tried it. At the volcano we stopped to take some pics and ate some banana fritters then it was onto the bikes for a solid 35+KM of downhill riding. There were only 5 of us in the group (+ guide) and at no stage did I feel in danger of the passing vehicles or anything like that. The driver follows the group the whole way and gets other vehicles to slow as they pass and every driver was very courteous. This downhill trek was pretty easy and can be done by anyone who has any basic fitness and can ride a bike. The bikes were in good nick and easy to use. This tour allows you to see a side of bali not many probably would. The local people are all friendly and wave and smile as you cruise by. Its not a mass produced tour either so nothing felt fake about it all. I would certainly recommend this tour to anybody who has a day in Bali that is looking for a really nice way to spend it instead of being on the beach drinking crappy beers and being hassled for stuff ! :-)"

At first i thought the tour was a bit expensive but signed up anyway as it was highly recomended, but afterwards i think it was a good deal. this tour is about seeing and experiencing bali in a fun and ntimate manner, not about getting a workout! - which is perfect for holiday. the tour starts with a drive up to a volcano with a lake and village in it and breakfast at the nice restarant over looking the view. breakfast served is just ok, but the black rice pudding is great! then you go to a place where they make the luwak coffee and you get to try many coffees and strange fruits and see some of them growing. then you start biking downhill and stop frequently to take photos and see villages and how people live and make crafts, fice fields, giant banyan tree, and lots more. there is just one or two very short uphill sections. lunch at the end at their own restaurant is great! one of te best meals we had in ubud. then they drive you back to your hotel. the guide informed us that our tour also includes a visit to monkey forrest for free if we want, but we didnt go since we had alady seen it the day before and its not really worth seeing anyway unless staring at a bunch of human dependant sad monkeys who try to jump on you is something that interests you. great tour! even the our guide, joe was great and speaks good english. even his snooty old english woman accent is entertaining!"

It was a very easy ride for all & at the end of it I was given the chance to do some uphill stuff which I jumped at. This was also very easy (as I do a lot of hill climbing) but well worth it. What was so good about the day, other than the riding, was that during the trip you get to see the real Bali and it's people. The villages we visited were amazing & to see the workings and lifesyle of a small family group was a real eye opener. We have been to Bali 7 times & have never witnessed some of the sights we saw on this ride. Our friends had been to Bali about 20 times & also had never seen some of this. Our guides, Dama and Froggie, so good with their knowledge and humour. If you haven't riden a bike in a long time don't be put off as it is very easy, the worst you might get is a sore butt for a day afterwards. The ride itself is only about 25k or 33 if you do the bit extra uphill stuff. The bikes provided were all good, hemet's were good, breakfast was the usual for Bali, with plenty of water throughout the day if needed. Even the banana's that were provided were some of the best I have eaten. Lunch at the end of the ride was amazing, some of the best food we have had in Bali. In all a hassle free day, exercise, entertaiment, educational & fun. Bali is a safe place to ride a bike & I did plenty of it whilst I was there."

Our boys are 8 and 10 years old, but very good bikers, so we wanted to do more off road biking through rice paddies. The company was very accommodating and arranged an extra guide, so we were able to skip the coffee making farm (have seen it a day before) and do more cycling. We only saw one other group during our entire 3 hour trip. We biked about 25 km down-hill and about 12 km gentle uphill. We saw some really picturesque rice fields, were shown a local home, cool banyan trees and learned a lot about local culture. The trip was finished at a local restaurant. We thought that food was really tasty for a buffet style. I pre-ordered vegetarian lunch and it was also very good. Cool Bintang (local beer) tasted really awesome after this trip.

Pros: Countryside is beautiful, look inside family compound is interesting, guide was informative.Cons:1) Safety/Equipment: The bikes and the helmets are shameful and at every point it is evident that safety is an afterthought. Multiple people in our group commented on this fact and many said they felt uncomfortable. Even though it was heavily raining at times and the roads were slick, the guides wanted to push through as they are on a schedule. While they take you on roads with \"less\" traffic, that is a relative term in Bali and you never can really relax. You would actually see much more in a car with a driver/guide and be much safer doing so.2) Food: Compared to most roadside shacks, it is probably on par. But far below what you can get for $10/each at a respectable Bali eatery. Like my review of the rafting, we were wishing at the end that we had just taken a taxi back to our hotel or another restaurant at the end of the activity instead of sticking around for the lunch.3) Coffee Farm: What a joke and the coffee was horrible. How does this really have anything to do with the average Balinese people?4) Family compound: The compound we looked at was set up in the traditional fashion. But there were a number of things that seemed curious to me. First, people were home during the day just kind-of lounging around or doing menial chores -- no work? Throughout the compound there were hardly any plants, no food, no clothes, no pets, or the other sort of items laying around that I have seen in other Balinese compounds. In fact, compared to others that we have seen and walked through, this was the most barren and poor-looking. Why? Something was odd about it.At the end of the day, I did learn some about Bali traditional culture and customs that seems to be going away quickly. One must decide however, if the safety risk you take is worth the learning you do on this tour and how genuine the experience really is."

The tourist information in Ubud recommended Bali Eco Cycling for cycling around Ubud and while most companies seem to offer pretty much the same thing, we chose Bali Eco.Pick up was exactly on time but because we had to pick up people in a quite remote resort it took some time to get to the breakfast. While they advertise that the lunch is not a cheap buffet (and it isn't), this breakfast really is a not so fantastic buffet but the view of the vulcanoes is fantastic. At the breakfast spot you'll find out that there's not just one Bali Eco group but that there are dozens. After breakfast they all go to a place where different kinds of fruits grow and where you can taste different coffees and teas, all included in the tour so free but the shop is quite expensive. After this, the cycling finally starts and like they promised it's all downhill. The ride is nice, bikes ok and helmets provided, the guide gives you lots of very interesting information and a lot of stops are made at interesting spots.Really worthwhile!The lunchbuffet is the end of the trip, where someone of the company came to every table to ask about our experience with Bali Eco. A good thing, but I didn't really appreciate them trying to make us put a positive review on tripadvisor or facebook. Another downpoint was the payment; when we booked we were told we could pay by cash or creditcard but it turned out that paying by creditcard costed an extra 3%. Seems to be an Ubud-thing, we experienced this in our hotel in Ubud as well but at no single other place in Bali."

            "review": "Bike Tour is a fantastic way to see Bali!. My husband and I are generally not \"tour\" people; we tend to travel at a faster pace and find that most tours trend slower (and more 'touristy') than we prefer. We are both SO glad we made an exception and booked with Bali Eco Cycling.Yes, the first part of the day was touristy- push through, it's totally worth the bike ride. Before we could hop on our bikes, we tasted lewak coffee at a coffee & spice farm, then drove for breakfast buffet (juices cost extra, plenty of vegetarian options) over Kintamani Volcano. Everything was very well organized, and our guide Ring was fantastic (fluent English, lots of information during the drive), but this tour is really about the biking.It was almost all downhill, and we really flew! If you're at all amenable to it, take a helmet... the roads are a bit bumpy, and there's a fair amount of maneuvering around potholes. We made several stops (to tour a family home, try our hand in the rice paddies, stop & play with local schoolkids, and talk with rice farmers), all of which were amazing. The last, optional part on your way to lunch is uphill, and in the heat & humidity, it's a serious workout. You always have the option to ride in the van during this segment, so don't let this deter you. Like another reviewer noted, I really felt like we were able to see the 'real Bali.' Cycling through the rice paddies with the sun on my shoulders has remained one of my all-time favorite travel experiences."

Down hill for almost the whole ride, our youngest being 10 handled it easily! The information learnt along the way was invaluable and very interesting...we were very fortunate to have Darma as our guide and what a remarkable man to meet. Darma made our day even more special.

I don't own a bike, so usually only ride on holidays so was a little worried that my inexperience would be an issue but it really was an easy ride. No issues at all. And the scenery was spectacular. Felt very \"eat, pray, love\" riding a bike through the rice paddies of Ubud. It was such a revelation to see how the Balinese people live, and we even got to stop at our guides compound and meet his family. The 22km down hill was easy, the optional 8 Kms uphill at the end in 36 degree heat is not for the faint hearted. I made it about 3kms before the heat got the better of me. Only do this bit if you consider yourself more than moderately fit. Or if it's a rare cool day. Breakfast overlooking Mt Batur was another highlight. Truly beautiful."

We were picked up at our hotel, had a delicious Balinese breakfast while viewing Mt Batur and then headed to our bikes stopping at a coffee plantation on the way. Riding down quiet back roads, being greeted by happy villagers and school children wanting hi 5s, visiting a family compound and being offered the opportunity to plant rice in a paddy all made this trip memorable. The best meal we had in Bali should have completed an interesting, culture filled day which was as good this year as last. A surprise trip to the Monkey Forest as we travelled through Ubud made the day even better."

            "review": "An immersive experience in the \"real Bali\". This cycling tour is quite unique as it's a 'downhill' ride, of 22km from the highlands back to near Ubud. It's actually a cultural tour, but instead of being in a typical air-conditioned car or coach, you're on a bicycle, with wind in your hair and being very much a part of the landscape instead of seeing it from inside a vehicle.The backroads are mostly traffic free, and there are guides both front & rear of the group. The downhill terrain means almost anyone who can ride a bike can participate, as long as you know how to brake! There's actually very little real cycling, because of the continuous downhill. I found it to be a very good way to see the Bali that most tourists never get to see - village life, the quiet backroads, walking in padi fields, lush forests. The scenery is fabulous, and the tour is very good value considering that it includes breakfast with a view of Gng Batur, a fabulous Balinese buffet lunch at a private restaurant, and even an optional visit to the Monkey Forest in Ubud. There's an optional 8km 'uphill' cycling at the end of the ride, and that's lots of fun, because you actually get to do some real cycling.The bikes are mountain bikes - adequate but not fabulous, and helmets are provided. The guides are great, they explain local customs and traditions, and make sure you're OK on the road. Thank you, Bali Eco, for a wonderful experience. I'd certainly recommend it to anyone for a tour with a difference!"

We were collected from our villa at 7.30 am and were driven with a group of about ten straight up to mt batur. After a 45 min drive we reached the mountain with breathtaking views and a fantastic traditional Balinese breakfast!!! We then started the descent on bikes and had stops along the way to villages and to see coffe plantations among some of the stops. The riding was not hard as it's all down hill and towards the end you had the option of riding some steep hills or driving behind in a car.we then ended with another wonderful Balinese lunch! Soooooo much fun but also our guide was so informative, making it all round a fantastic, worthwhile day, highly recommended!"

From breakfast overlooking the Mt Batur volcano, to sampling the Luwak 'cat poo' coffee (actually very very nice!), on to the bike ride through villages and rice fields, and finally a delicious banquet - the whole experience was wonderful. The ride itself is almost all downhill - your arms will do more work holding the brakes than your legs will pedalling. Guides are very professional and knowledgeable, and I learnt more about Balinese culture and family life in this one tour than I did on the rest of our holiday. Try the uphill section at the end if you're feeling reasonably fit, although I had to work hard to keep up with my young guide who was riding hands free and in thongs! (He would have slowed down if I asked - but it was a good challenge)."

We got to see village life, got to play with huge spiders and have a wander through the rice paddies. 'Cycling' is a loose term.

Booked directly through the website, and was great value at only 360k (approx. $40 US/AU) for a whole day trip, including pickup and drop-off, and 2 meals. Thoroughly interesting and personal, the staff was always professional and helpful. Our guide was Darma and he shared a lot of his own life and experiences and explanations which made it so much more interesting. You will get to see and hear about real Balinese daily life, very insightful.I also liked the fact that you could email and book the tour, Kara at the office was very prompt and helpful too.Cycling - this tour does not require a high level of bike fitness (unless you choose the uphill route) - I counted maybe 3 times when i had to actually use the pedals to go up a slope. All the rest was downhill, so more of a workout of your hands on the handbrakes. Only requirement is being able to balance on a bike (and being able to look around as you coast down the hill). Our tour was nearly all on tar-sealed roads (except for the last 500m which was slightly potholey) so you do have to be aware of other traffic on the road (although the guide at the back will warn you of overtaking traffic). We had 5 people in our group.Food - breakfast was pretty good, but lunch was extremely good, very tasty and plenty of it.What to bring - I would recommend a long sleeved light shirt or scarf to cover shoulders and back while riding as it does get hot (even if it's cloudy, you will feel the sun). Also bring sunscreen and insect repellent (I only got bitten twice while in Bali - both times on this tour!). Water and fruit refreshment is provided. Check the website for a full list of things to bring. If you have extra stuff you can leave it in the van following (which is secured at all stops).A suggestion for improvement (which I forgot to put on feedback form):- better explanation on how the gears work on bikes - for those who've never ridden a geared bike before (like me) - the explanation I got was 'it's in the middle so it's ok for you). I didn't quite understand how to change the gears to do the couple of uphill bits.Really enjoyed the day, would definitely recommend for all ages. Bali Eco Cycling are apparently the original cycling tour people, and there are many copy tours, so beware when you are looking around."

We stopped at many wonderful areas along the way where we were told of local Hindu customs and ways of life. It finished with a fantastic Balinese lunch.

After some consideration of the over 20 cycling companies in Bali, we decided on Bali Eco Cycling Tours from the information provided in the brochure at our little hideaway B and B in Ubud.The mini van was punctual for our morning pickup and Weda, our guide was a wonderful guide from the moment we met him. He was friendly, informative, safety-conscious and had a good sense of humour. The group was a congenial mix of 12 singles and couples from NZ, OZ, Holland, Brazil, Denmark and Canada. There were several vans full of day cyclists on this tour, each with their own guide.After after about a 90 minute ride up to the mountain area, we stopped for a self serve breakfast at a restaurant with a fabulous view... sorry don't remember details. The black rice pudding with the coconut cream was the best I'd tasted in Bali. Since I'd already had a copious breakfast, I passed up the chocolate and banana crepes, but helped myself to a bit of fruit (watermelon, pineapple, melon and salak) and good real coffee.The equipment was good and the staff were helpful with adjusting the seats... I even got a soft seat cover-terimah kasih! Water was provided any time. Nice cold face cloth was a nice touch at the end of the ride.It was pleasantly downhill most of the way with a detour from the fairly traffic light back roads through rice paddies and along a small river. There were some what I would consider dangerous areas, but Weda always cautioned well in advance and some of us just got off the bikes and walked. No pressure to perform at \"tour de France\" levels-good thing because there were 70 year olds besides me (55 year old) as well as some younger folk and we all enjoyed it at our own pace.The copious, self serve, delicious lunch of typical Balinese food including smoked duck and chicken, sate, tofu and tempeh was a highlight. Enuk sekali! Yummy!Oh... and the price? $360,000 rp which is less than 40 usd all inclusive. Good value for the money. We were all very satisfied with another wonderful day in Bali Bliss."

The cycling is very easy, probably 99% downhill for just a bit more than 20km. There is an optional uphill more advanced part, which is fantastic. You cycle right through the heart of some small villages in Bali and get to see some incredible sites. If you reading this, I know you don't me, but just trust me. This is a must do."

With the exception of a bit of a delay due to touristy activities (coffee plantation, family compound, etc.), the ride was wonderful and the scenery was spectacular. The guide provided very interesting information on the drive up to start the ride. Breakfast and lunch were both tasty, worthwhile, lots of choices, etc. The ride was relatively easy (the first 20 KM) at a relaxed pace.... and plenty of support. There is an option for an additional 8 km which we took (mostly uphill), but again - spectacular scenery and worth all of the effort and the price of the tour!"

Great guides, a chance to see behind the tourist veneer, with a great breakfast and fantastic lunch. Pickups and dropoffs from where you are staying in Ubud, plus thoroughly intersting co-riders. Rupiah 360k for an 8am till 3 pm event (the bike ride is only an hour or so - all downhill). This is a a 10/10 experience!"

Our group was small; 10 tourists of various fitness levels and riding experience and expectation, plus two guides and a back-up van and driver. We rode through rice paddies, golden and green, either being actively harvested or just dormant; we were humbled to visit with a family going about their everyday activities within their modest compound - women dexterously weaving mats, cooking or tending animals while we moved about like tentative aliens unsure of the intrusiveness or otherwise of our actions. Further along our down-hill journey, we came upon a not-so-common private cremation ceremony complete with a Balinese orchestra which was beautifully festive and formal. For those of us wanting more of a physical challenge, the homeward leg comprised of a 45 minute up-hill ride, but the smarter ones chose to continue downward to the awaiting feast in cooling shade. Joe, our lead guide with the smile like a split watermelon, imparted knowledge and great insight into his native land and culture. He's an absolute asset to the company; gentle and smart and wickedly funny and without him the day would have been merely good instead of nuanced and great. I'd recommend this all tour in a heartbeat."

Our guide spoke very good English (actually Jo had been taught to speak English by a North Londoner; consequently he spoke with a Liverpool accent, very funny!). Jo, our guide was really on the ball. He suspected there was something wrong with our van and had already rung and advised the office so when our van did die (only 200m from breakfast) we had a new bus waiting for us when we finished breakfast. As a coffee drinker I loved the trip to the Luwak coffee plantation and the sampling of different coffee. The Luwak coffee beans to buy were horribly expensive but at least I knew I was getting the real deal. Biking downhill for 25km was easy as and we had lots of stops along the way. The rice fields were picture perfect and everyone friendly along the way. It rained for the last 1/3 and raincoats were provided. Lunch at the end was very tasty in a beautiful pavilion. Highly recommended. ****One word of warning, we were rung by Eco cycling telling a pick up time but them rung later by our tourist centre to tell us another time (later). Unfortualetly Eco cycling turned up at the earlier time and we had to keep them waiting as we were not ready and thus all their other pickups were late. If someone other than Eco cycling changes the time check back with Eco just to be sure ."

Well equipped with rain coats provided for all the family. Baby and children bicycle seats and helmets available. On a bad note, one of our baby seat was broken and we had to tie a knot for the belt to secure our 2,5 years old daughter. Amazingly helpful staff though that love children. We ride close to ricefields, temples, villages and got to visit a family house with farm animal. The cylcing company offers a local lunch at the end, which was probably our best and most authentic lunch of the whole stay. A big hit with children and beautiful for the adults."

The breakfast view was spectacular; the food less so. They had run out of coffee... We enjoyed the informative stops before the cycling, but it was after noon before we finally got on the bikes. Many of the bikes needed a good lubricating. Mine seemed to be especially squeaky and had an underinflated back tire. But the gears and brakes worked. The ride itself was marvelous and very easy going apart from a few short rough bits which were easy to walk. The lunch food and location were really marvellous, and though we didn't eat until after 3, that was ok because snacks and drinks had been provided along the way."

In Ubud we came by the palast where a funeral was prepared. Tremendous work that was done by locals. Our guide took the chance to stop, and told us all about the ceremony that was going to be celebrated in the evening. On our way to Mount Batur we stopped at a famous rice field to enjoy the view and take some photos. Than we headed straight to our breakfast on the volcano. The view was no view. 300 meters before we reached our goal we were befogged. However, the breakfast was great. And the big posters showed what the view could have been. After the really nice breakfast buffet we visited a plantage where all sorts of trees, herbs, and coffees were planted. They even had the Luwak Coffee (as well as Luwaks). And than, finally, we drove the bike. Through rice fields where we talked to the workers who were harvesting the rice. Quite impressive. Eating rice now is a different experience to me. We also visited a family compound. This gave me a good idea of how most of the families in Bali still live. I got insights that no guidebook could share. The bycicle ride itself also was great. Since it's downhill (well, not downhill but down the road) all the time, it's easy going. And you can concentrate on all the impressions you get from the environment. For the lunch I could choose to jump on the car again, or to ride the bike a little bit uphill. I chose the second option. And was grateful for the cold towel that was handed to me when we finally reached the goal. We had lunch before we went back to Ubud. Wow !! Great guides, great staff, great experience."

Our guide was fantastic, a very knowledgeable man with a interesting life tale. Our day started with breakfast at the Crater Lake. It was surprisingly cold when we arrived but had warmed up by the time we left.Next stop the coffee plantation which was interesting and gave a caffeine boost for the ride ahead.We had a great diverse group from Canada, Australia, Sweden and America. We also had a variety of ages from 18-retired and the cycling suited everyone. The bikes are in good condition but I am glad I took my gel seat cover.The ride is easy, mostly down hill and you stop quit frequently and more if you want to. They will stop anytime for you to take photos. You have an option to do a few small hill climbs or continue down hill, our group took the small hill option. Everyone coped with it just fine; the hills apart from one are small.The information and sites you see on this tour are wonderful. This was my 4th visit to Bali and I learnt more about Bali on this tour than in all my previous visits.The lunch is as advertised one of the best meals you will have in Bali and there is lots of it.A truly amazing day, I have done motorcycling in Vietnam around Hue and Hoi An and this was just as wonderful and actually just as easy as riding a motorcycle.I was recommended this tour and I will recommend it to everyone I know who is going to Bali as well."

He had a great understanding of English which allowed us to ask many questions regarding Balinese culture and practices. It rained on the day we went, but as it wasn't cold it really wasnt an issue. Rain capes were provided by the tour. The bikes all seemed well maintained and met the requirements of the riding on the tour. Helmets are also provided. It was mainly a very easy ride, with minimal peddling required. There was an optional uphill 45min/10km ride at the end of the main ride, which my partner and I took up with a few others. It was the highlight of the ride for me, though does require a reasonable degree of fitness. The meals were of a good standard and the restaurant where we had breakfast had amazing views over the lakes and mountain side. All up, this was a fun and informative day out. We also went walking through a ride paddy and learnt a little about local farming practices. Highly recommended."

He was a delight and no question was too silly. He made the trip very exciting and enjoyable.The locations: High on the hills of the volcanos was where we started and what a view from the cafe for breakfast!! You must see this side of Bali to gain a true experience. Volcanic lava flows clearly visible (last erupted in the 1960s), the most incredible lake and awesome scenery. You soon realise that Bali is not just about beaches.The sights: we stopped at rice paddies, we rode through ride paddies, we went to a family housing compound in a village and walked right through it to view the living style, we visited craftsmen working on woodturning, we went through so many villages and watched people's day-to-day life, we went to the coffee plantation with the animals who 'poo' the coffee beans out. It was one thing after another and all that scenery along the way to enjoy.The ride: how easy: 25kms on a bike going downhill all the way. Our guide gave us the option of a 10km ride after the finish if we wanted some exercise.The food: breakfast was a bit um, unusual. Lunch was spectacular Balinese cuisine all you can eat buffet. I had a whole coconut opened up with the water inside for 50c!!! Soft drinks were free.Delivery from and to your door is fantastic.What a fabulous thing to do."

On the plus side, the cycling was very pleasant, the weather warmed up, watching and helping the rice threshing was also good fun. I didnt take the uphill option at the end but I realised that I could have done it later - it just sounded more difficult that it was and the lunch at the end was really very nice indeed. The kids really enjoyed the day, its a good way of getting them to do a bit of exercise in the fresh air rather than just blobbing by the pool. We were well looked after too, lots of guides looking after our group to minimise chance of disasters. I wish it had a bit more cycling and a bit less coasting, I regretted missing out a little more work on my flab."

We then drove to the coffee plantation which was also great. Got to try different coffees and teas. Bought some Luwak coffee which was probably overpriced but was yummy. The bike ride was great basically all down hill, through some beautiful countryside and villages. The stops we made on the way were also interesting and our guide gave us lots of good information about Balinese customs and way of life. The trip finished with a delicious lunch. Would highly recommend this tour."

The meals were very good, especially the buffet dinner served at their private restaurant. Just note that the dinner is late, around 2pm, so don't make any early dinner reservations. The bike ride is a smooth 25km ride almost all downhill. Very easy and can be done in athletic sandals. Heels and leather dress shoes were worn by some and are not recommended. There was a visit to a garden and coffee plantation where you can buy the lewak cat coffee. The guide,\"Pahnk\" was informative and brought humor to the tour. Recommended, just be sure to ask your hotel what they are making in commission."

My initial choice was the Mt Batur trekking tour however due to insufficient numbers I was recommended to do the eco cycling tour instead. I didn't expect much initially, however I was extremely happy throughout the tour and was glad to have made the choice of taking part in this tour.The day started off with a pick up from the place I was staying at in Ubud. We drove nearby to take in the scenery of terraced rice paddies and continued on for about another 30 minutes to our breakfast location near Mt Batur. The buffet style breakfast was delicious (banana pancakes were good) and the scenery amazing. After breakfast we moved on to the starting point for the bike ride where we chose our bikes and began our journey...I don't want to give away too much about the tour, but seeing and giving high fives to the local children and just feeling the wind on your face as you cycle down the slopes really made my day. The small stopovers/visits throughout the tour were really interesting and fun. Near the end of the tour you will be given a choice to either continue cycle downhill or add a bit more exercise and cycle uphill. I chose the latter option and survived. There were some really difficult moments where you wished you could just cycle downhill, but the extra work made the journey more rewarding in the end. The lunch served after the tour was delicious! It was nice to talk to other friendly travellers over lunch.The tour is definetly mostly downhill and even if you're not overly confident at cycling i would recommend this tour as it is quite easy. If you can, choose a day with sunshine!"

Our tour guide was excellent, funny, and very knowledgeable about Balinese life and was always eager to tell you more. The food is also excellent. The breakfast included pancakes, traditional balinese rice with nuts and coconut as well as black rice porridge which I fell in love with! The lunch was also very excellent. It's also buffet style and it was the most delicious Balinese food I've had on my trip so far! Chicken Satay, smoked duck and chicken as well as various rice, noodle and vegetable dishes. You also visit a coffee plantation where you get to see them hand roast the beans. Coffee sampling was also a nice experience. Highly recommend to anyone looking for a nice easy ride in the countryside, excellent food and a fun way to explore Balinese culture!"

This bicycle tour provided a great introduction to Balinese culture and allowed us to see the real Bali outside of the tourist zone, even though it was a tourist trip. They also fed us some great food. The bike ride itself was not strenuous as it was all downhill, so if you are looking to burn your quads and your calories, this may not be the trip for you, but it was a wonderful scenic, cultural, and if you let it, spiritual experience. Finally, as a side note, I accidentally left my shoes on the van after the ride. The proprietor of the company made the grand effort to see to it that those shoes were delivered to the door of my hotel that same evening. An all around professional experience."

Pick up on time, tour guide was informative, friendly and spoke very good English. The bikes were fine for the job. This tour gives a very good insight into life of Balinese people and a taste of culture. Its easy going almost all downhill so little peddling.The day starts with a reasonable breakfast at Kintamani and a tasting session at coffee plantation nearby. It ends with a Balinese banquet. In total theres only about 22 km on the bike but the whole day is complete with numerous stops at points of interest. This is not a bike tour for the lycra clad types who want to sweat it out up hill and roam for miles."

But one of the guides volunteered to have him on an extra large child seat. The experience was infinitely better than if my son had travelled in the van.The uphill rides were a bit tough for me as i was riding with my daughter but the guide was often close by to help push the bike when necessary.

Overall, the experience is wonderful and completely different from just window shopping we normally do at our own countries. Come and think of it, even though it rained heavily towards the end of the trip and my hubby fell down(haha what a day for both of us), I learnt that Bali weather could be very hot and harsh; so we liked the weather and people in Bali. We cannot blame weather on Bali Budaya Tours and we liked its itinerary, its well planned and organised. I booked the tour for 2 of us two months in advance and they did pick us up. We feared of \"no show\" from them as we were not living in central Ubud but at outskirts away from central Ubud."

After the volcano, we visited a garden and \"Punk\", our guide, explained the various plants and their uses. (Don't buy the \"cat-poo\" coffee though, Australian customs confiscates it on arrival). Then onto the bikes and off we went, stopping to visit a typical balinese family compound on the way and later to thresh some rice in a rice field. The ride is 25 easy kilometres, mostly downhill. Bikes were geared, so very short uphill intervals were easily managed. We experienced a torrential downpour that lasted for most of the ride, but they provided us all with ponchos, so on we went, our boys thought this added to whole experience! Ended with a great lunch, then bus back to hotel. Trip took a full day, and was excellent value, with breakfast, lunch, water, all included, all toilets were clean, and special mention to Punk, our great guide, who had a great quirky style."

Kilometer after kilometer of beautiful village (and rice-paddy) scenery was the highlight - and this was punctuated by timely visits to places of interest and informative discussion by our very knowledgeable and articulate guide \"Punk\" (probably not his real name....!) A delicious Balinese lunch was our reward at the end of the 25kms - with the organizers threatening to charge us double for our day out if we didn't go back for seconds! There are no hidden costs with this tour and no shifty visits to markets to entice you to go shopping.

The groups or not to big, so it feels very personal and they had attention for everybody. In the morning you have a lovely breakfast with a nice view at the mount Batur. After breakfast we visit a natural plantation and get some information of the local plants,... You get the opportunity to taste different kinds of fruit and coffee. We saw the civit cat who makes the most expensive coffee in the world :-) The bikes were made on your size, so it was comfortable to ride. The ride itself was 95% downhill and you have to use more the breaks than the pedals. Its very quite on the road and you visit a local village, volunteers work, rice fields,... You can take at the end the option for 8 km uphill, but in the heat of the sun think about it very well. We decided do skip this part (as the rest of our group) The meal at the end was perfect. Very nice restaurant. The crew is very responsible, speak English very well and or fun to communicate with. Especially Darma who can speak Dutch a bit :-)We found this tour so great that we organized the discovery east tour with diving with them. This day was perfect to, but it was just the two of us... The royal garden is worthwhile to visit. The diving place was awesome. We saw the uss Liberty wrack with many many different kinds of fish. Thanx Bali Eco!"

We got to see an actual village and people living and working. Our guide spoke perfect english and was VERY informative on everything. It was just such a magical day!If I could do something differently, I would love to have brought little presents for the kids we saw along the way. They are so fun and love the try to practice their english with you. If you do bring something, make sure you bring ALOT of whatever it is because there are TONS of children and you wouldn't want to leave any of them out!Now, after reading the last review on this company, it suddenly occurred to me that we may have gotten sick from this place as well. I really couldn't pin it down, but it very well could have been the coffee. Our little bout wasn't too miserable, but still... just be careful. Don't let this determine whether or not you do this tour, because it is definitely something not to be missed, but just use hand sanitizer and be careful. The lunch really is as good as they say... I couldn't stop eating! There were little vegetable rolls wrapped in lettuce that could have been the culprit as well. On the way back to the hotels they offer to drop you off in the Monkey Forest. We took this option, and the guide is able to get you in for free. It was a nice way to combine both activities because our hotel was a little out of the way! This tour is a definite MUST DO! You won't be disappointed!!"

I am not a good bike rider, but a friend sent me a link to this tour and suggested I go. its very slick, very interesting, a big itinerary for a day, but just enough pauses to not feel rushed. there are a lot of people in smaller groups going at the same time, but you manage to not feel like cattle roaming about in groups as they juggle the stops and clearly the guides stop at differenet places. I got a bit of the giggles imagining what the Balinese must think of all these people zooming around on bikes, saying hello, and taking photos. but it pretty much seems that this must be a normal day for them!As mentioned above, I am not a strong bike rider. I got a little nervous as we set off, but settled in and enjoyed it immensely. I stayed at the back the entire time, and there is a front and back guide person. There are also enough pauses on the way that I caught up each time and didnt feel left out or too slow. there is also the mini-bus behind at all times, so if you get tired or too hot, you can opt out. The biking is on mountain bikes, I managed to nab a soft looking seat, which I was grateful for. there are potholes and some rougher areas, but I am pretty sure if I can bike it, probably anybody can! lots of age ranges on the tour, and very cheerful guide Joe, who was seemingly indefatigable!the whole day is much more than I had imagined and I felt really good value for money. highly recommend the experience, it is a great way to see the countryside. excellent food and very well organised."

I had done some research on different bike tours and had read all the great reviews so when the tour guy at the hotel tried to get us to go on a different bike tour I booked direct by phone with the company myself. The booking was taken by a lovely lady who spoke perfect english and gave us clear intructions about pick up time and what to expect. We were picked up on time had a fantastic guide who was very informative , friendly and funny.We had breakkie at the Volcano, Fried Rice, Banana & chocolate pancakes, some funny stuff called black pudding and lots of fruit , more on this later! We were then got back in the bus for a short drive to the Coffee plantation for some tasters which was ok but to be honest could have given this a miss just wanted to get on the bike . The bikes we were given were all ok none of our group of 12 had any problems, our helmets were fitted properly by the guide and we were given a short talk about do's & dont's. I'm not a huge fan of bike riding but as it was mostly down hill I decided to give it a go and was so glad I did. We through rice paddys, saw and participated in rice harvesting , visited a village compound and saw the real Bali. I took along some small pressies for the village kids ( small bouncy balls and Lolly necklaces and braclets.) It was wonderful to see their excitement and gratitude and shreaks of laughter once they realised what to do with the balls. My teeneage son really enjoyed handing the gifts out and was a real eye opener for him. The village people were amazing along the way all smiling and yelling out hello such happy contented people considering how little they have nd how they live. We finished off with a yummy lunch ovelooking rice fields. We didn't go to the monkey forest but could have on our way back if we wanted to. I would very much reccommend this tour, they are very concious of safety and there is a guide at the frount and back at all times as well as the bus following if your decide you have had enough.The only downside was that evening and the next morning most of us started to come down with the Bali Belly. By process of elimination we narrowed it down to the Volcano breakfast or the coffee tasting as the sickies didn't all eat lunch. We think it may have been the water in the coffee and tea as my husband did notice there was quite a bit of gluggy stuff at the bottom of his coffee cup at breakfast. None of the kids got sick thankfully so thats why we think it may have been the water in the coffee or tea.I have since read a few reviews and a friend has said he also thought he got sick from there as well. Unfortunately this did put a bit of a downer on the rest of our trip. Despite this I would definately do the trip again it was a fantastic experience not to be missed. I think I would just eat brekkie at the hotell first and definatey not drink any of the tea or coffee."

A coffee plantation was next on the itinerary where we sampled some Of the famous Luwak coffee as well as other various flavours. Darma our guide is extremely knowledgable showing us the different plants, trees and fruits. Next stop the bikes, they were ready and waiting for us and all in good condition, water was provided whenever we required it. The cycling is 95% downhill so therefore suitable for everybody, although there is an optional 8km of steep uphill riding at the end, or of course you can the lift back to the restaurant.Our ride took us through paddy fields where we took part in sifting the rice, temples, a typical family compound, that was a real eye-opener and of course the beautiful countryside. The children in the local villages are only to pleased to see you and all shout hello and what high 5's as you go through.Lunch was extremely tasty and typically Balinese, all in all a wonderful day with a great guide and lovely people, Thank you to Darma and his team."

Probably not for the serious cyclist, but great fun cycling along back roads, and not too difficult as its 98% downhill (just a couple of uphill bits). Lots of stops like the coffee plantation, rice fields, and a village. Our guide, Ring, was great and very enthusiastic and informative. The bikes themselves weren't great, though safe (I went through 3 of them, one had a puncture, another had the chain come off and we couldn't get it back on, and the guide gave me his which only had one set of gears instead of 2) but the day wasn't spoilt as a result. There were 15 of us altogether, and everyone was friendly. The lunch was good, though a bit dissappointing after reading the reviews saying it was the best in Bali... I'd definitely recommend the trip for others. (PS. I enjoyed the trip so much I booked a jungle trek with the same company, unfortunately the guide wasn't anywhere near as informative or fun, and the trek was very slow, though lunch was fantastic.)"

The scenery was breath taking-think Eat, Pray, Love, Julia Roberts cycling through villages surrounded by rice fields, We had 4 guides that took care of us and the kids, making sure we were altogether and safe. There was a bus following us (which had our belongings in it), which anyone at anytime could jump on if they felt fatigued. The ride was 25km, which went very quickly. Make sure you wear plenty of sunscreen and I would suggest sneakers, for comfort. Water is provided throughout the tour and lunch is enjoyed at the end of the tour. We have visited Bali many times and this, most definitely is one of the most fabulous experiences we have had. Lovely to share this with our kids!"

My 5 yr old went on the back of the bike and my 7yr old rode the whole way and loved every minute of it. It was fantastic. Eat up at breakfast as we didn't have lunch until 2pm and if we went to the coffee plantation it would have been 3pm. You do get a snack about 12noon but if you have younger children you may need something else. The lunch was delicious and the guides exceptional.The second tour was the East Coast Snorkelling; again with the kids. Our group was the only one on there and the guides were exceptional again. It was a very very long day with a 3 hour drive to the snorkelling. While the snorkelling was good I would say it wasn't worth a 3 hr drive. Driving through Ahmed was good. We did stop at a temple on the way. We went to the beautiful water gardens and then lunch again at 3pm!!!!! Not good when you have children and they can only eat so many chips to keep the hunger away!! Lunch was at a little beach with gorgeous rustic huts and handmade beach umbrellas and was again very delicious. A word of warning, they did not have kids prices for the snorkelling."

The trek was well organised and was fine. However when I asked the guide about stop off on the way back he said there were none and none were advertised. I disagreed but said no more but checked when I got back to my cottage and I had indeed been correct. I sent an e mail to the owner who acknowledged that stop offs were indeed advertised but had been dropped. He intended to amend the website accordingly at some future point. As it happens I went on a trip with Banyan Tree Cycle Tours some days later and mentioned that I had wanted to go to a spice farm but had been let down and they willingly went out of the way to offer it as an addition free of charge.I guess you need to make your own mind up given a significant choice of providers as to whether you want to go with a company who sees it as acceptable to advertise one of their trips as including aspects that they have no intention to deliver. In my case it didnt ruin my experience but if this is how they operate you may be less fortunate."

I was really suprised at how big an operation this Australian owned business is. There were a number of tourist stops, Kintamani, a coffee house with food garden and a Balinese house/village, before the cycling started. I personally was not into these stops and just wanted to get out and see the country side. Once the cycling started I enjoyed it more, but my bike had bald tyres. I did not choose to wear a helmet but I strongly suggest you do. It was kind of frustrating when less confident cyclists would stop in front of you going up hills!It was good how you did not run into the other groups during cycling, as the guides take their groups on different routes. The lunch was nice, but from the reviews on trip advisor I thought it was going to be amazing.It seemed as though families were having a great time, so probably best suited to families. I suggest going without any expectations and you will enjoy the day."

East Coast Snorkelling- Conditions weren't great the first beach we went to with the jap submarine, couldn't see a thing, was rough & steep getting into the water & even though it was a sunny day the beach is full of fishing boats so literally no room to even sunbathe on the rocks. Our group was a bit worried, but the guides took us to another beach closer to Amed which was awesome, clear water & black gravelly beach which you could sunbake on, a winner. The next stop was the Water Palace, a gorgeous place to wander, swim in spring water pools, interesting history. By this stage we were starving (esp the 4 kids in our group) so we were keen to head to white sand beach near turtle island, which was a fantastic spot, & good food but lunch was at 4pm!! Be aware that you will be travelling for about 4-5 hrs in the minibus on this trip, but the ride through the rice paddies, valleys, coast, cadidasa & past the biggest volcano is really quite enjoyable & you feel like you've seen the best of bali all in a day. Cycling Tour- Many great aspects to this tour, the volcano view, stopping at the villages & Coffee cultural centre, stunning rice paddy views & the meal at the end is huge with a massive fresh selection even for veggo's. The cycling is at a very relaxed pace as its all downhill & depending on the capability of the others in the group. Let them know when you book if you don't want to get stuck in a slow group!The guides were really excellent on both tours, helpful & informative."

The views were super, the village and information giving by the guides, the support we were given and the best meal that we had all the time we were in Bali this is a must outing. It is not strenuous in any way as it is mainly downhill and the little gifts that we had taken with us were accepted with such joy and appreciation. It really was a lovely day.

He took us off the beaten track and into the rice padis. We even got to help do a little harvesting! I highly recommend this tour. One word of warning...at the end of the downhill portion of the ride, we were given the option to hop in an airconditioned van and be driven to the restaurant for lunch, or continue riding the last 10 kilometers which was mostly all uphill. Unless you are in really good cycling shape...do yourself a favor...hop in the van."

Remember reasonable shoes though, the rocky sections would be tricky in flip flops. After breakfast, the cycle trip was a real pleasure.

You are collected, then taken to breakfast at Penelokan overlooking a crater lake (breakfast consisting of different rices etc and (very good) banana pancakes), then to a coffee plantation, then to bike ride for approx 2 hours during which time you stop to visit rice fields and to walk through a home - then are driven to a (very good) lunch. The ride is nearly all downhill and with a guide at the front and back so you do not get lost and so that it doesn't matter if you stop to take photos etc. I have been on this tour twice (once in Feb with my 18yo daughter and once in Sept with my husband) and really enjoyed it both times. The guides are knowledgeable and friendly and competent. The bikes are good. The roads have lots of pot holes in them but the riding is not fast. At the end there is an 8km or so uphill ride with the guide for anyone who would like something more challenging. The tour groups are not very large (e.g. 12). Of the two trips I have done there was only one person who did this, but he thought it was good. The only thing is that the morning seems to go for some time until you get on the bikes (at around 11) (through pick-ups, breakfast, coffee plantations) but through that is a great time to just relax or to mix with the fairly small group. Highly recommended, and I will do this again."

We drove into the centre of Bali for about an hour, if I recall rightly. When we arrived at our destination we had a decent breakfast in a nice restaurant with an awesome view over the valleys and rice paddies.After that came the cycling. Despite the title of this review, it isn't really that hard. Most of the first half was downhill, and we barely had to pedal. In between freewheeling down the [mostly] good covered roads, we stopped in a traditional Balinese compound where our guides showed us the layout of the houses, vegetables and fruits being grown and harvested, and further down the road stopped to see a woman threshing rice (and had a quick try ourselves). The last hour or so was harder work as the ground had levelled out and undulated up and down a bit, and there was a tough stretch on a mud track through a rice field, which caused a couple of crashes and tumbles into muddy water! Don't wear your best clothes for this one...After we were done, we went to a property belonging to the owner of the business where we had a really, really good meal, and were then driven back to Ubud.It's a really enjoyable day out, and professionally run, with helmets, decent bikes, plenty of water, bananas for stops in the road, and cool towels at the end of the route. There is also a support vehicle if the exertion is too much for you, though the pace is quite leisurely - but by the end, if you are as unfit as I am, you will feel like you've had enough physical exercise for a whole week!Thoroughly recommended."

Our guide was extremely patient with my lousy cycling skills :p, he slowed down and waited for me while i attempted to cycle around the portholes. By and large it was a great cycling trip, mostly downhill cycling, only about 30% of the roads had portholes. We cycled through the villages and ricefields in Ubud, our guide shared with us about the Balinese way of life. An educational trip indeed! :)"

Had looked at a number of cycle tours on tripadvisor: this had good recommendation so chose this one....and extremely good. Eco is a big and professional company: we were one of several teams of cyclists of theirs that we saw on the routeDay started with pickup from villa in an airco'd minivan. We went as a team of 12 guests and 2 guides. A better than expected breakfast (OK, not sheraton, but still very good) overlooking Lake Batur. Bikes were pretty good: my gears all worked, brakes fine. Helmets were not great but not bad. Then 2 to 3 hours of cycling and visits: 20km slow downhill: a drop of just 700m in altitude so quite casual with minimal climbs. There is an optional 8km extra with 160m of climbing which 4 of us did. Finished with an excellent lunch.Positives:The handful of stops and a look at real life. Very interesting.  A visit to fruit plantation, as well as coffee tasting (this was all included, so not extra except for Luwak coffee if you wished it) A family compound to look round A rice harvest observed  A visit to the preparation of a communal funeral Eco pay the local villagers for this I understand, so a partnership and non-invasiveYou go at your own pace: just rolled downhill, so not a race. Relaxing and interesting. We had a guide at front and a guide at the back of our 12 cyclists: and then a bus behind that. So if you had had a problem, it would have been easily solved.Our guide was superb. Easy going (no hassle for tips which was appreciated) and very informative. Overall, best trip we did during our vacation"

For someone that has not been on a bike in over 10 years, this activity was one that I was not looking forward to! my husband was eager to do and it because he has given in to the many spa and shopping trips, I decided to reluctantly go. After the fear of crashing into someone or falling off my bike had gone, I had really enjoyed it. It was a pleasant surprise!! Our guide was really lovely and was full of information. The day was gorgeous and we had a lovely bunch of people in our group. After the ride we had a very tasty lunch back at their restaurant. The price of the the tour was excellent value, considering it covered pickup and drop off to our hotel, breakfast and lunch... it was all unbelievable!!! Just like the traffic back to Seminyak from Ubud!! Would definitely recommend it as a must do in Bali!"

This was an okay day, it was nice to see the countryside, but the downsides were that we were one of the last buses to arrive at the bike pick up point so there were some pretty ordinary bikes left. I would have liked to do the more active/up-hill optional section at the end of the tour but not on the bike I had. Also, the group was quite large, maybe 15 people, and we didn't do the following which was listed on their website:* \"stop at a Balinese plantation (where you learn of the medicinal and culturally important uses of local plants, the process of making coffee and see many of the spices you have used in cooking and tropical fruits growing in their natural environment\"* \" get to sample many exotic tropical fruits, local herbal teas and coffees, including Coffee Luwak, the unusually produced and most expensive coffee in the world). \"* \"stop off at a village temple\" * \"go for a short walk in the rice paddies to see villagers planting and harvesting rice (you can join in)\"Yes the breakfast and lunch was nice and they acomodated our special no meat or dairy requests, and the towel was nice...but I was generally a bit disappointed, especially since our friends recommended another tour and we thought we would see more on this one. We did go to a village house, stop at the Banyan tree and stop to point out a lady drying rice."

Our guide was excellent, informative and aware of safety issues. We were given a glimpse of rural life and how hard life as a rice farmer is. The beauty of the countryside is breathtaking and it totally changed our image of Bali as too touristy and to be avoided! The food was great for breakfast and lunch and the optional uphill ride at the end of the tour meant that we felt like we had done some exercise. The price was very competitive and felt good value for money. A visit to a temple would be the only thing that would have improved the tour and a little bit more time to take photos but the group we were in was keen to go quite fast. We loved the activity and would highly recommend anyone to go on it if they want to get away from the town for a day."

I booked with a local tour operator on Monkey Forest Road and was able to get a 10% discount for booking for 2 people and paying cash. The tour itself started with buffet breakfast at Kintamanu overlooking Mt Batur and then taking a stop at a coffee house where you learn about the different types of coffee grown in Bali. Both my boyfriend and I had new bikes (apparently his was only 2 weeks old) which were great and the riding was almost completely downhill so you don't need to be fit or particularly good at riding to enjoy the trip.We passed through a number of local towns and the locals were incredibly friendly - I just wish I had taken some pens to give to the kids who asked for them for school. We even got the chance to get our feet dirty and help planting some rice and walk around a local compund. Most of our group didn't bother riding up the big hill at the end but rather jumped on the bus and headed to the incredible buffet lunch.Heaps of fun and lots of informative stops along the way made this a great tour!"

The bikes were in good condition, the guide was informative, the food was good and we saw what was the real Bali. The only downside was as we were one of the last groups of the day, there were not many children's bikes left and our 8 year old had a fairly substandard bike. We would also recommend paying by cash.

We were picked up half an hour later than agreed, and our driver drove like crazy. I think we were lucky to survive! Moreover, he drove the wrong way and we ended up promoting almost four hours after we left our hotel. Gosh!When we finally arrived, the australian owner was receiving us, and apologized and said that he would make it up for us again. We just got 40 minutes snorkeling and was then passed to the next snorkel site (another wreck). Here, we only had 20 minutes to snorkel around. It was very stressful.From here on we went to a water temple, where the australian owner once again was stressful, hazzeled us around so we didn't get a good chance to see the attraction. Forward to a secluded beach where we had an excellent dinner of freshly caught fish that were grilled. Unfortunately, there just wasn't enough fish for every one!On our program they also mentioned that we would see a bat temple, but there was not the time to do that.All in all it was hectic, stressful and certainly NOT a good trip. We can not recommend anyone to participate this tour!By the way, he didn't maked it up for any of us.- Kenn & Iben"

A satisfactory breakfast of fruit, nasi goreng and pancakes was outshined by the magnificent view below. After breakfast a stop at a coffee roasting place was the next stop before we chose our bikes. Our cycling trip included lots of downhill coasting, beautiful vistas, small villages (who were preparing their decorations for Galungan!!!) and rice paddies. Our guide \"Joe\" was a great guide. There was water provided and a banana at the Banyan tree stop. Joe was right there with his first aid kit in hand when one of my son's took a tumble and scraped his leg. There were alot of potholes to avoid but other than that it was a very manageable ride. The visit to a village compound was very interesting and a real eye opener to how many families live in Bali. The bike ride ended with a cold towel - much needed - and a short bus trip to a buffet lunch. The downside of the day was the long trip home which included a stop at the office so we could pay by credit card.(We didn't take enough cash) I would suggest the company invest in a portable EFTPOS machine that could be used at lunch-they have many groups meet up at the restaurant and I am sure I was not the only one ready to get home for a swim. Traffic was pretty bad in Bali at this time. This was only a minor annoyance - great tour, great family day out!"

My friend and I chose Bali Eco Cycling from a selection of various cycling tour companies and I am very happy we made the choice. The tour was well structured, professionally run with a few nice personal touches from our guide that made for a memorable cycling tour. We were collected by a van in the morning and taken to Mt Batur for a great breakfast spread, after which we were taken to a coffee plantation where we were able to sample the local produce. From here we collected our bikes and the guides made sure all guests had well fitting helmets. As a mountain biking enthusiast I was pleasantly surprised to see the mountain bikes were all roadworthy and in sound condition!The next few hours were spent going for a (very) easy spin through small villages and terraced rice paddies, the pace of the ride dictated by our speed and tendency to stop at random for photos. Our group had a guide, a sweep rider and even a backup car which was very impressive.Upon completion of the ride we were treated to a fantastic buffet lunch whereby I was able to gorge myself to capacity on chicken, duck and other good quality and well prepared dishes.For the money spent it was a very memorable day. I would classify the riding as easy and even a novice rider, or someone who never rides a bike regularly , would find it manageable. Being the backpacker, penny-pinching type of traveler that I am, I am usually skeptical of organised or arranged tours but this is a professionally run outfit and our group was very impressed by the service. It is owned by an ex-pat Australian and they did a top job of looking after the guests. I highly recommend this group to anyone looking to do a cycling tour around Ubud, certainly beasts sitting in a coach or taxi all day!Book through the official tourist information office, and the corner of Jln Raya and Jln Monkey Forest, across from the art markets."

Three of us booked the bicycle trip from top of Volcano, through the rice paddies etc. It was fun. We (8 of us) were driven up to the top of the Volcano for a buffet breakfast which was delicious, we were then driven down a short way to visit a coffee/spice farm which was so interesting - were able to taste a sampling of coffees including the \"cat poo - most expensive in the world\" (over rated) one as well. Our guide spoke perfect English, was so knowledgeable and proud of his country. After the farm everyone received their bikes and the 23 km downhill ride began. It was leisurely, through the back country, through rice paddies where we stopped to help them harvest the rice. We stopped at the 500 year old sacred Banyan tree, there was lots of fresh cold water on hand and we eventually came to the lovely Indonesian restaurant where we had a fantastic buffet late - more like an early dinner meal.There are many companies offering these trips BUT I would definitely recommend you go with the original company - you will not be disappointed."

Every tour had been amazing, especially Bali Sun Tours, which we booked through Viator. Our tour consisted of Batuan Temple, Tegenungan Waterfall, and Tegalalang Rice Fields. Our tour took the whole day. And we wished it wasn't over, because there's just so much to see and do. There were five girls in my group. We went to Bali for my friend's 40th birthday celebration. Imagine this...you got five girls, who think they're models....in other words, we're crazy about having pictures taken of ourselves. No one wants to be the photographer. And we love dance music. Last but not least, we love to shop. Our tour guide was a young man named Gus Dudik. He came to pick us up in Legian. He arrived on time, but us being girls always running late. I believe it was an hour drive to all the sites we wanted to see. And Gus was perfect for our group. He had all the music we liked to listen to, while other drivers had no music. It makes our day and drive more fun. Gus was our wonderful photographer. He was so patient with us American girls. Each of us were grabbing him, and pulling him aside to take pictures, because he just knew how to get a good picture. Some tour guide or driver would just stay in the van after they get you to the destination, but Gus would come along with us. He was like a friend to us already. We felt so comfortable with Gus that we wanted him to eat with us when he took us to the restaurant at one of our stop for food. We even treated him and gave him tips. He deserved it, because it takes a lot of patience to deal with us girls. I highly recommend Gus as your tour guide. We had so much fun at the temple, the waterfall, and the rice fields. He gives you great advice on where to eat and when to shop for souvenirs. I hope you will enjoy your trip just as we did. Thank you Bali Sun Tours for the fun and adventures!"

After that we went to the jewellery and painting. Even by the side of the road were so many amazing sculptures. The second part was the Temple was just a sight to see and Gusti had amazing local knowledge about it. Then the waterfall which was awesome. 165 steps down and 165 steps back up made for good exercise. The way down was fun and the waterfalls water was cooling. Finally the rice field was the depiction of the tour: Green.

Ok, if you like to buy stuff you might be right here,...The quad bike ride got the adrenaline pumping! If you want a scenic ride: Forget It! In this ride you go off road where the water filled track is often only as wide as the ATV itself. Going up and down the surprisingly hilly path is fun but sometimes even a little scary. Lots of fun and you definitely get wet and dirty (or was there only this much water because it rained the same day?)Then some more talking in the car and we were back at the hotel about 9 hours later."

Made Astama was our wonderful guide for the day - from the moment we stepped off the ship and were greeted by his smile to the end of the day when he took us back to the port - he was friendly- respectful and very professional. He spoke excellent English and went out of his way to ensure we saw what we were interested in seeing (as we did not have a lot of time available to us). His driving was excellent :-) He took photos for us which we really appreciated and it was terrific to have photos of both of us in the same photo for a change. We would highly recommend Made as a fantastic tour guide and Bali Sun Tours as a reputable tour company. Made showed us a wide variety of experiences in Bali and we have decided that we will return to Bali for a holiday and explore more that the island has to offer."

We booked the one day tour to Tanah Lot through Viator and were very much looking forward to our trip as it was highly recommended through trip advisor. After doing the tour I really can't understand all the positive feedback! We got picked up by Yoga around 8 in the morning (he even was a little early).As we read in the reviews before the people said it was possible to slightly change the programme. But when we asked him to skip the art villages and instead go to Tirta Empul he looked shocked at us and said that it's not possible because it's not in the Ubud area (we later checked this and it's not true). This was OK for us so we made the tour as it was. First we got to the Tegalalong rice terrasses but unless the other guides we saw around, Yoga didn't want to come with us so we had to find the way through the terrasses by ourselves which didn't work out that good. He also nearly gave us no explanation. Next stop was a coffee plantation. Yoga just handed us over to a lady who \"explained\" us as short and fast as possible the coffee making process and sat next to us the whole time during the tasting trying to sell us there products. You nearly felt forced to buy something. We didn't buy anything and when we came back to the car Yoga directly asked us if we didn't like it because we didn't buy...The stops in the \"art villages\" which are only shops were all similar:Yoga hands you over to someone and the give you one sentence of explanation(like you can pay with credit card or cash) and then chase you through the whole shop trying to sell something. Originally we should stop at 4 art villages. Yoga shortened the programme to 3 villages without asking us. Well we didn't say anything because the chance was high that we get no explanation and only get forced to buy something. Final stop around noon was the Tanah Lot temple. According to the time schedule described we should have reached it got sunset but Yoga already told us in the beginning that the tour is never that long. The temple itself was not very spectacular but OK and again we got no explanation at all. All in all I don't recommend this tour as they just try to make money and you barely get any information. Instead of doing this tour better get to the temple yourself (it might be cheaper) or do the Batur volcano tour organised by Dek Bud which was a highlight of our stay in Bali."

We booked all of our tours (with the exception of one & boy did we regret not also booking that one with Bali Sun Tours) with this company prior to leaving Australia to come to Bali and frankly, I was a little nervous. Once we arrived and our first tour kicked off on day 2 of our trip, all of my concerns evaporated. Our driver (named Made Les) took excellent care of us and explained so much to us about local customs, traffic conditions, pricing for goods and so much more. We did one other tour with another company and it was incredible re lack of quality compared to the expert service and consistent, quality service via email, phone and through our driver with Bali Sun Tours. I recommend this company to all Australians visiting Bali who want the gold standard of tours. Worth every cent (and still very cheap) as these drivers work hard to make sure your tour is above average in every aspect (and you are not ripped off). My tip is to ask for our driver named Made and always make sure that you tip your driver a decent amount (we have 100,000 Rp per tour) as the quality and good karma you receive back is bountiful. We will only use Bali Sun Tours for our trips to Bali. Highly recommended to all."

We visited Teganungan Waterfall, Batuan Temple, the Ubud Rice Terraces and last but not least the Coffee and Tea plantation where we tried a large variety of tea and coffee blends including the famous Luwak coffee.

We ended up not only visit these two places but also waterfall, rice field and woodcarving.Juni is a very friendly young man with fluent english and most importantly a good driver. He walked with us as tourguide and as well a photograper to help us with photos! Bonus as he takes good pictures!"

            "review": "Not sure what all the fuss is about?. I chose to book a sunrise trek on Mt Batur with Bali Sun Tours because the Groupon seemed like good value, and (unusually) we were organising a fair bit of our holiday in advance from Australia. Normally we just book things on the fly, but I was curious to see the difference it would make using a very highly rated company like Bali Sun Tours. The reviews of the company are outstanding, so from curiosity more than anything, we thought we would test it out. How much better could they be than all the other companies we knew you could use to book a sunrise trek? (This was not our first time in Bali, and when you arrive in Ubud almost every third shopfront is selling tickets on sunrise volcano treks and river rafting trips so its very easy to organise something when you get there).First of all, forget all romantic notions you have about climbing a volcano for sunrise! This is a HUGELY popular thing to do, and despite it being quite a difficult climb (vertical tracks up loose, rocky & sandy paths under torchlight in the dark) there might literally be 2000 other people doing it with you.Now this is not the fault of Bali Sun Tours, but when the full price of your tour is AUD$150 each you might expect a comprehensively guided trip - information about the geology, the environment, the volcano's history...You get absolutely nothing along these lines! As far as I can tell, Bali Sun Tours employ very nice drivers, with uniforms and modern cars with good air conditioning and heating - but we were told to be ready at our homestay for pickup between 2am - 2:15am...and at 2:45am there was still no sign of our driver. The car turned up at 2:50am (so we had been standing on the street in the dark waiting for 50 minutes) with a humble apology that we were made to wait, because he had to pick up other trekkers. Ok fine, but clearly there is a communication breakdown somewhere!Once we arrived at the starting point of the trek, we were introduced to our \"guide\" and I feel bad putting that in inverted commas, but honestly he was just an escort. Speaking very little English, he was a young, shy local guy who was more interested in hanging out with his guide mates (and I don't blame him, as a young shy kid being put in charge of random foreigners where communication is strained). The promised \"volcanic egg breakfast\" is a bit of a joke - I wasn't even sure were were going to get anything to eat because our guide didn't communicate with us what was going on once we reached the top. Eventually boiled eggs, hot bananas and white bread were delivered to us but they came out of a hut (and I'm pretty sure out of a saucepan on a gas cooker) - not out of the earth. Our guide forgot to offer us tea and coffee until sunrise was over and we were ready to leave - he was just doing his best, but I feel he could use some more guidance himself on how to be a good guide.I spotted other trekkers with much fancier breakfasts, and very engaged guides answering lots of questions - so all this made me wonder - what is all the fuss about Bali Sun Tours, when I'm pretty sure you could get exactly the same experience booking a trek through a company off the street and probably for less than we paid even with the Groupon discount?Overall I was disappointed, and would recommend lowering your expectations for the whole experience, as it is a very crowded, popular, touristy tour to do.But to finish on a positive, at the end of the day we had climbed a volcano and seen the sun rise, and eaten a hot banana sandwich at the summit, which you don't do every day..."

Picked us up from Seminyak early, and we were the first to arrive. Mastery of traffic in this chaos is a must, and he was excellent. Attentive to every need, and answered our queries. The bikes are quite old and worn out, with many jump starts needed, but they get the job done. The course isn't for beginners, it's designed to be rough going but it's worth the effort put into it! Even driving home we arrived quickly, worn out with no fuss.The photos are from the pit stop at the halfway mark. Cold water was well appreciated!"

He changed some of the destinations since we already had seen them, so he took us to new ones. Even better part is that he explained really a lot of things about Balinese culture and traditions, which we didn't know. Worth the money and time! Book with confidence"

He met us promptly at our hotel lobby at 0830am, greeted as cordially, asked about our points of interest, and provided as with water bottles. His car was impeccably clean and the air conditioner was on full blast. Putu was very funny and made us feel very comfortable. He took us to the best sightseeing places taking into consideration our selected target spots. Our tour actually extended way pass 10 hr but he still charged as the same. His attitude was always to please us. Since we liked him so much, we booked him again the next day. He didn't disappoint. Next time, I head to Bali, I will be sure to book again with this company, and specifically request Putu as our tour guide/driver/comedian/protector! Haha thanks again Putu!"

            "review": "Unforgettable first trip to Bali. My best friend and I took a trip to Bali to celebrate her 30th birthday. We decided to skip the tour packages offered at the airport and instead make a more informed decision by doing research on trip advisor and utilizing brochures we picked up. Bali Sun Tours received great reviews and because there were specific places we wanted to see, we booked a driver for 10 hours in hopes of going to places we had our hearts set on. The booking process was extremely simple. I sent them an email stating what I wanted and an agent answered quickly to set up the payment and instructions on where and when the driver would meet us. The next day Putu came to pick us up in the lobby of our hotel at The Mulia. He was excited and enthusiastic about the day ahead. We told him all the places we wanted to see and he also included suggestions of other destinations we might enjoy. Putu was full of knowledge because we had a million questions we wanted to know about Bali, the people, the culture, and the language. We got to see the monkeys in Ubud, rice terraces, and Gunung Kawi temple. At all of these places Putu knew the perfect spots to get the best pictures from. The next stop was a suggestion from Putu to Manik Abian Bali Agriculture. We weren't too enthusiastic about coffee and tea tasting but thought we would give it a try. We are so glad we did! We got to try cinnamon right off the trees, coffee bean plants, cacao, everything was just sensory overload. Then when we arrived at the area where we would have our tea and coffee tasting, we are amazed by the spectacular view. It was set high above what looked like a jungle, so peaceful and serene. We would have missed this experience if it weren't for Putu. Honestly, anything we were interested in, whether it was a specific type of cuisine or massage place, Putu had a suggestion. He took us to this delicious Thai place where the locals eat and a beautiful spa where we had a Balinese massage. We even told him we wanted to go and get fried bananas from a street vendor. He took us to a place and got out and ensured it was freshly made and ordered for us. The best part is that during our drive to each destination Putu taught us so many phrases that we could use during our stay. We learned \"how are you\", \"good morning\", \"thank you\" and so much more!!! I cannot express how thankful and blessed we are to have had such an amazing experience in Bali, and it was all because of Putu. We are already planning a trip back because there is still so much to see and the hospitality is probably the best we have ever experienced in the world. Thank you Bali Sun Tours and especially Putu, for making our adventures around Bali unforgettably wonderful. See you next year!"

We began the tour at 8:30 and returned 17:00. The waterfall was beautifull and peacefull to see because it was very quiet. Ubud was very busy, but we enjoyd ourselves by shopping at the Marketplace. We visited the sawah's and the plantation where they produce the coffee luwak (very tasty). Tanah Lot was very pretty to see, but was also very busy. Overall is was a very good trip, also thanks to our driver Putu."

Next we went to ULUWATU temple where we got some beautiful pictures that Made took for us. We also got to see heaps of monkey's. Be careful of the monkeys hear though because they will still your glasses, hats and even water bottles. I seen them jump straight on to one girl. Next we went to PADANG PADANG beach which was also beautiful and the water was really nice to swim in. Next we had some spare time so our amazing tour guides took us to have a look at another beach called Dreamland Beach which was also really nice. Last stop was JIMBARAN BAY where we stopped for dinner and to watch the sunset. My partner and I both dont eat seafood and that was all their was on the menu so we just had some drinks instead.

Since we enjoyed this so much we then proceeded to book the volcano trek with Nyoman, once again this was a great experience and our volcano guide (Made)was great... He seemed to be the most fun guide we came across during the trek! Today we visited the temple on the lake, the twin lakes, another monkey forrest and tanah lot... Again it was a fun day. These trips have allowed us to visit the 'real bali' away from all the commercial beach resorts... Id highly recommend giving these trips a go.

This was my sister in laws first time in Bali, While we have been many times before and have experienced different tours in bali. We had bad experience last week with other company also booked through Groupon voucher. They did not give us what we had in itinerary. WE had also booked groupon voucher for 8 hours driver with Sun tours. We knew we wanted to go to the zoo and ubud so asked Sun tours to helow with itinerary,. The office staff were very helpful in working this out. To our delight and my relief we were sent An exeptional driver who was fun, taught us how to say new words in Balinese and gave us a history lesson as well. His van was clean and tidy and nothing was too much trouble. Thank you Sun tours for sending us Nyoman Widana, he is an asset to your company"

He was efficient and effective and ensured that we fully utilised our time over the two days we had him as a driver. He went out of his way to ensure we were comfortable and my mother was well looked after. He was sociable and very aware of our needs as travellers. I would recommend him and his service to anyone looking for an affordable driver, tour guide and friend."

After seeing excellent reviews about Bali Sun Tours we chose them to assist us in seeing all that Bali has to offer.In those 7 days we did about 7 planned tours Bali Sun Tours has to offer (below) plus we were also able to customise our own itinerary using the private driver services and we had the same driver- Made for the whole trip including Airport Transfers.Our Private driver Made, he was an excellent host, always made us fee comfortable and was very patient with us even when we wanted to stop for food/ bathroom etc His English was excellent, and was always able to answer questions we had about Balinese culture and traditions. He also helped us communicating with locals and making sure we weren't paying too much when bartering. The car we traveled was very comfortable and clean with air conditioning and a cooler/esky in the back where we could put our drinks to have ice cold. Using Bali Sun Tours took the stress away from us for airport and hotel transfers. It made our holiday more enjoyable not having to worry about how to get around. We made great friends with Made and we recommend Bali Sun Tours to our friends wanting to visit Bali. These are the services we used from Bali Sun Tours. Safe to say our review is credible with the amount of tours we did with them;-Eat Pray Tour-Bright Bali Tour-Elephant Ride Tour-Bali 3 Island Cruise-Sunset Dinner Cruise-Sunset Dinner -Fast Boat to Gili Islands. Thank you to Agung & Made once again for making our Bali experience wonderful."

My partner Hollie and I enjoyed a day with friends, cruising about in the back of Oka's very nice and very clean car - We were taken to some temples and a small Luwak coffee plantation, which were all very nice - Oka was very knowledgable, friendly and very relaxed - he became one of us, rather than 'just-the-driver', which was really nice and was happy to mould his schedule around how we were feeling. If we wanted to leave, we left, wanted to sit under a tree, he sat with us and waited. Fantastic. He also took us to the most amazing little 'local knowledge' hole in the wall Warung, where we were served delicious pork, rice and vegetables, which cost around $4.00AUD per plate - You can't beat that. Highly recommend booking Oka for your next day tour! I sure as hell will be when I return to bali."

Our guide waited patiently while we explored each place and gave us good information about the sights and their history. He also took us to some nice places to eat. Thoroughly enjoyed the tour, it is a great way to see the place when you are there for a limited time like we were (3 days only, which is far too short to do Bali justice!). We hired our driver again the next day to take us up to Kintamani and a few other places we wished to visit in Ubud."

The day was great, made drove us to the destinations and gave a great insight into each one before letting us head off and explore by ourselves. Following this we used Bali Sun Tours to arrange our rafting, we combined this with private driver service as we wanted to go to Seminyak after. Rafting was great, safe well organised and absolutely beautiful to travel down the ayung river experiencing the rapids.On our way to Seminyak, Made was explaining the other parts of the Island that we hadn't seen. We were really interested in seeing Nusa Dua and Uluwatu, we arranged to meet Made again for a tour of this area which was great, we did watersports, went to padang padang beach which was beautiful then to Uluwatu temple where Made shown us around and taught us about the hindu religion, we saw the beautiful cliff top views before we watched the Kecack fire dance. Then it rained heavily so we headed back to Seminyak.Made and Bali Sun Tours made our Bali experience - so glad we chose them, request Made when you book!"

We\u2019ve had him twice now and this guy has good mannerism, he is clearly highly experienced. His knowledge of Bali customs and traditions is impeccable. Aldo provided us with the Bali experience we wanted to see on our travels such taking us to temples, the monkey forest and other fantastic places. He did not send us to any dodgy or non-reputable areas. Bali\u2019s road and busy traffic areas can be questionable at times, however having Aldo Made as our driver made us feel safe as secure. If you want to have safe and truly genuine experience in Bali, I highly recommend going with Bali Sun Tours and travelling with Aldo Made as your guide. He is great representative of Bali\u2019s culture and to his travel agency company. I think his Boss should promote him as he has a lot of potential. Truly a great asset to his organization."

Local to Ubud, he has excellent advice on the best local food holes on our tour route and Seminyak. After asking him about good local food he took us to an excellent hole-in-the-wall Babi Guling Warung. It was amazing. He is a safe driver and made us very comfortable on the hectic roads. As well as this, he gave us valuable information on the temples we visited and any questions we had about Bali in general. He was extremely kind and patient with my friend's 18 month old baby (you can book a baby seat but must do so a few days in advance as it may not be available). As well as this, I found Bali Sun Tours very easy to communicate with via email whilst I was still in Australia. I booked a couple of months in advance on a Groupon, and Padmi was so quick and helpful that I decided to book a few more tours with them. The tours were varied and we never felt pressured to.buy anything from local craft makers. The coffee tasting part of the Bright Bali Tour was so fun. We learnt much about the local processing and got to taste so many lovely coffees and herbal teas. Looking forward to River Rafting on Sunday :)"

Whilst the shopping at the end was not my favourite element, it was still interesting and all parties were kind and respectful with us just looking and not buying.Our day finished at about 1700 dropped back at our hotel.

We had a great day and our driver Lila was a really fun guy, who told us lots about the area, and his own life and experiences living in Bali. He also changed our tour around slightly to fit our requests and skip places we were less interested in seeing.The rice fields at Tegalalang were amazing, lush and green at the time we visited, and well worth stopping and the photo opp. We also really enjoyed seeing the artwork in the art villages and while closely accompanied through each shop, we didn't feel pressured to buy something and could spend time appreciating the different styles of art and skills that went into each piece. To be honest, we would be unlikely do this as part of a tour again though, and would research our own shops etc if we were interested in purchasing something and visit them separately. The paintings and wood carvings were really impressive and we were able to ask lots of questions; however, the silver/gold and batik may mostly be of interest to you if you are looking to make a purchase as they are really just large stores (less emphasis on how the pieces are made) but they do have some beautiful fabrics/ jewellery.  The Tegenungan waterfall was also very nice to visit. Quite busy compared to those in the Northern waterfalls we saw but we like waterfalls so enjoyed it. Didn't swim as was really rocky, and to be honest the water looked an unappealing colour but that didn't bother most people there. Also, it seemed pretty well maintained and kept free largely of rubbish which is always good to see in Bali :)Overall, a fun day, glad we booked through Bali Sun Tours, might have been a little more expensive than some day driver rates we had elsewhere but for us it was really worth it to get a driver who was very friendly, local, with great english and knowledge of the areas, and a nice comfortable/clean car for the day!"

We have let him choose our destinations, experiences and activities and every single time he has put together the most amazing fun filled days. There is never a dull moment with the funny, friendly and positive Attitude he has. If this is the standard Bali sun tours have for there drivers I'm sure all the others are just as good. We are walking away from this experience with another family member. I highly recommend Bali sun tours and Nyoman."

A wonderful full day tour with our informative and very pleasant driver Madei Aldo who was so very accommodating and helpful. Every stop was interesting the beautiful terraced paddy fields, the waterfall, the temple and when we did the craft villages there was never any pressure to buy goods. Our lunch stop was just so amazing with the restaurant located over water of the rice paddy fields. The Luwak coffee plantation was also so very interesting. We enjoyed the day immensely and thoroughly recommend this tour and don't forget to ask for Madei Aldo as your driver."

Tour guides always prompt in pick ups, vehicles safe & clean & information provided by the guide is well received. On this occasion we did the Sunset Bali Tour which went to Uluwatu Temple which is huge and definitely need some time to walk around & take in the magnificent views of the cliffs & sunset. At the temple we also watched the Kecak Fire Dance this started at 6pm and finished around 7pm, get there early to get a good front seat as it gets very busy.After the fire dance we were driven back to Jimbaran Bay where we went to a seafood restaurant for a nice seafood dinner, you select the seafood you want fresh from the tanks and get it cooked how you like & enjoy eating while watching the waves roll in.A great tour & highly recommend it, our guide Yoga was great, spoke very good English & provided great information about everything."

Had 2 young drivers on the 17/5/16 (can't remember names) but they were extremely friendly, well spoken and cheerful lads. Offered local advice for places to eat and drink and an insight into the Balinese lifestyle and culture. We did a tour to Ubud monkey forest, art markets, coffee tour (Kopi lewak) and rice fields. They also accommodated an extra stop for us to go and get a massage and lunch from a spa in the area. Unfortunately we didn't get to see the rice fields as it was 330pm by the time we finished our massage. The drivers were still happy to take us for no extra fee even though we'd gone well-over our \"half day\" tour. The monkey tour is a must and great fun for the whole family. You can buy bananas in the forest and have monkeys sit on your head for photos. Just ask one of the monkey forest staff. Art tour isn't my cup of tea and can probably be skipped for something else. Kopi lewak coffee making tour is great!! You walk through a local farm and the coffee making process from plant to cup is explained. You get a free sample of about 15 different kinds of teas made locally, some delicious, some not. Coffee is Rp$50000 per cup but well worth every penny."

Basically we planned our itinerary based on what was recommended in TripAdvisor, and we just handed over to Wayun to drive us to the places we want to visit for 3 of the days. Wayun is a really friendly and professional driver. Not only was he always on time to pick us up everyday, he was also very familiar with his directions. Wayun even took the initiative to change into a bigger car on our third day knowing that some of us have quite a bit of things to carry and thus might possibly compromise our leg space. We were really appreciative of the many small gestures he had done for us, and it was undoubtedly that the service he provided was excellent.Over the 3 days, we visited Tanah Lot Temple, Pasar Seni Ubud, Tegallalang Rice Terraces, Mount Batur, Tegenungan Waterfall, Rock Bar, Potato Head Beach Club, Jimbaran Beach and did river rafting on the Ayung River. We also had meals over at Bebek Joni, Naughty Nuri's and Habitual Quench & Feed. It was a pity that we could not visit the Uluwatu Temple on our last day due to the poor traffic conditions and we had a flight to catch, but Wayun was quick to suggest other places whenever we needed alternatives. Traffic in Bali can be pretty bad at times, but Wayun was always patient and positive, which made us feel very comfortable being around him.Definitely would recommend the places that we visited, but even more so for our driver Wayun. Visiting the places aforementioned would only be possible if there is a driver to take you around for the day, and of course having an excellent service provided by Wayun certainly enhanced the overall travelling experience in Bali.Do look for Wayun if you plan on visiting Bali and need a driver! PM me if you need his contact."

Be sure to bargain for a cheaper price especially if buying two tours. White water rafting facilities were Pretty basic and run down faculties by the river. But the boat instructor was brilliant! It was a nice small group just the 4 of us, unlike other tours which seemed to have about 30 people in many boats. It was a 2hour drive from legian, and the drive was uncomfortable and tiring. The lunch at the end of the river was traditional Indonesian food. The Mt Batur Volcano tour was VERY EARLY 2am pickup, arrived at the bottom at about 4am. There were only the two of us in our group and the instructor. He was very helpful and held my hand in the difficult areas of the climb and decent so I didn't fall. If you're fit, this climb will be fine. There were a few hundred people climbing at the same time, sometimes other groups were slow and the path was too narrow to overtake. The brochure says wear long pants, we wore shorts and got pretty hot & sweaty. But At 5:15 when we got to our spot for the sunrise, we got quite cold. I recommend shorts but pack a small blanket or jumper! Also bring a spare shirt! Our bus driver Dedik was awesome. After the volcano we went to Lewak Coffee which was awesome! Loved it! Then Dedik took us to the rice fields and To the Bebek restaurant in Ubud. Since there was only two of us (my husband and I) in the bus, it was like having a personal tour. Thank you Bali sun tours!"

He even rang the owner of our villa to make sure of the directions so he knew exactly where to go. Every time Nyoman came to collect us for a lift or for a tour he was on time and always full of energy ready to help us learn about Bali's customs and traditions. We learnt so much from him and he helped us to fall in love with Bali! (Which wasn't hard!) our day trip around Ubud was really good fun and he even brought us to a restaurant that was off the tourist trail so we had an amazing Indonesian meal looking our over the rice terraces with no other tourists around- this was really special. The tour was very reasonably priced. When we come back to Bali we will definitely be ringing Nyoman again and arranging all of our transport and tours with him and Bali Sun Tours. He is professional and very good at his job. (Note he may not even call what he does a job because he loves what he does so much!) Thank you again Nyoman from Kim and the rest of the group."

On the day, the first pick-up was over one hour late, one of the parties stayed at Vlad Bali Villa which was located in a complex that was out of sight (no signage, directions etc) so this was partly our fault. Communication during pick-up however, lacked efficiency and the fact we speak indo didn't help, quite frustrating. When we did get picked-up, the driver was extremely apologetic and was kind & courteous. The ATV was a little disappointing, the vehicles were old and poorly maintained, the facilities were quite poor (broken lockers and mediocre lunch) the guide's ATV broke down so he had to ride with me, and one of ours kept stalling, but it was quite fun. The whitewater rafting was AWESOME, the company used by Bali Sun Tours had a great facility, the staff was very friendly and the rafting was heaps of fun, absolutely loved it.

Agung was also very helpful via email when we were planning our trip from Australia. Thank you!"

He was very friendly and we loved having him show us around for the day. He picked us up exactly at the designated pick up time and not a moment later, which was great as we are used to other tour companies picking us up late. The tour included seeing woodcalving, silver jewellery making, going to a coffee plantation, walking through rice terraces in Ubud, experiencing 2 temples and the lunch spot Oka chose for us was great. Before we booked this tour, back home in AUS I emailed Bali Sun Tours and spoke with Padmi for extra information and i am very happy with the fast and helpful replies I got.Overall I am very happy with Bali Sun Tours as their staff provide excellent service for good value."

We asked to change the date of one of our bookings and it was so easy to do with them. Unbeknown to us we had booked a day trip to Ubud on the day of a big ceremony that was a few days prior to Nyepi Day & roads were to be closed. This would cause chaos for us and our driver so they again re-arranged my bookings to fit in with this. When we finally got our day trip our driver Putu was just awesome! Polite, funny and always happy to fit in with us and our requests. Putu lives in a small village near Ubud so he knew all the back roads to avoid tourist traffic. He even took us down through his village. I would highly recommend Bali Sun to anybody. We've already booked one tour with them for our October visit and will most certainly be booking another (when the voucher dates are extended on Groupon) Putu was an absolute pleasure to have as our guide and we will specifically ask for him again. Thanks Bali Sun & thanks PutuAndrea & Steve"

After purchasing a Groupon deal $90 (which was a bit cheaper then the online price) for two for white water rafting i emailed BST for a booking and padmi responded immediately! So efficient in answering all my queries and confirming all the details. We were located in nusa dua so our pickup time was at 8.30 am and we arrived at anout 9.45- So just over an hour. Our driver was de wa who was quite friendly. English is obviously not the first language but we were able to communicate w him just fine. And we were the only couple so it was a great! If only the aircon worked better.. Better then nothing i guess? A step up- prob offer wAter, mint and free wifi?Got to the rafting venue and we were handed over to marty our guide. A funny and happy guide who was able to speak english quite well. Just a few years older then my husband so they got on really well - shared a few smokes and a beer too.. Met 4 other travellers and promptly got all our gear, ready to start! The walk down to the start of the rafting is about 400 steps.. Approx 10min walk.. Steps are quite steep! The rafting was amazing! We were at the front so we faced all the adventure front on! Its ok to wear thongs thats what we did and it was perfectly fine. Remember to hold onto the rope when theres rocks!! A few of the other travellers fell off the seat a few times.. Hehe.. Whole trip was over 2 hrs and it was good that they gave us a break at about halfway. Prior warming the 300 steps back up is hard! Different route - stairs are not as steep but phew.. After 2hrs of rafting, hungry, high humidity and whilst very hot - the 300steps was a challenge! Take your time.. And work those sweat!!Back to the rental venue and a lunch buffet was provided. Only let down was the meal - bland rice and noodle and curry chicken w veggies and fruits as dessert.. You have to buy your drinks as well.. No water provided.Changing room was fairly clean. Towels and shower/change room provided.So overall a great experience! Im feeling sore now.. :("

He then organised for us to do a tour at the elephant camp the next day, even taking us past Tanah Lot temple on our way home. Due to his good hospitality, we requested him as our driver for our third tour, the romantic tour. This was lovely and included many highlights of south Bali (water sports at Tanjung Benoa, Padang Padang Beach, Uluwatu temple & sunset dinner at Jimbaran bay).

Our guide, Jules, was young, dynamic, informative and a real riot. He was such a pleasure to be with that we invited him to dine with us at lunch, which he was ever so grateful for.

Nyoman drove us (me and my girlfriend - mid 20s) around Uluwatu on a day trip from Seminyak. We took in Padang Padang beach (cliff jumping!), a temple and then a good old fashioned Sunday sesh in Single Fin (amazing sunset!) before taking us back to Seminkak that night. The guy is funny, patient, knowledgeable and above all very generous with his time and advice. We only had a short trip to Bali but when we come back we'll be making sure Nyoman is free to bring us around Ubud!"

Arrived and happily greeted us at the doorstep of our hotel in Ubud 15 mins before the agreed pickup time. We already knew that the day was going to be great. We were taken to Tirta Empul Temple to visit the iconic holy spring water temple but not before stopping first to take some quick happy snaps of the rice terraces near Tegalalang along the way. Oka has taken us to visit one of the coffee and spice plantations where they offered us free samples of coffee and teas. For all coffee lovers, this is the one place you will need to visit during your stay in Bali. Awesome aromatic flavours that would sure to give your taste buds a treat. Try the premium Luwak coffee or easily known as \"Cat-poo-chino\" made by the post part-digestive processing from the Asian palm civet.Towards the end of the day, Oka has drove us back to Ubud to visit Ubud Palace and the markets until finishing the day at a restaurant of his recommendations for a delicious suckling pig special. A tasty dish!We highly recommend Oka and Bali Sun Tours. We only wished that our stay in Bali was longer."

We found Bali sun tour through Groupon and wasn't expect much from them as the price was cheaper than the local agent offered. However our guide name Made made out our trip a memorable and at the end we hired him as a our private tour guide again on our last trip day. We had an awesome time on a day tour with Made to Ubud area (beautiful rice fields, ubud monkey forest, a coffee luwak plantation, Ubud art villages and a Ubud market)Actually, Ubud market tour wasn't in the program however, Made (the tour guide) generously negotiate the program and letting us to tour Ubud area. Made took us to Uluwatu temple, Kuta are shopping centre (Discovery mall) and Spa on our last day. We found that the massage price is a bit expensive than other places, we could have done a deal with the massage shop people but we didn't want to ruin our last day we paid what they offered.Car was clean and super cool. If anyone concern what to do with your luggage don't worry they will keep an eyes on your luggage. We carried all our luggage for our last day trip before going to airport, we didn't have any trouble with that.Made speaks English very well and friendly. Very polite, patient and knowledgeable. I will definitely recommend to all our friends.We are very satisfy of what they provided to us."

White water raftingThe ATV tour was very good, thrilling and exciting especially for first timers. You get to ride through several villages, on the open road, and also through rice terraces. Make sure to apply insect repellent though!The Let's Get Wet tour included parasailing, rolling donut, banana boat and jet ski - great fun for people who want a taste of what each of these are, you only get one round of each activity so it doesn't actually last very long but great fun. If you do this, remember to add on the Seawalker (albeit expensive) which takes you about 5-6m underwater under a helmet without the hassle of dive equipment. You can feed the fish and touch coral and it was truly amazing.White water rafting is at Ayung river, and it is quite an easy, breezy cruise down the river. There are rapids, but not the kinds you see in movies of course. So for all those afraid of falling into the water and stuff, don't worry, this tour is amazing. For all those who want more adventure, I'd suggest looking to do an alternative rafting tour at a different river.Last but not least, the ubud chocolate making and arts tour. This was highly disappointing and a huge letdown. It took us over an hour to get to the chocolate factory, the staff did not entertain us or acknowledge our presence and even after asking twice nicely to take us around to go through the process of chocolate making, they refused to bring us around and \"pretended\" they didn't speak English, or maybe the general staff's English is really poor. The only thing we got to do upon arrival is make some chocolate which was basically piping melted chocolate into moulds and topping it with whatever ingredient you chose. They somehow managed to give my partner's bag of chocolate to someone else and didn't bother notifying us until we asked them where our chocolates were as we realised we had been sitting around for 1.5-2 hours doing nothing. They didn't apologise for their mistake, and said we could make another batch of chocolates but would have to wait an extra 30-45min. We politely declined. The rest of the tour was just driving around to the different villages to see silver jewellery, stone carvings, wood carvings and paintings. I appreciate culture but going to those places was not worth it as they don't really show you how they've come to achieve the final product but just follow you around hassling you to buy products instead. The only up-side to this tour was we got to watch the elephants play and bathe and the sun bears enjoying the sunshine and eating whilst we were at the chocolate factory. padmi (tour booking manager) is really helpful, polite and responds promptly which made booking the tours and reconfirmations a breeze.all the drivers were awesome and friendly, good drivers as well (for those of you who know traffic in bali) and always early/on time.there are heaps of other tours offered, so make sure to check out their website. i'd highly recommend this company, just maybe skip out on the arts tours."

Very friendly and jovial. The rafting was good. Not too extreme. Make sure you apply sunscreen as you're out on the river for over 2 hours. Bring water with you if you don't want to pay an inflated price once you're there. Lunch was okay. Overall a fun day out despite a few downfalls."

Dance which was amazing to see .We then headed to a coffee farm which was absolutely fantastic aldo came through the tour with us and he was very funny and informative of the area. Following that we were off to monkey forest , the whole time aldo explaining places as we passed through and spoke often about traditions and culture . Monkey forest was amazing to see , all monkeys running free be careful of the monkeys as not all are friendly don't let monkeys see water bottle or bananas keep those thing well hidden :) and you will enjoy your day as we did . We then Went to a beautiful place for lunch I can't recall the name but it was very nice and the food was lovely .. Aldo was happy to stop along the way back to our hotel as I wanted to purchase some items for my Bali hut at home he helped me negotiate price and assisted due to the language barrier in the village I was so happy with my purchase it made my day ..

Although theirs a lot of rip off from tourist places in Bali, it's negotiable. Walk away or even dare to say No if you don't want to purchase or join anything. He is helpful in arranging itinerary and based on how everything can fit in with the time you have in Bali. All is well except the northCoast water sports which was a major rip off from the offered/given prices. I find it unfair based on skin colour or different nationalities. We paid 800,000rp just for 3 activities (seawalker excluded) which I feel was too much compare to the price that can be found in other websites.

Everything we did with Bali Sun tours on the other hand was worth the money, pick up in the morning was always on time by the very friendly Oka or Mardi, they knew a lot about the places we went to and had so much fun on the day tour and ATV riding that on Oka's recommendation we booked white water rafting as well. In fact he booked it for us for the next day which made it very simple, we didn't need to do anything. The activities we did were among the highlights of our holiday without them it wouldn't have been the same, thank you! And if we ever go again we're definitely booking directly through Bali Sun Tours"

Yoga was very professional and he went above and beyond his formal duties to make us feel at home. He brought us to Uluwatu temple and was even helping us to carry our two year old up the temple stairs, taking photos and telling us about the Balinese history. We finished the night eating seafood at Jimbaran Bay. I have used other private drivers in the past but I would totally recommend Yoga and would use him again if I ever go back to Bali."

You are briefed on safety and how you ride the bike, but that didn't help some of the people on the ride as one girl rolled her bike within 2 mins of starting. They are not as easy to ride as they make them out to be, make sure you eat your Weeties in the morning. The ATV ride was great fun and we navigated some challenging tracks, however given the amount of dust they should have supplied us with face masks. Lots of steep ascends and descends and some MUD!! The lunch at the end was also very nice.Overall a great time."

It was so comforting not having to venture out into the streets and haggle with the street vendors about prices, it was also great to have a contact person incase anything went wrong - On about my 9th day in Bali I was quite unwell & Surya had come to book some more activities for us, when I told him I was unwell he even took the time to go to the pharmacy for me and get some medicine which made me feel so much better!I would also like to mention that on the day we did Scuba Diving we had Gusti & Madi as our drivers for the day, they truly went ABOVE & BEYOND our expectations for the day, after scuba they were happy to take us to look around Ubud at the woodcarvery & gold / silver smiths which was not on the itiniary but they took us anyway, they also stopped several times along the way so that we could get photos with all of the lovely scenery & answered many of our cultural questions. They were hands down THE BEST drivers / tour guides that we had while in bali & I would highly reccomend them :) Thankyou SO MUCH Bali Sun Tours, you made our trip easy & stress free for all of our activities. Our happiness was definately your success. We will be in touch when we come back! :)"

For \"Lets Get Wet\" and \"Scuba Diving\", I was picked up from my hotel \"The Grand Bali Nusa Dua\" and was dropped to the beach where all the water sports activities were being performed. Although Bali Sun tour mentions on their website that they have shower and toilet facilities but these facilities are not in proper working condition. Toilets were stinky and were not suitable for use. Even the shower rooms were nowhere close to being called a shower room. All their trainers need to be polite. I wont book it next time.Next day, I was again picked up from my hotel with my wife by Bali Sun tour Driver \"Made Les\" for White Water Rafting. This time experience was completely different as the driver was very friendly and informative. For Water Rafting, we had \"Bo Bo\" as our trainer and he was amazing person and really funny. I would highly recommend rafting and ask for \"Bo Bo\" as your trainer and trust me you wont be disappointed. Toilets and shower rooms were in really good condition in comparison to water sport facilities and also they will provide you clean towels. Will definitely do it again with \"Bo Bo\".Next day, we were again picked up by our driver \"Made Les\" for \"Bright Bali Tour\" and that too turned out to be amazing experience because of our driver."

But the actual company providing the tour was Bali Sun Tours. We had a marvelous time with our excellent, friendly, knowledgable driver, Tude. We wanted to see the surrounding Ubud area, do some shopping, and end the day with the sun setting over Tanah Lot temple. He took us to the rice fields for photos and hiking, to shop at a wood carving place, batik and Balinese fabric production place, silver factory and Luwak coffee plantation. We had lunch at a very nice Teba Sari Resto overlooking rice fields and ponds. We were able to explore Tanah Lot, take some great pictures and catch the sunset. The perfect itinerary, and perfect guide. We were pleasantly surprised and would go Bali Sun tours again."

            "review": "The Best Tour Guide in Bali!. My friends and I recently took a trip to Bali. On one of our first days there we booked a tour with Bali Sun Tours. Gusti picked us up right on time from our hotel. His vehicle was spotless and we were happy to have him to navigate those hectic Bali roads! Gusti was very knowledgable about the sights we saw (including: Tanah Lot, rice fields, the Luwak Coffee Plantation, and the Batik factory). He was eager to answer all of our questions about the Balinese culture and the Hindu religion. He was also interested to learn about our lives and what our culture was like. We all quickly became friends. We really enjoyed our time with Gusti and decided to book more tours with him. On our second tour we went to Mount Batur for a sunrise climb. Unfortunately, I became very ill after 1km of hiking. I could no longer continue the hike and turned around. I found Gusti in his car with his girlfriend. I felt bad for interrupting their time together but they treated me like family! They allowed me to sit in the car with them and even gave me some local medicine to make me feel better. They were excellent company. Even though I was sick, spending time with them and getting to know them will always be one of my favorite memories of Bali. On our third tour with Gusti, he took us to WaterBom Bali. Gusti was nice enough to score us discounted tickets and even stood in line with us before we went in. As always, he was there right on time to pick us up and even went out of his way to make sure we had enough water for the rest of the night. On our final day with Gusti, he drove us around Kuta to a few more places we wanted to see and he also drove us all to the airport. We were so lucky to have met Gusti. He made our time in Bali much more special and I am happy to now call him my friend. Book this company for a tour! You will not regret it."

He picked us up in Ubud, where we were staying at the time, and we spent the day visiting the rice terraces, the Luwak coffee plantation, the handmade silver, paintings and Batik factory stores and then Tanah Lot Temple. Gusti walked with me while we were on the coast at Tanah Lot and answered my many questions about the Hindu religion, culture and customs. He was so nice and was curious about our culture too :) Later when we asked for a good food recommendation, he took us to a beautiful restaurant on rice terraces with floating huts and a wonderful atmosphere. He patiently waited outside as we ate our late lunch, even though we invited him to join us! We loved Gusti's company so much, we asked him via Facebook to also take us to take us to Mount Batur volcano, for a sunrise climb towards the end of our stay in Ubud. When the day came, he was promptly ready to pick us up at our early 2am start time. Despite the long drive through the winding, dark roads up to Mount Batur, Gusti was very skilled in his driving and I didn't feel nervous at all, which helped me get a little sleep on the way there ;)When we arrived, he set us up with a local climbing guide, Nyoman (who was so incredible!) and planned to sleep in the car while we climbed. Unfortunately one of our friends got very sick early on in the climbing and had to turn back, but Gusti and his girlfriend were gracious enough to make room for her to rest as well and even gave her a little medicine to help her. We were so so grateful for that! When we left Ubud, we were sad to say goodbye, but later on in our trip, while we were in Canggu, we decided to ask Gusti for transportation again :) On a different day, he picked us up at our hotel in Canggu and took us to Waterbom Bali and even got us discounted tickets! Afterwards, he was ready waiting for us early as usual (he's always a few minutes early which is comforting in a foreign country), but when we had issues with the ATM, he patiently waited for us and then drove us to pick up a quick lunch. On our last day, we had Gusti pick us up again in Canggu, with our 4 big suitcases and 4 smaller bags in his vehicle and he drove us to Kuta to spend our last afternoon. He dropped us off at the Hard Rock Cafe, and we were able to explore the beach and area and release van sea turtles while he kept our luggage in his car for the day! He picked us up in the later in the evening and finally drove us to the airport. We were all sad to say goodbye to our favorite personal guide and driver!! He is so sweet and helpful and you would definitely be happy to book Gusti and this company while enjoying your trip in Bali!! Thank you Gusti!!! <3"

            "review": "Amazing Afternoon, Average Morning.. The second part of this day tour was much more exciting and fun than the first part.Firstly, the driver was great. Very respectful of our privacy and was informative and educational when the time called for it. He picked us up from our hotel very promptly and was very happy, smiley and friendly throughout the whole day. I can\u2019t fault the service, both over email and once we were with our guide. There was no pressure of time and the amount of time spent at each attraction was very much up to us - which was great.The downsides:Before we set off we were given an itinerary which consisted of what you'll see on the website: Art Villages, Luwak Plantation, Rice Fields, Monkey Forest - Great! We were also told that, if there was time, we could go to see a traditional Balinese dance later in the day, which would be great if we were still interested in that after everything else.We set off and were immediately taken to see the dance/play/performance without being asked if we did actually went to see it. It was quite frustrating, but we rolled with it considering we were already there. However this came with an additional 100,000 Rupiah cost of entry, which we didn't sign up for or agree to! It was too late by that point and we sat through the hour-long performance which was ok. We came out with a decent-enough decorative plate/bowl with our picture on it.We then set off to go to the Art Village. The name is quite deceptive, as you imagine traditional markets/villages selling hand-crafted wares. What we weren't told is that they were two separate shops more than anything - far from a village - although they were hand-crafted.The first was a material/art shop, selling clothes, wicker decorations and some really beautiful paintings. The second was the silver shop which had some lovely pieces of jewellery and more paintings. The two were about a 20-30 min drive apart, so it took up a good couple of hours from the day.We were then asked if we wanted to go to a wood-carving shop, but we decided against that because we thought it would be more of the same. Very basic and brief \u201cdemonstrations\u201d of how items were made and straight into sales-heavy walk-arounds where shop assistants were pressing you to buy their stuff - despite much of it not being allowed into Australia. It seemed as though the drivers/companies were on some sort of commission for taking people there or people buying from there.It was around 5 hours after we left the hotel that we could get into the real good stuff and see the real sights of Ubud without feeling pressured into buying add-ons.The positives:Next up was the Luwak plantation. This was similar to the Art shops in which we were given a demonstration before taken into a shop and expected to buy, however it was a much more friendly and hands-on experience with lots of free add-ons. I\u2019ll write a separate review on that particular plantation on TripAdvisor if you wish to go to my profile and view it. There were no purchasing obligations with the Teba Sari plantation.The rice terrace was an amazing spectacle. Again, we had to pay - this time for parking rather than entry, which seemed strange as we could have just parked on the roadside for free. We were also blocked from going any further on the trail by a woman who demanded a \u201cdonation\u201d and a man who simply repeated \u201cmoney\u201d whilst I was taking photos. The views were breathtaking however, and it was a very nice walk that wasn\u2019t too taxing or exerting. Again, I\u2019ll do a separate review on the Tebalalang Rice Terrace.The pinnacle of the day was going to the Monkey Forest (again, separate review) and it was what we had been looking forward most to throughout the day. There was, again, an entry fee and you could pay for bananas to entice the monkeys to come and jump on you. We didn\u2019t pay, we just found a member of staff and asked him to help us, and he had nuts/berries of some sort to encourage the monkeys. We got some fantastic photos and had a great time.Dinner that evening was at a restaurant in Ubud. The name escapes me and I can\u2019t find any evidence of it online. It had an amazing view out the back, with lush paddies and a giant colourful statue of what I presume to be a God. The food was good - I had a Chinese-style beef dish. The smoke being blown over to our table by the two women from London on the table next to us wasn\u2019t particularly nice while we were eating (we later found out they were also staying at our hotel, so they got the best of our scathing stares). The staff were great and friendly and priced very reasonably.Overall:if you can, try and plan out your day before heading off, and make sure you only go to where you want, otherwise you\u2019ll find yourself paying more on entry fees, tips and other costs than the cost of the actual tour itself.The guide was great, unfortunately didn\u2019t catch his name, but he deserved the pretty large tip we gave him. From my perspective, try to miss out on the morning\u2019s dance/shopping if you don\u2019t want to pay on top of what you have to and get to do the better experiences sooner!"

We had a trek down to the river through the forest, which was so beautiful. The rafting was fun, in the dry season the water levels are much lower - so you don't go as fast and you can get stuck on rocks, we still had an awesome time, amazing views - we even saw a monkey on the other side of the River. The waterfalls are lovely, you can take your own pics standing under one, and wade around the river. Lunch was nice, buffet style - which was needed after the day of rafting! I would recommend this to people who like adventure and action, who don't mind exercise! - you do a lot of walking up and down stairs getting to and from the river (which we loved but other people did have trouble). Our tour guide was fantastic too - funny and informative - Thanks Sonic! All in all, a great day!"

We also booked the ferry to cross over to the Gilis with them, when their boat could not go they both went to extra mile to find us another boat (during the busiest season of the year). We cannot recommend them enough. They both hugely contributed to make our holidays perfect."

We then went on a tour to visit temples, restaurants etc and met a awesome tour guide named Gusti who quickly became part of the family. Gusti spoke great English and took us on a fantastic tour. Couldn't speak highly enough of Gusti, he made our bali experience a trip we will never forgot & we will be long time customers of bali sun tours because of Gustis's great customer service & fantastic knowledge. I'd also like to mention I am pregnant & Gusti always took his time to make sure I was doing okay and sat with me in the shade and kept me company when I couldn't walk any further. I really appreciated it and felt very safe with him next to me. Thank you thank you thank you!!!"

Super friendly from the second he met us at the airport. Each day he would always greet us with a smile and was always happy to chat with us and answer all of my partners questions about Bali, its culture and random things we drove past. He was even great about us wanting to add extra things to our itinerary or change things slightly. We did the Mt Batur Climb - this was a great morning despite the grueling climb in the dark. We watched the sun rise from the top of the mountain and then saw the volcano crater and where the monkeys live. Our guide was great, full of information!We also did the Monkey forest, at first i was excited and happy to see all of the monkeys. We had taken very little into the forest with us as it indicated they can try to take your things, all we had was cameras and a water bottle. They love the bottle and were jumping on us to try and take it. I had a baby monkey jump on me and chew on the bottle, which was cute, until the mother came up and started biting me coz she thought i was trying to steal her baby. Id recommend taking bare minimum into the forest, and staying away from the babies. Our final tour was the ATV adventure - this was a great day, although i had never ridden and ATV before and found it quite daunting at first. They give you a very quick run down of the controls and then send you on your way. The course is quite challenging if you don't know what you're doing. We had a lady ride off the edge of the path into a ditch within the first few minutes. I would recommend this if you have done ATVing before as a lot of the course if over a mud track and there are some quite challenging parts. I ended up sideways a few times.All in all Bali sun tours is a great company and i will definitely use them again if i return to bali :)"

Food was average, when we arrived back to the starting point for our buffet lunch, the buffet was almost empty and the remaining food was cold, it took a while to get a top up. But that was a minor negative.We also did an ATV tour, this was average. We did an atv tour on our last bali trip with a different company and were looking forward to this ne as it was a bit more extreme. We were disappointed in the group size (16 people) was far too many especially when alot of people had never ridden an ATV let alone seen one before... withon 5 minutes of the group leaving a girl drove off a bank and rooled her atv.... for the rest of the tour we continuusly had to stop and wait for her and her friend to catch up... this effeced ur time and experience. the bikes also kepot stalling and let out lots of fumes, not nice to be stuck behind that breathing it in.This tour indicates it is fine for beginners, i disgree. Alot of the track was mud and we slid around alot without any control. You drive along a small path with a metre drop to the side, one slip and you would be down the bank. I wouldnt reccommed this tour to anyone who has never ridden an atv, without the understanding how heavy they are and dangerous it can be if you crash or do not know how to steer, break, accerate or change gears, id reccommend the tour we did last year along the beach....."

We had choices that included seeing rice paddies, temples, monkey forest, silver making, batik, spice gardens and the Kopi Luwak coffee process (which I don't recommend because it mistreats Civet cats). We elected to check out the monkey forest (very cool), and asked our driver to take us for the best shopping for silver, batik and furniture...we scored! We also had a wonderful late lunch at an old plantation estate that our driver recommended and not the usual tourist attraction. Well worth the deal!"

As we were unsure of our Villa address, Surya Agung suggested we contact him when we arrived and he would meet us at our villa at our convenience, which he did. That's service for you!! We were a large group & Surya was able to organised & accommodate all our needs, which was no easy feat, believe me. We decided on the Eat Pray Tour, Sunset Tour, River Rafting, Seawalk & a Village tour, all of which we thoroughly enjoyed & would recommend. Our tour guides at different times, due our large group, where Gus, Nyoman, Putu & Tude, they are an awesome group of guys who are all very professional, extremely courteous & great drivers with clean, airconditioned cars. They all speak English & their knowledge of Bali is very informative, they even suggested at times we visit other sights on our tours, nothing was ever to much trouble.

Traffic in Bali is haphazard -- at best -- with a set of 'road rules' all their own, but we negotiated all moving obstacles with ease and complete safety, thanks to YOGA'S skill behind the wheel. Not only was YOGA very courteous, and fun to be with, but he cracked as many jokes as we did -- his English language skills were near perfect. Apart from knowing \"all the good places to go to\", he never once forced us into any particular establishment, instead, allowing us to choose where and when to stop. Another 'plus' was the fact that he never once even alluded to expecting more money -- as some do -- and this allowed us to enjoy our days with him, without feeling any pressure for 'the poor, underpaid, driver. (In fact, we have no idea what his wage may have been, as it never came up in conversation.) We can thoroughly recommend YOGA from Bali Sun Tours when you are in need of a driver in Bali, and contact him on yoga7335@gmail.com or info@balisuntours.comfrom 'Mr. John' and 'Mr. Des'."

We got picked up promptly from our hotel, and as soon as we got into the car he tried to sell us a fire show. We politely declined but thanked him for the offer.Our first stop was the King's Palace in Ubud. The drive was around 1hr 45mins. It was a lot smaller than I imagined, so we checked out the markets there, much more arty than the markets in Kuta!The tour boasted a suckling pig & buffet for lunch, which I was looking forward to, but for that, we would have to stay in Ubud, and since it was 10.20am, we were not ready for lunch. Our driver then said there was another option for a buffet lunch, without the suckling pig, we opted for that so it would be a better time for lunch.I wish we hadn't, the other option was overlooking Kintamani Volcano & Lake Butar. The view is absolutely stunning but the food - terrible. It was inandated by flies and did not look hygienic at all. My friend & I had to hunt for a clean looking plate and served ourselves a small helping of fried noodles & some funny looking chicken. We felt a bit ill afterwards.After lunch we got some more photos of the lake and had a browse of the street markets there. Then we headed to our coffee tasting! It was the best part of the tour, we got a tour of the plantation, and saw the process of the coffee making. The lady who worked there did a terrific job of this. We then got to have a complimentary tea & coffee taste, there were about 7 different flavours, and they were all so good! We had to pay 50,000rp (5AUD) for the coffe that's been passed through the Civet, but it's well worth it. Very lovely!A short drive later and we were at the Holy Springs. Our driver came in with us and I'm glad he did, he helped explain a lot of things, and let us know when we could take photos and when to put on sarongs ect. They provide sarongs before you enter the Springs for respect, which was handy. It was a great experience! Be aware, there is a fee to use the bathroom 2000rp (.20cents) and you will need your own toilet paper. After you exit the Holy Springs, there is a maze of markets! And to be honest, it's MUCH cheaper than Kuta markets! The ride home was long, and left the both of us feeling travel sick. I think the food we are also had something to do with it. It was good to have a cultural day, and that's what this tour does!"

I was feeling sick the night before our booked tour so I wrote to them wanting to change our tour to some other day and they had no problem doing that. Plus, we requested to drop us off at a different hotel in a different town. This was totally fine with them without extra charge.We had a wonderful time with our tour guide Made, his friendly, cheerful explanations of the culture surrounding everything we saw and experienced, gave us a very relax and enjoyable journey. So we booked him for an extra tour. We highly commend Bali Sun Tours and Made to be your guide in Bali. Thank you very much."

            "review": "Great Daytrips. We took 2 tours with Bali Sun Tours - an Ubud daytrip and a Sunset Tour to Uluwatu Temple & Jimbaran Bay. On both occasions we were collected from our resort punctually at the nominated time by courteous drivers in clean, late-model air-conditioned vehicles.The highlight of the Ubud trip was the tea/coffee tasting at the Ubud Luwak coffee plantation that only a local would be able to find. Our driver had earlier taken us to a Barong Dance which happens every morning at 9.30, costs A$10pp and was interesting, but a tad long (1 hour). Yoga, our driver, saw that I'd spotted a Ralph Lauren Polo outlet & happily took us there as well as to a silver factory. The Bali Sun Tour drivers will take you wherever you want to go but if there are parking costs or admission charges, they're your own responsibility.The Sunset Tour was beautiful & climbing the clifftop path to Uluwatu Temple was spectacular. There was a traditional Kecak Fire Dance on offer for A$10pp but we preferred to enjoy the view rather than taking in another hour-long dance performance. Be prepared to pay incidentals like temple admission/sarong hire at Uluwatu plus parking costs when you go to Jimbaran Bay. Dinner at Jimbaran Bay is delightful, dining under the stars enjoying fresh seafood before returning to your accommodation. Check out what restaurants along the strip have on offer (dinner is your own expense).Well done Bali Sun Tours for having so many itineraries on offer & such knowledgable local drivers."

Having heard mixed reviews of Bali - we were impressed with what we experienced with our host Oka.We used Oka for ~6 days during our 9 day stay. Oka stayed with us during the tour and explained all aspects of Balinese culture in great detail with great knowledge of Ubud and neighbouring villages.We started our tour on Friday morning with visit to Sea walk, Flying fish, Jimbaran Bay, Coffee Luwak and Dreamland beach. With plenty of time to enjoy each activity.Saturday and Sunday we had half days due to weather and hotel transfer. Oka was very accomodating and even agreed to enjoy a crazy rain bath at Tanah Lot Temple with us! The two halfdays we covered Tana Lot Temple and another beautiful temple close-by. Sarong factory and silver factory was done during our transfer to Ubud Villa with Oka.Across the next few days we enjoyed - Warung Dance, Sarong Factory, Ubud Locals Market, Monkey Forest, Rice Terrace, Volcano Walk, Temple and Water Blessings, Goa Gajah Cave saving best for last - the White Water Rafting with Oka's cousin Ary. What a fantastic bloke. Down to earth and also very understanding as my wife couldnt swim and it was our first rafting experience. Action packed and not to mention the wonderful foods we tried. Hands down to our host and the wonderful Bslinese locals for making this trip memorable. Thank you Oka, Ary and Bali Sun Tours!"

It was truly awesome. The next tour was to Nusa Dua, Blue Point, Ulawatu, and finished at Jimbaran Bay. Chilling at the beach was cool and very relaxing, we did some water sports (barter, you can usually get for half advertised price). Nothing was too much trouble for Oka. His English is great and he was always up for a chat about his life and Bali culture. His car (7 seater) was clean, fresh and had good air conditioning! All tolls and parking fees were covered by him. We also used him for transport to and from the airport. Such a fun time with a great guy.

We enjoyed his company so much that we booked him again the next day to go to Ubud, of which he was so helpful and took us to see the Luwak Kopi, Barong dance and explore the rice fields. I have been around other parts of Asia (Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, Indonesia etc) , But I have never met such a welcoming, honest and fun host.

From the first contact I had by email enquiring and booking our tours the service was very friendly and professional, I was made to feel as if I was part of the family.Our tour guide Nyoman arrived at our Resort with a large smile and from then on we felt as if we had known each other for ages.We had booked 2 tours on 2 separate days, both were wonderful from the beautiful scenery in Ubud to walking on the bottom of the ocean amongst the coral and the colourful fish.I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Bali Sun Tours where you can enjoy riding in the airconditioned van and take in all that there is to offer in Bali."

A few days before our travels they got in touch with us to re-confirm the times, dates and nature of the tours. We had two different drivers and both were beyond friendly and helpful and we had a great time with them! It is such a great way to get around and see and more of the country and nature and learn more about the island. You could easily spend a whole day visiting places and exploring the area. 10/10 would do again!!"

We were picked up at 11am at our hotel in Seminyak and drove around 1.5 hours to the location. We got changed into our swimmers and put our life jackets/helmets on, picked up an oar and off we went down to the river. NOTE: the trip down is very steep and slippery, care needs to be taken.Our guide, Made, was great - so funny and controlled the raft really well and had good English and instructed us well. We travelled for 5km through the rapids where we stopped to go swimming, grab a drink, and jump off rocks into the river (if you were game!) then travelled another 5km to the finish point. As we reached the finish point, we jumped out of the raft and swam the final 50m. We walked up to the restaurant where we had showers and got changed and had lunch.We were then driven back to our hotel.It was a well organised and fun day! We took a camera in a plastic bag and they provided us with a water proof bag to place it in. We suggest having a change of clothes for the end.Our guide, Made, went out of his way to make our trip enjoyable and fun!!!Highly recommended!!"

The staff at the rafting entrance were so helpful and advised us what we needed for the tour (neither of us had done rafting before). Apart from the buzz of the rapids & the amazing scenery, our guide made the experience so much fun, laughing & joking with us the whole time (my teenage daughter thought he was very \"upbeat\"). Lunch was lovely with equally pleasing views from the restaurant over rice fields (although the walk from the river partly along the road was a bit hairy). Fresh towels were handed out and a shower was offered too. The trip back to the Hotel was equally as comfortable and we were able to leave when we were ready. I would highly recommend this tour for anyone visiting Bali - an experience to remember. Don't forget a plastic bag to put your valuables in while your in the raft. Thank you Bali Sun Tours.

Oka speaks great english and had a wonderful sense of humour which filled in the long drives between desinations. As we had not been to Bali before we left the tour up to Oka and he first took us to a local weaving and textiles factorie, then a silver jeweler, then onto the volcano where we had a buffett lunch (not so great) after that he took us to the rice terrace, which was beautiful and onto a coffee farm where we would taste the famous \"cat-poo-chino\" as Oka called it !!! We enjoyed our day so much we booked Oka to pick us up a few day later to look at a few temples and do some shopping, and we finished the day watching the sun set at a sea food restaurant in Jambarung, which was just spectacular and a fantastic way to finish off our time in Bali."

We asked to be picked up and dropped off at another hotel and nothing was too much trouble at all. We had fun along the way although I felt bad for our driver Nyoman or we called him Norman as he had to answer all my mums questions about Bali and the 3 little boys in the back of the car. He took us anywhere we wanted him to although we had booked the romantic tour. I knew we wouldn't enjoy the temple so as we requested he didn't take us there. He found us a lovely place for lunch which we visited another 3 times. We asked if he cow;d drop us off early so the kids could get home to the pool and it was only smiles. The water sports was pretty full on with lots of people but we enjoyed the sea walker and got it for the group on price of $49 each. The guy there was good as he wasn't pushy at all, they understood that we had 3 little kids under 5 so hard to do it all. I would recommend this tour to anyone. Its also a great way to get transferred as there is that time that you are in no mans land."

Picked us up at mid night from the airport no worries (even had the sign with our name on it). Was friendly and polite straight away, shoed away the pesky taxi drivers trying to take advantage of you when you first come out the doors of the airport..Over the course of ten days we used him prob 5 of those days on and off, he was sooo easy to deal with, very knowledgeable of places to go or places not to go. nothing was ever to much trouble everything is always 'ok' with Oka!he is happy to wait around for you to finish dinner or whatever it is you are doing.. or if you invite him in for a beer or dinner will normally happily pull up a seat and have a chat!MAKE SURE you get Oka to take you to where the \"locals eat\" its called a Warung. omg some of the best food you will ever eat... each one specialises in different things depending on what part of Bali you are in and he knows the best ones and you won't get sick!! Suckling pig mmmmmmm.i could go on for ever here but i will cut it short all in all Oka really made our holiday AMAZING with out him i feel we would have had the amazing cultural experience we did. THANK YOU OKA xx"

I continuously asked my Guide Nyoman heaps of questions and he was only to happy to share with me his knowledge of Bali and its culture. I felt safe at all times and I don't think i would have got the same experience if I had of hired a random driver to drive me around. Its the little thinks like letting me know how to behave around monkeys and which hand to use for purification. Its always hard for someone who wants to respect another culture to feel comfortable because you worry so much about making mistakes...but i felt fine. I went on the Luminous tour and the Ubud Tour. The Barong dance was cool, the temples were amazing and I loved the restaurant at the volcano. The food was lovely and so inexpensive. The next trip we went to the monkey forest and to Ubud and we also looked at the process of making Batik...Its my first time to Bali so Nyoman helped me to understand local custom and that's what i'm there for to learn.....so Wow and that's all i can say. Totes recommend. Do take a camera, sunblock, water and a hat and be prepared to be amazed"

We also did the cooking class the dolphin swim and a tour of ubed. The owner of bali sun tours is fantastic he comes to your villa and collects your money at a time the works for you and he answers his emails very quickly of you want to change the time.Also if you plan to do the dolphin swim book it through bali sun tours as lots of people who try and book through the dolphin company get messed around. We just asked Suriya the owner of bali sun tours to book it he made a quick phone call and it was done. We were picked up and dropped off for no additional cost.I would recommend bali sun tours if you are traveling to bali particularly if it is your first trip he is trustworthy and easy to deal with."

The length of this tour (about 5 hours) suited both the older and younger people in our group. Surya kindly arranged this tour for us on short notice and Wayan was our guide. He was very friendly and provided us with some basic background information. This tour included a visit to Uluwatu temple (which included a kecak dance performance) and dinner on the beach at Ganesh Cafe (Seafood restaurant), Jimbaran. The location of the temple (on a cliff) was amazing! The temple itself was closed off to tourists so we walked around the temple grounds (not very large) took pictures of the astounding views and monkeys. Be sure to keep your belongings in your vehicle if possible (sunglasses etc.) as these monkeys take whatever they can, edible or not. We saw one with a coin purse it had pinched from a fellow tourist!The view from the outdoor theatre overlooking the ocean was breathtaking. We were told that on a less cloudy day, we would have had a better view of the sun setting. We paid a little less than USD 10 for each adult (half price for kids) to watch the kecak dance (this is in addition to the $2 we paid to enter the temple grounds). The kecak dance started off on a serious note and quickly became farcical after the second act. The kecak chorus was quite unusual and kept the show moving along. After the show ended, we made our way to Jimbaran for dinner. If you feel cold with wind blowing, do bring along a light jacket/sweater so you can comfortably enjoy dinner on the beach. The ordering process was a bit chaotic. The red snapper we ordered (sweet sour style) was tasty. The rest of it was average. The seafood fried rice was cold when it arrived and the prawns were over-cooked. I wouldn't opt go back to this restaurant even though the fish was quite good. Wayan was great! I hope to take another tour with Bali Sun Tours when I return to Bali."

Luckily I had sat near the window so I could clearly what is outside. A young guide started to tell us about animals living there. I felt amazed seeing three zebras coming near to our bus. Then, we see rhinoceros, a sunbathing hippopotamus lol, tigers, and other wildlife creatures that have their uniqueness. \u201cWe are no longer in Bali, here is Africa\u201d my friend joked.

My partner and I went overseas for the first time to bali in December and we absolutely loved going through Bali Sun Tours for all our activities we planned to do. All members of the team were lovely and made you feel comfortable and at home in Bali, Surya helped me to organize and pre plan some of our activities before we went via email and facebook and always messaged me to offer assistance to make our trip the best it could be. He gave us good deals on everything we did and every single activity we did ran smoothly. The one time we booked NOT through Bali Sun Tours was the one thing we didnt like, so continued to book through their company. MY friends who were in bali at the same time as us were booking through the street stalls everyone back home tells you to book at and they were being ripped off on comparison to us, and said their tours were no where near as good as ours. Surya is an excellent host for Bali, so cheerful and genuinely wanting to provide the best for all his customers. I couldnt recommenced bali sun tours more, making sure my friends and my parents who come to Bali this year go through this company!!!"

I had so much fun with my friends doing rafting at Telaga Waja River. When I was there, I felt like I found the secret beauty of Bali. The forest was so thick and green with vines hanging down the tall trees, falling leaves, bird chirping, total opposite of all the crowd and the buzz in US. The price was reasonable and I had a river guide who was the very definition of friendliness with an air of professionalism in his every rafting advices and guidelines. He provided us with waterproof bag and towel too. The safety equipment was international standardized, added with insurance cover hence I could put my worries aside. We ended the day with tasty buffet. We went back to our hotel completely merry for we tamed the wild dragon on the best river in Bali! Thank you Bali Sun Tours!!!"

We did parasailing, banana boat, and jet ski. I wanted to do snorkeling at first, but the staff advised me not to because they were worried of my health, so I agreed with activities that did not include submerging myself under water. I was really thankful for the advice, if not I wouldn't be able to enjoy the last 3 days. Thank you for caring, Bali Sun Tour, I really appreciated it.The parasailing was so much fun, when I was on the sky I saw the beauty of Bali, the vast blue ocean surrounding the brown sandy shore, that was a breath-taking view to take. The blazing sun was a nice compliment for the chilling ocean breeze so I was comfortable up there. It seemed that Bali Sun Tours chose the right time to be that high. That was awesome and really thoughtful!The banana boat and jet ski were enjoyable. The instructor explained how to drive the jet ski very clearly and even tested us whether we understood his explanation or not, a detail man with detail explanation. 3 hours on the beach was not enough because Bali Sun Tours made our holiday so enjoyable. The staffs were so helpful too right from the very beginning when we were scheduling up to when the driver took us back to my hotel.Bali Sun Tours gave me a marvelous holiday in Bali. Fantastic holiday agent! Please help with my next trip too!"

Within minutes I received an email back with a price $15 cheaper than my resort quoted, so we confirmed the booking, the driver would pick us up from Seminyak at 9am. It was pouring rain, the driver was early and greeted us with an umbrella so we didn't get wet. He introduced himself as Made.We got in the very comfy A/C van and explained we didn't really know where to go for shopping, so we'll leave it to him. Made suggested quite a few places including Geneva, matahari, kuta art market, discovery, and took us to quite a few others along the way and also took us for lunch @ Bubba Gumps. Nothing was at all to much trouble, being pregnant, I wanted to look at baby stuff, Made even walked me to the baby sections of the department stores to show me !Made was obliging, courteous and his English was 10/10. He also took us to a bank to exchange money along the way.....bringing us back to our villa at 4.30 via Seminyak square to pick up some dresses that I had made a few days earlier to accommodate my expanding belly.I would recommend this driver to anyone visiting Bali, he certainly looked after us!

And I\u2019m incredibly glad that I did! The team at Amansuka was incredibly accommodating of my last minute request for a day tour. I ended up booking the Traditional Morning Market, Historical Temple, and Volcano Tour and was lucky to have Wayan Arjana as my driver/guide for the day. From the first minute to the very last, Wayan shared stories about his culture, daily life as a Balinese, and the history and significance of each of the places we visited. There was never a dull moment, as he fielded all my questions with great detail.Even the smallest considerations like preparing a cold hand towel to refresh after each stop, providing sarongs for temple visits, taking the side streets to avoid traffic, and haggling with the coconut man to get the local price were very thoughtful and greatly appreciated.It was a long day (we visited 9 places total!), and Wayan remained engaged the whole time. It was great to see so much of Bali, and these sights were greatly enhanced by the extra context Wayan provided.This was without a doubt the best day tour I\u2019ve ever been on. If you\u2019re looking for a professional, friendly, and engaged guide with heaps of knowledge about Bali and its beautiful culture, I highly recommend booking a trip with Amansuka. Thanks so much Wayan Arjana for a wonderful day, and I look forward to recommending your services to all my friends and family!"

We went to a few places including Uluwatu Temple where he provided sarongs and found us a a good location to enjoy the sunset.Despite the long hours on road, it was a very comfortable ride as he drives really well and has great familiarity with roads thus able to avoid the traffic jams by navigating through the smaller roads.We are extremely pleased with Amansuka Tour and would highly recommend them to anyone visiting Bali."

            "review": "2 Tours in 4 days! We will only tour with Amansuka. Amansuka Tours is the best tour company we have come across in Bali. We were ripped off by another company, so we really appreciated Amansuka Tours for their hard work and honesty.We booked a custom tour on the Wednesday afternoon, we flew in and Wayan picked us up from the hotel at 2.30 in Legian and took us to the Uluwatu temple, it was such a stunning site, Wayan is extremely knowledgeable about the area, history and pointed things out to us along the way, on the way back he stopped at a shopping centre for us because we had forgotten toothpaste and some other essential items. We were supposed to go to a restaurant at 7:00 pm but we were so tired Wayan took us back to the hotel. We were very happy with our custom tour that Wayan was able to fit into our afternoon.On the Friday we picked the Singaraja 'Lovina' Tour. If you only have 1 free tour day in Bali make it this tour!!! We went to the Ulun duna Temple which was just breath taking it was 50,000IDR each to get in, which I though was a bit expensive, until we go inside it was worth every cent. The grounds and temple are just one of kind, the mountains by the lake are just stunning. We were also lucky enough that there was a Hindu ceremony happening at the same time so Wayan was able to explain a lot of that to us. We also went to the Gitgit waterfalls, Lovina Beach, the Twin Lakes (it's cold up there take a jumper or cardigan), the hot springs and the Buddhist Temple. We saw so much of Bali and different ways of life of people. We were surprised when we were cold up at the Twin Lakes and stopped for coffee and a fried banana.Wayan personally, has a very friendly manner, he is approachable and easy to talk to, we didn't feel uncomfortable asking him questions or joking with him. Being in a car for 12 hours I think it's important you can relax and relate to the person you are with.Amansuka is a family company, I think it shows, the effort and personal touches Wayan put into our tour were above and beyond what we received from other tours and drivers during our stay in Bali.We already want to come back and do more tours with Wayan."

The email exchange was a little pushy, he kept trying to add other things, but since the reviews were so good we booked two day tours anyway. Wayan was a good tour guide, he spoke great English and was amiable to however much time we wanted to spend taking pictures. Tanah Lot itself was incredibly crowded and touristy - not the tour guide's fault - just a heads up. Although we enjoyed ourselves a great deal, we ended up paying entrance fees in the sum of something like $50 total for every place we went to. Now, the confirmation email he sent did say that entrance \"fee\" was not included, but it didn't specify what those fees were. Plus, the fees for Tanah Lot had been recently increased. Luckily, we had enough money to pay for everything but it was super shady not to be upfront about that kind of thing, especially when people are usually traveling on a budget. We cancelled our second day trip because of the additional costs. I don't mind paying for things as long as I have a heads up I have to pay for them. If you book with them, ask for a thorough price list."

It was great to have a private guide who was more than willing to tailor an adventure to our specific needs. Nothing was too much for you. Your service for the day (a full 8 hrs) was very reasonably priced and worth every cent. You made us feel welcomed and honored in your country and we loved spending the day with you.The next day we hired you again and your brother drove us to our whitewater rafting tour. This was sooo much fun - Thank you for organising it all for us!!! He is just as funny as you and we felt safe secure knowing it was through your company that we had organised our tour.Thank you so much - you made our trip amazing!"

Wayan is a very spiritual man, and taught my husband and I so much about the Balinese way of life. We are newlyweds, and he gave us the most beautiful advice to help build a strong foundation for our marriage. We felt like we were spiritually counseled, and could talk to him all day. Wayan is passionate about his family owned and operated business, and he truly cares about his guests. He is a wealth of knowledge and taught us so much. We started the day at a traditional Balinese home, then went to the Tengugan waterfall, followed by the Tagalalalong rice fields, lunch overlooking the volcano, then to my favorite part of the day: Tirta Empul temple, where we purified ourselves with holy water. We finished the day at the Gunung Kawi temple, and then he dropped us off at our hotel. Sean and I have used drivers throughout our time in Indonesia, and nothing compares to Wayan's services. He stayed with us the entire time, and educated us about all of the places we visited. It was so interesting and amazing to hear the history behind it all. He also structured our day in the best way possible to avoid crowds, which was so amazing. Wayan is an awesome driver, and navigates the Balinese roads with ease. He has a great car, and it is extremely comfortable. I am so happy we choose to spend our day with Wayan. He is a great person, and now friend."

As a first time Bali visitor, Wayan was really good about making us comfortable, from the prompt Denpasar airport pick-up to the making of excursion deals for us so we got the local price and making of spa appointments. His English is very easy to understand. He flavored the tour of the temples/countryside with Balinese culture/wisdom, which we requested and appreciated. He provided sarongs whenever temple dress was mandated and he had umbrellas on standby for the afternoon rains. He was aware of issues we might have with Bali food (\"Bali belly\" is a problem for westerners sometimes) and pointed us to eateries that would be safe. His driving tours seem to be based out of Ubud, so he is really good for seeing mountain scenery, rice terraces, and temples in central to North Bali. He has a lot of local connections and recommendations, so helped us to get into the #2 cooking class in Ubud (recommended for its small class size). He also helped us to get a rafting excursion for half of the list price. Coming from a Northern climate and not being acclimated to tropical climate, it made a huge difference to always have an air conditioned car waiting for us so we could really enjoy each day. Highly recommend!"

Unfortunately we got stuck in Taiwan in a monsoon and had to reschedule, and he responded right away and we were able to do it the next day! The first day, Wayan's brother Made was our guide since Wayan was booked. He was an amazing guide and taught us so much as we traveled to rice fields, waterfalls, lake temple and lunch! He was such a joy to be with all day and really took time to teach us about their culture and what is important to them in life.We enjoyed our tour so much that we booked the next day for a quicker tour and a drop off at our next location in Nusa Dua! We had the pleasure of finally meeting Wayan who was truly amazing. He also took so much time to talk to us about life and he strived to be a good person and really taught us a lot about how we should all look at life. It was extremely therapeutic, especially starting our new life together as husband and wife. He honestly cared about us and wanted to make sure we have a happy and healthy marriage. These brothers are simply the best! Their nephew is also a guide for the company and we can only imagine that he is just as wonderful! You will be so lucky to have any of them as your guides!

He worked with our scheduling issues, and ended up providing a tour and transfer between Legian and Ubud. What is important to note first is that he's a great guy. You're essentially spending a day trapped in a car with a stranger on those Balinese roads (ohhhhh those Bali roads). He's very nice, he's funny, and he's personable. It was like we were touring with a friend. He would translate interesting conversations going on around us, and some of them were quite entertaining!Having scoured TripAdvisor prior to our departure, I had a list of things I wanted to see (and no idea whether that list was reasonable or realistic). Wayan took a look at the list, and offered suggestions for a more reasonable itinerary. What resulted was a great tour of the central part of the island, from the southern coast to Lake Beratan, and back to Ubud. Wayan was right on time picking us up from our Legian hotel, greeted us at 0830 with a smile, and helped load our luggage into his van. Throughout the tour, we peppered him with questions about Balinese life, culture, politics, and essentially any information you might ask. He was so incredibly knowledgeable (and delicately pointed out any misinformation we were fed earlier in our trip). We learned SO much about Bali with him!In sum, I cannot recommend Wayan enough. Had we more time in Ubud, we would have absolutely booked several days with him and toured more of the country. Go! And enjoy!"

Very humble and a wealth of knowledge!! We were able to see so many things and learn about the culture while viewing 8th century temples!!!

Anyway, I was assigned Wayan's brother as my guide (I forgot his name). He was at the airport when I arrived. Before the tour, Wayan provided 2 lists of itineraries from where I can choose from, so I did and tell my guide what I wanted, he was kind, but it kinda felt like i was on an unprepared tour. One of the sites we visited was Besakih, he told me that if I'm lucky he will be accompanying me inside the temple and that I dont have to pay for a guide, it confused me all of a sudden why he would say that and insisted that he come with me inside. He did, after insisting twice. I paid almost a hundred dollars for this tour but I thought that I didn't get what I paid for."

I would really recommend this reliable company when you want to see several hotspots in bali and also learn a great deal about balinese life and culture!"

I had a one day tour in Ubud which started at 8 in the morning. Wayan picked me up from Sanur and I was back at the hotel by 6:30 in the evening. Wayan was really knowledgeable about the Balinese culture and answered all of my questions. He was generous to offer to take photos of me and knew great spots where I could take them. My tour was customized as I gave a list of the places that I wanted to see in Ubud and Wayan accommodated all of them except for one which was out of the way. I would definitely recommend Amansuka Tour to anyone visiting Bali and would make sure to contact them again when I am back."

From shuttling us between towns or taking us on a custom day tour of the sights of Ubud, Wayan was very professional, timely and knowledgeable. My friends that travelled with me had a 2 yr old son, and Wayan was able to provide a baby seat for them as well.I would highly recommend Wayan and his tour company. His rates are very reasonable and he also has a huge passion for anything and everything Balinese. All of our questions were answered happily and Wayan was always eager to speak about his culture.Thank you Wayan and your family for such great service while we visited your beautiful country. I can't wait to go back!! See you again I'm sure!!"

This pretty much became a custom made tour. Nyoman made some good suggestions. Firstly we stopped at the butterfly sanctuary which was really nice and held a large collection of colourful butterflies. Then off to the nearby waterfall, sorry can't remember the name but it's close to the butterfly sanctuary. Wow, the waterfall was running well and the opportunity to swim was available, so take your bathers. There were warungs and souvenir stalls at the waterfall if you get hungry or want to shop. Next stop was for Lewak coffee and herbal tea tastings at Taman Ayu where they make the products.This was set in a jungle setting overlooking an old temple. Relaxing location where we sampled the coffee and teas which were really good. Next stop Tanah Lot for the sunset. Hundreds and hundreds of tourists rolling up on big tourist buses. This took the ambiance away to say the least but it was good to see the temple.Then we went to Melasti restaurant for our seafood dinner. This restaurant overlooks the ocean and temple and is outdoors. This was a mistake as everything we ate was bad. Aside from this we had a really enjoyable day with Nyoman. Nyoman was such a pleasant, kind and courteous man with a good sense of humour. We got to know him over the afternoon. We learned about his family and his life which was good to hear about. Nothing was too much trouble for him. If you pick a tour to Tanah Lot best not to eat there or Google restaurant reviews before selecting a restaurant. Thank you Nyoman for an enjoyable tour, we enjoyed your company very much :-)"

He has an immaculately clean and comfortable car, and drives carefully. At no time were we concerned for our well being or safety. He is prompt, courteous, and professional. Our communication was through email until our arrival to Indonesia. We always received quick responses to any messages we sent.We had planned a short visit to Bali, so as first time visitors, we wanted to see as much as possible. We decided a private guided tour would be ideal. We couldn't have asked for a better guide. I chose Suka through reviews I read on TripAdvisor. Suka helped us to customize our itinerary based on our interests. We covered the Central Mountain region part of the East Coast. He explained so much about Balinese culture and people. We saw many examples of daily life and the beautiful countryside. We were able to avoid a lot of the heavily visited sites. We spent approximately 9-10 hours each day touring. That is a long day of driving, but Suka did not seem to mind.When I return to Bali, I will seek out Amansuka Tour for services. I will also recommend him to anyone searching for a guide or driver. We couldn't be more pleased with our first stay in Bali."

We thoroughly enjoyed our 2 days with Wayan Suka and Wayan Eka, both very professional safe drivers who also pride their business on being guides not just drivers. This makes them a step up to the average driver which is much more enjoyable. They gave us an interesting insight into the Balinese way of life as they skilfully drove through the bustling market places and quiet country laneways of Bali. I have visited Bali 4 times before and have learnt so much more this time than previous visits. At each attraction they went out of their way to show us the best areas, take photos for us, suggest the best places to have lunch, but never tried to talk us into seeing something we didn't want to see as many other drivers do. Wayan Eka took us to his family temple where we were lucky enough to meet his mother and share a cup of coffee with his family and friends. This was a very special time which we will never forget. We won't hesitate to use these guides next time we are in Bali and I have already recommended them to my friends who will be visiting in December. Thank you Wayan and Wayan for making our visit to Bali such a memorable one.Cathy, Liz and Trish from Australia"

On the first occasion, i incorporated a transfer from Seminyak to Ubud while exploring some temples and other local attractions like rice fields,; the next occasion was a whole day tour and the last was a transfer from Ubud back to Bali airport.What impressed me was the level of flexibility my driver (Wayan's nephew) had in my itinerary. After weeks of emailing and discussing with Wayan (Uncle) a tour itinerary I had to make a last minute change: I was meant to have got to Uluwatu the day before on my own but due to bad weather i didn't go. I told Wayan (nephew) on the first day of my tour and he handled this with upmost professionalism. He did not question my decision at all. So I knew from that point, their focus is on the customer. In addition to this, I did not have to wait in the lobby of my hotel for them- like when they say they will be there at a certain time, they will be there!Wayan my driver/guide was a gracious and funny host where we joked around and laughed during my tour. However, it was disappointing that Wayan could not drop me off to the airport as i wanted to properly thank him for an amazing time i had with him.What i truly liked about this tour company is that its a small family run business, where the money goes back to the driver and their village. We, from a western culture need to support such companies and give back to those that survive on our tourist dollars! Their prices were very competitive with other tour comanies in Bali and would happily recommend them to TA readers. I would most certainly use them again without a doubt!"

First, we were late to the hotel for our pickup that I had made weeks prior and just confirmed the day before (batik class took much longer than expected and there was a lot of traffic due to a parade). We rushed in the hotel for a very calm man to be waiting, telling us it would be fine, that he would wait even longer for us to go to our room and use the bathroom and such. Much appreciated! Well, my daughter got a little case of the \"Bali Belly\" I just couldn't put her in the car for an entire afternoon not feeling well. As I am a single parent and was tending to her, I called the front desk and asked them to tell our driver we needed to cancel and that I would not be returning. Later (almost an hour later) I went to the front desk to ask a question. He was still there!! The front desk never told him!! After getting very upset and making a scene in the lobby insisting the front desk apologize to this man...he remained so calm. He told me outside that it was ok, this was common with this hotel, that he understood and to go be with my daughter. As horrible as I felt for being late, cancelling and then unknowingly keeping him waiting...he was still so calm and kind to me. This says so much about a persons character. I recommend this company based on this and feel that if you are able to use them, you will be well taken care of. Amansuka, thank you so much for understanding."

Despite the price being for a 9am-6pm tour, it was nearing on 7pm by the time we got back as Wayan Jr took a detour to the Luwak coffee farm with no hesitation! What also helped is that we were picked up from out hotel in Ubud in the morning, and then dropped off in Seminyak later in the day.In summary, an fantastic day with a fantastic guide that was completely tailored to you as a guest! 5 star easily!"

I've driven in Paris, but driving in Bali looks even more stressful! I could tell Suka is a sharp and careful driver though so I was able to nap peacefully on long drives. :) There is so much to learn about the culture and the history you don't want to miss so Suka's proficient English and deep Bali knowledge was great. We had 2 other drivers on the trip and the language barrier made it more difficult to get much info from them.But above all, I am glad we found a trustful person. He was responsive in correspondence and arrived on time. We had a 5 year old with us and he was so kind and attentive with him. He has great suggestions, but also laid back and flexible on plans too.

He never failed to make us comfortable throughout the whole trip, and worked diligently to make sure that we see the best of Bali. Unlike many other guides in Bali, he does not cut corners and would be the last person to bring you to a tourist trap. Amansuka is like a Balinese friend who's happy to show you his hometown, and his tours are also competitively priced (we even gave him a good tip for the fantastic tour).If you're arranging for a day tour in Bali, look no further.

Wayan, my tour guide, has such wonderful knowledge of the Balinese life, and touring with him really opens up your eyes to their culture, their way of life and their deep customs, rituals and traditions. Wayan' knowledge of the Balinese spirituality is incredibly profound and he was able to relate those ideas to us, completely alien to his culture and way of life, so so well.The entire tour, which he gladly brought us around ubud and its surrounding sights and temples for a good 10-11 hours, were deeply insightful. My friends and I came off the tour filled with so much knowledge, ideas and appreciation for Bali and her beautiful people and their way of life. And there is still so much to know, to learn, to explore. Amansuka's tour does not just broaden your horizons, it also broadens your world view, your mind, and finally, your heart.That is how special Amansuka's tour is to us. We will be back with Wayan again!"

We booked Amansuka for a 2 day tours and 2 way airport transfers- and all i can say is that they are your most diligent and knowledgable guides (Wayan and Made) in Bali! Wayan treats all his customers like old-time friends and that was apparent in that 2 days when we had our tours with him. My mom had a bad leg during the trip and he would think of alternative routes or places that would suit her better. We are also appreciative that he did not try to inject his ideas into the tour; instead he would constantly seek our opinions which made us very comfortable throughout the trip. I have included 2 photos which i took during the tours, one was taken in a restaurant (that serves awesome organic food) facing Mt Batur and another was the breathtaking Uluwatu Sunset.Made was our driver who drove us from our hotel in Ubud to the airport. To our surprise, he is not just a driver but also a guide in that 1.5hrs drive! He is someone with lots of positive energy and is very willing to share with us what he knows about Bali and even Indonesia as a whole!Look no further if you need a guide in Bali! :)"

We did the Uluwatu sunset tour while we were in seminyak and the rice terrace tour while we were in Ubud.For the rice terrace tour we had a driver named wayan who was very good, he took us to the butterfly park which was a great experience being able to hold newly born butterflies, rhino beetles and a praying mantis! We also went to the irrigation museum, saw a traditional Balinese home and went to Jutiluwih rice terrace where we got to see some farmers and buffalo farming the rice. Wayan showed us a local warung where we would try suckling pig, we had never tried it or eaten at a warung so that was a great experience.Wayan gave us a lot of information throughout the tour which was very helpful and he was great to chat to and made us feel very comfortable.Our flight had been delayed the night before so we had only slept for three hours before wayan picked us up. We kept falling asleep in his car and he was very considerate not to wake us up and even went and got the car for us after the walk in the rice terrace so that we didn't have to walk. Thank you so much for a great day wayan!!! Our second tour we had another driver named wayan who took us to GWK to see some amazing giant statues of Garuda and Vishnu, it was such a great experience and we really appreciate the information he provided about the Vishnu and how long the statue has taken to build. We also stopped at Padang Padang beach before heading to Uluwatu to watch the sunset. The views from Uluwatu temple were breathtaking and we got some great photos here, wayan knew the best spot for us to watch the sunset and took some photos for us.Wayan then took us to Jimbaran bay to a restaurant called 'new moon' for a seafood dinner.Thank you wayan, we enjoyed our tour!We would recommend Amansuka tours to anyone who would like to see something different and we liked that we could customize the tour based on what we wanted to see and how long we had. We look forward to seeing you on our next trip to Bali for some more tours!!"

Wayan who was our guide for the day and he was brilliant. We had some ideas of places to visit and left the rest up to him based on what we wanted to see and experience. Day one was to visit a couple of temples which where brilliant then somerice terraces, and typical Balinese home and family and general site seeing of this beautiful island. Considering we had Wayan for a full day the cost was exceptional for what we did. Day two was to go White Water rafting, which I have to say was brilliant and cannot wait to do this again. He organised transport to a local company and got us a great deal. Yes he probably will get commission but when you workout what you pay, a good half day rafting and a delicious lunch at the end you cannot complain. We would certainly recommend this tour company and a big thank you to Wayan for leaving a positive view of Bali and its people.My father and mother are coming over in Dec on the way to see my brothers in Australia and New Zealand and I'll be recommending this company to them.

Wayan is the owner of the company and served as our guide for two days in Bali. During the first day, he assisted our transfer from our hotel in East Bali to our hotel in Ubud. Wayan was very punctual and his vehicle is well maintained and comfortable. We wanted to combine the move between the hotels with a day tour of Balinese countryside. Wayan came up with several excellent suggestions for the trip. During our journey to Ubud, Wayan shared a lot of valuable and interesting information on Balinese life and culture. He's very knowledgeable and speaks excellent English. Because he's a licensed guide, we were able to save money at the Mother Temple in east Bali and avoid the need to negotiate with and hire local guides. On our second day, we visited The Sacred Monkey Forest, the butterfly par, several villages, and a Balinese home. Wayan is extremely friendly, helpful, flexible, and has a good sense of humor. His tours are custom tailored to the interests of the clients. We recommend him highly. You won't be disappointed. John and TatyanaJuly 2016"

After having made a lot of research to find the best guide in Bali, I decided to contact Wayan to show us the beauty of his island on 3 different days of our trip. I can confirm that he is an excellent guide, but out of the 3 days booked with him, we only had the pleasure to meet him during the first day of our Bali tours . On une 28th, a family member came to pick us up, as one of his relatives had passed away and he had to organize the funeral. We had also booked him for July 7th and he wasn't available because his son had a badminton tournament, so somebody from another company came to pick us up. From my experience during our Bali trip,4 out of 6 planned transportations were not done by the person we initially fixed the appointment with. They will always tell you ' yes I'm available ', but then it's the cousin of the brother or the nephew of the aunt that will come instead.To pay 60 USD for a day tour with someone who is exceptionally well quoted is fine, but if then you have to pay the same amount for somebody you didn't choose and with a service that is basically ok but far less professional than with Wayan himself is questionable."

He speaks excellent English and has the typical Balinese curiosity to him which makes it easy to learn more about Bali and it's culture. We had many interesting conversations with him in the car which made the time between stops feel very short. He also provides good suggestions on places to visit but you can of course decide yourself which places you want to visit. Unlike some other drivers-for-hire on Bali Amansuka would never take you to places where you feel obliged to buy something. On the contrary, he gives advice on how to avoid the many touts in tourist areas. Also, when going places of interest Amansuka will join and share his knowledge about the place rather than just wait by the car. If you are visiting a temple, he will provide you with the required sarong. The next day we booked Amansuka again to go to the airport. So you can also book him as airport transfer, if he is available of course he primarily do half day or full day tours. All in all we could not be happier with this service. The rates are extremely reasonable so if you are satisfied with the service I think he deserves a generous tip."

Aside from being a wonderful, skilled driver through the narrow, busy, scooter-filled roads and local backroads, Suka is a great teacher of Balinese culture and Hindu beliefs. Bali is gorgeous itself, but with Suka, Bali became alive and more personal. His English is excellent, making communication, conversations and questions easy. He helped explain the history and design of each of the numerous magnificent temples we visited and arranged the tour around our schedule, desires and needs. Suka even went out of his way to help us by stopping by the grocery store during our daily tours, and helped fill in our tours with suggested sites and highlights along the way to points we already wanted to see. His transport was roomy for the 5 of us, clean, cold AC for our daily drives around Bali. Rates are reasonable $50-60/day. Our 5 yr old son loved Suka and had a great time helping to grind coffee beans at a local agriculture farm stop. The most memorable part though, was a stop at a random local residence where Suka introduced us to the random family and to their open and welcoming lifestyle of Bali culture. Here Suka taught us the traditional layout of a Bali residence, how the extended family live together there, and the importance and incorporation the Hindu religion into the residence. It is no surprise that the other reviews for Suka are similar, and next time we visit, we will be sure to contact Suka again."

He answered my emails promptly, and he has a website with his various itineraries to give you ideas of what you can do, though he is more than ready to customise a tour to suit your needs. He told us he worked in a large tour company for several years before setting up this private tour company 8 years ago with his brother. His experience really shows in everything he does. He is calm and polite and has a great sense of humour. He's an excellent and safe driver and really knows his routes well. He answered every question we asked (religious, political, historical, agricultural, personal etc), and he shared with us the Balinese philosophy of life and its religion. He brought us to visit a random family's home compound to illustrate the Balinese philosophy of welcoming all and sundry to their home (hence the front gates are always open during the day). I feel I really have a deeper understanding and respect for the Balinese culture in the two short but action packed days my family of 2 adults and 2 boys (aged 7 and 11) spent with him. Wayan speaks fluent English and Japanese, so if you're looking for a knowledgeable and licenced tour guide and a safe driver all in one, look no further than Wayan!"

His incredible knowledge of the Island, and willingness to share his deep spiritual ties to HInduism, led to a vast amount of learning for my wife and I. We hired him for our first week, and he took us on multiple trips to the temples throughout the country, volcanoes, gorgeous terraced rice fields in the mountains, as well as to many villages to see the \"real Bali.\" We were blessed by having found Wayan and he made us feel like \"family\" while we were there.Danny and Miriam"

Always given the option to leave each attraction when we were ready it was a steady paced tour which lasted approx 10 hours none of which were tiresome.

He was able to customize a full day tour for us, visiting a school, a temple, a luwak coffee farm, and a hike across some rice terraces. Perhaps the most unique part of the tour was visiting the compound of a Balinese family. We thought that perhaps we would visit a pre-arranged family, but we just waltzed into a random house and learned about the family's compound and Balinese homes in general. While this would never fly in the Western world, apparently all Balinese homes are open to visitors. Very cool experience.Wayan Suka's English was great, and we really enjoyed all of his insights into Balinese culture. Our tour was definitely one of the highlights of our visit! Highly recommended. "

Please know when you're booking through him, it is a family oriented business and he truly cares about its reputation and making customers happy. He embodies the true spirit of Bali as he makes it a point to greet the locals we come across, always with a genuine smile on his face. When speaking with him, you will have a genuine conversation about all aspects of life and he not only teaches you about Balinese culture but about life in general! He was very prompt with the email replies and was very accommodating when my flight time changed last minute. Remember to book a few days or weeks in advance cause he gets busy!I took a full day tour with Wayan and he took me to the marketplace (I was the only tourist in the whole place), to a traditional Balinese home (just a tip - I wish I brought some gifts for the family), the rice terraces, waterfall, the coffee plantation, the water temple, and a lunch spot at batur mountain. He was able to squeeze in the elephant temple, was able to find me a working atm and even dropped me off to my next tourist destination when the tour was over! He even has a sarong prepared for the tourists like myself who wear shorts while entering the temple. The rate was a lot cheaper than other tours and it does vary depending on your itinerary :) Overall I can't sing enough praise for this man. If you book with him, you'll be in good hands.

We loved stopping at a little local food market, eating durian by the side of the road and visiting a coffee plantation. Seeing some of the temples and learning about them was a wonderful experience."

            "review": "Such an amazing day!. We have just returned from a day packed full of culture and amazing sightseeing experiences!. As this was our first time in Ubud, Amansuka tailored the day to exactly what we wanted to do and filled us with so much Balinese traditional along the way. We visited a number of temples, one being the Holy Spring Temple. This was so great to see as so many people were involved in the religious cleansing ritual! We visited a traditional Balinese Home, art gallery, waterfall, volcanoe, rice terraces, wood carving, coffee plantation and even a ceremony taking place at a temple in a local village. Our day was packed full but it flew by so quickly. The best part of the trip was Amansuka himself, so knowledgeable of Balinese custom, he accompanied us whereever we wanted to go and went to great lengths to explain everything we wanted understand! Amansuka's English was great, he was very funny and also quite spiritual; we learnt some great lessons about ourselves and about how life should really be lived. \"Always smile, it costs nothing and most of all, be happy!\" We highly recommend having a tour and spending a day with him."

They were great and we would recommend them to anyone looking for a driver. They were able to provide a car seat for my toddler which was greatly appreciated. The car was clean and comfortable and they provide water and umbrellas in case of rain. Our day trip around ubud was fantastic and wayan was a great guide and very informative.

This was a tour around two temples, including the holy Spring which should not be missed, the volcano, rice terraces various villages so we saw how the Balinese people lived and worked but best of all was a visit to a private house of a family here, the family allowed us into their compound and Wayan showed us round so we could ask questions about the family and learn about their life.His English is excellent and local knowledge faultless, we felt like we had had a really enjoyable day at the same time as learning so much about this lovely island, and avoiding the tourist hoards at the same time.Can't recommend this guy highly enough! Thank you Wayan"

JUST WOW.My husband and I had a very quick stopover trip in Bali, and our day spent with Wayan was one of the highlights of our 5 week trip. He was quick to respond to all of my emails, as we changed plans on him a couple of times. From the second he picked us up, he was energetic and friendly and he speaks wonderful English. He has really funny jokes, too.We chose to do a tour that he recommended, visiting the Monkey Forest, a balinese house, waterfall, coffee plantation, volcano, and the rice fields. It was so much to see in one day!! He accompanied us to the Monkey Forest, which I appreciated because I would have been very skiddish to give monkeys bananas, but he ensured us it was safe, and it was so fun! He recommended a great place for us to eat lunch overlooking a volcano and took pictures of us during the entire trip. After our day tour, he asked us if we wanted transportation to the airport. He was cheaper than our resort, so we said yes, but our flight didn't leave until 1 am. Wayan dropped us off in the city to get massages and dinner, picked us back up and then drove us to the airport with very short notice! Most of all, my favorite part was listening to his lessons on Balinese lifestyle and insight, which I found extremely inspiring. He literally made me want to move to Bali and live life like they do! Thank you Wayan for the best day! Highly highly recommend using him for your day(s) in Bali!!"

He was so knowledgeable and brought us to all the places we requested and tailored our tour to things that we wanted to see. I loved that he was so accommodating but also gave his opinion about what would be worth it to visit. We booked the touring for a day and a half and saw so much! We visited a beautiful waterfall, 2 rice terraces, and 3 temples (Tanah Lot, Turta Empul, Ulun Danu Beratan). After our touring, Wayan was so nice enough to drop us off at our new hotel in Seminyak from where he initially picked us up in Ubud. I will definitely be booking a tour with him again when I return to Bali in the future! Thanks Wayan!"

            "review": "Disappointing tour. We were really looking forward to the two days we have booked with Wayan. Especially after reading all the good reviews here. However the tour was a big disappointment. As it turns out this company works with several guides named Wayan (as it is the name given to firstborns in Bali) and not all of them are equally good guides. Reading the reviews and looking at the website one can get the impression that there is only one Wayan. This is not the case, but they failed to clear this up.Our guide was quite different from what you can read here. His English wasn't good and therefore it was hard to follow his blurry explanations you really had to concentrate to get like at least half of it. He brought us to all the must see places of course, but any driver could have done that for less. We didn't get any information on Balis history, and had to look up all the places afterwards. On the first day he brought us to a very touristy restaurant at lake Batur. It was a fishy looking badly presented buffet lunch at a price for 135k/person. It was a rip off considering the quality of food and considering that we had very nice food throughout our stay in Indonesia for a lot less. When we told him, he said that there one has to pay for the view and not for the food. Next day we ended up eating at a similar place. When we told him that we are not impressed at all, he said that two months ago it was a good place maybe they had changed the chef since... Then I have checked Tripadvisor again, as I could not believe that this service has so good reviews and only then did I realise that the guy smiling on the pictures here in the reviews is not the guy driving the car I am sitting in. Huge disappointment.I am sure that our Wayan is a really nice person as well, I am sure he did his best, but we expected more and the whole story felt like a tourist scam. We had several drivers during our stay here in Bali and this service was in no ways better than theirs only more expensive. We would have been better off with 'just a driver' and looking up all the stories for ourselves. We just thought a guide would be a nice treat at the end of our stay in Bali.At the end my husband tried to tell him how disappointed we are but obviously he only understood 'tripadvisor' and 'compliment' instead of 'complaint' as he encouraged us to write a review so they get better rankings. It was very sad."

We got to visit a number of temples of varied structures and significance (gunung kawi, tirta empul, goa gajah) as well as a nice lunch stop overlooking ricefields, an afterlunch swim at tegenungan waterfalls, and even Uluwatu temple for the stunning cliff views. Wayan accompanied us at each of the sites and was very informative about the temples as well as about Balinese life and philosophies in general.

I did the Singaraja Lovina tour, visiting the stunning Ulun Danu Bratan temple where we arrived before the tour buses and we stumbled on a local religious ceremony - Wayan explained to me what was happening, so I was able to appreciate it much more than I would have if I'd found it on my own. We also went to a beautiful waterfall (note: the walk to Gitgit Waterfall is somewhat difficult, but Wayan was patient with me), had a relaxed lunch on a quiet beach, and visited a scenic monastery and an interesting holy hot spring - I thought the itinerary sounded very ambitious, but we got through everything, and I didn't feel rushed.I booked direct with Amansuka Tours by email - it was easy to do since Wayan usually replied to my emails within 24 hours. He offered an airport transfer, that was great too - Wayan's nephew (he was lovely but I've forgotten his name) picked me up at the airport with my name on a sign, we had a really interesting chat on the long drive to Ubud, and he even gave me a free orientation drive around town. I also asked for a transfer to my next hotel in Seminyak, that too was a fun ride with Wayan's nephew.I paid just 60USD for the day tour, an amazingly good deal - Viator charges about twice that, and I think (based on prior experience elsewhere in South East Asia) hotels would also charge twice that if you ask them to arrange a guide for you. For each transfer I paid 25USD, that's slightly more than what online searches say the taxi fare is, but I think it's worth paying a little more to feel as safe as I felt with this company."

I went to Ubud without planning much sightseeing, but the day was worth it and Wayan made it so. The rice terrace was beautiful. It was a hot day but Wayan patiently walked with me. Too bad that the sun set was cloudy, but we compensated it with a banana pancake with a view of Tanah Lot and the ocean.

Wayan took us to the local market and we picked out some fruit and tried a couple other interesting snacks. One being a rice and banana snack all wrapped up in a banan leaf. It was really delicious. Our guide explained so much to us about local traditions and rituals and answered the millions of questions I had. Following there we went to a locals house and hung out with a family. We got to see their home and the way they live. This was a heart warming experience. The one man was an amazing painter. I just loved his work so much I refused to leave without one of his pieces to take home. I'm very grateful to be able to hang his work up at home. He also had a niece about 2 years old and she was just adorable. She melted my heart. We also visited the rice terrace which was so beautiful. Wayan knew all the good trails to take and tips to avoid additional costs by taking photos with the workers etc . He also demonstrated his skills in the bamboo drums ( I don't remember the actual name for the instrument) but Wayan was really good. We then proceeded to lunch with a stunning view of the active volcano. We had the choice of eating at the fancy touristy restaurant or the local one across the street. We chose to the local one and it was very very good. We then proceeded to holey water temple. Thank goodness for Wayan being so prepared. I forgot all about the appropriate attire for the temple and he had come with extra sarongs which worked out awesome. Wayan knew the history and legendary stories of the temple which was so fascinating. It felt very majestic walking around, kind of like the eat pray love vibe. I really enjoyed it. Lastly we headed to the waterfall. This was fun,great views. (Tons of stairs) cool spot for pictures. We didn't go swimming but we did cross and hike up the other side of the cliff which was stunning. I really couldn't say enough positive things about this tour and our guide. He made our trip in ubud so memorable. I learnt so much from him and am so grateful to have met him. I highly recommend doing this tour. "

I will be revisiting\u00a0 soon and will surely use his services once again. I am happy to call Wayan Suka a friend.Jaqueline A Italy"

Having read Wayans fantastic reviews on trip advisor I contacted him two weeks ahead of our trip, he emailed me back very promptly and was happy to help when we needed to change the date - we very much appreciated his flexibility with this! When the day came for our tour he was promptely waiting for us at our hotel, and even emailed me to confirm he had arrived. Upon meeting Wayan we knew we would have a fantastic day, his car was beautifully clean and thank goodness for the wonderful air con and water which Wayan provided as it was a hot day! Wayan suggested places for our trip which were all wonderful, such as a Balinese dance in a local village, and the coffee plantations, and the water temple where he lent us sarongs- but was again flexible when we asked to please visit the elephant safari and graciously waited whilst we stopped there for an hour or so. We so enjoyed Wayans company and his conversation which gave us a real insight into Balinese culture. I would highly recommend Wayan Suka to anyone visiting Bali and we wish him and his family all the best for the future. Thank you again Wayan - it's been our favourite day in Bali!"

Our guide Wayan has arranged and tailor made our itin to maximise our day and see the cultural and scenery in Bali. We visited the local morning market where we are the only tourists and tried out some traditional Balinese cakes. Then we visited a local family, played with their kid and had coffee in their house! It is truly a taste of the real Balinese life. Wayan arranged a scenery spot with the volcano right in front for lunch. Avocado juice is a must try! We then also visited the legendary water temple, breathtaking rice paddles field and waterfall!"

I've had drivers conduct personal day tours around the world but Wayan is the best!I engaged Wayan after reading the reviews and he was 'the best'. My wife and 9yo son were picked up from our hotel in Ubud at 8:30a and we had a team meeting about where and what we wanted to do & see. Wayan also made some suggestions that complimented the all-day private tour e.g. visiting a traditional/authentic Balinese home (with people inside going about their daily business) and a swim at the nearby waterfall. Wayan engaged us in the history of Bali including the Hindu religion and rituals. We visited the usual tourist areas such the volcano, monkey forest and temples but a nice unscheduled side stop was to a coffee plantation where we tasted the famous 'Bucket List' lewak coffee. The whole day was zero stress or no stop offs being driven to pre-determined shops (like is typically done in China). Wayan was keen to take us to wherever we wanted to go for a long as we liked. We eventually 'tapped out' at 4:30p and arrived back at our hotel. We were so impressed with the service and value for money that we've engaged Wayan again tomorrow to see some more Balinese towns up until we fly home tomorrow evening."

Right from our first contact with Wayan, to the confirmation email, the prompt timing of pick-ups at our separate addresses (one in Seminyak, we were in Ubud) to the abundance of knowledge about Bali and the Hindu culture, the humour and value for money, I have to say that Wayan went above and beyond to make sure our day trip was a most memorable, informative and enjoyable experience.We saw the natural beauty of the waterfall at Tegenungan, the magnificence of the volcano at Kintamani (where Wayan said he preferred to take us to the quieter restaurant rather than the huge ones where the coach loads go) and the rice terraces just outside of Ubud at Tegallalang.Wayan gave us a deep insight into Balinese life and the Hindu culture and answered every question we asked with both a beautiful humility as well as a touch of cheeky humour. We visited a Balinese house, the Batuan temple and Tirta Empul (the holy water temple). The temple was founded in the 11th century but what impressed me most was the depth of Wayan's knowledge historically and factually, but also the mythology of the holy temple and the Hindu tradition of the Balinese.We could not have asked for a better day! And as for value for money, I had to send an email to re-confirm that it was correct. The price was per tour, not per person and at U$60 with two pick ups and a 7 hour day, we couldn't believe it. Just remember to take some extra cash for donations to temples of nominal entrance fees, a dollar here, a couple of dollars there, 3 dollars to enter Kintamani. It's all explained in the confirmation email from Wayan.Next time, we are in Bali we will do a day trip to West Bali and we will be calling Wayan. Thank you for showing us the best of Bali, you are the best of Bali.See you, next time, Martin & the gang"

First stop a walk (and photo opportunity), down into the rice paddies. It was a very hot day, so it was a relief to be handed a cold bottle of water and face towel once back in the car. We visited varies temples throughout the day, our favourite being Pura Tirta Empul, where we took part in a water purification ceremony. Another highlight was lunch, where we sat in a restaurant overlooking the beautiful Mount Batur (an active volcano). Wayan was very knowledgeable with everything he spoke about, and at the same time kept it interesting and funny. Tour is flexible, just tell him what you want to see. Great value for money!!

We originally booked as we saw how highly rated he was on trip advisor and within a few hours of emailing him he had replied with a day free for us and a list of things he would recommend completely tailored to us. He also advised if there was anything extra we wanted to do just let him know and he would be happy to. He arrived perfectly on time and from the minute we got in his modern air conditioned car, I immediately liked him. He was so happy and friendly but so knowledgable. Everything we drove past he would let us know of its significance and I learnt more about Bali and Balonese people in that day than I did for my entire trip. The sights we saw were beautiful and it was by far my best day in Bali. For the sake of $50 between us for the whole day, with our own private tour guide, it was just such great value for money! He knew EVERYTHING. I really really cannot stress enough how incredible Wayan was. These reviews certainly were not lying! He told us so much about their culture and religious beliefs and showed us places that we would have no idea existed just by looking on Google. If you are considering a tour to do whilst in Ubud you will regret it if you don't book with him. It's probably the best value for money I've ever got. Wayan is a wonderful man, and Ubud is an incredibly beautiful place. I will never forget yesterday, ever. Ps he's also a man united fan so if that's not a reason to book with him then I don't know what is!"

The waterfall was just stunning, and we were the first ones there. So peaceful. The rice paddies he took me to see were also mindblowing, it was just such a huge area and it was all so lush and green. Simply beautiful! He also told me a lot about balinese culture and their beliefs. His english is so good, and I had a wonderful time listening to him, learning new things.

Wayan was really able to teach us many things about the Balinese culture and the sites we visited, with a funny personal twist so it definitely did not feel like a lesson :-) This was the best tour we did on our 12 day Bali trip!"

We chose to do the 'Mother Temple' and 'Morning Market' tours from the website. Both these tours are very well organised. Bali is a beautiful island and Wayan is the perfect guide to help you explore it. He is very knowledgeable and his English is very good. He is a great conversationalist, teaching us about the history and culture of Bali and also about his family, home and religion. A highlight of the tour was meeting a beautiful Balinese family to see how they live and be taught how to make offerings in the Hindu religion. I would certainly recommend Wayan to anyone wanting to explore Bali and hopefully one day we can return and see him again. Don't hesitate and book him now!"

When we were caught out in the open during a rain storm, Wayan's concern was evident and very much appreciated. (It was fine).He also didn't mind when we were less than stellar passengers and passed out while he drove the bumpy dirt roads. =D"

We started off at the Elephant Safari Park, then went to Gunung Kawi, Tirta Empul, Kintamani and Tegalalang. Throughout the day, Wayan gave us an account of Bali and the Balinese and way of life.

I was able to see big tourist attractions like the elephant safari park to the rice terraces and genuine Balinese experiences such as sitting in a Balinese family home to watching their annual festival thanking God for the harvest.He was punctual, kind, honest and had great energy! I saw so much in two days and went at my pace. I learned so much about Bali and their beautiful culture, making me fall in love with this place even more. This my first trip to Bali and won't be my last and I'm pretty sure Wayan made all their difference. As a single-female traveler I felt completely safe with him at all times. And I don't trust easily. He has set tours on his website that are flexible to your taste and you can ask about seeing specific things not on his tours as well. He also does airport transfers and replies to emails quickly."

Was ok, showed us factories, temples, told us a few things about the culture. All in all a fine day.BUT THEN, we arrived at our resort Svarga Loka near Ubud, and this time, I wanted to find a GOOD tour. So I handed our resort a TON of phone numbers to try, including Amansuka. And boy, were we glad we got him. He showed us many many beautiful views, a dance, temples, a random regular Balinese house (apparently you can just walk in any traditional Balinese home) and explained its composition, talked of many nice stories of his religion and their views, and shared a lot of interesting facts about their culture and way of living. We saw monkeys, waterfalls, a volcano, royal temple, markets, a guy climbing a palm tree bare handed to let me drink from a fresh coconut etc etc.Wayan Suka, \"your friend\" (as he calls himself), was insanely kind, super funny and very knowledgeable. We HAD to see him again, so we asked him to bring us to the airport few days later.Few tips: (1) ask him about: smiles, problems, and positivity. Very inspiring views.(2) don't let your hotel organize this tour. It cost us 15 dollars more because the resort claimed a part."

First a day tour in Ubud to see the local temples and sites and the next was a more extensive tour taking in a morning market, the waterfall, the volcano, Tirta Empul and Goa Gajah. Both tours felt very tailored to us and Wayan was very sensitive to my abilities with the temple steps and the sticky heat! He even stopped to give me a little bit of reflexology when the heat got to my head. I felt as though I learned so much more about Balinese culture than I would have if we had directed ourselves and it was particularly special to spend some time in the morning market and a Balinese home which gave us a taste of what Balinese life is really like. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend him."

He was friendly and chatty without being too much so that we still had our space.He was very flexible and customised the day depending on what we wanted to see. We got picked up in Sanur and visited:- a traditional Balinese house - very interesting to understand more about the culture- ancient batuan temple - beautiful and he explained what everything was for- rice terrace - beautiful, exactly like on postcards, and we had lunch in a warung overlooking the terrace which was great- ubud and the monkey forest sanctuary - really fun and beautiful forest, a must do!- tenenungan waterfall which he recommended we did at the end so that we could take our time, go for a swim under the waterfall - was quite busy (full of tourists like us) but was still great and it's an impressive waterfall. We enjoyed the swim as it was refreshing after such a hot day!Overall we had a fantastic day and I can't recommend him enough.

The day before our tour, I emailed confirming what time he would pick us up and let him know what hotel we were at in Seminyak (a well known hotel). Wayan misunderstood and also couldn't read the entire email, so he went to our hotel in Ubud to pick us up the next morning. But we were waiting for him in Seminyak. After emails and calling him, we agreed to continue with the day, and Wayan drove to Seminyak to pick us up. We started the day an hour and a half after we had planned (11:00 instead of 9:30), which was a bummer, but we're confident that this was a one time hiccup for Wayan. He was apologetic, and we understood the miscommunication. Not a big deal for us (we're pretty relaxed), but just something to keep in mind in terms of confirming with him!"

The price was very reasonable.Wayan picked us up at 9 and we went to a local market. By coincidence we witnessed a huge ceremony at this village. Beautiful. We toured the market and Wayan, being a farmer himself, was able to explain a lot.From there we went to a ricefield where we made a walk and talked with him about Bali agriculture, met some farmers on the way. Interesting.Time to go for a Bali coffee at a street stand. Across the street a ceremony was going on in a temple and Wayan gave us the proper dress to attend the ceremony. There was cock fighting, dance, a lot of offering and we felt welcome. It was impressive and the explanations of Wayan helped understanding all of it.From here we went to visit a Balinese house and again the explanations were very good.After a lunch at a local warung we went to see a big temple (forgot the name) and on to Tanah Lot. Actually, you probably need to see Tanah Lot, but for us the rest of the day had been much more interesting.We really enjoyed this tour. Wayan is a pleasant, open guy to talk to.

I highly recommend choosing him for your tour in Bali"

Wayan provides not only the recommended tours in his website, but also itinerary suited our own needs. For example, he drove us to visit traditional Balinese house and attend traditional Balinese ceremony. There were no other tourists except us, it didn't like common commercial sightseeing spot. Without him, we couldn't have the chance to experience. Wayan put his mind to all my requests, such as to learn Balinese culture...I'll never forget that I wore salon (Wayan prepared in advance) and had offering in my head. So amazing! And he prepared bottle water and cold towel for us. Thank you, Wayan Suka, my friend in Bali!"

He is a bit higher in cost ($5), but he was willing to take us places that our other driver wasn't. That was huge for me because I wanted to get out of the touristy areas, which meant traveling further out and on some rougher roads! By the end of an amazing two days, we were more than happy to give Wayan some extra tip money because of his amazing attitude and services. We also felt so safe and taken care of with Wayan, which was important for us as two young women traveling around Bali. Wayan took us to a VERY local market after hearing that we wanted to eat some local fare. While we were scarfing down suckling pig, Wayan bought us a drink that soothes stomachs (to prevent \"Bali belly\") and bought me several coconut peanut snacks found at local markets, which he had also overheard me saying I loved-- so so sweet of him!! I could not get over his hospitality. He also taught me a little Hindu life lesson about appreciating the good and forgetting the bad. This helped me through the next day when I had a terrible sunburn- I just reminded myself of the amazing adventures that lead me to the pain of the sunburn :). Thanks again for everything Wayan!!"

He spoke very good English, was always on time, and showed us not only his vast knowledge of Bali and got us to some very pretty places, but was also quick to adapt the plans to any ideas we had short term ( for example a mass cremation ceremony, which are rather rare events). The car was comfortable, I appreciated to have water and refreshing towels after visits, and I personally like to have a guide like him, who will crack a joke every once in a while. We used his services for 3 days, and even though we probably didn't see all of what Bali has to offer, he clearly gave us a good insight of the Balinese culture. We started our tour on day one from Sanur and finished in Ubud from where we saw most of the center on day 2. For our last tour he drove us until Jimbaran and showed us very nice sites on the way trying to avoid al the touristic crowd. I highly recommend him, he's very flexible, and a very safe driver. He always have good suggestion on what to see and if you feel like doing something different during the day you can always change your plans last minute. If it's possible, he will help you. He also gave us very good advices on where to eat and where to go to have a massage in Ubud. We wish him all the best and we will definitely call him again next time we visit Bali."

After doing a bit of research online, we decided that it would be best to hire a driver to take us around each day, rather than depending on taxi\u2019s. I found Wayan Amansuka through Trip Advisor and after reading all of his wonderful reviews, decided to book him for the week. From the first communication, I was extremely impressed by Wayan. He was very professional and friendly in all of his emails. He read through the itinerary we put together and provided great feedback on how to make it better. He included prices for each of the daily tours and called out any entrance fees that may apply. Wayan\u2019s prices are also very reasonable, ranging from $50-60 USD for 8-10 hours of driving and $30 USD for airport transfers. Some may say that you can find cheaper drivers on the street, but I can guarantee they won\u2019t be as good as Wayan Amansuka! Before leaving for our trip, we felt comfortable and confident in Wayan and his team and were excited to meet him at the airport. Unfortunately, our flight arrived late and we had no way to contact Wayan. However, as soon as we got through customs, we saw Wayan waiting to greet us with a big smile! Over the next week, we hung out with Wayan and team for 3 day tours and 2 hotel/airport transfers. Wayan\u2019s nephew, Arjana, took us on a tour of South Kuta, Wayan\u2019s best friend, Madea, took us on a tour to Lovina, and Wayan himself accompanied us on a tour to North Kuta\u2026all of which was amazing! With Amansuka and team, you will feel comfortable, safe, and most importantly, you will have a great time! Wayan and team were always punctual in picking us up and also flexible with our plans throughout the day. If we wanted to stop for photos or to grab something to eat, they did so without hesitation. We truly felt that they were there to accommodate us and make sure that we were having a great time. They also provided HEAPS of great information. We can honestly say that the best part of our trip was learning about the culture and religion in Bali. Something else to point out is the fact that Wayan and team are all awesome drivers. If you have ever been to Bali you know how chaotic the roads are. We had no idea what to expect and let\u2019s just say that we were SO thankful to have Wayan and team driving us around. Wayan and team also had clean, reliable cars with air conditioning. They provided us with bottled water and even whipped out little snacks every now and then. With Wayan and team, conversation also flowed easily. We spent a lot of time in the car driving and never once did we feel awkward or uncomfortable. Overall, we were very satisfied with the services we received from Wayan Amansuka and team and would highly recommend them to anyone visiting Bali. Thank you Wayan and team for showing us your beautiful country and for creating amazing memories with us!"

The 6 of us ended up at nungnung waterfall. It was AMAZING!! We were the only travellers there and we swum as close as we could to the roaring water. So much fun. A steep climb of about 400 steps each way so it's not for the faint hearted. We also visited Ulun Danu Bratan temple. Wayan organised for his nephew to help take us all down to Legian on our departure. No problems whatsoever. I highly recommend Wayan and will contact him again on our next visit (and hope that he's not booked out which may be the case as word gets out about his super service and reliability.

            "review": "Absolutely outstanding! Best tour driver in Bali!. After receiving many glowing recommendations of Amansuka Tours on the Trip Advisor forums I booked Wayan for a day tour.Wayan replied to my emails quickly and was very helpful providing information to help me choose our tour stops. On the day he picked us up on time in a very clean, late model vehicle with excellent air conditioning.He was so friendly and put us at ease immediately letting us know where we would be going first. He very kindly arranged for us to go to Bali Bird Park as the first stop on our tour as he knew this was when the birds would be most active and we would be there in time to see one of their great shows.After the bird park he had cold bottles of water waiting for us and later in the day he had more water and cold towels to refresh ourselves which was a thoughtful touch and very much appreciated.We also stopped at a Luwak coffee plantation, Goa Gajah, Tirta Empul and Tegalalan Rice Terrace. At each of these stops Wayan was an excellent and informative guide, providing us with so much information we that really added to our experience. At lunch he took us to a wonderful restaurant, Bebek Tepi Sawah, which turned out to be one of the best meals we had on our holiday. Wayan was happy to take photos for us and answer any of our questions. He tells some hilariously bad jokes too - such a funny man!Wayan offered to make other stops after our last stop, including a tour of a Balinese home, which we were not able to do on the day but I will most definitely be back and will book Wayan for a few days to do this and more.I often travel alone and have hesitated to book private tours in the past for safety reasons - I would absolutely book Wayan when I am travelling alone in future. He is trustworthy, speaks excellent English and is a good driver. I can't speak highly enough of him.Thank you for a wonderful day Wayan, from Karma and Gen."

He is one of the kindest, most generous people I have ever met. Wayan speaks amazing english and has so much knowledge to share about all of the different places in Bali. At first we hired Wayan just to drive us from Seminyak to Uluwatu. He not only drove us the 1.5 hours, he generously offered to stop at the Uluwatu temple with us and play with the monkeys! He has so much love and enthusiasm for Balinese culture - its such a pleasure just being in his company. When we eventually made it to Ubud, Wayan picked us up each morning and took us around for nearly 8 hours each day. We stopped at all of the major temples, the elephant safari, monkey forest, coffee plantation, rice paddies and more. He knew all of the best places to sit and enjoy the incredible sites. To add - his rates are unmatch-able. He gives you the \"friend\" pricing which cant be beat! I assure you that Wayan is the best around! I would recommend him to anyone and everyone traveling Bali"

I sent him an email to which I received a prompt reply and arranged for him to pick the 5 of us up from the airport and drive us to our accommodation at Greenfields in Ubud. I had also told him in the email that we would like him to take us touring the next day but weren't sure exactly where. He had replied that would be fine and we could discuss places to go when he met us at the airport. Wayan was exceptional - he was there in the crowd with our clearly marked sign and we had a good drive up to Ubud. He stopped for us to exchange money as I had requested. We talked about our itinerary for the next day and he got an idea what we were interested in. He collected us the next morning and we have the most memorable day ever touring (I had been to Bali many times but the 4 friends I travelled with hadn't been at all). He spoke excellent English and gave us a lot of the history and information about Bali along the way. I would highly recommend Wayan to anyone and he is in fact doing a day for friends of mine who are coming in on a cruise ship just for the day in January. Thanks Wayan - and can't wait for my next trip to Bali and to travel with you again. Bronwen"

Wayan picked me up at the airport and impressed me from the very start. His enthusiasm for sharing his love of the Balinese culture is infectious. On the drive to my hotel, he was already pointing out notable sights and introducing me to the local culture and traditional practices. As a female that was traveling alone, I felt very safe with Wayan as my guide. He was always very polite, a safe driver, and a great teller of jokes. He even helped me locate my hotel - which was located down a dodgy little alleyway at night. Later in my stay, Wayan took a friend and I on a private tour, sprinkling fun facts throughout a day visiting temples, rice paddies, and even a Balinese home. When we wanted to do a bit of shopping, he even went ahead and negotiated better prices than tourists would ever be able to secure alone. In addition, every time we stopped at a new location, he would pull a new surprise out of the back of the car: local fruits, bottles of water, cooling cloths, and more. Because of Wayan, I feel as though I have more of an insider perspective of the culture and a resulting affection for it as well. You can tell that he truly loves where he comes from and wants to share that love with everyone he encounters. I am lucky to be able to call Wayan my friend, and I hope our paths will cross again one day."

They did not take us to any tourist trap or shopping to get commission. We didn't want to waste time for that. Only pure tour around Bali. We make up our own time to started the day, and they were always there on time. We didn't feel like we were being rush in each attraction, we could take as much time as we wanted to.Wayan loves his job being a driver and tour guide. He loves to learn which restaurant or hotel is good, so he can recommend it to his next customer. If you don't want to make up your own itinerary, he will also have recommendations for you. He took us to Tegalalang Rice Terrace, and even walk down the rice field with us. That was wonderful experience.His price is also very reasonable. Wayan's team member pick us up from Amed with couple stop over in Temples and beach. He made sure we have just enough time to get to the airport, not wasting too much time waiting in the airport."

I contacted him before I left for Bali and informed him of where I would be staying and where I would end up. Wayan planned the sights to see on our trip based on what I had wanted to see. I didn't have e-mail access the first week in Bali but he took the initiative to call the place I was staying to confirm the pick up time! Amazing because I was worried that he would have tried to contact me and I had no way of contacting him. I was really impressed by his initiative and determination. He picked me up on time and took me to several places, during the drive he explained Bali culture, education, marriage, etc-shared so much and I learned a tremendous amount on the drive with him. He is also great at taking photos based on what he's learned from other tourist. He is funny and likes to tell jokes. Unfortunately I needed to be picked up at 10 instead of the suggested 8am and it cut the tour short since it was too dark to see anything- so keep that in mind. Most drivers will charge you what Wayan Amansuka will charge you without the tour guide knowledge and experience. He picks you up in a great car with air condintioning and provides bottled water during the ride. I would definately recommend him to anyone interested in seeing the best sites and learning about Bali culture."

Wayan is a native of Ubud who is clearly passionate about helping visitors understand his culture and religion and the way it pervades the everyday life of locals in Ubud. He does this in a very sincere and matter of fact way without ever slipping into the Western pandering mysticism that sometimes cloaks Bali. He will tell you about how he and everyone else grew up learning the traditional arts. He will tell you about growing rice and how his family still growth their own today. He will tell you the meaning of all the little decorative offerings in front of homes. He will tell you where to find quality local art or jewellery but only if you ask. He will never push you to go shopping. Wayan is also an accredited and fully licensed Indonesian Guide. This is very important if you want to visit the Mother Temple of Besakih, which is frankly a must-see in Bali. Unfortunately, the Mother Temple is plagued by organized thugs that demand 100,000+ Rp from each visitors as is well documented on TripAdvisor. The only people they will not bother are those accompanied by a licensed Indonesian Guide. We walked straight in having only paid the de minimus actual admission fee and had access to the entire temple including those areas for locals only. Wayan's knowledge of the Temple far exceeding anything in the guide books and he turned what for many is a horrible Balinese experience into one of our best Balinese experiences. Wayan's rates are very reasonable and just a slight premium over the cheapest drivers you can find. He charged me 550,000 Rp (about US$60) for a 10 hour tour all over Bali. Frankly, for the money you spend getting to Bali, you would be crazy to go with someone other than Wayan because of price."

Wayan is genuine and honest about Ubud and Bali and we thank him for making our stay great and our understanding of Bali & its culture made the trip more memorable. Coming from a senior's perspective, it really made our two earlier holidays. (The first entirely in Ubud, the second - with Wayan and taking tours from Sanur). We hope to make a third trip some time. We recommend him to anyone going to Bali and our friends who have been with Wayan agree, they wouldnt go with anyone else."

His deep integrity and thoughtful tours made me feel as if I had a friend in Bali. I have recommended him to several friends, all of whom agree that he made their trip truly special, customizing itineraries for individual tastes. He is knowledgeable, intelligent, diligent and careful. He will show you a Bali that you won't see on your own. If you meet him and use his services, you will be delighted."

The only way to make Bali even more amazing than it already is is by having Wayan Suka at your side.He very much mirrors the humility and grace of Ubud, and his amazing insights allow all of the local culture and flavor to shine. Having Wayan guide you through Bali is as close as a foreigner can get to a truly family affair.Wayan is incredibly responsible and responsive, someone who is reachable at a moment's notice and who is of the utmost integrity.I cannot recommend him more highly."

He collected us each day from the idyllic Villa Dhyan and arranged our day beautifully whether it be a cycling tour through local villages, rafting on the river or hiking to see the largest banyan tree in Asia. He is funny, gentle, knowledgeable and kind. You really could not ask for a better guide. I totally recommend him as do our 7,8 and 10 year old children :)"

            "review": "Outstanding service and knowledge... made our trip. My fiance and I visited Bali at the beginning of June and Wayan's tour was certainly one of the trip highlights. Like other reviewers on here we booked before we went with Wayan because of his quick and courteous emails and the considered advice that he gave us regarding the most appropriate tours and use of our time. Wayan's high level of customer service continued from there. He always ensured that we saw what we wanted and that we had the time that we wanted at each location. He was happy to adjust the day throughout as we saw fit without hesitation. I cannot recommend his services enough if you want to get out and see some of Bali beyond the tourist hot-spots. Wayan's knowledge is fantastic and he shares it in an enthusiastic yet not overbearing way. Wayan will welcome you like an old friend and treat you with the same warmth and hospitality. Initially we booked to spend one day with Wayan however because we enjoyed the first day so much we booked a second day as soon as we could. We probably would have booked another if we had the time as we saw so much of Bali that we wouldn't have done without a knowledgeable, friendly and enthusiastic guide. On the second day of touring with Wayan my other half and Wayan were talking about how much we had enjoyed the local sambal. The next day before we left to travel home Wayan delivered some homemade sambal to our hotel so that we could enjoy the taste of Bali for a bit longer once we arrived home. You certainly don't get that service from many places at all!Like I say, I highly recommend at least one day touring Bali with Wayan. It is certainly well worth the money you will pay."

We would highly recommend Wayan of Amansuka Tours after spending 4 days with him seeing Nth Bali.Initially I emailed 4 Bali drivers , all recommended on Trip Advisor, Wayan was engaged because of his quick replies which answered our particular questions and also offered suggestions.Wayan met us at the Ferry port between Java and Bali, a 3 hr drive from his home (Ubud ),punctual then as he always was.From the first we realised we had found a friend not just a driver, his great sense of humour added to our enjoyment of our holiday.Not only a driver, Wayan is also an excellent guide full of knowledge and interesting items of information, accompanying us on our side trips instead of waiting by the car as many drivers do.He showed us a side of Bali so wonderfully different to what we see and hear about in Australia.Interpreting for us so we could speak to local farmers when we walked the rice terraces.Seeing a local Balinese house and family which I'm sure had never had tourists inside before, but so friendly.His car was excellent, a late model Toyota Innova with plenty of room and a/c.Bali was for us meant to be a short stop over after our 10 days in Java, however Wayan helped us enjoy it so much that we will be back, and for sure will be using Wayans services and staying in his guest house."

And he has indeed become a close friend over the years.Wayan showed us Bali like no other, steeping us in the immensely rich culture of the land and the people. It would not be an exaggeration to say that Wayan was one of the main reasons why we love Bali so much. He showed us the real Bali beyond the resorts and touristy sites and so much more.My husband and I felt so at ease under his guide-- not only was he professional (more than punctual- arriving earlier than slated time, safe, knowledgeable, superb command of English), he was kind, honest, trustworthy and a true ambassador for the Balinese people-- embodying true warmth and hospitality. We learned so much about Balinese culture, history, spirituality, communal life, and as a result had such an amazing connection to the land, the people, and the spirit of the island.\u00a0I should mention that his driving is **excellent** and his vehicle is one of the nicest on the road- very well-maintained (and competitive rates too!). WE RECOMMEND HIM wholeheartedly and wish him and his family the best."

I emailed him on the recommendation of a friend, the very first time I went to Bali. I was nervous as I was a girl travelling alone but I didn't need to worry, he was there waiting at the airport for me, a friendly face. I had a list in my head of things I wanted to do. Swim in a waterfall.. go visit the real Bali (not just tourist things). Go to buy a Balinese dress, go find a remote beach, visit spiritual temples, go to a surf beach, go to an exclusive restaurant, go to a Balinese locals restaurant, learn to surf... plus even things I didn't know I wanted to do until he showed me, like make offerings out of palm branches.. you get the picture... Check check and check. He was patient, kind and friendly.. waited when I wanted to go explore by myself, but not too far when I'd had enough and was ready to go home.. Available when I wanted a buddy to explore with and learn about the culture.. Highly recommend, worth every penny. will use everytime I go to Bali."

The experience was very good and enjoyable, which is always important when thinking on spending 4-5hours on the car. Wayan knows very well Bali, and he seemed to be able to avoid traffic quite succesfuly, which in south Bali are quite bad. The last thing I will say is that us travelling with three children where very happy by the feeling of safety that we had during the whole 5 days, being traffic quite hectic we never had a moment of stress."

I contacted him before we arrived to arrange everything and he kindly provided recommendations that made our itinerary better. He is a very genuine and modest person, very knowledgeable about Bali and it was clear that he was very happy to share his culture with us. He offered water and cold towels after we climbed the many steps down and up when we visited a waterfall and that was very thoughtful of him. He avoided touristy places and recommended cheaper places to eat. When we offered him lunch he said that his wife had prepared lunch for him and it would be rude not to eat it. We thought that was very sweet. During one of the trips I did not feel well and he drove us back to where we stayed really fast (you have to be aware that no one usually drives fast in Bali so this was very much appreciated). We really enjoyed our time in Bali and we learned a lot from Wayan so if you need a knowledgeable and honest driver in Bali do not hesitate to contact him."

He took us on tours to the volcano and art village as well as the ocean and a number of other day trips. When we went whitewater rafting, he negotiated a lower price for us that actually saved us more money for that one attraction than his driving cost for the entire day. Suka speaks excellent English, is familiar with the entire island, and also can help you acquire a SIM card to use your phone locally. During hot day trips he was thoughtful enough to bring along cold towels and water bottles in the ice box of his car."

Early in the morning we went to some real markets away from all the tourism and even experienced the true local lifestyle while we visited a completely foreign family in their house. For me it was the moment when I realized how friendly and completely different bali's people are.Furthermore we had the chance to hike along rice fields and at the end of our day we drove up to mount Agung enjoyed the view of a big lake and a volcano ( sorry, i forgot the names). Finally we arrived in Pura Besakih which was despite the reviews on tripadvisor an amazing temple and because of our licensed tourist guide Wayan Suka not a single person touched or bothered us.The best thing about all is that Wayan Suka planed the whole trip for us. But if you wish he will drive you where ever you want.As a person he was really friendly, always smiling and happy to show and tell you things...a real friend on the tour!He is a real balinese who can show you all the secrets of his culture. By far more than just a driver and worth every single cent and much more!Highly recommended to everyone!Thank you for that great day,Tim & Anne"

We told him roughly what we'd like to see and eat and he was able to plan a comfortable relaxing itinerary for us, including lunch on the mountain overlooking volcano, dinner on the beach watching sunset and simple street food. He even prepared lunch with cold towels & drinks when we were in excursions where food was not readily available.He was also able to take us to good foreign exchange offices where locals exchange the money (with excellent rate, much better than the airport) and how to avoid tourist traps in one of the temples. He is also very passionate and knowledgable about the culture of Bali. We experience not just the beautiful sceneries but also the culture, history and religion of Bali.We highly recommend using Wayan to experience Bali."

He has a good car, is an excellent driver, speaks good English (plus some other languages), and is passionate and knowledgeable about the culture of Bali. He is also very moderately priced. He will take you on back roads if you want, show you rice fields, temples, a village, a silver smith, shopping, whitewater rafting, volcanos ...or whatever. He is from the village of Kedewatan just to the west of Ubud, but will travel anywhere ... and will guide you, or wait for you if you prefer. For his contacts, and website, see http://amansukatour.com/ He is also on facebook - search on Wayan Suka Aman means safe and Suka means like, or sweet.He will also transport you to or from the airport if that's all you need."
