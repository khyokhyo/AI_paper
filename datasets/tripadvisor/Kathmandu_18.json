You'll be approached by licensed guides after you pay at the ticket window. Use one of the guides. Their knowledge is amazing, and you'll get more from the experience. Make sure they have a license. If you ask how much, they'll tell you to decide at the end. We chose to pay $US20. We had great service."

It is also worthwhile just stopping at a street corner to people watch, never a dull moment. And so many photographic opportunities. Find out before if there are any ceremonies taking place, they are a must. Official guides are a must !"

I'd visited to Durbar Square opposite to the old royal palaces in Nepal, consists of temples, idols, open courts, water fountains, etc. Before the Unification of Nepal, there were small kingdoms, and Durbar Squares are most prominent remnants of those old kingdoms in Nepal.In particular, three Durbar Squares in the Kathmandu Valley, belonging to the three Newar kingdoms situated there before unification, are most famous: Kathmandu Durbar Square, Patan Durbar Square, and Bhaktapur Durbar Square.All three are UNESCO World Heritage Sites.On April 2015 Nepal had experienced the earthquake with a magnitude of 7.8Mw or 8.1Ms and a maximum Mercalli Intensity of IX (Violent), killed over 8,000 people and injured more than 21,000. A major aftershock occurred on 12 May 2015 at 12:50 NST with a moment magnitude (Mw) of 7.3. It was the worst natural disaster to strike Nepal since 1934 Nepal\u2013Bihar earthquake.Centuries-old buildings were destroyed at UNESCO World Heritage sites including some at Kathmandu Durbar Square, Patan Durbar Square, Bhaktapur Durbar Square, Changu Narayan Temple, Boudhanath stupa and the Swayambhunath Stupa.Although some are renovated, evidently many more remained as crumbled ruins."

If you need to choose between Bhaktapur Durbar square or KTM Durbar square. Bhaktapur is more preserved. We saw our entrance to the place as a donation for the restoration of the earthquake of 2015."

Make sure you do not have leather goods with you carring these is prohibited in the temple's compound. Before entering the place make sure you purchase your entry tag which you have to wear during you visit. For foreigners it is 500 NPR, for locals entry is free of charge. You will see many vendors selling all kind of nick nacks. you will see temples and shrines dating back to the 3rd century.Take a stroll through the side alleys and you will discover a world that stems from the Newari and Tibetan culture, an evidence of spiritual ties forged between Patan ( the district were Durbar square is located )and Tibet through centuries of trade.as you stroll the lanes you will come to the tiny Golden Temple which is not well visited , maybe because it is hidden away almost at the end of Durbar Square. it is the most opulent little temple in Nepal, it is a must visit when in Nepal.Aside of the main temple courtyard ( in the temple gardens ) is the monastery restaurant which i had mentioned early in another review. It looks to tempting with vegetarian and non vegetarian food, moreover what tempted us to have lunch in this restaurant was that all the vegetables & herbs they use in their cooking comes from the monastery's garden. Unfortunately we were very disappointed with the lunch we were served. The vegetable still had soil in them and some other matter perhaps better not to know, we were offered coffee and cake as compensation, but in the end eventually charged for. the intricate artwork in wood or silver of all the buildings and temples is a must see for every visitor to Nepal. You will just stand there in awe and wonder how people at that time were able to do such kind of precise work. Namaste"

I understand that some people are desperate to get income but even after we tried to spend some money, we were simply surrounded by even more people trying to sell. Its a sad situation and I guess understandable."

Many of the monuments and buildings have been severely damaged by the 2015 earthquake, and are undergoing restoration. It's a pricey visit considering it's an open air square, and it feels a little unjust to see locals walking through for free while tourists are targeted aggressively and forced to pay 1000 rupee. Almost all squares, monuments and historical sites in Kathmandu attract entry fees, but most are only around 100-300 rupee, so 1000 felt like a big sting considering apart from viewing the monuments, there isn't a lot on offer. My hope is that the fees for entry go toward the restoration effort, but I definitely can't confirm that, and can only hope for the best in people."

My advice would be to skip Durbar and go directly to Bhaktapur which is very similar but more interesting with less hassle (there is still hassle there! but less) Or visit a restaurant overlooking Durbar so you can see the buildings without having to deal with all the shenanigans below."

Kathmandu\u2019s square is larger than the other two and it has suffered far more damage from the 2015 earthquake with virtually every building scaffolded or prompt up. A couple of the buildings including the 12th century temple Kasthamandap were totally devastated. We travelled to the square in a mini bus and had to walk the remaining 200 metres down a muddy road as the bus couldn't enter the square- but cars, motor cycles and scooters could, making for a somewhat manic journey and a seemingly continuous noise of horns and the need to regularly move to one side. The sheer chaos to me spoilt the religious worship that was ongoing in the various temples can on the square. Entry to the square is 1000 Nepalese dollars (around \u00a36.50) for tourists which goes to refurbishment, but with the amount of work needed this will take many, many years even with the necessary will and money being available. One other negative of the square was the annoyingly aggressive nature of the street traders who just wouldn't leave you alone, the square was the only place we'd experienced this during our complete tour of Nepal."

It has an amazing collection of historical buildings: temples, a museum, palace, markets and in-between amazing sculptures, mostly in stone but also in wood. Much of this was ruined and the present situation is one of chaos, derelict buildings, remains. There is still beauty to be seen, as well as erotic wooden sculpture on one of the temples and a huge display of Kali, the God of revenge. But the markets have gone, the pyramidal structure is in ruins, the museum is closed. The entrance fee is still levied (keep the ticket and come back the next day!), and it's good to contribute money for restoration. But there is a long way to go. The open-air market of trinkets, bells, games, puppets is still there (bargaining compulsory, check the very mediocre quality and don't believe anything is old), but it lacks life."

The first feeling, and a quite overwhelming one when entering the compound, is one of sadness as you compare the current cityscape with the one shown in the beautiful pictures taken before the earthquake. The sight of debris and wooden posts is everywhere, but the place is still a charming one, especially if weather helps with a beautiful sunshine.A mandatory stop is at the Kumari ghar, the house of Living Goddess, where you will be told the story of how a girl is identified by a committee of elders as a living goddess when she is 3, and must leave the position to a younger girl before she reaches puberty. The building where the goddess lives can be partially visited, with a beautiful courtyard whose walls are enriched with elegant elaborate wooden carvings.I was lucky enough to visit Durbar Square while the first of the Newari traditional \u2018barha\u2019 wedding ceremonies was being held, where 3~4 year-old girls were being married to the wood apple, a fruit produced by a tree native to India. They will be married again (to the sun, this time) before they are 12, and only after then they can get married to a man. The main point is to avoid that they are identified as widows if their husband dies prematurely, thus sparing them the related disadvantages within the traditional Nepalese society.Can only wish that this beautiful place is restored to the traditional splendour as soon as possible."

You cannot help but imagine that fully restoring the many buildings in the square will take at least a decade. It will be a long time, but small ticket sale price that all tourists pay go towards the restoration process, so I encourage you to have a look and contribute to the rebuilding process. We had an excellent guide who explained the many different buildings are their purposes: I would thoroughly recommend a guide as we got so much more out of it as a result, although they do give you quite a useful pamphlet with your ticket purchase."

There is a kiosk at at least one main entrance though I entered the main square seemingly bypassing it (not intentionally). The square is quite large and again there quite a few temples a lot of which are in ruins, unfortunately. There are a lot of stalls. There are the monks. When I went there was some sort of ritual going on because 2 goats were being killed and skinned in the Square itself. I would probably say it is worth getting a guide to explain everything that's going on, otherwise you are walking round like myself clueless as to to history behind the buildings.

The brochure shows the temples before they were destroyed so its hard to know what you're looking at. I was solo and was easily targeted by the 'local guides' this guy had an honest face so I let him show me around for an hour. We agreed on $15usd beforehand, it felt short and when I gave him $20usd because I was feeling bad for him he imposed I should have given him $35. Ridiculous. I really didn't have the money to spend and I wish I hadn't. I would have been better off reading about everything in my Lonely Planet book. Beware of these types of people, they often have deals with the shops and try to get you to buy stuff as well. Karma. If you want to donate to a cause find a local non-profit instead."

I first visited Kathmandu in the late 1990s and we use to routinely visit Durbar Square to see the various Malla and Shah Royal Palaces, showing exceptional Newari craftsmanship. They however remained fairly dilapidated, but were well used by local people and tourists brought money by buying trinkets, visiting restaurants and coffee shops and going to Freak Street. I think it was about 2007 that World Heritage status was granted, but this resulted in tourists being charged to visit the square. This is fine, but over the years the charge has increased so much that it became prohibitive for those going to Kathmandu on a regular basis. What has been most upsetting is that over the years there has been little evidence of the money being spent on the actual site, so it has remained dilapidated. It was therefore a shock to see the extensive damage inflicted by the 2015 Earthquake on this world Heritage site. I could have wept at the loss of such old and beautiful craftsmanship, but even more shocking was the fact that we were forced to pay Rs1000 to see what is now mostly a pile of rubble and severely damaged buildings. Some scaffolding has gone up, but very little has been done since the Earthquake to repair the damage. Years of tourist money has been mismanaged/wasted/pilfered and still it is the same old problem; take the money but do nothing with it. This is an utter disgrace. Even though the rest of the world donated \u00a34.1 billion to Nepal, it is hard to see what has been done with the money. It certainly hasn't been spent on Durbar Sq!I cannot recommend that tourists visit this important World Heritage site as they are being over charged. I feel that tourists have been ripped off for may years and more so now."

Tons of motorcycles whizzing by and sometimes a group of tourists would literally trample me as they stampeded by. A lot of interesting sights but i couldn't tell what was what and generally disoriented and not brave enough to take on a guide. I had some bad experiences with guides in Morocco who are basically con men, inflating the price and then screaming at you to pay and this turned me off the guide option. However, in retrospect i may have done well to have had a guide. As it was , i was left staring respectfully at various piles of stones and temples without knowing what i was looking at. Nothing is really well labeled and the occasional Sadhu i spoke to didn't speak English. Will have to do more research next time before going."

It will take years to recover, Surely tourists who have enough money to travel to Nepal can afford a small fee towards helping this recovery.

Moreover, it does not feel particularly safe being around the remaining buildings. A few locals like some of the stall holders there were complaining to us about the fact that not much has been done in the past year by the government, despite the high entrance fees and the international aid given to Nepal.

But it's not worth paying to see any of the structures. The awful security tail you and yell at you to ask for your ticket. You can explain you're just walking through, and sometimes they'll let you, but most times they'll make you take a different route in a back alley. Locals are free, but tourists have to pay. I understand the concept, if you're visiting the sites. But this is a square in the middle of 3 major shopping areas so many people walk through. As a local that has been living here paying taxes, it is very annoying and rude to be constantly tailed and asked to pay just to walk through when other locals do not have to pay. The major temples were demolished in the earthquake and there is not much to see here in regards to the remaining temples. It's not worth paying 1000 rupees so go to Bhaktapur instead. The entry fee there is 1500 rupees, but well worth it to see 4 squares and many more buildings that are nicer and grander. The town of Bhaktapur itself is charmingly quaint and old. You feel like you're walking through a 1500s novel with the old water wells still in use. Most of the surrounding buildings are original old houses as well, so photos will be better there than in Kathmandu's durbar square which is small and crowded and surrounded by concrete buildings."

But it's worth getting one, otherwise you have no idea what you're looking at. We managed to get a great guide Kumar who we managed to get for 700Rs for the two of us. We was very knowledgable and it wouldn't have been anywhere near as interesting without him. The earthquake has damaged a far bit of the square, but it was still very beautiful and interesting."

In all honesty I wasn't all that impressed, Possibly due to the fact that it was my first day in Kathmandu and I got continuously hassled by this one guide trying to sell me a guided tour of the square, when in reality I just wanted to wander by myself and have a look round and take some pictures. I wasn't all that bothered that I might have missed some amazing historical fact or whatever, or that I wouldnt know what a particular shrine or temple was for. This guide in perticular started off at 4000 roupees and over the course of the hour or two I was in durbar square proceeded to keep coming back to me multiple times with lower offers eventually getting down to 500, which by that time it was starting to get dark and I Just left I was that fed up with him. I had actually extended my ticket for two days so I could come back tomorrow (which you can do for free in their ticket office) But I couldnt face any more hasstle from this guy lol!Anyway Durbar square is a fairly interesting collection of old temples, stupas and fallen down buildings, you have to pay 1000 rupees to get in, if you've got time to spare go and have a look round as its not to far from Thamel. If you're short on time and its a toss up between this and the Monkey temple however go see the monkey temple, its much better and the guides were nowhere near as annoying ."

I had spent 2 months here pre-earthquake. I just returned to KTM in January, 2016. I now live here.Inaccurate, and disturbing, hyper-drama news reporting said Kathmandu was leveled. It was not. Kathmandu Durbar Square was not leveled. Yes, there was major damage at this site, many people died. I watched locals live, cooking, sleeping - in the open spaces at this site - but I am positively delighted at what did NOT fall down and can be still deeply experienced.I STRONGLY suggest that you do NOT hire a guide through this area (they will high-pressure you) and that you move slow - take your time - engage your own brain, eyes, feelings - let your camera record. Guides talk non-stop - you want the FEEL of this ancientness - not get slaughtered by their FACTS. With someone's mouth constantly in motion - you will surely miss it. For the history - read the guidebook before or after your visit.There is a hefty entrance fee of 1000 rupees ($10) but it is good for the length of your visa. If you have time to visit more than once - at different times of day you will see different things going on. This square is packed with locals - an earthquake did not make it stop being their treasure trove. They just started to shovel and sweep and clean it up.There are many places to sit - hang out - watch how everyone else does it. Engage a local street seller in conversation - ask them where they were at earthquake time - these quiet, native people love to interact with foreigners. Ask them to order a sweet, yummy tea for you (20 rupees) - offer to buy them one - then watch how it arrives and where it comes from. They have beautiful things to sell you but if they know you just want to talk with them they are most obliging and will be as curious about you as you are about them.Check out the magnificent Telaju Temple - observe locals doing ritual worship in the several small temples around this large square. You can still walk through the ground-level area of the palace which will give you a good idea of what ancient palace life.was like.Wander the open air market of Basantapur. The historical, hippie culture, Freak Street is adjacent to it with its tatoo parlors, hookah pipe shops, coffee houses, cafes. Have a Lavazza coffee. Or an excellent Americano at Himalayan Java. Have lunch in one of the many rooftop cafes that dot the square. Wander off down side streets, you will not be disappointed.Everything here is alive and well. If you try to complete this site in 1 or 2 hours you will be the loser. Guaranteed.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."

It has been significantly damaged - some pagodas were reduced entirely to rubble - but I still really enjoyed hearing about the history and meaning of the buildings and representations of deities. One of the highlights for us was seeing the Kumari girl, who represents a goddess in human form (need to pay a little extra for her to come to the window, and you can't photograph her). The touts were quite bad here, following us around, so I think it would probably be better early/late in the day. Relatively expensive (for Nepal) at NRS1000 for foreigners (but in my opinion, worth it)."

After talking to locals it appeared that perhaps not much, if at all, any went toward this... Only tourists paid the charge even though home nation visitors were requested to pay 150 rupees! Whilst walking around it was devastating to see the damage the earthquake caused. The temples were incredible and well worth the sight however the whole time you were in the square you were either hassled by tour guides, beggars or market holders.. It wasn't possible to stand and read the plaques next to the temples for more than a few seconds without being grabbed by children or beggars! Post earthquake I can imagine these temples were even more amazing, hopefully in the future they can be repaired and conserved for future visitors. Walking around the backstreets of Kathmandu and finding hidden temples was far less hassle and still as interesting! If you can spare the charge and ignore bustle it's certainly worth a visit!"

We visited it at around 11 am in late December and were amazed to see the beautiful architecture (a mix of Indian and east Asian influences), the locals soaking up the sun and the tourists gawking at everything! :) Facts: SAARC citizens have to pay 100 NPR as entrance fees and non-SAARC citizens a little more. This was the norm in most tourist spots that we visited in Nepal. The earthquake damage is not quite as bad in the Bhakatapur Durbar Square (as per our guide). Wooden supports have been placed under the ancient structures and one old temple's top has completely collapsed and is being re-constructed now. Other than this, everything was intact. TIP: Do wander around and visit the temple (if you are a Hindu). Do visit the restaurant in the museum bldg; it has a lovely ambience, a good view, delicious food and a clean toilet. DO visit the painting/art shops near the end of the Durbar Square; look for the painting shop no. 2/3 on the left-hand side. Negotiate and DO BUY from there. We saw artists pain-painstakingly working on the minute details in the shop. They need your support. And really, the prices are a real bargain!"

Paris, you can describe it. It's archetypal. London, it makes sense. But Kathmandu, I think someone once said, is an absurd city. Not only did I come to Kathmandu with no reference points, making it utterly alien to me.  I also had the special honor of seeing Durbar Square as the guest of one of the former Kumari girls who are chosen from special families to be living goddesses in Kathmandu and two other cities. She is now 25 and was a Kumari for a few years. Please read up on these special youth. Ganga B. now works as the assistant manager of the World Heritage Apartments and Hotel, which is connected by a small passageway to the Durbar Square, right behind what used to be the Krishna Temple, which was completely destroyed after the 2015 earthquake. She suggested we have dinner at a small restaurant on the square. We set out at night, after all the vendors had gone home (except one), and all the pigeons had gone to sleep. The place looked slightly abandoned. The cool mist of late December was falling into the city. The electricity had been cut. We walked by a painting vendor who was closing shop, you could make out the paintings inside from the glow of a single light bulb powered by a car battery. Ganga suggested that we go in, just to look. After sitting down with the vendor, he explained to me the karmic cycle of Buddhist life, and we selected a tonka together, which I bought, and will hang in my office. We negotiated. I got a fair price, and came away with a rolled up tonka describing the three causes of pain and suffering, and the god that looks over us all and decides if we go to heaven or hell. Hint: the secret is in balancing spirituality with desire. Walking around the square at night, Ganga brushing against me and talking about her love for the mysterious darkness overtaking the city, really empties the mind of distractions. We walked all around the square and then snaked our way outside of the square down dozens of alleys with absolutely no lighting. It turned out that this was the eve of the Garung caste's new year (garung is a type of caste that lives in Nepal, and they celebrate New Year's Eve on January 30), fires dotting the grounds, and people wearing glow in the dark devil's horns on their heads. All of this gave the city a mysterious quiet. I looked at the shells of the buildings and former temples. They seemed animated, like the haunted houses in a Disney film, looming over our heads in the super close alleys and streets. It was like walking through a labyrinth. The earthquake has made the inside and the outside of the square look abandoned and torn down. Many roofs are hanging lopsided off the sides of the buildings. Large beams are pushing up the falling walls. It's a combination of war zone and peaceful, community square. And that night, as temperatures got lower, and people left the streets to sleep or to sit inside and make fires, I thought that maybe the royal family is gone, but they have left behind a kind of temple to the reality of the present moment. A city swirling with chaos that in a moment can become quite, still and filled with possibility."

The central area - where the large stepped foundations of the temples would be filled with people - now, with no temples on the foundations, have just a few stragglers, who are periodically chased away by policemen. The square is just as noisy but without the old purposeless purpose.There seems to have been no restoration work done but I was informed by one of the locals that there are Chinese engineers designing support for building that were damaged but not destroyed. One interesting - although cynical - development is that there are now signs with photos and descriptions at some of the temples that were destroyed, whereas before there were temples but no signs.There is also access that wasn't available in the past. You can, for example, stand on the foundation of the Kasthamandap Temple to view and photograph, from an angle previously impossible, the small and dilapidated-looking Ashok Binayak Temple. You can climb to the top of the Trailokya Mohan Narayan Temple to view and photograph a magnificent stone Shiva-Parvati sculpture which likely was previously buried in the innards of the temple. In Nasal Chowk, enclosed within the palace, have been accumulated struts and other wooden objects with intricate carvings that are easily viewable, whereas before they would have been high on the temple. It's not a silver lining but makes a visit as worthwhile as before although for different reasons. Entry fee is about $10 but, if you're staying in town for while and expect to visit Durbar Square multiple times, you can get a pass for the duration of your stay - be sure to have a passport style photograph for them."

Huge lengths of timber are propped up against the walls of numerous buildings in a bid to offer some support. Even though some temples and buildings have been removed, the remaining ones still give the visitor a feel for the history of these beautiful buildings. My daughter who was having her first trip to Nepal was so impressed with the buildings and the various designs. She had no reference point to compare to so I kept quite about how good they used to look and let her find things for herself. So, if a 19 year old can look at Durbar Square and still see the beauty in the history of the place, then every one should still go, pay the 1000R and enjoy the place. The money you pay could help restore one of the buildings to its former glory or just allow work to be done to prevent it from falling altogether."

The houses, the pretty frescos, the tiny little carvings on every building, the entire ancient layout, the friezes that suddenly appear on every corner and take your breath away.. it was all worth the day that I spent there. The carvings that decorated the temples were finely carved. The bazaar street was lined with people teeming and there were all sorts of things that you won't expect, like excellent restaurants inside the tunnel of carved wood, a little garden in an isolated place and a small class where they taught how to make those lovely intricate buddhist paintings. I hope they can remake it... in all of its glory!!"

Very vibrant with tourists and locals alike (just beware of these quite \"persistent\" sellers & guides especially if you're a single person!), this fairly big area adjacent to Thamel (just about a ten-minute walk south from the small Chetrapati roundabout which is pretty much at the heart of Thamel) is one place that I would say no tourist should leave Kathmandu without going to!! :) On the west side of the square and stretching from north to south are temples with beautiful red cloth trims hanging down around the roofs and the steps by which you could go up (but cannot actually go inside the temples once you got above); be sure to look up the temple with two big sculptures of lions in front and you'll see two statue figures looking out from a window!On the south side are the three-story residence of Hindu Goddess Kumari (with an inner courtyard) and Kasthamandap (with about four levels and it was like the ONLY temple on the square that people can go inside on the first level, but sadly I heard that temple was destroyed in the earthquake). On the east side of the square (you have to go around to the back area by turning left from the front area if you enter from the north coming down from Thamel) is Hanuman Dhoka Palace with its nine-story Basantapur Tower with great views from above (toward the west, you can see the Swayambhunath hill with the Stupa above); and on the ground around the palace courtyard are displays of some royal things including a carriage and a pretty decorated big chair (which I guess was sat on by the king) behind the glass on one side and portraits of the kings of Nepal (in the chronological order) on another side (the side just to the left of the courtyard entrance). Also be sure to check out the back courtyard where there are intricate-designed columns on the ground supporting the structures above with slanted windows (they're on the front side of the palace too, and you look out through the holes on their covers when you go up the Basantapur Tower) which is probably a \"unique\" Nepalese style since I haven't seen that type of window anywhere else that I've travelled.The only \"loss\" for me at the Square when I visited was that the big Degu Taleju Temple at the back area right beside Hanuman Dhoka had its gates closed for some reason, so I could only view it from outside.And I'm personally glad to hear that the Basantapur Tower here survived the earthquake although it's sad to hear Dharahara (Bhimsen Tower) about a 20-minute walk south from here (go out the south side, walk straight for about 15 minutes, then turn left and about a 5-minute walk) came down, but I hope they'll keep what's left of the tower the way it is."

More accurately the Hanuman-Dhoka Durbar Square, the royal palace sits amidst several temples, idols, open courts and the like. The term \"Durbar Square\" is a generic name used to refer to plazas or open areas opposite the old Nepali royal palaces. Kathmandu's royal palace gets its name from the stone idol of \"Hanuman\", the Hindu monkey god, that sits near the main entryway. ('Dhoka' means door in Nepali.)PROS: Proximity to the city centre is a big asset. It seems like the entire city was built around the site. It took the better of a 30-min walk from our Fuji Hotel, unless you get lost along the way. But everyone knows where it is. The ticket booth provides a handy guide map.CONS: Double-standard entry fees aside, as a fundraising bid for the restoration of the damaged structures, the entry fees have been increased from NRs750 then up to NRs 1,000 now. (SAARC fees remain the same.) You will still need a map and/or a guide. Photography is still not allowed inside the Tribhuvan Museum, for which temporary lockers are set up at the entrance. WCs (toilets) are few and hard to find inside, but there's a couple between Dhak Chowk and Lam Chowk (accessed through Nasal Chowk) (Note: Bring toilet paper, just in case.)UPDATE: As of this writing, the April 2015 earthquake (and subsequent aftershocks) dealt considerable damage to many structures in Durbar Square. Among those that sustained damage were the Maju Dega, Kamdev Temple, Trailokya Mohan Narayan Temple, the upper floors of the Basantapur Durbar, etc. Surviving structures have been propped up by wooden poles. Further away, the white Dharahara (or Bhinsen) Tower was reduced to its base. However, by July 2015, the UNESCO decided not to put Durbar Square in its Danger List of Monuments. Hence, tourism still resumes albeit at about half the number of visitors.Verdict: Worth a visit. Even as the rubble have been carted away and the dust has settled, a trip to Kathmandu -- even for a passing trekker -- would not be complete without seeing this iconic Nepali landmark. Grade A-minus.."

I visited Basantapur. I have been there before and the damage post earthquake is significant. A lot of temples (?) have been destroyed and Only a few of the old architecture remain standing. A lot of the old buildings have wooden stilts or some sort to support the leaning structures. I did not have a guided tour so I did not learn much about the area. Surrounding the area are shops aplenty. Walking through the little alleys, you tend to worry that if an earthquake aftershock were to take place, where will you run to as there are still a great amount of old buildings leaning precariously. I guess tourists can still see some architecture as well as experience the destruction left by the recent earthquake as there has been much rebuilding since. I'm unsure about entrance fees and costs as I did not need to pay."

This is one of the most beautiful pedestrian only zones we visited in Nepal showcasing ancient temples, palace and handicraft stores all around. Kathmandu Durbar Square in front of the old royal palace of the former Kathmandu Kingdom is one of three Durbar Squares in the Kathmandu Valley all of which are UNESCO World Heritage Sites. It has palaces of the Malla and Shah kings who ruled over the city. Along with these palaces, the square surrounds quadrangles, revealing courtyards and temples. It is known as Hanuman Dhoka Durbar Square, a name derived from a statue of Hanuman, the monkey devotee of Lord Ram, at the entrance of the palace."

Some of the temples and shrines have been totally reduced to rubble, but many others have suffered only \"minor\" damage and are still to be seen in all their glory. The palace complex is still intact (with much use of structural bracing) and there are many places to still get lost in. Tourist numbers are down by about 80%, so you'll have much of the place to yourself. Here's a tip, once you have your ticket, go to the site office (ask if you can't find it) and get a long term pass, it will be valid for your whole time in Nepal, that way you can come to the Durbar on multiple visits, you'll need to bring your passport and a passport size photo and there is no extra charge, great value.

This complex, at the very heart of the ancient city of Kathmandu, is known also as \"Basantapur Durbar Square\" or \"Hanuman-Dhoka Square\", including palaces and beautiful temples and shrines, both Hindu and Buddhist. The April 25, 2015 earthquake has severely damaged \"Durbar Square\", where many temples and monuments - as \"Kasthamandap\", \"Maju Dega\", \"Chyasin Dega\", \"Trilokya Mohan Narayan\" and others - were completely destroyed. But fortunately, many others like \"Kumari Chowk\", \"Shiva Parvati\", \"Taleju\", \"Basantapur Durbar\", \"Hanuman-Dhoka Palace\" and \"Gaddi Baithak\" were partially or slightly damaged. Before the earthquake, \"Durbar Square\" was always full of visitors, souvenir sellers, fake saddhus, pigeons and cows. The square has re-opened for visitors and a fee of Rs.750,00 is charged per person upon entry. If visiting Nepal was on your plans, don't give it up! Visiting Nepal is a form of supporting the country's reconstruction efforts. Enjoy!"

Of course Kathmandu's Durbar Square has the advantage of being only a ten-fifteen minute walk south from Thamel, where most people stay when visiting Kathmandu. (The entry fee of 500Rs - about 5$ and rumoured to be going up to 750Rs - might put the budget traveller off.) However, the walk through Asaan, the bazaar district that lies between Thamel and Durbar Square is definitely not to be missed.

What's worse, maybe, is that part way through the tour they take you to this \"art school\" where they sit you down and pressure you to buy these mandalas. They were laying down the sales pitch so hard that it was extremely uncomfortable and I wanted to run away. I'd say just avoid the guided tour altogether."

A wonderful collection of ancient buildings which are incorporated into locals' daily lives; whether it is worshipping at the shrines, sitting on the steps to monuments chatting with friends, selling and buying produce. Even the touts did not manage to detract from the atmosphere (well, mostly).In June, following the quake, it was very different. It is open and safe (if one is sensible) and most of the rubble is gone. Unfortunately, major buildings are also gone. Chief among these is Kasthamandap, the oldest and the highest of the pagoda-style buildings which gave the name to Kathmandu and is reputed to have been made from a single tree is nothing but the stone base and steps.Some pagodas, monuments and shrines remain and the visit was worth it if only to see the damage and how the resilient Kathmandu-ites are stoically returning to normality. Rebuilding will take place but will take a long time. Whether the magic can be restored remains to be seen."

Durbar Square in the heart of old Kathmandu city in Basantapur never fails to impress first time visitors with its intricate wood carvings and rich history. Surrounded by concrete buildings, the complex is an oasis in a fast developing, chaotic modern city. Once the residence of Nepal's Royal family, all coronation ceremonies were held here. The palace is an amalgamation of eastern and western architecture with additions by Rana and Shah rulers over the centuries. An unbelievable 50 temples lie within the vicinity including the temple of the titular deity, Taleju Bhawani. The Durbar is divided into two courtyards, the outer Kasthamandap, Kumari Ghar, and Shiva-Parvati Temple, and the inner section consisting of Hanuman Dhoka and the main palace. Some floors have been converted to museums dedicated to three generations of Shah kings. Most parts of the palace premises are open to tourists throughout the week. Some important monuments to see in this area are: The Taleju Temple is the tallest of all structures, built by King Mahendra Malla in 1549 AD. This temple is open to the public for one day each year during the Dashain festival. The Jagannath Temple, built in the 16th century is known for the fascinating erotic figures carved on the wooden struts.The Kal Bhairav, one of the largest 17th century stone statues in Kathmandu, representing the terrifying aspect of Lord Shiva. Swet-Bhairav - the temple is open to the public once in year during Indra Jatra Festival. The 17th century Kumari Temple (the temple of Living Goddess) is an example of highly developed Nepali craftmanship. Kaandasthamp, from which Kathmandu derives its name, is said to have been built from the timber of a single tree.Nautalle Durbar (the nine storyed palace)"

We had an amazing Nepali breakfast overlooking the square."

A section is given over to emergency tents; people zip through bits of square not cordoned off on bikes; every temple or building shows signs of damage, and some are totally flattened. But life, and tourism, goes on. 750 rupees foreigner entry seems steep given the museum is closed, but it's going towards rebuilding heritage buildings, so we were happy to pay."

Allow an hour or two, to absorb the atmosphere, and to get your moneys worth, as foreigners are charged a lot to get in. Make sure you read a guide book, so you understand what you're seeing, to avoid the \" just another old building/temple\" syndrome. The Wikipedia page is very detailed. The highlight? The Hanuman Statue is memorable. The palaces are good. Look for the elaborate carvings on the windows. The Kumari, is my favourite, first seen when I was there 35 years ago, and still there today: a young girl, highly decorated, who appears for a minute at a window, with the alcove below packed with observers. No photos allowed. She's a human incarnation of Durga, a Hindu mother goddess. Get to the entrance at least 20 minutes before 4pm, and stand inside, so you can see her window. Don't get stuck behind a shrub! (Personally, if you're going to see just one Durbar Square, then I'd recommend the one in Bhaktrapur, which is further out of central Kathmandu, but has a much more \"living history\" feel to it. Costs more to get there (we had a day rental taxi, so I don't know if there is a bus), BUT if you ask for your passport details to be put on your ticket, you can re-enter for free for seven days. This is useful if there's a festival on)."

Nothing had been cleared up yet, and people were still more or less in shock. Wandering around, sitting around forlornly. Garuda looked out upon rubble, The grand neo-classical buildings had lost their ruffles, and the are bricks were showing. The ancient Newar palace of the Malla kings was badly disheveled. People were just beginning to camp out in the square. Only the Kumari Temple looked perfectly intact, while Taleju suffered less damage than some of the others, and at least the pagodas still stood out against the blue sky. On that day, i couldn't take any more and didn't go to the Dharara Tower until about a week later."

It will cost you 250rp or around $AUD3.50 and also includes a map which is a \"must have\" but do not expect to get a copy in your preferred language. We were given the French guide because that was all they had. You will most certainly have a bevy of guides offering to show you around. Not sure what this costs but in hindsight I would recommend you barter hard and take up this offer. Check the guide has an official looking guide pass. All signage is in Nepalese. The area is the old palace and is fascinating with its many temples and palace buildings with intricate carved wooden inlay work around windows, doors and eaves. While in need of massive restoration it is nevertheless incredible in size and construction. Your entry also entitles you to visit some parts of the palace grounds and the museum. Visiting the museum actually gets you inside the palace which is fascinating and houses a collection of photos, clothing, regalia, etc from one of the more recent Kings of Nepal. There is much to be discovered but unless you are well read on Nepalese culture, traditions, history and religion much of the significance of many of the sites is lost on the average tourist. I certainly include myself in this comment. Government of Nepal needs to explain what the process/plan is for the restoration and upkeep of the areas - money is being collected and needs to be wisely spent to ensure this magnificent treasure is looked after. The other great reason to visit Durbar Square is it does allow you to escape the throng of tourists and locals that otherwise flood the surrounding streets along with motorbikes, rickshaws, taxis, buses, cars etc - it is mayhem. Once you have finished your tour you will probably want to head for Thamel - the market area. This is a challenge and I strongly suggest if you have a guide that he takes you back to Thamel and shows you how to get to your hotel."

We visited Durbar Square on a misty day, hence it could have been nicer with clear blue skies appearing in the background of the temples. I really enjoyed visiting the museum of Durbar Square, see the beautiful courtyard surrounded by the stunning Hindu architecture. Nonetheless, I thought there wasn\u2019t much to visit inside the building, several \u201cno entry\u201d signs were hanging in the door frames. Hence, I would have been curious to see a little bit more but didn\u2019t dare to trespass at any point. Once we entered the square I was looking forward to this so called \"pedestrian zone\u201d. Which appeared to be at the beginning. Sadly I was wrong: scooters, and motocycles still drive through. So you have to watch where you\u2019re walking!As well, I found the entry price to this UNESCO site outrageously expensive. Some tourist attractions like boudhanath only ask for 200 NPR. It seems like these Hindu places, like Durbar Square or Pashupatinath tend to rip off tourists by asking them to pay between 750 to 1000 NPR. All in all, not too bad. Just a couple of disappointments."

If you do go it is advised to get a tour guide as we were able to get one for 200 rupees per person and he was definitely worth it. It is not necessary but you wouldn't take in or understand all the fantastic buildings and meanings of the shrines available throughout the square. We returned here at the end of our trip in the hope to see the Kumari. We did after one of the tour guides requested her appearance and were slightly disappointed. We were glad to see her but we were under the impression that she would be made up like the photos and it was an event but the reality was that she was an average young girl who looked bored whilst looking out the window at us before flouncing off once she seemed to have had enough. That said, it was good to have seen her. Definitely worth visiting the square if you're in the are though, and can easily get a bite to eat or drink too."

That way I got to see the real local life minus the touristy hustle bustle. Its so different from Thamel. Freak Street has these tiny shops with remanants of the hippy era, and I almost got a tattoo done the place is so infectous!This place surely doesnt need a guide. All one would need is comfortable shoes, camera and lonely planet. I simply walked around the whole place, visiting the talking to the locals, having coffee alongside hardcore backpackers, trying to avoid getting run over by a bike, watching local people read newpapers on the steps of historical monuments.Best part was to sit at this corner coffee opposite Kastmandap, sipping coffee and watch nepalese way of life.Loved every bit of it."

The place is full of life, sounds and colors. You should definitely visit Kumari palace and if you get there on time you will have a chance to catch a glimpse of a living Goddess. It is not allowed to take photos of Kumari. Unfortunately one of the tourist did not respect it, when we were visiting and the moment he pointed his camera in direction of Kumari she disappeared behind the wooden walls. Visiting Durbar square is also great chance to get to know some history and religion of Nepal, so either take a good guidebook or book a guide. As we booked the whole Nepal trip with Nepal Hiking Team, a local hiking agency, they organized an amazing daily trip in Kathmandu for us. In my opinion, getting to know the history of the buildings and meaning of the monuments adds a lot of value in sightseeing Kathmandu and Durbar square, especially that it is such a different culture than the European one. I can only recommend it."

Pigeons, people and prayer flags this is still the beating heart of the city."

The best thing to happen that afternoon was being approached by one of the army of \"guides\" who began hassling for us to have him as a guide. \"Do you have any more garbage to see ?\" I said sarcastically.... Having no idea what garbage was he offered to show us \"The best Garbage all over Kathmandu !\" We were about to take some photos and a Military Police van stopped right in front of the temples - blocking everyones view - so they could feed the pidgeons. In comparison with the other 2 Durbar squares its poorly maintained smelly crowded and generally litterstrewn. Compared with most other squares in the world its smelly crowded and litterstrewn.

We wandered into the narrow and winding streets of Old Thamel on a hot and humid day by 3pm. The streets were tangled with pedestrians, motorbikes, tuk-tuks, street hawkers and shops, and the air was filled with the honking sounds of vehicles and the smell of spices, dust and gasoline fumes.As people and vehicles came towards us from different directions, I tried to keep a close pace with my friends while captivating all that was evolving around me. While gazing upon the spider web of wires and telephone lines that hovered over the head,Old Thamel is indeed old. The poorly maintained yet still occupied historic architecture seem to be in need of repair. But even with its weathered round dormers, exposed brick walls and battered carved wood windows.With everything happening in front of me, it feels like my camera is not enough to capture the action.This place was really beautiful where we can find the ruins of past glory of Royal Kingdom.A very small area with lost of shops for souvenirs. But more than that, old buildings and narrow streets reflecting historic texture of the town. Buildings are collapsing as there are No funds for restoring them. So do come and see before it is lost.Soon to be heading to Durbarsquare in a whileDurbarsquare,-KathmanduPassing through the old narrow streets of Thamel we reached to a much wider space of fresh air of Durbarsquare.Kathmandu Durbar Square or also known as Basantapur Durbar Square is a huge plaza of courtyards and temples situated in front of what used to be the old royal palace.Durbar Square is the religious and social heart of Kathmandu's old city and is a complex of palaces, temples, shrines, statues and courtyards built between the 12th and 18th centuries by the ancient kings of Nepal. The square is a queer assortment of the old and the new: elaborately carved architectural features and curving roofs provide shelter for cows, beggars and weary tourists; Brahman priests and painted Sadhus perform rituals and pose for photosWe were in a hurry to get our tickets for entry to the palace since it was alraedy 4pm and we hardly had 1 hour to visit the place.You can spend a whole day walking around admiring every corner of the square or you can do as what most couples usually do, climbed a set of stairs, find a spot and quietly admire the picturesque Durbarsquare.The square reminds me of the time when family time is spent outside doing the simplest thing. A snack bought from the street vendor, a corner occupied to pray, to talk, to rest, a child let to play as he please,the pigeons, the beautiful couples around, the sadhus,and the beautiful Nepali ladies.Kathmandu Durbar Square is an obvious place of visit for anyone touring Nepal and I believe that it should be included on the \u201cmust see\u201d not only for its heritage architecture but for the exuding ambiance of happiness from the Nepalese family and friends walking around.Moral of Durbarsquare visit:Nepali girls are really beautiful,Every place has a story to tell check snapsFrom Basantapur Durbar Square we started walking towards one of our friends house near Kathmandu Football stadium.We traveled through the busy rush hour narrow lanes of the crowded paths to our destination near the football stadium where our dinner was arranged .Buildings falling apart. Artists, handicraft pedlars and prettified bicycles,tuk tuks,people awaiting for the evening buses and so on Astha's dad already gave directions how to reach their home from Durbarsquare to their home.We crossed the narrow lanes beside the stadium and finally reached our destination.We were expecting one more friend who was chasing us since last evening from Nepali border Sunauli.Astha and her family live in the apartment of a large three storey block. Dad opened the sliding gate at the entrance from where we went to second floor of the building which is the living room , the rooms were prettyAsthas Mom was busy in the kitchen preparing momos, chicken and few traditional dishes.Over there I was busy discussing the details for our next day travel to Chitwan to Rhino Resort near Bharatpur and the places to visit across there.Once the discussion was over we all went to have our food ,since power was not there we had to follow the small beam of lights.The amount of \u2018load shedding\u2019 hours people there have to cope with is around 12 hours. People have to live through it every day but still the inverter was working.After enjoying our local drink made of rice grains and chat it was time for us to head in for dinner.Every dish was plated to perfection in Newari styleWe enjoyed the warm welcome and gracious hospitality extended to us. What I've enjoyed most, though, is meeting people who have a real interest in food and sharing ideas with them.Met a wonderful Mom & Dad an avid traveler who traveled across the globe shared the experiences , soon another trip to Manasarovar to explore the Himalayas to be planned,One of the best moments in life .There is no love sincerer than the love of food"

Apparently, one of the Kings, after his visit to the UK, fell in love with the architecture here, came back to Nepal and hired a British architect to design this palace for him. This white palace just looks out of place. However, I know that locals are proud of it. I was there right around Indra Jatra so I got to see Kumari on a carriage pulled by lots of strong man starting from this square around the city. It was an amazing event."

Major attractions we visited are:Kumari Temple : Built in 17th century and home to the Living Goddess (considered to be the incarnation of Taleju (Durka)). We were lucky to have the blessings of the goddess. Trilokya Moban Narayan Temple: Built in 16th Century a temple dedicated to Lord Vishnu Kasthamandap: A temple built by using the timber of a single tree. Dedicated lord Ganesh. It was built in 12th Century. Kathmandu inherits it's name from this temple. Taleju Temple: Built by Malla Kings in 15th Century and more than 35 meters tall. It was considered to be the tallest building in Nepal until recent time. Basantapur Durbar: nine story building built in 17th century.It is a very crowded place with local and visitors from all over the world.

A great place to wander and take photos of Nepali atmosphere. You'll also probably find the ubiquitous Sadhus. Supposedly Hindu holy men.

This is Durbar Square!.There are shops on both sides selling variety of things, ranging from shoes, clothes to bronze utensils - even champagne bottle and glasses or vegetables. In between, there are quaint temples which invariably draw attention with hundreds of candles lit in front of them. The buildings where the shops are running are old and some of them have beautiful carving and interesting architecture. After every 200 metres you can spot small shops selling authentic buff momos or some other local food.One lanes leads to another and kind of create a labyrinth. Walking in these lanes I ended up in an area full of beads' shops. There were necklaces of colourful beads, which the Nepalese brides wear as a custom, were eye catching. This area is worth taking a stroll at to taste the real Kathmandu."

Paid Rs 7500 entrance fee and was given a brochure.Spent some time figuring out the names of the temples ( numbered in the brochure ) using the directional map provided. If there is a plaque bearing the number at each temple, it would facilitate cross referencing with the brochure.Defintely don't need a guide if research was done prior to visiting."

I wouldn't say it was worth it overall as there wasn't much to do other than walk around the old town streets, which are just more shops. The only aspect that is better than the streets of Thamel is that it's less busy with less vehicles on the road. You could actually walk around the streets without worrying as much that a car would honking at your or almost hitting you! We mainly spent our time trying all of the different steamed momo shops around the town! Overall, if you have limited time in Kathmandu this would be one that could be missed."

He finished the tour at an art school and after trying unsuccessfully for 20 minutes for us to buy something, when we left he turned cold and pretty much told us to go back inside and buy and guilt us into it, he then said the tour was done and upped his price and told me to pay 3500 rupees. When I said we had agreed on 2500, he told me that was the \"on season\" price. I tried to get out of it and told him that was very expensive, especially for an hour tour and that I got paid less than that per hour back in Australia and that I only had 2500rupees on me (which I did- I had nothing else at all) he WALKED me to the atm. My advice is if you want a tour guide, even if you talk about and agree on a price, pay them then and there and don't wait until the end."

It'll be a thousand times more interesting than just going there and looking at all the temples without knowing a thing about it. Some of the highlights are:-Kumari house (Kumari Ghar)-Kasthamandap (Kathmandu is named after this wooden building)-The sculpture of Lord Shiva and his consort Parvati- The Golden doorway to Hanuman Dhoka Palace"

The palace itself is not all that impressive, while the museum housed in it was a disappointment;. After walking around the first floor, which displays only photographs of King Tribhuvan and a few of his son, we gave the upper floors a miss as the circular wooden stairs looked too forbidding for our senior citizen legs.The stone steps around the palace are surprisingly high for a country where the people tend to be rather short.Besides the handicraft vendors there are a number of restaurants where you can have a bite and watch the world go by. The Himalayan Java Coffee shop was our favorite.Since we were from a SAARC country, we got a substantial discount on the entry ticket."

It's also a concentration of beggars and touts, mostly selling the same mass-produced knock-offs you find everywhere in Kathmandu--though, looking carefully, you might find something good. It's worth spending a few minutes at the main office to convert your 200 NR entrance fee into a pass that will last your whole trip.

It's like someone lit a bulb in the heads of hundreds of human leeches in order that they can annoy the living daylights out of vulnerable tourists.I have known Durbar square to be a pretty ornate place to visit, un-hassled, relaxed and something to see without being annoyed by persistent leeches who don't understand the meaning of NO.Pay attention to fake guides, even though they will produce a Guides ID...it's likely to be fake. Arrange tours ahead of your visit, online and get a knowledgeable committed guide not a money grabber who has no clue as to what they are doing.Sadu's or holy men will resent you taking a photo and the hand will be out quickly for money if you do, and that's provided you can, as they have copped-on to the fact that tourists are in general stupid, and gullible and have turned their \"holiness\" into a trade, they cover their faces with cardboard if the see a camera and force you to approach them for a photo at a price, and maybe they are not all genuine Sadu's, but they do make for a good photo. Don't rush into photographing the first one you see and negotiate, you will see more Sadu's at other sites across Kathmandu that are more willing to be photographed at little or no cost.Visit the place of the living Goddess, just off the square, a reputable guide will arrange a visit there (there is a fee to enter), no photos permitted of the Goddess if she appears from her balcony, you will be watched. Visit the street occupied by European hippies in the sixties which is just beside the Square and the Palace of the living Goddess also for a trip, (not that type of trip), down memory lane and see where all the hippy shops are. Watch out for groups of young teenagers who are pickpocket gangs, these operate throughout Kathmandu and especially at tourist sites and Thamel, they often masquerade as \"guides\" complete with fake ID and you will be a wallet lighter if you engage with them...you've been warned. The Square and the adjacent surrounding are definitely worth a visit, but get a reputable guide."

Here you can see many artifacts from King Tribhuwan's reign, including many quite bizarre items such as his favourite bird, now suitably stuffed in its original cage. Well managed and plenty of staff to ask questions if you wish. The wired roof in the main courtyard used to prevent the copious pidgeon population is interesting, but with limited success to be honest.

For future travellers I will give two suggestions:- (1) Reach the point before 3 p.m., otherwise the Museum will be closed, & (2) There is one more Durbar Square in the South of Kathmandu at Patan, which is also a good one, but you don't need to go there if your sight seeing includes Kathmandu Durbar......Because Patan Durbar is small in size, and excluding this point you can save your time and money.

The latter is no doubt much bigger and contains 2 biggest attractions - Kumari house and the Taleju temple but it's far more noisier and crowded than Patan. This is because vehicles move about freely within the square which makes it difficult to move around. The Kumari house is a good visit but it was really painful to see a pretty little girl locked up. The Taleju temple can be seen from outside as it is never open for worship. It open only for a special prayer offering once a year. The Kalbhairav statue is another attraction that one must see. Overall strictly in my personal opinion, if you have seen the Patan Square you can give this one a miss."

There are around 50 temples in the vicinity including the temple Taleju Bhawani which was brought from Indian continent by Mallas with them in around 9th Century. The Durbar is divided into two courtyards, the outer comprising Kasthamandap, Kumari Ghar, and Shiva-Parvati Temple, and the inner consisting of Hanuman Dhoka and the main palace. Important ceremonies, including the coronation of the Nepali monarch, are held in the Kathmandu Durbar Square. If you are in Kathmandu please do not missed to visit this place."

Given the number of visitors (all of whom pay an entrance fee) surely funds are not an issue. The old palace is well preserved, but several of the large display windows are cracked, so it is impossible to get nice photos of the Royal palanquins, etc. I was intrigued by a sign for the bombed landrover of one of the Kings - the vehicle itself is just parked at the back with no information at all.

The tour lasted app. 45 minutes, and it made a huge difference. Our Lonely Planet Nepal tour guide has useful info, but no pictures in it- so you are never really sure if you are reading about a correct place. The only annoying thing about the square are all the persistent vendors of knives, necklaces, flutes, but I guess it is a good test to learn to say no."

Kathmandu Durbar square(basantpur), Patan Durbar Square(lalitpur) Bhaktapur Durbar Square( Bhaktapur). The best among these is the Bhaktapur Durbar Square. Surprisingly, the Bhaktapur Durbarsquare is maintained well and is clean. Its a surprise since finding cleanliness in temples and tourist spots in Kathmandu is a rarity. People are habbitual in spitting around the place while walking and in markets. You will find Garbage and mud all around the place. you wont be able to walk a long distance on the road since the place is highly dusty and without a mask you just cannot walk around. Coming back to Kathmandu Durbar Square, it is located in a very busy market. so you will find all vegetable and flower vendors just crowding the place. the most irritating part for all the Durbar Squares is all unemployed youths climbing on the steps and sitting on those steps for hours together. How does a tourist enjoy the peace and tranquility of the place and how does a tourist click nice pictures. These people are sitting on those steps throughout the day and watching all the tourists. Somehow authorities are also just watching them and not asking them to not crowd the place. Is this is picture that a tourist should carry with them. Also within this area where this monument is located, while walking on the streets, look before you step since it is really very filthy."

The square is a general walk-through/hang out area for locals, who lounge about on all the temples, eating and smoking, but if you're a foreigner they charge you 750 rupees to get in. We paid it because this is supposed to be a must-see in Kathmandu but minutes later realised we'd been totally scammed. The temples are dirty and, as i said, crawling with people, so you can't really see them, and the locals all just walk through like it's a shopping center. A total rip off! When we returned to the ticket booth to enquire what we'd actually paid for, the price of the ticket includes entry to the 'museum', which is a crusty building with a few rooms containing some old photos and a small collection of dusty, faded artifacts, which weren't interesting and we didn't want to go to. Later, while we were walking about Kathmandu we inadvertently walked back into the square, where there was no one charging or any mention of tickets, so you don't actually have to pay, only if you go in at the wrong entrance. Don't waste your money. It's left a very bad taste for me. Oh, and i won't even mention the sheer number of touts, everywhere, who are also loitering to fleece the western tourist! Scam, scam, scam!"

Worth a look if you are in the area, and probably worth the entry fee but only if you do not go to the more impressive Bhaktapur Durbar."

Having made my way to this city at the top of the world, A city that sits on a plateau surrounded by high mountains. the valley is the only flat and level terrain in the Himalayan mountains, Allegedly the result of a huge Meteor strike back in the dawn of history.The thing that struck me, and endeared me to the Nepalese people was when i entered a Temple, unusual in as much as it was dedicated to the Hindu Elephant God Ganesha, with this country being Buddhist in its outlook.Upon entering i was surprised to see a seated Buddha in crossed legged Lotus position. Another jolt to my senses was opposite hanging on the wall a Cross with the figure of Jesus upon it..Of course there was a statue of our friend the Elephant God, Albeit only just taking pride of place over the Goddess Kali. Now to me a cynic, when it comes to the divisive nature of religion, seemed a very grown up and sensible arrangement, when upon asking it was explained simply and in a matter of fact tone.that although, the Temple was for Ganesha,. Followers of other faiths, no matter who or what were welcome to worship inside. A good and healthy arrangement to my way of thinking. The other thing that i took too was the government licensed shop that sold nothing but the best Hashish to be found anywhere.Subsequently closed down after demands from the Americans, who in my opinion interfere far too much in matters around the world. Again your date box wont allow me to select so i'll click on one, But ignore it as the year was 1972"

The architecture has a strong bias towards Western and Eastern styles. The feature of the place is the presence of 50 temples within the area and comprises the temple Taleju Bhawani. The Shiv-Parvati Temple is also found here as also the Hanuman Dhoka. Parts of the area are converted into museums. Together with the museums one can glean the history of Nepal. Comingling with the ancient history of Nepal is the freak street which is nearby. This street has the dubious record of having been the epicenter of the hippie culture of the 1960s. Though not much activity is found in this street, it is worth seeing just to remind you not to get carried away by drugs."

We saw her at 4 pm and it is said that if she makes eye contact with you you will,have good fortune. Be warned however, the area is full of 'guides' looking to give you a tour. Most will approach you with an offer and will leave you alone after you politely tell them no. However some are very aggressive. We got harassed by one fellow who kept following us around and would not take no for an answer even when we told him him to leave us alone (after trying to politely say no many times). This made the visit less enjoyable. Nevertheless, if you are prepared for this, it really is a must see. It is quite something, and there are cafes around the square where you can take some great rooftop photos of the grounds."

Our guide actually took us to the square so we didn\u2019t have the same problem that others have had with would-be guides hassling us to hire them. Lonely Planet has a couple of very good self-guided walking tours if you don\u2019t want to hire a guide. Tickets for the Square cost around $10 but we were able to extend our 1-day ticket for free for the whole of our stay in Kathmandu by going to the site office in Basantapur Square (alongside the Durbar Square). I love all the beautiful old temples, palaces and monuments in the Square, it\u2019s great to climb the steps on some of the buildings or sit in a rooftop caf\u00e9 and watch the world go by. The history and the architecture on display in this area is amazing. Unfortunately, since my last visit to Nepal, the amount of traffic has increased markedly and the incessant vehicle noise and tooting of horns has spoilt the atmosphere of this lovely old part of the city. It would be great if traffic was banned from this area to allow tourists and locals alike to go about their business without being nearly run over every few seconds. However, this is still the number one attraction for me in Kathmandu \u2013 I consider it a \u201cmust see\u201d if you\u2019re visiting Nepal."

Just south of the Thamel district in Katmandu is the area of ancient palaces and temples known as Durbar Square. It will cost you about $10 for a ticket but your ticket can be made good for your entire stay in Nepal (ask the ticket seller where to go to get that taken care of). You can also wander around the smaller alleys just adjacent to Durbar Square and find yourself in the heart of the temple area having bypassed the ticket seller.You will be besieged by guides offering their services, by rickshaws and taxi drivers offering to take you to the monkey temple, by flute and fruit and tiger balm sellers, but this will be no different from your experience in any of the tourist areas of Katmandu. Walk up the steps of any of the temples and you will generally be left alone to sit or take photos or read a novel or chat with locals or with other tourists.There are parts of the enclosure which are really public streets and should be completely accessible. Many of the shops marketing merchandise to tourists can be visited only if you buy a ticket or get in otherwise. This was my fourth trip to Katmandu and the first time I had to pay. I wonder how much of the money they get goes to maintaining the buildings and how much goes toward the general Katmandu budget.While Durbar Square is an important site in Katmandu it's best to follow the guide book tours and visit the many temples and courts and shops north and south of the Square as well. It's even better to just walk and get lost, then locate yourself and get lost again. Be especially vigilant, though: the tourist areas of Katmandu are noisy and crowded and polluted and overrun with vehicles dashing madly along. Even a short walk can be exhausting."

The only difference is that tourists are now charged a fee to enter (however, we didn't pay the fees as we came in from Freak Street and nobody was guarding that entrance). We found the practice of paying a fee ridiculously inconsistent as locals are allowed to set up a market once the sun sets; then anyone can walk in and out, sit on the stairs, spit everywhere, etc. Nobody guards the Square once the sun sets, in contradiction to the govt's desire to protect its heritage. However, the night market is really interesting, full of local flavour and life. It's the best time to visit Durbar Square as it's most authentic then."

Good museumWe also visited the Kumari temple \u2013 home of the living goddess , a virgin girl chosen through an ancient and mystical selection process to become the human incarnation of the Hindu mother goddess, Durga. We were not able to see her though, because she makes an appearance after 4PM. We arrived 12NN. It was okay, we went to the balcony cafes instead and enjoyed the view. There is also the Macchendra nath temple dedicated to the god of rain and Bhairaw temple. We were able to find good souvenirs in the Durbar Square at reasonable prices.

It's worth paying for the extra days if you love the culture - after you get the 1 day entrance pass, you can go to the Kathmandu Metropolitan City (KMC) office (it'll be on the map you get once you pay the entrance fee) next to the Kumari temple and get the 3 day visitor pass (take a passport photo along with you). We spent a few days wandering through the Ganesh temple, the old palace museum (fascinating) and bumped into a local guide who we negotiated for 100,000 for 2-3 hours PM me if you want his details. Too many temples/ experiences to talk about here, but the carvings on the old palace museum were already enough to get us going back for the 3 days. The price of entry to support the maintenance of this Unesco listed site is cheap, in my opinion. (Please don't be like the arrogant tourists we saw who refused to pay the entry fee as \"they were only shopping, not going into sites/ temples\"). A small price to pay to absorb such history/ culture. :)"

The \"living goddess Kumari\" occasionally appears at her window but not for long & no photos are allowed. Just to see the craftsmanship of the Newari people makes the trip a must."

I know many would suggest to go with a couple males but if you're all women you WILL be ok, I would just recommend a group of 4-5+. It's not exactly cheap to get in, I think 750 rupees? So be prepared for that. Once you buy admission there will be lots of \"tour guides\" who will try to show you around, some licensed, some not. Licensed tour guides usually charge 350 rupee per person, but if you go with an unlicensed guy, you can bargain down to about 100 rupee per person. We got a guy who was unlicensed (he hangs around the entrance, wearing a white t-shirt with the little princess, or Kumari, on). If you see him, please use him! He's very knowledgeable and gives a really good deal-- the tour was 45 minutes long and we saw a lot. He's great but of course we never got his name. Make sure to see the Kumari!! She's really cool, and appears by request (your tour guide can do this for you, licensed or unlicensed... but you SHOULD have a tour guide to do it). Worth checking out. Have fun! Durbar Square is really once-in-a-lifetime!!"

The Kumari who wrote the book just seemed so amazing. It's available in the bookstores in KTM. And if you don't believe there is an actual goddess just ask anyone who has had a Kumari miracle-like me!

The red brick buildings will make you feel as if you are taking a stroll in an ancient city. This place also house the palace in which the girl who is referred to as 'Kumari' lives in. She is believed by the citizens to be a reincarnation of the blood thirsty goddess - Kali. I have been told that this place is used to kill a lot of animals during the time of a particular festival. However, at the time that we visited this place, it was clean and beautiful and inviting. There is a fee for this place as well. However, the charges are lesser if you are from a SAARC country. This place is also splattered with small shrines and temples. The square has been subject to a lot of destruction during the time of the earth quake some years ago. There are good restaurants and a museum inside the square. My husband and I were fortunate enough to visit a place in which the singing bowl is made. The shopkeeper was such a nice person and he sat with us explaining the whole process and demonstrating various uses of the singing bowl. This place is at the back of the 'Fair Trade Centre'. The singing bowl is used for meditation and healing purposes and it is allegedly good for the blood circulation. It is made of a mix of seven metals. The most pricey singing bowl is called the moon bowl and it is apparently made on the day of the full moon. In the square you will also find a lot of boutiques which sell Pashmina and Cashmere and Silk shawls. There are so many restaurants around this place and you might even be able to spend the whole day here! Do not miss this beautiful place!"

Though a few of the square\u2019s 50-plus monuments date from the 12th century, most are from the time of the Malla Kings. Probably the most famous building here is the Kumari Bahal, a building richly decorated with beautiful woodcarvings, which is home to the Royal Kumari, the Living Goddess, a manifestation of the great goddess Durga. Nearby the former Royal Palace is a Malla Dynasty dwelling, once considerably more extensive than today. Within, the courtyard Nassal Chowk, originally hosted dramatic dance performances, now it is the coronation site of the Shah kings and contains some of the finest wood carvings you will see anywhere in the country."

The area called the Kathmandu Darbar Square is made up of beautiful temples, a couple of large squares and a palace, surrounded by narrow lanes laced with old buildings where people still live and work. Even though touristy, one can get a flavor of everyday life, where locals use it as a thoroughfare and as a place to hang out. Often jammed with motorbikes and pedestrians, young love birds sitting in a corner or up in the open balcony of some temple, the place pulsates with life. The visit to Kumari Chowk is a must, as it showcases beautifully carved Nepali wood work that dates back several centuries. If you are lucky, like we were, you may behold the Kumari, the child living goddess, who sometimes peeks out from the tiny balcony above the smallish courtyard. Photographing the Kumari is forbidden though. Unless you want to see how a Nepali palace interior looks with its dark narrow corridors and rooms with poor display of photos of the former royal family, do not bother to pay an extra amount to visit the Hanuman Dhoka palace. Instead, just sit back and soak in the atmosphere of the colorful old town Kathmandu."

The Kumari is a pre-pubescent girl who is believed to be the incarnation of a HIndu goddess until she menstruates. We were not allowed to take her pictures. Anyone who does will have his camera confiscated. We took pictures only of her postcards. To the Nepalis, the Kumari is a living goddess. We were there in time for her daily appearance.

This is definitely the most important place to visit in Kathmandu itself and every visitor should spend some time in and around the square. There are a large number of shrines and temples to visit, over 50 I think though some are very small, and many with quite splendid architecture \u2013 although it is crumbling a bit in parts. However, be aware that entering the old Royal Palace itself at the centre of the square does have drawbacks. The main problem is that it is quite a large Palace and took us around 2 hours to visit. There is a lot of walking involved, much of it up and down stairs, some very narrow, all over the Palace and this can get extremely tiring \u2013 and there are not many places to rest. I suppose we could have climbed over some of the barriers and taken some short cuts but we didn't have a map of the building with us so are quite likely to have got totally lost. In addition, my wife, who is a better walker than I am, sprained her knee trying to climb up the steep stairs to the top of one of the tallest buildings in the complex \u2013 I wisely remained further down. We did take the time to try and look at a number of the exhibits so could have speeded up things by looking at less \u2013 which is what we did after the first half hour or so. The trouble is that there are lots, and lots, and lots, of memorabilia relating to the lives of the ex Nepalese Royal Family \u2013 in fact that is nearly all there is inside the Palace. For a Nepali this would of course be of great interest but for a tourist it does become quite repetitive and not that interesting. In addition, most of the rooms are poorly lit, as well as being quite dusty. However the architecture of the inner courtyards are worth seeing and quite special. Although photography in the main Durbar Square is fine, it is not allowed inside the Royal Palace and there are lockable lockers by the entrance where you are asked to leave cameras and bags etc. You are encouraged by the staff to leave a small tip.Entrance to the Durbar Square is 750 Nepali Rupees though you need to pay at one of a number of booths dotted around the various entrances to the square \u2013 I think I counted 4 separate booths. However, we were never asked for our ticket except when we went into the Royal Palace. The temple of the Living Goddess is also in the Square but entry to that is not included in the price and you need to pay extra. You are likely to be approached by various people trying to get you to hire them to be a guide. They were a bit persistent but OK about it when we politely declined. There is also a handicrafts market in an open area in one part of the square \u2013 some nice stuff there but we thought the prices were on the high side."

For me, this mix of history, religious artifacts and everyday life is typical of Nepal's capital. The Kumari House and the museum are worth a visit."

The museum isn't really worth the visit, but you may get a peek and see Kumori, the living goddess in another temple. The Newari woodcarvings are quite amazing."

Go at around 4-5pm for some quick local crafts shopping, then spend the rest of the evening at any of the many rooftop restaurants over a beer. Watch as the sun disappears, and the square below bustles with life in the dark. It really is surreal.Make sure to ask for an extension on the slightly pricey NPR750 entrance fee. They can extend your ticket for an additional 2 days for free. Just ask at the ticket counter and they'll tell you where to go."

All these squares are Unesco World Heritage sites.We visited all of these in 1 day excursion. Kathmandu Durbar square also known as Hanuman Dhoka as is having a nice statue of Hanumanji.Its a huge complex with lot of temples & large clean pavement.Patan is famous for Krishna temple, Golden temple & numerous statues of Shri Ram,Hanuman& other Hindu Gods & Goddesses.Bhaktapur is little far off from Kathmandu (30-35 kms) having a tall 5 storeyed temple along with old palaces & monateries.Lots of pigeons were seen in Hanuman Dhoka & in Patan Durbar square.Though all three squares are more or less same having Pagoda style temples,and excellent wooden & metal carvings but each has something extra to offer to the visitors. I personally feel one must visit all three during a visit to Kathmandu."

My friend Kimberly and I were there the day The Living Goddess (The Kumari) was allowed to leave her home be seen by the commoners! The crowd was enormous. I felt completely immersed in the inner city and the heart of Kathmandu. What luck! The Nepali people were friendly but needy and a bit untrustworthy. There were moments of 10 people surrounding us if we pulled out a dollar. Our guide was great for 2 days until he asked for $700 cash for his sick mother by the end. It broke my heart. He was a wonderful kid but really just needed money like the rest of the Nepali people. There was a tiny handful of tourists from Australia and Europe to balance out the tour but I was the only blonde person I saw for 2 days. I was stunned by the poverty and desperation of the people of Kathmandu. I was energized by the sites in Dubar Square with the shrines and temples and the blessings and completely blown away by the energy of these crowds. This is not a place to bring your kids but one of those places that is so layered with rich culture mixed with joyful color and hindu/buddhist/Nepali tradition as well as so much sorrow for the poor that this place will always be in my heart. It will stick with you forever."

Covering quite a few acres in the city centre, it contains a marvellous collection of temples, many with exquisite wood carving. Most memorable for me was the Kumari-ghar, a handsome 3-storey building where the 'living goddess' resides. Taken from her family at the age of 3, she remains the living goddess until the moment of puberty. Only the most recent incumbent has insisted that she be educated, so that she can have some career in later life. I was puzzled initially by a sign that said 'Forbidden to photograph the Kumari'. But this is the name for the living goddess herself, who resides on the top floor and is occasionally glimpsed by visitors. An aged male guardian was clearly visible, gazing down on the many tourist visitors.  Non-Hindus are not allowed to enter any of the Hindu temples in the square, but there is a wealth of beautifully decorated buildings of various sorts to enjoy. While we were there, we witnessed a noisy musical procession in the main part of the square. We returned to our tour coach with an enjoyable down-hill race through the streets on cycle-rickshaw."

Agree, this is an exaggeration, maybe it is downright unfair to this famous square but still I would say the way to it is not enough appreciated.From Thamel center it is a nice, 2-3 km, walk to Durbar square. Along the way you will be engulfed by everyday Kathmandu life, not the Thamel kind, but the normal life for the Nepali living near the center. You will pass through their shopping area containing micro shops selling just about anything for everyday life. Spices, meat, groceries, drinks, fish, vegetables, kitchen utensil, garllands to be used for religious ceremonies, clothing, etc etc... As said, anything you can think of.If that all gets too hectic, step through one of the small ports that may bring you into the inner space of a court where the people live, do their laundry and children play their games, seemingly miles away from the hussle and bustle of the street.There is one drawback to going into Durbar Square that way. When you finally reach the square you may reach the Square more ready for a moment of mental rest then for the call from the entry booth to pay your 750 pp fee for entering Durbar Square. The continuous flow of people and traffic that passes through the square also makes it unclear why YOU suddenly should pay to be allowed to go further. The added emphasis of the policeman that escorts you to the booth however makes it clear that there is no escaping, even if you do not mind to just walk through the square and not go into any of the buildings that are open to visitors.Durbar Square Kathmandu has a lot of historic buildings in a relatively small space. Apparently there are more then 50 temples/shrines on the square, among them the most intriguing (to me) residence of the living goddess, the Kumari. The leaflet you get after paying the entry fee lists the most notable ones with some explanation. Of the buildings we were allowed to enter we visited the Royal Palace. This is a complex consisting of a number of connected courts. It is a pity that most of the interior is not open to visitors.As said Durbar Square Kathmandu is certainly worth the visit, but I certainly would not want to miss the walk to it."

I arrived to Durbar Square by foot when the sun was almost setting already and the approaching twilight added to the feel of magic in the air. If you start your walk from Thamel along the cobblestone street you will experience buildings getting older and the feeling holy in a secular way as different types of temples line the way. The old buildings of the square are wonderful to photograph and one can sit and mingle with the crowd, photographing and watching the birds. There are interesting Buddhist art shops nearby, some with authentic artwork. Just be careful on your way back to the hotel - if that's where you are staying and especially if it is a smaller one - some of the taxis may not know yours, nor English, and it is good to have a precise address and if possible a cell phone handy. Strongly recommend a visit here!"

They will do this every time you walk across the square. But if you pay once you can get a ticket for the same price. Simply take your original ticket and receipt (if you get one) with a passport photo and take them to the small office located just behind the open air stall holders - the guards will point you if you ask. This will entitle you to weeks of entering the square, so you can just flash your card and wander through. This is great for those staying in freakstreet or simply exploring the city for a week as you'll cross the sqare alot and it beats arguing/avoiding the guards. Also the money is being spent on the actual square and those looking after it. You can do the same for Bhaktapur too (not sure about Patan)."

I really enjoyed Durbar Square the first time I visited with a guide, lots of fascinating Buddhist and Hindu Shrines to see including the Kumari - a living Goddess - a tradition unique to to Nepal as far as I am aware. I would recommend going with a guide as written information about what you're seeing is thin on the ground. However, on the second visit (back from our trek and returning to Kathmandu before our flight home) we went without a guide and a local official tried to charge us 750rupees just for crossing the square as they assume the only reason you are there is to go round the temples rather than to simply walk round the square and look. (this charge only applies to foreigners). I think they need to make better arrangements for visitors to pay for individual attractions as many people such as myself like to be able to walk around a place and experience the atmosphere more than once rather than being charged a fee for simply crossing the square which is admittedly less than $10US, but still, if you're getting near the end of your holiday and running low on local currency it's a bit of an annoyance."

Warning: Once you buy one souvenir, you will be surrounded by others trying to sell you stuff!!I didn't quite appreciate the 'magic' or popularity of this place, as told in the travel guides.

Hanuman-dhoka Durbar Square - World Heritage Site Monument Zone - this is \"short\" and official name of this all amazing complex of temples, shrines, palaces and other interesting buildings. This is 'must see' point of your tour when in Nepal. It is crowded, crazy, commercial and lost 'original spirit' long time ago. Plus, the most annoying and actually sad is, that there are too many pigeons (people feed them there) and they totally ruin this incredible place. All wooden parts of shrines or houses are rusted because of the birds' guano... Honestly, that's really sad to see that these sculptures survived few hundreds years and now they are all in great danger because of people feeding these flying vermin and allowing cars (and motorbikes) to enter this area. Be ready for sticky polluted air around you.Another think which I really didn't like and it was making me leave this place ASAP were 'local guides'. I know and understand that for some of them this is only one way to earn some money, but they should take it as well when somebody says 'no!' and leave, not insist. Anyway, as I mentioned earlier, this is great historical complex with few most important places in Kathmandu. Do not forget to visit living goddess Kumari shrine, Hanuman Statue and Museum in old palace. Entry fee for foreigner is 750 NPR (approx. 7 EUR). Ticket is valid all day, but if you wish to come back you could do so for free, but... You have to go with your ticket and photo ID to Site Office and ask for Visitor Pass. They do that for free. TAKE 1 PHOTO with you because then they can extend your ticket up to 7 days, other less they can do that only for 3 days. Ladies there were kind enough and gave me as well some CDs about Kumari. That was nice. Photos are allowed in most of the places (not inside of some shrines) and in museum they will tell you that you need to leave your camera in the locker - do not do that as you can take some nice pictures inside and from the palace tower. I've seen so many people doing it and I was only one stupid leaving my camera inside with the bag. Museum ticket is included in the price."

Durbar Square is in fact a series of square's and is the heart of the old town which is where the royal family used to reside in a palace called Hanuman Dhoka.The buildings are an eclectic mix of shapes and sizes which makes Durbar Square so special. Most of the buildings date back to the 17th century, many were badly damaged in the 1934 earthquake but you would not be able to tell by looking at them.I would strongly suggest you visit Hanuman Dhoka you have to pay extra but it is well worth the cost. Durbar Square can get very busy and Hanuman Dhoka is an oasis of calm and far from the maddening crowd as well as being a very good museum.The downsides is that the area is very dirty with waste lying all over the place and you can get hassled by so called \"official\" guides wishing to take you on a tour. Don't let these minor distractions put you off. If you enjoy this experience there are two more Durbar Square's in Patan and Bhaktapur. The square in Bhaktapur is a 45 minute taxi ride and in our opinion is the best of the three."

It earliest traces back to the first king of Kathmandu City in 11th century, Durbar Square used to be a courtyard of a royal palace wherein numerous religious constructions devoted to Hindus God sand Goddesses were phased in during subsequent hundred years. Ever since, the gilded time of wooded houses has never stopped shining and attracting worldwide tourists\u2019 curiosity.Spend a full day in the square and its vicinity to taste the real Nepalese life pulse. At first light, the square plays a fresh food market before being packed with traffic and local youth. At noon, Durbar Square definitely belongs to cameras of foreign visitors while the streets nearby becomes a shopping paradise of inexpensive souvenirs. By night, Durbar Square either is a hub of festival activities or stays hushed and silently slumbers away."

The Kumari (living goddess) may appear at her palace window around 11.00 or sometimes around 16.00 in the afternoon, who visiting the temple please manage your time to see Kumari but Not allowed to take pitures. anyway i strongly recommend this place to whom going to visit kathmandu."

On one side of the square is the old palace buildings and on the other side are scattered temples, which are all built in Newari style architecture ( Built by Newar kings some hundreds of years ago, and absolutely unique to Nepal). With so many festivals happening in Ktm, there is every possibility that you might witness one being carried out in one of these squares. While there, do check the details of the palace buildings and temples. The wood & stone carvings on these temples often have many stories to tell. These durbar squares also house museums which are worth checking. The one in Hanumandhoka is the biggest, but I particularly like the one in Patan. The museum building was renovated, but still retains the style of old architecture and has so many antique collections which all reflect newari style tradition. Though all Durbar squares follow the similar composition, if you want to travel back in time, and not get hassled by the bustling crowd and busy vendors, then I particularly recommend the one in Bhaktapur. Not just the durbar square, the whole city of Bhaktapur takes you back in time. Do walk through the narrow alleys, the pavements of which are still intact with local bricks, check in the local potteries, handicrafts, statues, stone artefacts etc being made around (some crafters are so engrossed in their work that they won\u2019t even notice you are there! ) So yeah, do sit back and relax in one of the many cafes, situated on the top floor of any of the renovated temples and enjoy the day to day life of the locals. I\u2019m pretty thrilled to see items like wheat, chillies, etc, just being laid on the road for them to dry! People taking baths & washing clothes in public stone bath areas! People transporting water in specially made vases for their everyday use! Must visit! Just a few kilometres away from Ktm, yet it feels like you are well and truly centuries back in time!"

People we met in the hotel where we were staying suggested Durbar Square. When we arrived, we immediately took pictures of the amazing temples and the scenery (busy streets packed with tourists). After a few steps, a guy (without any ID) approached us and asked us to come with him to the Security Post. We were frightened because we thought we violated some rules (I was wearing a sleeveless shirt so I put on my jacket). The guy at the post informed us that we need to pay the tourist fee of 300 rupees / head just for touring the place (relieved). We told him we need to exchange money first and we were escorted by the same guy who first approached us to the nearest money exchange booth. While walking, the guy told us that we don't need to pay to see the sites for as long as we walk with him. We just need to pay him some money for the tour. We agreed. During the walk, he introduced us to another guy (who speaks very good english and japanese) who was a licensed tour guide in Nepal (he showed as an ID). He brought us to all the amazing temples (the erotic temple was my favourite... LOL... and the Palace of the Living Goddess) and explained the history of everything we visited. We ended the tour with a small snack in a roof-top restaurant over-looking the square. I handed him 500 rupees then said that they normally charge 1000. We obliged since me and my friend were satisfied with their service. We find it better than paying 600 rupees for nothing."

Kumari Bahal, house of a young girl who is selected to be the town's living goddess, consists of beautiful wood carving of different god and goddesses. Kasthamandap, built in the early sixteenth century by King Laxmi Narsingha Malla using wood of a single tree, is believed to have inspired the name of Kathmandu City. Maru Ganesh is small but one of the most visited temple in Kathmandu. Every Tuesday thousands of people gather to worship Lord Ganesh.Only thing that most people complain about is the traffic.

Even Kumari\u00b4s house, while interesting from the outside, just leads to a grim courtyard covered with bird [--]all around. When she appears at her window you\u00b4re not allowed to take a picture. It\u00b4s a lengthy walk from Thamel so if you give it a complete miss, nothing is lost as long as you see Patan and Bhaktapur."

            "review": "Minus the traffic, it's perfect!. Whilst all three parts of the square can be covered in an hour or two, I'd recommend spending at least half the day there. When walking around, have a close look at the carvings on the buildings for many of them depict stories of Nepal's history and/or writings and scriptures.A camera with a good zoom is handy to take in these details. Best not to take photos of anyone dressed like a sage and also, try to visit the Kumari's palace at a time when she appears as it's apparently an honoured experience.Watch out for the traffic weaving through the square, especially the motorbikes."

            "review": "The middle of Kathmandu's history. I took a tour of Kathmandu Durbur Square with a guide from my hotel. We drove there in a taxi from Thamel. I was able to get a fairly complete history of the area. It was a fascinating experience. The fact the square was once the palace for the king and the way the square was added on to over the years was interesting. I was able to get great pictures of the historical buildings and the people. There are shops are similar to other places in the City where you can buy local items. The cost to visit the square as a foreigner is 350 Rupees \u2013 about $4.50 US$The area is definitely not a comfortable tourist destination. It can be a harsh overload to the senses if you are not ready for it. There are not clean cozy cafes and clean and plentiful restrooms. It is a crazy mish-mash of people sitting on the street selling produce, spices etc., people worshiping at their favorite temple and a crush of vehicles ranging from cars & motorcycles to rickshaws all in a hurry honking their horns. The traffic is complete chaos. The key is to know this and plan for this."

We walked there from thamel, the mian tourist district (although it is a good 20 min walk thoguh town so get a taxi if that doesn't appeal to you). I was promised gradeur pagodas and amazing sites, it's actually just an area with about 20-30 pagodas which are all in a state of dis-repair, there's only one or two you can go inside, but they were all closed for refurbishment. We ended spending all day in the roof top restaurants surrounding Durbar (these I would highly recommend for the views)."
