I wouldn't recommend taking small or over exuberant children on a wet day as the paths are very narrow in places. Remember to dip your hand in the spring that feeds the salt pans. It is so warm that you could take a bath in it. Almost as salty as the Dead Sea! It gets very busy and sometimes tricky to pass people coming in the opposite direction.Not suitable for those with restricted mobility."

I enjoyed the whole part, not only the lovely drive but the salt flats alone and how they began and to exist today, is amazing.The families continue to work and service these salt flats everyday. They are very valuable and the families just do not give them up. It settles in a very lovely valley off the Sacred Valley and should not be missed. Yes you need a guide, just to learn all there is here, and you can hire one at the entrance again. What we like doing is just hiring a driver for the day, that will cost you about $75.-85. Then also hire an English speaking guide or whatever language you want, that will be about $100. with the tip.But gosh do you get to see and know everything. Stop for a lite lunch where they know it's safe to eat, and take you to the markets for a little shopping of Alpaca of course, and then back to the Hotel. We were gone about 6-7 hours and it came in under $200. per day. We did this in the Sacred Valley for 2 days and saw most of it. Then just hiked or took taxisfor anything in between. I recommend 4 days in the Valley to see and experience it all. I would stay in Ollyantaytamo, we just enjoyed that village sooooo much."

Maras (located in the Sacred Valley) is a place that produce salt since the pre Inca times, and it is amazing to see the stream taking salty water to the 3000 ponds, each pond is about 5 square meters and not deeper than 30 cms. They produce tons of salt every year and the best is that it is managed by local people. Salt from Maras is well known everywhere in Peru and travellers are looking for it even at the supermarkets in Lima. When you go to Maras, do yourself a favor and buy some salt with medicinal plants, take a bath using it, your body will thank you! And of course, you can get some pink salt for your consumption!My last tip: go during the dry season (May to October) so that you can see it better."

We were traveling in a group of six and were able to hire two private taxis from Cusco for 120 soles per car to take us to Salinas de Maras, wait an hour for us to explore and then drive us back to Cusco. The drive out to the salt pans was very beautiful with dramatic mountain landscapes. Once we arrived we paid our 10 sole entrance fee and continued on to walk through the salt fields, taking pictures as you went. There was a group of school children there so it was quite busy but the views were still impressive and the salt that we bought from the nearby shops is really good and really cheap. We're on a long backpacking trip so the different salts have come in handy for adding some flavor to our daily cheap meals :) Worth a trip from Cusco if you have a free day and fancy a little road trip. If traveling solo and can't afford the private taxi there is a local collectivo that goes to a town close to maras at which point you'd have to taxi a taxi the rest of the way."

As you approach and look across the mountain backdrop, the terraces stand out as a dramatic white landscape. When I went it was bright sunshine which made for incredible photos as the white salt terraces glistened in the sun.The source of the salt naturally comes from an upstream mountain hot spring, where the salty mineral rich water is channelled into hundreds of small pans where it is evaporated and then harvested. The entrance is not included on the \"Boleto Turistico\" ticket but it only costs 10 Soles and is well worth it. Try the afternoon for less crowds and if possible walk down the terraces in between the individual pans to get close up. Probably allocate 45 mins and try and combine your visit with the nearby Moray agricultural terraces which are great too."

It's worth having a guide to explain the importance of the salt ponds, throughout history when the Incas used them, to nowadays when they're split (mostly evenly) amongst families in the area. There's a little shop/shack there too, selling chocolate with pink salt from the ponds, among many other things. It'll cost you 10 soles per person to get in the gate.We organised a taxi with Cusco Transport (pricey, but effective) who also stopped off in Urubamba on the way back to Cusco, and took us to Maras. There are cheaper ways to get there and back (rather than the $90 we paid between the two of us), but this was definitely much easier."

There are many stalls on the way between the car park and the salt ponds where you can buy salt and other souvenirs really cheap! I bought a pestle & mortar, hand made from granite for S/.20 \u2013 AUD8! Small bags of salt go for S/.0.50 each! Definitely allow yourself some time to shop here on your way back up to the parking area. They sell ice cold bottled water here for S/.2 The visit, including the hike up and down, takes about 45 minutes. If you want to shop at the stalls, allow at least 1 hour. If you\u2019re only going to hike down to the edge of the ponds, spend 3 minutes taking photos and hike back up \u2013 as we\u2019ve seen many people do - you\u2019ll probably be able to do it in 15-20 minutes. I saw some toilets on the way back to the car park, but did not use them so can\u2019t comment on the facilities Entry is S/.8 per person (if I remember correctly) and it is not included in the Boleto Turistico.Take a hat & wear sunscreen as once you\u2019re through the stalls, you\u2019re in the sun all the time.

Wear sunscreen! - I got a wicked burn from just roaming around the pools for 20 mins. They let you walk around and on top of the pools and you can hike right to the far end of the mountain. Well worth including in a day trip!!! Bring cash for the entrance feel - I think it was 10 soles per person, but it's a little cash only hut in the middle of nowhere."

Well, you CAN get lost, but don't worry. there are a few locals and farmers around who you can ask directions. The view from the top of the hill as you descend is breathtaking. Try the snacks sold outside the mines. They are tasty!The mines are quite pretty and you can walk between each section. It was unfortunate to see some people writing their names in the salt.

This is in Maras, about 45 mins to 1 hr from Cusco, about 45 mins from Ollantaytambo... a bit of a detour off the road between Ollantaytambo and Cusco. A very interesting site, from afar, it looks like snow on the terraces; turns out it is salt. It is an interesting landscape. Taking a walk onto the terraces is an interesting experience to see how the salt is \"mined\" - taste (don't drink!) the spring water - you will find that it is warm and very salty! It is interesting to look at the terraces but it becomes more relevant if one understands the process of \"mining\" the salt from the salty spring water. Generally, if I understand it correctly, the terraces are filled with the salty water, after which the input is stopped - the water is evaporated over a period of 3 to 5 days(?) leaving behind a layer of salt (maybe 10mm thick?). They then break up the salt insitu, and refill the terrace with the salty water again. Water is again evaporated, and the process is repeated a few times till the salt reaches the required thickness. Generally there will be 3 layers of salt - the bottom-most layer is not for human but for animal consumption - the middle layer is pinkish and has the highest grade, and the top layer is regular salt. Each layer is washed separately and the middle layer is iodized; then they are packed and sold accordingly. The process takes about 1 month to complete. (or something like that).Lastly, apparently this process is known to the Incans, but these terraces do not date back to the Inca days - apparently these terraces date back to the 1950's if my sources are correct."

If you go on the rainy season, the white salinas will be all brown and the workers will not be active there. It only still worthy the visit if you wanna have an idea of how does it work and taste the very salty water coming from the underground. If it's rainy season and you have short time, it can be easily skipped."

It is definitely strange to find such a concentration of salt so far away from the coast. A small stream supplies all the water/salt to the area and families maintain their own small plots. There are some souvenir shops here that have very reasonably priced items. I purchased Alpaca shoes and saw the same shoes in Cuzco for 3 times what I paid for them at the salt mines."

The flats are beautiful and a reminder of how rare salt is to find in nature. You need to pay 10 soles (May 2016) for entrance in addition to the cost of the driver and English speaking tour guide. In total this day trip was ~30 soles +5 soles for Inkal Sal! The roads are switchbacks and my travel friend became car sick on the ride back to Cusco. Our visit to Maras was paired with a trip to Moray, and we only had 30 minutes to visit the site with Viajes-Cusco-Peru travel. We left from Cusco at 8:40 and returned around 14:30. Bring sun-screen, sun hat, and motion-sickness medication with you if you feel car sickness! Overall very beautiful and worth the trip."

These are salt pans that are worked in the same way that they have been for 600 years, perhaps more. A saline spring is diverted and the water is evaporated.

There are so many ruins to see in the Sacred Valley that it is refreshing to find an inca site still in active use today and such is Salinas de Maras. There is a collective that still collects the salt from this fascinating site where water from a spring (that is 60% salt apparently) still flows across a series of over 5000 pools where evaporation lets miners collect and then sell the salt. The site is impressive as you descend from the hills - blazing white against the brown of the surrounding mountainsides.The stream is fast flowing and there is an interesting system of channels to move the water where is needed by a series of gates. It really is fascinating and you can freely walk out there on crunchy paths of salt. There is a small charge but it is worth it and you can walk a long way out. As always with Inca sites there is walking and climbing to get there but not much for this site. There are the ubiquitous market stalls to walk through but very non-aggressive stall holders which has been a common theme here in Peru.Salt is for sale of course! We were there in the afternoon and it was sunny and pretty warm and of course, no shade. You won't be here that long but apply sun screen! Well worth a visit, makes a fascinating change from Inca ruins."

These terraces have been in use since the Inca times. A salty spring emerges from the hillside, and the Incas cleverly built terraces capture the flows and harvest salt. In the rainy season, the pools fill with earth-toned water of varying hues, and in the dry season the water evaporates, leaving a plentiful salt residue to be harvested and sold.Definitely worth a visit if you want to see something a little out of the usual."

Salt is a necessity of life and while there are a number of ways to harvest it, the Salt Pools at Salinas de Maras is perhaps the most unusual. Salt can be mined, scraped off dry seabeds or as a byproduct of distillation. Since pre-Inca times, salt has been obtained in Maras by evaporating salty water from a local subterranean stream. The highly salty water emerges at a spring, a natural outlet of the underground stream. The flow is directed into an intricate system of tiny channels constructed so that the water runs gradually down onto the several hundred ancient terraced ponds. As water evaporates in the sun-warmed ponds, the water becomes supersaturated and salt precipitates as various size crystals onto the inner surfaces of a pond's earthen walls and on the pond's earthen floor. The pond's owner then closes the water supply off and allows the pond to go dry. Within a few days they carefully scrape the dry salt from the sides and bottom of the pool and puts it into a suitable container for removal and distribution. Then the process starts all over again.If you have 1/2 a day in Cusco to spare, this is a fascinating side trip."

The terraced salt evaporation ponds are fed by a subterranean stream. You can taste the water which is much saltier then sea water. The flow of the water into each of the pods is controlled, but since this was the wet season it was not the time for scraping off the salt, but some work was being down on the ponds to shore them up.

The best place to take pictures is to park on the side of the road, above the salt mine. The mine is situated in a valley, and surrounded by mountains. Everytime I have visited, I had to hold on to the side of the car because the wind is surprisingly strong. It was interesting to see how the salt is harvested. The salt water flows out of the mountain which seems unusual considering one is far from the ocean. The water is harvested through little tiers. Once the tier is full of water, it is closed off and the water is allowed to dry with the sun and then the salt is harvested. There is a quaint little shop that sells salt for cooking as well as beauty products that feature the salt. It is easy to feel that you have stepped back in time. In South America, June, July and August are cold months. The winds sweep in after 2 pm and the temperatures drop dramatically. Wear layers."

I had never seen evaporative salt ponds before, so this was a very interesting and new experience for me. Our bus had to travel down into the valley to get to the salt ponds. Before getting there, the bus stopped at a high lookout point that gave us a great overview of the entire breadth of the ponds. Some great views of the valley.From the parking lot, the walk to the ponds was deceptively difficult, and I had to stop several times to regain my wind. Interesting to put a drop of the river water on your finger and taste the saltiness.You will pass through several vendor stalls that offer various souvenirs and arts & crafts. They also sell small packets of the actual salt that is collected from the ponds, including the often-reported \"pink salt\" (contains small amount of iron oxide, giving it a pinkish hue). (I actually regret not buying some salt!) If, like me, you've never seen evaporative salt ponds before, I think you'd find this tour interesting. But if you're already familiar with salt ponds, this might be a little boring to you.We visited here as part of a combination tour that subsequently went to the archaeological site at Moray (the circular agricultural terraces). That is probably the best way to do this tour."

The steep valley slopes are rust brown covered with coarse scrub, making the bright white salt ponds all the more striking.Since pre-Inca times, salt has been obtained in Maras by evaporating salty water from a local subterranean stream, which surfaces as a trickling spring.The salt ponds are less than 3 feet square in area, & none exceeds 12 inches in depth. All are shaped into polygons.The flow of water is carefully controlled & monitored by the workers. When the pond's keeper closes the water-feeder notch, the water evaporates under the equatorial sun within a few days. After which, the salt is carefully scraped from the sides & bottom of the pond, put it into large bags & hand carried up the slopes to be brought to market. Then the water-supply notch is reopened, & the process starts anew. The pale pink salt bolsters the Peruvian economy being shipped worldwide to meet the rising demand for salt on highways as well as being used by Peruvian chefs for its unique pink color & flavor."

The water evaporates, creating a bed of salt which is gathered typically by families who own the pond.

You'll want to do this with a guid or at least learn more about it before you go, as simply visiting the mines with no understanding of it takes away and limits its wow-factor. After your visit, you can purchase salt as well. I suggest visiting the salt mines with a tour that also goes to Maras. My fianc\u00e9 and I arranged the two as private tour from the Cusco airport and got dropped off at our hotel in Urubamba after the tour. This removed the need of a hotel pick up when we landed."

From Urubamba take a cab about 5-10 minutes towards Ollantaytambo. Get off at the Rainbow Bridge aka Puente Arcoiris (cab drivers should know this). This should cost you 5 soles if you lucky, 10 is alright in a private taxi or around 2 soles a person in a Collectivo, just be sure to let the driver know where you need to get off. Get off, follow the road and soon you will come to a hut and someone will greet you and you will pay 10 soles for admission. After that, just keep walking and you'll figure out the way. The walk/hike is about 30 minutes and there is snacks/drinks at the top, but you may as well pack your own. Return the same way you came!"

If you're looking for excitement, you're not likely to find it here.However, if you're interests lean toward historic, eco-friendly, resource extraction, you'll probably enjoy visiting Salinas de Maras.Water carrying dissolved salts flow down from the mountains to this location. Terraced ponds were created on the steep hills in Inca times. as the water flows down, it is diverted into various ponds. When they are filled, the water is diverted to others and the filled pond is left to evaporate the water, leaving the salt behind.The size and shape of the ponds vary greatly as do the width of the paths between them. Those are the ponds you walk on to negotiate your way through the field of ponds, as the locals go about their business of collecting the salt.Sometimes the paths are flat and wide enough to walk on with total comfort. sometimes they are quite narrow with high crowns, making walking a bit precarious. (Even though some of the members of our tour were into their seventies, none ever fell and, if they did, the ponds aren't deep enough to cause anything but embarrassment.Salinas de Maras, with its mosaic of pools, is an enchanting place, almost unearthly. As I descended the terraces I was entranced by the ever changing maze of the pools. Beautiful!"

The countless ancient pools of salt and saltwater are built into the side of a hill and are fed by a spring. The salt water from the spring is directed into intricate channels and trickles into the many pools where the salt accumulates as the water evaporates. There isn't much of a pathway between the pools so although the views of the pools are great, trying to get a photo of them without a bunch of other tourists in the way was nearly impossible. Also, navigating between the pools was challenging since there wasn't enough room for people to pass each other. On the drive down to the Salinas de Maras, there are a few places to stop where the view of the pools and the valley are truly amazing. A great place to visit if you're in the Sacred Valley."

It's quite the sight to see these salt pans, and the view of the Sacred Valley below is amazing, too. Include it in your trip!"

Each salt pan is owned by different families and are passed down to the different generations. Remember to walk slowly up and down the salt pans as it's easy to get out of breath due to the altitude. Keep to the path ways and do not step in the pans. Unfortunately, we were told by our guides that some tourists are ignorant and actually step into the salt pans for photo opportunities. There are gift shops that sell different types of salts and souvenirs."

Watching the people harvest the salt with crude implements and the backbreaking work involved as they broke up the salt, sifted it, and then sorted it was truly unique. Next, the salt was bagged into nearly 100 pound bags and carried up the hill to be weighed and shipped to the salt company for processing. The entire process from the flooding of the salt pools to the harvesting was fascinating."

I have been several times in many seasons around the year to Salineras and always it is new spectacle every single time!!Although some agencies offer this touristic place, mostly the big agencies as they have little time left, they dont show the travellers this amazing site...The comprehention of the Inca Empire and its core economy, goes through the knowledge that during Inca times and later when the Spaniards arrive, great amount of their whole economy was moved by the salt ponds extraction. Either way if you are someone who appreciate the culture, ecology, history, or just nature, not to say if you like photography....this place conveys so many aspects of the andean culture, you must experience... is just a must.... It is an amazing circuit that must be visited, special not in a big bus,,,, but , either by horse( I did it on the way up from pichingoto with an amazing company called \"Cusco for You\") and it was just something extraordinary... I felt I was in the spaniards times, and even thought about, what would have this guys felt once they arrive by horse to these amazing lands... I did it again in another year in a private tour, just for my husband and me..with \"Valley and Life Cottages\" where we stayed in one of their great houses in Urubamba, and where they offered us their private tours\"... I went with them in a car and by my own pace, with their amazing local bilingual guide, \"Octavio\" who showed us and explained us, the stories and leyends of the place, the plants and name and uses, and we had enough time to take pictures and go by our own... Only 1 thing is important, do not rush ... take 1 day to be in this amazing plateau, where Maras (the spanish settlement city was established) and where the extra-ordinary Inca Lab of Moray is... the last part is where Salineras is a total of 40kms circuit in total, that will take you like 4 or 5 hrs by itself... or maybe more....We ended our day having our amazing lunch in Morays Parador, that was included in our tour itinerary, that sealed the moment in an amazing day... ( I will review also this place later).... So if you are coming to the Sacred Valley dont miss this circuit... and also do it with the best!!!..."

My husband and I went with a private tour guide and driver and the visit was well worth it. Before descending down the mountain toward Salinas de Maras, there's a nice view of the many salt pools with the majestic mountains behind them. This was a nice photo op. At the tour site, there's a bathroom at the entrance which will cost s/ 1 sole to use. There are also many souvenir stands lining the entrance which sells the actual white and pink salt the community members collect from the salt pools. This is a great place to buy the salt, as they are at bargain price. I later found this same salt (packaged much nicer of course) in airport and other shops for much higher costs. Bring good shoes with grip because you'll be allowed to traverse around the various pools, which could be a little bit dangerous as the paths are very narrow and uneven. The pools seem to go on for quite a distance. You'll be amazed at how people still make their way to the farthest pools to harvest and haul the salt back."

I went in March and the pools were mostly dried up, but it was easy to connect the dots of how the salt is formed. The area is not patrolled by guards and so you really get to explore. The various colors are astounding. Totally worth taking a half day to do this. When I planned our trip people mentioned that it was easy to walk here from the main road. It's a big trek and you have to go along some really scary switchbacks to reach Salinas. I recommend a car!"

It was there from the times on Incas , they made rock salts this way , and still today the same process is going on, Saw a small steam is coming out from the mountain . I tasted the water, it was warm and salty, This water is collected in different pools of different sizes according to the landscape. . That is allowed to evaporate and form salt. Locals working there are collecting salt and making heaps, Some salt pools become very hard if not collected in time , Thar salt is used as bath salts by mixing aromas and color. I was really astonished at the site of the immense white areas with pools which are serving salt to mankind from the time of Incas, There are small shops where you can buy packets of rock salts and even bath salts .

I had on basic tennis shoes...something with traction is advised as you will be walking on 12 foot wide crusted salt walls with a 6 to 10 ft drop into one of the very shallow basins if you slip. It would likely result in a major sprain or fracture (I am an orthopedic surgeon), in a remote area where it would be difficult in the best of situations to get one out and to medical treatment.

By the time the water reaches the river below it has no salt left, as shown by the fresh water trout in the river.Interestingly you are allowed to walk around the pans on the narrow walls.There is of course a small retail outlet and it is interesting to see how many uses they have found for the local product.Well worth an hour or so of your time."

As we drove up the narrow road and the site began to some into view Cara noted that it looked like Santorini, the small Greek Island we were married on. The white pools of salt resembled the whitewashed roofs of the houses that dot the top of the Caldera in the small town of Oia. Upon entrance to the site you are forced through a narrow walkway with lots of touristy stalls lining it selling all types of souvenirs, including the salt which is not for human consumption, take note of that. They also have food and drink available for sale and seating that overlooks the site so once you have gone through it you can relax with a Cusquena (local beer) and marvel at the pools of salt drying below.You can actually walk down into the area where the salt is drying for great photo ops and a chance to feel the warmth of the mineral water that creates the salt. We had the good fortune to see people working some of the pools and bagging up the salt.This was the end of another day of exploring the wonders of the Inca Valley and seeing first hand their ingenuity."

The fact that you can experience it first hand is also a bonus. The salt pools are small but brimming with attractive salt crystals along the edges and a wide pallet of subtle colours that it takes a while to see and appreciate. Initially it looks to be shades of white, beige and even brown but the more you explore it and as the lightly changes on a cloudy day you will find more and more interesting things to see. These are working salt pools where local people harvest salt for their own use and to sell in commercial markets. Samples of the salt which is world renowned for its flavours and use in cooking and even medicines, are available for sale in the gift shops that are at the entrance. You are permitted to walk along the paths that take you through the pools and if you are careful and respectful there is usually no objection to visitors walking along the edges of the pools to move out to more remote areas although this is not without risk. The pools are shallow and you will see workers walking in them to clean and maintain them so that they do not leak and then eventually to harvest and bag the salts. When I visited this time there was a professional photographer from Lima who was balancing on the edges of the pools and moving across some very sketchy areas. The drop from one level to another is not great for the most part but some of the spots can be precarious. I watched one woman in a tall white traditional felt hat working in one pool near a larger drop while what appeared to be her daughter repaired a pool above her. The drive in and out can be a thrill in itself as the road is narrow and twisty as you work your way down the valley. It is well worth the time and distance to get there and you will end up with some great pictures."

We had directly left after flying into Cusco and were experiencing some altitude issues (strong headache, dizziness) during the day. For as much as we enjoyed the salt mines, the visit may have been better if we'd felt differently.There's a large area for souvenirs you walk through to/from the salt mines. You are free to walk around the salt pools. It was interesting to see the different stages of the process.After the visit, we stopped at the cafe on site for a bit of lunch. We shared an amazing club sandwich with avocado. The cafe seemed to be run by a family or friends-- very welcoming and attentive. Prices were very reasonable considering it was on site of an attraction. I would recommend this stop on the way to/from or as a day tour in conjunction with other sites. It is a bit small if this was the only sight you were visiting for a day trip out of Cusco."

Somewhere in the Inca civilization's history they concluded that salt was an essential component of survival. At the salt mines they designed a means to collect salt. Apparently salt is present in this particular mountain in unusually large quantities. The Incas found a spring / stream flowing from the mountain and constructed scores of shallow pools, then began to route the steam to fill the pools which, clearly not coincidentally, were built on the sunniest side of the mountain. After the salt water has filled the pools it is allowed to evaporate, leaving the salt to be harvested. We spent half a day at the Incan Salt Pools. This is an amazing demonstration of the ingenuity of these people. Although this activity is a long ride from Cusco, viewing this activity which continues on today with few changes from the past is easily worth the time and energy. Those with balance issues might have trouble navigating because you have to walk along very narrow paths with little room for error. As expected, there are plenty of souvenirs to acquire at the entrance. There is a charge to use the facilities at the salt pools. The road down to the salt pools should be driven only by a professional driver."

The first time I went was in 1984 or so when I was living in Urubamba. I had no idea what I was headed for. We hiked in from Urubamba which is steep at parts but not too long (couple of hours maybe). The views back into the valley were fantastic and suddenly you come upon this crazy place. The history of it is interesting and I will leave that to your guide but the place still functions the same as when it began. Since then I have been there so many times both hiking, horse trekking, and by car and it is always interesting. If you have the opportunity to see it once, I highly recommend it and if you don't have a lot of time, it can be done on the way back from the Sacred Valley and on the way to Cusco. I personally would not recommend it upon arrival to Cusco area because it is a bit higher and there is up and down which can take your breath away if you have not yet acclimated."

The ride down the cliffside to reach the salt pans is certainly harrowing, but the view is beautiful from the road as well as at the entrance to the walking area of the salt pans. We had a private driver take us there and I think it cost something like $7 to get into the area. Make sure to wear sneakers and be careful walking around this area. It is also on a cliffside and there are no traditional walkways . You must walk on the narrow stones between the salt pans... and they can be slippery. We watched the workers there collecting salt from various pans and carrying it up the hill. There are many gift shop vendors here selling all sorts of Peruvian trinkets /art and lots of salt. Surprise! :)"

First, stunningly beautiful plains and farmland to be followed by a curvy, winding drive. Yes, there are steep drops-offs as you approach the site, hairpin turns and yes... you must trust your driver (which we did). As with most sites in SV, access can be a challenge due to altitude, stairs, paths. While I had limited challenges descending - going back to the top was a bit challenging due to change in altitude (7ft above sea-level to 11,000+ ft. above sea-level) but I took my time had plenty of water with me and made it just fine. While you can see the beauty of the salt pools from above, by making the trip down you actually get to see the salinization of the spring that feeds along channels into these pools. You also can see a bit better how the salt is harvested. We were fortunate to have Cusco Local Friend guide, Percy, with us - he knew the right time of day to visit the site in order to avoid crowds -- we arrived later in the day on a Sunday. Well worth the drive and the climb!"

I did the hike from the bus parking lot to the salt ponds and back up, seriously vertical paths without railings, on a broken ankle with a cane. Groups of American teenagers were fiercely angry with me for holding them up. Other than that, prepare for no stairs but uneven earthen steps at irregular intervals. Down in the salt flats you will be balancing on 4 inch wide inter pond walls. No place for kids, toddlers, babies, disabilities, or depth perception challenged. There is an entrance fee whether you descend from the parking lot or not. It is worth the visit just to see the site. But if you have any kind of walking infirmity, do not even attempt it."

It also was quite interesting how the water was diverted into each pool and then cut off to allow the drying process. I tasted the water and it is quite salty. It is a bit of a hike though so bring plenty of water and wear comfortable shoes. You may also want to bring something for the headache you might have due to the altitude. The cocoa leaves I was told would help BUT the headache was there the entire six night stay in peru. Ibuprofen seemed to do the most good.

The Salt Pools was on my must-see list, but our tour guide said that there was a strong chance we would not be able to go because of the wet, road conditions. Fortunately, the weather held and we were able to see them and we were so glad! Personally, I believe that seeing them at that time of year was quite possibly the best time. Yes, the roads were rough and I can see how it would be much worse (and frightfully scary) if the roads were muddier and wetter. However, because we went this time of year the salt pools weren't crowded at all. There were no busloads of tourists on our heels, or slowing us down in front of us. Also, during high season, when the salt pools are drying and turning white, our guide said it can be unbearably hot. The small trails leading down to the salt pools are also narrow and I can only imagine how difficult it would be if there were tons of tourists about. Nobody stopped us as we walked down the many trails leading to the lower pools! Our guide said that this location has become so popular that they are in the process of building a better walkway or balcony, however, it will restrict people from getting as up close to the pools as we did, so we felt incredibly fortunate. Other fun factoids:-- According to our guide, Peruvians don't buy or use the salt from this area. Most of the salt there is exported to Asian countries that believe this salt is better because of the natural minerals coming from the mountain. -- According to our guide, there are 5,000 pools. Each family in town is given 40 pools to tend to. Pity the families with the pools at the very bottom of this huge mountainside!-- According to our guide, the large pool closest to the stores belongs to the local priest. However, he rarely ever has to harvest his own salt because the locals do it for him.Other things to be aware of...not handicap friendly. It's a bit of a walk down and that's the easy part. The hard part is walking back up with the altitude. Take your time and go slow. You can use the toilets for 1 sols."

It was quiet and aside from a sprinkling of other tourists we could wander at ease. It's a little stroll down and you are able to walk around the narrow canals that separate each group of ponds. Really picturesque surroundings. We visited with a private driver (ask your hotel if they can arrange one, as sometimes it can be much cheaper than a guide) and also stopped at Chinchero. I wouldn't make this a day trip as you may be let down, but if you can do a couple of places as well, I would definitely include this in your itinerary.Note that there are only stairs down to the main ponds, so it's not wheelchair friendly. You may also have to pay a small fee to enter (s./5-10 at most)."

I booked it with the Moray trip for an extra day since I had already paid for the 2 day Sacred Valley ticket for $23. I had to pay an extra $4 for Maras. It was an inexpensive way to spend an extra day if your time allows. It only cost about $10 for the transportation. It was about number 3 on the archeological day tours you can take from Cuzco. #1 Machu Picchu, #2 Sacred Valley, #3 Moray and Maras. The bus trip was comfortable but they stopped in Chinchero to try to sell you things at the end of the trip just like they did on the Sacred Valley Tour. If you are trying to pack in everything in a short time it may be advantageous to go to Bolivia instead."

Arriving in this fashion allowed our curiosity to grow as we slowly approached the valley holding the many salt pans. It was difficult to gauge the scale of how large it was until we actually arrived. Our horses were taken around to the far side of the valley, which allowed us the opportunity to walk through the pans for a first-hand look. Being from the cold white north, we couldn't imagine how we would negotiate the narrow white paths along the sides of the shallow pans of water evaporating to leave the salt behind. Our minds kept telling us it must be slippery, being hard and white like ice. Of course we were completely wrong, the salt gave us lots of traction for walking, and within a few steps we forgot our anxiety about how narrow the paths were. It was really great to get up close and see the various stages of the whole process. There was opportunity to purchase salt as souvenirs too. Don't miss it!"

In spite of the poor weather (rain) we felt it was worthwhile because the views of the tiered salt pans are so unusual.

But I will describe our trip out there so you can get a sense of how to plan for the trip yourself.The salt pans are a 1.5ish hour trip out from Cusco in the direction of Ollaytaytambo. We took our trip as part of our journey to Ollaytaytambo, and the private taxi that we hired in Cusco cost 150 soles for the entire trip. The trip included pickup at our Cusco hotel, drive to the salt pans, a wait for 30 minutes as we explored, and continue on to Ollaytaytambo train station. The salt pans cost 10 soles per person for admission, and are absolutely spectacular. Budget about 30-45 minutes of time for exploring, and 5 minutes on the way back up to buy yourself some salt as a souvenir.In case your taxi driver has no clue where to go (like ours), note that there are no clear signs once you turn off the main highway, so you would be advised to ensure your driver knows where he is going.

The ride to Maras salt mines is a pleasant one and one should take a 1/2 hour to stop in the colonial town of Maras itself with its cobblestone streets, quaint plaza, and beautiful colonial doorways. The salt mines reminded us of the area of the tanneries of Fez, Morocco except that here you are out in the countryside. The process of gathering the salt is fascinating and we enjoyed purchasing some bags of Andean pink salt as souvenirs. We were glad we made the short trip as part of our tour of the Scared Valley."

My tour guide Mario took me very close to the salt pools and we walked between each pool, while he talked about the salt making process. If you have an afternoon to spare, go to Maras town, have lunch there and then walk to the Salt mine. You can walk down to nearest town and then take the bus back to Cusco. If you have a full day then hike to Moray to Maras and to Salt mine."

The road is not for the faint of hearth. The site is out of this world. Imagine a very small stream exiting from underground where it has picked up a salinity of 70% and has been running for ages. The salinas is made of 3000 baths; each belonging to a family from Maras. They are no all in production but still belong to the same families. (no stranger can own a bath) It takes 15 days to evaporate the water (summer period only) and there are 3 different products: fleur de sel; regular table salt; and salt for cows (with impurities). It is a very tough labour: no gloves and no facial protection. A site to see with a guide as he will give you all the info needed."

A lot of people say they can pass on this site - but it was actually one of my favorites. It was just so different. I can say I have NEVER seen anything like it. First the drive is pretty crazy! The road is long, high and full of curves, single lane roads and cars/trucks coming at you. These drivers are super skilled! They have to be. The drive alone is not for the faint of heart! The actual salt pools are really neat. There were a few people working when we were there. I found it fascinating. We are both foodies and bought some salt on our way out. Would recommend it and do it again."

But the treasure these pools hold is unique in the world.World famouns PINK ANDEAN salt comes from these pools. The salt collects in the water, and water onstantly flows from top to bottom of the hill, washing over the salt. The purest salt is then \"filtered\", checked and processed into table salt. Apparently the salt is healthier for you than US table salt; there are much more minerals in the PERUVIAN salt. And the salt has a very pale pink color.This was a very interesting site to see - all of the salt out in the open, under the sun, drying. If you will be in this portion of the country, this is defintely worth a stop."

In the sacred valley, most of the sites are ruins from the Inca Empire.This salinas serves as a good escape from it if you are tired of the ruins.Below are two cheapest ways to go there if you are staying in Ollantaytambo.It takes more than half day if you do it slowly.Method one (this is how I did it)From Ollantaytambo, take a collectivo to Urubamba (Soles 1.5), takes around 30-40 mins.From Urubamba, take a bus (or collectivo) to a place called Ramal (Soles 2 if taking a bus). This is just a drop-off point along the highway. Takes around another 30 mins.From Ramal, wait for any cars or taxi which will happily take you to Salinas directly. Costs around Soles 10-20 depending on your negotiation skills. Takes just 10-15 mins to get to Salinas.Tickets for Salinas is Soles 7.You can walk around Salinas freely inside and take the same way back to Ollantaytambo with the above arrangement.Or you can walk around Salinas and go in one direction (NOT going back to the entrance) then there is a hill road all the way down the mountain. It takes just around 30 mins by walking and then you will arrive a little village.From the village continues following the path for another 10 mins (need to cross a bridge) and you will arrive the main road in between Urubamba and Ollantaytambo.From there, simply catch a collectivo back to Ollantaytambo (20 mins) or to Urubamba (10 mins) as you wish.Method TwoThis is even cheaper and quicker than Method One. I did not do it this way because I \"discovered\" this method only after doing the Method One.From Ollantaytambo, take the same collectivo to Urubamba, but tell the driver to get off at Arco Iris Del Puente (pictured attached). It takes around 20 mins and you will get off before arriving at Urubamba.Walk towards the Puente (bridge) and cross it.Continue walking past the small village.Then there is a hiking route go up the mountain (on your left).Follow the route and this will lead you to the salinas. The hike should take less than one hour. Not difficult. (this route is indeed the one that I said in Method One that leads down)You will soon arrive the salinas.After visiting, simply walk back the same way.By doing Method One, you need a few transport changes but no need to walk / hike at all to the salinas.By doing Method Two, you only need ONE transport and no one check for tickets (this is what I observed while I was there). But need to hike up (easy one) for more or less 1 hour.Hope this helps!"

There are thousands of squares for harvesting salt here and when you look at it from above, it is just very neat to see.The salt comes from water from the mountains. It sits in the pools with the sun beating on it until the water evaporates and you are left with salt. There is a machine used to separate the salt from the sand and the whole process I was told takes about a month.Very neat site, worth visiting if you are on a tour or driving around since this is one of the sites you will likely see along with the Moray and Sacred Valley areas."

For thousands of years, it has been evaporated, and used by people. It is collected now much like it was in antiquity. The water is manually diverted into small ponds and the sun does the work. People break up and flatten the ponds with their feet and when full, they are allowed to dry and are then bagged and carried up the hill on a persons back. It really is interesting."

It's just amazing to think that this is in the middle of the mountain ranges, and just surprisingly to find a salt production area.Just a little touristic when we arrived there. Wandering around the salt terraces may be a little difficult due to the limited space to walk on. But it's an experience worth to try."

The colors of the ponds were various colors from white, cream, tan, and pink. I had some difficulty walking down to them because I was older and had problems from altitude sickness. Next time I would take the altitude sickness pill and purchase a small $10 canister of oxygen from their local drug store. That would have been a lifesaver. The road to the site was narrow, and could barely accommodate 2 buses to pass, but we had excellent drivers. The road in the country too us through grain fields where we saw small children working in the fields watching as their sheep grazed. Little shepherds with dogs."

            "review": "Interesting, but best seen BEFORE MP. I first visited Peru in June/July of 2013, the winter season in Peru. Here are my thoughts:PROs:- winter in Peru is the dry season and better for climbing (see via ferrata adventure and Putucusi Ladder) and hiking (during the day)- the salt mines are interesting and I enjoyed walking among the mineral pools and watching a local mine one for the salt- It's cool if you enjoy history or viewing natural processes- when sunny, the weather is warm enough to enjoy with a light coat or heavy sweaterCONs:- this site isn't awe-inspiring nor is there much to see; it's a salt mine. I think we spent 20...30 minutes there. Don't go out of your way to see this only. Spend a day to see this and surrounding sites; otherwise, it's not worth the time. - It's far from lodging and other attractions (45+ minutes)- very cold at night; after sundown around 5:00, the temp plummets and it's miserable - don't plan to view anything after 5pmRecommendations: 1. Stay in the valley at least one night. It's absolutely gorgeous. 2. See these sites and any others of interest BEFORE you climb Machu Picchu; otherwise, everything else in the area is anti-climactic. 3. There are tours that combine this and Moray, the agricultural tertiary system. I recommend doing one of those, or do what we did: hire a taxi for the day for about 120 soles and go to both Moray and Moras/Salinas and another site in the valley. We went to 3, all about an hour apart. We originally wanted to do the bike tour, but couldn't due to failure to meet a minimum number of participants (I think it's 5), but the taxi worked out better since I was sick as a dog and slept between sites. For itinerary and transportation advice from Cuzco to Machu Picchu, see my review on the Peru Rail/Expedition train to Machu Picchu. Thank you to all who have posted and helped me enjoy truly awesome vacations.Hope this helps return the favor! Happy traveling! "

Each small pool belongs to a family and has been passed down through the generations. Yet, there are enough for new families in the community to obtain for free, as part of the cooperative. I hired a private taxi and the drive was breathtaking through mountainous farmland and snow capped peaks in the distance! The drive alone was worth the trip. The final road is a narrow dirt road and the driver must take care. Upon the approach, you can look down on the mine fields from very high above. Once you wind down the road and park, there are a few restaurants and quite a few craft stands to buy various qualities of salt and other hand made textiles. You must walk through the maze of shops to access the path ascending down to the pools of salt. This is the point where a closer view of the many pools will astound you! There are a few workers and owners gathering the salt and you can watch how they work. The pools are various shades of white, pink, and brown. In late August it was very hot to walk around. Once you get to the pools you are allowed to walk anywhere, but the footing in very precarious as you are walking on the lip of each pool. Wear boots that won't mind stepping into the salty water if you loose your footing! Aside from the natural beauty of the man made pools and the contrast of the white salt against the earth, the panoramic view of thousands of pools ascending down the mountainside below you and the mountains shooting up in the background will take your breath away! Because of the heat and the limited ability to walk far, you can visit the Moray ruins, right up the road. This is one of the highlights of my trip, because of its ancient roots and incredible beauty."

We climbed around and followed the paths between the flats. Tasted the water (very salty) and even geocached. Pre-reading about the history was very helpful to know what is (and was) going on.

This may be because we had a wonderful guide who told us the history of the area and also explained how the local people use the salt pans now.

The site costs 7 nuevo soles and requires you to walk down several sets of stair cases to view the pans themselves.

You've seen the pictures, but to see the site firsthand is really very cool. I have seen salt flats in the Caribbean before, where they flood a huge diked field and then once evaporated move the massive amounts of salt with a bulldozer, but this site was even more spectacular due to the immense amount of individual pools, all hand worked, terraced on a hillside. Here they sit on the side of a mountain, deep in a ravine, and the +/- 4500 pools ( numbers vary; Eyewitness guide book says 3000 but our driver told us 4500 ) cascading down the steep hill is quite impressive. The drive there will take you past some incredible scenery, sprawling, rolling fields which end in snow capped majestic, high mountains. Then there's the one lane dirt decent road that takes you down to the entrance on the edge of a cliff with several blinds corners:)So what we did was hire a taxi from the plaza in Olly to take us to Salinas, Moray, and Chinchero, waiting at the sites, and then delivering us to check in to our hotel in Cusco. We had no trouble finding a willing driver, and the price paid was 150 soles. It could have been bargained down further, but we thought this a fair price for what was going to be 6 full hours of traveling time ( not including his return trip home ), which turned out to be exactly what it was. He stopped for us to take photos along the way, and spoke decent enough English. He also pointed out relevant facts and highlights along the way which was nice."

It's simply amazing how extensive this place is and because it's out of the way you're unlikely to see many tourists here. It's almost like a cross between Pamukale in Turkey and the tanning baths in Morocco which I've visited several years ago. A visit to the site should take about 30 minutes and is well worth the journey there from Cusco. Entry to the site is 7 soles. There are two ways to get there: The first is by taxi, which should cost between 20 an 25 soles including waiting time from the turnoff to Maras; The second is to go it on foot which should take the best part of an hour and a half each way from the turnoff, though I wouldn't recommend it as the scenery isn't very interesting on the way there. There are tours from Cusco that visit the Salinas, Maras and Moray for a reasonable price (can't recall how much they cost). However, it's very easy to visit Moray and the Salinas by yourself and it will work out cheaper than the tours if you go in a group. All you have to do is take a collective bound for Ollantaytambo from Avenida Pavitos (5 minutes from Plaza de Armas) for between 5 - 10 Soles and ask to be dropped off at the \"ramal\" to Maras. There will be colectivos available to take you to Maras, which is 4km away, for 1 Sol or you can negotiate a trip taking in Moray and Maras for about 40-45 Soles which will include waiting time (whole trip is about 2.5 hours). I you're really hardy then you could walk from the Ramal to Moray (about 10km) and then to the Salinas (the turnoff is about 2km from the ramal), though this would take all day as it's about 30km all up."

From a small spring-like stream coming out of the hillside, hundreds of salt pools capture and contain this precious source of commercial salt.

Operated as a village commune, each salt pool is allocated to a community family to be tended as a source of income. The collective pools are controlled and maintained by the collective and the result is a fascinating scene of salt, salt crystals and pools in various states of evaporation. This creates the colour variations that make this into a kind of crazy quilt of colours. There is a gift shop with crystals, fossils, local crafts and refreshments.

I was impressed that the locals have been drying the warm salty water that comes out of a spring here for centuries in hundreds of shallow evaporating pans cascading down a valley. These pans have been continually in use since Inca times. The best time to visit is in the dry season when there are more of the salt pans that are white from the drying salt. I was there in the rainy season so not as much white, but it was still impressive and photogenic. There is a small entrance fee for visitors. You can see the place where the warm salt waters comes out of the ground, and dip you hand into the water and give it a taste - really salty. The water flows by gravity through a series of channels and is let into the pans. During the dry season it takes about 20 days before the salt can be harvested. There are a few shops where you cab inexpensively purchase bags of the salt to take home as great gifts. Plan to spend no more than an hour."

There is a little town nearby called Maras but we just drove through it and there's nothing much to see there. The salt mine is what everyone comes to see. We decided to come by ourselves as oppose to going with a tour as we did not manage to book one in time. And I wanted to try in this last full day in Cuzco if I could travel like a real local / smart tourist. Based on my research I thought we would try to get a local bus to Urubamba (only costs like 3 Soles I think) and followed a city map to where the bus station is. However, we never found the station but in the same area there were lots of \"combis\" (carpool taxis) accosting passersby to take their transportation. One of these combis in an alley way off the street offered to take us at 7 soles each if the car fills up to their full capacity of 4 people. There were 2 of us. At first I wondered how long it would be to find 2 other people who happen to want to go to Urubamba as well but that was no trouble at all. Within a few minutes 2 locals showed up and jumped in the car with us. To go to Maras & Moray one has to travel towards Urubamba and then ask the taxi or bus to drop you off at the junction where the the road to Maras & Moray meets the main road to Urubamba. Based on the description in the travel advice I found, this was easy to spot. There is a bus stop at this junction and there are a bunch of taxis waiting around to take tourists to Moray & Maras. Once we got dropped off a taxi drive came up to us immediately to offer his services. My travel guide said that to hire a taxi for 3 hrs should cost around 50 Soles. Although our taxi driver agreed to this price, I think that that in hindsight we could have probably gotten it down to 40 Soles. 50 Soles is a lot of money in Peru. We were taken to Moray first which is the furthest site of the 2 from the junction. If you didn't get the Boleto Turistico for the Sacred Valley sites (70 Soles for entrance into Ollantaytambo, Pisac, Moray, & another site combined), it's just 10 Soles to enter Moray. After Moray we went to Salineras. Salineras is tucked into a deep but narrow valley / ravine that cannot really be seen until you're right on top of it. Entry into this site is only 7 Soles. The site is beautifully eerie and reminds me of one of those futuristic movies where there is some prison camp mine. If you've never seen a salt mine up close this place is worthwhile to visit. 3 hrs to visit Moray & Salineras together is perfectly sufficient and you can head over from Cuzco and be back within about 4-5 hrs. We left around 9:30am and was back in Cuzco by around 2pm. It's only 30 km away from Cuzco and the scenery you will be treated to is worth it on it's own. You can get a great view of the surrounding mountains around the Sacred Valley very well. An Australian lady we met at Moray asked to share our hired taxi to go to Salineras and back to the junction. We thought that since we were hiring the taxi by time, that she can just chip into the total cost. But our taxi driver would not agree to this and insisted in charging us more for the extra person. In the end he agreed to take her on for an extra 15 Soles. Keep this in mind: All negotiated transactions must be agreed upon upfront. New terms cannot be accommodated later. Once we got back to the junction at the main road, we thought we would try to get on a local bus or combi which ever was available and cost efficient. A very full bus came by first but we decided not to get on. We thought we'd wait for the next bus that supposedly came by quite often, but an empty combi taxi came by and offered to take us all the way back to Cuzco for 5 Soles each!! Wow!! The 3 of us jumped in and soon after another lady was picked up. After almost 2 weeks in the Cuzco area we finally were paying for taxis at the local rate. Lesson learned. All in all Moray & Maras is a perfect half day excursion out of Cuzco. Would highly recommend. Just look up some travel guides either online or in a book for more detailed explanations of the sites. You don't need to go with a tour."

The Maras salt ponds are an interesting place to visit, and probably worth it because of how easy it is to see if you have just spent time at Moray. It probably does not rise to some place you would drive a couple of hours to just on its own, but you are likely already stopping at the crop terraces in Moray, so swing by Maras directly afterward.Basically, it is a giant salt mine that has been built into the side of a mountain. Salt-rich volcanic water comes down into the salt area where they have built small channels to direct it to one of the hundreds of ponds that are built below. When one pond fills, they close the channel there and direct water elsewhere until all the ponds are filled. What you see is a stunning set of ponds that are of varying colors depending on where in the process that pond is. If you go in June or July, the ponds will all be pristine. If you go in October or November, the ponds might have different colors as the rains will bring mud into some of the ponds.There is a tourist shopping area built around the attraction. The same tourist stuff that can be had elsewhere is all there. We did not really shop, so I cannot comment on prices. They do offer tastes of salted food for free, and they sell that food. The roasted corn, banana, and some other stuff was pretty tasty. We grabbed the bananas as a ride-along treat to our next destination. As driving can be long, this is not a bad idea. And grabbing water is never a bad idea.The site itself features some walking with some stairs. Overall, it is not very difficult, but people with particularly bad knees might find the walk a little bit tough on the way back up. But other than the fairly injured, everyone should be able to enjoy the site.Make sure you get a photo at the pull-off site on the way down to the mines. It offers the most complete photo opportunity.And be aware that if you dip your hands into the ponds, they will be salty. If you are careful about water, you will need to have a bottle of water to wash your hands with before eating other things.There was a small fee at the gate. I believe it was 7 soles per person, guide excluded."

            "review": "awesomely surreal sight. We came here as part of our visit to both Moray (the concentric circles of Inca agricultural laboratory terraces) and Salineras de Maras. There is a little town nearby called Maras but we just drove through it and there's nothing much to see there. The salt mine is what everyone comes to see. We decided to come by ourselves as oppose to going with a tour as we did not manage to book one in time. And I wanted to try in this last full day in Cuzco if I could travel like a real local / smart tourist. Based on my research I thought we would try to get a local bus to Urubamba (only costs like 3 Soles I think) and followed a city map to where the bus station is. However, we never found the station but in the same area there were lots of \"combis\" (carpool taxis) accosting passersby to take their transportation. One of these combis in an alley way off the street offered to take us at 7 soles each if the car fills up to their full capacity of 4 people. There were 2 of us. At first I wondered how long it would be to find 2 other people who happen to want to go to Urubamba as well but that was no trouble at all. Within a few minutes 2 locals showed up and jumped in the car with us. To go to Maras & Moray one has to travel towards Urubamba and then ask the taxi or bus to drop you off at the junction where the the road to Maras & Moray meets the main road to Urubamba. Based on the description in the travel advice I found, this was easy to spot. There is a bus stop at this junction and there are a bunch of taxis waiting around to take tourists to Moray & Maras. Once we got dropped off a taxi drive came up to us immediately to offer his services. My travel guide said that to hire a taxi for 3 hrs should cost around 50 Soles. Although our taxi driver agreed to this price, I think that that in hindsight we could have probably gotten it down to 40 Soles. 50 Soles is a lot of money in Peru. We were taken to Moray first which is the furthest site of the 2 from the junction. If you didn't get the Boleto Turistico for the Sacred Valley sites (70 Soles for entrance into Ollantaytambo, Pisac, Moray, & another site combined), it's just 10 Soles to enter Moray. After Moray we went to Salineras. Salineras is tucked into a deep but narrow valley / ravine that cannot really be seen until you're right on top of it. Entry into this site is only 7 Soles. The site is beautifully eerie and reminds me of one of those futuristic movies where there is some prison camp mine. If you've never seen a salt mine up close this place is worthwhile to visit. 3 hrs to visit Moray & Salineras together is perfectly sufficient and you can head over from Cuzco and be back within about 4-5 hrs. We left around 9:30am and was back in Cuzco by around 2pm. It's only 30 km away from Cuzco and the scenery you will be treated to is worth it on it's own. You can get a great view of the surrounding mountains around the Sacred Valley very well. An Australian lady we met at Moray asked to share our hired taxi to go to Salineras and back to the junction. We thought that since we were hiring the taxi by time, that she can just chip into the total cost. But our taxi driver would not agree to this and insisted in charging us more for the extra person. In the end he agreed to take her on for an extra 15 Soles. Keep this in mind: All negotiated transactions must be agreed upon upfront. New terms cannot be accommodated later. Once we got back to the junction at the main road, we thought we would try to get on a local bus or combi which ever was available and cost efficient. A very full bus came by first but we decided not to get on. We thought we'd wait for the next bus that supposedly came by quite often, but an empty combi taxi came by and offered to take us all the way back to Cuzco for 5 Soles each!! Wow!! The 3 of us jumped in and soon after another lady was picked up. After almost 2 weeks in the Cuzco area we finally were paying for taxis at the local rate. Lesson learned. All in all Moray & Maras is a perfect half day excursion out of Cuzco. Would highly recommend. Just look up some travel guides either online or in a book for more detailed explanations of the sites. You don't need to go with a tour."

The fees for entry at Moray and Marasal are very modest. We arranged the trip through the very excellent husband and wife team at Peruvian Travel y Turismo near Plaza de Armas in Cusco, Luz Marina and Enrique, at www.peruviantravelyturismo.com. Very reasonable cost, very knowledgeable and kind. Highly recommended as an alternative to booking through a hotel. Would work well also if you were returning to Cusco as an intermediate day before or after Machu Picchu. They also organize Inca Trail tours that sounded great and also at a reasonable cost."

Then, it\u2019s a considerable hike to get down to the salt pans. But there are hundreds of salt pools where they produce a delicious salt. And the salty water comes from a natural spring somewhere inside the mountain; and it is warm. A very unusual natural wonder. Simply collecting the salt into bags and hauling them up the hill is a task for the people running this. After taking all of this in, it\u2019s the hike back up that will get your attention as it is somewhere around 12,000 feet"

The scale is amazing, the basic concept so simple, and seeing the different pools at different stages was really informative.If you want to go deep into it the paths get very narrow and a bit slippery - at one point I had to perch on a small rock while an entire coach-load of Japanese tourists filed slowly past along the narrow path - but if you're nervous about this you can still get a good impression from the higher ground where the paths are much wider and less slippery"

The mine is beautiful with mountains in the background. There are vendors at the site, so you can buy some of the salt products. You might want to negotiate prices. Also, there is a very small church on site, which is neat to see.

About half an hour drive from the Sacred Valley of the Incas in the town of Urubamba are the interesting salt terraces of Maras. Underground springs passing through subterranean salt mines (thereby extracting salt minerals) spill over the top of a hill and unto ditches that are directed to a coutless number of terraces where the briny water collect, settles, and evaporate leaving salt deposits and crystals. The salt terraces are owned and maintained by a cooperative union comprising of about 200 local families. The salt comes in two grades, the white premium grade and the salmon colored \"roseadas\" which contain traces of clay. One can tiptoe or walk carefully and slowly among the many terraces. At times, one can see workers harvesting up to 80 kilograms of salt per sack and carried to a nearby storage building. An interesting activity is to have a taste of the briny water trickling down on the terraces. It is a fascinating site to see. If one has some time available at the Urubamba area of the Sacred Valley, this is something worthwhile visiting and seeing."

You should look down from a viewpoint on the access road - geometrical patterns in white/beige/pink within barren brown surroundings (during dry season). If possible, arrange for a walk down to the sacred valley, to be picked up by your transport there. This allows you to get away from the crowds and visit the lower parts of the salinas where less people go. The walk itself to the valley takes only 35 to 45 minutes downwards and brings you to interesting arid landscapes, to a hanging bridge over the Rio Urubamba and to a restaurant where your driver may be waiting in the parking lot."

We really enjoyed our drive though the impressive Urubamba range of mountains and the high, snow-clad peaks as we drove to Moray, and then on to Salinas de Maras. You will find many wonderful photo opportunities even before you get to the visually stunning salt mines. Maras Salt Pools are an impressive complex of salt ponds, located in the area known Qoripujio. History goes that the locals were a angry at the Incas, so they invoked the Sun God and asked him to punish them. So,the Sun sent a rain of salt over that land so that it would become infertile and would not produce any food. He also made the water of its rivers salty so that the people could not quench their thirst. Perhaps the Gods thought ahead in the future because the curse became a blessing to the Inca Empire, and the current 380 families of Maras and Pichingoto as they are the only ones allowed to work these salt mines. It is a really enjoyable trip, you can get up close and personal walking along the salt ponds. Depending on the time of year, and the rain the pools will be either brown or white. There are stairs, and it can be difficult to navigate if you have a hard time walking. The salt pond themselves can be walked on freely, but they are slippery, so beware."

Our first stop was this location, and its a very interstingly built 3000 salt pools. There is a natural salt water spring coming from the mountain and has never stopped producing ever since the Incas first used it. There was a theory that the SV is once under sea water level. This is a nice and unique site to visit while in SV and make sure you ask your guide to stop before the bridge to take a snapshot of the SV with Urubamba river as a background. Also on your drive to the location, stop by and take pictures on the farm fields with the mountain ranges as background, very nice! Maras is not covered with the turistico boleto so plan ahead of buying the ticket (you can also pay it on the site). Take time to wander around and actually go close to the salt pans."

There must be literally thousands of salt pans here. All of the terraces have been engineered by hand into the side of the canyon over hundreds of years (as far back as pre Inca times). The salt here is not mined. A stream flowing through the mountain (which contains the salt deposits) is diverted into shallow terraced areas where it dries in the sun over a period of days, then is raked into piles, bagged and sold by individuals or families. There are many small vendors between the parking lot and the salt pans selling crafts, food (in small outdoor restaurants) and packages of salt they have collected from the pans. The walk from the parking lot to the salt pans is very steep - watch your step. This is a private site (not part of Peru tourisms tourist card), so there is a separate fee to pay at the toll booth on the road (a steeper fee than any of the Peru tourism official sites, but not that much - is it worth the fee - I think so, now that I've seen it)."

Basically there is a salt water source that flows (like a brook) and they made terraces for the water to be channeled on to so that the water can evaporate, leaving behind the salt which then can be gathered. Since at ay given time some or most of the salt will have been gathered already, it would be hard to see the terraces filled with white salt, which is what would give the place a visual appeal. Instead, the terraces are mostly earth-colored patches of dirt.

Ladies in dresses are out working the mines was neat to seem amazing that they dress up for this kind of labor. It's in the middle of the mountains, we did a hike down to \"town\" where our bus picked us up, easy hike except it was a narrow pathway at times (and not sure I'd want to hike up, that would be strenuous). Also near the bottom of the pools is the shed where they take the harvested salt to, those bags are big and heavy. Biggest complaint I had was that the gift shops where they sold the salt were at the top so I would have to buy before I saw it, although if you didn't hike down I guess not a problem. The bus ride in was a bit white knuckled, if you don't like steep cliffs sit inside and don't look out.

Luckly we met local people who gave us direction and short cut to Salinas. It you walk from Maras, there are two road; paved and unpaved dirt road. Paved road takes twice more time to get Salinas. It takes about 40-50 minutes on walking through unpaved dirt road. The scenery all the way from Maras to Salinas is amazingly beautiful and impressive. The Moray is not too far from Salinas (7 miles). It would be better to visist both sites in one day. Most of pools of Salinas are owned by people of village of Maras."

I had previously seen a video of the salt mines and it was great to actually see them in operation and appreciate the difficulties under which the locals operate. This is an interesting place as it is no where near the sea, the salt comes from the runoff of the mountains.Access to the salt pans is via a private road with a fee applied by the owner of the property and also another fee to actually enter the site and view the operations. However these are not expensive.The trip in and out calls for concentration by the driver/tour operator as the roads are dirt, windy, narrow and very steep. You can see the works in operation and how the salt is collected and carried(50kg) on the backs of bare footed salt workers. If you wish there are plenty of shops selling all types of salts(including pink salt), foods, drinks and the usual tourist nick nacks. Well worth the visit."

There are literally thousands of tiny pools that they use to trap water and harvest salt in a natural, ingenious fashion. It supports many of the local families. You can to literally walk along the edge of the salt pools - it is a nice departure from the ruins and landscape you generally see in the Sacred Valley. They have some nice souvenirs to get (salt, assorted corn, textiles) for simple gifts to friends/family."

Then a superb and stunning walk down to the Salineras along a clear path (about 3 miles), and continue walking back down to the river (another mile or two). Cross the bridge and get a combi back to Urubamba or wherever. Take water with you. There is a cafe and toilet at the Salineras.

I would HIGHLY recommend finding a biking tour if you are in ok shape and a fan of biking. Even though my wife and I hadn't ridden a bike in 10 years, it all came back to us and we had an absolute blast! The bike tour ended here. It is at the end of a long and dusty narrow gravel road (which was terrifying on bike with tour buses blasting past). At first, high up on the hill, you can't even tell what it is. But as you get closer you see that all of the white is salt. This is an ancient salt mine! There is a small trickleof water that becomes a small, salty stream. The Inca built the baths to capture the water and let the sun evaporate the water and leave behind the salt. It is very cool to see. You can walk among the salt baths (not in of course!) and the locals still mine it. You will probably see them down there scraping salt. I don't think I would pick this as a destination alone but it is great as part of a tour. Seriously, I recommend biking there. It was just a bit chilly (spring) and just a gorgeous ride through small villages and ending at this impressive salt mine."

This is a unique tourist attraction - it's a bit pricey to get to, and entrance is S7 by taxi (the only way if you don't walk), but if you're fairly fit, you can get a moto taxi for around S1.5 to the bridge about 10 minutes from Urubamba town, and walk about 40 minutes up to the salt flats, without having to pay entrance fees. Salineras is not included in the tourist ticket that you may get from Cusco - so by car you would have to pay separately. If you just want to see Salineras, and are not bothered/don't want to pay for Moray (which is normally toured simultaneously), I would recommend this route to save money. To get to Moray, you can walk another 1.5-2 hours uphill to Maras and get a return taxi for around S25...but there's not a lot to see in Maras town, so it might be better to try and get a taxi from Salineras itself...some taxi drivers are rather misleading, saying that there aren't any taxis to Moray from Salineras, but that is definitely not the case. Although, if you're planning to see Moray and Salineras, it may be better to get a bus from Urubamba to Maras, and then get a return taxi to Moray before walking from Moras to Salineras downhill instead of up."

On street 'Au Grau' there is a bus station where you will see busses with Urubamba on. Jump on one of these for 4 soles and ask to get off at Maras. The locals were really helpful and considerate in helping me, so you should have no problem getting there. The Journey takes about an hour as the bus intertwines the stunning landscape.When you get to Maras you should see a number of taxis waiting here. I negotiated a round trip to Maras town, Moray and Salinas salt pans for 60 soles. I had thought about walking it, the landscape isn't challenging but the total distance including all sites here would be around 35km.When you are done visiting the sites, go back to the turn off for Maras and flag down a bus that is going the opposite direction back to Cusco again 4 soles.So in total I did this for 68 soles, don't let the public transport put you off because its cheap and fun and extremely easy to do."

Visually, it's a unique experience. It's kind of crazy just to see over 1500 little ponds filled with salt water that will eventually be \"harvested\" by a local family in charge of the place. But really, there's nothing to do here other than snap a few pics and walk down the steps to get a closer look. So let's not go overboard with the 5 star reviews.If you have an extra day to blow while in Cusco, then I would recommend doing a Chinchero/Maras/Moray combo trip (which would take you about 6 hours or so, all in), just so that you can say you did it and so that you have some neat pics. But I wouldn't sacrifice a day to do this trip. There are alot of other things you could see and do in or around Cusco that I would say were cooler. Heck, I probably had more fun hanging out on the 2nd floor balcony of the Starbuck's that overlooks the Plaza de Armas and people-watching. :)ps remember that like most places here, they charge 1 sole to use the restroom!"

There are shops at the beginning with some tasty treats, but we did not see anyone offering to be guides, so not sure we got out of this experience all that we could have. I had done some advance research, which was helpful. It is not easy walking in the salt mines, so if you have small children or poor balance, I'm not sure how far in I would venture. I had read varying accounts of how to get to this place; in the end, the driver took us right to the entrance and you don't have to walk far at all; I had thought we might have to walk up to an hour (which would not have been worth it). We went in the morning, it was certainly interesting to see, but had elsewhere read to go in the afternoon for fabulous colors. This place is \"off the beaten track\", driving on dirt roads to get there. It was interesting to walk into the site and see the different stages of work going on, and by the far side looking back, it looked like an iced bundt cake!We hired a taxi for the day and had him drive us around the Sacred Valley; as the buses all follow the same schedule, this meant we were able to go to sites when the buses weren't there. It was awesome to be able to do this (we had many sites practically to ourselves), we spent as much or as little time as we wanted at each place, and had no \"forced\" shopping experiences that others told us about. Highly recommend this approach (it cost more than bus tickets, but I'm sure we saved money in the markets!!!). The taxi was also able to drop us off at one end of a site and pick us up at another spot, so we didn't have to backtrack."

Best to hire a guide up top for a few soles to learn the history and process of 'harvesting' the salt - quite fascinating.

No guides and no rules, you can explore the entire area. The water running into the ponds from the hillside is intensely salty and the sources for the mineral. Workers were out in the pond area following the process of collecting this precious Peruvian salt. Apparently anyone willing to follow the rules and can identify an open pond can work it. There are multiple shops selling all forms of the salt and other typical crafts. My thought was to buy the packaged salt that has not set in the sun and caused condensation on the package. The salt is heavy, make sure you have the weight allowance in your baggage for the trip home."

I'm not great photographer but the contrast between the brown dirt and the white of the salt pools is really stunning.Plus, I scored points on the home front by buying my girlfriend bath salts."

We are not the tour type and saw buses up on the hillside and thought they must have been missing out as they were so far away. As we were walking thru, a guy came up to us and said we needed a pass - we had not heard about this, but paid a minimal amount to get the pass - looked pretty official. Perhaps we were taken advantage of but who cares was very worth it. My wife remarked that as we walked along, it looked like icing on the cake. We watched people work raking the salt, and others walking their donkeys along the road. Probably like they have for many, many generations. If you want to go back in time and see simple, do not miss this. Not to be missed is the hike up alongside a small cemetary."

The Maras salt ponds were not even on my sightseeing wish list before the trip, but they certainly ended up being one of the highlights.When I was planning the trip, I tried to include as many archeological sites (a.k.a. ruins) as practical in the limited time we had. However, the reality is that after Machu Picchu, all the other ruins are quite unremarkable, and frankly I started to find them boring. Fortunately, we had a wonderful private guide who adapted our activities on-the-fly to include attractions that were more interesting. The guide suggested the Maras salt ponds, and I am so glad she did! The salt ponds were very unique and interesting, and they really added some variety to our sightseeing. (The guide was from Peru For Less, and we were very pleased with their services throughout our trip!)Anyway, the salt ponds are quite a ways off the main road between Urubamba and Cusco. I\u2019m not sure how you would get there if you weren\u2019t with a guide. The ponds are tucked away in a steep little valley. Hundreds of years ago, people discovered a natural salty spring, and the started building small evaporation ponds to harvest the salt. Over the years, more and more little ponds were added. The spring still flows today, and now there are thousands of little evaporation ponds all over the hillside.It\u2019s really a very spectacular place!Some people seemed to just view the ponds from an observation area near the gift shop. However, in order to really experience and appreciate the ponds, you need to walk down to where the ponds are. There is a pretty easy level path that goes along the top row of ponds. You can walk quite a ways out onto the hillside on this path, and see the ponds up close.There didn\u2019t seem to be anyone out there who was really paying attention to how far about amongst the ponds we walked. If you have plenty of time, you could probably walk all the way down towards the far end of the sea of ponds, but I don\u2019t know for sure. Maybe someone would eventually stop you, but it would be fun to see how far you could go. That\u2019s what I would have done if we had more time.Obviously, you want to be very careful of the ponds and the maze of tiny canals that feed them. This is a working salt farm, so it\u2019s important to not interfere with the operation. But from what I observed, they didn\u2019t seem to have any problem with us walking around the ponds respectfully and carefully.One thing you definitely want to do is to stick your finger in the water from the spring and taste it. You\u2019ll be surprised as how salty it is!Don\u2019t forget to go through the gift shop on your way out, and support the local economy. The items they sell are very cheap for us, but even our smallest purchases mean a lot to the locals. I always try to buy a little item of some sort everywhere I go.Anyway, I strongly recommend that you don\u2019t miss this place. Make it a sightseeing priority, and have fun!"

Located just a few minutes from the Moray Crop circles, Salinas de Maras are a group of still-functional salt pans still used for extraction in modern times. Admission is separate from the other sites in the Valley and paid at the gate directly to the company that manages the site. The descent is a bit intimidating and thrilling at the same time; maybe three feet separate your car from the cliff on the way down. There is a visitor\u2019s center at the bottom that you pass through on your way to the mines proper. Most tours will start by the hot spring at the top of the pools (that \u201cfeeds\u201d the operation) and then continue down into the dozens of miniature lakes (\u201csalt pans\u201d) that spread down to the valley floor. There is quite a bit of autonomy allowed with your route here; our guide brought us well into the field of pans before ascending to the top. It\u2019s a bit of a balancing act between the pools although not slippery and we didn\u2019t come close to losing our footing. There were still workers visible on a Sunday with the harvest which was interesting to watch. After about an hour of slithering around between the ponds we returned to the main entry, bought the requisite souvenirs, and were on our way.This was similar to the Moray circles in the sense of being more of a visual journey than a thorough learning experience but was valuable none-the-less. I would imagine a professional photographer would be overwhelmed with all of the opportunities. The shops had a different variety of items including (surprise surprise) salt for cooking and various decorative figures made from the mineral as well.

A small trail leads to them, the salty water coming from a spring inside the mountains.We are told that the mines are a co-operative farming system, perhaps even pre-dating the Incas, where anyone could own a pond, but had to operate it within strict guidelines.The pans range from being brown, ochre, white, depending on how much water or salt each one contains.They look beautiful in the evening light."

We took a taxi from Urubamba for our visit - after several miles of dirt road travel (after leaving the main road), through beautiful high open vistas, with mountains all around - we pull up on the crest of the hill and see THOUSANDS of salt pans. Like nothing I have ever seen! It was such a contrast to all the Inca ruins we had visited. The ride there was a treat in and of itself - breathtaking. It was quite hot, so we eventually had to leave - it would be interesting to visit during the time of year they actually collect the salt. We did read of a trail that can be followed from outside Urubamba to walk there - I think that would be quite nice, actually - and also read of one that runs from Moray to Salinas (which is the direction one would want to go - downhill!). If I had an entire day to dedicate to this, that's what I would want to do - and just soak in the amazing peace and views. But absent that, a taxi is the way to go - no crowded tour bus necessary!!"

Horseback riding to Salinas de Maras was a great different option for our family with two teenagers. The trail is a bit steep with a narrow path, therefore I would recommend that you are comfortable with horses and not afraid of heights. Just need to trust the horse, as they do it everyday. The salt terraces are beautiful and our guide was very informative and kept the interest of both kids. We chose Cuscoforyou, it is rather pricey for the outing, but the horses were healthy and the guides were very professional."

The road going down in to the Salt mines is freaky in a big bus, but car, van or motorcycle it is simply spellbinding. Once you are down as far as you can drive, you are free to walk down in to the sediment pools, taste the salt water and chip away at the salt crust. I love this place because it is not regulated so much that it is sterile to visitors like Yellow Stone Park, where you can't step off the pavement. This is a working salt collection area but you are free to walk around and check things out as you wish.It is about 90 minutes out of Cusco but there is a ton to see along the way.

It's somewhat esoteric -- seeing how salt was mined during Inca rule -- but the scene is absolutely spectacular and it's amazing to see them still in use today. It is like no other tourist attraction you will ever visit.Don't pay attention to the books that suggest taking combis or collectivos to get here. You'll want a taxi, at the very least from Urubamba but probably from Cusco. We hired a taxi from Cusco to take us to Pisac and Maras (waiting an hour at each), then drop us at Ollataytambo, for just S/.140 (for a total of 5 hours of services). You can likely get a taxi directly to Maras for S/.50 from Cusco, but you'll have trouble getting back out. There are some taxis that await people at Maras, but I would prefer not to rely on them alone.Anyway, this was probably our second favorite attraction in Peru (Machu/Huayna Picchu #1), and gives a great feeling of going beyond the typical tourist traps.One note: the \"path\" is not well-defined. Just stay on the high side of the mines and work your way across the top. There are miners there, but they will usually just ignore you or say \"bienvenidos.\" If you have poor balance or a severe fear of heights, you may not enjoy this attraction."

A young girl, whose momma works in the gift shop let me take her picture. It was wonderful both coming and going, we got to see men coming in with their harvests on the backs of mules, and women walking their sheep into the plains."
