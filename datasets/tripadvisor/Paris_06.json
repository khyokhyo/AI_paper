You can venture to Saint Michael square for some expansive views and tourist action or venture deep into the Latin Quarter for some historic streets with lots to do and eat. In many parts of Paris once 8PM hits, you are hard pressed to find things to do. In this area the action goes on until the wee hours of the morning. We love staying here so we are close to a lot to do at night and have close walking distance to many of the most famous Paris attractions."

There is much to recommend a leisurely visit to St. Germain de Pres, including an ancient church and cafes where the the likes of Hemingway, Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir, Oscar Wilde, and others sat and talked ... and wrote. Les Deux Magots is one of them, along with Brasserie Lipp and Cafe de Flore. If you are a history buff, this is a great area to explore. No, the literary greats are no longer there, and perhaps there are more people from the fashion industry than the arts, but still, it gives some of us a thrill to think of Papa sitting at a table pondering the words he would shape into A Farewell to Arms."

The beautiful 19th century buildings and boulevards are stunning and home to some of the swankiest names in retail. Add to this the ancient churches such as St Sulpice and St Germain and you have a whole morning or afternoon of pleasure in a small area. There is even a Marks and Spencer for the anglophiles!

A Parisian knows this as well as any tourist, and that's probably why some of the wealthiest Parisians and expatriates choose to live here. You'll notice a wide selection of expensive shops and upscale bakeries. You'll also notice the natives looking you up and down, quite a bit. This was the only place in Paris I had a stranger on the street randomly say something rude to me (for NO reason). She said it to me in English, and I wish I had the sense to reply in English. Instead, like a good tourist, I tried to reply in French, and was only able to eek out a weak and passive-agressive \"Merci\" before she scurried into the crowd. And around the more famous areas there are crowds. I used to have some romantic sentiment for this area, but in the future I will likely avoid it."

This was an excellent area to stay in. Lots to see and do in that area, but also convenient to get to various other areas of Paris.From our apartment, we had 2 different Metro stations, on different lines, within a two block walk (Saint-Germain-des-Pres station on line 4 and Mabillion on line 10. With those two options, we could go nearly anywhere within Paris, either directly or via transfer to another line (or to the RER). Within the Saint-Germain-des-Pres area, we mostly walked (there are many different shops and restaurants within walking distance) or, for points a little further (or if we were very tired) took the Metro.Some of the places to see in Saint-Germain-des-Pres include Jardin du Luxembourg, Eglise de Saint-Suplice, Eglise de Saint-Germain-des-Pres, Musee Delacroix, and more. Shopping options inclue La Grand Epicerie de Paris / Le Bon Marche along with many different options for clothes, shoes, lingerie, chocolates, macarons, pastries, and much more.Just a couple of the many dining options in the quartier include Restaurant Allard and Bistrot d'Henri.If you pick the right spot to stay in Saint-Germain-des-Pres, you can find yourself in a quiet tranquil oasis in the middle of Paris, but just one or two blocks walk to the hustle and bustle of the quartier! I highly recommend this area as a place to stay within Paris, but even if you stay elsewhere, be sure to come check out the shops and restaurants."

If you want to feel like a glamorous Parisien(ne), head to St Germain des Pres on your bike on a Sunday afternoon and plonk yourself down on the terrace of one of its many bustling brasseries and order yourself lunch and a coffee and watch the world go by. If you fancy, you can then cycle up to the Sorbonne, past the Jardin de Luxembourg, down to Notre Dame or across to the Louvre and up the Champs-Elysees! A fab spot to take in the grandeur of the city!"

It is centrally located, has enough \"tourist\" services and benefits but also has a local feel to some of its side streets and shops. In three different hotels in the area, we were about 15 minutes walk to Notre Dame, the Louvre, and other nearby attractions. It felt very safe, especially this trip when there was a noticeable presence of armed guards patrolling the streets, particularly near the attractions. Metro and bus stops are strategically located for ease in transportation to other parts of the city.

This section of Paris is filled with Brasseries, Cafes, restaurants, unique little shops right on up to stores such as Louis Vuitton....It would have been very easy for us to spend our entire 10 days in Paris in St. Germain and never leave although of course we made to enjoy all of Paris! St. Germain is loaded with character with its ornate building fronts and doorways right through the people! If you don't stay right in St. Germain de Pres, be sure to at least spend a half or full day taking in the sights and spending some time wandering around the streets!"

The feeling is real parisiens, many restaurants, cafes, bakeries filled with local people and tourists. Bohemian atmosphere, artists, exhibitions, paintings, museums, parks, souvenir shops, food markets, churches etc. Not to much touristique but you feel yourself as real parisien. Watch the local - drink a morning's cafe, read fresh newspapers, smoke, chat on phone. For those who want to stay here - just 1 block from Seine River, 10 minutes walk to Notre Dame and Louvre you are just in the middle of everything. If we go again we will choose Saint Germain without a doubt"

You can shop, buy some local art, they have beautiful flower shops, you can see Notre Dame see go to the cinema or just enjoy all the beautiful people walking by. This is really what I thought Paris would be like. The buildings are just so gorgeous and you can find everything you ever wanted in this charming place! To think of all the people that fell in love with Paris the exact way that I did. I wish I could have had more time here and I can't wait to go back!"

We booked for an evening business meeting of about 20 and the restaurant accommodated is easily as the seating plan is really flexible for large or small groups. There's a lot of history to this restaurant but they don't rely on that and the quality and service are excellent. I had the escargot to start and they didn't disappoint and followed with steak and crime br\u00fbl\u00e9e, all amazing and clearly prepped and cooked with great care. The staff were really attentive and they have a great wine list . Not the cheapest option in Paris but not the most expensive either and the opportunity to sit where Hemmingway and others once did was an added thrill, it's pure 'old' Paris."

If I ever lived in Paris for an extended time, I imagine myself living in this quarter.The main street within Saint-Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s, completed renovated by Haussmann and as important as the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es. There\u2019s plenty of shopping to do here with less of a touristy crowd and wonderful cafes to hang out in. I absolutely adore this area and would always return here just to hang out and people watch.Paris is a city, yes. And Saint-Germain is no small district. But time and again I\u2019ve always stumbled upon quiet squares and enclaves that is both romantic and charming. One of it is Rue de Furstenberg which was an amazing hidden gem that is miles apart from the busy boulevard off the main street. Mus\u00e9e Delacroix is also located in this lovely square, celebrating Delacroix\u2019s works from the romantic age. The museum was converted from the celebrated artist\u2019s final residence. Delacroix\u2019s most famous piece is the Liberty Leading the People (this piece is displayed at the Louvre-Lens) depicting the French Revolution with a woman symbolising liberty holding up the French tri-colour flag."

Saint Germainites live and breathe an acutely postured history, which for the passing tourist is fine, but goes only so far in my opinion.

Take most streets and you will be pleased with the mixture of businesses and everyday life, with the rue de Buci having the concentration of restaurants and probably the rue de Seine having the largest of small galleries. There is a good grocery store (Carrefour) in the middle of the neighborhood if you are staying close by, with stalls of fresh food right outside on rue de Seine. It is peaceful in spite of being in the middle of Paris, and you feel the neighborhood's distinct artsy vibe when you step into it from any side.

Well, the left bank is actually the entire south side of the Seine River. If you stand with your back to the flow of the river the area would be on your left hand while places like the Louvre, Place de La Concorde, Montmartre and the C hamps Elesee are on your right. The Left has a bohemian reputation and feel to it. It is the home to the Sorbonne, Paris' University so it has a very young feel to it. Boulevard St. Germain and Boul.St. Michel intersect just a few blocks away. It has very old colorful neighborhoods with narrow winding allies and streets off both sides of Boul. St Michel between the river and Boulevard St. Germain. It is the part of Part of Paris that I can spend hours walking through and sitting with a cup of coffee and people watch. Cafe Les Deux Magots is a historic cafe that sits right across from the beatuiful and historic Church of St. Germain des Pres. There are plenty of other great cafe's and pubs also to enjoy the crowds and yes there is great shopping here, though not so cheep as it once was."

One block from the Metro and Saint Germain des Pres, 2 blocks from Notre Dame Cathedral and Saint Michel. This is the oldest part of the city (I think). You really have to hunt for the small medieval area of tiny streets and ancient architecture, but it's worth the search. You're also really close to the University so there's a lively student community feeling. It's a bit of a walk to the Luxembourg Gardens, but not if you walk fast. Get off the beaten path of the main streets and you'll find all kinds of great little cafes, bookstores and restaurants - without the overpriced Saint Germain or Saint Michel boulevards themselves. There's an interesting outdoor \"museum\" of Roman ruins, inside of which is a Museum of medieval Jewish life and artifacts. I love this area, there's an ambience of \"closeness\" (as opposed to the wide open Champs Elysee, for example)."

Our mission was to have brunch at Les Deux Magots which we had failed to find on previous visits. This time we were successful and the walk took us along quite a stretch of Rue Saint Germain which is a really buzzy area - but there is even more action in the side streets between Rus Saint Germain and the Seine. Just across the road from Les Deux Magots is the stunning old Abbey of Saint Germain des Pres. Large parts of the old abbey were destroyed in the fires of the revolution - it is just over1 km from the Louvre and the Tuilleries which were also burned at the same time. The lovely old church was open - with very few people walking through and as we walked through we could hear this ethereal chanting from the front of the church. There was a small Taize group worshipping in a small chapel singing simple chants and reading from the scriptures and it created a very special atmosphere inside the vast space. It is worth dropping into this church. We then continued our walk down to the Seine and worked our way past Hotel de Ville looking for the well known pet shops on the right bank - which we found. All in all a pleasant days activity and we were able to soak up the atmosphere of the left bank in the process."

We found a great array of restaurants, cafes, boulangers, up-market shopping opportunities, sports stores, bookshops, art outlets and souvenir shops. If you happened to be a fan of the Paris-St.Germain Football Club, there were plenty of opportunities to purchase some of their supporters\u2019 merchandise.The area obviously has great drawing power for tourists as the streets were alive with people whilst we were there. The people ranged from elegant Parisians promenading in their fashionable attire and many, many tourists like ourselves through to some people who were obviously \u201cdown on their luck\u201d.The Saint Germain des Pres Quarter is certainly a worthwhile area for tourists to visit on the Left Bank. If you happen to be an avid shopper, then you should really enjoy yourself there."

Some of Paris' very early and historic cafes are here but visitors need to shop around to obtain value for money. The journey is neatly concluded at the St Germain church - a historic effigy dating back to the 9th century. From bridge-to-church the walk is about 2 hours at a leisurely pace but there is always time to stop for coffee and just soak in the atmosphere and the huge cross-section of pedestrians strolling by."

Saint Suplice, for example, sponsored the voyageurs who over-wintered in Norfolk County, Ontario and famously produced the first wine in the region (and perhaps in North America)."

The whole area is dotted with fine shops, restaurants, and Brasseries (many too expensive for what they serve, IMHO; we paid about 22 Euro for one small, one large beer at Lipp).

I would say it's also good for shopping (although that wasn't something we did). I like that it's a busy area but didn't feel crowded like some other areas of Paris. The main tourist attractions are all easily accessible from the St. Germain area. We used the Paris Velib (bicycle) service and this was a great way to get around. There are lots of museums in the area, including the Rhodin musem, Musee D'Orsay and others. It was nice to spend the day touring around but then to come back to the St Germain area in the evening. There are plenty of restaurant options within easy walking distance and a caf\u00e9 at every corner."

We stayed 8 days at Citadines St Germain but this review is not about the hotel but about St Germain.This was a first lengthy stay in Paris and to stay in the 6th arrondissement at St Germain was perfect.St Germain is close to all the iconic attractions of Paris, you are vertically on top of Notre Dame, a short walk to the Louvre, a shorter walk to the Luxembourg Gardens a good walk to the Eiffel Tower. If walking is not your thing you are close to St Michel Metro and RER station.St Germain has a vibe, a feeling, you can spend you evenings just wandering the streets feeling safe and people watch, sit in one of the many cafes and have a coffee or enjoy a great meal in fine restaurant.The perfect place to stay in Paris."

The buildings are unique and the people are extremely friendly. This area seems to be far less touristy Champs Elysees. We really enjoyed our tour in Saint-Germain."

You are walking distance to the Bon Marche and the Bon Marche food court for some real fun. There are many other small shops to nose around in. Most important there are several metro stops for the different lines that allow a quick above ground walk from becoming a long underground walk for connecting lines. The caf\u00e9 in the picture for this site has the worlds best chocolate- it is like drinking brownies!"

If the Paris of your dreams is that of the artist and cafe culture of Hemingway and his cadre of Lost Generation expats, then this is the home-base for you. While it has most certainly been gentrified since Hemingway's day, it still retains the bohemian flavor that sets it apart from the glitzier right bank neighborhoods. Any visit to Paris must include some time spent sitting in a sidewalk cafe in Saint-Germain-des-Pres, and one could spend hours, or days, in the restaurants, cafes, shops, and gardens in this neighborhood. It is a perfect,centrally located home base that has a good balance of authentic Parisian flavor while still being safe and accessible for almost any tourist."

So, I saved so much on the shopping that I was able to do, that I had money for other things!! The streets in this area get more narrow the closer you get to the river.

And it did drastically cut my list of things to do. However, I did use taxis and hobble well enough to see the book stalls on the river, the oldest church in Paris, eat & drink at Le Prix du Clercs, see Les Deux Magots (the rumored cost of a cup of coffee kept me from sitting down - my speed was more Le Prix du Clerc) and the brasserie where Hemingway often ate and Woody Allen showed at least the outside of in \"Midnight in Paris\" (they are kitty-cornered) across the boulevard. I loved the area and even so feel cheated and want to go back as soon as I can. I also made it to the Musee d'Orsay and will write about it separately."

This area on the Left Bank was once at the forefront of the city's intellectual life in the 1950s,a nd still has major publishing houses located there. The area is now shared with high fashion, where one can find spots like Yves Saint Laurent's posh premises. There are many good restaurants, cafes and movie theatres. Famous restaurants like Les Deux Maggots, Cafe de Flore and Brasserie Lipp can be found in Saint Germain. Wonderful musuems like the Musee d'Orsay (ranked #1 Paris attraction on Trip Advisor) are located in this area. Want a different type of museum? Try the Musee Nationale de la Legion d'Honneur, where one can learn all about the Legion of Honor, a decoration launched by Napoleon I and cherished by French and foreigners. Napoleon's Legion of Honour is on display here. Other decorations, such as the British Victoria Cross and the American Purple Heart, are also featured here. Try Le Procope, which claims to be the world's coffeehouse, founded in 1686. Patrons included Voltaire and Napoleon. Quel history!"

Luckily I found a lovely flat (via airbnb) right behind the St Germain church. The metro stop is on the opposite side of the church. I couldn't have asked for a better location. You can, if you're inclined to see more, walk to; the Louvre, Notre Dame, lock bridge (removed my lock and all others!), and more from here. There is a nice street market area about a couple of blocks from the church where you can find restaurants, markets, and other food. There's a Paul bakery which has an absolutely delightful country bread. You also have L'avant Comptoir nearby which is a must stop. We ate there 3 of the 5 nights we were in town."

We stayed at Hotel Pont Royal on Rue de Bac, just a short walk from a Metro station, 10 minute walk to the Louvre and d'Orsay. In Paris, the Metro is the key to getting around, so the choice in where to stay depends on your choice of hotels. This is a great neighborhood, and where we have decided to make our home in Paris."

There are many charming neighborhoods in Paris, but this suits us best. Put on your walking shoes and cover one end of Boulevard Saint Germain to the other. Almost every cross street is worth exploring-towards the river or towards Saint Sulpice and the Sorbonne. Much of this quarter is pricey, but with a little planning you can find restaurants and cafes that won't break the bank. Try Marlotte, a fine bistro on Cherche Midi which we have been frequenting for years. We prefer Bonaparte to Deux Maggots for a cafe with some decent food and a nice mix of locals and transients. Les Climats, on the backside of the Dorsay, deserves its Michelin Star and is a worthy place for a splurge. Plenty of one of a kind shops on the side streets if shopping is a passion."

This is a great restaurant and shopping pedestrian-friendly neighborhood and a great way to end your day visiting the left bank.

If what you're looking for is \"old Paris\" scattered with nice restaurants, shops and artists, St. Germain is where you want to stay. We did an apartment-share, which was authentic and enjoyable because we felt a part of the community. We had hundreds of delicious cafes, patisseries, boulageries, and bars within walking distance. The metro runs right by and you can take the train directly from Orly International Airport nonstop in 30 minutes. The stops are St Michele and Notre Dame. There are a few chain restaurants, try to avoid those. Most people spoke English but it's more fun to try some French. There were plenty of tourists but it still retained its French charm. Notable walkable attractions include Notre Dame, the Louvre, the \"locks\" bridge, Jardin de Luxembourg, the justice building, and many other things. St Germain is located on the Rive Gauche, or Left Bank of the Seine."

If you like to walk along the river, (who doesn't?) there's that as well. And then Of course there's Jardin du Luxumbourg which is a DO NOT MISS. But save it for a day when there are blue skies. Get off your feet, get a chair or two, and rest! So yes, the area has cafes, people watching, lots of tourists, but get off the main drag and enjoy the sights & scents. DO NOT GO ANYWHERE WITHOUT A MAP.

For me, it was the perfect introduction to Paris."

There is one area in Montrmarte like this, but ALL of Saint Germaine area is like this. The antiques here are museum quality. If you people watch, you'll notice that there are few cameras hanging around necks, like other areas where tourists walk and tour buses dump crowds. Shopping and eating here is enjoyable without the throngs and hoards of pushy herded travelers."

Yet, despite that, it seems to be a lively area for locals: cafes, night spots, boutiques, etc. Although some of the restaurants seemed touristy looking, the food was actually good and authentic. We ate mostly in that area since we were staying there. we had a variety: crepes, seafood, cafe food for breakfast, etc. There is a street market right outside the Maubert-Mutualite stop (10 train) that makes the area charming.

It's a great locale to visit churches, art galleries, boutiques, and famous cafes like Les Deux Magots were Hemingway huddled with other passionate writers. It's accessible from many metro stops. And you can walk here from Notre Dame on the banks of the Seine. If you wander through the streets between Boulevard Saint-Germain and the Seine you can view ancient Paris--the winding atmospheric little byways where Victor Hugo may have meandered as he pondered his characters for Les Miserables. It's also a marvelous place for people watching and mixing with \"real life\" Paris."

Inside, it's a serene and peaceful break from the busy streets outside. I visited on a Friday morning in April, and was treated to music from the church's wonderful pipe organ, which blasted throughout the open space of the church.I was there at around 11am on a Friday. The crowd was not large, and there was plenty of room to move about, sit, and meditate. This place is near to many other attractions, and is a no-brainer half-hour visit while you're in the neighborhood.One note. It's free to enter and look around, but they are asking for donations for restoration of the building. Do your part to help preserve this wonderful piece of Parisian history and drop some Euros in the box!"

Locals say this area has been commercialised and is very touristy. That said, I think many local Parisians still do spend time here and that's nice. It is close to the Latin Quarter which is certainly where the tourists flock too, and not my preference but St Germain des Pres is lively and vibrant without being a tourist trap. I would consider staying in the area on my next visit."

There were marvelous window displays in the stores. One of these displays, in a stationery shop, prompted me to duck in and sort through antique prints. Further down the street, I shopped for souvenirs and greeting cards at another little store.If you're in this neighborhood, take a few minutes to visit Ste. Sulpice church -- or at least the fountain and plaza in front of the church. The rococo architecture of the fountain lends itself to photography, especially if you capture an image of a pigeon perching on some of the statuary."

There was a snow slide for youngsters, a ski slope for skiers, a stand where a young woman was making raclettes (warm, melted cheese on baguette slices) and distributing them to passersby.

Be careful of the Gypsy girl pickpockets posing as tourists asking for directions with a map in hand , they work in twos , have you up against the wall reading their map while the other one is taking stuff from your handbag. They look like real tourists just like you..be careful . Don't be put off going there , just be careful and don't help anyone asking for directions with a map"

It was essentially a pop-up store with about 70 pieces from a private collection. Don't expect to furnish your apartment with this furniture unless you are a hedge fund manager, but as a fan of Grey, I enjoyed the experience and the manager was very friendly even though he knew I wasn't a buyer.As for food, this is an expensive area to eat.

I always felt safe and was close to many great attractions. Here a few tips if you should stay in this area. There is a nice grocery store with many pre made take out dishes, including cooked chicken. It is the Monoprix at 50 rue de Rennes near Cafe de Flore. It doesn't look like a grocery from the street, but if you go down the escalator and through the clothing to the back you will discover an area where the locals shop with decent prices. You also can dine there and get bread from a bakery. Speaking of bakeries you must visit Poilane made famous by Julia Child. They also have Poilane bread at the Monoprix. There are great second hand stores called Cherchemineppe on rue Cherche Midi. My friend got a steal on a vintage Hermes scarf. Visit Luxembourg Gardens. Some think it is the most beautiful. Don't miss the Medici fountain. Walk by Procope, the oldest restaurant. Also visit St. Sulpice church. It is where the rose line is made famous by the movie and book The DaVinci Code. I would stay in this area again in a heart beat!"

This is a lovely area of Paris, filled with wonderful shops, restaurants, museums, markets, patisseries, churches, bars, art galleries ... and the list goes on. I often hear people say that this quarter is \"too touristy,\" but it is touristy for a reason. Much exists for tourists to see and to do. Two of my favorite churches loom here -- Saint-Sulpice with its Delacroix frescoes and St-Germain-des-Pres, which shows off a mixture of styles, including an 11th-century bell-tower. When I'm in Paris, I sometimes get food to go from one of the shops on nearby rue de Buci (a market street) and eat in a garden behind St-Germain-des-Pres. Les Deux Magots, Cafe Flore and Brasserie Lipp stand nearby. Though historically interesting, these establishments serve only average food at high prices. When I want to sit at a cafe, I head to Cafe de la Mairie in front of Place Saint Sulpice. I like the ambiance of the shade trees and the church view better than the atmosphere at the more famous places. And about a block away, Pierre Herme with its famous macarons and chocolates beckons. In the opposite direction, the beautiful Jardins du Luxembourg signal a place of respite from the throngs of people on the sidewalks.It is possible to wander aimlessly through the district and never be bored. But I recommend picking up a walking guide that includes a tour of this area. A couple of possibilities are \"A Paris Walking Guide, 20 Charming Strolls\" or \"Walking Paris.\" The district is easily reached by bus, metro, and, depending on where you're staying, on foot."

Famous in early post second-war era as a meeting place for the likes of Hemingway, Scott-Fitzgerald and Sartre, the boulevards bustle and fizz with trendy bars, street cafes, sophisticated designer shops, museums and markets. Linger for a while.The famous Deux Magots (where Hemmingway was said to do his writing) offers a fine vantage point to people watch. Wander down the boulevard and loose yourself in the the chocolate heaven that is Maison Georges Larnicol chocolate shop. Boulevard Saint Michel cuts across Saint-Germain so hurry to the square and eat your chocolate before it melts! Tip: Very crowded in July and August"

Great area to use the Velib (almost free bike system). TIP: Visit Musee d'Orsay - buy tickets on line and get a double pass to Mus\u00e9e de l'Orangerie as well. Its cheaper that way and the other museum is just over the river. The Luxembour Gardens is a great place to bike to - bring food as there is not much available in the gardens although there are cafe's around the gardens. Hotel Quai Voltaire is on the Seine and just down from the Musee d'Orsey and there is a Velib docking station oposite - excellent location.

It is a bit pricier to stay here, but if you can afford it, I highly recommend it.

When I was a student in Paris in the sixties, I was walking around three areas: Montmartre, and of course in the Latin Quarter, rue Mouffetard and rue de l' Odeon in the saint Germain des Pres area. Montmarte because that is where the love of my life lived, otherwise despite its charms I found it a bit too devoted to tourism. Now I am a wild tourist myself so I should be more understanding... . The rue Mouffetard was an absolute jewel, you still had \"bougnats cafes\", bougnat stands for people from the Auvergne who opened shops and cafes in Paris, where they sold coal and drinks. A hidden working class street smack in the middle of a most praised area in Paris. An ideal location for poor students, with an atmosphere of the early 1900's. And then the rue de l' Odeon. We lived in a one room \"concierge apartment\" 10 rue de l' Odeon. Next door was 12 rue de l' Odeon where, for half a century people like Scott Fitzgerald, James Joyce,Hemingway, Gertrude Stein, Alice Stoklas, Henry Miller and many others were coming at Sylvia Beach's iconic \"Shakespeare and Company\" bookstore. What an atmosphere, so many world class monuments, galleries, restaurants, day and night...........why did we leave???? (well we could not afford it maybe :( and we wanted to see the world. I went back often to Paris since, but each time for conferences, family reunions, I did not have time to visit casually my old student haunts, after more than fifty years.... Well Montmartre had not changed, still charming if you could erase from your mind the hordes of tourists. Rue Mouffetard was an absolute disaster. Instead of the \"bougnats\" lots of shops selling t shirts with \"I love Paris\", Banana Republic, McDonald and so on. Nothing wrong with these stores per se of course, but not in the location of my dreams. Fortunately rue de l' Odeon had not changed, and Saint Germain des Pres was still as I remembered, I walked through it for hours, stopping here and there at a caf\u00e9, not so much for a drink as too look at the crowds, happy Parisians and happy foreigners who did not look like tourists even if they were, great art galleries, great everything. Maybe because of its history it is a place where American intellectuals can feel at home in Paris. Elsewhere in Paris Americans intellectuals join the club of French \"provinciaux\" and other riff raff foreigners who do not belong and are told so."

This area is filled with French literary history being the site of Cafe de Flore, Les Deux Magots and Bistro Lipp. Don't worry about being a tourist - practise your French beforehand and take your place among the ghosts of writers past. I have always found the French wonderfully sympathetic with my French tinged with an Aussie accent - they respond in impeccable English! Saint-Germain is home to the most amazing charcuteuries and boulangeries so you can always pick up provisions to take back to your apartment to be washed down with some house brand French champagne from your local Nicholas bottle shop for 16 Euros. Forget all the hype about the Marais - personally I think it's grotty - and find an apartment of hotel in Saint Germain. I can't wait to go back to see my \"old friend\"."

We found so many little restaurants and neat shops everywhere. The energy of people was almost electric. It was touristy, but for me, the mix of people was incredible. We bought a cup of vin chaud, and it was amazing....we went back for thirds.

A walk during the day is nice and at night, with the city illuminated, is precious.The area I\u00b4m talking about is the 5.o and 6.o arrondissements. There are plenty of department stores and alternative shops (the up scale shops are in other area), very good not expensive restaurants and brasseries (my favorites are: Brasserie Balzar, Petit Pontoise and Che Fernand restaurants), some boutique of just small and cosy hotels (try the hotel Des Grands Hommes or the La Sourbonne boutique hotel). I think that this area is what is considered the Latin neighborhood, \"Quartier Latin\". It has also the Luxembourg gardens, the university La Sorbone buildings, the Patheon, the Middle Age Museum, the Notre Dame church, to mention some of the interesting places to visit.It\u00b4s my husband and my favorite area in Paris. We try a different hotel every time we visit in order to choose the best spots. On Saturdays there is a small precious street market that sells vegetables, cheese, bread, foie gras and other foods, as well as incredible African masks. We never miss it when visiting the city."

It is very trendy and a great place to explore. Restaurants are open early in the morning and close late in the evening. The nearest metro would be Saint Germain des Pres, Odeon and Saint Michele."

Up the hill you will find the Pantheon, the Sorbonne, the University of Paris and on top of the hill the Luxemberg Palace and the Park that surrounds the Palace with statues of the Queens of France a huge collection of flower gardens and a pond for your miniature sailboat.Between the boulevard and the river is a great collection of boutique hotels, street caf\u00e9s and restaurants.

St Germain has it all: classy apartments, interesting places to eat in great variety and endless shops to explore and browse. It is a great place to take first-time visitors to Paris. The other thing of course is proximity to Jardin de Luxembourg. Towards the St Michel area, the other bonus is all the book and music outlets of Gibert Jeune.Paris is great for picnics on a fine day: explore the area but take some ham, cheese and tomatoes and pick up some crusty bread. Jardin de Luxembourg cannot be beaten in the general area."

St, Suplice Church, featured in The Da Vinci Code, is in this neighborhood and we checked it out one of the times we walked though. A local told us that before the movie, this church was kind of forgotten. Nice to see that it has so much interest now and is being appreciated. So many enchanting little alleys to wander down and discover food and shops. We loved a soap shop where we could have a piece cut to order. The smells were divine.

We stayed in Saint Germain for five nights and only began to experience all that this area has to offer in terms of cafes, restaurants, sights and shopping. We had a number of good meals here and took part in the very Parisian activity of people watching from a side-walk facing table at Cafe Bonaparte. It can seem a bit comical to see the patrons all facing toward the street instead of each other as if they are seated at theater, but just go ahead and do it yourself and you'll see an incredible parade of people, fashion, and dogs go by. We watched young woman arrive by scooter with an enormous backpack. She left for about an hour and then returned and put mallets into the seat compartment and we realized that she was carrying a huge base drum in her pack. Did she have a lesson? A performance? Who knows, but that was just one of many intriguing moments we experienced. To be sure, if you are not a smoker, you'll find sitting outside at the cafes to be a challenge as smoking is allowed at outside tables. And seating is incredibly crowded and your drinks/snacks will be astronomically expensive. But this is life as theater and you'd be remiss not to enjoy it at least once. There are many good shops as well to explore with merchandise that goes beyond the usual touristy fair. This is thriving neighborhood to stay in or visit for an afternoon. Our hotel was the Bel Ami."

Saint Germain used to be Paris' intellectual meeting point and its caf\u00e9s are proud to announce Jean Paul Satre & Company used to meet up sitting at those very tables. However, today the place has become a little too posh, with plenty of high-fashion shops at caf\u00e9s that sell an expresso for 6 euros. Nevertheless, you'll find plenty of unusual, fun places to hang around and a bunch of interesting art galleries."

Lots of well-reviewed bistro are also in the area, why would I stay anywhere else.The flat we rented on Rue de Seine had most of the food places I wanted to eat in within less than a 1km radius, don't forget proximity to my favourite sites. Here, you would walk or take the Velib to get around everywhere. I also took a food walking tour of Saint-Germain-des-Pres (www.parisbymouth.com) and I was told that anyone who's anyone in the food scene must have a presence in Saint-Germain to be taken seriously. I certainly would believe that. Where else would you find Patrick Roger, Pierre Herm\u00e8s, Le Chocolat Alain Ducasse, Patisserie des R\u00eaves (just to name a few) in the same area?"

Around the back streets of this quarter, Paris seems unchanged from my first visit 50 years ago. Buildings remain the same with their ornate wrought iron balconies decorated with geraniums, small brasseries (albeit with a few Pizzerias thrown in nowadays) and many cafes where we lingered over a coffee. This quarter is still rather quiet and seems a million miles away from the right bank of the Seine with the hordes of tourists. Highly recommended."

Beside of the most famous quartier Montparnasse, there is one more equally reknown quarter, that is, Saint-Germain-des -Pres Quarter. It is located in the 6th arrondissement.And what is more important, the glorious Sorbonne University within the Latin Quarter is in the neighborhood, a little bit to the east. That was really spiritual refreshment for me, to see such abundance of bookshops, galleries of art, little bistros, small museums, numerous churches and major among them, the Paroisse Saint-Germain-des- Pres. When I was walking along the streets of such cultural and philosophical inclined milieu, I remembered instantly the two giant figures of the movement of the existentialist, that are, Jean Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir.Also You may enjoy in the many musical venues and in the evening concerts of the chamber music in the churches, as St.Germain des Pres and St.Julien.The cafes and restaurants are also present here in its variety and number.Really pleasant part of the City of the Lights."

Saint-Germaine on the left bank is really in the 6th arrondissement.The Latin Quarter ( the 5th) is just to the east so there are many musical venues and small museums and hundreds of galleries. Many churches, including St. Germaine, and St. Julien have concerts nightly. Theses are young, talented musicians who are given the opportunity to perform in intimate settings to a very appreciative audience. Just be prepared to sit in a rush seat chair for an hour or so. The admission prices are generally very small so it is advisable to get your tickets as soon as you can, usually an hour before the performance. Then go have a quick bite or a drink somewhere nearby until the doors open.If you have seen all the major attractions ( you know what they are), make some time to visit some of the smaller museums in the area,i.e., the Delacroix, or the Maillol. They are generally less crowded and offer a more personal atmosphere. The area behind the church of St. Germain-des Pres is lined with art galleries and bistros. Very lively, young, but sophisticated ( read\" post college-age\")crowd. If you are staying in the area, The Latin Quarter ( the 5th arr.) is home to Le Sorbonne and other Music and Art Academies so tends to be a bit noisier. The St. Germain, not so much but depends on your hotel/ apt. location."

St Germain area is compact, cosy area with many cafes and restaurants, however choice of cusine is somewhat limited. Shopping is mainly high end brands but less crowded and more comfortable shopping experience as compared to Champs Elysees. You can find the usual Pauls, Amorina ice-cream just round the corner. The buildings of the area has a long history and the architecture gives an old, historic but romantic feel, just sit at a cafe and people watch. In terms of personal taste, I would say that Le Marais is more right for me, but location wise St Germain is the best place to base in for attractions visiting."

It merges with the lovely Latin Quarter to the east and borders the 7th District to the west. This is a very popular area of the city for visitors to spend time. There are many hotels and restaurants in St. Germain des Pres Quarter. We recently stayed at Le Perle on rue des Canettes and found this to be a hotel worth returning to (see separate review). Several meals taken in this neighbourhood around our hotel. We most enjoyed Comme a Savonnieres on Rue Guisarde (see review). We also enjoyed walking along Boulevard St. Germain, seeing the shops, chocolatiers and historic cafes. We found the macaroons at La Duree on Rue Jacobe to be excellent, noticeably better than what we have in our local La Duree shop in Hong Kong.As for attractions, we enjoyed seeing St. Germain Des Pres Church, which is the oldest church in Paris. Nearby you can also visit historic St. Sulprice Church. Further, from St. Germain you can pretty much find major attractions in all directions, including important museums like Musee National du Moyen Age (formerly Musee de Cluny) and Musee d'Orsay. This is a another reason it can be nice to stay in this area of of the city. In the end, Paris has quite a few nice areas of the city to visit and consider staying during trips to the city. St. Germain is up there with the best of them. Tip: While we enjoy this district in Paris, it can be very busy here with tourists during the high season. As such, during Summer visits to Paris, we have preferred staying in other areas of the city like Le Marais instead."

Stop at a book store, jewelery boutique, upscale clothing establishment, patisserie, or any of the corner cafes. I love the history behind Cafe Flore or Cafe Deuz Magot. If you love cards and writing journals stop just down the block from those two cafes at L'Ecume des Pages, a small but lovely bookstore. My favorite little boutique this time was Fragonard... a perfumerie with lovely french soaps, scented oils and sprays and gifts."

Sure,i like the other bits,as well, but this is the perfect fit for me. St-Germain is the historical center of French intellectialism,as well as, being on the left bank the the answer to the painter's haven of Montmartre. The hallowed names of Satre,Villon,Giacometti,Beckett haunt this precinct,while legions of youthful tourists and students infest the streets and add to the atmospheric charm. Yes,it is loaded with fake-Greek eateries,pseudo -Irish pubs,fake-salsa,pseudo- everything......and a mother-ship of tourist -inspired gift shops. However this zone is not limited to bars,tourists and students. There are fabulous book shops,designer shops,museums,churches,art galleries ,boutique and hotels,as well as,historic cafes and restaurants. Paris offers 10,000 choices. Its impossible not to love this area. As Samuel Johnson said \"if you are bored in St-Germain...then your bored with life\". BOOM BOOM. The center is focused on the church of St-germain which makes getting here via the Metro dead easy. Station is ST.Germain.. The church is the remnant of what was a large monestry complex. Look at the ivy-covered areas inside the wrought iron fence surrounding the building. So,follow me inside. The interior is painted Gothic style, and while we were here in the evenin,,classical music was performed in the candlelite interior.. Facing the square is the cafe Le-Doux magot,the most famous left bank cafe with its sister,cafe de la Flore around the corner, both of whome entertained Picasso,Simon de Beauvoir,Satre and Hemmingway ,who haunted this area. Stare at the arty-=farty types and mobile -obsessed buisness-types with trophy gals or get-ye-inside and order a vin blanc or coffee. Trying to sit outside would succeed, if a scalper sold you a seat . Scarce as hen's teeth because its tres populaire. There is no shortage of beautiful people walking around with strange looking dogs. Stroll rue Bonapart and choose from more cafes and more interesting people. Ecole des Beaux Arts( bose as in the sound system) is further on and this historic School of Arts has churned out a lot of artists we rever today.:Sisley,Renoir. Monet, Fragonard,Delacroix and Gericault are but a few notables that learned their craft here. Everyone looks at the bookstands on rue de Seine,where you can pick up an 'original' photocopy of a postcard or a sketch by Matisse or a Picasso print. The rue de Seine is lined with small eateries,cafes and bistros as you near the Boulevard St. Germain. For more touristy and noisy atmosphere ,head onto rue Buci where art book shops rule and cafes are habitated by good lookers. Where do the uglies hang out?. Turn into rue St.Andre des Arts which has more sandwhich shops ,bars and eateries than you can shake a stick at.. This is where cafe procope,reputed to be the oldest cafe in Ffrance,1686 served Benjemin Franklin,jJefferson,Rousseau,Balzac,Hugo and Voltaire,to name a few. this was their 'hood.  Come into St-Sulpice church,totally blackened with history's grim and soot on the outside and enjoy a twilight organ recital. Its a blast. We stayed at Louis II hotel which is next vto rue de cannettes and the Birdland Jazz Bar,great for night activity and good tucker,with the Village Voice bookshop crammed with English language books and mags. Rue Bonapart offers a great stroll and coffee break in the square. Lots of musicians and performers here. Dont miss Musee Delacroix filled with memorabilia,sketches and drawings,as well as, furniture and famous corresspondence from the painter's life.  You are near odeon metro station,got yer bearings?"

There is Le jardin de Luxemburg right there in St Germain but apart from that it is hard to find a decent park in the area. Taking the pram up and down the steps in the Metro can prove to be a painstaking experience. Unlike many cities in Canada, there are not many indoor places around St Germain to entertain children in the long winter season. sure, La villette is very interesting but is miles away from St Germain. St Germain has changed over the years. Several excellent book shops were gone and unfortunatly have been replaced by fast food shops.

Not much remains of the original church, and its abbey was destroyed during the Revolution. However, there is still a sense of great history as the church was built to house relics of the Holy Cross and the royal tombs of the Merovingian kings. Descartes is also buried here. The church\u2019s architecture is a mix of Romanesque and Gothic, but its most identifiable feature is its large bell tower, which looms high over the famous Deux Magots cafes. The church also shares its name with the street that cuts through the Latin Quarter. You might want to take Boulevard Saint-Germain-des-Pres a few blocks to the Cluny Museum where you can see not only the famous Unicorn tapestries but also some of Saint-Germain-des-Pres Church\u2019s original architecture which has been stored for preservation. Saint-Germain-des-Pres isn\u2019t my favorite church; it\u2019s a quieter, more modest church compared to the sparkly gems of Notre Dame and Saint Chappelle. However, the district adds to the charm of the church, and I highly recommend sitting in the shadows of the church\u2019s famous tower as you sip some coffee at Deux Magots after some serious shopping in the district, known for its high-end and rare-item shops. TIP: The church holds night concerts which bring the building to life in glorious acoustics and mood."

On another street close by (rue de Tournon) is another pretty view up to the Senate building in the Luxembourg Gardens.

If you cross Bd St Michel (boul mich\u2019) the road becomes rue des Ecoles (but you are now in the 5th district or Latin Quarter - reviewed separately)However, if you go west along rue St Sulpice you come to St Sulpice church. Beyond there it becomes Vieux Colombier which goes to rue du Sevres. If you cross that the road becomes rue de Grenelle which takes you into the 7th district (reviewed separately)Sevres Babylone is another good Metro stop from which to explore the 6th district - this time from the other direction. It takes you close to the Bonne Marche shops on rue du Sevres at rue Raspail just past the parc Sevres Babylone. Bonne Marche is two buildings on two blocks and one of the buildings has the largest food floor you can imagine. Christmas 2012, the Bonne Marche has some lovely window displays to rival the displays at Printemps and Galleries Lafayette on Bd Haussmann across the river.note : the Raspail biologique market is nearby (Tues and Fridays 7 am - 2:30 pm) between rue du Cherche-Midi and rue de Rennes. Another market, the St Germain covered market is mostly mall and shops but there is a bit of a food market through a back door. Why you would need anything other than Bonne Marche food floor escapes me though.If you walk from Bonne Marche towards the Seine on rue du Sevre /rue du Four you come more or less to St Germain des Pres church and that famous corner where Brasserie Lipp, Cafe Flore and les Deux Magots are all located.Rue Bonaparte has two good restaurants. Laduree has a shop there (reviewed separately) and a cheap option for lunch, Paul a sandwich shop chain (reviewed separately)I can't get enough of the 6th district. It is never just a one day visit to this area."

Saint-Germain-des-Pres is a long street that spans from the Ile-St-Louis near Notre Dame to the Place de la Concorde. This street shares the name of the district that it cuts through\u2014roughly between the Cluny Museum and Church of Thomas Aquinas. The Saint-Germain district feels a little more urban and modern in energy to me\u2014faster paced with more local Parisians and business men rushing through or crowding at cafes. Having said that, it is also associated with historic artists and thinkers, and has some famous cafes where these intellectuals would meet. One of the most famous of these cafes, Deux Magots, faces the oldest church in Paris\u2014called Saint-Germain-des-Pres, of course! It was founded in the 6th century as an abbey to house a relic of the True Cross. Little of the original structure remains, but the church is still a peaceful spot to recover from the touristy exhaustion of a trip to Paris. The area doesn\u2019t charm me for some reason--maybe because it lacks the sparkle of the other districts. This district is very earthy, very human, very real. I like that, but I guess that I prefer the dazzle of Paris' other districts."

We walked to the Louvre, the Tuileries and the Arc d'Triumphe. The walk, one way, is about 2-2.5 miles. Notre Dame and Sainte Chapelle are less than a 10 minute walk. On top of the proximity to these sights, the best part is that St. Germain has dozens of cafes and restaurants, so you can easily walk for any meal. It is also a very safe area. My only caution to visitors is not to watch for the \"gold ring scam\". This happened to us 3 times in our 7 day visit, though more along the Seine, near the Louvre. I don't know exactly what the goal is (though if you google it there are several opinions), but someone acts as thought they have found a gold ring - looks like a man's wedding band - and tries to give it to you. Do NOT engage in conversation, and completely ignore them. Whether they are looking for money or have an accomplice waiting to try and pick off your wallet, beware. Nothing happened to us since we suspected a scam the first time, ignored them and walked away. It was almost comical when the exact same thing happened two additional times!"

Everyone kept telling me it was all about food and shopping. My first night with friends I walked around at night and ate at a small sandwich shop. This place is great- it has everything and is a great place to go see & meet Parisians (and other tourists). The Cafe's are all close to each other, there is an ice cream and frozen yogurt shop that are great, there is plenty of entertainment to see too. The Latin Quarter is very close to it, too. I went again in the afternoon and the area was very cool. Theres a lot of cute stores to go do some shopping."

Besides that particular incident, this area is great for shopping and taking in the very Parisian way of living."

St Germain des Pres is at the origin of the true heart of Paris and the french people and hopefully will be able to remain so.

In my travels, I have found that the best places to visit are those off the 'E\" ticket route so to speak. In other words, away from the flocks of tourist. There is so much wonderful history to experience"

It is a good change from the busy and fairly crowded Marais. The cafes are slightly more spaced out and the service amazingly efficient and professional, despite the influx of millions of tourists who don't speak French. The trick is to speak 'bonjour' on arrival at a restaurant or cafe and hen wait for the server to come back ith a menu. Then you wait for him to come back to take your order. Please be patient and do make up your mind within about 5 minutes because when he returns he expects you to be ready. Remember, he is serving quite a few tables and can't hang around for you to make up your mind with him at your table. If you relax and respect their system you will love your meal in Paris much more. St Germain has a lovely church, near the few famous cafes like Les Deux Magots, Flore and Lipp. The shops are incredible mainly dotted along Blvd St Germain. Do go to the side streets like Dragon where you will find unique boutiques selling specialty pieces you won't find anywhere else in the world. I still love Le Marais, particularly on Sunday when most shops on the Left Bank are closed."

I really enjoy the ambiance with all the cafes, galleries, the people, etc. There's something about the mood there that I find welcoming and that I seem to connect with. The atmosphere is lively especially at night and there always seem to be something interesting going on in this district. Thumbs up for Saint Germain des Pres!"

When i go to paris i roam. i am not a foodie so am not helpful there and i do not dine at places simply because of their name.I often walk between 10-12 hours a day and am never bored. as i am often alone i feel totally safe and can run out at any hour should i need something.There are lovely small hotels that (this is a joke anywhere in the world, now) that are affordable, clean and the staff are friendly and extremely helpful. the hotel i stay at (i am not telling!!!) lets me bring my own coffee (fairway, nyc) and allows me to keep cheese, fruit, etc. in their refrigerator.If you walk into any establishment and are polite - Bonjour! is a good start.As i am alone a vast percentage of the times i visit paris i frequently get restaurants that want to seat me behind an open door or next to the swinging kitchen door - i was born with an ability to say NON! and i am seated like a Poodle (they prefer their dogs to people) a the Bon Chic Bon Chiens always always come first. I met an american couple who told me they loved their dog - whom was seated at a chair at their table - more than their children.To stay in this area you have two choices - to act like a rude tourist or simply relax and blend in.I love it, otherwise, why would i go there so often?"

A very historic area with the church of the former Abbey Saint-Germain des Pres and the association with Jean Paul Sartre and the existentialists is certainly worth visiting and spending a few minutes taking in. More popular now because of the nearby shopping and the famous cafes on the corner which are apparently a much-coveted hot-spot for people watching. The local Parisians I encountered on my trip advised to not bother eating in the area and to pass it by for a more enjoyable cafe experience somewhere else. Which is what I did, and I have no regrets about not spending time at the cafes here."

The area is anchored by three of Paris' most famous eateries, all withing eyesight of each other: Les Deux Magots, Cafe de Flore, and Brasserie Lipp directly across the street. We had a wonderful meal at Les Deux Magots and spent a lot of time just watching the busy sidewalk and street in front of us.Saint-Germain-des-Pres is a lovely part of Paris with beautiful architecture and great people watching. It's also just a short walk from Saint Sulpice, Luxembourgh Gardens, and more. My only problem with our visit is that we didn't have enough time there. But it's a must-visit when we return."

There are several churches claiming to be the oldest, but Saint German des Pres is not only built on the site of an abbey from about 550 A.D., it apparently still maintains one or two walls from that abbey. It is a place where you are likely to find evening musical performance that illustrate the amazing acoustics. Its windows are lovely and the soaring Gothic architecture (and the quiet, compared to Notre Dame) is impressive. Part of Descartes is buried there (look for his memorial in the St. Benoit chapel) and the other side chapels also contain much of interest.It is right across the street from the famous Deux Magots. Its flying buttresses can be admired from the pleasant little adjoining park (and shopping nearby is pretty great too). The complexity of the architecture is best viewed both from within and from without. A piece of 13th century sculpture (unfinished) is displayed in one of the side chapels as well (it was found while excavating for a car park). If you're into things Medieval or Gothic, this is a great visit."

After several visits to Paris and much exploration of many - not all - parts of the city, I have come to the conclusion Saint Germaine-des-Pres is where I would live if I were lucky enough to live in Paris. It's stylish, intellectual, artsy and yet, like other parts of Paris, it offers the feel of a village, not a huge city. I think it was Colette who described Paris as a collection of villages. That is how one should think of it, and set out to explore one village or neighborhood at a time. In Saint Germain-des-Pres, you will find history, cobblestones, galleries, shops, legendary cafes and charm. It's a bit more upscale than the adjacent Latin Quarter (also a wonderful neighborhood), but not as commercial-feeling as the Right Bank. The pace is a bit slower than the Latin Quarter, in my opinion, and the feel is a bit less touristy."

We enjoyed the location, restaurants, being close to 2 metro stops that got us all over the city. There is such a vibrancy & so much history to this neighborhood. I would definitely stay in St.Germain des Pres whenever I visit Paris. Nothing is far in any European city if you can figure out the transportation system & Paris has one of the best."

You can't dismiss places because they attract tourists, not if the quality of the local shops and restaurants etc are good. It's full of cafes, restaurants, quaint little shops, bookshops, bakeries, silver shops, little hotels, flower stalls. It's a great place to base yourself from because it really is very central. Look up places to eat at on trip advisor and hotels to stay at, read the reviews and you'll soon know if you want tot try it. I walked through this neighborhood on my own day and nit and always felt safe. The area has alot of history and poets, writers, muscians from centuries gone by used to hang out here, live here, write here.....it's full of wonder in so many ways."

Usually a great morning in Paris (6e) starts with a baguette fresh off the boulangerie oven then heading back to your apartment to enjoy it with your breakfast coffee... unless you are nearby the Croissanterie on Saint Germain des Pres.No more baguette needed; just go there with a friend and enjoy the lumping of breakfast, with a fabulous expresso and people watching..I could not figure out exactly what makes their expresso so authentic, it has the right aroma and kick that you need in the morning. I tried the cafe expresso at the cafe des Deux Magots but although it is smack on the place St Germain des Pres but the strength and kick of the Croissanterie expressso was nowhere to be found. True the waiters at the Deux Magots are impeccably dressed. You do feel like you must wait on them instead of them on you.. The Croissanterie is more relaxed; so I went back there the next day and ordered my expresso and croissant and it just felt like breakfast heaven again.. I told the manager there that his coffee was better than the Deux Magots'.He blushed because comparing an institution such as the Deux Magots to the Croissanterie is a blasphemy by itself and telling the Croissanterie manager that he served a better expresso is just Parisian heaven to his ears.."

Saint-Germain-des-Pres have bookshops for the everyone. Must amusing. We went to Eyrolles and bought cookbooks for French macarons - and catbooks. You have to notice this - they have dogs in Paris - but the cat IS Paris.Eyrolles is in Boulevard St-Germain - but there is a bookstore on every corner. Almost for everyone - fantasy, history, English literature, poems, science - everything."

It was about dinner time and let me tell you, this is where you want to be if you're hungry. For the most part, there is no shortage of restaurants and cafes in Paris, but there is an intense concentration of them in the St Germain area. And because outdoor seating is the norm for most places, it's very lively here throughout the evening. We picked a restaurant, had a great, relaxing meal, then continued our walk. There is a lot to see and do in this amiable neighborhood besides eat, so I would put this on your list for a way to spend a nice afternoon or evening."

It was a really nice buzzing area in which to stroll on a summers evening before our meal.We liked it so much that we explored further later on in our trip, taking in the main street with the very expensive shops, we sat outside at one of the numerous cafes watching the world go by. It appeared at times as though we had stumbled on a model assignment as most of the women and some men paraded around as though on a catwalk.If we were to return to Paris, this would be the district I would look to stay in."

St-Germain is the center for intellectual book stores which attracted the likes of T.S. Eliot, Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway.I highly recommend walking on rue Bonaparte you will eventually see the Ecole des Beaux Arts on your left. This is the historic School of Fine Arts in Paris through which many of the great names in art history passed before anyone knew them.Lots of bistros, coffee shops and charming boutique also make up a big part of this vibrant neighborhood."

I'll be staying in the Saint-Germain district. The first time I came to Paris with my mother, and found the area near the Eiffel Tower to be swamped with illegal and very aggressive panhandlers and street sellers, especially at night. Their aggressiveness made us uncomfortable walking alone in the evening. Instead, we took the Metro (right next to our hotel) to the St. Germain or Latin Quartier districts. The food, culture, sights, and people-watching can not be beat in these areas, and we felt safe walking alone. There are several bistros and cafes on each block, each with food more amazing than the last. It's also central to everything. I highly recommend spending free time in this area - you won't regret it!"

It is wonderful to wander the area to take in the sights and sounds. The Church of St Germaine des Pres survived the Revolution in 1789 and is the oldest church in Paris. Home to three famous brasseries (Cafe de Flore, Les Deux Magots and the Brasserie Lipp) and epicenter for 19th Century writers, artists and philosophers, this area of Paris deserves several hours, if not days, to fully appreciate all it has to offer."

The church here is simple yet beautiful- not grand stone like it's cousin Notre Dame down the road, but wooden & colourful & you can imagine how it would have been 5 centuries ago... It's accessible. The area surrounding it is a splendour for bars & brasseries (think 1920's Paris writers scene) and the shopping (especially clothes) is fab too... We love this area so much that we bought a holiday apartment in it!!! Read the novel \"Lady & The Unicorn\" by Chevalier before visiting the Musee de Moyen Age & Eglise de St Germain-des-Pres."

We also visited Notre Dame and St. Sulpice, so we know what the big ones look like. It is nice to see a different kind of history, and St Germain has plenty of it. Swing by, check it out, a drop a few Euro in the box to say thanks!"

It is in a nice area of high end shopping and cool boutiques. It looked nice in the distance as we approached it but once we walked up to it, we were less then impressed. It had buskers outside, people begging on the doorstep and once inside, it was dark and dingy. I know the history of the church is great so if you are into history, go for it. But as a walking visit with the family in tow, I wouldn't recommend you go out of your way."

It is a great place to stop at a cafe and people watch. This active area is very close to the beautiful Luxembourg gardens. A favorite activity of mine is to grab a lunch from a bakery in St. Germain and walk up to the gardens and take it all in. It's a wonderful way to spend an afternoon. The Amorino gelato stands in this area are also a must try!"
