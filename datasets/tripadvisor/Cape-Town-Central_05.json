Its totally safe the views are well worth it when you get to the top for a 360 view of cape town."

But it was worth it - the views are great along the way, and at the top, you are rewarded with a 360-degree panorama of Cape Town.I do recommend wearing proper hiking shoes, as there is some climbing and rocks can be slippery - I was wearing running shoes and did not feel really comfortable & secure."

You don\u2019t need to bring large backpack since you will kick it away when you try to climb the very steep rocks. All I got were just a bottle of water and a camera, as well as my phone. I could see some hikers brought their own picnic and had a meal up there. The view along the way is also awesome. I could see the whole Table Mountain together with the beach (Camps Bay) and the V&A waterfront at the same time. The first day I wore jeans and I ripped the knee part while climbing. So, in the second time I wore shorts. "

However it is very steep and there are chains and footholds needed to help you up the hike at certain points. While it was not physically exhausting for 2 fit people, it was dangerous - i.e. Sections of the hike where if you slipped or lost your footing, you could die! So wear good hiking shoes and NOT worn out sneakers like I did. The view at the top was rewarding with 360 views of Cape Town. It took us about 2 hours to hike up, with quite a few breaks, and about a half hour to get down."

It's a great way to start the day and the view when you finally get to the top and look out over Cape Town is truly spectacular. You'll need suntan lotion in summer because it's quite hot, unfortunately in CT it's windy and the weather changes quickly so maybe a zip up or carry a light top with you. Also, one of the routes has a little bit of climbing and you'll need some strength to pull yourself up. If you can't do that make sure you take the other route. Some of the best profile pics you'll ever have will be when you're standing on top of Lions head!"

As a person with a fear of heights, this was not an easy endeavor. Climbing up was manageable, but coming down, looking into the vast fall below was nearly impossible for me. Thankfully, I met kind hikers who helped and coached me through some of the most challenging parts such as climbing down ladders and metal bars. I highly recommend the hike for those without a fear of heights. The views going up and at the top are incredible. Cape Town is such a natural beauty."

The first time I tried to climb this was mid-year during the rainy season with lots of strong wind. I had to give up as I got to the path/rock interface which was really slippery and scary at that time. This time around, I had decided to go during the drier months and with the sun\u2019s blessing and just a faint gust. It took me a total of 2hours and 45 minutes to get to the top and come back down to the parking lot. What was really nice was the camaraderie you form when travelling with other hikers who are also trying to get to the top, walking the steep path and then scaling the rock face with the metal handles and chains. Along the way, you are greeted by magnificent views of Cape Town and Camps Bay. And at the top, the sight is just breathtaking.Definitely a must but you have to be well prepared for it. If unsure, better do the hike with somebody who knows the area well. And for those who may be physically challenged, there is no shame in going half way."

You'll want to take pictures along the way but trust me, the view at the top is the one you're really looking for. I was a bit worried about the hike from the reviews but it wasn't too bad. We are in average physical shape and the hike took an hour each way. I would suggest not to rush as there is some climbing of rocks and ladders involved and it is just best to take your time to avoid injury. Because of the climbing it was a bit cumbersome to have a bag with me so try not to pack too much or have bulky items with you. As long as you are in average/good physical shape, highly recommend this hike!"

Oh, it's completely beautiful on the way up, but the closer you get to the summit, the more difficult and steep it becomes. By the time I reached the top I was so out of breath I thought I was going to faint! Regardless, the view was definitely the reward. I plan on going back to Lion's Head and do this climb at least two more times....But I'm going to prep at home first by doing some local hikes! If this is your first time hiking, then I suggest you go slow and don't try to keep up with anyone else. Using a guide is a good idea but not entirely necessary as there are many people on the trail at various times of the day. But most importantly, enjoy the view on your way up!"

Pick some snacks and enjoy a lovely picnic at the top, since there is plenty of seating space. There are not many trees (Western Cape vegetation is mostly fynbos), so sunblock is essential. Kids from the age of 6 (with parental assistance) will be comfortable with this hike, but I wouldn't recommend it to the elderly.

I climb lions head as often as I can, the view never gets boring , and with so many different parts and ways to climb it you can try a different route every time if you want.Although most people go up the traditional way, the first part being the worst as the gradient of the sandy slope is a bit steep, after that you pretty much walk up steps and rocks spiraling in a round a bout fashion until you reach the top.I recommend first timers don't go on the chains and ladders and rather opt for the slightly more tame route around, so ask people for some direction if you are not sure.also always wear hiking shoes or sneakers and comfortable exercise gear, DON'T do this hike in jeans and sandals, its a hike not a walk.You should be able to make it up to the top in about 40 minutes if you are relatively fit , and you will want to take water with you in a light backpack as there are no water points.its also advisable to go in a group of people and not alone, especially if you are a first time climber, also try go early morning in summer as it gets hot, and busy. winter although not as hot is busy on a good weather day as its a favorite activity for locals to climb this amazing mountain."

We started around 7:30pm, and were told that the hike would be a short 45 minutes up. The path was more challenging than we expected, and it took us around an hour and half to get up the mountain. To get to the top, it is a bit more of a rock scramble. Pay attention to the path up--it is hard to see in the night & we got lost once! Other than the path being a bit more rugged than we expected, Lion's Head is an absolutely ideal hiking destination in Cape Town! The views are incredible all the way up (we stopped multiple times for pictures). On top, there is plenty of flat space to snack, rest, and take in the view.

It took us about 2 hours to do the entire thing, and it was a little difficult, but easily manageable to anyone who is physically able to hike long distances, climb rocks, and lift their body weight for some portions of the climb. I would not recommend it to anyone with bad knees or who is afraid of heights. Although the climb was a bit challenging towards the top, the view was incredible and it was a lot of fun climbing it. You can still see amazing views halfway up the walking path (small incline, well-maintained, about 20 minutes up the mountain) if you are not an adventurous climber or if you are traveling with children. You have breathtaking views of Table Mountain the whole way up. We had our hotel taxi drop us off at the entrance, then we called him to pick us up when we were done. Give yourself enough time to climb down before sundown, and I wouldn't recommend attempting this in wet conditions. We did not need a map or a tour guide to navigate the trail, it is well maintained and easy to navigate. Overall, an amazing experience and the highlight of our trip!"

First part untill the paragliding point is easy to walk but with a steep slope, after that, the path changes in boulders that function like stepping stones untill the top. It is not recommended to walk here in the rain since stones can become wet and slippery. No fences are even at some steep points which may be dangerous.The view is wonderful of cape town, you walk in a 360 degree circle around lions head which allows you to see the entire city."

The steeper sections have nice chains to hold on to and remember to keep to the RIGHT hand path going up and the LEFT hand path going down. Once you get to the top and have your breathing under control, be prepared to lose your breath again as you take in the best views of Table mountain, Devils peak, Cape-town, 12 Apostles, Robben Island and Clifton that will get anywhere in the Cape."

Some ladders at the top but nothing too difficult. Flip flops not recommended. I took it at a run - 45 mins up, 30 down, but a more leisurely approach could comfortably double those times."

Whether you are on your own, with a friend, a group of friends or your dog, you simply must do this hike, either at Sunrise or Sunset (or both). Do'able for even the most ardent couch-surfer, you will be handsomely rewarded for very little effort as the trail, like the people you will meet, is friendly, luring you to the top with a visual display every step of the way. It is safe at most times, as there is a constant stream of locals and tourists alike, from 05h30 - 12h00pm (midnight). Always pack a warm top, water (or wine) and a sense of humour as the weather in Cape Town is notoriously fickel and you dont want to have to hurry this one. Go up early and watch the sun rise over the distant Helderberg Mountains, whilst simultaneously watching the moon descend into the sea and rise in Rio. The muted traffic tones drifiting upwards, reminds you, you are in the middle of one of the most beautiful cities in the world. Depending on your fitness, allow anything from 25 minutes to 1 hour to get to the top, and there are many places to sit and absorb the visual feast along the way. Pack some food and fine Cape wine and savour the views and social atmosphere at the top. You will be back!"

Well one reason to avoid lion's head is because it is dangerous (no guard rails, no water, there can be lots of people). Lion's head is hard (a long uphill walk to get to the steep rocks and the lots of scrambling for uphill traction). Lion's head requires muscles (going up the chains..... Nuff said). Having said all this -- the lion's head is a glorious adventure. The views all the way up are terrific, the feeling of accomplishment when you get to the summit is worth the effort. I was 63 yrs when I climbed it the first time and I have been back several times since. I strongly recommend the climb - but don't expect it to be easy. Bring water, good hiking shoes and sunscreen."

Living in one of the most beautiful cities in the world,one has so much choice of spectacular outdoor activities which many locals take for granted but as a visitor to Cape Town ,a hike up Lions head is a MUST.For the relatively fit, it should take anything from 45 - 75 minutes but don't be fooled ,it's not as easy a hike as it seems.Gravel is loose,and the steps are uneven so be sure to wear sturdy shoes. Preferably proper hiking boots or decent trainers ,not like some fools who go up in flip flops!You can get to the top faster by using the chains (which I prefer) or if the idea makes you a little nervous then there is a slightly longer,less steep, route around.Views throughout the hike are spectacular and you get a 360degree view of the city!The full moon hike is extremely popular, as well as very busy!!Even better is to go up earlier,have a picnic at the top ,watch the sunset from the one side and then the full moon rise from the other...it's the most breathtaking sight!!But coming down can be tricky with it being so busy,make sure you have a flash or headlight and take it slow.Whether morning,afternoon or evening, always make sure you have enough water to keep hydrated.Another thing you don't want to forget is your camera but better to leave other valuables at home!!One word of advice ...be careful and ideally ,don't go up alone."

Its only the last section that turns into more of a direct up route, with a bit a scramble up the rocks and up a few ladders at one point.

There's a point where you can take a shorter route by using ladders and hooks on the rocks to get up but I didn't want to overdo it for myself so I chose to do the steep climb and make wide steps upwards over rocks. My lungs were burning by the time I made it up but I settled down for 30 minutes to observe and get great pictures. The way down is obviously easier but I'm glad I pushed my lazy butt to do it.

There was a section that involved the use of chains and ladders to ascend since it was very steep (see pic with warning sign posted). There was also a longer way around which I believe was more moderate.Once the summit is reached, you have a wonderful panorama of Cape Town, including Table Mountain, The Twelve Apostles, Robben Island, Camps Bay, and others.We saw a lot of people hiking up to catch the sunset. I recommend wearing sturdy footwear and bringing headlamps if you plan to do that."

Starts off as a hike that just about anyone can do but soon you get to a narrow walk way along the edge of the mountain, not much more difficult but if you are afraid of heights this may scare you...then the worst comes (if you have a fear of heights)...you really have to start using your arms and legs and actually climbing. There are even parts where you will have to climb ladders and use chains a bit. Not your average walk in the park. The views from the top are stunning! And the challenge was well worth it. BUT if you have a terrible fear of heights don't do this...and if you are totally out of shape or have injuries that keep you from climbing (using both arms and legs) don't do it. The scariest part for me was getting down and the whole way up I was dreading the climb down. In the end I was glad I braved it out and made it to the top and back down in one piece. Give yourself 2 hours total."

The beginning for some reason gets you out of breath so don't give up- It gets better as your body gets used to it and it is definitely WORTH the effort! If you're not too comfortable with heights, the scrambles towards the top may be a little unpleasant but I always love to encourage people to get out of their comfort zone. There were several young kids on the hike and they did just fine! It also gets VERY HOT after sunrise so make sure you take PLENTY of water and keep yourself hydrated. Despite all this, it was an extremely FUN HIKE! I really LOVED the scramble at the top and the small bits of rock climbing they had. It wasn't very difficult at all and added that extra bit of adventure to the hike! The views at the top were amazing and it was nice to just sit on the edge and ponder the beauty. We had amazing weather for photos (though not so good for sunburns!)- clear blue skies and endless visibility! The route is obvious- just keep climbing upwards, so you don't really need a guide. If we had done a sunrise or sunset, I might have used one just for the safety though. It would be a little scary for me to have done that in the dark! There is a diversion (several routes) to the 'cave' just near the first ladder at the top. There were plenty of Capetowners that helped us along the route and we made it to the caves safely. That was also definitely worth the extra walk.If you like the outdoors, a bit of sweat and fun, don't miss out on Lionshead! Then head over to the main street on Camps Bay and indulge in a gelato!Best of all, it's TOTALLY FREE TO DO!!Ps It may get a little slippery on a rainy day and the views may be clouded over, so choose wisely!"

I had to use my cell phone light just to see directly in front of me quite a few times. It was a large group near us.

The first half is just walk up and then it becomes quite narrow and rocky and you have to pay attention to your footing, even on the \"easy\" route as you're walking on the edge with no protection. It didn't help that we chose to go for full moon so it was pretty crowded up there and some areas cant fit two people going in each direction so it bottle necked quite a bit which made it a bit stressful at times. I would recommend to go in the morning so you can take your time and check the wind levels that day.

The line up for the cable car can be between 2 to 4 hours depending the day and the time of day. A bit expensive but worth it if you have the time and patience to wait in 90 F heat. The view is spectacular."

It was not as gruelling a hike as I expected (definitely need to be moderately fit though!) and watching the sunset at the end was amazing. Quick safety recommendation: If you're interested in doing this in the evening, by all means do so, just time it so that you begin your descent immediately after sunset. We were surrounded by people on the way up and down, but I wouldn't recommend going up later than we did, as you'll probably have a very isolated descent."

Don't worry about losing your way - paths are very obvious. This hike has a couple ladders and climbing handles near the top. Skip this activity if you are at all afraid of heights. Will require a fair amount of physical exercise. Hiking boots preferred but tennis shoes will work as well. Allow 1.5 hours round trip for the super speedy and 3 hours for the less active. Option to walk all the way around the mountain on a wide path, then up to the ladders and steeper rocks. OR Walk about 150 meters from the trail head and turn right onto a narrow trail. The path to the right is the path less traveled, consisting of small stairs and city views. You will eventually come to a sheer rock wall with a chain dangling down between gaps in the rock (3 meters of climbing - obvious places to put your feet - somewhat hidden, so keep your eyes pealed!). Additional option to continue to the right and walk the path around to skip the chain climb."

You start from the road on Signal hill and commence on a jeep track that then becomes an easy path. There are fantastic views first of the back of the 'Lion' ie Signal Hill and then Camps Bay, Bantry Bay, Seapoint, Greenpoint and finally the City Centre and glorious views of Table Mountain. It's a good walk to do if Table Mountain is closed but please check before you start that Lions Head is not covered in cloud too and if there is cloud pouring over Table Mountain ( ie the 'table cloth' is over) then please note it is likely to be windy on Lions Head too and be prepared. The walk can be done up to a point as an easy slight incline walk and stop at the point where there are ladders and chains. It will take you about 45 mins to reach this point at an easy pace. You will still get sensational views without going all the way to the top. But for the more adventurous then the best and safest route to the top is to use the metal fixed ladders which will take you to the very top. Note this is a very popular walk and can be very crowded with walkers "

The price you pay for the views across the city is an hour's toil up a rocky path, with two ladders and a bit of scrambling over ledges.In an age of mass obesity, it was heartwarming to see literally hundreds of people on the trail on a Saturday afternoon. If you're not up for the full challenge of reaching the summit, there's the option to walk round the foot of the peak, but the route is not waymarked.Start off on the wide main path up from the parking area on Signal Hill Road. After 20 minutes you reach a paragliding launch site. Continue for another five minutes past a rocky overhang above you on the right, with bubbly rocks.Then, look out for a path branching half left downhill. This is the orbital path which contours round the hill avoiding the summit, eventually taking you back to the road."

There are very 'alien' locals who run up and down Lions Head for fun - they are to be avoided, mostly because they are travelling at a rate of knots and they are very, very fit. This is a climb for determined, water carrying bet breakers.We had been challenged by a friend who had climbed LH in the winter that if we could climb Lions Head, the wine would be paid for at a very good restaurant in Camps Bay. Anyone who know SA will understand that it is not the price of the bet (wine is relatively inexpensive for Brits by comparison) it is the bet itself\u2026In 30\u00ba - 35\u00ba heat this is a climb and a half for two people who are reasonably fit - but to be passed by young people constantly up and down the mountain was ignominious.We made it, and were very happy to have made it not simply to win the bet. As we made our way down the mountain there were crowds of young people making their way to the top to see the setting sun on their last day of the Christmas holidays before going back to college out University. It was great to see them, they were not huddled round screens in darkened rooms, they were going to experience a great view from a great place. Though it must have got pretty crowded up there that evening!"

I had thought that I'd skip this after going up Table Mountain the day before, but I was glad that I decided to make the trip to Lion's Head.The walk/climb up to the top is not for the faint of heart, as it requires you to climb up some quite steep ladders and steps. i absolutely loved it and was in my element along with many many others, but I did notice that some people struggled with the climb and turned back. You should be of a medium fitness level to attempt this.A totally different view of Table Mountain and highly recommended."

An absolute must, even if you are a local Capetonian...but for foreigners as well, if you want to see a breath taking view from the top of a mountain...Getting up Lion's Head can be done taking a lovely stroll, keeping in mind that is is a rather steep way up and going up a little higher will reduce the path's width, so always practice caution when taking up this mountain.I would suggest a nice walk / Hike for first timers and on the second trip, you will know the mountain a little better, as some people actually jog or run up or down but, I will not recommend doing this if you do not know the path.Once up there, the view is so spectacular and you have a 360 degree view of most of Cape Town and the beaches, including Table Mountain.Enjoy and practice caution...and you will have an unforgettable experience."

You always feel a sense of accomplishment having reached the top.I recently went up with my 7yr old who did the chain section which was amazing.I have done it when it's been damp and/or previously raining and there is allot more traction on the rocks.

I agree with other comments - go early to avoid heat and crowds - bring water and carry it in small backpack and wear appropriate shoes that have good grip. Fairly straightforward hike - with more difficulty and steepness at the top. Close to the end of the hike there is a choice of routes - using the chains and ladders or taking the less steep route. We went up the chains/ladders, which was more conjested as you need to take turns allowing hikers up/down and came down the longer route. We are glad we did both. The longer route had an extra landing with great and different views that we were able to appreciate. The entire hike took us about 2 hours to do - Definitely recommend this one! Only reason I am not giving this a 5 is that we went when it was a bit crowded and needed to wait a few times during the hike to get through congestion spots."

The whole route is a dirt road with an easy start but an acute increase in difficulty as you get closer to the top. There's a fair bit of climbing and narrow ledges so you need a certain amount of fitness to get up there. The first plateau took about an hour and then another 15 mins or so to climb the final steep bit to the top. This is quite a steep climb. The views all the way up are magnificent and well worth the climb. The first plateau is fine if you don't want to go all the way to the top as the views here are breathtaking and there's plenty of room to rest and take photos. Bring plenty of water, start early, wear a hat and sunscreen and wear comfortable walking shoes. There's no signs at all along the route so you really don't know what point of the climb you've reached and when the difficulty starts.

The climb is a satisfying challenge .. In parts it's tough and toward the end steep. Two additional tips would have made the climb more enjoyable 7) have a light backpack so you can free up your arms to climb the steeper parts and 8) there are two ways to reach the final stage - steep via chains and grips, another slightly longer route that is easier to traverse .. Not knowing these two made the ascent more daunting as I was worried about getting back down.. The views from the top are amazing .. I read another review saying they aren't work it but I suspect that reviewer runs a helicopter company ... This is a great experience .. We saw a great variety of climbers from younger ultra fit through to families and even folk who were more mature .. It's doable of you take time and heed the recommendations ...

Use shoes with a tough/rubber grip to avoid slipping and yeah, don't give up on the way and turn back (lots of people turned back). #MindOverMatter :-)"

A couple days after hiking Table Mountain (which was fantastic) I climbed Lion's Head late on an early, sunny February afternoon with three colleagues. It's a hike and then at some point becomes a bit of skirting around the side of the rocks using some chain link hand holds bloted into the rock. Then a bit of rock climbing via some steel handholds bolted into the rocks over a short section. Then a steep climb pretty quickly to the summit. It's not as difficult as it sounds. Give yourself a couple hours to get up to the top. The views from the top of the city, the coast below (Camps Bay, Bantry Bay and Clifton) and of Table Mountain are memorable (see attached photos). Make a point of doing this if you're inclined. You'll be rewarded with the best views of the peninsula and Cape Town."

You will have to do a tiny bit of rock-climbing, but for the most part the track is fairly standard, just steep! If you're driving, park at the bottom and make sure your valuables are well out of sight. It's also a good idea to tip the local car guard before embarking on your climb. Lion's Head is very popular when the moon is full - a beautiful sight, but do be aware it will be crowded with picnickers at the top."

To really see how the entire mountain shows the Lions Head, the Rump and the tail one really needs to take a helicopter ride. I can imagine, it would be a great hiking trail for the enthusiasts but it was not for me."

What starts off as a hike quickly becomes a climb, and it was lovely. The view is fantastic, and it's 360. Getting up there, sitting on the rocks and contemplating -dominating- Cape Town is a strong feeling. Because you're not as high as on the Table, you see everything much clearer. I would recommend being comfortable with heights, as well as secure shoes (ideally with a grip or something, because my trainers kept slipping on the sand covered boulders). You don't need a lot of experience as long as you take your time, and are with someone who is used to this sort of thing. To be honest, I really became a hiker over this holiday, and was use really careful regarding my footing. (I had a camera in one hand to give you an idea..but for going back down you need two hands). Hope you enjoy it, my only regret is the sun was covered by clouds so we didn't see the sunset\u2026the climb up as great though :)"

The best time to climb is just before sunset, so that you can watch the sun set over the ocean when your at the top. When it's full moon, you don't need a torch to go down, because the moon's light is enough. But if it's not full moon, don't forget to bring your torch!Also, be careful in the dark. There has been an increase in crime on Lion's Head, so make sure you climb with a big group of people.Definitely a must do when in Cape Town! And it's free!"

Among the many attractions in Cape Town, I rate this hike to Lion's head as the best of all.We parked at Signal Hill Road, exact location -33.936843, 18.394916. Make sure you bring enough water before you ascend. There is a drink stall where the parking is. 2-3 hours is sufficient for this hike.The beauty of this hike is that you see 360 degrees view of Cape Town, because as you hike up, you need to circle the Lion's head and each ascend, the view becomes better and it is amazing. You will come to a point where there is a recommended route , or a route which is at your own risk ( with staples, chains, ladder). We chose the risky route, which is manageable, just be careful and do not rush if you have young children. I would not recommend this route if the child is young than 12years old. There are groups of students doing the hike too, especially in the evening when it is not so hot. Security is not a question. This place is beautiful, lovely, and amazing.

There is a branch of the Lion's Head path that starts at the top of Upper Rhine Road (at the base of Signal Hill), goes gradually up in a southwesterly direction skirting Signal Hill, passes an area where there appears to be a little mosque, and then continues southwest below Lion's Head, before connecting with the main circular path around Lion's Head. It's about two hours to the top from this starting point, 90 minutes back down, so bring lots of water (1.5 liters per person or more). Great views off to the west, and there is a stand of boulders about 10 minutes below the connection point with the main path where you can a rest or a picnic without anyone around.Once rejoining the main path, as you get closer to the top there are some ladders and hand stapels before getting to the split (located at one of the last and few trees on Lion's Head) where you can go the chain route or the \"easy\" route. If you are in good health, have decent shoes, and are comfortable with heights, the chain route is fine going up ... but I took the easier route that bypasses the chains to go down. People say it's much quicker on the chains but I don't think there's a big difference, especially coming down. I'll mention again the need for lots of water, because I saw a lot of people who only brought a single small bottle. There is little shade and no taps anywhere on the route, so you really need to bring your own and bring a lot because it's hot and moderately strenuous. Take a hat and lots of sunscreen too, and a little food to enjoy somewhere along the way. Have fun! Also, if it has rained recently or is scheduled to rain I would not recommend this ... the rocks are smooth and probably quite slippery when wet."

Most of it is flat up hill until you reach the top portion. Then you're walking among rocks and climbing a little. There is a section were you need to use chains to get up to the next level, I avoided this. There's an alternative route you can take, which is a bit longer but I felt safer. I wish I wouldn't have waited until the last night to take this hike, so that I could've done it more than once. Maybe even try to get up using the chains. This could quite possibly be some of the most breathtaking views I've ever seen."

While the physical effort isn't particularly high, the paths are narrow with sharp drop offs. There are ladders and chains to help climb up some of the rock face as well, and I hear at the top there is a very narrow walkway across to get to the plateau. Even having gone half way the view is incredible, and seeing both sides of the town with the water was a real treat.

The views are breathtaking and provided you're not afraid of heights you will enjoy being at the summit. However, we were expecting a much easier walk based on what we had read in various brochures, so I would caution inexperienced hikers/climbers to expect a decent challenge and a degree of risk. The climb is generally okay: it starts on wide paths that are safe and not steep; the final ascent is tricker - essentially climbing up rocks, using ladders and chains at times, with a very steep drop almost always not far away. It concerns me to see websites talking about taking very young children on the \"easier route\" - I wouldn't consider this hike suitable for children or anyone with a fear of heights. My girlfriend loved it though and we did get stunning views/photos of the sunset and we managed to pass the trickier section of the descent before darkness properly kicked in. That said, I didn't always feel safe with strong winds blowing at the high and narrow sections so I didn't really enjoy the climb itself and I'm glad I didn't have to do it in complete darkness!"

A local told us that the winds and clouds on table mountain are usually not present on Lion's Head so we drove the short distance there and started the hike. The path winds around Lion's Head and gives you stunning views of Campo's Bay, Table Mountain and Cape Town. The road eventually gave way to a path, which eventually led to a fork where you could either continue on the path or take a more direct, albeit more challenging route with ladders and chains. We took the more demanding route and it was fine, but if people have a fear of heights, it could play tricks on you and the straight path may be a better alternative. The last stretch of the climb will be more physically exerting, but the summit is easily reachable by anyone in reasonable shape. The summit offers a panorama of Cape Town and the local was right...the winds that swirled on Table Mountain in the distance were never a threat to us on Lion's Head. This was a very enjoyable hike that was well worth it."

First of all I would warn that anyone who has read in a guide that this is an 'easy' climb may want to take it with a pinch of salt depending on your experience and feelings about heights. The start of the walk is a fairly gentle incline but the scrambling sections are tough on the thighs, particularly on the way down, and possibly a bit scary.HOWEVER it is totally worth it and probably my favourite hike that I've ever done. Amazing views from the top, rivalling table mountain and possibly even better since you get table mountain in the view! The staples and chains and ladders make for a memorable challenge and are really fun (if you like that kind of thing!). Achey muscles made walking downstairs a challenge for the next couple of days - it's the descent that really gets you - but would do it again any day.Important to note- the path does split off near the top so you have an option between a stapled scramble and a walk, however if you want to get to the very summit then the more challenging climbing is unavoidable as the entire last section is made up of this.If you go on a hot day bring lots and lots of water, we made this mistake as there is not much shade at all. Mileage will vary on how long it takes - I would say unless you're planning to go speedily allow an hour to the top and another hour to appreciate the view and make a careful descent. Walking boots or at least trainers definitely advised.To get there, there are a couple of buses from the civic centre (106+7, I think) that will take you up to Kloof Nek - from here you can take a right turn onto signal hill road and it's about 500m to the trail start. There is a hut at the bottom with a man selling ice cold water, and there are also taxis which hang around if you feel like getting one back.Oh and a final positive - I don't know if there is someone there every day, but there was a park warden who sat about halfway up/walked around checking that people were alright,which I thought was a nice touch in terms of safety."

Needless to say I did it and it was so worth it! I went up for the Sunset and ti was everything I hoped for. Keep in mind if you go up for the Sunset you have to have a torch to go down and if you are not familiar with the trail you need to follow someone and let them know you are following them. I had a group come down with me and I was so thankful they did as it was pitch black.So bring a back pack with water, torch/flash light, high emery snack, light jacket for the way down if you are going up for the sunset as the temperature will drop a bit.The are also two ways up. One from the road and another halfway up. I did the entire climb and I am glad I did. If you are short on time, start at the second higher up starting place. You can get Uber or a taxi from here, I did find that Uber was easier and quicker."

Have also done this hike starting from signal hill, up lions head and down Camps Bay, walking back to the starting point in sea point. During summer there are lots of people going up, from young children to older persons. Winter is typical Cape town weather with rain and wind. Beautiful to catch the fog rolling in as you get to the upper half. There is also a full-moon hike, where you hike up to watch sunset and the rise of the full moon over the ocean, and hike down in the dark. Take flash lights or headlamps. I don't generally use water, as it's such a quick hike, and no bathrooms and have seen everything from snakes to something that looked like a tarantula just off the route, but always take some gummy sweets and a fruit. During the full moon hike there are people who ensure no one wanders off the route in the dark, as it's quite a drop going down."

It's not necessary to go all the way to the top in order to see everything. As you wind your way around the mountain, you enjoy glorious views of Camp's Bay, Signal Hill, the V&A waterfront and Table Mountain. It's well worth the effort, even if you don't go all the way to the top."

There were lovely views all the way up and spectacular flowers to see in amongst the rocks. On the steep upper sections of the climb you are helped by ladders and chains conveniently placed. It's easier to go up them than down them though. We intended to go down via the \"recommended\" route (safer as it's not so steep) but couldn't find it from the top of the mountain having not gone up that way - better signposting needed."

The path meanders around so as you go higher you get a different view of the City and surrounds.Once on top, you have breath taking views of the City, Robben Island, Table Mountain and the Atlantic Seaboard with Camps Bay, etc.Many of our students rarely if ever gets an opportunity to experience the outdoors in such a manner, so it is extremely learningsome. From seeing a variety of birds to dassies to the occasional scorpion, etc, coupled with the indigenous fauna, rarely can one go home without having learnt or experienced something new.The best part of hiking to the top is scaling the chains, not recommended for the elderly or faint-hearted and care must be taken as serious injury can happen. For those not willing to brave the chains which is a \"short-cut\" to the top, the longer pathway is an easier option.Care must also be taken to take extra clothing because at times, the weather can change instantly and that can be disastrous. With taking larger groups, ensure that adults/bigger teens are responsible for x-amount of the group for further safety.One of the better walks is when there is full moon and to take a walk up just before sunset, enjoy the moon setting and later stroll down.Please ensure that you are more than one person for safety both for injury and possible muggers as there has been a few incidents of mugging happening."

Early on 6Sept, like 5a.m., we set off from the parking area of Lions Head to climb up to catch the sunrise at 7a.m. (it's way earlier in summer). You can wear running shoes or lightly treaded hiking boots and a head torch was necessary as it was dark. The climb is mostly easy on a jeep track and well marked pathway. The route is well signed with the option near the top to go a slightly and easier route around or to take the vertical ladder, chains and hand grips embedded in the rock. Once on top you get a 360 panoramic view of Cape Town below, Robben Island in the distance and a birds eye view of Table Mtn...and much more. It is advisable to wear sunscreen, take water, a backpack with a light jacket in case. Well worth the photographic opportunity and experience. It is quite popular so be prepared to share the mountain and path way and please don't leave your litter."

Our tour operator took us here during a day tour of Cape Town - it was so close to Table Mountain it seemed a waste not to check it out ... and it was certainly worthwhile.The local tourism authority has constructed several (5 or 6 I think) yellow frames for folks to take photos of Table Mountain - the yellow symbolising the National Geographic way of presenting photos ... and one of these frames is available in the park where the road to Lion's Head terminates. While this park isn't really at the peak (you have to go walk a steep trail for that), we were happy with the experience of looking from there as the views were really very good.There is a paragliding company that operates what looks to be a 5-minute experience gliding down to Camp Cove from this park that looked fantastic ... If you're visiting Table Mountain, it'd be a shame to miss out on some great views from this place ... and provided that you're not wanting to climb to the very top, a visit is easily done in 30 mins."

We visited Lions Head in August 2015 after finding out the Table Mountain cable cars were closed for maintenance. The trip was fantastic and after the climb we were really proud of making it to the top. The views are stunning and it took us about 4 hours in total to make it to the top and back. There is a mixture of gentle slopes, rock climbing and then vertical climbing as you get nearer to the top. As you climb all around the mountain you have a different view every 10 minutes which means you keep interested and amazed by the stunning views of table mountain and cape town. One thing I do feel I need to warn people about is that even with a good level of fitness this climb can be quite unsafe. There are handles and metal chains to help you up and ladders (although one has a steep drop underneath and a slip could be fatal). Rocks and ground can be uneven and falls away quite often under your feet. My partner stood on what appeared to be an stable area of ground and it gave way and he fell 10ft down the side of the mountain which was terrifying. Thanks to the help of strangers we managed to stop his fall before he gained momentum but this could of proved extremely dangerous. I felt that the reviews hadn't quite prepared us for this level of risk despite us being very active people who always seek adrenaline activities! Just make sure you are wearing shoes with good grip, take a jumper and make sure you have your hands free (don't take over arm bags). I also took a chest harness for my GoPro as it will be impossible to climb and hold a camera at the same time!Overall a very active, exhilarating and beautiful day out but just go prepared and be careful where you step!"

It was a clear sunny day and the hike gets progressively more difficult as you go up. We had a 78 year old in our party and she was able to do the first third of the trail, which was clear and wide. After that, it gets more rocky and narrow, so she opted to stay in one of the viewing areas, which was perfect. The rest of us climbed our way to the top, and were rewarded with the most stunning views of Cape Town and Table Mountain. It was a crowded Saturday, so I would try and go on a weekday to miss the crowds. We had been doing a lot of touring in a van, so a day out hiking was the perfect event for us. There are some narrow areas with steep drops, and ladder, rope chain climbs, so best to do this on a dry day to avoid mud and slipping. Everyone loved it, age ranges from 23 to 78!!"

Unfortunately everyone knows about it and the route have become very crowded.It isn't a tough climb and someone of relative fitness can reach the top in about 45 minutes. The views are spectacular!There is no water along the route, so bring your own. Also, be careful when walking along some of the narrow pathways higher up, people regularly slip and fall off the mountain. I don't find the pathways dangerous, one must just exercise caution and not consume alcohol before or during the climb. There is a point on the climb where one can use chains to haul yourself up some steep cliffs. This section isn't for everyone, but there is a much simpler (but slightly longer) way round the side of the mountain and is sign posted. I always take the way round to avoid the risk of injury. Also note that there are occasionally muggings on the mountain, so leave most of your valuables at home, only bring the necessary items along. Having said all that, this still remains one of my favourite activities to do in Cape Town!"

When we got to the top we waited a bit, and were rewarded with breathtaking views of the city, the water, and the surrounding mountains. There were alot of other groups, especially local sports teams, that seemed to be doing their daily workouts on the mountain, so we felt very safe the entire time as well."

Great place to view the Sun as it rises behind the mountains in East. I presume the Sunset will also be very beautiful.

The brochure said that it was fun, 2 hour, family friendly hike. My friends and I are not super fit, but we're fit enough to do this hike and it was more like 3-4 hours. Also, there are ZERO guard rails, and looking back through the news it seems that there's a fatal fall every few years. Do not recommend if you're afraid of heights. There are several spots where you will have to do a bit of a scary climb. It's very doable, but if you're the panicky sort, you might want to skip. Be very careful not to lose your footing on the way down. I would not bring small children. Totally a personal opinion, but I wouldn't bring any of my own children until they're at least 7. Then, when you get to the top, there's NOTHING LIKE IT IN THE WORLD. So, if you're physically capable of doing this, you have to do it before you leave Cape Town."

It is firmly easy to park as most people using this road are heading to the adjacent Signal Hill. My advice for any one wanting to walk up Lion 's Head is wear good footwear and be prepared for a fairly good work out! Also take plenty of water to drink. The only mistake we made was starting the walk at noon on a day when the temperature was already 32C - not a problem if you are prepared to sweat a lot and not go into Cape Town after.The walk itself is stunning - starting on the side of Table Mountain you get some great views of the mountain and the 12 Apostles. As you go up you then get great views of Camps Bay, Clifton, Signal Hill and the city of Cape Town. A lot of people enjoy the walk and stop to eat on the way up. For me whose balance is somewhat less than optimal using a pair of walking poles made the journey so much easier to do."

It takes about an hour to go up and an hour to come down. the views from the top are amazing. The majority of the hike is quite straight forward, however as you get closer to the top you are faced with a few minor obstacles that have chains and ladders to help you navigate. There are a few options to go around the chains and ladders, but you have to know where they are...not well marked. I don't like being in an exposed position, but I didn't mind the chains and ladders. I went on the hike at 9am to beat the crowds, but because it is not an overly challenging hike, it was already very busy. No matter, it was still worth it."

Bring enough water (about 1.5L per person) and maybe warmer clothes because the weather can change quickly and the higher you get, the colder and windier it is. There is a small shop to buy snacks and water at the bottom of the mountain, btu nothing else going up. Also, bear in mind that some trails are narrow and you'll come across some hikers. Adventurous, pleasant hike with a beautiful reward at the end. Big highlight of Cape Town"

I would suggest wearing sturdy walking or hiking shoes/boots and taking a snack & water or juice with you to enjoy at the top while you catch your breath & enjoy the view. A walking stick would be helpful as it can be slippery in places. The walk should take you 2 - 2.5 hours, up & down."

It gets very difficult at points clambering over very steep rocks using hands and feet. You don't need to be particularly fit but you do need your wits about you. I saw a woman in tears because she was so afraid of heights. It takes about 2-3 h to complete. The views are well worth it!"

We had a guided tour of the area called district six, an interesting area historically that calls for a separate visit/review. From the district six we saw the view of the mountain with a single top shaped to the profile of a lion's head. So of course we had to go there to take a closer look at its habitat. Having been at the table mountain and learning to know the fauna, it came as no surprise to us that the same unique fauna could be found at Lion's Head. It is an impressive mountain, as so much else of this fantastic country, but if you have been to the table mountain, you really do not need to see also Lion's head. The history of the mountain entails some interesting facts, as e.g. how the area have been protected by the community by not allowing exploration between the mountain and the outskirts of Cape Town. The Cape Malay, another example, is an area inhabited by an ethnic group of people that springs from the Javanese people that were brought to South Africa by the Dutch as slaves between 1650 and 1824. Still Malay ancestry lives in the area at the very foot of the mountain. There is, in our opinion more to learn about Lion's Head and the surroundings than what can be experienced only by paying it a visit."

In fact we had intended to get the aerial cableway up Table Mountain, but because of the cloud it was closed for several days. Then there were the dreadful fires on the mountainsides near Tokai and so again it was closed. The last day we had the opportunity to get up to the cable cars the traffic and volume of cars and coaches was manic. So we decided against it. However, I think we got just as good a view from Lion's Head without all the crowds."

We were going to take pictures of the sunrise in summer and so we started the hike at 5am. It took us about 50 mins from the foot to the top. The hike gets a little intense as you near the top but it was well worth it. All in all it is quite a safe place to hike as some modifications have been made on the side of the hill to help climbers. Lots of people hike up the mountain in the dark and that just shows how safe the place is.By 6am the place was already busy with runners, photographers and tourists who had come to see the sun rising over the city. From the top one has a good view of the City centre, Green Point, Gardens, Vredehoek, Table Mountain, Signal hill as well as Camps Bay and the Atlantic.The hill also has caves on the side. they are not as easy to access but definitely worth a visit for the adventurous lot.It can get a little cold up there so be sure to dress warm and wear proper hiking shoes. There is NO entry charge to go up Lions Head and hikes can be done at any time."

If you're not afraid of hights (just a relatively short path before reaching the top) and OK with doing also an intensive climb (but again, only short part of the overall), then don't miss it. The climb takes about an hour, depending also on 'the crowds'. Most of it is a very gentle but consistent climb that takes you up as in a snail trail, around the peak, and always higher. The last part, if you didn't pause too much until there, can take your energy away, as it's steeper and involves (if you choose the more direct and faster option) climbing a few SIMPLE and short ladders. It becomes a quite narrow path for a while, before opening up to the wide and relatively flat peak, that seems to have room for everyone. The views are truly 360 degrees, and simply amazing and beautiful. Many people stay and even climb up right before the sunset, which means that before and after that time, the path will be quite crowded and will impact the time of the climb. Overall - don't miss it. BTW, I climbed it up on the same day that I climbed the Table Mountain, and it DID make an impact on my tired legs. That's why I also had to do it alone :-)."

Nonetheless, when you reach the summit, all of your efforts are recompensed by the wonderful views of Table Mountain, 12 Apostles, Camps Bay, etc. We would reccommend going early in the morning or late afternoon to avoid the heat."

The start of the hike is not from the Signal Hill car park but from the road on the way up to Signal Hill. In summer I recommend you start early, say 6-7am and have breakfast up there - it only takes between 40min - 2 hrs depending on your fitness level. (some nutters run up and down as a weekly fitness routine) It can become crowded during peak season. ( Dec/Jan dispite the wind, Feb is generally windless) There is a moonlight hike at the full moon, you get to see Table Bay bathed in silver moonlight. Being up on Lion's Head at sunset is awesome but be careful of having alcoholic sundowners, you still have the hike back down!! There are 2 routes - one with chain ladders (fun to do), one without ( a bit longer walk). There are no facilities on top, so use the loo at the Signal Hill ablutions before you set off. Never hike alone, there is safety in numbers and if you are traveling alone look on the Internet for hiking groups to join. Lastly, though I've said it's an easy hike, it is a mountain and caution is a must or you could end up with injury."

            "review": "Favourite mountain in Cape Town. I have been walking up lions head since I was a kid, and it is my absolute favourite for a number of reasons. Firstly the start is near the centre of Cape Town, so you don\u2019t need to drive much to get there which makes it extremely convenient.Secondly it is not nearly as long as Table Mountain, which means if you just have a morning, and want to get some great exercise and views, you can be up and down relatively fast.1.5 hrs up and down (in total) for the fit! and could be much less for the super fit exercise fanatics.Thirdly, unlike other mountain walks, the path revolves around the mountain, so you get amazing views of the city, sea and distant mountains from all sides.The walk is fun with a bit of scrambling up the chains, and pulling oneself up and over rocks. There is nothing monotonous about it.Just bear in mind that the uphills can be quite steep, and while I certainly think it is suitable for kids and less experienced walkers, it is not a super easy walk. You are dealing with heights, and a small amount of balance, so not recommended for the very unfit, or those who are super scared of heights.The former can however always walk a bit of the way up, and stop and enjoy the beautiful views while the rest of the party carries on.It has a wonderful summit where you can sit and picknick for hours.The cons are I've heard from various people, that in peak season, and at peak hours, the mountain is becoming unbearably full. The path is not that wide and I have heard stories of people queuing to walk up certain bottle neck parts like the chains. So I guess it would probably be best to avoid this, though morning, and close to sunset are the nicest times.It is also possible to go up at full moon with a torch. You can literally see the moonrise and sunset at the same time specifically on the day of full moon. This also gets pretty crowded, so be prepared.Bear in mind that there have been accidents and fatalities up the mountain, so stick to all the usual hiking precautions. The weather at the top is obviously changeable, and if you start the walk too close to sunset you will be coming down in the dark."

This hike up Lions Head, which lies adjacent to Table Mountain provides spectacular views of Table Mountain itself, Camps Bay, the City Centre and parts of the Cape Flats. It is picturesque and well worth the effort of getting to the top. As hikes go, it is a walk straight up. Do not be fooled by the fact that many people casually approach this hike and make it up and back down. To enjoy it a moderate fitness level is required because it is a walk up from the start with no flat parts and a return via the same path. The hike is not technical but there are many places requiring extended climbing over rocks that form a part of the path. For those that are afraid of heights, please note that there are three sections requiring climbing up on ladders afixed to the face of the mountain with one climb utilising steel hand and foot hold and chains to climb. At this point of the climb requiring the use of chains, there is an alternative route that is marginally longer that requires no climbing. The two ladder climbs however, cannot be avoided.There are also parts of the hike where the path is about 2 meters wide, with a steep drop off on one side. If you go off the edge, prospects for survival is marginal. About two days after I last hiked Lions Head, a hiker unfortunately fell to his death. I donot mention this to scare you off the hike as its is a wonderful one with many kids as young as 8 years old easily making it to the top. I mention this simply so that you come prepared and donot treat this as a walk in the part. Under estimating it or not respecting it could get you hurt. Please enjoy this hike responsibly."

We are experience hikers so we had 1,5 liters each of drinking water with us and good hiking shoes. But we saw lots of people with flip flops, carrying no water and they were struggling in the heat, this is dangerous! It is very step near the top, with some almost vertical scrambling required. It takes around 1 hour to get to the top if you are fit. We recommend that you start early, at least 6AM to avoid the intense heat and huge crowds later in the day.At the top you are rewarded with a magnificent view!"

If you are injured or have vertigo you are going to struggle. It took us 75 minutes to get up and the view is sensational. There are chains 3/4 of the way up but you can walk a longer way round. The very top has some precarious steps but you'll be fine. Allow time to sit on the top and hang out. Take some crazy dramatic photos. Soak it in. Check out Camps Bay, 12 apostles, Table Mountain, the new soccer stadium, etc. Fantastic."

If you're not terribly fit, then take advantage of the few shady spots along the route to take a breather and check out the view.

My husband had done the hike before and raved about it, so we trudged up to Lion's Head on Christmas morning (not sure what else there was to do) in the fog to hike to the top. This is not for someone who is not in good shape as there were several difficult, steep climbs requiring use of chains and metal steps drilled into rocks. It was challenging but very fun. My sons (20 and 17) were grumbling at the beginning but as it got more challenging they became more interested. When they got to the top, they were very happy they had done it. At the top the fog was still with us so no view, but I have seen photos of the beautiful view so it is well worth it. You can go and hike just a little ways up and still see a nice view of Camp's Bay, so a group could go and split up. When you look at Lion's Head, it is hard to believe you can hike to the top, but you can, and it is well worth it. It took us about an hour to get to the top - faster coming down."

I'd highly recommend it (the views are super both on the way up and at the top particularly, and well worth the effort). But don't be fooled. It's not for the feint hearted or the unfit. Without stating the obvious it's all uphill! Meanderingly at the start but steep enough as you get higher. There are a few bits that are hairy but in those locations there are ladders/ropes. Most people in average shape can do it with a reasonable amount of effort\u2026.we are a family of 4, with an 8 and 12 year and we all did it, so that's good perspective. Like any activity in SA, bring a rucksack with water (carrying a bottle is a pain because you need your hands in several locations) and wear a hat and sunscreen. A proper pair of sturdy runners/boots are in order also\u2026.no flip-flops. Totally different experience to Table Mountain but it's much more satisfying and certainly not as crowded! 8/10"

In my opinion it is one of the most visited sites in Cape Town, always busy with tourists and locals alike.(with good reason)It is a GREAT hike/run for anyone of reasonable fitness.It is STEEP.You have to set aside about 2 hrs if you hike and take in the views and about 1 hr if you run, and turn around at the top, not taking in the scenery.You are rewarded with GREAT views.There are also many great trad climbing routes on Lion's Head (granite and sandstone) and there is a good climbing guidebook available at most Cape Town climbing shops.As I said, it is always busy, so if you want to have less people, go very very early in the morning.The route splits at just over halfway, with an easy option (slightly longer), or an option where you ascend a small rock face with the help of steel clips and chains bolted into the rock. Most accidents happen at the chains so if you are not sure/confident using the chains, rather go around and take the easier route.There is no water or toilets on Lion's Head.The views from the top are spectacular, looking out over Table Mountain, Campsbay, the ocean and the city.A very popular activity is to pack a backpack and then picnic at the top. Please note that if you do this and stay until it gets dark, please take a headlamp to get down.Lastly, the main route up Lion's Head is the most used, but for the more adventurous, there are quite a few alternative and very rewarding routes to ascend Lion's Head."

However things get rewarding son as you wrap around the mountain once and are presented with views of Camp's Bay, Table Mountain and Cape Town city bowl. During the climb there are a couple of spots where you have to make use of sturdy metal ladders. This brings you to a fork in the road where left takes you to a normal walk/hike and right takes you up a cliff face with chains and steps to make this route easier. The cliff face is not as daunting as it sounds but sometimes, because of the number of people on the mountain, it can be a bit of a wait.Take some water along and keep hydrated. Also if you are a smoker, try and keep it to a minimum and bring a container along for your ash and the buds as this is a national park."

For those who like to pass others on the trail just let the slower people walking ahead know which side your coming up to pass on. For those slower walkers in groups remember to stick to the side so you don't create a jam for those who are going faster. It can be a risky hike for those who don't pay attention. A fit person it will take you about 35 mins to climb up and run down. I think the record is 25 minutes up and down running. The moon light walk is a lovely walk - it is an organised experienced. Take up some tea and rusks, or coke and biltong for the top. It is worth sitting down an appreciating the 360 degree view around Cape Town with Table Mountain on the one side. A Camera is a definite.

The hike itself isn't easy, but only takes about 50 minutes. Getting to the top was 100% worth the hike. You get a perfect view of the coast and of Table Mountain right nearby. Towards the end of the day and when it gets cloudy, it can get a bit cold at the top."

It took us about 1,2 hours but we made lots of breaks to enjoy the vierw so I guss you'd get up within 50 minutes to 1 hour depening on the fitness level.So when we were up it's a beautiful view over Capetwon, table mountain, 12 apostels and the bay. Even a better view than frok table mountain!When the sun touched the ocean we decided to back down to the easier path. We had headlights with us (take them!!!) but we didn't wanted to climb down in the darkness.Even from a lower level the rest of the sunset was awesome. I recommend it to everyone. If you fitness level is not that good stay at the lower level. You still have a good view over the bay and you can enjoy the sunset.I'd do it againCheersPs: we get there and back with a taxi. Was about 100ZAR in total"

Perhaps luck was on my side on the morning we went up it was very cloudy so I could not look down. It is more of a climb than a walk and I found the walk to the base of the head more tiring than climbing Lion's Head. It does get busy and there are some fitness fanatics who run up so just be aware so you don't get pushed over. There are chains to climb up the head, but we took the longer route as I did not want to climb the chains. Once at the top - it was all worth it. The clouds lifted a bit so we could enjoy the scenary below. I am not brave enough to do the full moon hike, maybe some other time. The walk is free so that is great."

Take warm gear to put on at the top and a light/torch for your walk down. Keep hydrated and perhaps something to snack on at the top. Wear good hiking shoes. See the lights of Cape Town come on as the sun sets over Camps Bay area and the moon rises in the East. A great fun thing to do when you have the time. Enjoy.

Start hiking with the crowds an hour before sunset. Grab a spot and watch the sunset over Cape Town and linger for the moon to rise. When the moon is high enough, it will light your path to return down, though headlamps/torches are encouraged.Note: If you are scared of heights, there are a few passes, that especially when crowded are intense and you are close to an edge. You may want to not go or limit how high you go up."

Do not go without a liter of water (even in winter) Sunblock is a must (you are in Africa) and comfortable shoes (hospitals aren't a good place to spend time on in a holiday) Compared to other Hills and mountains in the area, this one is the easiest climb for the most rewards. Get prepared to wind your way on a circular path and be treated to all the views this city has to offer in one go. There is the city bowl. You get the ocean. Look for the 12 apostles. Throw in uninterrupted table mountain in all her glory. Just past the halfway mark you have the option of two paths. To the left the road keeps winding up. To the right it gets a bit technical with chains and a small ledge or two. The right is definitely the shorter route if you are up for a little adventure. Be careful of the slippery tree roots and before you know it you are at the top. Great for the best sunsets in the whole of Cape Town. "

Police also patrol the bottom of the path and there is security cameras on your way up. About 90% of the path can be walked and the rest is a bit of a climb. There is a easier route as well for the not so advanced hikers. To give you an idea: some locals go with the small dogs (Jack Russels) who is able to go almost to the top without much assistance.

Middle aged probably make it look difficult!It starts very easily but the end is tough and keeping your eyes down and concentration is essentialNot for those with no heads for heights. Certainly made me feel faint in a couple of places"

The first section of the climb is a steep slope which is a path but as you get further up the climb gets a lot harder. You have to climb rocky sections and some parts are vertical which you need to use chains and foot holds to climb. Once at the top however the views are spectacular and well worth the climb. The best time to go is about 3pm so it is not as hot and you get to see the sunset. You will need to wear sensible footwear and take plenty of water and suncream. A good alternative if table mountain is closed."

It's fairly easy if you are of a relative fitness but it is by no means difficult and no advanced skills are needed. The chains can be tricky to climb for some people, but you can always skip them and walk around. The views at sunrise and sunset are spectacular. It is also popular to climb Lions Head during the full moon, and something a lot of people want to tick off their list. If you climb it during the full moon, expect huge queues. It took our group about 1h30min to descend after viewing the full moon. A trick is to go a day before or a day after the full moon as it still looks very much like a full moon, with less crowds. If you are going in the morning or evening (Especially evening), pack some warm clothing as it can get cold quickly especially during winter. Also, there has been some crime like muggings, and although rare and there is now increased security, I'd recommend walking in groups and during daylight hours."

Find out what time the sun rises and aim to get to the base about 1hr 15 before.The climb itself require a certain level of fitness. There are parts where you are rock climbing, not hiking. If you're lucky, there's a chain that you can hold onto whilst you hoick yourself up. Other parts have stirrups that you can use as a leg up.

The trail is very well marked, somewhat groomed at the lower elevations where protea were just blooming. As you go higher, the path narrows and has ladders in places where you'd otherwise need climbing experience to continue on. There's a short cut toward the top that takes you up rungs and lengths of chain drilled into the rock for hand and foot holds. That can feel a bit hairy, but well it's worth the effort. 306 views from the top of Cape Town and across to Table Mountain.There are parking guides at the base to help you locate a space since that can be a bit of a challenge on busy days."

Then I took a left and headed up towards the start of the trail. The whole journey took around 5 hours, easily done in 3-4 hours I just did some photography and as I completed an 11 hour flight that morning I was rather tired. Very simple long and windy paths up to the base of the lions head (I can't see the shape of the lion, more like a pineapple). This is when it can get a bit more technical as there are chains and ladders to use to get higher as it wraps around the back of the mountain opposite Table. Once you get to the top take some amazing pictures, have some fruit and food and then head back down. I recommend it and would say kids from 8+ however each to there own. People seem to take dogs up here which would be difficult as the ladders are quite steep.I fully recommend."

Given the location of Lionshead, you will even have a better and 360 degree panoramic view compared to the view from table mountain.It is rather easy to get there: right of the point where the road to Table Mountain begin, on the top of the pass between Downtown and Camps Bay, you go the opposite way: Signal Hill road. It is the first point where many cars are parked.The hike takes about 1h15 up and 45m down, for an untrained person. On the top there is some climbing involved, so hand and arms are needed. There are no severe drops close to the path of the hike, which would scare people with moderate fear of heights (like me). For the severe cases: you are climbing a mountain where you have a view of 670m above sea level: think twice.On windy days it might be smart to bring some extra warmth protection and be more careful during the climb. Also bring water as there is no water around. It was certainly worth the effort and I enjoyed the view more than from the top of Table mountain (also because you don\u2019t have to share it with 100s of tourists)."

The walk up is very beautiful, on the way up we stopped to watch some of the Paraglider's take off over Camps Bay. Before reaching the summit there is one part that requires the use of chains and ladders - this is the part I found most fun. If this isn't your thing there was a sign directing people to an easier route.Unfortunately once we arrived to the top the clouds covered up most of Table Mountain however we still had a beautiful view over the city. I can't imagine how glorious it would be with no clouds but you can't control Mother Nature! Descending down was a little hard on my injured knee (there are lots of steps and rocks to scramble down) but in the end it was well worth it and my trip wouldn't have been complete without climbing Lions Head.I definitely recommend this hike to everyone, if your fitness levels are a little lacking you can still do this hike, just allow yourself a bit more time and lots of water. I also recommend doing this with another person if you are a little worried of heights. It was nice having my partner there to direct me down the chain part.Enjoy!"

It is much less crowded than Table Mountain yet a good climb with the last part quite steep but fun."

It leads all around the mountain and offers spectacular views over the city, the 12 apostels, the sea and Robben island as well as Table Mountain. The path is easy to follow. Further up I took the shorter way with some ladders, all safe and easy to manage. If you are not so fit and want to avoid the ladders, take the \"recommended\" path to the left (a little longer). It took me just about an hour to get to the top. The allround view is breathtaking. Allow 2 1/2 hrs round trip. Wear good footgear, a sunhat and take a windbreaker and waterbottle along."

We took some bottles of wine and some food to with us and were just in time to see the sun setting :) Be careful when you go down. Firstly, when you go down after dark the way down is a little more difficult (cus you can't see much) so be sure to take some headlights or use your phone flashlight. that works as well. Secondly, hike down in a group of at least 4 (and be sure to have one or two guys with you) just to be sure not to get mugged. That would be just plain stupid.... But overall, it is a great hike, less people than on table mountain, also great view to each side of the city."

Most visitors do not believe how much the weather varies, not only from the top to the bottom of Table Mountain but between the seaside and the town side. You can have a fairly still day on the northern side and very fresh winds indeed on the south side.This also applies to Lion's Head. Under the right conditions and in the evening, it is particularly worth the trip because you can sometimes see the moon rising when the sun is setting. I think it is a good walk which should be taken at a leisurely pace but beware, robberies are not unknown. On 17 December 2013 a tourist was robbed and stabbed. This is not a regular occurrence by any means, more like once a year, but who wants to be the first?South Africa has many opportunistic thieves who are frankly hungry or frustrated so don't walk around with any indications that you might be well-off, for example flashing a designer bag. Keep your money well out of sight.

Hiked up from camps bay (not easy to find), but would recommended this, as the main trail from main parking can be very busy. Went up on boxing day, there were a lot of people on the last 100 m (ladders), so if you go up a busy holiday, start your hike latest at 7h. Lions Head does not have the 'table cloth' problem alike Table mountain which ofetn is covered in clouds and won\u00e4t have a view hence"

Although we had been up table mountain once we wanted to go again but unfortunately extreme winds meant it was closed for the last two days of our visit to Cape Town. We decided to go for a hike here and amazingly there was hardly any wind! It is a proper hike though so you need to be prepared. Take sun block. water and wear a sunhat and sensible walking footwear. There are places that are quite tricky so not advisable for people who aren't used to hiking or find long walks difficult. We told the rest in our group where we were going which is always advisable. As others have said don't wear sandals or flip flops this isn't a gentle walking experience! It was fantastic. Views amazing and the walk and climb felt like a really good work out!"

Once you get to the rocks you are pretty much scrambling on all fours, clawing your way up the mountain, with deadly drops all around. Tip: DON\u2019T WEAR RINGS OR BRACELETS as they get horribly scratched on the rocks. I rate myself as a reasonably fit 50 year old. But I found this hike to be well out of my comfort zone, certainly not an 'easy walk' for me.There are two routes to take up, almost everyone on the trail was going the \u2018hard\u2019 way, but part way up I found I couldn\u2019t reach a hand grip. So we turned back and took the \u2018easy\u2019 route up. I think being short (5\u20192\u201d) was a handicap as I simply didn\u2019t have the stride and reach to easily navigate the rocks. (I know that many people shorter than I will have found it no trouble at all)\u2026. But I am being totally honest here.But once at the top I had a very keen sense of satisfaction - and apprehension as I knew the decent was probably going to be harder \u2013 and it wasn\u2019t. I found the best way down was on my bottom - a lower centre of gravity is the key. (most women were opting for this technique).So, I am glad I have done it. I have been told Table Mountain is an easier, but longer climb, hmm we will see\u2026."

Great place to get up to and have lunch whilst enjoying the panoramic views; not to mention the challenge of just being out (up) there.Take:- Water (one litre per person was good for us)- Good footwear (running shoes are fine)- Light weight clothing as it can get hot- A small backpack with a warm jacket and hat inside as weather can change and become cold- A cap- Sunscreen- CameraWe set out from the carpark at the base of Lions Head and took the longer route close to the top and it ended up taking us 90 minutes at an casual pace. Whilst a lot of earlier reviews I had read suggested an easy climb, I think that these might have been written by long legged people in their 20s; knowing this for that is what I would\u2019ve written at that age.Unfortunately the passing of the years does have an impact on the body and I realised a while back that I wasn\u2019t the \u201cmountain goat\u201d I used to be. However from the perspective of a human male in his late forties the climb is definitely achievable; it just did not feel to be in the \u201ceasy climb\u201d category.Picnic style lunch at the top is a must; since you have invested the time and sweat in getting up there, you must take the time to enjoy the views offered which are spectacular on a sunny day.Do check the weather before heading up; if the wind picks up whilst you are on the head, it can take the fun out of it."

Then there are sections where there is really no clear path but large rocks to climb over. Finally you reach the top with a 360 degree view of Capetown. At the top you can reward yourself with a snack if you carried one and just sit back and enjoy the view. On the way back down we watched a paraglider take off and ride on the thermals. I would suggest you dress in layers and bring sun screen, water and a snack. Hiking Lions Head is a great way to spend an afternoon in Capetown."

Last trip I took my 7 year old daughter with me and she managed fine. Safe hike and not to advanced. The views are amazing and give you a full panoramic view of the city as you spiral up to the summit. Best to do the hike early in the summer months before it gets to hot as the trip is exposed with little shade on offer. Late afternoon and night trips are popular. If you looking for a bit of a party, every full moon about 2000 people hike up in the late afternoon to watch the sun set and the full moon rise. You hike down in the darkness and can be done without torches depending on cloud cover. This trip should be on every able bodied tourists list of to do's when visiting the city if Cape Town."

It is also a very safe area with your car, due to car thefts in the past, the community has pushed for security that now watches over your car. So you can hike without worry.

(See my previous posts). Nevertheless, there can be few, if any, cities in the world that offer such a wonderful scramble within the city boundaries. There are no hidden dangers but one does need a head for heights as the helter-skelter route that winds round the mountain is fairly exposed in places.I did it early one October morning and was rewarded with cloud inversion views from the top with Table Mountain floating in bright sunshine above a sea of cloud. I was short of time and charged up and down from the car park at the base of the trail in 90 minutes. I would advise allowing more time than this just to allow space to soak up the experience"

You will be able to see Cape Town and its ocean from different sides. An absolutely stunning view. There are beautiful flowers along the path as well. The final parts are a little more steep and you'll need to climb a ladder (there is a real ladder installed there so no worries, it's easy). I believe the walk from the 'entrance point' (it's free but there is a little information cabin) to the top took us about 1 hour. Nice to walk your dog here too (which we saw several people doing)."

It's a relatively easy walk up for the first 30 mins or so thereafter it becomes a scramble over rocks and up a couple of ladders. Make sure to wear good walking boots and stretchy trousers (for the big steps up). It's well worth the short climb for the fabulous 360deg views over Cape Town, Table Mountain and Camps Bay. We finished our walk by heading towards Signal Hill then towards the city. however note that this returns via the back of Bo Kaap and we felt a little uneasy as we strolled through the housing estate in our hiking gear, clearly tourists!! Wouldn't recommend this walk on a wild day as I'm sure that a strong gust of wind might result in you taking the fastest route down!! Sun cream, a camera and sunglasses a must."

You walk surrounded by wonderful nature and, paying a bit of attention, you may see agames and common snakes relaxing on the rocks near the path.

Being a bit wary of heights I found the last bit quite difficult as there was some clambering up fairly steep rocks, including a couple of ladders and I knew we would have to return the same way on the descent. The view from the top was spectacular, especially of Table Mountain, and there is a fairly large flat area at the top to sit and eat a packed lunch. Being unfamiliar with the route we booked a guided walk and would highly recommend Margaret Mcurran of Table Mountain Walks, who collected us and dropped us back at our apartment and is extremely knowledgable about the area."

If you're reasonably fit, there's no reason why you can't do this hike.The first part is very easy to navigate -- just follow the jeep track and then the path. The problem comes when you get up to the chains. If you don't want to climb the chains, then you'll need to find the alternative route. If you've been climbing this route every week, it's easy. But if you've never done it before, you can get lost, and falling is a reality. So be careful!Also, definitely don't take any valuables with you, even your rings and watch. And I always attach my car key to my clothes in case my backpack gets taken from me. I've never once had a bad experience -- or any type of robbery experience -- when hiking on Lion's Head. But I've read about enough cases to take precautions. Also, make sure you don't go up alone, and even if you're in a group, make sure you're walking at a time of day when there are others around. So early Sunday morning you'll be fine -- if you don't mind the crowds! Get there at 7am summer, 8am winter, to have just enough people. Any later and it's hectic!Take water! And please take your rubbish off the mountain -- one sweet wrapper, one cigarette butt, a banana peel -- you're ruining the environment if you leave those behind."

The path gets very narrow towards the end with two routes to choose from that lead to the top. Take the longer route (no chains or staples to climb) and get several 360 degree turns around the mountain with great views of all the local communities. Plus, all the tourists and people wanting to be \"extreme\" think the chains and staples are so great that they form lines to go up and down them. I wasn't hiking to wait in line, I just wanted to go up and down. On that note, there are normally lots of tourists and locals alike on this hike, so be courteous and give way to older people and the large groups. Some of the locals even enjoy RUNNING up and down this peak, so be courteous and give way to these extreme athletes!"

They also told us that it would be an easy walk, that you COULD climb a shortcut if you wanted to, but otherwise there was an easy path around it. We believed that too and went in normal shoes (!). What we DID do right was to bring a water bottle, shades and sun protection (hats). All together this turned out to be one of the most exciting and beautiful experiences ever in Cape town area. It is a must! On the top there were individuals, couples ans small groups of people, meditating, eating or having conversation. But there was this magical respect for the greatness of Nature and the magical feeling that you really made it up (as they all did up here). Now you were entitled to enjoy the breathtaking, 360 degree view! There were groups of retired people, middle aged and youngsters. It is challenging bu possible. It is not a walk in the park though. A couple of times you even have to climb on ladders (!). But we already are hoping for weather when we can do it again! This cost nothing and is not promoted in the ordinary tourist fliers.

The city of Cape Town is surrounded by mountains, there fore it is only right that you should get to the peak of at least one whilst you are in Cape Town!Lion's Head is more manageable than Table Mountain, doesn't eat as much of your time whilst scaling it, but still manages to give you a great workout, and rewards you with stunning views of the city."

I should have started earlier, it was such a large crowd so there were queues at many points along the way. The first half of the hike is easy and straight forward. Those who doubt their ability or are afraid of heights can stop here and still have amazing views of the sunset and sights below. The majority of the remaining hike is challenging, not always marked, and frequently on a narrow trail with an unprotected drop on one side. This being said, there are young children hiking the trail, it is not dangerous but you must be careful. It took just over an hour to reach the top, where many others were laying around and watching the moon rise. The views from the top are amazing and totally worth the hike up. The climb back down was a bit tricky because I didn't bring a torch and had run out of water. I would definitely recommend bringing a torch, and more than one small bottle of water."

Lions head does tend to get overcrowded on a good day and there is very little shelter from the heat so plenty of liquid is advisable - Lions Head has a few hazardous places which the visitor needs to be aware of and lives have been lost on what most people perceive to be a straightforward easy climb. Extreme care should be taken at all times. Alcohol is not a good idea on Lions Head in my opinion, it could impair judgement and this could have disastrous consequences."

He loved it, but be warned: It's not for the unfit, or the faint-hearted.There were sections where chains had to be used to clamber up the rocks near the top, and there were a few rather narrow areas to navigate.My husband was amazed to find some teenagers walking barefoot up the mountain, despite the scorpions (he saw a large one) and snakes in the area!Make sure you don't ever walk alone on the mountain. Always, always remain with a group for safety."

After about fifteen minutes the hike narrowed and we started going upward more steeply- but at least we were in the shade. In an hour and a half, we reached the top. We were soaked with sweat as it was the middle of summer, but thankfully we had water, cookies, and grapes to snack on at the top. My brother and I took the more fun way- the way up the rock with chains and handles that you \"use at own risk\"- both up and down. Our parents took the much longer way and we had to wait at least ten minutes for them to catch up. The views (on a clear day, of course) of Table Mountain, Table Bay, Robben Island, and Cape Town are breathtaking. So are the two ladders that are necessary to get to the top. Don't go up wearing a skirt and sandals and expect to be done in an hour. Not like I did that, but I saw someone else. She was not smiling."

If the hike up Table Mountain seems strenuous, this is a great alternative (and is lovely in its own right!)

It takes you 40-60 minutes up (and same down again) and the view is great all the way up, as your walking round and round the hill (unlike Table Mountain). If you happen to be in Cape Town during full moon, you should join the locals and start off an hour or so before sunset, catching the sunset and full moon rising from the top with a glass of wine and good friends.

Towards the top you have the option of the easier route, or of the direct route up using the chains and footholds. We took the chains,( and we are in our 50s). It was not far, and a bit of fun. We decided to come down the easy way. The walk up is through beautiful hillsides of proteas and other wildflowers. It took us oldies a fair bit longer than the hour and a half promised in the guide book, but that's probably because we stopped to take about a hundred photos."

It is best to obtain a local Capetonians\u2019 advice, but in general \u2013 it is accessible; a tough work out and it is relatively safe. One can also hike this mountain at night when it is full moon - the views are spectacular with the sun setting in the west and the moon rising in the east. Always be on the lookout for the ever changing weather conditions in Cape Town. Park your vehicle or let a taxi drop you at the parking lot near the foot of the mountain. Be prepared with an anorak, something to eat and water. Dress in shorts and a short sleeve shirt, but pack a warm top too. Do not carry items in your hand \u2013 rather in a small day pack on your back. Leave all valuables and large equipment at your hotel. You can complete the total walk/ climb in 1 - 2 hours if you are very fit; longer if you have children with you and if you want to spend time at the top. In general it takes equally long up and down.The first part of the walk, on the gravel road, is steep, so take it slowly. Follow the walk around the Lion\u2019s rump and enjoy the changing views. It is magnificent to be above the city and have a 360 degree view at the top. Take extra care and be conscious at the section with chains. Savour the experience and tackle the descent slowly. Enjoy!"

In low season the trail is crowded and I can't imagine how many people are here in peak season. The hike should take about 1 hour up and down in average physical fitness. There are no facilities after the start of the trail so bring everything with you including a jumper, sunscreen, pancho, food and water. Use the bathroom before you go or risk exposing yourself to all of Cape Town.As stated in other reviews it is very windy. The trail is marked well and there is no possible way to get lost. Bring a torch or flashlight if you intend early morning or sunset hikes. The trail is divided into to two grades. The initial sloping part and then the second half which is more rocky steps."

            "review": "Tips and suggestions from a Lions Head regular. As a Lions Head regular I am going to begin with a few helpful tips, especially for those visiting Cape Town on holiday and planning on hiking up Lions Head:HIGHLY RECOMMENDED:1. You need to wear takkies / sneakers / trainers.2. You need to wear a pair of shorts. (I see too many tourists struggling to do the hike in jeans / long pants).3. You need to take water. (I usually take a 500 ml water bottle)OPTIONAL:1. Put a few food items / picnic into a backpack, as it is lovely to sit, have a few snacks and enjoy the view at the top.2. Take a camera there are lots of amazing views and photo opportunities.BEST TIME AND CONDITIONS TO HIKE:1. Do this hike when it is not windy. When it is windy it can be unpleasant, and you will find that the higher up you go the windier it gets.2. Personally, I think that the best time to do this hike is in the late afternoon. That way it's not too hot., and when you get to the top the sun is starting to set which results in beautiful views. In the SUMMER time, If you are a slow hiker start hiking at 4 in the afternoon, if you are a faster hiker start at 4.30 or 5.3. Many people hike up Lions Head to watch the sunset, as the view of the sunset from the top is beautiful. If you are going to stay to watch the sun go down then you need to either leave soon after the sun has set, or take a torch along, so that you can find your way down in the dark.OTHER INFO:1. The trail begins on Signal Hill Road. The start of the trail is about a third of the way along Signal Hill Road. You can get a taxi to drop you right at the start of the trail.2. The start of the trail is a wide gravel path that slopes upwards. There is a metal bar / barrier in front of the path, simply walk around the metal bar and continue up the wide gravel path.3. It is an easy path to follow, and during summer there are normally lots of people hiking up and down along the path.4. I have seen MANY children doing this hike and they all seem to love it, so take your kids along!5. The hike is not a difficult one, and as long as you are relatively fit you should not have a problem getting to the top.Last, but not least, this hike has the most spectacular panoramic views. From the top you can see the ocean, Robben Island, Table Mountain, Signal Hill, The City Bowl, The Twelve Apostles and more. It is truly truly beautiful.Enjoy your hike!"

Early mornings and sunset offer the most breathtaking all round views of the city, the harbour, Robben Island, the Atlantic seaboard, and of course Table Mountain. You experience many different views as you climb up in a spiral around the base of the mountain. If you're superfit you may mange to get up in less than 30 minutes, but it's more likely to take an hour each way. If you don't want to climb the steep staples and chains (used to be chains only) you'll be treated to a wider range of views and terrain by hiking past and around on the left."

Take the normal hiking precautions of making sure you take the necessary water, food, windbreaker, sunscreen and hat (the weather can change quickly so check the weather report before walking). As you walk up the mountain the most beautiful views unfold with a full 360 degree view from the top. It is unmistakably the best view of Cape Town! As you ascend there is a choice of the chains or you can continue walking around the mountain which will take you to the same point, so don't be put off if you are less adventurous. You can even walk to a point where you are comfortable and just enjoy the view and smell of the fynbos (the local flora). This is a popular walk at full moon, it is wonderful watching the sun set over the ocean and the moon rise over the Hottentots Holland mountain range but if you go up on full moon it is VERY popular and busy, you are often queuing to get up and down the mountain and it is a bit dangerous as you walk down at night by torchlight. http://dostuffct.com/activity/lions-head/lions-head"

Path is narrow towards the top, unpaved, and uneven. In some places you will climb ladders to higher levels. It is difficult to pass other people when busy, so allow for this. If climbing in summer MAKE SURE you are adequately prepared! The summer African sun is harsh and dangerous, esp between the hours of 10am - 3pm. Suggested commencement times are <9am and >3pm in summer, noting the total time in the sun. Ideally avoid being topless, or even sleeveless. Sun lotion (>SPF20), applied often, is an absolute must. A hat, ideally wide brimmed, is also a necessity. Wear practical walking shoes, and loose-fitting shorts. Take lots of water, min 1litre per person. Views from the top and along the way are stunning. However there are few places to stop and rest for any extended period. If with young children note you may have to carry them on return journey."

Drive along the road to Signal Hill to the trailhead and park on the pavement across the road. Water and drinks are available for purchase in the shack at the entrance. There are no bathroom facilities. You will be hiking on a path that spirals up to the top of the rock feature that sticks out of the range. We saw many hikers with dogs. First part of the trail is a relatively steep gravel road, but it is not too strenuous. You will come across the launch site for local paragliding companies. Fun to stop and watch a takeoff. The next part of the trail includes manmade wooden steps as well as natural rock steps. (You're getting higher!). Some rock scrambling comes into play. There are metal rung ladders, chains and handles to help. The last part of the trail is the most challenging but not undoable. If you go slowly and think about where to place your feet and hands you'll do ok. The views along the way and at the top are breathtaking. The water near the shore is clear blue and green. You can see Robben Island, the harbor and waterfront, many prominent buildings and people populating Clifton Beaches and Camps Bay. Plan to rest up there for a little bit.Going back the way I came up, I found that I felt safer sitting down on the rocks and sliding onto the next level. It's helpful to be able to use your arms to lower yourself. Take water with you, do not do this on a very hot day and plan to spend about three hours round trip, depending on how much stopping and gawking you do."

Not sure what is best, the views from Lion's Head of CPT and Marina area or the pictures you can take of Lion's Head from the city or from Table Mountain. Luckily, if you can go to CPT, you will get lots of time with Lion's Head in the background or hopefully on the actual mountain if you can afford the time to make a hike there.

Due to the fact we wanted a good amount of time up there, we visited when we had just picked up our hire-car, which worked out perfectly. You could get a taxi but would incur charges whilst they waited for you and there is no taxi rank at the top to catch a different taxi down (like at Table Mountain). It is definitely worth stopping at some of the many lay-bys on the way up to the top. Not only do you get some amazing views but also very few people stop on the way to the top, so you get the views all to yourself! Once at the top, there is a good amount of parking but not plenty. We had to wait a few mins to get a space, so I would suggest going earlier in the day before it gets too busy. Some people just wonder up take a few pictures and disappear off. Many people take picnics with them and some people just wonder off and go for a walk along the top, which is highly recommended and very beautiful. It is certainly an attraction which should be visited as the views are amazing."
