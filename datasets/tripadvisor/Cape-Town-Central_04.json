It was very interesting to learn what the doctor had to go through to perform the operation, and how he got the donor. There are a few wax recreations on display but it would be nice if they had just a little bit more. The guide was very knowledgable and answered all our questions confidently. I think this is one of the must-do things in Cape Town."

I was not disappointed!For the City Sightseeing ticket-holders there was an offer of a free shuttle to the museum which is located in the historic and iconic Groote Schuur Hospital.This is a private museum with tours by appointment only for one of 3 guided tours a day. Our guide was a fantastic, very eloquent and knowledgeable lady who witnessed the Dr Bernard era first hand. She was an amazing story teller!It was especially exciting to see Dr Barnard's office with his silicon figure disturbingly accurate and lifelike and fully restored operating theaters where the first human to human heart transplant surgery took place. We also enjoyed the movie. There was plenty of time to browse through the exhibit's many artifacts, photos and memorabilia."

My parents were with us, and they have no medical background, and usually do not love museums, and they found it very interesting as well.Of note, the museum runs by guided tours (9, 11, 1 every day). We at first were hesitant to take a 2 hour tour on our already busy day, but it was well worth it! Our tour guide was the former personal photographer of Dr. Barnard (the surgeon of the first heart transplant), and had amazing personal stories to tell about the surgeries and Dr. Barnard's life. If you are a student, bring your student ID and they will give you a discount."

As a nurse who trained in this iconic and historic hospital in the '70's, it was very moving to return with my family and visit the incredibly well reconstructured Heart Museum. Everything was done with great attention to detail and as our guide had been Chris Barnard's photographer we gained a deeper insight into this brilliant man's life and achievements. Well worth the time and expense. And as a postscript, we learned that Chris was revered in Italy, from correspondences and press articles in the museum, but it was still a delightful surprise when on a recent visit to small village in the south of Italy, an old lady, learning that I was from Cape Town, beamed, \"Chris Barnard\" at me."

This marvelous museum commemorates that historic event. You will be shown the actual operating theatres where the medical drama took place - even the diseased heart of the recipient Louis Washkansky is on display !The donor Denise Darvall - who died tragically in a car accident - is of course also not forgotten.There are amazingly realistic latex models of all the people involved to add further interest to the exhibits. Also shown are letters from Dr.Barnard's admirers from all over the world .You can also watch a short but moving film about Dr.Barnard. This is one of Cape Town's most underrated visitor attractions and should not be missed by anyone interested in history or medicine. The professional guide-lecturers are also outstanding. Perhaps not suitable for young children."

What a wonderful experience from beginning to end. The staff were all so enthusiastic and gave wonderful insight into the first heart transplant and events around it. The guided tour takes about an hour and a half and one is free to explore afterwards. Realistic theatre reconstructions, a lot of memorabilia and all of this in the actual place these historical events took place. I found myself quite moved by the lives of all the characters involved.

Also featured are the exact same operating theatres preserved, complete with old equipment, and silicone figures of the surgeons performing the surgery. The museum also honours the family of the first donor and in general has an extensive collection of newspaper clippings of anything concerning Groote Schuur Hospital.

The Heart of Cape Town Museum is located at the Groote Schuur Hospital and requires a taxi or car, since it is not in the central business section of Cape Town. It is well worth the visit, as the tour guides are very knowledgeable in both the scientific, medical and personal lives of those involved with this piece of history. There are many facts and situations that led to the first successful human heart transplant. Coming from Minnesota, I was not aware that Dr. Christian Bernard received his surgical certification from the University of Minnesota, as well as ongoing research funding when he returned to South Africa. We learned how factors of apartheid, governing laws and local cultures heavily influenced each step of the way. We were also blessed to meet Dr. Cecil Moss (born 1925) who was visiting the museum while we were there. He was part of the medical team (anesthesiologist) who removed the heart from the first heart transplant donor, Denise Duvall. This experience was one of the highlights of our one month tour of South Africa and should not be missed."

A historical site one should definitely visit, the Heart of Cape Town Museum is one attraction that gives a glimpse at the pioneering work of Dr Christiaan Barnard and his travails as he revolutionized Human Heart Transplantation. Back in the day when this field of medicine was relatively experimental, the Museum documents the lives and fates of the first few heart transplant patients and the circumstances that led to this revolutionary and now life saving technique. This is one attraction one must visit when in Cape Town not just for its historical importance but for its medical pioneering breakthrough as well."

Our guide, Christine was extremely knowledgeable... you could spend an entire day just looking at the various displays! Go for the morning tours if you plan to spend more time in the museum. Caveat: It looks like they increased the prices AGAIN and it's now R300 per person for international visitors and R150 for South Africans and students. A bit hefty in comparison to other museums within the city that go for a tenth of that price."

When I was visiting Cape Town , I had the good fortune to visit this not-very-well-known attraction, The Heart of Cape Town Museum. This is a museum complex in the Groote Schuur Hospital on Main Road in the Cape Town South Africa. The hospital was founded in 1938 and is famous for being the institution where the first human heart transplant took place, conducted by University of Cape Town-educated surgeon Christiaan Barnard on the patient Louis Washkansky in late 1960 s. The entrance fee inclusive of the guided tour, which takes two hours, is 200 Rand per person , and the guided tour was done by a well-informed nice lady who was ready answer all my questions.You can see the original rooms where the first heart transplant surgery occurred. It utilizes the same operating theaters originally used in December 1967 when Denise Darvall and her mother were rushed into the hospital after being struck by a vehicle. The theaters contain ancient equipment, complete with life size wax figurines of the surgical teams in two theaters, and Dr Baarnads office. Then there is a shop for memorabilia and souvenirs.Being a Surgeon, I really felt the challenges faced by Dr Barnaad, nearly 50 years ago, with the primitive equipment at his disposal, with very little knowledge of what surprises and nightmares to expect.The guided tour includes a film show, and you can see so many items related to the first transplant, including the anesthetist\u2019s notes.I recommend this place to all surgeon , and I am sure they will go through the same emotions I went through.."

There is an extensive range of photos, documents and videos, but most impressive are the life-size silicon figures of the operations in the theatres actually used in 1967. The hearts are also there! The visit consists of a 2-hour guided tour - we had a very informative and engaging guide (Trace) - and you are free to look around afterwards to take in the detailed information. There is an interesting movie and plenty of anecdotes. This is an excellent tour, which I would strongly recommend. It is under-rated on the list of things to do in Cape Town."

It\u2019s still not expensive if you are a foreigner (R200 when I went) and considering that covers a guide for 2 hours in a small group it\u2019s good value.I got to and from the museum by public transport using the MyCITI bus, with a 20 minute walk from the bus stop (catch route 102 heading towards Salt River Rail and get off at Upper Salt River stop)."

For anybody with an interest in history or medicine it is equally fascinating.The museum is located at the Groote Schuur hospital and starts off with the triage room in the ER where the donor was brought in after her accident. From there on it is an incredible story of the man and his science. It is hard to believe that it was almost 50 yrs ago. Overall not much has changed in the technique since then.The tour guide was extremely knowledgeable, having worked in the hospital as a nurse before. The photographs, letters, accolades that poured in are all a slice of history that the world may have forgotten. Some parts of the tour may not be for the squeamish. The recreation of the OR is minutely detailed, up to the blood spatter on the surgeon's cap and the blackboard that is so ubiquitous in every OR in the world. The skill of Dr. Barnard is evident in the autopsy specimen of the donor heart that is on display. It is truly an astounding tale and well told, deserves to be heard and seen. A wonderful tour that is unparalleled anywhere else in the world."

My mom and I continued on the tour. There were many interesting letters and documents, and you really got a sense of the drama that unfolded for this surgery to happen. I really loved the letters kids wrote to Dr. Barnard. There are also displays portraying the actual operation, situated exactly where it happened.

This is down-right wrong.Troughout the tour they kept on saying that apparteid was bad and that Barnard believed all to be equal. That there was no difference between a black heart and a white heart.However these people believe that there is a difference between a US / European wallet and a South African wallet.When confronted about this they claimed people do it everywhere and if Hong Kong can do so can they.

We had an excellent guide who really enthused us about Christian Barnard and his route to becoming the first successful heart transplant surgeon, much to the chagrin of the American medical fraternity. We enjoyed a short video of Barnard and then proceeded to visit the actual operating theatres,being two adjacent theatres, one for removal of the deceased's heart and the other where it was inserted into the patient. The theatres are set up with realistic replicas of the people involved (made by the UK Madame Tussauds modellers), providing an eerie reality to the experience. There are also many photos and letters of the time attesting to his deserved fame and celebrity.This was an excellent exhibition well worth the time and fee."

Christiaan Barnard undertook the world's first heart transplant (dec 3rd 1967) in the operating theatres at Groote Schuur hospital in Capetown and here you will be present in the actual operating theatres with all the original equipment and every member of the team actually undertaking their task, all recreated by Madam Tausauds in rubber rather than wax because of the heat in South Africa. Barnard is about to defibrillate the heart he has just inserted.This museum honours the skill and wisdom of the transplant team, the courage of the recipient, the generosity of the donor's father and the memory of the young donor herself.The guided tour takes 2 hours with one of the most knowledgeable guides I have ever metYou do not have to be a medic to really appreciate this visit.

As both a Nurse who worked in an operating theater in 1965 as well as having a family member who is a transplant recipient... we wanted to visit this Museum. It is well worth the two hours we spent there. The guide was very well informed and the Museum not only reflects the transplant from the medical perspective but from the community and family perspectives as well. They do not try to gloss over the egocentrics of Christian Bernard but I think presented him in a very balanced light. The world reactions are well represented and quite frankly I had forgotten the extremes of peoples feelings about the event. Very happy that we went. The man at the desk who greeted us is just a gem (as are many people here). We felt welcomed and warmth from the very start. Just walking through the walls and floor tiles carried me right back in time.....I am not sure that a person outside of medicine would gain as much from the authentic recreation of the operating suites but still and all would learn a lot."

How Dr Christiaan Barnard would have marvelled at the many skills that today's heart surgeons are able to perform and the many, many years that all those patients are now surviving due to him, being the maverick that he was and the loophole in the South African law making the whole beginning possible. The many operating theatre models and Barnard in his office are stunning and very lifelike, as are all the various other exhibits and photos. You may be surprised at how interesting this exhibition is considering the tragic nature of how it had to begin with the death of someone to give life to someone else but that is what makes the whole subject absorbing.

From there it was to the museum where we had a fascinating 2 hour tour of the small museum led by a very well informed guide who certainly knows how to tell a story.The fact that life sized mock ups of the donor and recipient operations are presented in the actual theatres where the operations took place, together with much of the original equipment, gives a real sense of history. And the wax models of the operating teams are so life like that you almost expect Barnard to say \"scalpel please, nurse\" (although by all accounts he may well have omitted the \"please\"!)What is really fasciniating is the background of the development of the techniques and particularly the political and ethical background. Mixed in with this are the very human issues about the way the early transplants affected the patients and the families involved. It also tells the story of Barnard basking in the fame and what happened to him in later years.This is a truly unique insight into one of the most momentous developments in medical history. Cape Town has much to offer but if you only have time to do one thing, visit this museum."

They really did a good job recreating the build-up to the first heart transplant and the actual operation. I walked in not knowing a thing about the place other than that the first heart transplant happened there. By the end I felt like I knew Christian Barnard personally and like I had actually watched this historic event take place. An excellent tour."

This museum is located in Cape Town, at Groote Schuur Hospital. The original theatres were restored, and the set-up is like a real-life presentation of what it was like in those days. The whole story of that first heart transplant is told by artefacts and a wonderfully trained guide. The personal experiences of the family of the donor and of the first transplant patients are told, together with the experiences of Dr. Christiaan Barnard. A moving place with personal biography mixed with advances in medicine."

It's a 2-hour tour and costs R200.It's a story about how the first human heart transplant took place. Showing through video clip, walking through rooms which tell about the donor, the team of doctors, the recipient and silicon reprica of the operation.The curator had done such a great job that you hardly noticed time had gone past. She is concise, knowledgeable and humorous. I am not a museum goer, neither am I a medical professional, I find the tour very interesting, educational and inspiring.

The tour is led by one of the museum guides and consists of a 40-minute video followed by the guided tour through rooms designed to recreate the story of the first heart transplant, including the stories of the donor, recipient, transplant team, and the operation itself. The museum is filled with silicone replicas of the operation, old ventilators and operating room equipment, newspaper clippings, actual anesthesia records, congratulatory letters from all over the world, and more. The actual rooms that the operation took place in are part of the museum, making it extra special. Admission is 200 rand. This is an interesting little museum that should be on your list if you have a background or interest in medicine or the history of medicine. Since I meet those criteria, not surprisingly I loved the museum and gave it 5 stars. It could absolutely be educational and interesting to those outside of medicine too, but I can understand why some of the other reviewers thought the museum was boring and/or not worth the admission fee. However, if the above description piqued your interest go visit this museum."

            "review": "Great medicine, but.... We all know that the story of the first heart transplant is a great story to know, but the tour has a few problems. First, the tour is WAY too pricey. R200 ($20) is too much for what they have in the museum. $10 would have been a better price. Second, the tour is TWO hours when it should have only taken an hour. Therefore, the tour is VERY redundant to get that two hour mark and the museum has pointless things in it like a replica of what Denise's room MAY have looked like. Nice, but it doesn't add anything to the tour or story. I'm not even sure this whole story needs an entire museum and a two hour tour. Maybe just the recreations of the operations and an couple interactive videos. Sure this is something for South Africans to be proud of (and I won't even go into my opinions on whether the surgery should have been performed under all the conditions you'll learn about in the tour) but the museum and 2 hour tour are overkill. Shorten the tour and keep it more focused so non-medical/scientific people will find it interesting. My husband claimed he almost died of bordem!"

It was fascinating seeing the actual operating theatres, one where the heart was removed and the other in which it was transplanted. The clock in the operating theatre it stopped at 6am, the time which the transplanted heart first started beating on it's own.You are shown the actual heart from Louis and the original stitches made by Christiaan Barnard are still clearly visible.This is a fascinating tour and insight into the medicine of 1967 and what had led to heart transplants being performed routinely today.The hospital itself is a beautiful building.

Having guided tours at this museum in 2008, NO not a normal museum, rather a living memory of one of the greatest human achievements, one is constantly stimulated by the true story of a young man driven by his mother and personal amibition. This is a 5 Star guided experience by stimulating ladies (and sometimes men) who have a passion to share the life experiences of Christiaan Barnard and show you the 2 theatres that appear alive with well crafted manquins plus the Barnard office, animal reserch lab, and recovery room with Louis W plus other images that bring this story in history alive. You will leave thrilled and excited and full of wisdom."

Interesting, educational, life like!\nSomething we as Capetonians can be proud of.\nA great achievement w.r.t the first ever heart transplant and the effort to keep the history alive.\nThe presentation was worthy of the event.\nWell worth the visit.\nIf I remember correctly, entrance fees were a bit steep, especially for locals."

The recreation of the surgical rooms is a little creepy and seeing Louis Washkansky in bed was very odd. If you are into medical history this place must be great. If not, you may want to spend your time elsewhere. The rest of the family found it interesting and enjoyed the visit, but it is not a place we would push our friends to visit, unless we knew they were into this kind of exhibit. It is definitely a piece of history and the artifacts are remarkable."

The museum itself was famtastic - very interesting and a unique piece of history.I particularly liked visiting the original operating theatres - the wax works were so real - especially Lou in bed !However cost is high for 'foreigners' (I resent this title). It should be less expensive and then perhaps more people would visit from overseas.Less price = more visitors = more publicity = more revenue."

Not only for those who do recall the drama of Prof. Chris Barnard's first human to human heart transplant, but even for those with an interest in medicine, this place is fascinating, well done .... maybe even a little creepy .... but I mean that in the nicest way!We (a group of six) first visited the museum shortly after it had just opened in 2008, not knowing what to expect, but we were hooked from the moment we entered the hospital museum's doors. It left an incredible impression on all of us and we felt privileged to be standing where medical history was made. On a recent visit to Cape Town with more friends in May, one of whom is a GP, we were so happy to take them back to Groote Schuur Hospital and to see this museum again for a second time. For us, it was as good as the first time, and our 2nd lot of visitors loved it. The recreations of the operating theatres and situation rooms are amazing, these are the very corridors and theatres where all the action happened, with apparently much of the original equipment and/or furnishings. (Even the original donor heart is in a jar!!). The tragic events that lead up to the transplant are cleverly presented as though it happened yesterday, and with compassionate sensitivity and tribute to the donor and her family, also. It is quite moving and we all found it compelling. Perhaps that is because on both occasions we also had enthusiastic, knowledgable guides.Do yourself a favour and see this place. You won't see anything like it anywhere else, esp. as it all happened right there!"

Th two hour guided tour takes you through the history of Chris Barnard and the first successful heart transplant with a whole plethora of videos, recreations of the operating-theatre, offices etc."
