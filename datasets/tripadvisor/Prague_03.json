The guide David was very interesting and fun! He made the tour a perfect mix of fun, culture and views! He also took a lot of photos which he mailed us, to ensure we had memories of our days in Prague!"

They picked us up from our hotel at 7:30 AM and took us to Karlovy Vary and to other cities within the Czech Republic. Not only were they professional but personable and actually caring. My husband is not as comfortable as I am and our teenage children, however whenever there was a situation that may have made him that much more timid either Stan or Robert were there to encourage him to move along. We have done many Segway tours and found Stan and Robert to be the best guides we have had. We used Pedal Power in Vienna and would never use them again. They could learn about customer service from I LOVE SEGWAY. We returned to our hotel at 9:00 P.M. and all agree this was the best tour that we had."

We were guided by our guide named Clara. She was an amazing guide and she spoke very good English. She knew a lot about Prague and its history and she was very kind to us. The segway was very good and stable. We went up on a hill trough a park and we had a beautifull view on Prague. At first I was scared for the segway but with Clara's help I had an amazing tour with my son. After the one hour tour we got back in their office and we spoke to the boss. He was a very honest and responsible man.Thank you for the awesome tour, we'll come back here!"

I am a coward, but I had a very professional coaching and felt very safe during the trip. We were very lucky, because Besim is also a photographer.

Conveniently located just behind the John Lennon Wall, we were immediately impressed by the easy to use (and book) mobile website and how flexible and accommodating Stanislav was via email. It couldn't have been easier for us to pick a Segway tour that was tailored to our time frame and touring interests. Stanislav and our guide Besi took time to show us how to ride our Segways before we started, and Besi was very helpful, informative and patient throughout our 2 hour tour of the hills overlooking the city (we picked this route, because it complemented the sites we had already seen). I 100% recommend these guys, and I would certainly take another tour if our travels ever bring us back to Prague. In the category of \"icing on the cake\" was their offer of paints to use to add our own artwork to the crowdsourced mural that is the John Lennon wall."

I was nervous when my husband suggested segway: a) I dont have a good sense of balance; b) I dont like speed and c) I dont like to fall. Ivan our guide was awesome! He showed me the basic start, stop and turn but best of all was he was caring. He knew I was nervous so he took us slowly at first till I got use to segway. Throughout the trip he would turn to check on me and warned me of bumps etc. Overall it was a fantastic experience. Now I am a segway fan. Thanks to Ivan! He was not only charming, caring but full of interesting information. We learned so much from him. Segway is a beautiful way to see all the beautiful sights in Mala Strana!"

Arrived to the beautiful John Lennon Wall and were immediately approached: \"Here to Segway?\" We nodded apprehensively but were quickly ushered into an incredible tour led by a both knowledgable and amiable guide. After paying the modest fee, we spent nearly 2 hours afterwards painting on the John Lennon Wall and grabbing beers nearby with employees. A great tour deserves 5 stars. Feeling at home and being shown a great time deserves much more. I love Segway is worth a visit."

I contacted several companies via email prior to our group arriving and and Stanislav was quick to respond and all his messages were warm and friendly. Upon arriving the morning of we were not disappointed. Because of the size of our group they took us out at separate times. For those of us waiting, they entertained us! They are at the John Lennon Wall and provided us with paint to decorate the wall. After that they took us to a park and let us use their fun toys! The entire time the whole staff was engaging and had rich amounts of current and historical information about the area. An amazing experinece!!!"

Three of them had never ridden a Segway before and were a little nervous. Ivan (the guide) did a great job of teaching them and making them comfortable in the practice area before we stepped on to the streets. Most other companies start tours from the Old Town but we had already covered that area in a walking tour, so decided to do the tour in Mala Strana. It was a great experience because we went up to the Prague Castle and got a great view from there before going into the parks on Petrin Hill. Ivan was very friendly and gave us little snippets of information (such as about Gaston the seal) which made the trip more enjoyable. Would have been 5 stars except it is a bit pricy (we paid 34 euros per head)."

The tour guide was really nice. Though we have been on a lot of tours with a lot of guides and I can honestly say this was the best yet. Riding the Segway is really easy and after just a few minutes it was no problem to control them. We had ages ranging from 12 all the way to 62 and nobody had any sort of problem learning.The tour was around some of the prettiest parks in Prague and gave us some amazing views. We would have never done it on foot, seeing as there is a lot of uphill. We only did two hours but you could easily spend 3 or more hours. What was especially nice was how personal the service was. It almost felt like we had known them before. After the tour we spent around 45 Minutes with the whole crew, for which they did not charge us any money. While spending time with them we talked about politics but also about what to visit in Prague after the tour had ended. This is a very young establishment. It is located right by the famous sight, John Lennon wall, and while it is easy to miss this \u201cbackyard office\u201d is hugely helpful as it provides a space where to learn to ride these advanced pieces of machinery. Do not let their low profile office and young crew fool you. This service is absolutely TOP. There is no better Segway service in our experience.Pro:- Great service - Very personal tour - Good prizes compared to other companies- Great tour guide- Great equipment- Easy to learn - Easy to understand tour guide - Fun tour- They chose the perfect area for a Segway tour- Absolutely worth the money- There is lots of other things that we liked but we are trying to keep it as short as possibleCon: - While this place was a little cheaper than the other, overall Segway tours are expensive - Hard to find, if you don\u2019t know they are there- Everything else was great! \u2013 No complaintsWe can really only recommend this service. Despite the fact that it\u2019s not very cheap we are certain the money was well spent and we would do it again in a heartbeat."

            "review": "Great way to see Prague! Ask forJakub as your guide!. My husband and I were in Prague for a week and quickly noticed all of the segway tours when we arrived. They looked like a fun way to see the city so we asked our hotel for the best segway tour company and they suggested I love Segway. There were two options and you could do a group tour or a private tour and we opted for the private tour since there wasn't a huge price difference and it's always nice to get personalized tours. We booked late at night (11:00 PM) and they sent a very nice taxi to pick us up at the hotel the next morning at 10:00 AM. We were taken to the I love Segway office where we met our guide,Jakub \u0160. He quickly showed us the basics and then we hopped on the segways and practiced in the courtyard before we were off. Jakub was the best guide because he was informative (but not too serious) and he allowed us to ask a lot of questions. He also took my phone before we began and snapped a lot of photos of us along the way that we'll keep forever. He also captured some great sights and a few funny videos of us on the segway. We especially appreciated that he went out of his way to take us to some very scenic places to help us capture our christmas card photo for next year. He really wanted to make sure we were satisfied and we'd definitely recommend asking for him if you're touring with this company. Some things we learned: -It's probably better to book directly with the company if you can. We decided late the night before but saw that pricing is much cheaper if you book directly through I love Segways. -This really is the best company that we saw because they don't take you through the very congested touristy streets. Many of the other company's we saw were in the thick of it all and many people looked like they were struggling to keep up with all of the crowds. I love segway took us off the beaten path and to some amazingly scenic spots. We would have never seen the city as we did with the other tour companies since so much time would've been spent dealing with crowds. -The three hour tour was perfect but longer would have been too long. We were concerned about how long 3 hours can be but once we got going we weren't rushed and even stopped at a local brewery to have a beer half way through (we also took this opportunity to ask Jakub more about what it was like to live in the city). I think you can also grab a quick lunch, too, if you prefer."

She is very sweet and knowledgeably, and she carefully took us to the top of the hill overlooking Prague with amazing views. Riding the Segway is great fun and we will do it again! Btw, we are 63 and 59 years old..."

The guys that took us round were great and English, so friendly and there was no where else and with no other company we would have had the experience or service we had with these guys. There price was the same as other companies we saw and we got a private tour that lasted twice as long. If you want something to do in Prague that is fun, for everyone, lets you see all of the great sights then this is the activity and this is the company to do it with."

It was an opportunity to absorb the different views of the city on a track that's away from tourists. In fact, many times, it was just Klara, the tour guide and myself. Approachable and genuine, Klara was just awesome, pointing out interesting aspects and history of the city and telling few interesting stories. Midway through the tour, the weather got cold and rain started to fall, so we had a break at a brewery near the monastery. Needless to say, I'll remember this tour for some time. There are lots of Segway tours in Prague, but I chose this one since I got a very nice and prompt reply from its owner, Stanislav, and the prices were very reasonable as far as private tours go. Highly recommended!"

He offered a real good deal to show us around in Prague and took us to places we never would have known about. But besides all of that, he himself was too good to be true.

My partner and I booked a private tour. We spent 10 minutes learning how to drive followed by an hour and a half gliding up and down Petrin Hill. The late afternoon sun cast a magical spell and our guide made us feel both safe and special as he showed us the spectacular views and beautiful gardens. Highly recommended."

OK - yes, you can label me an \"American tourist\" but I really try not to embarrass myself when traveling in other countries. That is why I have avoided segway tours wherever I go in Europe. In most major cities you will see them and probably think to yourself - that looks ridiculous and how lazy can one be? Well the answer is yes, it does look ridiculous and yes, one can be very lazy, esp. when on vacation, but riding a Segway actually takes some balance and endurance skills. PLUS it's FUNNNNNNNNNNN! If you ever want to try it, do it in Prague. It's hilly and some of the coolest things are spread out so you can see a lot and laugh hard doing it. I highly recommend I love Segway company for this. The owner is super low key, happy and actually interested in making sure you are safe and having a good time. DO THIS. You won't regret it."

Segway!As a couple in our mid fifties, when we were looking to tour Prague a segway was not the first option that sprung to mind, we saw a few around town and asked our receptionist at Hotel Pod Vezi if he thought this was a good way to see the sights.He said it would be great, age no problem!After a little convincing he recommended, \"I Love Segway\" as it's a personal tour, so not so bad if you show yourself up. we were to meet the guide at our hotel at 10 the next morning.We met Klara, who was a lot, lot, younger than we were, she took us back to there office which has a quiet courtyard for practice in front of it,after a few minutes we were surprisingly road worthy and off we went.Klara was an excellent guide, letting us set the pace,we chose to go up through the parks for great views of the city, then onto the castle and back through parts of the city to the Charles bridge. Klara's knowledge of her home town was excellent and we had a great couple of hours touring round covering a much larger area than we would would have done on foot. So if you,re thinking about it but are feeling apprehensive, don't be it is as easy as it looks!"

As it would turn out Tom (our guide) was pretty good - happened to be a part time tour guide n Segway guide so gave a us a great tour around town, pretty relaxed stopped over for a coffee uphill (petran) & ended up spending about 2.5hrs instead of 1.5hrs.

Standa was kind enough to send a taxi to pick us up the next morning. We arrived at his office on time and ready to go. After a safety briefing and a few minutes of instruction, we were on our way. For the next 3.5 hours, we experienced Prague! Old Town, the three hills surrounding Prague, Lennon's Wall, racing through rose gardens... you name it, we saw it! Our trip to Prague was fantastic. Our tour with iLovesegway, stands out as our favorite activity. Standa (Stanislav) understands customer service and exceeding expectations. I highly recommend iLoveSegway"

The boys got a lesson and safety rules and were off and running! Stanislav made sure they had a wonderful time and got a second guide to help to make sure everyone was safe.

            "review": "***TOP PICK*** Stan is indeed...the MAN!. So I'm form New England, and have lived with our...how should I say this....\"uniquely\" laid out streets. When our forefathers were deigning these cities, you have to wonder if they were trying to make it as difficult to navigate as possible. If you need an example: Boston. If you've ever driven there, than you know what I mean...Until I traveled to Prague, Boston was, hands down, the most frustrating place to get around in. Now, without a doubt...Prague now tops this list. Now you must understand, being a commercial fisherman, my life revolves around navigating boats, often far from the sight of an land, to our gear, around other boats and back to the same spot from which we departed. All the while, constantly being aware of the direction of wind and tide. I'm saying all of this because whether I'm consciously keeping my bearings or not, I am always doing it. So when I had a week of overcast, and couldn't use the sun as a reference, I got lost more than a few times. I when I say lost...I mean like lost...lost.So when I got back to the hotel after the first day of aimlessly roaming around this amazing city, I was thinking I really needed to come up with a better strategy than the one I had...which to be honest...wasn't one at all. So after deliberation, I came up with three options:Plan 1) Group TourNow granted, I've been on some very good and very informative trolley tours in my travels, but I've also been on some VERY bad ones. And the day before, whilst walking the Prague streets, I saw a tour trolley, driver not saying a word, playing a recorded voice over a PA, while everyone furiously snapped photos out of the one side.I'm sorry, but I would rather shoot myself in the face then have to endure this...Plan 2) Rent a bicycleNow at face value this sounds like a great idea, until it dawned on me; I would be riding around just as confused as to where I was, what I was looking at, and where I was going as I was the day before...but I would simply be doing it faster than I would on foot.Plan 3) Ask the localsPlan 3 was by far the most productive!I asked the The Kampa Garden Hotel staff what their advice was. They recommended Stan at \"I love Segway\".Now, I wasn't sure if I did in fact love Segways. Especially since I saw different Segway companies very loudly and agressively arguing in Russian over what appeared to be a \"turf\" disagreement, in the Old Town Square the day before. It honestly all seemed kind of shady.But \"I love Segway\" was situated quite literally right around the corner from my quiet hotel, which was in a very nice part of the city, and thought I should at least give it a look. And I'm very glad I did! Stan runs his business out of a carriage house of a centuries old building owned by some Knights of something or other, nestled quietly in the back of a grassy courtyard that Beethoven was known to write music in. I'm not joking...I will say this, this is the PERFECT way to see a city! You are unrestricted as to where you go. Stan asks with a smile, \"What would you like to see today?\" You can decide what to see and where to go! And I can tell you what...Stan knows his city! And he speaks perfect English, and even lived in the States when he was young! I honestly have nothing negative to state... It was the perfect and personal way to see amazing and ancient city!Hands down, the best surprise of my trip!"

We had got to see not even half of what we wanted to see on foot in 2 days!. We were lucky to have a very helpful receptionist at our hotel who provided us with the contact details to Standa, the gentleman who runs I Love Segway as there was plenty of other companies who had flyers in our reception. We initially booked the tour for around Prague city. I had never rode on a segway before this experience. My girlfriend had neither but we picked it up in 10 minutes. We headed for Charles bridge and the square beyond. We took in all the regular sites of Prague initially. Then we went to areas where , not only were there no other segways around, but no other tourists either. It was a really great tour and in a single day we took in all the sights we had already seen on foot plus the other half that we didnt get to (and had a lot more fun doing it), which gave us more time for relaxing and having a few beers the following days. Excellent fun tour, great guides who will tailor a tour for your needs, (our tour ran over by 1 hour because of the extra sites we wanted to see and it was no problem for Standa, and he didnt even chrage us for it.) My girlfriend had always wanted to visit Czesky Kromlov which is about 2/3 hour drive from Prague. We asked Standa was there a possibility he could arrange a day trip for us down there with the segways and take in the sights there. He tailored the tour to suit us, at a very reasonable price and brought us on the most memorable trip we had ever been on. We got there early morning and beat the crowds. It really was amazing.Would I reccommend using I love segway (even if you haven`t used a segway before):Yes!Will I be using their services again: Definately Yes! I really wouldnt even look at another segway company there now. It was an all around fantastic experience and made our holiday."

His location is perfect on the west side of the Charles Bridge. This was our first time on a Segway, and Stanislav made us feel very comfortable and safe. He is a native of Prague and showed us things on our tour that we never would have thought to look for on our own. I would book another tour with him in a heartbeat should we visit Prague again. Thank you Stanislav for giving us the most memorable experience of our entire vacation!"

The guide Standa was very friendly, knowledgable and professional . I have seen hidden spots around the Prague castle I didn't know even existed. He certainly has deep knowladge where to take people . After arriving back home in Australia I got email with HD pictures from the tour Standa took of me - it just made my day! Service well and truly goes the extra mile, fantastic value for money, can't wait to do it again next time!"

Standa and several of his colleagues were out marketing their Segway tours of Prague. We had the next morning available and arranged for a 2 hour Segway tour for our group of 4. Standa arranged for a taxi to pick us up at our hotel and drop us off at 9:30 AM the next morning. All went as planned and we were taken to iLoveSegway's base of operations, which happens yo be the U Maliru restaurant. A couple members of our group had never been on a Segway and were a bit weary. Standa met us at the cab, paid the fare and immediately set to putting our minds at ease. After taking care of the necessary paperwork, we were given a safety briefing and brief, but adequate training session. Within 15 minutes we were on our way. Standa led us on a an amazing tour of Prague. From the Lennon Wall to the \"Eiffel Tour\" to the Metronome to the Prime Ministers House... We viewed Prague from the top of the three hills surrounding Prague. Standa scheduled frequent stops along the way to allow us to take photos and stretch our legs. He made sure we were comfortable with the pace and duration of the tour. Standa asked if we wanted to extend the tour for a bit ( at no additional charge) and we readily agreed. We returned to iLoveSegway's base of operations 3 hours later with smiles all around. This tour is not a lecture on the history of Prague. It is an exhilarating experience which allows you to see Prague in a unique fashion. I highly recommend iLoveSegway."

We opted for the All Inclusive tour, which ran us a little over $300 USD for 2 people. However, we were more than satisfied. Mary, who runs their operation, was prompt with her communication and even texted me often with info and updates. This type of modern business technique is not often seen in Europe, so it was a nice change. Once we arrived at the office, we were offered a welcome drink (go with the sparkling rose!) and met our guide \"Charlie.\" The all inclusive tour is limited to 8 guests, but we were the only ones for that day, so we really had a private tour guide. We did everything listed on their website and more. Charlie was an outstanding host/guide and knew all the secret spots to visit, back entrances to avoid lines, and all the history. Between seeing the key sights, sampling beer, sausage, a great Czech lunch, wine, river cruse, and other experiences, we could not have been happier. We certainly got our monies worth during the 7-8 hour tour. Everything we did was covered by the price of the tour. We didn't spend a single cent more. You rarely see anyone rated at 5 stars on trip advisor anymore, but these guys earned. Thanks!!!"

If you have only one day to do it all or if you just want a tour that doesn't involve a yellow bus, 30 tourists, a guide with a microphone followed by a large group of multilingual tourists...or if you want a premium experience then that's the tour you need to do. I randomly found it online after failing to find a better option with my hotel concierge. I was not disappointed. It was simply amazing. My wife and I ended up being just us two so that was pretty much a private tour. The guide was awesome. We went pretty much wherever we wanted to go and we learn a lot about cool stuff in the city. Yes it cost double the price the usual tour offer so if you are looking for cheap this is not for you. But if you are looking for an amazing experience with an old car ride, a boat ride, lunch, bear and wine tasting and a private tour, then I don't think there's anything in town better than this. This is a good 7 hours total tour so be prepared it's long. That includes a lot of walking obviously but it's done so you have breaks for tasting or lunch or rest on a boat for an hour. It's really well done and well organized."

He pointed out all the interesting features and supplemented with additional information as well. He was very easy going, even helping with translation when we wanted to stop for a drink and snack. He explained very clearly the historical sequence of events but also answered our other questions even though they were not related. At one point he was explaining what it was like to grow up in a communist country, which we found fascinating and hugely informative.I would highly recommend using this company rather than \"following the orange umbrella\"."

We weren't all that sure we even wanted to do another tour but we left our first one early and subsequently missed the Jewish quarter. So we booked up at 8pm for a tour the next morning, which was confirmed within a couple of hours. We arrived and they knew exactly who we were and told us that we were the only ones on the tour! Which turned out to be fantastic, never have I met a more knowledgable enthusiastic tour guide. Robert made our tour an absolute joy, he was a little shy to begin with but soon warmed up, he explained everything fantastically and his enthusiasm bought it all to life. He was happy to answer all of our questions, even the ones completely unrelated to the tour! He signposted things for us to visit in the future and showed us the entrances, pointed out nice places to eat and even translated for us so we could have a snack! He is an absolute credit to the company, as were the other members of staff we met before our tour. Everyone was so welcoming and made us feel important which was something we hadn't had before! If you're visiting Prague, this is the tour to go for, the all inclusive walking tour may be more popular but in my opinion it is not worth it. Book Prague premier tours instead, you will not be disappointed. We will definitely be going back to them next time we visit."

It just gives you that little bit of an extra boost that you need. You get to see a lot f the city with the bike from various parks, great views and the John Lennon wall. We stopped a lot along the way to walk through the castle briefly, walk through the cathedral briefly, and we learned a lot about history and Prague folklore. Great tour and we highly recommend this company!!"

We were corresponding with Mary who was very quick with her email replies. On the day, we met our guide Elois (not sure if I spelt that correctly). Took us to some nice restaurants to taste beer, wine and their local food. He tried to personalize it to what we wanted as we don't really drink beer. A lot of variety and definitely worth it if it's your first time to Prague. We had previously randomly gone to a few places on our own and they were all let downs compared to the places he took us. The tour was expensive but well worth it. The service at the restaurants and the wine tasting was much better than any of the places we experienced ourselves around Prague. Food was cooked perfectly. Elois is also a certified tour guide and told us a bit of history of places we walked by. Don't let his scruffiness fool you. He is very knowledgable and was able to answer all our questions with detailed explanations."

We contacted Mary who immediately responded with booking and requests about food allergies which did impact our family. When we arrived for our tour, everything proceeded along beautifully. We had a private tour with Robert who was a fund of knowledge about not only food but Czech and European history in general. It was very eye-opening for my mid-20s children who were not aware of the historical significance of this part of Europe over the last century and I appreciated the free instruction as well! The food choices were very indicative of Czech culture and there was an abundance of beer and wine as well! We were stuffed! I highly recommend this tour to anyone desiring a professional food tour that was very intimate and tailored to our needs as well."

We were a group of 4 and had two guides (Charles and Bert). Though it was only a 3 hour tour, they packed us a nice snack and provided water. Our tour around the outskirts of Old Town gave us great strategic views. The e-bikes are ideal for the hills of Prague. The guides gave us great suggestions of what to do and where to go afterwards. Great tour for initial intro to Prague. Their shop is located behind a courtyard."

If you are in Prague, please ignore the Segway tourist traps and go for a tour on an E-Bike with this great company!! Prague is flanked with hills upon more hills and with these E-Bikes we were able to glide effortlessly all over Prague to see some of the most amazing sites with 2 great tour guides!!This tour was definitely a highlight of our trip. The guides did a great job of taking us to all of the major sites! They were even kind enough to let us get off of our backs for an unscheduled stop so we could walk through St. Vitus cathedral next to Prague castle! They packed a lovely snack for us as well, which my husband was especially thankful for as he's of course always hungry!!Take this tour if you are in Prague and it won't disappoint!"

None of us were disappointed, from the amazing welcome from Mary (\"I remember you!\") to the guided easy bike ride with our two guides, we all had a blast.

We were gone for over 3 hours and the time just flew by. Our tour covered all the main sights with a lot of local knowledge and we were guided in and around traffic very safely. All in all I would highly recommend the hire and tour to anybody. Helmets are provided and they fit like no other helmet I have ever used before. A Snackpack and water were also part of the cost.

We took 2 tours the Ebike tour and the food tour with our 13 and 11 yr old kids and loved the both!We were very pleased with the Ebike tour and the fact that there were 2 guides. One was always in the front and one in the rear. This made us feel more comfortable and safe especially since we had the kids with us. There is no way we would have navigated the 16km up the hills without the ebikes. The views were amazing!The food tour was the best we've ever done! One of our kids has a corn allergy and they made sure none of our tastings had corn. It was a great balance between food and drink. My favorite drink was the fresh Rosemary \"lemonade\" that they made for the kids at the beer tasting. I also was surprised to have lemonade water keifer at the dessert place - a drink that is usually only served by home brewers. It was lovely! My favorite foods were the pickled cheese and beef dish. My only critique is that I would skip the Spanish restaurant so to have more time to savor the food and drinks at the other restaurants. We were a little rushed the last few places. The regional wine was excellent- I bought 4 bottles to take home!"

It was an excellent day and our guide Karel was so accommodating allowing us to stop for pictures, taking us to many interesting places and always having a story or 2 to tell. Karel was aware of Edinburgh where we come from so was able to say this area is similar to this and relate things to our knowledge and experience.We did a full tour of the city and saw all the main attractions and I assure you the bike absolutely does all the work for you. We even stopped for a beer and a chat half way through the day and to say it was like an old friend showing you their home is the best way to explain the experience.I can not recommend this activity or this company enough and so glad we chose the ebike rather than a segway tour. Safety was a top priority alongside our enjoyment and we left with a packed lunch which we hadn't expected, great memories and a list and map marked with recommended things for us to do and see for the rest of our visit.I say again, excellent experience and absolutely something to try."

The company was really detailed in preparing ponchos, gloves, water and a lovely snack box which they packed for me to bring with me after the ride as we could not stop for a picnic due to the rain. I was glad I went for an ebike as there were a few slopes along the route which would be challenging to maneuver a manual bike on. I would heartily recommend ebike Prague for the views, the care and just overall fun. A word of advice, if you are not already comfortable on a manual bicycle normally, perhaps consider postpone the tour if it were raining as the route can be a little tricky when wet."

You sign in, get fitted with your bike and your helmet and then are given instructions on how the ebike works. Essentially it is always on, gives you a boost when you first start off and then you can press the boost button to help get you up the hills and on flat land. We did this on our last day, just how it worked out and still loved it. To do it at the beginning of the trip would have been great but did not work out that way. It is hard to believe that you travel around 16km in total with about 6 stops including a lunch break to learn some history and interesting facts about Prague. You get to visit the castle grounds and are taken around the courtyards and inside the \"free\" part of St. Vitus and given some background history. We still learned stuff even though we had been on a castle tour a few days earlier. The best part we thought was you get to see a lot of the parks like Letna and Petrin area, something hard to do in a short visit. Would highly recommend to everyone."

The guides were very helpful & gave us lots of tips along the way. Super easy riding the ebike as its mostly just steering. Would definitely recommend."

On arrival we met the two friendly English owners who chatted away with the group and fitted us with our ebikes and helmets. Both were comfortable, new and professional looking. We were then introduced to our two friendly Czech guides who gave a brief instruction of how to use the bikes and off we went with one at the front and one at the back to ensure the small group stayed together through traffic lights. The tour was informative at designated stops but the emphasis was on sight seeing and getting a good lay of the land of Prague which helped us on our second day as to where we wanted to explore more. A nice surprise was the provision of a light lunch of water, cheese roll, chocolate biscuit, cheese and small bread sticks and an apple which was a nice added extra that wasn't expected. The ebikes are brilliant for exploring the cobbled streets of Prague and are not taxing what so ever. Highly recommend."

We both agreed that despite visiting Berlin, Munich, Brussels and Amsterdam, our segway experience with Ebike in Prague was the best part of our trip! Our guide was a young girl who lives in Prague. Her English was perfect, and her knowledge of the history, culture and sites of Prague was astounding. She took all of our pictures, could answer any question we asked about anything, and showed us quirky and fun things about Prague that we would have never known otherwise.The segwaying itself was an amazing way to see the city, as we got so much done in such a short amount of time. We were provided with a complementary picnic, which we ate overlooking some breathtaking views of the city. This is a must-do activity if you visit the city. The value for money is amazing (after talking to other couples who went with other companies we found ours was the cheapest!) A massive thank you for our tour guide for making our trip something really special. It's awful that I can't remember her name- but our tour was on September 8 at 10am."

My husband and I are in our 60's and I am not very fit - but it's so easy. The absolute minimum of effort will get you up any hill!The tour lasted three hours and was, for 90% of the time, on cycle paths. The owners and our guide were very friendly and knowledgeable. From the old town we crossed the river and then \"sailed\" up the hill to make our way through a park from where we had splendid views of the town and the river with it's many beautiful bridges. We stopped at the metronome, the Summer Palace, St Vitus Cathedral as well as various view points and then \"sailed\" up a second hill before making our way down, through orchards to the river, which we cycled along before turning inland and back to the start.The tour lasts three hours, it's great fun and worth every penny. Many thanks."

I enjoy a little more active tour than historical tour plus, I have been wanting to try an ebike (electric), so signed up for a 16.5km tour that took us to Letna Park, Prague Castle and Petrin Park, before returning to Old Town. The website clearly shows the route; it was easy to reserve online, which I did about three weeks before my trip and I did not pay until I arrived for the ride. There was one other couple and myself on the ride; we were given brief instructions on safe riding in Prague and on using the ebike (all that was really needed). We had roomy packs on the back of the bike, with snacks and room for personal items. We also got a bottle of water. Robert was our leader - he shared interesting spots and stories along the way. We had time for photo ops. We had a quick stop at the Summer Palace and St. Vitus Cathedral - enough to see the highlights. Robert pointed out a few more things you don't usually hear about from the guidebooks. He was assisted by Hank, an expat from Cleveland, so we enjoyed exchanging stories about the midwest. It is always a bonus to learn about an expat's experiences in a country. All in all - a very enjoyable tour and experience. I am glad I did it!"

We felt safe on the road and trails as he would let us know what we were going to be doing right before we did it. He also pointed out good tourist spots and non-tourist spots for later in our trip. The ebikes have quite the boost on them! The bikes were so effortless that I had more fun focusing on the scenery. I did find that the standard ebike was a bit big for me. The owner had offered to change the seat for me back in the shop but said it wouldn't be as comfortable as the standard one. Also when going downhill, relying on the brakes was difficult as my hands were a bit too small to comfortably grip the brakes. But that was just a minor problem to me as I didn't feel as if I was in danger. The stops on the tour are phenomenal. A great variety of tourist attractions to peak our interest and definitely a good \"first stop\" of our Prague vacation. Three hours was the perfect amount of time for the tour - including time to eat our delicious complimentary snacks (and grab a beer!)I would recommend this company to anyone who is looking for a relaxing, exciting way to explore Prague. Fantastic customer service from start to finish, knowledgeable guides, and fantastic sights."

When we booked our ebike tour we were initially worried that it was going to be too hot and not at all enjoyable... it was 34 degrees on the day we went. How wrong we were, this was one of the best ways we could have spent that hot sunny morning. The ebikes are fantastic, you peddle and the electric motor kicks in and you glide through the city and even up the steepest of hills with little effort. (Other than when one of us accidentally turned off our electric motor!) Along with the great bikes comes the brilliant staff and tour guides. Having been briefed on the bikes... given our complementary picnic and water we were on our way with our guide to get a great overview and feel for Prague. The cycle route is great and takes in parts of Prague you would struggle to see all of on foot or by public transport. Our guide was knowledgeable and fun and indulged us in stopping and taking pictures at many points throughout the trip. This tour is a great way to spend a fun morning or afternoon whatever the weather. We had a great time thank you."

Was my first time on the Segway and not being a sporty person I found it relatively easy on the straight but did have a 'near miss' coming down a slope (yes, there are a few!) but came away unscathed except perhaps for the ego! The husband on the other hand had his speed jacked up by the tour guide and couldn't be happier!! So if you are a first timer then proceed with caution unless you are a snowboarder/skier etc then you'll feel right at home in no time as BALANCE is required down the slope! eBike - would recommend that you change the FAQ on your website (\"I've never ridden a Segway before, is there any training required?\") - I don't think we got even 5 minutes training? I do commend eBike for only doing private Segway tours (rather than large groups), as during our tour we did see some Segway groups and one lady who came off while trying to 'park' the Segway on a flat surface!"

I also think this would help people that may be reluctant to choose a bike tour due to body ailments or age. Very accessible. The tour has a maximum of 10 riders. Love this!You get two guides which makes sense. One at the front and one at the back. Good if something happens on the tour then one can attend to it whilst the tour moves on. I have never had this on a tour.Our guides were fabulous. They knew so many different things and had a great way of engaging the group.

It looked like we would be the only ones on the tour, but two other groups joined us last minute. So, we had some touring companions from Israel and Canada. As soon as we started out, it began to pour rain. Laura, our \"front guide\" had us stop under a tree and give us a great introduction to Prague while we waited for the rain to stop. The ride was a bit bumpy on the cobblestones. I was a little more timid about riding but our \"back guide\" stayed with me the whole time letting me go at my own pace. The weather turned cold after the rain, so the guides took us on a detour to get warmed up at a great little cafe. The ebikes are a great way to get around with Prague's hills and the guides are very helpful and informative."

            "review": "eBike tour gives you a perspective via distance traveled. I had a great time taking the ebike tour, which is the longest distance-wise of the 3 tours offered by this company. Before I tell you how great it is (5 stars!), let me tell you what it's not: an in-depth history lesson of Prague. You will barely bounce of the surface of history at each stop. So why is this tour so great? Just like life, it's about the journey and distance traveled. You get a great perspective of Prague as you loop around and through the city. The bikes themselves are fun and easy to use, when you pedal the bike (and yes, there is a little pedaling involved), the bike propels itself forward via the electric motor, so every pedal you do is equal to, say, 10 pedals on a normal bike. The cobble stones can make certain sections bumpy and uncomfortable. I recommend standing up on the bike on those sections to protect your bottom. There was a break with a snack in the middle, which was was really nice, as you can sit around and get to know your fellow tourists and form some comraderie. The couple (British, I think?) that owns the tour was super nice, and they had cold water bottles attached to the bikes as we were assigned bike and helmet, this is a well-planned operation (helmets are optional, btw, I took one because it's stupid not to, imho). Helmets were comfortable."

Great for the outdoor type of person who can ride a bike well but also does not want to put too much energy into the journey.

Bets decision we made. The best sites and views would not have been accessible without the added boost e-bikes gave. We are a family of five, our twins are 10 years old, they had no problem with the child size e-bikes available. Mary and Sol run a tight ship, and are not pushy in any way (not always the case with some operators). They think of every small detail including snacks and water for the tour. The length of the tour, time spent at each location and the number of rest stops was all spot-on.Our two tour guides were Czek Nationals (I think Alois and Linda), and both were very knowledgable in the history of Prague (actually they seemed very knowledgable in a wide range of topics). It was good spend time with both. Having two guides, one leading and one following, was reassuring. Much of the tour is on bike paths, but some is on the roads with traffic, both guides were very conscious of road safety.As many have stated, THIS IS UNDOUBTEDLY THE BEST WAY TO SEE PRAGUE!"

It doesn't take long to get used to the bikes, they are very easy to cycle and you can get up to quite a speed with very minimal effort, especially useful up the hills! The tour took us around the city, taking in some spectacular viewpoints. The guides could not have been more helpful. One definite plus was the tour size, the maximum size is 10 which means you feel like an individual rather than one in a crowd. I highly recommend spending 3 hours on this tour, you will see far more of the city than you would on a walking tour and you also get a small picnic thrown in too!"

I've lived in Prague for over 20 years and every time a visitor comes for the first time they want a 'tour', which I'm happy to give them but I've gotten a little bored with fighting the tourists and doing the same Old Town-Charles Bridge-Castle Walk time after time. When our friend's daughter came to stay with us, based on great recommendations from people we know, we decided to take the Ebike Prague Tour and WOW!!!! I cannot recommend it highly enough! First of all, the bikes themselves are so safe and easy to operate I couldn't believe it! We were able to go up hills easily and quickly, it was really great and very simple to control. But the most amazing part was I saw parts of the city from a perspective I've never seen before, learned very cool facts and stories, and completely fell in love with Prague again. Our guide, Jenda, was hilarious and so much fun, but he also really looked after us and made us feel safe. Our guest said it was definitely the best part of her visit and that she felt like a VIP! I'll be sure to recommend this to all of our future visitors (and I'm looking forward to doing it again too for my birthday!). Highly recommended for newcomers and locals alike, THANKS, EBIKES!!!!"

If you want to be able to see the tourist hot spots, and then really see Prague for all it's secret beauties, THIS is the tour for you. We were greeted by the shop owners who were SO kind, and given a low-down on the bikes by our guide Jenda. We were even given free cold water bottles to strap to the bikes for the ride. Our guide Jenda took us to the most fascinating, off-the-beaten path spots, telling us all kinds of neat historic trivia along the way. Arguably the best part: the BIKE. 5 hours on that thing and I swear I barely broke a sweat. The only negative was riding along cobblestone streets, which was a little difficult. If you're a little nervous on bikes like me, wear a pair of gloves; I got a little blister from holding the handles (and brakes!) too hard while going down bumpy cobblestones.That being said, I regret NOTHING. Hands-down, THE best tour experience I've ever had and the highlight of Prague.

From scheduling to arrival to the tour itself, the owners and staff are incredibly welcoming, friendly and gave us a great amount of detail in our overview tour of Prague. The e-bikes themselves are very simply to use and what a treat to fly up hills with ease. Highly recommend and would book with this company again in a heartbeat."

There are beautiful parks and lookouts stretching for kilometres either side of the castle - this tour takes your through these beautiful parks and gardens, as well as through the castle grounds and lesser quarter.The guides are humorous and knowledgable. The packed lunch (if you do the morning tour) is fantastic and the e-bikes make a very hilly ride very easy. Highly recommended to get your bearings, see some beautiful views that you would probably miss and have a great time in the process."

When we arrived everything was done properly and the lady who I spoke to over email was friendly and welcoming and her partner sorted the equipment and bikes out. The tour then began with a small group of 5 and two guides and off we went. I found the guides brilliant, with one a local Czech girl and the other a Catalonian woman who lived in Prague for many years. They were both informative and fun. This tour was the high light of our whole trip. So much so that we talked about it non stop for the final three days we were there. We even enquired about the Segway tour they did as we enjoyed the experience so much. We couldn't recommend this higher enough.A key factor making this to be so good is the two tour guides - we tried another tour who only used one guide and we were unable to see some of the sights up close. Not with e-bike. One guide stayed with the bikes and allowed us to go inside and explore. They were brilliant. If your going to Prague you must must must use these over any other."

We explained to Mary that we would not go on the tour if the weather was poor ie. raining. This wasn't an issue for Mary which was nice. (we understand that by us cancelling, they would lose money so we appreciated this a lot)On arrival, the front desk confirmed our booking, took payment (1000Kcr per person), introduced us to our guides and gave us our bikes. This is a very organised and smoothly run business.The bikes are like new and in perfect condition (better than other companies in Prague). We were given a short demo on how to use the bikes eg. the electric functions. You also get a packed lunch for the trip.The tour itself takes 3 hours and covers some tourist spots like the Castle, the Petrin Tower and a few very nice parks with very nice views of the city. The tour guides were very informative and the tour was not rushed at any time. We had lots of time for breaks to take photos, a tour of the castle, the lennon wall etc.The bikes were great fun and the level of effort (I had a whiskey hangover) was minimal even when going up steep hills. The assistance provided by the battery/motor makes is incredibly easy, almost antigravity like! Tip: do not be put off by the physical effort required to cycle these bikes, they only require you to move your legs!I would highly recommend this company for bike tours in Prague. If you're in Prague for a few days, it's a must do."

My theory is that the number 1's get too popular and do not try as hard as the ones ranked slightly lower (and 1's tend to be more expensive). Ebike was fantastic. I highly recommend them for the service, professionalism, price, and the fact that the tour guide wore a safety helmut just like us. We booked ahead but were very unhappy as a couple of hours prior to our tour it was blowing snow. We wondered how hard it would be to cancel when they called and gave us the option to reschedule which we instantly did for the next day. Our tour guide Alois was funny and informative and flexible on our 3 hour tour zipping around the city. We also stopped at the monastery brewery for a warm soup. A much needed respite during a very cold 3 hours. This is a must-do tour for those traveling to Prague as you get to see further away places than you might see venturing just on foot. Ebike is the way to go...."

The tour itself was fantastic, my partner was a bit hesitant about riding a segway at first but got the hang of it very quickly and now seems keen to ride one again given the opportunity! Lasting for just over 3 hours and covering over 10 miles we were taken from the Ebike office near the Old Town, over the river for stunning views of city from a part you'd otherwise probably never visit, then over towards the Prague Castle. Near Prague Castle we nipped in at the Strahov Monastery Brewery for a break to warm up a bit and get a drink, our tour guide also brought a complimentary packed lunch for us which was quite nice. The ride back towards the Old Town through Petrin Park was probably the highlight for me as it offered such nice views of the city all from the comfort of a segway!

It was two months ago so I can't be sure. They were full of great facts and clearly loved the city. They also recommended restaurants, bars and other attractions to go see. They took the time afterwards to write down addresses and made sure we know where we were going. Lovely people, I felt like I knew them for years. The owners of ebikes were an English couple. They made sure were warm enough with hats, gloves and jackets. I feel like the staff all went the extra mile for us. It was also a very personal tour, with only four of us and two guides. The tour starts about 10 minutes from the old town and is easy to find. It's across the road from the beer museum. Which is actually a pub which offers samples of all the different types of Czech beers. We went in after our tour. The bikes were very easy to use. Very little effort required and I was not tired afterwards. Perfect way to get up those hills."

When we arrived, the owners were very friendly and offered us very useful information and tips for staying in Prague. He also very helpfully suggested I borrow a wind breaker (which I am extremely grateful for as it was freezing that day!). Since we were the only customers that day and we essentially got a private tour of Prague from Laura who was great! You can tell she has a real passion for Prague and we got a real kick out of a trick she showed us at the Prague Castle where you stand at a small amphitheatre and when you speak you hear it echo back at you but only you can hear it.

You will see things that you probably never would find on your own that are far outside the touristy parts of town. Our guide, a very informed and personable young man(Charles?) was just great. He was both knowledgeable and entertaining. He knew a lot of the city history and told it in a very entertaining way. Also, a small picnic snack was included and a nice rest stop for enjoying it.

So easy!!We've choosen eBike, discovered on an ad\u00b4 and enjoyed their professionalism and kindness (they proposed us a hot jacket and gloves).This trip allows us to decide wich site we want to discover deeper in the too coming days.I don't what about the other companies, but I can recommend eBike!!Last point: I think it's better to book your tour one or two days before (not sure but that\u00b4s what I've done by mail)."

I had a most excellent time on the ebike tour and Karel \"Charlie\" was an exceptional guide. Very knowledgeable and great sense of humor. The ride was beautiful. It was my first time on the evoke and it was just awesome. Simple to use and perfect for a leisurely ride around the city. I look forward to returning to Prague with my wife and booking another tour."

The morning was overcast and a little rainy and we got just the two of us on a tour but still we decided to go out and we enjoyed every minute of it. The staff greeted us very nicely and immediately after brief explanation how to drive the electric bicycle, whice was easy to drive and without any physical effort, we went with Karel who is an amazing guide, very nice and very knowledgeable. During the trip he took us to \"Letna park\" ,which is a lovely park, with beautiful autumn trees with almost no people around and where we got also a beautiful panoramic view of Prague. We toured places tourists usually do not come and we managed to see a lot in a short time. The tour was very enjoyable and the guide was great. We strongly recommend Ebike."

From the beginning, Mary was in immediate contact answering any questions about their program and how to find them in the city. Our tour guides were Karel and Linda - both amazing people who took us on a ride around Prague, from Old Town, over the river, through the beer garden, up the hill to Castle, then a provided picnic lunch at an old monastery. Then back down the hill, along the river and back to old town. If you've ever been on a simple bike, these are a piece of cake! The motor provides the extra push when you need it and we easily pedaled up hills and around the city with virtually no physical effort. When we finished, my wife and I felt like Karel and Linda had become our friends. They showed us the city and kept a sense of humor throughout the entire trip. HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT! Worth the money - especially for your first time to Prague."

She loves the city and tailored the sights to what she could tell our group would like (i.e., spent a little more time at the brewery!)

We had 2 great tour guides - Jerda and Andrej - that were knowledgeable and HILARIOUS! They really made the tour for us! The tour started with a quick tutorial and then we were off! The tour went all around Prague and we had some great view points of the city. We went to the castle complex and walked around (no bikes allowed) with one of the tour guides. He took as all around the castle complex. Next we went to an old monestary for a beer (not included) and a pretty good packed lunch with some snacks (included in the price of the tour). After a few more stops it was time to turn in our bikes. I loved this tour, it didnt go as in depth into some of Prague's sights as I may have wanted but it was a great overview to the city to see what I did and didn't want to go back to! Key to this tour for me were the hilarious guides, wonderful service at the home office and the EBIKES!!!!!!"

My partner & I only had three days to explore this beautiful city. Ebike was the answer. I admit that I was reluctant at first because I had not ridden a bicycle for many years. All my anxieties were very quickly dispelled. The machine itself is an absolute delight to ride, one becomes very quickly adapted to it and yet you still get the joy of some physical activity in the fresh air. I found it so much better than being crowded into a tour bus and shuffled from one amazing venue to the next. The staff were very friendly and welcoming. Although we were a small group (only 3 customers) we were still provided with two guides, Karelia & Bert. As I understand it, Karel is a born and bred local and Bert, an American, has been in Prague for a long time. Their knowledge and ability to convey the real heart of Prague was exceptional. The tour took us everywhere we wanted to go, gave us the basis of an extended personal visit to magnificent sites in the following days. We had a chance to see this city from a viewpoint I am sure others missed. The lunch and the venue we enjoyed it at was brilliant. I particularly enjoyed having a beer with Bert.I was particularly impressed with the safety aspect of the tour. Like all European cities I have encountered the traffic was generally erratic. As an Australian I was not used to riding on the \"wrong\" side of the road. Karel led the group and Bert was the \"safety\" man, swinging wide at the rear of the group to ensure no unsuspected car, bus, tram surprised us. Apart from my own inadequacies, I could not have felt safer.Another pleasant surprise is that the company provided us with digital photographs of our journey, a great souvenir.I would say, without hesitation that anyone who goes to Prague and does not take this tour misses out on a great opportunity."

Then you will have this beautiful sunset view while biking, all tourists will be long gone to their dinners; so streets/tourist attractions will be less crowded and you may be the only ones taking the tour-like us :) Just don't leave Prague without this experience.."

They do make biking effortless, but if you want a little exercise, just hit the button and you're on a multispeed city bike. If you want to cruise, you're pedaling just to get going, the bikes take care of the rest. Most importantly, the staff is phenomenal. After an informative and friendly overview by Linda, our guide Karel led us on a fun, super informative and fantastic tour.

We covered all the important spots, and got some amazing views of Prag! The tour even takes you to places that no normal walking tour will reach. You do not visit the \"busy\" areas, such as Charles\u00b4s bridge or the astronomical clock, so you should have a look at them on your own. However, you get shown so many little non-tourist spots, personal favorites of your guide and you learn so much interesting information about the city, that the tour is absolutely worth it!"

I'm not exactly what you'd call a biking enthusiast and to be honest guided tours aren't always my cup of tea either, but my wife really wanted to do it and marriage is all about compromise, right? So I went for it and I am so glad I did. First of all, the Ebikes are super easy to use and really make zipping all over town easy. I was worried that I'd be exhausted by the end of the day but the extra power from these future bikes made things easy. Climbing hills? Easy. Biking for a couple hours straight. No problem. I almost felt like a superhero. Almost. But the bigger thing was the quality of the guides. They really knew their stuff, which I guess all guides do, but more importantly they were fun and personable. The tour flew by and everything felt fun instead of the \"kinda boring but I have to pretend I'm interested\" vibe that some tours can have. We got along so well with our guides that we went out for beers with them after and got to see even more cool parts of Prague that we certainly would've missed. If you're visiting Prague and you've got time for a tour, this is one you'll wanna hit."

Throughout your time in Prague, you will see that Segway tours are everywhere, in the squares etc. These must be avoided as they take you through crowded streets. Ebike however takes you to the nicer spots of Prague which you would not see yourself, especially the \"Central park\" of Prague which provides spectacular views and because this is a mixture of showing you the attractions and the off the beaten track route, you can really get the most out of your segway. We have used the segway before and so were given freedom with it which was great. Our guide was a really nice girl from Barcelona who had fallen in love with Prague and so stayed and her enthusiasm was clear to see. She also provided us with a packed lunch on our trip. The segway is really easy to master, it molds to your body so to speak. This is an excellent tour, do not miss out. Do the 3 hour tour, it goes by quickly and you get to see the really nice parts of Prague"

We also flew past the guys on the Segway tours!Our tour lasted around 3.5 hours with many stops along the way where Yenda and Bert did a great job of explaining the history of Prague and kept us entertained with amusing stories. They were happy to answer any questions we had and at the end of the tour they wrote out the names of places where we might like to try based on our questions and even told us which tram to catch to get there. So basically we saw loads of Prague that we would never have seen on our own, we learnt lots about its history and were looked after by a company who really seem to care about their customers.

The owners were onsite and made sure we had everything we needed to have a great ride. There was only one other couple on the tour and we had two guides so it felt like a private tour of Prauge. Karel was our main guide - his English was great. We really appreciated all the places we stopped and his knowledge and obvious love of Prauge. Lynda our other guide took us through the Cathedral at Prauge Castle and answered lots of questions we had - she also spoke English very well.We were amazed how easy it was to use the ebikes and they made the ride so enjoyable. The short training was all we needed to be on our way. The tour allowed us to get a good idea of where everything was in the city. We especially love the stop overlooking Prauge where we had a packed picnic (which was so good!). When we got back the owners greeted us all by name and let us know that the pictures Lynda took while on the tour would be e-mailed to us (for free) and they arrived later that day. Karel also took the time to mark our map with places to eat and visit based on items we discussed during the tour. This was a highlight of our trip!

They were willing to try to compete but never did and i really don't like the \"market\" way of business.Tour includes short break with nice picnic box."

The bikes are a blast to ride whether you're a novice or experienced rider. The tour is a wonderful way to see the city. Our guides Karel (a local) and Bert (an US expat) were awesome, knowledgeable, patient and funny. We learned about places that we returned to during a subsequent outing. It's clear that this company cares about providing an excellent tour experience and they do just that. Highest recommendation here, one of the top (if not THE top) experiences of our three-week European trip."

It is a small group, about 10 people and you have a guide in the front and one in the back. Our guides were Karel and Bert and they were awesome. They knew so much about Prague, but more importantly, they worked diligently at keeping us safe. Unfortunately, we were half-way through the tour when it started to pour. Karel an Bert worked at keeping us dry and figuring out the next step. They provided us with ponchos and a light snack. They even kept calling Mary to figure out how to adjust the plans/route. Mary runs the place (more like a family business which is absolutely professional) and she was great from the time I booked the tour and all the way to the time when we were running late. She was willing to bike us out to the group so that we wouldn't miss any of the tour. After the rain stopped, we continued the tour. Although we saw less than planned (due to rain), it was still worth it. Even though the rain was obviously not their fault, Mary offered other options to make up for it. All companies should care about their clients as much as E-Bike. We will be back to do the tour again an hopefully it won't rain. Haha!"

But dont fear! This tour is perfect for everyone from keen cyclists to those who haven't been on a bike for years due to the effortlessly easy to use Ebikes. You're not restricted to just the old town as you are on walking tours and yet you still get up close and into the sights which the bus tours can restrict. Undoubtedly the definitive way to see Prague. The guides were everything you would want aswell. Fun and entertaining but full of facts, stories and tips about the city. Eager for questions and going above the call of duty to help out. From start to finish totally awesome! Do not miss out or you will regret it."

As well as the busy parts of Prague like the Castle and the Charles Bridge we got to see some of the less well-known parts like the parks, the riverside and the quieter areas of the lesser quarter. The views of the Charles Bridge and the city skyline with all of the spires were amazing and the \u2018peeing\u2019 fountain is hilarious; the ebike itself is great fun and going up hill on one is an experience not to be missed.

I booked the ebike trip for myself and my friend as we only had a very short time in Prague and wanted to get round quickly and get our bearings. Well what a way to do it. This was perfect. From the booking to the final goodbye I felt well looked after and well informed. The guides we had were great and Phillpe was very passionate and knowledgable about Prague, it's history and how this influenced the history of the wider world too. The ebike was easy to get used to and as others have said makes going up hill a dream. I like the use of the boost button, I felt like I was in some kind of cartoon! As you are getting quite a pace on you get to see lots of the city from high vantage points which on foot you might either miss or would take a while to get there. The tour gives you a taster of what is out there and helps plan the rest of your visit. Lots of unusual things to see on the way too which I will not give a 'spoiler alert' on so you can see for your self. The cobbled streets make some of the biking quite interesting so be prepared to have a little shake rattle and roll but all adds to the fun of it. Perfect way to spend an afternoon."

It turns out our hotel was within minutes of the location which was perfect as we just flew in from NY without sleeping. What a great way to see Prague - riding on a bike that moves on its own...all I had to do was steer. It wakes you up feeling energized!Ebikes require minimum knowledge as long as you know how to ride a bike. During the bike ride, the guides focused a great deal of attention on safety except for a long straight away which gave us the ability to go as fast as we can. The tour took you all around Prague and into Prague Castle which I will let you explore for yourself. Throughout the trip, they take pictures and then email you later on. Both the guides Linda and Charles were pleasant, knowledgeable and great fun to spend an afternoon. At some point, we stopped for a picnic eating yummy Asiago croissants, chocolate and water. You did not earn this meal, but how could you not eat looking out at an amazing view. I would highly recommend EBikes if you want to spend a nice trip traveling through the parks on a bike getting an overview of Prague and taking in the great sites. Afterwards, they will graciously spend time with you going over any questions of where to eat and go to through the remaining part of your holiday."

No sweating, no hard work, or vicious pedaling involved. Therefore I got to sit back and look up a lot more and the views were absolutely breathtaking. The Vlata river could be seen more the 50% of the tour. We stopped at a few points in which the entire Prague could be seen and there was time to ask questions and take pictures. We also got to see the main sight which was lovely. The tour guide was very informative, full of knowledge and very energetic.

The wind blowing through your hair as you effortlessly pedal the street of Prague and surrounding communities. From check in to the return, the staff was awesome. They made sure everyone was comfortable and gave you plenty of time to see the sights and cruise as your own speed. We had a Czech and an American guide, both shared great stories while providing insight to the city. Nice little picnic at a monastery with optional craft beers. All and all a great way to see the sights, get a little exercise and meet new travelers. Tom & Shervin - San DiegoJune 11, 2014"

The team is very friendly and it\u00b4s just great fun to discover Prag by bike. The tour took about 3 hours and both guides gave us a very nice overview about history and culture of this wonderful city. I can highly recommend to take this excursion in your sightseeing program. You will not regret it :-) Thanks to Karel and Albert for this nice experience and also for the personal recommendations for restaurants and bars!"

Our tourguide, Sage, took us along a 17km route with plenty of discussions and explanations of the sights. There was also a nice \"pick-nick\" box packed for everyone in the group that we enjoyed during a stop with a tremendous view of the city. After our tour we got great tips on where to eat (India Palace) and drink (Vinograf) in the local area... but that's not all!

Scenery is wonderful and the back streets they take you on quintessential Prague. The bikes are really easy to use and you don't work up any sweat.!! Such an easy way to see Prague. We did a private tour so just our guide and the two of us. Very handy as his english was perfect, he was very knowledgable and and very good to talk to and find out about Czech life. He also has a genuine love for what he does and we could stop whenever I wanted to take a photo. Mary and Sol the owners, who also speak perfect english, really care about EBIKE and offering a wonderful experience. We give them an excellent rating."

I was able to cover so much more ground in a short period of time than I ever could have on foot or on trams. The tour guide stopped frequently and was very knowledgeable about the history of the city, the landmarks and the various neighborhoods. Prior to my visit I had not appreciated the number of hills in Prague. The Ebike has a small electric motor, which is activated with a small amount of pedaling and made for an extremely easy ride, even on some large hills. A large part of the tour goes through city parks that I would have otherwise not visited and there were a number of stopping points on the tour that were overlooking the city. This was very useful in making plans for the remaining day and a half of my visit. As a result of the Ebike tour, I saw much of Prague that I otherwise would not have seen and returned to some areas of the city that I would not have thought to visit.I highly recommend this tour."

Because of the ebikes you get to go up large hills as easily as pressing a button, which allows you to see the Prague castle and all the other good stuff so quickly.

We stayed in a hostel and were advised by the staff to try Ebike Prague Tours as they said it was a different and original way to see the city! With Prague being such an unfamiliar city to the group, we were surprised that it didn't take us long to find and only had to ask for directions a couple of times! Once we got to the office, the staff were more than welcoming and happy to see us. I have to admit we were all slightly scared to begin with however we had no need to worry as it was easy! All the bikes were in brilliant condition and straightforward to use. After a quick demonstration we started the tour and we couldn't believe how little effort it took to cycle on the Ebikes, even traveling up hills. Our tour guides were excellent and really informative. They seemed to really enjoy taking the tours as much as we did! Half way through the tour we stopped at a place with a wonderful view overlooking the city! Prague has some truly breathtaking views that just could not be seen on a walking tour. During lunch (which was provided for us and was lovely) we chatted with our tour guides and asked them lots of questions about Prague and its culture which they were happy to answer for us. The tour lasted about 3 hours from start to finish and we were sad when it had finished as the time flies by! For anyone wanting a genuinely enjoyable and original tour of Prague city, I would definitely recommend taking a tour with Ebike Prague Tours. It was without a doubt one of the best experiences on my travels and would repeat it again in an instant!"

This is something I really wanted to do but my wife was reluctant, as she had lost her confidence on bikes after two mishaps in the previous months. We arrived early, just to give her a chance to become a little more familiar and comfortable with the tour. Saul, the owner, took the time to provide her with information related both to the use of the bike (some practice time) and the safety of the route and to reassure her that she could move \"at her own pace\". While that pace was quite slow at first, her confidence did increase and I would like to credit the guides with that accomplishment, especially Sage. While both guides were good, Sage was exceptional. The tour covered much of Prague, it was most informative, all of the bikes were in good operating condition, the majority of the route taken was without car traffic \u2013 it was fabulous!"

It seems like a long way but it's really a breeze with the bikes. The guides were knowledgeable and helpful. The highlight was a visit to the Brewery at the Monastery near the castle grounds. My only criticism is that they could have been more informative about the various buildings and historical details.

If you are really interested in the history of prague, and want to learn about its development, its different periods including the second world war and the socialist era, then this is the wrong tour for you. 90% of the tour is spent on the Castle side of the river, you don't visit the Jewish quarter, or learn very much about the architecture and the old town. If you want to have a nice ride, with some nice views and just a little bit of basic info, then decide whether or not you find that worth 37 euros. I am not sure I did."

The two guides, Helena and Bert, took such great care that we were all comfortable and able to enjoy their knowledge of Prague. They had perfect language and people skills. I felt that I learned such a lot, not only about Prague, but about feeling young again! Many thanks!!"

The couple in the office were pleasant and very enthusiastic as they greeted us on our arrival. The e bikes were very easy to use and made it effortless to cycle around the city. We travelled about 16km around the city over three hours, including a little break for our complimentary picnic. We had two excellent guides, one Czech girl and one American guy, and both were fun and informative. They were very approachable. They did not overload us with information but gave us a fantastic perspective of the city. Without doubt the best way to get around the entire city. Would highly recommend it. Fantastic."

Not a mistake!!  Mary was prompt with email responses to our questions, husband and native Scotsman, Solomon who we met at check-in proved friendly and hospitable.  Our guide tandem, Helena and Bert (\"Beauty and the Beast\"), shepherded our diverse age and capability group with care and consideration providing several important tips for safe travel on streets and bike paths. Instructions for use of EBikes was brief but sufficient. All members of our group seemed to easily use the bikes. The bikes negotiated cobblestone surfaces without difficulty. The electric motor smoothly engaged and grade climbs were a breeze. The \"pulsed\" power boost when needed worked as described and generally was a hoot (great fun) to use. The shop location is easy to overlook--as one enters from the street through a corridor into a somewhat untended appearance courtyard. The shop/bikes are located at the rear left corner of the courtyard. Door to the shop may be closed/locked except when preparing for scheduled ride. The provided snack and water was more than sufficient. Overally, my wife and I found the ride as top level fun, a great way to supplement a tourist visit to Praha, appropriate for anyone who can ride a bicycle, and rates as our best single experiece during 12 day vacation in central Europe."

When rocking up to the entrance with a couple of minutes to spare and without booking a space on a tour, we were greeted with a cheery smile and a welcoming demeanour. With two groups both made of 4 people, the ratio of 1 tour guide per group made for a really informative and in depth experience around a whole range of different sites in the city. Bert and Helena took us through the back streets on the electric bikes. None of our group had used ebikes before but will certainly be trying to find other tours as this was a great way to get about. The picnic was a great addition to the tour and certainly not expected.I would definitely tell anyone heading to Prague to get involved in this no matter what the weather or your experience of bike riding. Well done guys. All the best, the Scottish group."

Starting with Mary, who readily changed our reservations from a rainy Friday to a sunny Sunday, to Jenda and Bert, our stalewart guides, who made the tour interesting and enjoyable, to the electronic bikes which made Prague's hills melt away, it was great.Unlike most bike tours, this one actually stops at sights and lets you see them, including St. Vitus Cathedral, to admire the amazing metal doors and the beautiful stained class windows. Bert proved some helpful history and facts in the church while Jenda showed us many hidden treasures and secrets along the way.Also had a nice snack pack lunch and waters provided and some amazing stops and views along the way. Amazing views of the St. Charles Bridge end the trip.Tip: Diouha street is a bit confusing and so make sure you know where the ebike shop is before you get there or you might be late and miss a wonderful ride.

It was sort of a lark to try out the electric bikes, which we had never done and it was another way to get around all those little city streets without having to walk yet another day on cobblestone streets. The bikes are heavier than normal but the motor makes up for it. You start on a low setting and the power only comes on if you are turning the pedals, so you don't get motor assist unless you want it. The handbrakes also cut the motor assist. They had us go to level 2 power when we went up the hill to the castle and you should have seen my normally cautious wife disappear straight up the hill, coattails flying.Intelligent guide, Francesco, spoke good English, from Italy."

It gave us a great overview of the city and we saw things that we never would have taken time to seek out. The guides were very fun and knowledgeable. They even provided a nice little mid-ride snack and time to relax. It doesn't matter what your biking skill is since the bikes do most of the work for you. Really very little effort on your part. Safe, fun and very interesting. This ended up being one of the highlights of our entire 3-week trip. Don't miss it!"

It was the best choice for our flying visit and all their amazing reviews really do stack up.The ebikes are in top condition and they give you really cool helmets too.There are snacks and water provided which is a nice touch.Our small group enjoyed 2 guides who gave us an informative,engaging and at times humorous tour, whilst also allowing plenty of time to really enjoy the bikes.Thanks to all involved for making our short stay in your amazing city so very memorable.Nigel & Anna,Norfolk,UK."

The staff were friendly and knowledgeable. We were asked to arrive 15 minutes before the tour so we were all organised to leave on time. Staff were patient and helpful explaining how the electric bikes worked and about the traffic in Prague. Most of the time we were on bike paths so we were safe. The bikes made the hills really easy. Lunch was provided and we ate together in a beautiful park overlooking Prague. We were shown lots of hidden gems around Prague."

Everything with this tour is great: the e bikes are a great way to cover long distances within the city and at the same time be able to enjoy the views as if you were walking, the guides were friendly and knowledgeable, the path allows stunning views of the city from the heights of the parks near Petrin, and so on! Definitely is worth the money."

From the initial booking to saying goodbye,everything is so very professional yet friendly at the same time. Everybody you meet seems to have been trained in excellent customer care which is worth mentioning as you may come across some very abrupt service in Prague, we certainly have. They also all seemed very happy in their work,always a good sign.The guides,Karel and Hank were the perfect hosts and we enjoyed our whole 3 hours with them.It's \u20ac40 for the trip which is great value,you get a brand new ebike,guiding and a picnic.We opted for the morning tour which starts at 10 so don't go wild at breakfast if you're to enjoy the snacks.The location is very central and easy to find.The route is well thought out and ideal for your first day in Prague,we saw so much in those 3 hours and really wished we'd joined at the beginning of our stay.It wouldn't surprise me if you see these guys popping up elsewhere,good luck with the spread."

I hurt my knee a few days before going to Prague so we switched from a regular bike tour to the ebike tour off the recommendations of tripadvisor. We has SO much fun and it was almost effortless going up the couple hills! They routed us around the perimeter of the city so we saw many sights that we might not otherwise have seen. Our young guide, Linda, was very knowledgeable as well as the other guide that served as safety man at the rear of the group. The instructions given on how to ride this bike were clear and easy to follow. The parks were beautiful as well as the panoramic views. We even had time to stop into St Titus Cathedral in the Prague Castle for a quick look for free! A nice lunch was provided and we ate under the trees and we also stopped for a special treat to pick the Mirabel fruit off the orchard trees we rode past. YUM..definitely recommend doing this on your trip to Prague. It was 3 hours and we enjoyed every minute of it. It was nice to be so effortless yet cover so much \"land\"!"

The Ebikeprague team is outstanding. We booked the night tour (offered during summer months) which started at 6PM. Our guides, Karel and Bert, were incredibly generous with their time and stories. We booked last minute, so we had the added benefit of getting a de-facto private tour. Both had tons of insight, and the personal touch was wonderful and not \"touristy\" at all. Additionally - if you've never ridden an e-bike before, you're in for a treat. We were a bit concerned given the fact that all of old Prague is cobble stone and hilly, but the e-bike does 90% of the work for you while climbing. It's truly a wonderful way to see the city. Do it on your first day to help decide where (and how) you want to spend the remainder of your time in this charming city."

With plenty of opportunity for stopping, hearing about the city, taking photos etc, the tour still kept us moving and we covered a lot of ground. I'm not a 'tour' person but this was informal, friendly and informative and didn't feel like a tour - just a lot of fun. I'm sold on electric bikes now, too.

We had Jenda and Mark as our guides, Jenda being local and Mark from the United States, and they hay many funny and interesting stories to tell us on our way through different parts of the city, including the castle, the metronome, the \"Czech eiffel tower\" (as tall as the paris one, if you count the mountain as well) We also had a nice packed snack box, with water, fruit, chocolate, some nuts and a nice piece of pastry. We really enjoyed the tour, and as it is for a maximum of 10 people each trip its perfect to go around without having to wait long times for people. The bikes were in perfect condition, so were the helmets and all equipment needed. We had a nice break for our snacks on a mountain overlooking the city, from were we could see the TV tower as well, known for being the 2nd ugliest building in the world. Overall a great experience, recommended for everyone as long as you can ride a bike :) Will repeat if xominf back to Prague!"

You will experience fantastic views (from Letna and Petrin hill), try something new and you will receive crash course in history and some good tips for the city. The three hour length was just enough and you will receive a little snack along the way. I drove an ebike for the first time in my life and I found it perfect for going around the city. Even though I have lived in Prague for most of my life I have discovered several things I didn\u2019t know before. I would especially like to thank my tour guide Sage for a wonderful time."

The tour takes in a number of hills and these were absolutely no effort. Our host was eager to please ensuring all were right with the bikes. Our tour guides were informative and very pleasant. They provided us with a few extra bits of information along the way rather than just the scripted blurb. Many of the site we stopped at we visited again in later days. If you have only a little time in Prague this is a good way to see a lot in a short time. If like us you have a few days you will surely discover what you want to come back to."

My friend invited me to go on the Ebike Prague tour with her. I thought it would be fun and decided to join. The tour route gives you a really great overview of the city. My personal advice is to do this tour as one of your first activities in Prague as you will see great views of the city and also go to the top highlights of the city including Prague castle. Our tour guides were extremely knowledgeable of the city including its architecture, culture, and history. The bike was a lot of fun too! I'm not sure why I haven't had an electric motor on my bike all this time... All in all, two thumbs way up! Enjoy your visit!"

It was a fantastic tour of Prague and gave us a great overview of the layout of the city and its history. Having Linda and Brent as guides was wonderful given their in-depth knowledge and great personalities. It was a fun time and very informative. They also provided a nice lunch for our tour. It was the first time either of us were ever on an e-bike and I tell you it is the way to go. Don't know if I will ever take another bike tour without the electric part. Gave you that extra boost to get up hills and was easy to use. You still pedal your bike but not nearly as much or as hard. It is definitely easier for the older crowd (that's only what I heard, not telling where I fit in). Overall this was a wonderful tour and the owners and their staff were very welcoming hosts. This company and tour is another reason why we liked Prague so much."

There were many age groups in our tour and everyone was able to enjoy it, from a 16 year-old to a 65 year-old. This is possible because of how easy it is to learn how to control the ebike, and how well it propels you up the hills for truly amazing views. The guides are amazing and committed to helping you have a good time and learn what interests you. Since the groups are small and there are two guides, its really easy to get in-depth knowledge of the city and what else to do until the end of your stay. I really enjoyed the views, the explanations, and the fun time riding a different kind of bike up and down the hills of Prague!"

You can peddle as much as you want but the assistance of the motor is great on those Prague hills. Ian was a great tour guide (sorry I forgot the name of the second guide). He is quite knowledgeable about the history of the Czech Republic and was able to answer all of my questions. We were able to see a number of sites in a short amount of time. Walking that route without a guide would have taken a whole day or more! The ride concludes with the opportunity to bomb down a huge hill. It was a great climax, they really should highlight that more in the advertisements. I highly recommend this tour!"

The guides,Jenda and Sage were wonderful,very safety conscious and informative enough without cutting in to the whole ebike experience. How to describe the bikes?

We appreciated the added safety of a guide at the rear of the pack. They provide a snack which was a nice diversion as we stopped in a park and sat on the ground to eat like we saw so many locals do. Our group had 8 people, all from the US, but from many different places. So it was nice to meet and chat with others. All in all, a great experience. So much so that we came later in our stay and did the whole thing over by ourselves. Thinking about buying one of these for myself--much easier to explore the hills of Tennessee!"

We're staying round the corner and were recommended it by a fellow guest. We had the most wonderful time,the ebikes are so easy to use and really make you smile. No effort involved,even on those hills so we finished feeling totally fit and ready for our busy party evening ahead. Highly recommended to everyone visiting Prague especially if you're not a fan of stuffy tour buses."

I really enjoyed this tour,actually a lot more than I thought I would.It was extremely hot and I was wondering whether or not to go ahead, afterall 3 hours on a bike in intense heat is not really my idea of fun.Anyway,I could not have been more wrong, ebikes (as I discovered) aren't bikes at all,I mean they look like bikes and you still pedal but its so ridiculously easy that they probably deserve recognition in their own right).There were 2 excellent guides-Linda and Bert-snacks and extra water (provided free of charge) and the magnificence of a most beautiful city making this an experience I'll certainly remember.Like other reviewers,I so WANT an ebike,they're the biz."

The bikes were great, safe and effortless....I want one! The communication from home was great from Mary and she knew it was our 20th anniversary and gave us a bottle of fizz at the end - so nice..I'm so glad we did this and chose ebikes and the guides were brilliant, and helped you in anyway about the history, where to go to see a \"different\" prague away from the crowds and also gave advice on places to eat etc... Nice idea to stop for a picnic which was provided.Will be recommending to all my friends. Thanks soooo much for helping make our day so special."

The electric boost is a little disconcerting at first but quickly becomes brilliant fun heading up to the castle and beyond. Lovely guide -(with great voice projection!) had us all safely through the few trafficked roads and around to some lovely vantage points overlooking Prague. Lots of fascinating stories shared on a 3 hour tour with picnic included. Serendipitously the best walking tour guide in Prague (Marcus of \"The Naked Tour Guide\") just happened to be coming along on our ride, and so we topped off our visit with some lovely garrulous rambles on foot! Combine E Bikes with The Naked Tour Guide for some Prague loveliness you definitely wont regret."

It was, and the other big bonus was the smaller crowds around the attractions we visited. Our two guides (Jenda & Sage) looked after us extremely well, and were particularly kind in getting my daughter used to these weird but wonderful bikes. They took us on a well planned tour with interesting information; it was great to get out of the old town (which is easy to see on foot) and see more of this beautiful city from some amazing viewpoints. Ebikes beat Segways any day of the week, you travel further, quicker, in comfort...and you don't look like a berk! We were out for three hours plus (Jenda & Sage are not clock watchers) and we went at our own pace. The bikes were surprisingly comfortable and easy to handle, 90% of the ride is on dedicated cycle paths (not cobbles) which really helps.Ebikes are a completely professional outfit, everything was first class from the safety instruction and helmet fitting before we went out (all completed in their time and before your 3 hour trip starts), to the picnic snacks provided, their brand new equipment, the speedy email responses prior to our trip...and their guides are amongst the best I have come across in any city.We were on a tight budget and this trip did account for a chunk of our holiday spends but after we completed the tour we both felt it was great value for money and the highlight of our 4 day stay."

The bikes take a couple of minutes to get used to...when the battery assist kicks in it catched you by surprise the first couple of times, but everyone in our group adapted in minutes.The tour itself was primarily around the perimeter of the city...not through the Old City. Theis was great for us since we did a walking tour of the Old City. The guide was good. Shared some interesting facts about the city and its history. Could have been a bit more torough in his explanations and depth compared to other similar tours.The tour isnt cheap...about $50US, but I felt that it was worth it, particularly given the topography of Prague."

It'd let us cover a lot of area in a short amount of time. Biking is always fun and e-bikes addressed the knee problems that one of us had in that biking was effortless. As an added benefit, we met Ian and Allie, our two guides on this tour, who were just absolutely wonderful. They were fun, friendly, very accommodating of our slowish pace and most importantly, very knowledgeable about the places we visited, the history, the architecture, etc. We learnt a great deal during this tour and are very glad we did this. We highly recommend this tour."

Ebike Prague Tours was professional, organized, clear, and most importantly, fun! Our experience was nothing short of great. Instructions just to get to the location was detailed, clear, and concise. The tour guides were knowledgeable, informative, and flexible (not to mention, great photographers!). We got to see and learn so much about the city in just a few hours. And the ebikes... maximum distance with least amount of exertion. Need I say more?!Once you go Ebike, how can you possibly go back to anything but?!"

Ebikes Prague provided the perfect one, despite me being the only person that day - I had two tour guides Ian (the Czech) and Bert (the Yank). Both were incredibly passionate about their city and it felt like I was travelling with friends rather than guides! The day was bordering on rain so I was provided with a poncho which fortunately I didn't have to use. The bikes were so easy to use, pedal away and off goes the engine, it just zipped up those hills with complete ease and no stress on the legs. I had previously done the 6 hour walking tour the day prior and this gave me another perspective with extra and different information. The PERFECT MUST DO in Prague. It was one of the best things I did on my trip. I would highly recommend it!!!!! Susi, Perth, Australia."

Another person in our group joined us about halfway through and she was just as impressed as I was. Taking the e-bike tour, we saw sights that few others got to see. The bikes were in excellent repair and the lunch break was delightful. All in all, this was one great highlight of my trip. Barb Collins"

The tour guides were excellent very knowledgable and friendly. The owner of the ebike place was also such a cool guy and super friendly.

It was a great way to see lots of Prague's history and included good explanations for us. Well worth the money and would definitely recommend this tour.

I have to say, it's a strange and funny feeling on these bike as it literally rides for you, which is awesome as you can cover more distance in less time. We saw some beautiful sights of Prague and the wealth of knowledge our tour guides Ian and bert had was fantastic!! They were laid back enough that we felt at ease but professional enough to know we were getting an A grade service. I recommend you do this on one of the first couple of days you are there as it gives you a great overview of the whole city..

They were absolutely brilliant to work with and made our time in Prague that much more amazing. The owner was easy to work with and communicated very thoroughly via email regarding location, what to bring, and what to expect. When we arrived, we found out we were getting a private tour that day (guess the rain scared everyone else off\u2026better for us!). Our tour guides were literally some of the friendliest people we have ever met. They knew all sorts of interesting history about the city and chose very cool and fascinating places to stop and visit. They even packed us a little snacky lunch to enjoy while overlooking a perfect view of the city. We had two tour guides so one could lead and one could hang in the back to ensure everyone remained safe. A lady getting out of her car almost opened her door into me while we were going by, but the rear guide saw it coming and his warning shouts prevented an accident. The bikes themselves are ridiculous amounts of cool. They have a motor that senses your pedal motions and pretty much does all the work for you. It takes a second to get used to and can feel like the bike is running away from you at first, but it is very easy to adjust to and then you feel like superman going up those hills and not exerting an ounce of effort. Riding them over cobblestones is quite the bootie-massaging experience. All in all, I would highly recommend these guys. We began our time in Prague with them and their expertise allowed us to tailor the rest of our trip to further exploring the things we were most interested in. Everyone we met while working with Ebike was so nice and genuine and we left feeling like we had made four new friends. We even bumped into the owners while walking around Prague the next day and they were still just as nice! These guys are legit and I would absolutely recommend this tour as a must do to anyone and everyone visiting Prague."

We had a v.g. time despite the rain and I would recommend this company especially if you have children as safety standards are very high. Prices are competitive and lower than some companies. The bikes (having compared) are far superior to other tour groups. Had an email from the owners later apologising for the weather (hardly their fault) and offering us a free tour next time. We only missed the last half hour so this was most generous. All round wonderful service and a great way to see Prague!"

They showed so much enthusiasm right from the get go - even though we were the only two on the tour! We opted for the twilight tour which was stunning! The tour lasted was three hours, we cycled on electronic bikes (which made it real easy) thorough all little off streets and hidden quirks! No way would we have discovered such areas without this tour! We stopped on this hill overlooking the city whilst we enjoyed a lovely provided snack then continued on the last leg of the tour. We were able to stop whenever we wanted to snap up some pics and ask as many questions without feeling discouraged. The two guides that took us we highly driven on our safety and making sure that we enjoyed every minute as the three hours goes so fast!

The bikes were great, especially for those hills around the castle and fairly easy to learn to ride.Doing the tour on the first day in Prague was great as we were shown many places and things in a short time (3 hrs) and then knew what we wanted to return to and spend more time at.Simon also had lots of interesting information that you don't read in the guide books.A snack box and water are included which fit into your storage box attached to the bike. Because I had a medium size camera, lens and warm jacket as well, it wouldn't fit, so Matt took a backpack and carried mine. Rain jackets were provided and used on the day we went, though luckily not much rain. We were able to leave excess gear at the office.Very friendly and would definitely recommend."

They zip along effortlessly, wherever you go. Our tour was tailor-made for the eBikes and was the perfect amount of time. A laid back, educational and super fun experience. We covered a lot of ground and went to places and saw things regular walking or bus tours can't access. The guides had fun, interesting stories and told us all about Prague's rich history, without droning on and becoming boring.Refeshing picnic at the perfect place, perched high above the city! Amazing views everywhere.I could easily go on, DON'T MISS THIS ONE!!Great value, you won't be disappointed."

I booked in for ebike Prague tour in Sept'12 at the end of my few weeks in Prague / Czech Republic as my holiday and conference buddies had left. It has to be one of the best tourist activities I've done in my 30 years of travelling. Even though after a few weeks we had done lots of activities in and around Prague - this tour still took me places I hadn't seen or experienced. The staff are all brilliant - helpful, fun, knowledgable, pleasant, etc.They provide a lunch and water so you just need to bring a camera! I'm a cyclist but had never been on an ebike before ... now I'm a fan.....but you don't need to be a regular cyclist to do this tour - the stored power is great for getting you up the inclines/hills. I wished they had a full day version at the time - I just could have kept going .. but I had a plane home to Sydney to catch! Big thanks to the ebike team for the experience!"

Ebike Prague Tours is the way to see Prague, You got the feeling that you were seeing all the main attractions along with some places that only the locals get to see. The technology of these electric bikes were amazing going up hill, you really just sat there and it would take you straight up a hill without any effort. Our tour guide Ted was extremely funny and had some great history to share with us along the way. Why I really liked seeing Prague on bike, was that there is so much to see in Prague and it takes to long on foot, and cars and buses are not allowed in most of these areas so this was the perfect way to see Prague for me. I highly recommend this tour! A big Aloha to Ebike Prague Tours ! Chris from Honolulu Hawaii"

Although I'm a keen cyclist, my wife isn't and was a little nervous, but that was totally unfounded. The tour itself was very interesting and the knowledge of the guys just added to it.

Ebike Prague Tours is one of the BEST experience that my girlfriends and I have had on vacation and was definitely our favorite experience in Prague, hands down! From the beginning, Mary was amazing to work with for booking the tour, was very responsive to emails and text messages and was so sweet to give us detailed walking and bus directions from our hotel to their site. When we got there in the morning, we were greeted by their staff who fit us to our bikes and helmets and got us ready for the ultimate EBIKE experience. We walked the entire city the day before and let me tell you, it's a lot of walking. To hop on an EBIKE that basically does all the work for you, you're able to see and cover the city in minimal time, and fly through the city...literally! The EBIKE experience itself was great, but I have to say that what made the tour so amazing was our guide Burt. He was such a good storyteller in giving us the history of the points of interest that we visited without dragging information on (you all know what I'm talking about!) and had such an ease and love for the city that truly shows. They are super nice and patient so bikers of all levels need not be afraid. Burt even went the extra mile by offering to take photos for our group at each point of interest (we're a group of girls so this was a major plus!). This tour is seriously awesome. It covers all the major areas that you want to visit (and then some!) and the people that run the company really give you an intimate experience where you feel like you're amongst friends. Best tour ever and we would definitely do it again. We are on the third country of our Europe trek and we're still talking about it."

We were undecided whether to do this tour due to rainy conditions but when we turned up for our booking Sol was very welcoming, yet we didn't feel pressure from him to honour the booking. But being short on time and wanting to do this on our first day for an overview of the city, we were leaning towards doing it. However Sol had a windcheater that I could borrow as well as gloves for myself and my husband - it was that that sealed the deal! So off we went with Bert and I have to admit the rain got worse before it got better but to be honest it added to the adventure - and also the greenery! The great thing about the bike tour is that you can cover vast distances in no time and you almost feel like you're in the countryside. I didn't realise that Prague has so many parks and it was wonderful to be out in the fresh air whilst listening to Bert's passionate and well-informed tour. When we went through more crowded areas you just give the bell a good workout! The water and the snacks were an added bonus in the lockable box and the fact that you can leave anything at the bike shop was really helpful so if you have long coats or a backpack they can stay there. The bikes themselves were comfortable, in great condition and simple to use. I turned mine off a few times on the flat and it was nice to have that cycling feel but I must add you don't have to be at all fit to use the electric bikes. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this to anyone - it was a great experience with great people and I wish Sol and his team all the best for a successful Summer."

We have taken bike tours in several cities, and those were much more informative than this. Don't get me wrong, there was a lot of stopping and explaining, but I would have enjoyed more of that. Otherwise, everything was perfect. All of the personnel were really nice and spoke \"American\" English, so communication was terrific. The length of the tour was just right at about 3 hours."

Their number 1 priority was safety which is reassuring when you are travelling!! we did this as a family outing and it was a fantastic activity for all of the different ages including teenagers! Even in the cold winter it was a great way to see the sites of Prague. I recommend to do it at the start of your stay to get your bearings in this amazing city."

As you ride along the opposite shore to the city centre, you get wonderful views of it! and it's easier to orientate yourself and to choose what do you prefer to visit afterwards! 100% advisable!"

They are a breeze to use and great fun, especially in a city like Prague where the many hills might discourage a conventional bike tour. You can cover a lot of ground, and the tour guides are friendly and relaxed about making sure guests have enough time to see the sites. The worst part of the tour is having to turn the bikes in -- once you've ridden one, you don't want to give it up!"

My ebike tour delivered beyond expectation and was the highlight of the trip. The 3 hour tour was spectacular - late in the season by general traveller timing, the autumn colours and views were magnificent. The guides were highly professional in every way, safety conscious, personable and nothing was too much trouble. Their knowledge was astounding with fascinating tales and anecdotes from beginning to end. A fabulous entree to explore Prague further. The tours flexibly cater for all ability levels. Within minutes of my first time ebike experience I was ready to take to tackle the hills - what a delight to find I'd to pedal no harder than on a straight. I will most definitely be back again, has whet my appetite for more more more..."

Generally when I visit a new city also if I don\u2019t have so much time, I avoid guided tours, I find them boring and expectable, but in this case I decided to try Ebike tours because I love bikes and I\u2019d never tried an e-bike before. Now I really want to recommend it because it\u2019s a perfect way to experience a city having fun and discovering places that in another way it would be difficult to find out or to reach because far from the centre. I enjoyed the view from the Metronomo, the picnic in Petrini park, the strange echo in the Castle, but above all I had fun climbing hills without any effort\u2026ok I swear I\u2019m not so lazy! I\u2019m also a sport girl but sometimes it\u2019s great to forget everything and just experience what is around you, moreover the two guides were very careful about our safety, so I didn\u2019t need to think also about that! They were vey informative and funny, they told us some strange stories and curious details that I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll never find in a guidebook! At the end of the tour they also gave us some useful information about good Czech restaurants and typical pubs (thank you, I really enjoyed one of them)So I\u2019m not used to recommend guided tours but this is an exception and if I come back to Prague (I hope) I will do it again for sure.SabrinaItaly"

Not sure where to start our short stay, we decided to try the Ebike tour to maximise our time. The first thing that struck was the professionalism of the team at Ebike, and their passion for Prague...a passion that did not wane on our tour. Our guides were fantastic, providing just the right level of information about the city's history, took us to visit interesting sculptures and sights, even suggesting places to visit later that day so we could squeeze as much out of our visit as possible. We saw things we would never have discovered on our own. The Ebikes were so unbelievably fun (I want one!), and were comfortable to ride for the duration. We took several bike tours in Europe, and I can tell you not all bikes are this well maintained or comfortable! I felt very safe as a result of the instruction provided before we set off and the two guides - one at the front and one at the back - who were on hand whenever we had a question. We saw more in 2 hours than we would have in 2 days on foot in a city we had not visited before. I will never forget flying down a hill through an orchard, it was exhilarating! There are several stops on the tour to take a break, hear some history, have a snack and take some photos, several of which our helpful guide took for us (and his photography skills far exceeded mine, so double hooray).Love love love this tour and recommend it to anyone."

(http://www.ebikeprague.com)There were many brochures and many tours. I am so happy I saw their brochure and made the connection. Mary helped me select a tour time and gave me precise directions from my hotel to their place. Solomon was there when I arrived, and shortly after my two guides, Ted and Burt, make their appearances. We had coffee and chatted. It was nice.After we got to know each other, I signed the standard disclaimer and paid the money, and when the time for the tour arrived we left the office with our e-bikes. In addition to a helmet, the guys provided me with an ear(s) band and warm comfortable gloves (not to mention keys to my bike's compartment with my picnic lunch and drink). I was the only one on the tour, a tour that could have included up to nine others, so I was very lucky. I don't think they would have had warm gloves and ear bands for 10 people. It was late November, and without the extra \"warmth-gear\", the tour would not have been as pleasant and fun as it was!I had a fantastic time! They guys gave me a short but complete intro to e-bike operations and we were off. The three hour tour was over in a blink of an eye, it seemed, thanks to the company's choice of the tour route, the professionalism, competence and friendliness of my guides, Ted and Burt, and the beauty of the areas of Prague we toured. I was pretty tired of climbing stairs after a couple of weeks in Turkey and given the terrain of Prague, I couldn't have experienced what I did on this e-bike tour, on any of the other tours available, bus or walking tours. Riding the e-bikes gave me the freedom to climb the hills, get off the beaten paths, get into and through some beautiful parks, and get to other out of the way places in a unique and physically easy manner.I cannot recommend this experience enough if you are in Prague now (fall 2012) or are planning a trip here. Bonus: the guys also gave me a few specific suggestions of places to go on my own later, based on what they learned about my interests during the tour.I tipped them. They deserved it!- Tim - Solo Traveler - Saskatchewan"

They also packed us a nice lunch/ snack which we enjoyed at a lovely city viewpoint. They shared the city's amazing history and also had some fun personal stories.

It is possible to leave stuff in the shop while you're out on the ride. They also provide you with a snack & water for a stop during the tour. It was easy & fun to ride up the hills without any effort. The ride was very professional with Bert following in the back & warning of any possible dangers (car coming up behind us).

It was great to travel to the various hilly parks to get panoramic views of the city. Our guides made the whole experience fun, comfortable and informative.

Two guides went with us and they were knowledgeable and fun and very safety-minded, making sure we all were together and safe as we crossed some major roads. I absolutely LOVED the ebike!

We had looked at the Segway tours but realised that they didn't really go any further than we had walked. The E-Bike Tour went through all the major parks, crossed and followed the river and went up to a number of the hilly vantage points overlooking the city. The bikes were easy to use. A thorough briefing and time spent getting set-up with the brand new bikes, comfy saddles and helmets was followed by the opportunity to try the 'e' bit of the bike in a quiet street where we could get used to it. A very strange feeling initially, the e-bike is a joy to behold. As you begin to pedal an electric motor takes over and powers the back wheel. You'll find yourself effortlessly whizzing up hills and down roads putting no more effort in then if you were sitting on a sofa moving you knees up and down! Once accustomed Ted and Mary; our two tour guides, took us on a really informative trip around the city. Happy just to let us ride around enjoying the bikes they took time to understand our interests and tailor what they focused on and told us. Time flew by and as we realised we were a bit hungry, lo and behold they had provided a health snack and some water in our bike box. With all the friendly chat, and time they had taken to answer all our questions we realised we were running behind schedule. A quick dash back into town, a recommendation for a night out, a restaurant and another 3 things for our 'to do' list and we really couldn't have found a better way to spend a morning exploring.Exceptional value, learned huge amounts and was great fun. Would recommend to anyone (and I really mean anyone whatever your fitness level) who wants to have a bit of fun exploring the city."

I have average fitness and can be very absent-minded, so was worried I'd fall off or get hit or something but it was no problem at all - I never even felt scared, even when we were on the old cobblestones. You cover a huge amount of ground and see Prague from all of its (extraordinarily beautiful) angles, our guide was very knowledgeable, the electric bike was way easier to use than I thought, and we could easily go up and down a lot of hills that we couldn't have walked (we went in September and it was really hot). Other benefits - we ended up being the only two people on the tour (personal tour for a group tour price!), our guide sent us a link to all the photos of us that he took within about 30 minutes (before we even got back to our hotel!), and it feels really safe (you get a helmet, a saddle bag, and water).

The bikes are really great as you can relax and let the motorised bike do all the work. I hadn't cycled much before, and never on a road, so was a bit nervous but didn't need to worry at all. Michael, our guide, was great (there was just two of us on the tour so we got great value!), he was very knowledgeable (and patient!) and was happy to stay longer at certain sights and take our photos. Totally recommend this as a way to see Prague - I felt so happy afterwards."

Modern bikes with electric motors, even a booster switch for going up the occasional hill. Nickolas was a great guide. There were 4 of us on our tour and we covered many of the main Prague highlights with plenty of photo stops. In summer, its best to go in the morning (10am departure) as there's not as many people on the streets."

We had a small group , stopping often for pictures and for our knowledgeable tour guide to point out historical places and points of interest . Our last bike stop was at the castle, giving us a brief overview and whetting our appetite for a return visit. Although the bikes were powered , we would add that some athleticism and balance is required . Some streets can be narrow and heavily congested . Overall we were very satisfied with the tour and the vast overview of the city that we took in."

There were only 6 of us so it was easy to stop, ask questions and we learned quite a bit about Prague in the process. The bikes are very easy to use and you rarely have to pedal; definitely not a workout if that is what you are seeking. The town is hilly therefore this type of tour is very easy for the topography. There are segways everywhere and it was nice to cover more ground with this type of tour. Anyone who can sit on a bicycle seat can do this tour. I particularly loved the stops at the Kafka museum to see the scandalous sculpture in the front as well as the John Lennon Peace Wall. Our guide was very patient as we stopped many times for photos. This is a great tour and highly recommended."

This e-Bike tour was perhaps the highlight of our entire European trip this time. Prague is quite a hilly city and therefore difficult to cover in a single walking tour. It was our first time on e-Bikes but they are easy to get used to and make it seem like riding on a \"flat Prague\". As well as seeing all the places of interest along the river, you also get the view from the highest point without much effort at all. Our guide, Christian, was VERY knowledgeable, spoke extremely good English and gave us more than the allotted time for no extra charge - as there was no tour booked for the afternoon. I would highly recommend this tour as the ideal introduction to Prague. Very good value for money. We intend to do it again next time!"

Whereas our previous experience was not a guided tour this one was and Petra our guide was great. Seven of us were treated by Petra to an informative tour of Pragues best known attractions and a few lesser ones as well! The E-bikes were a breeze to ride with just the right amount of effort required to feel like you have had some exercise but without the strain particularly when climbing hills. It was an absolute pleasure riding around Prague for what was surprisingly 15 kilometres. The tour starting and finishing point is the E-Bike shop which well located not far from the Charles bridge. I thoroughly recommend you start your visit to Prague with E-Bike you will love it."

The ebikes are very easy to get the hang of, even for a those of us in our late 60's, and almost effortless to power. Our guide Petra was friendly, informative and safety conscious. No problems even with some heavy traffic and wet cobblestones. After the tour we ducked out of the drizzle into the Restorance and Steak Kamparium, a cozy little cellar restaurant just down the street from the bike shop, for lunch and beer - excellent!"

We had 5 participating in our tour (4 of us and one other) and 2 tour guides (the second was training). Both guides were very friendly and knowledgable about their city.

You will laugh, learn and have a great time, just as we did. Since returning to the UK I have noticed that there are other tours with ebikes available. However, we used 'Prague by E-Bike' and would thoroughly recommend this tour company.

Our guide, Nicolas, was wonderful. Although the day was hot, we did not even break a sweat on our e-bikes (I am an avid cyclist, I wish going up hill was always as easy as today!). A few things stood out: the guide was excellent, the bikes were well maintained and very easy to use, the service was exceptional (including providing us with helmets and bottles of water), the small group was just perfect, and the pace was spot on. Prague by e-bike primarily takes less than 6 people per tour. Our tour only had 4. Because we were a small group we were able to spend more time at some spots, and less time at others. The pace was driven by us. Although we did not go into any of the sites, we did get a great feel for the layout of the city, and now have a more refined idea of what we want to see more in depth."

The bike was more powerful than mine and the ride was great. You see a lot more than a walking tour - cover a much bigger area and get to more places, especially high vantage points overlooking the city. You can still easily stop at points of interest and Prague is very bike friendly, so we were able to ride on special bike paths, through parks, pedestrian areas etc. only dismounting in the castle grounds. I was very pleased that we visited the Lennon wall. All round a great way to become familiar with the city, key places and overall layout. Thanks!"

He took us on a wonderful visit of the city and enabled us to not only view the breathtaking sights but to learn about the tremendous history of this place. MIchal was extremely knowledgeable and made our tour absolutely perfect.The next couple of days we were in Prague we were able to go back and spend time visiting several of the places he pointed out to us while on our Prague by E-Bike tour. Had we not taken this tour which I call seeing Prague \"up close and personal\", we would have missed out on so much.

My wife had been having hip problems and was afraid that she could not do very much walking when we got to Prague. But she said that riding the bike was very easy & comfortable. The E-bikes are very easy to use - you start pedaling and the motor switches on very smoothly. You make about a half a turn of the pedal and then you seem to \"coast\" for a few hundred feet. The bike has 7 gears which we rarely used. Twice, Michal warned us to shift down to first gear before going up a steep hill. We had to pedal constantly going up the steep hill, but it was like pedaling a normal bike on a level surface.The start location was easy to get to on the #9 Tram. This was one of the high points of our visit to Prague. Thanks, Michal!"

I recommend doing this tour your first day so you can decide where to go back and spend your time."

Our Prague by E-Bike tour was one of the highlights of our month long trip in Europe!We were lucky enough to be the only two people booked on that afternoon's tour, so we effectively had a private guide. Michal was very informative in terms of the history of the city, and it was really interesting to have the perspective of a native Praguer in regards to our questions about contemporary Prague as well. At first I was hesistant, as I am not a regular or confident cyclist, but my fears were totally unfounded - it was very easy to ride the e-bike, with basically no physical effort required! You just coast along and press the 'zoom' button if you need a bit more oomph! Experienced guides and quality helmets are provided, and you are lead along a very safe route, with little interaction with road traffic at all. In addition to the fun of riding the e-bikes, the interesting tour of Prague sites and commentary from Michal, another added bonus was the photographs he took of us throughout the tour, which he promptly emailed to us, completely free of charge (we took several day trips and tours throughout our holiday in Europe, and many companies tried to charge as much as US$5 + per image!). I am really glad we chose to take the Prague by E-bike tour, especially over one of the many Segway tours available in Prague - we saw huge mobs of people in these groups who could not possibly have been receiving the one-on-one guidance that we received, and who would have been unable to cover the amount of ground that we did on the E-bikes. I highly recommend the Prague by E-bike Tour, you will not be disappointed!"

It is so fun and effortless that you can't help, but have a good time. Miroslav Vojtek was our guide today. He had the knowledge of a university professor. We were on a 3 hour tour and every stop we made he provided the most detailed information you can imagine. In the tour I feel as though I learned the entire history of Prague and saw every important building and part of the city. If there is a better way to see Prague please tell me about it. If you have a chance to go you would be foolish not to take this tour."

Because of cobblestones, hills and no designated bike lanes (like in Berlin), there are few regular bikes in Prague. The electric bikes let us cruise uphill effortlessly and cover much territory. We crossed the river twice and saw many of the major attractions. Michal was polite and always patient with us stopping to take photos. We would recommend Prague by E-Bike to all visitors.

The bikes make it so easy to get around and see more in 3 hours that you ever could by walking. I was lucky and was there when it was not too crowded but I could see that it might be hard to bike all the places we went if there were more people. I would HIGHLY recommend taking this tour to get a great history and overview of Prague. Michal the guide was professional, knowledgeable, and made sure everything went smoothly. The bikes are so easy to use! This is a great way to enjoy being outside, going places where the cars cannot, but not having to work that hard :)Thanks for a great tour!"

It was our first electric bike experience, so we can't compare with other e-bike tours, but we absolutely loved it. The bikes made cycling up the steep hills as simple as cycling along a flat piece of road. Electric bikes are a little heavy, so some of the shorter members of the group struggled with mounting/dismounting at times, but our guide was there to help and only travelled as fast as the slowest member of the group. The route was a mix of small narrow street, hills, parks and long flat stretches where you could really flex and enjoy the bikes' full power and speed.Our guide, Miroslav, was excellent - friendly, courteous, and helpful. He only moved on from stops when we were happy to, and was happy to answer questions about Prague's history and culture. This was truly the highlight of our time in Prague.The only thing I would say is if possible try and scope out where the bike office is beforehand so that you don't get lost on the morning of your ride."

Without much time to see such a dynamic city, not much in the way of pre-planned activities, and achy feet from all our walking, we caught a glimpse of a flyer for an E-bike tour. Best investment of our two weeks in Europe. Three hours of riding through the main attractions on both sides of the river, up and down hills and to some of the best vantage points in the City, it was well worth the money. Our finicky teens thought it was fantastic. We invested in a private tour for the four of us. Miroslav was extremely well versed in the history of the country, spoke wonderful English, and enjoyed the trip as much as we did. The E-bike concept is terrific.

Our guide, Michal, was very accommodating and knowledgeable. He gave us really cool insights about the different historical landmarks around Prague. The E-Bikes were very easy to use, and made the tour very easy, even when going up steep hills. The route was also well planned, with limited exposure to traffic and gorgeous views throughout the tour. Highly recommended for anyone visiting Prague."

My son, grand daughter and I just returned from a visit to Prague, without question our favorite activity was touring Prague with a wonderful guide from PRAGUE BY E-BIKE. This was our first experience on E-bikes and I can't say enough good things about them. We started off on our three hour tour with our guide Martin giving us a quick lesson on the E-bikes. The three of us, ages 10, 48 and 71 were equally comfortable on the bikes. Martin, a native of Prague was a wealth of information about places to see and the history of different areas. We were able to go many places where cars couldn't go including some parks and the famous castle, stopping several places for photos. After we finished our tour Martin recommended a wonderful place to go for a delicious Czech meal."

Taking a tour via e-bike seemed like just the thing. The bike does most of the work, yet we were able to still feel like we were biking through the city like real cyclists. The tour guide, Andrew, spoke English very well and knew the city and history as he was from Prague. Booking was simple and flexible. We booked the 10AM tour and it was raining. I emailed requesting a later tour time and immediately received a response from Jan that it was no problem. When my mother and I got back to the hotel, she realized she forgot her wallet in the bike bag. I emailed the company while my mother called. Jan dropped everything to go to the office and check the bike. He found her wallet and then even biked to the hotel to deliver it. Great, honest company. I would highly recommend this for anyone old and young. It was worth it."

Not only did we had a lot of fun riding around the city, but also we learned a lot about Prague from our tour guide, Michal. He was kind, helpful (especially, when I had difficulty getting on the bike because I'm 5'1) and also very knowledgeable. The bikes were absolutely amazing - it had a boost button that you can press when you're going uphill and it will take you uphill with ease. I highly recommend this tour if you're only in Prague for a couple of days and you don't have the time to walk all over the city."

On our first day in Prague we went straight to the Old Town Square and it didn't take 5 minutes before we were approached by someone offering a segway tour. And then someone else from a different company and so on and so on. Within 30minutes we had 5-6 different leaflets in our hands.We had a look at them and were quite surprised by the prices offered by the different companies for the EXACT same tour. The options were 1h/1h30/2h.EuroSegway wasn't the cheapest at all.. BUT they were the ones that seemed to have more groups going around and their guides had a very good English. Funny enough we hadn't been approached by them. So we enquired one of their reps and told them that we had had a cheaper offer (which was true) and he straight away matched it. he then tooks us to the office were the segways are parked. After signing the contract we were introduced to Alex, our guide. Put our helmets on and straight away he explained the safety procedures and we had a test drive (as it was our 1st time on a segway). We did not start the tour untill we were comfortable on them and Alex was more than patient while he explained it to us over and over. The teaching time did NOT count for the 2 hour tour. We then set off and went for the tour... it couldn't have been any more perfect. Alex gave very clear instructions when to turn/stop/go/slow down and always keeping an eye on us. The segway becomes really easy to control as we go along... He stopped to explained the sights, to take pictures when we asked for them and even stopped and helped us when we needed an interpreter to go in a pharmacy for a cream and in a shop to buy gloves (and stopped from getting a rip-off from the shop owner). Never rushed us and answer every question we had...At the end of the tour Alex gave us list of recomended restaurants and even pointed them out on the map... he just couldn't do enough for us. The tour itself is fantastic and we got to see all the top sights Prague has to offer. It's a very different way to see the city and its just gorgeous. Its a MUST DO when in Prague!!! We definitely recommend this tour and this company!!"

We decided not to visit the places with a lot of tourists, but instead visited two parks and stopped for a drink.I really enjoyed relaxing in a quiet atmosphere, with a lot of space to ride the Segway.Stanley is really relaxed and a down to earth guy. Definitely worth it!"

Should have more than 4 hours to explore the whole city with Stefi. The car is easy to control. Colourful helmet with a wide range of size. The whole trip was exciting but really safe. She also recommend the most famous ice cream shop in Prague. Best experience we have ever had. Billy"

A great way to see a lot of Prague (and the ideal way to get up the hill to the castle) in a short time, and Jeffrey made it a fun tour but imparted a lot of information along the way (and tips on where to visit in Prague).

The tour price was very reasonable and they also put a GoPro on one of our helmets so we could record all the memories :) Would highly recommend the tour!"

Even our wifes and friends who didn't take the tour regret it when they saw us return with a tremendour smile as small kids with a new toy.

I think they take up to about 20 people per group but there was only me and my and my boyfriend so it felt like a personal tour. We were guided around by Sergey, he was really friendly and stopped at different locations to tell us about the history, didn't overload us with information, just told us the interesting things. I didn't think I'd be able to balance to begin with but something just clicked after I started. Really good value and they give you a helmet, there are so many segways speeding round the centre by the many pedestrians - didn't see any other groups ith helmets. Definitely recommend Euro Segways!"

I can't drive or even ride a bike...However, I have to say this was without doubt one of the best experiences of my life. After fitting our crash helmets, and a brief training session at the offices, we were off...Our guide, Kireille, was very patient and informative. The Segways were very stable and it wasn't long before I was fast on the heels of my friends, whizzing through the streets of Prague Old Town. The actual tour was interesting and covered everything necessary, without being too long or boring. We had booked the 1.5 hour tour and I feel this was about right. We were able to get a good idea of the various tourist attractions, which we then visited in depth the following day, on foot. The long road up to The Castle was a little daunting but with Kireilles help we all made it and I even managed to wave to the other tourists we passed on the way. If you are considering this activity, I would definitely recommend it. If I can do it, anyone can!"

Seemed like a nice guy, he had just bought his coffee and donut in the morning and gave it to a homeless dude, quite impressive. So he convinced us to do the tour, and and since we were anyway considering it, we said yes. Next day we land up for the tour, very excited and our guide Oleg (OG) asked us if we wanted a historical tour or just a random segway ride. Obviously we wanted the historical tour. Well, it was far from historical. He did not know a thing about the city, monuments or history, and in fact we, being tourists, knew more about the city than he did. We asked him questions, which he could not answer, so he decided to WIKIPEDIA and give us answers which were not good enough. We got fooled into this. We did enjoy the Segway ride, but that's about it. So much for the 'historical' segway tour. NOT RECOMMENDED. I would say go with a different company, we ran into some others on segway tours and their guides were interesting and knowledgeable."

I've been to Prague 4 times before and had seen most of the places before multiple times, so I booked the 1-hour trip mostly for the benefit of my friends I was showing Prague to. And I am so glad I did! We had a wonderful time, a company of four, and everyone enjoyed every minute of it. I think we were lucky to do the evening tour and enjoyed spectacular sunset views over the river, as well as the lights of the city. Seeing Prague on a Segway added another dimension to the experience and I would definitely do it again next time I go.

He let us practise for about 15 minutes in the back street before we headed out with him into the town. I asked if he could take a few photos for us and he was so obliging. He carried my camera with him and took loads of great pictures for us. The tour itself was also interesting as he took us through the Old Town Square then we headed out along the river bank where we managed to get up a bit of speed then on to the Charles university where we were lucky enough to catch a Red Bull Promotion. Kirill really made the experience a fun one and the girls in the office were also fantastic and nothing was too much trouble for any of the team.

Went on the segway tour today with my friend, we got taken out my damian who was extremely fun to be around and told us so much about the city! He was friendly and very happy, always happy to help, my friend fell of her segway so he took her all along the route, damian let us stop and look around the palace. Very reasonable price and SO worth the money!! Would definately come back and do it all again, thank you again to damian again for being a brilliant tour guide! Highly recommended"

We really enjoyed it- if you don't want to commit to a full 2/3hr segway tour of prague this is a good way of trying them out without getting ripped off (better than going with the people hanging around on old town square)."

A great way to get a feel for the city and to find the places to explore at our leisure later in our trip. Our guide Constantine gave us time to get used to the Segway and led us at our pace through the city and over the river. A lovely guy, superb English and an obvious passion for the city. We would have no hesitation in recommending Euro Segway."

Friendly and informative we discovered lots of great things about the landmarks and sights and had some interesting chats about politics too. Its a great way to see a lot of sights in Prague in a short time. Its worth remembering that Segways must irritate some locals sometimes so we tried to remember road sense and courtesy. We had a rainy, cold day which made us concerned but we did not need to be. We were given rain capes, a must! The instruction is useful and the Segway is easy to use. If it's cold its important to dress warmly and wear gloves because your hands are exposed. Do it its lot of fun and really made our short trip."

Ren\u00e9's commentary was original and well informed. Wrap up warm if you're there at this time of year, as the previous reviewer advised!The main drawback for us was that we called ahead to say we'd arrive ten minutes late for our booking and then had to wait for almost an hour before the tour began. To make matters worse, the coordinators didn't tell us this, so instead of going odd for a coffee and coming back we ended up simply waiting in the street (and the cold). This was disappointing and cost us valuable time."

Great experience, but if you're going in the cold weather do make sure that you wrap up warm as you're basically standing completely still in the cold for an hour or more, with the extra wind chill factor of the segway whizzing along. I'd suggest at least a wooly hat under your helmet and two pairs of gloves!Usually you'd be sent out with just your party and a tour guide but myself and my partner were buddied up with a french couple. This did mean that the tour took over the booked hour as the guide had to say everything in french and english, but I didn't really mind this, we got a discounted group rate and it meant more time on the segways.The guy that we booked with was really helpful and the booking process was really easy. With a lot of these things the people selling you the tours can be really pushy but Adam wasn't like this at all, he just gave me his number so I could book later over whatsapp when we found a convenient time.The segways themselves were great fun and very easy to control, literally feel like you have more manoeuvrability than walking by the time you've got used to them."

However, Nastay was an excellent instructor and in no time I had the hang of it and was ready for the tour. There were four of us in our tour and Nastya was very patient with us as we stopped to look at the sights and take pictures. She even offered to take pictures for us so we could all four be in the same picture. We saw things we would have missed had we walked on our own. She share many very intersting facts about Prague and its history. We had a wonderful time. I would highly recommend this tour. We took the 90 minute tour, but I could have ridden the segway all day.

We did a two hour tour which took us through the city and into the parkland in the Lesser City overlooking Prague Castle. Just fabulous. The segway was easy to manage even over uneven terrain and gave me the feeling of just gliding along. Our trip went to the miniature Tour Eiffel atop the park where we enjoyed coffee and cake before descending and returning to the segway office. We chose to start early so that there were no pedestrians around but by the time of our return the streets were alive but no trouble for us experienced segway riders. Would do it again in a heart beat."

It gave us a good overview of the city, including some quirky details like the John Lennon wall. However I would have liked to learn a bit more about the history of Prague, but I guess that's something to get from guide books etc. it's also quite expensive, but not more so than other Segway tours.

It was definitely more of a guided Segway experience round the city than a tour to learn stuff. you get some training to begin with but they will then expect you to be able to go up slopes, downhill, up small steps etc. Without actually having that training and having only practiced on a flat road."

However among English he also speaks Spanish and French so he can provide for a variety of people! Rene tailored the tour to suit our needs- if we needed to stop for a drink or loo break he would, and asked us what in particular we would like to see/ tour around which was lovely as the tour felt personal and friendly.Not only did he give us interesting information about the city,he also gave us noteworthy advice that four young girls wouldn't have even considered beforehand, so thank you Rene! The experience with Rene felt very professional and well-run, yet at the same time was very relaxed and personal, allowing for a lot of laughter and fun!A great added bonus was the chance to have pictures taken of us whilst touring Prague beside interesting landmarks, which Rene made look fantastic.Thank you Rene for making Prague a memorable experience!"

We enjoyed our stay very much, thanks to Ren\u00e9 who guided us around and showed us the most stunning sights and views... Because he was so ethousiastic we were too! Thanks for everything Ren\u00e9, you are the best....Maybe we'll see you again in Barcelona... You never know. Greetings, Linda and Marcel"

Our tour guide, Alex, a student in International Relations, led us on a terrific Segway tour up and down the Castle Hill, through the Jewish quarter, through the old city and the new city and through the huge city park that overlooks the city. It's great way to get a sense of the place and you can stop anywhere you want to go in or look around. We had so much fun on the Segways we kept moving most of the time, though we stopped for a great beer and snack at the monastery atop the hill. Alex knew enough about all the major landmarks to make the trip informative and fun for all of us (two adults, two teenagers). The three hours flew by. And all of us now want our own Segways."

I think a let down for them was they seemed quite unorganised and they didn't easily comprehend what we wanted initially - and you'd expect these tourist focused businesses to have great English comprehension, but I do have to say the segway ride was the highlight of my trip to Prague."

Fortunately on the last day we had some downtime and so decided to see the city on a Segway and what a good decision that was! Our guide was Renee, he spoke very good English and was obviously both knowledgeable and enthusiastic about his adopted city. We were entertained by many anecdotes, some funny some quite dark but all were fascinating. I would highly recommend this company and if you've any doubts about your ability to safely use a Segway be assured that if I can do it anyone can!! Our experience was further enhanced by Renee taking plenty of photos and video which he forwarded onto us after the tour at no extra cost. At the end of the tour I was surprised how quickly the time passed, how much I'd learnt (including useful tips for the future) and how much I'd like to try a Segway out again. 10 out of 10. One tip, don't be afraid to negotiate a good rate particularly if you're in a group."

We loved this tour, but please do note that this is really a sightseeing tour, where you will see the majority of Prague very quickly and get to go places you wouldn't normally go if you were walking, such as up high in the hills. You will get some great photos also. If you want detailed history of the places you visit, I would suggest finding another way to get around.

We went to the castle and then around town, seeing places that we wouldn't have done otherwise, like the Lennon wall and the hanging Freud. Our guide was very good and nice."

We booked a tour with this company because they seemed that they know what they are doing and their segways looked a bit better than those from another companies. When we got to the meeting point our guide showed us how it works and we were good 2 go. But what had upset me was the fact that all the guides from this company AREN\u00b4T CZECHS. They are russians or ukraines or something like that. And that just pissed me off. We are foreigneirs in this city so we had expected that our guides will be czechs but they weren\u00b4t.Besides this fact our questions had been left unanswered and we also had to make our own photo stops and the guide didn\u00b4t tell us something more. He was like wikipedia just full of things you can read somewhere.Definetly not good worth for the money!!"

The ride is only about 22 miles, mostly flat with a couple short hills. The guide was easy-going, informative and capable, and we were delighted to learn that it is simple to bicycle out of town into the countryside. We rode one way and took the train back, something we've often done on our own while bicycling in the Czech Republic--but if you haven't, this is a great way to learn how to do it. It really opens up opportunities for self-guided bicycling, especially when you get used to using Czech cycling maps. We recommend Praha Bikes trips for the occasional cyclist as well as more dedicated riders who want to join a group or just get used to riding out of Prague."

The tour was LONG especially with so many of the streets being stone. We seemed to do a lot of back and forth whereas if it was just one tour we could have done it in a more streamlined way (like doing one end of the city then the other). If I were to go again I would just do the morning tour and then do the John Lennon Wall and any other sights I feel I missed later. Our tour guide Francesco was great. He was so knowledgeable so I don't want that to be taken away. I just think for the 7 of us we think the tour could have been a little shorter if it was done in a different order.

Our guide, Britton, was extremely friendly and he did a great job of mixing in history with humor. The bikes were what I expected for a rental bike (think \"heavy and industrial strength\") and the staff at the shop were courteous. If you opt for the all-in-one \"7 hour\" tour, please keep in mind that it's two separate tours and you're only actually moving on the bicycle for less than an hour for each portion of the tour. (I had auto-pause enabled on the GPS)... All things considered, I would definitely use this group again. I was seriously considering doing another tour the very next day, but opted to check out a local farmer's marker instead & explore the city by foot."

Also, if you are uncomfortable riding a bike in heavy traffic or around cars and pedestrians, this tour may not be for you. This tour is a fine survey of Prague. We recommend it highly."

Praha bikes suggested that we rent bikes and do the trip ourselves (about 30 miles) and take the train back.. The trip was magical, beautiful scenery, bike trail was safe... BUT..there are hills (evoke helped a lot), we got lost several times and had to ask locals who don't speak English because the bike trail is not continuous (you have to go through towns) ... If you get lost make sure you ask the locals about \"bike\" trail not car directions to karlstein...and there was poor signage ... We made it but list quite bit of the figuring out our way... You take the train back just make sure they describe to you how to buy tickets. Have google maps so that you can ride from main train station back to Praha bike shop. Although they clise st 7:30 they waited for us till 7:45 but we didn't know they would do it so we're a bit stressed out to get back before they close (they should have mentioned that to us)..we tried to call but none was picking up the phone for hours !! :) anyway, before you rent the bikes on your own, make sure you iron out these details w them ..beautiful bike ride through czeck country! I will do it again now that I know how it works! Good luck :)"

Physically the tour was not challenging as it was on the flat so anyone worrying about being on a bike for 3 hours need not worry - there was also frequent breaks to look at the areas in more detail. Would recommend to anyone to get a better feeling and knowledge of the beautiful and historic city of Prague."

We knew Andrew was going to be a great guide when we saw that he was wearing a Toronto Blue Jays cap! As we live 2 hours from Toronto, we found lots to talk about when we weren't learning about Prague. Andrew really knows his new home and told us so many interesting things. We particularly enjoyed the morning up on the hill and touring the castle. At lunch we returned to the bike office and he took us to a great restaurant where the locals hang out. My husband was thrilled with the food as it was traditional Czech fare. We both had a beer and a big plate of food, enough to keep us going for the afternoon tour. The afternoon was very hot and we got a bit weary which is the only reason I didn't rate the tour a 5. Andrew was great, taught us lots, showed us places to return to but we were fading from the heat! I would definitely recommend these tours when visiting Prague!"

This tour will give you most of the sights so you can return at a later time. Lovely coffee stop in an open park as well.

Our guide was always keeping an eye out for group and criss crossed us through Prague to numerous sights, some interesting history on Mozart, Charles bridge, WW2 etc interspersed with funny stories and able to ask any questions from best place for Czech beer to must see exhibitions to where to eat like the locals. Tour took 2- 2.5 hours and was nice leisurely pace, One point to note is that it is very busy and you cut on and off pavements a number of times, we all had bells though and no real issues. Recommend it."

More importantly, when the bike I rented broke down when I was at the top of a very steep hill, they sent one of their technicians out to basically rescue me asap. I wanted to give a very special shout out to Britton, who literally ride a replacement bike up the entire way, swapped the bike with me, and took the broken bike all the way back down the hill and via the metro back to the shop. And he never complained or showed any anxiety about the trip at all. What a stud. I very much appreciated him and the service he provided. So I was happy all around."

Being able to experience a different (more local) side of Prague and enjoy a few beers along the way was very enjoyable. At no point did Andrew make us feel rushed, he was only concerned that we had a good time. Usually when we do these tours we prefer that we get a guide that is local to the city just for that added sense of authenticity, however it was refreshing to finally get a guide that is not local who did not annoy us. Thanks for the great day :)"

The headsets are a game changer for bike tours because you hear quick comments about buildings, etc that are nice to know, but not really worthy of stopping the whole group of bikes.Praha Bikes and their good team of tour guides will keep you safe, smiling, and motivated to explore more of the city. I highly recommend this tour early in your trip because you will learn things that will make you want to explore more.I am glad to be the 700th person to give them the highest rating that Trip Advisor allows.

Our guide was friendly and knowledgeable, but since we were usually in the back of the pack we missed out on much of what he pointed out. The write up said a headset would be provided but was not. The bikes were good but not great. Several of us had issues with gears slipping. The guide mentioned that they were the last bikes because the best ones were rented for long hall trips. Mine had some larger problems and I was offered a partial refund. I expected to enter the castle but we arrived too late, not Praha's fault, but maybe should be better stated on the website that it isn't a sure thing.

It was over 90 degrees the day we biked and I was very worried that it would be too much but with the E bikes there was absolutely nothing to worry about!

It was a short ride out of Prague (approximately 10 minutes) and was a little difficult do to traffic and cobblestone street especially if you are not use to riding in city. Once out of the city center after reaching the Vlatava river the ride was very pleasant, mostly flat and minimal traffic. We made several stops along the way for beer and lunch. When reaching Karljstejn there is a 15 minute hike up a very steep hill. The castle is impressive and the view was wonderful. No one in our group toured the inside of castle. The bike tour is mostly about the ride in the countryside and not the castle. We then had about a 5 minute ride to the train station and tickets were included which was handled by our guide. You are responsible for getting your bicycle on and off the train and through the train station. After reaching Prague about 6:00 PM there is a 10 minute ride back to Praha bike. I would recommend this tour if you have extra days in Prague. I would say the bike ride level is moderate if you are not a cyclists."

First off Andre was the man and the best tour guide one could ask for giving your history, social and cultural stories of Prague and it's people I never knew of. Additionally you don't realize how much more ground you cover on bike. I'd say it would take almost two days on foot what we covered in 3 hours.Also the tour guide gives his own opinion on beer gardens, restaurants and sights that should be hit and the ones you should pass up on if you don't have time. It's great to get the orientation of the city before hand.Oh yeah by the way it's a blast! Thanks Andre!!"

As fascinating as Prague is, it was a break to get out of the city and away from the throngs. We arrived a Karlstejn mid afternoon, after the tour buses had left - perfect timing. The tour follows the rivers for the most part, so you see some water birds, pheasants and to the delight of my daughter, some baby goats. Karlstejn is Karlsejn. I'll leave that to another review. As with most guided tours the key is the guide. Michael gave us just enough history and local color and we were with him long enough to get to know him a little, to compare life in the Czech republic and our home country. A great day all round.Booking via web and follow up by email was easy."

It started in Old Town Prague and wound through the countryside along the Vltava and Berounka rivers. The tour took a total of about 8 hours and was relatively flat most of the way. We were tempted to ride the 35km back to Prague but a thunderstorm at Karltejn castle made us opt for the train ride back instead. Jirka was a great guide. Fun to be with and knowledgeable about the country and scenery. We stopped several times for breaks along the way and had a great lunch in a village about a mile from the castle. We discussed with Jirka the option to ride straight from Prague to the castle with no stops, which he was willing to accommodate, but we opted for the couple of stops. All in all, a great experience. We would do it again. Actually, we\u2019re considering doing an extended tour next time we are in Prague (e.g. maybe Prague/Dresden, or Prague/Vienna).

The ride took several hours but our wonderful guide Britt knew just where and when to stop for food, pivo, and relaxation. Britt was knowledgeable about the places we passed through and set a steady but fair pace. Bonus points to him for being able to herd the 15 of us all 25 miles of the ride without losing anyone. I highly recommend him and this company!"

My boyfriend and I only had one full day to truly explore the city of Prague and this bike tour did an excellent job on hitting the main attractions that we wanted to see during our time here. Our tour guide (Sienna) was amazing and very informational. She even took the time to answer our questions about the city in general, and gave us recommendations on what food to eat and places to see/eat outside of the tour. This tour also allowed us to know which areas we wanted to explore after the tour was finished."

Our 2 1/2 hr. city tour was great, our guide was Francesco -- very good English, great sense of humor. We saw some highlights. The second tour was to Karlstein Castle, about 22 miles from Prague. Beautiful bike ride up the Vlata River from center of Old Town, then up tributary to the castle. Very informative and scenic. Tip not solicited, but appreciated. Mikael accompanied as an extra guide for the second ride, he was great also. Highly recommend."

We highly recommend this tour as it gave us a perfect overview of the city in a short 2-2.5hr. If we were to walk it all, it would take way too long to get the same overview (and we are pretty fast walkers). It's been a couple days since our bike tour, and we are constantly recognizing/referencing all the places we had been to on our bike tour. Of course, we have to give this credit to our guide, Migel (sp?). He not only told us about the history of the city and country but also gave us info we needed during and after the tour, which helped us to become familiarized with the city quickly. We left from Praha Bike Shop (just a few minutes walk from Old Town Square) and crossed the Vltava River via Hlavkuv Bridge (we think) to end up at Letenske Park. Then we went onto Prague Castle complex and by Strahov Monastery and down to Mala Strana and Kampa Island. We crossed the river back and ended at National Theatre. Then we went by Vaclavske Square and then Old Town Square and back to Praha Bike Shop. It was really an awesome way to spend our first morning in Prague. The pace was great as Michael allowed plenty of time to stop for pictures and helped take many family pictures for us. We did it on regular bikes and enjoyed it (except for just the one hill - some of us got off and walked the bike up because we had forgotten how to change gear fast enough ... we are not avid bicyclists and only ride about once a year when we are on our big vacation as we like doing bike tour of the cities we visit). Anyway, there is also the e-bike option which would make it a whole lot less exercising."

Sasha was a great tour guide -- very engaging, had lots of great stories, answered all our questions and did a great job of keeping track of everyone in the group. Prague has a lot of cobblestone streets, but the mountain bike they gave me was well-maintained and had no problem handling all the bumps. The old parts of Prague are obviously not designed for bikes, but the route we took kept us out of the traffic and I always felt safe riding there. There were people on my tour from China, Columbia, Canada and the U.S., and it was nice talking with everyone. It was also surprisingly affordable (but Prague is like that)."

We booked the day before, but they were still able to make it work on short-notice and despite the fact that we were the only ones booked on the the long day tour.Our guide was Jirka and, along for the ride, were two new guides who were intoduced as \"trainees\" for this tour, Britton and Ond\u0159ej. All three were excellent guides, with Jirka and Ond\u0159ej being locals and Britton being an American expat, it was fun to chat about the comparisons between everyday Czech and American life. Jirka's stories personal experiences of being a young child under Communism and Ond\u0159ej's family stories from World War II and Communism were absolutely fascinating.The bikes were in excellent condition. However, at one point, my bike developed an annoying click/grind in the bottom bracket (probably just some dirt in the bearings). Being a regular bicycle rider, this was really a non-issue for me. Regardless, noticing this sound almost immediately, Ond\u0159ej was quick to attempt to repair the issue and, when unable, insisted that I swap bikes with him. The trip continued without incident. We made two stops on the way to the castle...one for beers and the next for lunch. Both were enjoyable, inexpensive, and provided plenty of opportunity to chat. We made it to Karlstejn Castle and spent some time taking a look around the castle and village. While we chose not to take a tour of the inside, it is certainly an option. We enjoyed walking around the outside and our guides took us out a back exit that took us through some nice wooded trails back to the main road. From there, we took the train back into Praha. At that point in the day, it was a welcome sight-seeing trip home for people with tired legs.While walking around the village Jirka and Ond\u0159ej talked about one of the items sold at the trinket shops. I believe they called \"luck\"...basically an inexpensive grab bag with some unrelated old items that you purchase without knowing what is inside. My wife and I didn't purchase anything at the village but, since we had purchased lunch for them, our guides presented each of us with a bag of \"luck\" when we got back to the shop. It was such a thoughtful and kind gesture from a group of really fun guys.All in all, we had a wonderful day trip with Praha Bike. The long ride is as-advertised: mostly flat and on bike trails for most of the trip. The guides were attentive, fun, and happy to answer questions or just chat. We would happily do another ride with them on our next visit to Praha."

The shop is centrally located, set back in a peaceful setting where you are certain to receive a warm welcome from the front desk. I went on both the Classic City Tour and the tour to Karlstejn Castle and recommend both very highly. The bikes rode like a dream, and our tour guide was kind enough to help us with our seat position and understand the way they worked. Britton was our tour guide for both tours and his wealth of knowledge, sense of humor and love of the city made him a winning tour guide. If you want to get out of the city, the Karlstejn Castle is an absolutely beautiful ride. I\u2019ll never forget the views I saw that day. If you want to fall in love with Prague and gain a deep respect for the Czech people, take the Classic City Tour. I\u2019m sure every other tour they have is fantastic as well, and if I ever get a chance to go back to Prague, I will absolutely return to Praha Bike."

The staff was super friendly and provided water, gloves, and rain ponchos (the weather wasn't great that day). Our guide, Yana, was very friendly and knowledgable about the city and surrounding areas. It was still a bit chilly, so about halfway through the trip, we stopped for tea and strudel in a small-town pub to warm up. The trip there through the countryside was great and Yana continued to check that the speed was ok and that everything was fine while we were biking. Once we made it to the castle, we had a relaxing lunch and a good time just chatting. We saw a lot, biked a lot, never felt rushed, and really enjoyed this trip!

Francesco was a wonderful and super knowledgeable guide and made sure my three girls (youngest is 10) were safe and wearing their helmets. Highly recommend....."

Our guide was extremely friendly and showed us some exciting places which I would probably not have covered otherwise. He also had some great facts for us and was able to keep us engaged in the tour. The controversial \"art\" designs of David Cerny were probably the most memorable ones. We did take a drinks break which helped breaking the ice within the group. Our guide even brought markers so that we could leave a \"mark\" on the famous Lennon wall in Prague. It's a good trip to take especially if you're traveling solo and the weather is kind."

Thanks again Sasha-you were great (other than when you showed me up by jumping straight on to David Cerny's babies!)"

Our guide Sacha was engaging and well informed and spoke excellent English.We took in the sights with his background knowledge to let us know a brief history of what we where looking at and some of the legends and folklore of Prague itself. The tour is at a relaxed enough pace for any nervous cyclist to keep up and we fortunately chose to do the basic city tour on a Sunday which meant less traffic was about.If I had more time I would have considered doing the castle tour as well.Strongly Recommneded"

Tour started with an overall map demo and some boring safety instructions. Jirka is a Prague born local who has inside knowledge and history of every attractions in Prague. He has never shown any hesitation to stop and enjoy panoramic views or to take photos where ever we wanted. We have cycled along the river and enjoyed the magnificent views of the city from Letanska Sady, Prague Metronome and Belvedere gardens. Jirka also shared some interesting facts about every buildings visible. Prague Castle, Presidential residence and St. Vitus Cathedral are must do while you are in Prague. Change of guard at 12:00 noon is another interesting custom to see in Prague. Please note you won't be allowed to cycle within Castle compound and you will have to park the bike outside.Our tour continued through Cerninsky Palace, John Lennon wall, Kempa Park, Crawling Babies and lot of breathtakingly beautiful green areas and interesting cobblestone streets. We stopped for coffee and cake in a restaurant (Ml\u0177nska) before we cross the river for busy city traffic and lot of lost tourists. Prague city is very cyclist friendly and vehicles do adhere to make way for cyclists. We cycled the city with fun and joy. We have managed to see all major tourist attractions including Old Town Square, Wenceslas Square and Charles Bridge.Cycling tour with Praha Bikes especially with Jirka was a great way to start our holiday and we have learned a lot about the places to re-visit for rest of our stay in Prague. We were pleased to have chosen to start our holiday with cycling. When we returned to the base, staff warmly welcomed us and gave us some tips for rest of the holiday."

Once we got going we found the ride on the city tour route to be well planned (we manage to avoid the large crowds of tourists) and relaxed (good pace, not a lot of road riding with traffic). Aside from being able to cover a lot more ground that on foot, the best part was that Francesco helped us understand the significance and gave meaning to all the major sites that we visited.

Since this was a late day / early evening tour, we needed bike lights to see (sort of) and to be seen (as necessity).

The route took us up to Prague castle and the ride wasn't too bad up the hill on a regular bike. I think the people with the electric bikes found it more difficult than we did. This was a perfect way to see the city and a perfect time to do it with the sun setting and the buildings lit up."

We had Sasha as our guide for a night time tour around Prague on Segway. Sasha was great, very friendly, knowledgeable and accommodating. Since there were only 2 of us, Sasha was able to tailor and guide us to historical sites which we had not visited during the previous days.If you have not experienced Segway, I would highly recommend it to all as it is easy and a really fun way to see any city. If you are visiting in fall/winter, bring gloves and wrap up!"

He's from Slovakia but lives in The Republic and is extremely knowledgeable. I've done many tours before - some better than others - but the tour with Sasha was great. He didn't bore us with tons and tons of crazy details that we wouldn't remember. He knew just the items to cover in a memorable way to help us learn all about Prague. We did the panorama tour and you see great views of Prague, some of which would be hard to get to without a bike, but be ready for the hills! Thanks Sasha!

We didn't know the place or any good routes so we were counting on the employees to help us out.Luckily we were greeted by one of the nicest and most helpful person, who explained everything to us in great detail, gave us a huge map and drew 2 possible routes for us to travel, with spots we should look out for (e.g. stairs, bridges, bad roads etc..).My wife is 5ft tall and I'm 6\"5' with back problems. The fellas in Praha Bike fitted us with 2 bicycles which were exactly what we needed! We rode for at least 4 hours and had a blast. The big map served us well. The weather and views were incredible and the bikes were in excellent shapes, fast and not making any noises. You can easily tell they get good treatment by the folks at Praha Bikes.The price was not expensive at all. If I hadn't discovered the place on my second to last day there I would've gone for a second ride.Highly recommended! If you wanna explore the city fast, rent a bike here."

His english was broken and it was difficult to understand, which is unfortunate for a tour guide. The bikes were extremely uncomfortable and I was sore for two days after.

Sasha was our guide and he was outstanding. His good sense of humor and calm kept our large group at ease, even with a couple of flat tires, falls, and fear of heights. The ride started through the cobblestone old town but soon led to a beautiful bike path along the Vltava river. There wasn't much bike traffic and it was awesome passing homes and locals enjoying the river and the many beer gardens we passed. We stopped for beer along the way, and then for lunch at an awesome restaurant~the menu was completely in Czech so Sasha interpreted for us. The ride was pretty flat most of the way-we did cross a bridge which freaked out one gal and led to a spat with her boyfriend for leaving her high and dry but Fernando, the other guide, held her hand and helped her cross. The couple eventually made up. The little bit of drama kept it interesting and everyone on the tour seemed to enjoy themselves tremendously. We made it to the castle and toured it~ very interesting! Then took the train back to Prague. I've been on many bike tours but Sasha far surpassed any other guides I've had. He told us great stories and had vast knowledge of the history and area. I would highly recommend this tour and be sure to ask for Sasha!"

We opted for the easier ebikes. Total cycle length was approximately 40 km, which was done at a leisurely pace to suit the group. The tour was led by an amazing guide- Sasha (probably the most helpful guide I have come across, nothing was too much trouble for him). Apart from an initial section on roads through Prague (which Sasha guided us through excellently) the majority of the ride was on cycle paths through the lovely Czech countryside. Although we had ebikes we switched off the power for the majority of the ride, only putting it back on the help us up a couple of shortish hills. On route we could stop to take photos and Sasha rotated around the group to keep us informed of our surroundings, get to know us and check we were ok. Not far from the castle we stopped for lunch at a popular (with locals) restaurant which offered a good choice of food at excellent prices. Sasha did an excellent job of both translating the menu and then explaining further what the dishes were like. Once we arrived at the village of Karlstejn we had a short walk up a steep hill to the castle which was very picturesque surrounded by lovely views. We returned to Prague on the train with our bikes where again Sasha was a great help. The total trip was about 8 hours long and was thoroughly enjoyable with a great guide. I would recommend this to anyone spending a few extra days in Prague."

The tour takes you to some parks on the hills around the city, so the views are amazing and we were able to get a sense of what the city was like in just a couple of hours. It was a great start to five wonderful days in Prague. Thanks Daniel and Praha Bikes!"

We did it with 2 small children and the Praha Bike people accommodated us very well with children seats fitted to our bikes. The tour is mainly over flat grounds, at a reasonable pace with frequent stops at historic points. The route also tries to avoid traffic and some tourists. The bikes are well maintained and the commentary was insightful. Our group was 11 people (young and old ) and well managed. We would recommend this tour to all!"

Had a few extra days in Prague and decided to bike 18 miles out to Karlstejn, along the river and through the countryside.It was scorching hot the day we went, with temps nearing 40 degrees celsius, but it was a wonderful ride nonetheless. Our guide Jana was wonderful - she knew the route well, but made sure she didn't ride too far. She also gave a great history of King Charles the IV, as well as the history of Karlstejn. We stopped for lunch close to the castle, at an authentic Czech restaurant. i highly recommend ordering the drop scones for dessert. :)One word of warning, the cycling is described as easy - for the most part the ride was on level ground, but there were a fair number of hills, which my poor sister had trouble scaling. She had to dismount and walk her bike up most of those times. I would recommend this tour only to those who have a decent amount of conditioning, especially for biking long distances."

Just returned from Prague, spent 5 days there last week, always make sure we do some sort of city sightseeing when in any city, This time was no exception, did the bus , boat and Prague castle tours, best of those was the castle tour by far. So next came Praha bike city tour, and Mira our tour guide, about 17/18 of us on the tour and Mira left no stone unturned, she explained everything in just enough detail so we all knew the history of not just the city and its origins, but the main people involved over the centuries and the places they built, most of which we visited on the tour. Nice 15 min break half way for a cool beer(about 38 degrees that day). Mira made sure everyone was made to feel part of the whole Prague experience. Praha bikes team did the rest, right size of modern bike for all the different shapes and sizes, helmets if needed or wanted, so all I can say is thank you Mira and Praha bike city tour, do use this company when in Prague for your bike tour or bike hire."

We booked the following tour: Troja Chateau Bike TourMy review is skewed by the horrible weather we had, so please keep that in mind. 20 minutes into our ride, we were caught in a torrential downpour, which affected the whole tour. Please make sure you check the forecast before booking.The first 15 minutes of the tour took us a less than desirable route. It was a bit sketchy, but still fun to be active and not on a typical walking tour. After we waited out the rain (45 minutes under a really seedy underpass) we started to see some really great areas on the left side of the Vltava River. We passed several areas that could have been mentioned on the tour, but probably weren't since we were behind schedule and trying to get to the Chateau. Things you will pass include the freestyle kayak course on the river and a super cool Trojan Horse. We were too late arriving at the Chateau and it was closed seconds before getting there. The grounds and Chateau were very beautiful and the ride back was through some pretty parks. I know we would have had a much better experience, if not for the weather. Our guide was friendly and very nice, although he was having to translate in two different languages the entire trip, as the other couple was from Italy. I'd recommend this overall, though. There was one area that was a bit of a challenge, but the route was usually very flat and easy to manage."

He was completely service-oriented, spoke fantastic English, was personable, and made sure those of us who were less experienced bikers feel completely supported. I hope they pay him well!

It was approximately 24miles, mostly on a bike trail which was mostly flat, but with one hill (careful of the speed bumps on the way down). We could go at our own pace and we stopped every fifteen to twenty minutes for sites and watering. We stopped for a nice lunch at a restaurant about five to ten minutes from the village below the castle. The castle sits up on a hill above a small quaint village with nice views up to the castle. After visiting the castle, it is a five minute or so bike ride to the train station. Biking through Prague city streets is a bit of a challenge with cobbles, people and cars. It is not a bike friendly city, but the bike trails are nice once you get to them. They are mostly paved. I highly recommend a private tour so you can go at your own pace, but there are pros and cons with either I am sure."

The tour was 2.5 hours, relatively easy, and provided a wonderful overview of the city (I wish I would have done this on our first day to get acquainted with the city!). The biking is easy and you avoid most of the high-traffic areas. Our tourguide was Mira, who was just delightful. Our group of 8 people (4 couples) was fairly diverse, but no one had any issues understanding her. She did go quite into the details of Prague and Czech history, which I loved. Praha Bike also offers Segway tours, but we chose the bikes, mainly because of the price difference. It seemed quite affordable and a good value for the money! I would definitely recommend taking at least one tour from Praha Bikes, at least to get a good overview of the city. Mira was wonderful, and it was definitely a highlight of our trip."

So get off the bus, jump on a bike, ask for Sasha as your guide and you will not regret it!Signed, Boris, representing Old Folks on Spokes, Washington, D.C."

Nick was our guide who was very knowledgable of the city and helpful in giving advice on where to go and what to see in Prague. Despite it pouring with rain it did not dampen the tour as we all had such a nice time cycling around Prague, taking in the sights and stopping off for a warm drink in a lovely cafe in a park. Highly recommend it."

Initially we booked an afternoon trip to Troja Chateau, but curiosity got the best of us and we also decided to try the all day bike ride to Karlstejn Castle the following day. Cheers to George,(I can't remember his Czech name), who captivated us with his great personality, and immense knowledge of Czech history, and led us on the Troja Chateau trip. We were a group of 6, 3 adults and 3 kids who were 16, 20 and 21. After a nice, brisk bike ride, a tour of the Chateau, and a visit to the Letna Beer Garden, we each were completely satisfied! So\u2026.the next morning we met at 9:30 at Praha Bikes and were introduced to our guide Nick. He is from Massachusetts and lucky for us a history major who spent time in the Czech Republic. Great guy, full of interesting facts, put the history of the Czech Republic in simple terms, and made the day just perfect by really making an effort to spend time with each one of us on the ride. He was professional, safety conscious and very knowledgeable. The ride was absolutely beautiful, flat bike path through gorgeous countryside. We made a few stops, had lunch right outside the castle in a neighboring town, and rode to up to Karlstejn Castle. After walking around the grounds of the castle, we took the train back to Prague. It was one of my favorite days of our vacation\u2026.nice to get out of the city and see the backroads and countryside!! Two great trips, two great guides. Highly recommend both!!!"

We stop for a quick brew then take off for the castle only to stop again for lunch. Make sure you wear something athletic, it can be strenuous only for no more than 10 minutes of the entire day. Once you get to the castle be sure to have your expectations in check. The purpose of the castle was to only store the family jewels, so it's not as extravengant as I expected. The only reason I gave this tour 4 stars instead of 5 is because our tour guide, as nice as he is, really didn't give us any historical context... ever! Other than that it was a blast, don't forget to stay in a line!"

Both tours were terrific - a super way to see a bigger slice of Prague and a great orientation to the city. Both of the leaders were very good - they kept a nice easy pace, checked the group behind themselves often, stopped frequently to explain sites and allow for photos, and were all-around friendly. The bikes are solid and have fat tires (good qualities for the cobblestoned areas) and hand brakes, and are easy to use. FYI: The city tour is on flat but densely-pedestrianed ground, the castle tour has some significant climbs and one big drop, all of which were safely handled by our guide and our group (which had widely varying ages, biking abilities and levels of athleticism). Don't let fear of hills scare you; anyone can manage the castle tour and it is well worth it. We saw parts of Prague we never would have seen on foot, and also found the bike tours a terrific way to escape the madding crowds. Highly recommended!"

The biking was on bike paths, lanes, ramparts and roads, a bit bumpy because of the cobbles, but the bikes had fat tyres and were well suited to this. It was mostly flat with a few hills which were quite manageable with the gears. Some of the stops had wonderful views of the city. Jana gave us lots of information and told us what to expect.

We were led by a very affable and eager-to-please Nick and were joined by one other couple from Germany. Nick is also one of the two mechanics so there was no fear in any bike issue as we had 20 miles ahead of us (in fact he made some key adjustments to a fellow riders bike). The bike ride was long but never arduous and provided many scenic views including red poppy flowered fields and cute rivers. We had informational stops as well as a beer stop and lunch at an incredibly excellent lodge. I found my meal to be one of the best of our Prague trip. Besides being a guide/mechanic, Massachusetts-raised Nick is a history teacher so his enthusiasm for the experience was very evident. His aim was to please offering whatever information he could. We enjoyed getting to know him. The tour paid for our beer stop as well as our train tickets back into the city. It is a lengthy ride with some large hills so first-time cyclists be warned."

As a local, Vacek knew a lot about the city and was able to take a large group of cyclists through the city with ease. The riding was not difficult at all, despite lots of cobble stoned areas, and breaks were frequent to catch up on some local sites, history and drinks. Highly recommended way to see this wonderful city!"

Relaxed and comprehensive, it is a good way to start your visit in this beautiful city. From all of the main points of interest, to an interesting look at the work of sculptor David \u010cern\u00fd, the only missing piece is another hour or two to take in more sights. Be sure to ask Travis about the local beers, he's something of a beer sommelier."

We were only 3 in the tour in addition to our guide Francesco. He was very knowledgeable about Prague and Karlstejn and we had a great time riding with him. 90% of the ride is on bike paths along the Vltava and Berounka rivers, which makes it so enjoyable. I actually wouldn't have minded coming back to Prague the same way!I recommend taking the 50-min tour inside the castle, which was very informative. Keep in mind the castle was not used primarily as a residence but as a fortress (to protect the crown jewels of the Czech kingdom and the Holy Roman Empire), so you won't find inside the kind of lavish decoration and furniture that you see in other famous Czech castles (Hluboka, Cesky Krumlov).We came back to Prague by train and had a final short ride in from the train station to Praha Bike's office.

However, Sasha and Travis were able to make my experience in Praha awesome by accepting me at the last minute and doing a bike tour. Travis was excellent and knew the city very well. I'm glad they were both able to accommodate a short notice request. Next time I'm in Praha I will defiantly do another bike tour with this company."

The ride itself was not hard at all but the ride is well over 1 hr so the butt will get sore without the padding! Stopped at a pub situated along the route for a beer part way thru the ride there - was a great little break and the beer was excellent! We also had lunch before walking UP to the castle. The restaurant that our guide chose was not fancy but the food was excellent, authentic and not expensive.Our guide Nazar was excellent, he was super pleasant, didn't rush the group and made my experience wonderful!"

We went to lunch afterwards with Sasha to a traditional czech restaurant which was lovely and very cheap. This was not part of the tour. It was Sasha just being very hospitable inviting is to join him.

It made it seem as if this was a leisurely tour with stops along the way. Fun right? No. We were given one little bottle of water for a 20+ mile ride. The ONE stop was at a beer garden-ish. Our guide told us to get a bite to eat \"if we wanted\" but this wasn't lunch. If we hadn't had something to eat, I would have fallen over from the heat and pure exhaustion. Then you get to the castle and have to hike up hill. This tour felt like fat camp vs. a leisurely ride in the country. A few suggestions for Praha tours:1: Provide ample water or inform guests to bring it.2: Accurately describe this tour. We would have enjoyed it if we knew that this was an athletic ride. I have plenty of pairs of bike shorts. I would have brought them had the tour been correctly described.3: Provide some granola bars or something.4: Give everyone a cheap photo copied map of the route in case you get separated. Two people in our group got completely separated from the group - we lost them for HOURS. And at one point my two travel partners and I were separated for about 15-20 minutes until our guide realized we had been left behind.5: If someone says they can't ride a regular bike and need a hybrid (electric bike), just tell them to take another tour. This is not for them."

You start at the city centre bike hub where you are allocated a very comfortable bike in good condition and plenty of gears. We had Jana as our guide.Then started the tour and you have to cycle out of the city. This is when I must warn others that you need to be proficient on a bike and be capable of changing gears. You initially have to cycle through city traffic and trams before you reach the river paths. Even then while the route is generally flat, there are inclines and short hills and the pace was comfortable but certainly faster than slow. A couple of our group did not meet these criteria and struggled.Once we were out of the city, the tour is along river paths and occasional village streets. The views are lovely but don't expect to cycle past historic monuments and places of interest. We stopped for a morning coffee or beer approximately halfway (your expense). We also had lunch in the village of Karlstejn which was excellent (also your expense) before walking up to the castle. That is when you discover that the interior is not really worth seeing, it is all about the impressive view of its exterior. So don't bother paying the entrance fee. That said, Jana took us around the free parts within the castle walls and admired the views back to the village below.Then you catch the train back to Prague (ticket is included in the tour price) for another cycle through the streets of Prague back to base. We got back at around 5.30pmOverall I loved this trip and would recommend it to anyone who knows how to truely cycle a bike. However, I'm not sure if the two ladies at the back of the group who struggled to keep up and cycle their bike would agree."

As a daily bike commuter and avid weekend cyclists, we jumped at the chance to do a 23 mile ride in the country to a castle.We almost booked with another company based on a flyer, but checked out the t.advisor reviews, and with only 11 reviews, and only 2 since 2012, booking with these guys was a no brainer, as all the reviews were as good as it gets.Booking was easy, on line through PayPal.The bikes -were in good working order, comfy seats, water, carriers for all your stuff, 18 or more gears, plenty of rangeThe group-8 in all, of mixed ability, but all totally capableThe ride- basically totally flat, along the river for the most part, very easy ride even for folks who do t ride, great scenery, nice little villages and a spectacular castle at the end, interesting architecture all along the route,Route conditions- mainly paved with a small amount of single track on firm ground through some scrub, small amount of traffic riding in the city, but all in all very good conditions even on the cobble stones. Bikes performed great in all conditionsAt this point I would review the experience as 5 stars, why only 3 stars you may ask. ....?Our guide jana was very nice and pleasent, except very inexperienced.As this was a long ride and not a city tour, we did not expect a blow by blow commentary on every site we passed, from other reviews of this ride the guides gave at least some discriptions.Between prague and the castle we were told the name of the two rivers we crossed only, and nothing at all else!, for real, I mean nothing else at all.My fellow riders thought this a little odd that not even the names of the village's we passed through were not even mentioned, let alone any of the wonderful sites. Most other rides I have been on, at the stops they at least give a brief description of where you are going. So this is really no big deal as we were there to ride. What was most disturbing was the guide never once,looked back to check on her group, this was noticed by all of us, once we realized this was not just a fluke of not seeing her look back at all we started looking out for each other. ! As the path took many turns, some not well marked and the group was spread out at times, and none of us knew the way, the guide would just turn off and if you did not see which way she whent, or see another of the group you were screwed, myself and another rider kept back to make sure the others could see where to go, on at least 2 occasions the turn off was not clear and I'm sure we would have lost a few otherwise.On another occasion on a long straight part I noticed 2 of our party were not in sight so I road back about 1/2 km, and still could not see them, they eventually came into view and had stopped for photos,( as we only stopped once at a pretty crappy, dirty smokey bar), it took us a while to catch up, but it could just as easily been someone had fallen off.By this point our impression of the guides cycling and tour experience was pretty low, and this was confirmed as we watched her attempt to change a flat, which to her credit she managed to do, but to all watching it was clear jana had not changed a bike tire often,( yes the chain needs to around the gears for the bike to work, and the axel needs to fit into the slots on the frame before you tighten the wheel, and it helps if the wheel is centered in the frame so it is not hard up against the frame, but I digress)That said, it was a great ride, but the guide should really look back and make sure they do a head count once in a while, especially after a turn or going through traffic.I would recommend this ride but suggest you check ahead, and see if kat, sasa, or Vladimir are doing the tour to the castle as their reviews are excellent."

We were apprehensive to whether it would be worth the effort at first as we had all enjoyed a few to many beers the night before the bike tour! However, the outdoor air, exercise and sheer enjoyment whilst on the tour soon surpassed out hangovers and it was well worth while doing. Our tour guide \"Sasha\" (apologies if that is a spelling mistake) was fantastic, very knowledgeable, friendly and also funny and welcoming. We were tempted to invite him for a beer with us! After the tour he generously offered to share his local knowledge of good bars, restaurants and sites to see on the remainder of our trip.The tour itself involved very interesting history of the city and opened our eyes to the gloomy political struggle the city has survived over the previous centuries. It showed us great things we would have never otherwise seen or known about and was a brilliant laugh at the same time.The only thing I would have done better would be to go on the tour on the very first day instead of halfway through the trip as we did as it really gives you a scope, knowledge and taste for the city. 10/10"

However our tour guide Kat kept us all together. Kat was a friendly, lively tour guide, giving a fun interesting narrative along the route. Plenty of time was allowed for pictures and taking in the 12 location stops. After this first tour Kat and the other employees were available or any last minute tips for the rest of your holiday. My second tour was the panoramic and castle tour, this time it was just me and Daniel from montreal being lead by Sasha. Again a friendly lively tour guide, who agreed to slightly alter the route to make it more challenging and see slightly different areas to the classic city tour.I will mention that initially i booked a full day tour however i was the only one booked on and so it was changed to two 2.5 hour tours i was told this one day before, slightly late notice but the tours were still very fun and i would definitely recommend them as a great way to see prague."

We started in Dlouha in the old town and visited some very interesting sites that I had previously not covered on several visits to Prague on foot or by bus.Travis is in his first year as a guide and although he does not know everything his passion and enthusiasm means he will learn quickly.The weather today was not great but he supplied rain macs for the riders. It did not rain too heavily during the ride but collectively we did not stop for a break reserving that in case of extreme downpours. this proved to be the correct decision as as soon as the tour concluded it rained heavily.For me the most interesting sites were the David Cerny pieces, the dancing building and Jan Palach Square.Travis certainly knows his history and the information about Jan Palach, Reinhard Heydrich and Jan Hus for me were very interesting.So much better that a walking tour as it is more intimate and you really get good information from the guide"

I haven't ridden a bike in a number of years, and it wasn't as easy to pick up where I left off as I had expected, Sasha was extremely patient with the entire group and took it at a pace to suit everybody. Once we reached the castle complex Sasha took us slightly further up to the Petrin Lookout Tower, which isn't actually part of the tour but we had made good time. The ride down from here was breathtaking, offering more beautiful views of the city. When we were finished with the tour he also offered a few tips on places to eat and drink.

My husband and I wanted to organize a day long bike ride for our trip to Prague this past month, and came across Praha Bike online a few weeks before we left. We saw the information for longer bike rides (over a few days) that go all the way from Prague to Dresden along the Elbe river, but we contacted them to see if we could customize a bike ride along the Elbe for one day only. Oleh, one of the co-owners of the shop, responded to my email very quickly, and gave us options for the ride with or without a tour guide, and for 30 or 50 km. We decided that it would be much more fun with a guide who spoke the language (we don\u2019t!), and decided to do the 50 km ride. Oleh himself came with us on the ride (along with his friend Alex), and he was a fantastic guide and host! The bikes were ready when we got to the shop, they were loaded into the van for us, and we were all driven to our starting point in Melnik, a very nice, small town located where the Elbe and Vltava rivers meet. The ride was beautiful, and for the most part, extremely flat, which was perfect for us as we do only recreational cycling. We stopped for lunch about halfway in a quaint town, Roudnice, and sat outside overlooking the river while enjoying traditional Czech food. The ride ended in Litomerice, another quaint town on the river, where we were met again by the van, and driven back to our hotel in Prague. Both Oleh and Alex were exceptional tour guides, talking a lot about what we were seeing as we cycled along the river. Overall, it was a really great day, and Praha Bike Shop did a superb job in ensuring we had a good time."

You ride at a leisurely pace on mostly flat road or path through gorgeous countryside and quaint villages. Frequent stops along the way if needed. You see the castle overlooking the village once you get to Karlstejn. Then it is a nice walk up to see the castle. We chose not to go in but the outside was enough. Sasha was knowledgeable about the history and seemed to enjoy telling us stories. He showed us around then brought us back down a great wooded path that was off the main road. We had lunch at a nice local place that accommodated my food allergies (Sasha helped with that). The train ride back was filled with more stories. We were back before we knew it. Awesome off the beaten path trip. I highly recommend if you have the time while in the Czech Republic to contact Praha Bikes ask for Sasha and book your day trip to this castle."

Perhaps Prague is not aesthetically beautiful (although there is interesting artwork and sights throughout the city), but it is certainly a city chockfull of history lessons! As others have mentioned, having Travis as a guide was a definite plus! I thought it was great that he shared with our group a little about his background and why he chose to move to Prague.

The staff (didn't manage to get his name!) was still friendly, nice and calm and didn't get mad at us.We didn't have the best day to go on this tour as it rained continuously throughout the day but we didn't let that ruin this experience. Our guide, Sasha, passed on ponchos and that was fine. More on the tour.. It was advertised as a 30km ride on Viator.. However we clocked a 40km ride instead. I think the route might be challenging for older folks or people who do not really exercise (like me!) as there are some uphills and rough terrain. However, if it's too steep/hard to ride, you can always get down your bike to push. The scenery & castle visit at the end is beautiful and I think the experience is well worth the pain in my thighs and butt at the end of the day.Sasha is a wonderful friendly young man. He didn't let anyone feel alone and chatted with us throughout the whole journey. He also adjusted the pace accordingly and always kept a look out for our safety. Our group had 2 flat tires and he got them changed quickly. He also introduced some nice places to eat after that, and we really loved his recommendation.

My guides Jana, Eliza and Sashay were all very informative and fun. I also rented a bike from Praha for the 4 days I was in Prague. The bike I was allocated was in a very good condition and I appreciated the extra maps, and puncture tyre kit I was allocated. My only suggestion would be regarding the Karlstejn Tour: we were an abnormally large group which meant the ordering and paying for lunch ended up taking quite a while for the restaurant. The restaurant also did not split bill. One suggestion would be for Praha bikes to form I an alliance with a particular restaurant on the hill and let them know in advance of the numbers coming for the day. Other then that it was a very professional organisation."

While you will need a full day and some energy, biking out to Karlstein Castle with Praha High bikes as your guide over the bumps, up the hills, along the river, and topped off by a visit to a castle built in the 14th c., it's worth the energy extended! It rained our entire time, but there wasn't a complaint in our group of seven. Sasha, our guide, was fabulous - looking after us, guiding us through a Czech menu and encouraging us up the one hill we encountered. Our group consisted of one Slovenian (Sasha), two Ozzies, two from Singapore, three from Scotland, and one from the U.S. (ranging in age from 21 \u2212 68. My day was the highlight of my stay in Prague. Hop on a bike. Put a Praha Bike tour on your list of To Do's whether it's a 40k trip, as was ours, our a couple hour pedal around the city."

Our 2.5 hour bike tour of Prague have gone by really fast - shame on us we decided not to go for the 6.5 hour tour!We're definitely not sporty (that's why we were dubious at first), still you do not have to be a bike-junkie to enjoy it, we can assure you that.It was fun! The centre of the city is mostly flat and there's plenty of pedestrian zones, so nothing too challenging or dangerous. You can enjoy the wonders of the city while riding, and every time you stop in front of some nice spot or building you get the opportunity to discover the history of Prague thanks to your guide, along with some amenities and fun facts you won't read on any book.We were lucky. Elisa was our guide. Though she seems British (red hair, blue eyes, really fluent in English), she's Italian (just like us!), she's a very nice girl, kind and well prepared. Besides, we've later discovered that actually French is her mother tongue.You should definitely try this bike tour. Little advice, go pub crawling the night AFTER the tour... ;)Thanks to Elisa and \"bravo\" to all the guys who have come up with this idea!"

The route is not strenuous but in the end it is a good workout before the tasty lunch that awaits once in Karlstejn village. The icing on the cake is Travis, the tour guide, who is very knowledgeable about Czech history and makes sure the tour is fun and interesting, and truly takes care of everyone on the tour. We highly recommend Travis and Praha Bike, and particularly this itinerary to Karlstejn, It's a great way to spend the day."

We happened to be staying only up the road, saw the sign as we walked by and looked it up on the internet later. Booked our tickets, and came by the next morning. Easy! There was a small mixup with the guides, so we were a bit delayed with the start. It didn't really bother us, but as with most things when you travel, do budget a bit of extra time if you need to be anywhere after. We ran late because of our late start (which was nice of the guide to do even though he had an evening tour to do as well!). Prague streets seems a little scary at first to the inexperienced, but you get the hang of it quickly. We had a second trainee guide with us, who was great for looking out for us too. Most of the terrain is flat, with a few hills, but they are mostly spaced out throughout the day. And there are plenty of stops too. Would highly recommend to everyone!"

I was one of two people on the trip along with a trainee guide and our official guide, Sa\u0161a. The whole Praha Bike experience was good and Sa\u0161a was an excellent guide and a credit to the company, with excellent knowledge of Praha and Karlstejn and even needed to fix a puncture, which he did on the train on the way back to Praha. His English is also excellent. The trip went at the pace of the customers and was clearly centred around customer wishes when choosing breaks and places to eat. The bikes were also good. As a cyclist I noticed that they had Shimano Deore gears, so clearly not the very cheapest. A word of caution to UK visitors: the brakes are the opposite way around, although I think we British are the odd ones! Altogether a great trip. I would happily use Praha Bike again."

We had lots of activities scheduled for the days we were there, so being able to schedule an evening tour was great. Our guide was Travis, an American who lives in Prague and is passionate about it. That showed in his thorough and thoughtful descriptions of all of the places we stopped at - from a haunted church to the Jewish Quarter to the John Lennon Graffiti Wall to the Main Square and a number of other destinations in between. He answered all of our questions and was very considerate and kind with us. He took us several places we would never have seen on our own, which was another benefit. Prague is not yet an especially bicycle-friendly city compared to other European cities (lots of cobblestone streets and not many bike lanes) so it was good to have a knowledgeable guide like Travis. This tour covers almost all flat terrain in the Old Town and Little Quarter and is not strenuous at all. A great introduction to central Prague! Tip - this is a 2.5 hour tour that runs at 7:00 PM and 8:00 PM every evening in the summer, BUT it requires booking at least a day in advance - don't expect to show up 10 minutes before and book it on the spot."

Our guide Jana was extremely knowledgeable, friendly and took us to a few places off the regular tour because some people asked if she would. The tour covers everything you would want to see and know and the lunch spot was perfect, not an overpriced touristy place. The ride itself was more challenging than I expected, with many hills, but you see everything you can't cover on foot. You do need to be in shape for this all day tour. The cobblestone streets do get tiresome after a while, so if you have cycle shorts wear them, but I was ok in my regular street clothes. Jana gave me ideas on what to do the next two days I was staying, but I really did see everything I wanted, or would've seen or known about, on the tour."

Our guide, Sasha, made the tour very interesting with great historical information, funny stories, random facts, and chose a variety of sights throughout Prague. I did find that riding a bike through Prague was a little out of my comfort zone. It's a very busy city with lots of tourists, lots of other bikers, pedestrians, very short tram crossings, cobbled streets, and basically lots of things that I found distracting while on a bike. This wasn't an issue for my husband so I guess it depends on how great you are on a bike. Overall, good time, great guide."

Alex showed us round parts of Karlstejn Castle which is very pretty and worth a visit. We travelled via train with the bikes back to Prague although Alex was willing to bike back if we\u2019d wanted to.If you would like a 20 mile bike ride through Prague and the countryside, I recommend this tour. Thank you Alex K for a wonderful day."

We had so much fun we decided to go on the all day castle tour a couple days later. Our guide for that was Sasha and it was even better. Lot of great scenery and fun stops along the way. He gave an excellent tour of the castle town and the outer part of the castle itself. Much of the castle can only be visited with an official tour. Sasha was very flexible in letting us decide if we wanted to do that or not. He was actually very flexible the entire time allowing us a fair amount of flexibility. The return on the train was even fun as Americans we have little experience with trains. I recommend the city tour as fun way to get oriented and a long tour if you want to get outside of Prague and see the countryside."

Raincoats and a bottle of water were provided, but making it to Carlstejn just as the thunderstorm hit was one of the day's highlights. We ate a hearty Czech lunch then walked up to the castle, learned of its history and looked around the free section. Daniel was a pleasure: knowledgeable, interesting and affable.

I was a little apprehensive about the tour because I\u2019m not a very experienced biker (I only ride a bike once or twice a year). But I think anyone who knows how to ride a bike and has a moderate level of stamina would enjoy this tour. The pace was leisurely allowing time to enjoy the scenery, stop to take some pictures, etc. Our cycling time to the castle was about 3.5 hours for a total of about 18 miles. About a third of the way we stopped in a small village for a drink, then on to Karlstejn Village for lunch in a traditional Czech restaurant. We tried the pickled cheese (apparently a local delicacy) which was actually quite good. Then, we left our bikes behind to walk up to the castle grounds. After visiting the castle, it\u2019s a short bike ride back to the Karlstejn station. The train ride from Karlstejn to Prague was less than 30 minutes and the bike ride from the station back to the Praha Bike office was less than 10 minutes. Our guide Daniel was terrific \u2013 friendly, knowledgeable and very attentive. Our tour group was very small \u2013 just my husband and I (generally I think tour group size is around 3-6 people). The bikes were in very good condition. With the exception of 5-10 minutes leaving and returning to the center of Prague (which doesn't have heavy traffic), you are on a bike path or the occasional country road where car-drivers are used to bikers. I am extremely glad I did this tour and highly recommend it."

The guide was great, tour group was small, and the ride was breathtakingly beautiful. This is a low intensity ride with very few hills, but participants need some level of stamina since the ride is several hours in duration.The reason to do this particular tour ought to be the scenery.

I really feel I \"know\" Prague, after doing this tour."

There are very friendly guys work here, they advise most profitable fares for you, settle the matters of parking in your hotel, if you rent bike at several days. We explored Prague district two days without any problems, visited Karlstein, Cernosice and several pretty villiages. I will advise Prahabike to all my friends who plan to spent vacation in Prague.

It was a quick preview for all you want to see in the city. Takes a while to get used to the cobblestone and dodge pedestrians but it was still worth it! Sa\u0161a was very informative, easy going and fun. After the tour, Sa\u0161a gave us a map of the city with restaurant suggestions which was extremely helpful! Lots of places around old town square are pretty expensive/touristy so try to avoid that.Overall, I highly recommend this tour if it's your first time in Prague! Thanks Sa\u0161a! :)"

It is a 2-2.5 hour bike tour which covers old and new town and we got to see some really cool sites like the graffiti wall and the \"islands.\" I would suggest doing this tour as one of your first activities in Prague because you get to see a lot of the city and then you can visit those places later. Sa\u0161a was so nice and answered all of our questions. He even gave us suggestions and showed us places to eat and go out at night. He also spent time with us after the tour and marked up a map for us with his suggestions. The only thing I had a hard time with was getting used to the cobblestone so perhaps wear good shoes. Otherwise this was a great first biking tour experience for me!"

This was kind of nice since we were able to ask him more questions and personalize the trip a bit based off our preferences. Sa\u0161a was very knowledgeable when it came to Prague history and he was able to answer all of our questions. Moreover, he was funny and kept the tour very interesting. The bike tour was a great way to see the important sites in Prague and I think this is the best way to begin your trip here. As a tourist, it's hard to get accustomed to the city and it's very easy to get ripped off by local vendors. However, Sa\u0161a was able to guide us to some good local spots and even took a detour on the trip to show us some restaurants. Overall, we had a great time and would recommend this trip to anyone new in Prague!"

Mostly the level was easy, except for one substantial hill which some of our group just had to walk up for a few minutes. No big deal. I went by myself, as my 2 travelling companions weren't up for it...a great way to get to know new people! The lunch was very good, castle also quite nice but most impressive looking at it from below in my opinion. No one in our group was up for a tour inside so I can't report on that.

Our guide gave us more of an insight into living and working in Prague more anecdotal than the architectural history of some of the buildings.We rode out along the river and visited 3 beer gardens (small beer included) and rode through parks and pretty much stuck purely to cycle paths so I didn't get the fear. The city centre and major sights may not be built for bike users, but the beer gardens certainly are!"

However, after getting ask several times on and after the ride and then getting an email from Praha Bikes encouraging me again, I decided to write it. First off, I thought the ride itself around the city was excellent. I also thought our guide, Kat was nice and energic. That said, two things really bothered me about the tour. First, there were lots of jokes about the partying ex-pats - where they drink, how much they drink, and how awesome it is. I think Prague is an amazing city. But the thing I like least about it is frankly the drunken ex-pats whose primary mission it seems is to get as wasted as often as possible. There was a couple from New Zealand on my tour and I was frankly embarassed by the constant references to drinking. We were even encouraged at the end of the tour to visit a local pub because of all the great beers you could get. I thought, \"Really? That's what we should go do in the Prague?\" The second thing I found annoying was how little was actually convey about the city or country during the tour. This is a bike tour so I'm not expecting an indepth lecture. But I guess I was hoping for more than a rehearsed caption. This is actually a critique of other bike tours. Rather than offer a couple of tour-by trivia, what not mention three major challenges the city has struggled with in the last couple of centuries - or even in this century. Or three city-planning things that make biking in the city better? Or just three important reasons to care about the city - architecture, science, nature, or anything really. Again, I'm not looking for a doctoral thesis. But on this tour and the one I took in Paris, it was like hearing a tired script that lacked any context or reason to care. Again the bike ride was great and our guide was amiable. I would also add the the bikes themselves weren't great. My daughter's bike broke and we had to get it exchanged. My bike also had to be exchanged. I imagine they take a beating but I thought the bikes could have been in better repair."

Our search led us to a conversation with Praha Bikes. Since we were comfortable going it alone, traveling with our own bikes and touring unassisted, what we really wanted was a local contact in Prague who could help us with the really tough stuff. Things like helping us with airport transfers, bike mechanical issues if they came up after unboxing the bikes, maps and most importantly, local knowledge. The team at Praha bikes were awesome! They were happy to help us with what we needed and never tried to talk us into extras that we didn't. We'd love to do a tour with them someday. We'd highly recommend Praha if you are considering a bike tour along the Greenways or catch up with them on one of their other tours."

            "review": "Terrific 4 hours in Prague. We took two tours in prague - the chateau tour with kat, and the paroramic tour with vladimir earlier in the week. Both tours were great but quite different. The chateau tour is mostly flat and take you out of the city along the river. We stopped for delicious beers in two great outdoor locations and had a terrific time. There is just one big hill and its easy enough to push your bike up, if thats whats needed.The panoramic tour took us up by the prague castle for some terrific views however, you could walk up there to see the same thing. Nothing wrong with this one but we liked getting out of the city and stopping for beers at some prague non tourist spots. Oh, the chateau is very impressive to see but it isnt open so you walk around it and look at the gardens for 20 minutes.Both tours are easy to do if you are in decent condition and ride a bike once in a while. The washroom in the bike shop is a bit nasty so use one elsewere before you ride. The shop is easy to find as its close to the main square and astronomical clock. My suggestion is to get your Prague history and in town orientation using the excellent free walking tours (we used prague airport transfer service and their terrific free four hour tour).Remember to tip your guide at the end. We certainly recommend getting out on a bike outside of Prague!"

The bike tour part with our guide Vladimir was excellent!! Ask for him if you do any bike tours. He is a Czech resident and was a Teen during the early 90's and has a passionate viewpoint of the liberation going on at the time. The next part however (pub crawl) could have been better. There was supposed to be an organized dinner in between to a favorite Czech restaurant (dinner price not included but still supposed to be accompanied). That part didn't happen. They just told us to go grab a bite and then come back for the pub crawl. There was a large group and they basically just took us to a bar for one free hour of drinking. then on to two more bars for welcome shots and then to a nightclub. There was not \"tour\" part where they might have explained the history of the bar, etc. It was basically just follow around the horde and drink. I would have liked a smaller group and maybe some explanation of each locale. The guides were fun and enthusiastic though. I would have just enjoyed some history mixed in with the drinking."

Even for unexperienced cyclers it's a great route as it's 99% flat, you just need to sit back and enjoy the wonderful mountains and countryside around you. The castle itself and village below it are one of the most beautiful places I've seen in Europe. The nice thing about it is that the tour is much adjusted to the groups' desires \u2013 there's no official schedule and finishing time so you set the pace\u2026 you can either take your time and have a laid back tour, spend more time at the stops (beer and other drinks included in the price), or take it more seriously.But eventually, what made the tour so great was no doubt our guide Nick. Nick was very attentive to our preferences, suggested different route options, took us to his favorite points even if they were off the main route, adjusted himself to our pace and in Karlstejn he took us to the best restaurant in the Czech republic. Mainly, you could tell that his not in it just for the money and is very enthusiastic to share his passion and knowledge. It felt more like an outing with friends than a guided tour. Bottom line \u2013 ask of Nick."

Saw loads in the 2.5 hours, including places we probably never would have walked too. Must do if in Prague. Keep up the good work guys."

We opted for the electric bikes and although the weather worsened at the start of our tour, Praha Bike were more than happy to reschedule to the following day. Our guide Francesco was enthusiastic, knowledgable and really made the tour for us. This is the best way to see this fantastic place. Take a camera as you will see some of the best sights of the city. On top of all this we ended up with some great personal recommendations for places to eat and drink, which of course we had to try! Thanks to all the team at Praha Bikes and a special thank you to Francesco!"

This review is based on our trip to Karl\u0161tejn Castle.While the 8:45 AM starting time was early for my California sleep patterns, the journey made it well worth waking up. The scenery was beautiful. And the surprises (good) were plentiful. There's some coordination necessary for some of the tours at the castle. (http://www.hradkarlstejn.cz/informations-for-visitors-2013/guided-tours/ ) Note that without the castle tour you still see the castle - get to walk around the grounds, go down to the well, all with great information from the guide, but if your intent is to take the interior tours, coordinate in advance. Do: Bring a camera - there's plenty of pictures to be take Bring the right gear, though I believe Praha Bike can help out with some of it if needed. I brought a backpack with my waterproof jacket and camera. Lucy strapped a basket on so I didn't have to wear it all day \u2013 a nice bonus.Based on what I\u2019ve read on tripadvisor and my experience, expect the guides to be worth their weight in informational gold. Lucy was knowledgeable about the city, the countryside, and the castle. Everything from the suggested photo ops, delicious crepes, and wonderful insight into life in Prague was appreciated. D\u011bkuji to Lucy and Praha Bike"

We were a few minutes late, but the staff were expecting us since we made reservations and pre-paid online which was very convenient and easy to do. Helmets were included in the price and Francesco and the other staff found us good, comfy hybrid bikes and adjusted the seats accordingly. We reviewed bike safety and rules of the road prior to starting The pace and flatness of the Classic City Bike Tour was easy for a couple of 30-somethings and at the first stop Francesco checked to see how our bikes were working and made sure we were comfortable and not having any equipment problems. Francesco was extremely knowledgeable about architecture and the history of both the city and the various highlights of the tour. He was also very kind and took our picture upon request many times. We felt like we saw much more of the city than we would have been able to do so on foot and got a much richer history at the same time. The price of the tour was excellent and well worth the value and Francesco gave a stellar tour of Prague!"

My first time on a steroid-fueled electric bicycle through the Old City of Prague, across the river with mind-blowing views of Prague's famous bridges, to the top of the park with breath-taking views, and into the golden light of late afternoon sunlight on Prague's castle walls. Okay, downhill on cobblestones was not my favorite part but after a stop in the beer garden I was able to cope. Praha Bikes is a nice group of people, running a good operation. All were courteous, professional,and reliable. Don't miss this experience. Patti from Nevada, aged 66."

The ride was not difficult (all levels and ages could easily participate), yet it was nice to feel we got a big of exercise to work off all of the good meals we consumed during our stay.

After arriving at 1300 and checking into lodgings, I lucked out with Hatam Berrezouga as my guide for an evening Legends tour by bicycle. He engaged me in his story telling and invites admiration and affection for this unique city and history. He offered a 'buffet' of history and insights through linguistics, religion, politics, (ghosts), and polished off his tour with recommendations for his favorite places. I have been to 4/5 of his recommendations so far and found his assessment made expectations match experience--I enjoyed every one! Hatam's delight in this city he conveys with each story; it's infectious.The staff welcomed me back the next morning for a different tour and helped me settle into a better tour to round out my exposure. Daniel kindly showed me around for this one and patiently answered my questions. Daniel (and Hatam) helped me select a day out of Prague by bus adventure as well....By the completion of two Praha Bike tours, I had a sense of Prague then and now, as well as the ability to navigate by landmarks. What a splendid trip(!), free of floundering and frustrating time lost by getting lost. Thanks!"

I found Praha bike on tripadvisor and after reading the glowing reviews we planned our trip to Prague around two of their tours:Big City Bike Tour and Country Tour to Karlstejn. I am so glad we did. The reviews speak for themselves and we had an excellent trip.The Big City Bike Tour with Vladimir was an excellent introduction to the city. Vladimir was a great guide and I most enjoyed when he went 'off script' to tell us about life in Prague, the history, the politics and his experiences. He was great at gauging how we were feeling and open to us asking questions. We enjoyed Vladimir's tour very much - he was engaging, relatable and easy-going.The Country Tour to Karlstejn was one of our best days in Prague. The castle is just as a castle would be, the real highlight is biking through the country and villages (although it is nice to end up somewhere). There is a bike path for the majority of the way and pub stops. Lucy was an excellent tour guide with her knowledge, humour and ability to make the group comfortable. Despite a cloudy/drizzly morning, our group of 6 wanted to continue and we made it to the castle by lunchtime before the rain really started. My bikeseat was problematic but Lucy fixed it immediately. She also took the time to speak to each one of us during the long, flat terrain. At the end of the day she helped us plan our evening and we went out to a lovely jazz club. Lucy went above and beyond and we thank her very much for that!We think the best way to see a city is on bike so we find bike tours in all the cities we visit. Vladimir and Lucy were two of the best tour guides we have had. Would highly recommend Praha Bike Tours."

Staff are friendly, helpful and knowledgeable. Bikes are fine for the purpose (they take quite beating on the bumpy cobbled pavements and roads of the centre of Prague where mountain bikes with front suspension are wisely used). We hired bikes to cycle to Karlstein along the river and were given hybrids. In retrospect we would have preferred the mountain bikes, as some of the route need a Mountain Bike more than a Hybrid. But bike preference is very subjective. Any minor issues with the bikes were resolved on the spot. Nothing is too much trouble and we would use their services again.

It was amazing and she is awesome.We got a bit of history of Czech as well as the context of the locations where we were stoping. It gave us a lot of ideas of what to do in Prague. Do it early in your trip!The ride was generally easy with a couple of hills and Katherine was patient."

Being from Asia, first time over in europe, we were amazed by the beauty of this City, same as great customer service everywhere. Since we did not have much time, we decided to take a bicycle tour and it was a great choice. We saw almost everything in just couple of hours, learned all the history and it was a great fun too. Now i want to do bicycle tours everywhere I will go in the future :)"

The ride through the countryside was beautiful, and a great way to see different parts of the country. While the scenery was good, our guide was equally professional and friendly. She made sure that everybody was having a good time and comfortable.That being said, as we are not avid bikers, what was quoted as a 3.5 hour bike ride ended up taking 5.5 hours, and the bicycles were in terrible shape. A more realistic estimate of the trip duration would be helpful, but an improvement in the quality of bicycles (my kickstand rotated a full 360 degrees and even got stuck in the rear wheel a few times) is in order.That being said, I would take this tour again in a heartbeat."

I also enjoy maintaining my fitness even while on a vacation, so Praha bike tours was the perfect way for us to see the city in an active but safe way. We did the guided bike tours: Classic City tour as well as the Panoramic tour the following day and together they complement each other perfectly, giving you a complete view of the city. Francessco was our guide on both days, he was very friendly and extremely knowledgable and touring with him gave us an opportunity to learn alot about Prague in our short time there. We did the Panoramic tour which goes to the Prague castle on our last day there. A tip for travellers interested in the Panoramic tour would be to go there before the end of your stay, as I learnt some interesting facts about the castle and cathedral and would have liked to visit, but was out of time."

I had booked and paid for two bikes, airport transport and bike pick-up in Dresden from Praha Bike in advance. A polite and friendly employee picked us up at the airport and drove us to our Hotel. We booked the hotel ourselves and picked the Hotel \"Hastal Prague Old Town\", located just around the corner from Praha Bikes. Next morning we got the bikes at the bike-shop, got them adjusted and equipped with everything we needed for the trip. We left our remaining luggage (had already been on vacation for a week) at Praha Bike. 6 days later Oleh, the manager, met us in Dresden after we had completed the tour picking up the bikes and returning the rest of our luggage to us. I must say that even if the logistics was a little complex Parah Bike handled everything flawless. There was always a smile on the faces we met. Very good! The trip as such is also highly recomended. Also with a 11 year old. The bike paths are flat, mainly paved, and mostly without any motorized traffic. The landscape is beautiful and you are never far from some small friendly establisment serving food and refreshments along the route. We had 6 days for the complete route. I clocked us in at about 250km with a few minor detours. We brought tent and camping gear and stayed at camp sites for three nights. The other two nights we stayed at hotels (booked \"on the fly\" per phone using a list of accomodations provided by Praha Bikes)Very pleasant experience, for both father and daughter! Do the \"self guided tour\" and let Praha Bike provide bikes and \"logistical support\""

During a recent trip to Prague I pre-booked the Karlstejn Castle Tour and Panoramic City Tour on-line (no problems with pre-paying on-line, and Ondrej was very helpful with the process and answering my questions about the tours). In both cases, I was the only person to book the tours, but Praha Bike honoured the booking and so I had two great one-on-one tours with my guides. Jakub was my guide for a great day trip to Karlstejn Castle. He was terrific company and shared information and stories about life in the Czech Republic. He willingly took me on a side trip to the canyon at Velka Amerika, as I had heard about this site and it was not too far from the Castle. Jakub was also very happy to cycle the 30 km trip back to Prague, rather than taking the train (the usual mode of return for this tour).This trip to the castle and through the countryside on the way was one of my highlights on this trip to Central Europe. I also did the Panoromic City Tour with Ryan, an American ex-pat but very knowledgeable about Prague and the sites on the tour. He too was great company and a great guide.I highly recommend Praha Bikes and the tours they offer."

So, I was very lucky to have a one on one tour all the way to Karlstejn. My guide was Vladimir and he was great. He is a local with world wide experiences and was able to answer all my questions about the Czech Republic. The ride down to the Castle is very scenic and not difficult (and this is coming from an unfit person, we also rode on a day that was 38 degrees). I recommend this tour, it was a great way to see another side of the Czech republic and experience it with a local."

There aren't many hills, but some of the surfaces are pretty uneven and challenging for amateurs like us. Maybe they should run a separate tour for experts and one for amateurs! Our leader Andrew was really nice, friendly, knowledgeable and approachable. Bringing up the rear was Vic, who was patient and attentive and took care to make sure we tail-enders were safe and on the right track. On arrival at Karlstejn we had a nice lunch (at our own expense, the website says lunch at own expense but the paper brochure says lunch included!) followed by a strenuous walk uphill to the castle. We had been promised a vehicle would take the bikes back to Prague but this never materialised so we had to take them on the train and ride them back - on cobbles through pedestrians - to the bike shop. All in all it was a fun trip and a great experience, but amateur cyclists need to be warned this is a long trip and quite a strenuous one!"

I asked for a couple of stops a long the way and nothing was a problem. We did the night Legends tour. This was our first night type tour. Started at 8 and we were suppose to be done by 10:30 but our group ran a bit late. It was so much fun discovering the city as it got darker outside. Our guide Atem , made the history and the stops along the way interesting. On the subway ride home the kids just kept talking about how much fun it was."

On bikes, you can cover so much more than a walking tour and the night tour had fewer crowds to pedal through. Because we had been in Prague for several days, he seemed to adapt the tour spending more time on places that we had not seen. He even helped us find two places (Lennon's Wall and where Mozart lived) that we had looked for on previous days but.couldn't find. My daughters ( in their 20s), my sister and I are casual bikers, typically to the grocery store and back, and found the pace to be perfect."

Even though we had a large group (16 people) our cheerful tour guide, Jakub, kept the whole day moving and did an exceptional job looking after everyone and making this a really fun experience. The actual tour of the Castle (which is not operated by the bike shop) is not exactly over the top, but once you've ridden all the way out there you might as well go for it."

He spoke very good English and was very informative and fun. The castle in particular was a real spectacle and the commentary from Francesco very interesting.Cycling around a city is just about the right speed, walking takes too long to see everything and from a vehicle you cannot get up close. I cannot recommend this enough I do have a few negatives though and if those were fixed this would be an easy 5.First, the instructions to get there were poor and appeared to direct us to a different cycling provider which was very confusing. Luckily we arrived early so were able to clear this up. I am not sure if this was the fault of the agent who we purchased the tour through or praha bike themselves but either way it is in their interest to have better directions whoever is providing them.Secondly whilst the bikes were clearly of quite good quality when new, a few had maintenance issues. Mine had a loose mudguard which was not dangerous but rattled constantly and was irritating. One of our party had faulty brakes. There was a repair man along with us but it was not made clear to us this was his role until someone's chain broke about a mile from the end of the tour, if we had known perhaps we could have raised these issues with the repair man earlier.In short a great tour just slightly let down by a few problems."

The staff in the rental shop were friendly and helpful, the bikes have decent suspension which is essential for the cobbled streets, but do let staff know if you're not familiar with cycling amongst traffic- you have to have some confidence to cross some of the busier streets but Daniel ensured we did so as a group.

Our tour leader was Jacob, a second-year guide. Jacob was friendly, attentive and informative--he knows how to \"work the crowd\" in a pleasant manner. Jacob made sure every participant was welcomed and comfortable throughout the day. On the train ride home, Jacob visited with everyone and made suggestions for the rest of our Prague stay. Very classy.The ride (one-way with train return) is almost exclusively flat. The first half isn't very attractive as you snake through Prague and its close-in commercial zone. But the second half is quite nice as you make your approach to Karlstejn. There's a very nice break in which riders are treated to a refreshing beer or other drink.We'd only make one recommendation. The tour does NOT include admission to the Karlstejn Castle. Riders are given an option to take a tour on their own but that means holding up everyone else which is not desirable as there's not much to do/see in Karlstejn. We'd recommend that the tour company try to negotiate and include castle admission as part of the tour and have the tour leader give a VERY abbreviated tour. It seemed odd to ride all the way to Karlstejn Castle and not go in. But despite that, we'd still highly recommend the current tour. The exercise, fresh air and guide were fantastic."

            "review": "GREAT way to spend an afternoon in Prague!. We booked this tour based entirely on the other Trip Advisor reviews, and I'm really glad we did. For the record, we booked the Beer Garden tour. The bike office was easy to find, and they had more \"stuff\" there for us to use than I expected. Gloves if you need them, bungee cords for putting items in your bike basket, etc.We got our bikes and met our guide, and we were off! Our guide was Davide, and he was great- we loved him. He starts off the tour without really any talking aside from a very friendly introduction. You just bike through some busy streets to get out to the river, and then down the river and outside of the congested historic district. In talking to Davide later, he said he does this so that people can get accustomed to being on a bike, biking in a congested area, etc., and I think that's a smart move. I'm not used to biking in a city, and I was a little nervous and just wanted to focus on what I was doing. If Davide is your guide, rest assured you will have PLENTY of opportunity to sit and talk with him, and this guy knows his stuff. He's Italian by birth, smart, and a great conversationalist, so we had some great conversations about European history, Italian history, and of course Czech history, and he is knowledgeable and engaging.Anyhow, I don't want to ruin the surprises of the tour, but suffice to say you will get some unforgettable experiences, great photos, and some fantastic local flavor. (As well as a lot of knowledge about local beers! Davide single handedly turned me into a beer snob over the course of just a few hours.)Things you should know: While this isn't a terribly long bike tour, you will absolutely use some muscles- Prague is hilly. I'm in good/ very good shape (although I never bike), and there were some moments when my quads were screaming, but never more than 5 minutes or so. Second, as engaging and fun as Davide is, he can sometimes get ahead of you! When streets are crowded, it can be easy to get separated. I should have told him this- he was a super nice and easy-going guy, and I'm sure he would have slowed down. If I were to return to Prague, I would book another bike tour with this company, and I would request Davide specifically. I was really impressed with what we got for the money, and would encourage anyone to use some of their time for this tour."

Led by Oleh, and assisted by Davide, our tour was full of history as well as current information and news of the castles we passed, small towns we rode through, and bike trails we were on. Bike trails in the Czeck Republic were outstanding and sometimes under repair, but never a hindrance. Very impressive to ride upon and see the pride this country has with its bicycle paths. Scenery breath taking, lodging and meals more than excellent, the crew always eager to assist and answer any of our many questions. And did I mention the bicycles? Excellent, comfortable, A1 working order and not one problem. I wish I could do this trip again, today."

We had read some other reviews about the tour being too short and the guide being \"rude.\" We didn't have any of those experiences with the tour or with Kat. We learned a lot and Kat was a friendly and knowledgeable tour guide. The tour wasn't a full 2 1/2 hours, but it was because we were able to move around the town without running into traffic and throngs of crowds. We went through some of the back alleys and streets that we wouldn't have gone to by walking by ourselves. If we had more time, I would definitely go on another tour or a longer tour with this group. After the tour, the 6 of us that were on it together met a at a bar around the corner for a beer. Kat also joined us for a coffee. She was really open and wanted to make sure we mingled with the other people in the group. It was very easy to pay for this tour and there was plenty of room to sign up the day before, so no need to plan too far ahead."

We arranged the 61/2 hour bike tour with Praha Bike. We had a great experience Lucy was our guide and did an excellent job. We saw the city in a way you would never see it in a bus or cab. Amazing experience. The only negative was Prague is really not the best biking city from a stand point of being bike friendly as far as bike lanes etc. But do not let that detour you from this great biking adventure. As far as difficulty goes, My group are mid 50's and we had a couple that was in their 70's very much bikers though. But my point is we had no problems.. My only advise would be if you have not been on a bike in a few years, get on one and ride a little before the trip.. Highly Recommended"

Fortuna was great, very patient, and lots of fun. The ride through the countryside was so beautiful, and we had perfect weather on the day we went. You are only on roads for brief periods of time, otherwise you're making your way along the river on either paved or dirt bike paths and it's so quiet and peaceful. I had some speedy bikers in my group who were always well ahead of me, but I chose to go a little slower so I could look around and really take it all in. Fortuna made a few stops along the way to make sure we were all together and everyone was doing ok so I was able to catch up no problem. Bikes were in good shape and just right for the dirt paths. This bike trip was one of the best days of my vacation!"

My bike seat kept falling down and my wife's bike had a problem with the gears. We watched as our guide insulted both locals and other tourists. She did mention that she was slightly hungover. The tour itself was okay but we did not see alot of sights. I did not feel it was worth the 20 euros each and I have done alot of bike tours throughout Europe."

Even though it was raining and I was the only person to book the trip Praha Bike were happy to continue for me so just myself and my guide set off to Kasrlstejn Castle. This is a ride of around 3+ hrs to get to the Castle but can take longer if people are slower. Beautiful scenery and following the river on mostly on bike paths made for relaxing ride sans cars. A stop half way for coffee etc was an enjoyable break and then off to the Castle. We arrived very wet so my guide picked a lovely restaurant with a fire where after drying off and a great meal we walked the hill to the Castle. Weather cleared and a quick trip back to Prague by train saw the end of a most (if n ot wet) enjoyable day. Lovely way to see Czech Republic countryside!! Highly recommend this trip and company if you like a longer ride out of the hustle and bustle of the city. They were also very helpful and responded quickly to my emails in organising the ride."

There were 8 of us on the tour and our guide was Maria. She is only in her early twenties but her historical knowledge of Prague was fantastic. She knew so much about all the buildings and happily tackled all the questions thrown at her.The pace for this tour was extremely reasonable, so unless you have never ridden before, you should have no trouble keeping up.This really is a perfect introduction to the city, enabling one to return later on foot to any areas that were of particular interest. Also, if you take the tour, a 20% discount is offered on any other cycle tours you take during your stay."

Kat was a great tour guide - showed us all the sights, whilst we cycled round the town at a leisurely pace. There was 7 of us in the tour, so not too many. The weather was good. And all 4 of us (differing ages, interests and levels of cycling) had a great time. This was probably the highlight of our city break. Well worth a visit."

The tour is mostly on bike paths of varying descriptions. For me it was a great way to spend the day and get away from the hustle & bustle of Prague and into the countryside where life seems very peaceful and focuses on the river. The ride is flat all the way and the bikes are pretty comfortable with good gearing.Going with Andre was definitely worth it as opposed to just hirinig a bike - he is an authentic Czech and could give insight into life in Czech Republic as someone who grew up through markedly transitional years in this part of the world. Karlstejn itself was a pretty castle but I wasn't so interested in going inside which was very easily accommodated. This is a great option to spend your time after you have seen the 'must-see' sights in Prague."

They accommodated our 1 and 4 yr old in a croozer bike trailer, and our 5 yr old on his own bike, but fitted mine with a large baby/child seat and brought a bike lock along just in case he got too tired. To everybody's amazement, the interesting sites and pace of the tour were just right as our son kept his momentum going for the entire 3 hour, 7 mile customized tour! The vistas were breathtaking and having a tour guide explain the history and interesting highlights of the city and its landmarks was worth every penny. FYI, there are A LOT of cobblestones to bike over in this city. My son said sometimes riding on them gave him \"scrambled brains\" but he still kept on going. Andre, thanks for your patience with our family. We enjoyed your tour very much!"

Highly recommended as an introduction to this lovely city!"

This was by far my favorite part of the trip to Prague - we got to see some of the less touristy places, and enjoy a calm and comfortable bike ride out to the amazing Chateau Troja. I am terrible at biking, but Francesco kept us going a perfect pace. After the Chateau Troja we rode through a peaceful park, and then we climbed up a hill (I can't remember the name!) and were treated to some wonderful panoramic views of Prague. The trip was perfect - I strongly recommend this to everyone! I especially liked that Francesco perfectly balanced being informative and telling us what we were seeing with letting us relax and enjoy the ride! He was an amazing tour guide for sure, and if you choose to go on this tour you should definitely request him!Finally, we asked Francesco for a recommendation on where to eat dinner, and his recommendation was spot on. I can't say enough good things about this tour, so I'll stop now :)"

So I wanted a way to both see the sights and give my feet a rest while also getting some alternative exercise. My bike tour with Kat was just the ticket. I'd walked briefly around the old town the day before the tour, but Kat filled in the narrative on the 2.5 hour city tour. She also welcomed and answered every question I had about this exotic place. The pace was easy and she invited us all out for lunch afterwards nearby. The perfect last day of my 2 week trip to Europe."

            "review": "Best bicycle rental for riding Dresden to Prague (or other direction). Bicycle riding the Elbe River from Dresden to Prague is a great way to travel. Flat ground, mostly dedicated and paved cycle routes for slow cycling (as in slow food). Praha Bike rented the bikes, drove them to our pickup in Dresden, took all our heavy suitcases back with them, so it was a pannier-lite trip (the May weather cooperated as well... 85 degrees and sunny). Praha Bikes was great and the price was all-inclusive, so no surprises at the end. Two of our four of us purchased their own Bella Ciao bikes in Berlin (great bikes by the way) to fly home with them, and Praha Bikes kindly agreed to store these after the ride (Prague is a foot city, not bike friendly...too much traffic, no dedicated bike lanes, too many people, chunky cobblestones and compact enough to best be seen on foot), and they also offered to help them pack the bikes for the plane ride home... no extra charge. No guarantee that they will always offer this, but it was appreciated. Be sure to specify what you need and they will supply maps, recommended stopping, panniers, helmets, locks, etc.If you have a choice, don't ride Dresden to Prague, the direction we went, ride the other way. When the wind blows, going Dresden to Prague, it's in your face. Not only does the river run the other way (the drop is insignificant for biking) but so does the wind. The first day, it was a bit of chore... after that the wind stopped so for us it was a non-issue. Also, for the most part the Czech people on the road are more taciturn... reserved, not particularly animated or helpful. So if you start in Czech and go to Germany, each day gets better. By the time you get to Dresden, you have a most optimistic people who have done a most extraordinary turn-around since the wall fell. But this is a subtlety... either way is great. We allowed 35-50k per day so that we would ride about 3-4 hours with long midday stops for glorious lunches, exploring every castle, museum, great view or whatever came our way. This is slow-cycling at its best. One of us wore a helmet, but the others preferred the European way of wind in the hair. Given the slow speeds, no cars for most of the ride, and flat ground, it's very safe and a pleasure to ride bikes the old fashioned way.Our first night was in Bad Shandau, and in hindsight, I would recommend a shorter first day; spend the night in Pirna in Germany. Be sure to seek out Adoratio, the chocolate shop on the Main Square and buy more than you should. It lasted us the whole trip and was glorious. As can be expected, Germany was more refined than Czech, although it was clear that Czech is upgrading the roads. Some were still gravel, but some showing gravel on the map had just been paved. If you keep an eye out for the little yellow Bike Route 2 signs, you will not get lost.When you cross into Czech, the first big town is Usti. Do not stop, ride through and ignore it. It gives a horrible impression of the country, and one's immediate thought is that if this is Czech, skip the rest of the trip and take the train to Vienna. Don't give up hope, it gets much better. By Litomerice you fall in love with the architecture, the ancientness and the landscape.Must do: Dessert (or a full meal) outside the Melnik castle overlooking where the Elbe and Vltava rivers join. The views are stunning, the service and setting is five star with 17th century elegance. We did not discover it until after we had a late lunch on the main plaza, but it definitely is a must-return.The last full riding day, we ran into two German girls who were riding the full distance of Bike Route 2, all 500k of it. They had just come from Prague and said the first day riding out was difficult. Rough track. That night the weather changed, with a predicted drop from 88 degrees to 37 with cold rain, so we found the train station in Melnik and for the equivalent of a few dollars hopped a train that has racks for bikes and takes about a hour to do a day's ride into Prague. Thus, I cannot confirm what the first day's ride out of Prague is like.Prague was of course eye-achingly beautiful, as the architecture is just street after street of drop-dead beautiful, but unfortunately, the locals have not yet understood the concept of care and feeding of the visitor industry. Unlike the river ride, in Prague we kept getting the feeling we were lunch... we were there to be fleeced by the locals. A high price for a cup of bad coffee, and then we see the locals getting great coffee. This is typical of what happens when a country shifts from Communism to Capitalism, but it can be tiring. Having said that, there is a lot to do and English is spoken sufficiently that one need not learn Czech except for the basics to show one wishes to be polite. Of course, at Praha Bike their English was excellent. We found a great place to stay however (D\u016fm u velk\u00e9 boty (House at the Big Boot)), and the proprietor told us all the places the locals go where we would be treated right... he was right. Praha Bikes also offered to help us make those connections, so make friends and ask for help.Bottom line: Praha Bikes is highly recommended, as is the Elbe ride."

You do not need to be fit to do this cycle. My sister came with and the only time she rides a bike is on city breaks away and for her this was fine. The route has you following the main river through Prague and so very few hills are involved. The cycle is also leisurely and relaxing. You start at 9:30 and stop about 11 for a cool drink before continuing on to your final destination for arrival at about 1. Where you have lunch and when fully rested you walk the rest of the way to the Castle (15minutes max)You than get the 4o'clock train back to Prague and another final short cycle from the train station back to your starting point. Our guide was very friendly and kept the pace gentle.A great way to see more than just the city and a lovely way to spend a day. A family could do this and the kids will be nicely worn out at the end of the day :o)"

A big bike tour indeed!Our very friendly and knowledgeable guide Andres was fabulous. He showed us all the sights of Prague at a pace that was very manageable for both my friend and I. He has much in depth knowledge of Prague which he shared with us and showed us many sights both usual and unusual (including the hanging man and small narrow streets).Andres was very patient when we were taking photos and asking him questions and he gave us plenty of time to take in the beautiful sights of Prague. He even on more than one occasion, offered to take the photos of us both. The Big Bike Tour included lunch (with a beer!) then another beer later in the afternoon. I felt the organisation of the tour was well timed, with 3 -3 1/2 hours of cycling in the morning then the lunch stop, then another 3-3 1/2 hours cycling with another beer stop in one of the parks overlooking Prague. Lunch was very tasty with vegetarian options.All bike staff were very friendly and helpful and I would highly recommend this tour if you want very informative information of Prague and it's also a great way to get your bearings of the city to then go it alone. If you book on line you also get a discount off the advertised price. If you don't want to do a tour, they also rent bikes for a day but I'm not sure you'd see half as much as what we did, nor would you get the good commentary and information which Andres gave us.Thank you to all the staff at Praha Bikes, especially Andres for a great day out."

Cannot imagine if the chain broke - I doubt he would have any idea or the right tools. Second, he did not have the right change for the train on the return. I had to loan him the cash until we got back to the office. Maybe coming from a destination resort I expect more - in BC our guides would know their equipment, first aid etc. Buyer beware with this company."

First we did a late afternoon Panoramic Tour with Fortuna- our guide from Mexico, who is studying for her Masters degree in Prague. She was interesting, informative and fun. The Panoramic tour was for 2.5 hrs- great views of some of the back roads of the city, the John Lennon Wall, the Locks of Love, the castle with the \"changing of the guards,\" and the park, where we picked and ate some apples. Our second bike tour was a full day event, biking along the river and the countryside to the Karlstejn Castle. Our guide was the self-proclaimed \"sexy Frenchman\" Farid. He entertained us with his life stories and his take on Prague. The castle tour is more about taking a moderately intense bike ride for the day through the country. We stopped for a refreshing beer at a small biker's stand along the way and played fetch with the owner's dog. Then we rode another hour and had a delicious lunch. Our actual tour of the castle was ok. More enjoyable was our time with Farid, and meeting the other bikers. One of them ended up living 5 minutes from us back home. If you are looking for a tour with tons of history and information, this may not be for you. If you are looking for a fun, informal and informative guide who will show you the city and the countryside, then this is the perfect place to go."

From Republiky metro stop, walk north on Revolucni and turn left at Dlouha. We were the only two on the Classic City Tour, so got a customised version, which left out things we'd already seen and didn't want to see. Our guide was knowledgeable and helpful. He looked after us well, especially when changing lanes and at intersections. The 11.30am tour is an odd time so we gulped down our packed lunch at one of the many information/rest stops.Don't miss the pissing statues or the John Lennon wall; both on the western side of the river which is much quieter than the Old City side. Their mountain bikes are pretty well maintained, with suspension forks set soft for the cobblestone roads. The team-members behind the counter speak good English and are professional. But there's a guy in the courtyard who smokes, which is a bit off-putting - he keeps a little dog with him and may be the owner. We had a good time, saw plenty of the city in a short time and I think it was good value for money.PS Avoid the other company: City Bike Tours with the red and blue logo. We considered them, but the employees smoke around customers. So in spite of a glossy website AND facebook page, it's clear that they care more about promoting themselves than caring for their customers."

Unfortunately, our experience with Praha Bike tours (Praha Classic City Bike Tour) was on the poor side of the spectrum. While we did get to see quite a bit of the city, our guide was not very knowledgeable of the city. In fact, a few times we stopped we would get \"Do you know who/what that is?\"\u2026 pause for us to guess\u2026 \"No, no guess?\" And then he would proceed to tell us what we were staring at with little insight. I'm all for a little interaction, but we felt that the guide was just looking to fill the time at each stop. My husband and I were the only two on the bike tour (even though the guide rarely spoke to/looked at my husband\u2026) which I hoped would lead to some interesting discussion. Sadly I was mistaken. The end of the tour was strange as the guide stalled around us waiting for his tip. Maybe we caught them on a bad day, but our experience was bad enough for us not to do another ride with them."

I went there knowing it was one of the more expensive guides so expected better quality. Instead I received a guide with little in-depth knowledge on significant points in history, but more so, a tendency to lie whenever not knowing the full story. And often spending too much time on irrelevant stories rather than the beauty of the city. To top it off, my meeting with the owner wasn't positive, as he was arrogant and obnoxious. The guide also seemed to hint that they were much more taken advantage of, compared with the other tour guides who receive a larger percentage of the companies profits. I would recommend a free guided tour and renting a bike from somewhere cheaper!"

I'm not for the first time here, on the contrary, Two days waiting for my flight, I was just strolling on the Old Town Square glad that nothing changed at least here. Even a bike tour office I never favoured with a visit, driving bike in a city is a suicide!Nevertheless, I decided to take the tour, believing that by bike the guide can cover places of interest that are too far to reach by walking.Well, I was pleasantly surprised. I just walked in and joined a group of English sheduled as the next one.The bikes were in a good shape, apparently, just recently purchased. You can see on their web what they offer. All tours take around 2.5 hrs. I was afraid that the I would be dragged as a cattle by the guide who sure wants to finish ASAP. Contrary. our guide was a lovely Brasilian girl who lives in Prague and she knew the name of every brick and stone we were passing by. What is more important, I could see that it is natural for her to do the best that could be done. She was cordial and truly freindly, not in any way artificial. Im happy I took the tour. The price was fair and I received more than I have expected. Of course, a different guide could have turned this experiment into tragedy, but Michelle made sure that I not only felt relaxed, but I really saw a lot of things I had no idea about."

While it is true that biking is faster than walking, I would not recommend getting a bike for your stay and I would definitely not recommend getting a tour. The city just isn't that accomodating for bikers. There were no bike lanes and we frequently had to go between tourists who were walking. As for the tour, I'm sure other people had a better experience, but mine was rather poor. The first thing our guide told us was that he really didn't know much and that it was really a tour just to look. He was able to provide minimal information about the stops we took. Personally, I feel that if you are going to advertise a guided tour and have people pay for a guided tour, you should provide a tour guide who is able to tell more about the city. I didn't pay for a \"follow this guy around on a bike\" experience, I wanted to learn. I will say though that the guide did his best with a large group, some of whom were very inexperienced bikers."

This was not their first visit to Prague so I really wanted to do something a little different. We booked an extended private tour with a tour guide from Scotland called Sean. He had some great ideas for cycling routes around Prague, that took us out of the city and into the greenery that the city has to offer. I really enjoyed the tour and although there was nothing historical to discuss along our route, we all enjoyed the scenery and his sense of humour. A relaxing break from negotiations and a refreshing tour offering something different. On behalf of the tourgroup we would like to thank our guide and the staff at city bike for their service. If you want something a little different then I recommened taking a private tour and talking to them about some of the routes they can offer"

Luckily we had some cash, so we paid; however, that cash was intended to be used for other things, not the bike tour..Here is our experience:The route that Garmin took us was ridiculous and confusing. It took us into a 2 feet wide trail in the forest, and at one point there was a fork in the road and GPS had no clue which path. I was wondering..why was a forest trail even on the GPS? We chose the wrong fork and GPS finally alarmed.It also led us into a dead end, and then we had to carry our bike down the hill to continue in the street..I'm not lying, it was so weird.GPS told us to turn left where the road was steeper, just to get back on the same road.Took us into a unnecessary detour to Morina, where we spent hour pushing our bike up because we could not ride it due to the steepness! Turns out, it was a wrong direction.GPS clearly malfunctioned and they blamed it on an operator error. Perhaps there was some operator error; however, how is it acceptable business for the GPS to cause such a major issue? What should have taken 2.5 hours took us 5 hours.We finally got to the castle but did not get to see it.Workers were rude and un-apologetic."

Also we were not informed at intake that there was an max. weight for a childrens seat. So we had to book 2 tandems. In stead of one.

Went back a couple of days later to hire bikes for a couple of hours & rode along the river to get away from the hustle of the town. Would recommend :o)"

We've done city bike tours in Barcelona, Budapest, and Vienna and this one was the best because our guide ,Martin, was so knowledgeable about every site and had a number of entertaining anecdotes. It was about 2.5 hours and covered the city area. Great way to get an orientation to the city."

Decided to explore the city by bikes.Rented Electric bikes from City Bike for full day (6-7 hours) with GPS.GPS helped us to navigate to the places to see. This GPS have a tour Map of places to see in the city. It was a great experience and fun way of exploring the city. They have very good electric bikes and GPS was also good. Our trip gone very well but at time of returning bikes a very unhappy issue happened. The locks of the bikes have 2 keys,1 they give to you and 1 they keep with themselves. I returned the key,they opened the lock and put it inside office but then they started telling me that I did not returned key & they opened the lock by their own so there is 1 key lost. And if it is lost I have to pay money for new lock because a key can't be made for such locks. I repeatedly was telling them I did not lost & returned to you, we told them to double check and then my friend also gone inside the office and suddenly they came to me saying sorry that we found it,it was just misplaced like that. I really don't know if it was a mistake or Intentionally trapping act, but my advice to people is that while returning bikes & other stuff to the company be alert & make sure what you are returning.So that no such issues happen. I am giving 4 stars to City Bike Prague only due to this reason, however I recommend \"City Bike Prague\" to other people."

City Bike was everything I wanted and MORE. City Bike is a MUST for a bicycle tour of Prague. I was greeted at the City Bike office by Pavel, who in addition to being extremely good looking, was polite and managed to squeeze us into a nearly full tour. Our tour guide, Marissa (who you should definitely request), was amazing: kind, knowledgeable, an excellent cyclist. She calmly and eloquently relayed the entire history of Prague and the Czech Republic while gracefully cycling for two hours over cobblestone and up hills. The tour was riveting, exciting, fast... but Marissa also tailored to those less bicycle-savvy, and was willing to slow down for several Americans in the back of the group. Overall, the company seems to be flexible when it comes to its customers. So, Pavel, Marissa- thank you for making my experience in Prague the BEST it could have possibly been. City Bike is a fantastic company and should be recommended to all those coming to Prague!"

My friends and I have taken several bike tours in cities in Europe, and while this one was shorter (2 hours), it still gave a great overview of the city and allowed us to get our bearings of Prague. City Bikes Prague seems less established than other bike tour companies in Europe, but our tour guide (Emmanuel) was still informative, knowledgeable, personable, and gave great suggestions. The city is a little more difficult to navigate (more cobblestones, no bike paths) but it is still worthwhile!"

Its helpful to the rest of the group if you get there 15 mins early to get that sorted. The 2 hr 15 min tour was a flat ride which is suitable or all levels of fitness. Cobblestones added an element of fun and the sections on road felt safe despite some traffic (especially as we had a city bike employee riding at the back of the pack to ensure everyone was ok). Emmanuel was a great guide - offering just the right amount of culture, history and photo stops. This was a great start to our stay in Prague and we would highly recommend it."

She gave us a brochure and told us about the walking tour that she was offering. She told us that she would have smaller groups than the tour that we had booked. Man, was she right! Our tour started 15 minutes after we met, and it turned out that we were the only two people on the tour, so we had her all to ourselves! When we started our tour, she asked if there was anything specific that we were interested in. I told her that I was very interested in Prague's recent history - WWII and communism in particular. With that, we started our tour and she took us by many sites significant to WWII and communism, along with all the usual Prague landmarks. Her knowledge of Prague and its history was exceptional - there wasn't a single question that she didn't have an answer for. Diana is a wealth of knowledge and information about Prague. She is super friendly, kind, and you can tell right away that she has a good heart. We were so thoroughly impressed with her that we booked a second tour with her for that afternoon of Prague castle. Again, she was great! There was no rushing, and she made sure that we took our time and saw everything that we wanted to see.Our walking tours with Diana were definitely the highlight of our trip to Prague, and we are grateful to her for making our trip so memorable! During our tour, we saw many other walking tours where there were 10 or 20 or more people on the tour. We felt sorry for them! It would be difficult to hear the guide in a group that big. If you want to take a tour of Prague, I can't recommend City Bike Prague and Diana in particular strongly enough. Smaller groups, super knowledgeable staff, and guides with kind hearts. What more could you want? Thank you Diana!"

Having been given bad directions and missing the start of the other tour I was given a flyer by someone in the street and went at the appointed time to the City Bike venue.This service was half the price of the other company so suited my budget better. Surprisingly on what was a nice day they had no other takers so I ended up having a personalised tour.Whilst I rate this service very highly I would throw in a few points. I was not offered a helmet, although they have them and I would not have used it. I was also not offered my free drink.I think they will do pretty much anything you want but you may need to ask. For the money I would say very good value and if like me you can get the leaflet from someone in the street you may find that you get it at a discount."

Basically it started pouring about 45 minutes into the 3 hour or so tour and everyone in the group wanted to stop.

I decided to rent a bike from them and upgraded to one of their nicer Trek mountain bikes. One might assume that bikes are a bad idea in a city with so much cobble stone, but there was nothing my bike couldn't handle! The suggestions and the routes the guys at the shop gave me were terrific, especially the beer garden with the amazing view of the castle, called Riegrovy Sady in Zizkov! The service was great, the bike tour was fun and informative, the bike provided everything I needed for my time there... bottom line, you just cannot go wrong with a visit to City Bikes if you're in Prague.

I tend to like doing a bike tour on my first day in a city because it allows me to see a bunch of the highlights quickly and then I can go back to what I find especially interesting so I've taken quite a number of them. They are generally pretty good but even compared to other solid bike tours, the City Bike tour in Prague that I took a few weeks ago was truly exceptional. Our guide was Deanna and she knew the history of Prague as well as all of the sights backwards and forwards but also had a way sprinkling in lots of really interesting anecdotes and stories. She also gave us great suggestions on where to get some excellent food and drink after the tour. As to another reviewer's complaint about there being actual people in a city (the horror!!!), I can only say that I was there on a fairly busy day and did not find it particularly difficult to ride thorough plazas without mowing down other pedestrians. Overall this was an experience that I would highly recommend to anyone visiting Prague."

One of the places they recommended we go to a place called \"Czech Paradise,\" about an hour and a half train ride outside the city where there were some nice castles and we saw a bunch of other riders--mainly Czechs, I'd assume--riding out there. Prague's beautiful, but it was awesome to get a more authentic experience of the countryside, too.

The bikes were comfortable and a joy to ride, and we would both want to come back and give the other tours the guys have to offer a go. Again could not recommend this more to anyone, regardless of who they're with. You're thoroughly looked after, you gain a wealth of knowledge about the city, and it's a real joy to do something so efficiently and effortless for a lot of satisfaction."

Although from Portugal, emmanuelle had an amazing insight and depth of local historical knowledge, I'm still recalling the endless amount of sights and information he shared on our 2hr trip.. It was a brilliant introduction to Prague as nothing i had pre-read about the city had filtered in as easily as on this insightful tour. The bike was a brand new rock machine which made the whole tour thoroughly comfortable and enjoyable. I look forward to coming back with my family and going on this tour again, but for longer."

The staff there was super friendly and even despite the drizzling weather, we had a blast on our tour with Diana. She didn't bore us with long winded historical lectures, but pointed out the important places and had interesting stories to accompany the sites. Prague is a beautiful city, and I'm so happy that we first explored it on bike. We got to hit all the major \"must sees\" of Prague and then some other bizarre places that we never would have been able to find on our own. Diana even gave us recommendations of some of her other favorite places in the city so we were able to go explore after our tour. I highly recommend City Bike for anyone visiting Prague!"

I would recommend the tour in the beginning of your visit to the city- you'll get a feel for the city and then know what you want to go back to visit later in your stay in Prague. They offered a variety of bikes (beach cruisers, mountain bikes, pedal brakes/ handle breaks, etc., which was a nice option and we were thrilled when they offered us a tour even though they were closed for the season. Very good customer service. The tour was roughly 43euros plus tip for the guide. A great use of your money!"

We went on the morning tour which no one else had booked on so had our own guide (Megan) and effectively own private tour. We covered about 7 miles in 2 hours and thoroughly enjoyed the tour. We booked through an agent who advertise in the hotel whose description states \"free drink and bike tour\" the free drink didn't happen which didn't disappoint us but City Bikes should correct this in the advert. I would recommend at a weekend going on the first tour as the city quickly gets packed with tourists which as the crowds increased, cycling become slower and trickier. Megan was knowledgeable and amenable and amended the tour to suit us to cover more ground and see more sites with shorter descriptions at each stop. You need to ask for a helmet as they do not assume you want to wear one. Check the fit before you leave as mine had a faulty clip and kept loosening - I shudder to think if the helmet would have helped in an accident! The bike was in good condition and there was a choice of bike types. Book direct with City Bikes and pay the little extra for a private tour to suit your cycling confidence and expectations of a city tour."

We were lucky enough to have a mix and did a half and half (ask for that if you're interested in both). Our guide was fun and very knowledgeable of the sights he showed us (I love learning the history of things I see). He was also knowledgeable of sights we just pointed at along the route. This was a very relaxed and very fun tour. Also, the guide was in no rush and the tour went longer than expected (though he asked if it was OK for everyone if that happened). I read another review about an Auzziie tour guide that sucked. I can't speak for that. Ask for the guy from California :)"

A city bike tour is always a good way to learn to know a city because you can do quite some distance on a short time and have a good idea of what is to see (or not) in a city. If you can do this with help of a guide then we are in favourite and we have done this in Berlin, Vienna, Sydney , Budapest etc. In case of Prague it was a short ride (2u) compared with other cities(mostly 3-4u) . The reason is that centre of Prague is compact (so no big distances) and by that some places not feasible due to too many tourists. The ride as such was good , with a guide who speaks perfectly English but at the same time disappointing since he was not a Czech and we missed the local touch. The bikes were of good quality but the price was high (22Euro/person) compared with duration and experience in other cities. We stopped to have a beer and paid ourselves (also for the guide), afterwards I saw on their website that a free drink was included. The price of 3 beers (3 euro) was cheap but nevertheless we felt a bit cheated."

We spent the day on the outer parts of the centre going stopping off in the many parks to take in the view and relax. We spent the afternoon by heading out along the river where there is a great cycle path and we stumbled upon a music festival where we had a great time. Without the bikes it would just not have happened. We then had to race back as we knew the shop closed at 6.45 and were just a couple of minutes late but we were greeted with smiles and they even spent a bit of time giving us information.

I'm not sure of his name but he's from New Jersey (I believe) and was very professional in both his manner and presentation. He knew a lot about the historical significance of each thing we visited and we particularly enjoyed his coverage of the Jewish Ghetto as we were planning to visit again later on our own. Unfortunately there was a very immature Aussie on the tour who decided to try and do some fancy moves with these touring bikes and in so doing, he ruined the bike frame of his bike. We then all had to wait for someone from the office to ride out to where we were with another bike for him to use. Other than that, very good tour and a great way to get quickly acquainted with the main sights of Prague."

He was fun and charismatic and full of knowledge about the area. We ticked off so many sights off our list and left knowing what we were going to explore further and just how we were going to do it, from trams to nightlife to day trips. Touring with Harry was like having an old friend bring you about his favourite city and he gave us a fantastic start to our trip. I particularly liked the John Lennon wall and listening to a busker play here comes the sun and leaving our mark on the wall.We do a bike tour in every city we are in and this is the first time I have felt strongly enough to write a review. A great tour and fantastic value for the length of the tour also. Cheers Harry"

For several years now my family and I make a bike tour of each city we visit a priority. It is a fantastic way to see learn about a city. We do this early in our stay so we can learn about what we want to explore in further detail. If the tour guide is good, you will learn the history and highlights of the city, and the best spots for dining, dancing, or anything that interests you. I have toured 9 cities this way and Sean provided one to he best. He is quite a colorful character initially from Scotland. He is well read and quite knowledgable about Prague's history. He was able to answer most of the questions we had when we were wanted to go deeper into a topic. To his credit, he did not hesitate to let us know what he didn't know. I've had guides just make stuff up. Did I mention that Sean was entertaining?"

            "review": "City Segway tour. After doing a Segway in Budapest with yellow zebra, we decided to do another one in Prague. We chose the superior tour which is 3 hours plus a few minute for training. I would recommend this tour but would also recommend the 3hr tour. Damn now the Gilligan's Island song is stuck in my head... Anyway it was a great tour and way to to see the four sections of the city. In the extra hour of the superior tour we did get to see some of the bohemian \"hippy art\" (as Americans would see it it) including the Lennon wall graffiti and the \"pee'ing statues\" which was really cool. I will say if you are doing a Viking riverboat cruise from either direction, you should definitely do a yellow zebra Segway tour. But book only one and take the tour then you get a discount on the other of 20% which is well worth it. We took Budapest and then booked the Prague tour after when we got the booking code. I have found this is the case with Segway tour operators that are chains or have sister company's in multiple cities. Two things that would have made this better is if they would have had radios with the guide telling about the area and history. If felt more like a motorized sight seeing tour with just a little history lesson. I have been on some tours in which the guide just wouldn't shut up and put you into information overload. Don't get me wrong we did get some info on the site but not S much as I would have liked. It could be just the guide as well. I'm not sure but it was fun nevertheless. The other thing is they left the Segways in \"turtle\" mode meaning they were speed limited to 1/2 of the normal speed. This did make it hard to ride in some areas cause the Segway would kick back on you. But they turned it off on the 3rd hour. Much better and easier!The shop is kind of hard to find and there is not a visible signage pointing you in the right direction. Also if you get to the main square you will see lots of Segways with people trying to sign you up for a tour. We couldn't find the office but finally asked one of these guys who pointed out the yellow zebra rep a few feet away and he walked us to the office. Also there is not a restroom at this office so you are on your own but they will stop if you tell the guide. I would definitely do again but might opt to pay a little more for the private tour at this location. One other thing I will mention is this is a crowed city with walkers and cobble stone walkways/roads will give your knees a workout. I suggest taking some Alive before and after or have cocktails afterwards to help you relax :)"

It was a terrific way to see around this wonderful city on our first full day here. We were taken to Old Town , New Town, Lesser Town and the Jewish Quarter. The bikes were in excellent condition and obviously well looked after with optional baskets on the front for those who wanted. My husband and I were the only customers on this particular tour so Harry personalised it quite a bit for us, including the chiming of the astronomical clock at midday and a stop off for a cold beer before we returned. Harry was full of historical knowledge about all the sites we stopped at, as well as many others we passed along the way. He was able to link up many of the artistic, religious and political aspects for us since we knew nothing of the area or its history. He also gave us many recommendations about breweries and restaurants to try, as well as suggestions for accessing more sites during the remainder of our stay."

Our guide, Artuhr, was very helpful, informative and funny which made the tour just perfect. He showed us how to handle the segways before our tour and made us feel save. While explaining many interesting facts about Prague to us, he also made it possible to see very much of the city (which was maybe also due to us being the only two people on the tour). Thank you for a wonderful tour through historic and beautiful Prague - what a fun way of getting to know a lot of the city!"

Our guide - Nick was so nice and friendly that he made our tour more memorable by his knowledge of places he took us and his patience to stop by at several places to take pictures. He took our group of 5, to all around the canal, bridge, old city, town square, and many other places with historic importance. He was very cautious of our safety while crossing the roads, downhill, uphill. Overall, a lovely segway tour!!!"

Firstly, the location of the office was right next to our rented apartment (which was located in the ideal spot between the old and new city), so getting there was easy. Dominik then gave us some general pointers before letting each person try on their own for a mini lesson. We then set off to the main park of the city where we saw beautiful views and were given more freedom on the segways. It was wonderful because Dominik let us roam around freely, but under the right amount of control so there was no feeling of danger. He was a funny and informative tour guide. Would definitely recommend this place. While we only had one tour guide we met some of the others in the office and they seemed just as cool and knowledgeable. Segways are awesome and easy to ride so if you want to try in Prague, go to THIS place !"

Segways are great fun and an awesome way to get around the city quickly.We managed to haggle a bit on price and paid 900CZK per person for a 1 hour tour.Our tour guide was nice, but his English was a little lacking. We requested a bit of a 'custom' route having seen much of the old city before and he was accommodating to this. However, it did feel as though a lot of his knowledge was around the old town rather than the other side of the river which was the part we were interested in. Indeed, we wanted to see some things on the Castle-side of the river, but the guide didn't even mention them (the peeing men, for example).A nice touch was that the guide carried gloves around, which came in handy as it can get a bit chilly zooming around on the Segway.Overall, a pleasant experience, but nothing to write home about."

Our original plan was to find our trip advisor researched seller, however, in the main square there were Segway sellers everywhere!!! Wheeling up to you and pushing their tour. One such seller we asked how much for a private 3 hour tour. He quoted \u20ac79 and we haggled down to \u20ac59. We accompanied him to his base and off we went. Our tour guide at first was really credible. His English was good and he was really attentive, making sure we were happy etc. As the tour progressed he kept stopping at shops, asking us if we wanted water. Although believe real reason was so he could purchase a can of beer. Not a problem for us in the beginning but after four cans, the joke started to wear a little thin. While the tour was exactly designed to our modification - less speak more Segway. We all believe the drink started to impact the quality of the tour. Not an issue of the company, but very clear segways are not liked by the locals. Probably because of the small pavements in places, especially across the bridges. While on road, one of our party was nearly knocked off by a taxi - later told by guide that taxis view segways as competition. By the time we got back to base we were looking forward to the end as the guide was getting a bit 'loud' and was not shy at expressing his views on most things. All in all the tour was what we wanted and not spoilt by our guide. I'm sure it would have been different if not for the alcohol consumption. Recommend you haggle to secure the best deal. If using a Segway for a first time (our fifth time) it would appear that the Czechs are not big on all the health and safety stuff. As sellers are letting people have a go and try in the main squares."

The tour company has a great route chosen which is pretty easy for anyone, but there is one hill ( I don't typically do hills and I made it fine). The guide (Greg) was really fabulous. He had lots of interesting history, stories and personal insight to share. He is American, but has lived in Prague long enough to really learn what interests people. We saw the usual highlights as well as a few places/sights we would never have found on our own. Based on this tour, it is much easier to chose what we want to spend our time exploring more in depth. I would put this activity as a must do for a first time Prague visitor."

Really enjoyed seeing Prague from a bicycle - and the bikes were nothing to complain about (upgraded to the bigger ones instead of the yellow bikes). Our guide Sean was the best ever - his Scottish (I assume) humor made the trip really fun (he speaks frank fluently ;-) ) and he also makes the group become a part of the tour in a stand up comedy way - not to mention he knows all relevant historic facts and other."

He was knowledgable about all the sights and was even patient and answered with all the questions I had. However, the main thing I would like to say is that although I also fell off and/or wrecked the Segway 5 or 6 times Albers saved me each time! It was actually quite cold this day even with the sunshine, so after about an hour (when I was doing quite well balancing and driving the Segway) I couldn't feel my toes so my balance was completely thrown off. But, like I said, each time Albers slowed me down, guided me down the hills, and helped me to get my balance back. Although I will probably never ride another Segway again, I had a great time segwaying around Prague with Albers :)"

We had 4 Aussies doing a beer and food tour with Sean through Discover Prague and we couldn't have had a better time!Immediately upon meeting Sean had our group gauged and fit in well with the banter we had going. He was always ready with a laugh and made us all feel at ease as we took to the streets to start our beer tour!First stop was the beer museum (entry included in our tour) where Sean's knowledge of the beer brewing process and the Czechs involvement shone through. This bloke obviously knows his stuff! It was great having a guide to chat with and ask questions of (Sean readily answered all queries!) rather than just reading an overload of info. We had 4 beer tastings at the museum before moving on to stop number 2!After having a few beers at the museum I seem to have forgotten the name of our next stop but that's not to say I didn't thoroughly enjoy myself there! We sat down to another beer (our group was getting into the unfiltered beers - so tasty!) and a delicious plate of Czech beer snacks! We had sausage, cheese, pickles, more sausage, jellied pork and fried bread which we rubbed garlic onto. Needless to say we cleaned it up pretty quick ;)Sean then introduced us to a very tasty beer concoction that was a mix of dark and light beer- which also went down way too easy!Needless to say we finished off the tour feeling pretty good. A very enjoyable night with a fantastic guide. Na zdravi Sean!"

There are plenty of Segway operators in Prague (you will see when you visit), but this company in my opinion offers the best tour and service. Other tour operators operate with bigger groups, or tiny Segways, this company offers the real deal, the big original Segways. We were asked in the old town if we had taken a Segway tour by a very nice guy called Randal who then let us have a go on his Segway, this gives you the confidence you will be able to Segway for the tour. We then decided we would do the tour the next morning, so we were taken to the office to leave a 10-20% deposit. We would recommend that you do this in the morning as there are fewer people so you can get further. On the morning we met our tour guide Ita Weber, who was a real star! Very friendly, always smiled and very helpful! She discussed the route with us and off we went. In two hours we went up to Letna park, around to the castle, up to Petrin hill and finally back to the office. I would definitely do the tour again. Thanks Yellow Zebra and in particular Randal and Ita!"

Although this was our last day and we've been to most tourist attraction places around Prague, we wanted go on the segways properly so said yes to a short half an hour tour. Daniel was our guide and he was fantastic - really smiley and friendly. He asked in the beginning whether we want it to be a riding segway based or a historical information based tour so we asked for a balanced one with a bit more riding. He took us to the powder tower (one I asked to go to) then along the river - the view was awesome with the sunset. He talked a bit about all the attraction places we could see riding down the bank and also told us myths and old tales about them and my friend and I found those really interesting and funny. Then he quickly took us around the Jewish town too, which was very nice because we didn't know about it at all! We only asked for 30 minutes of tour, so it ended very quickly, but this unplanned tour was an amazing way of summing up our Prague trip. Thank you to Daniel and I definitely would recommend going on it for at least a 30 minutes during your stay in Prague. (and plus, those segways are really easy and fun to ride!)"

We booked a group tour which was due to start at 9:30am but unfortunately we missed it because we were stuck in very bad traffic. We didn't let it ruin our day, instead we wandered around and did our own thing until after lunch. Then we decided to find the place and see if we could book another tour.Navigation is not my strongest skill so we did struggle to find the place but we got there in the end and explained why we missed our tour and the man behind the desk said we could book another tour with no charge but unfortunately due to our time restrictions for other activities none of the times suited so we paid for a private tour which we could do immediately. While we were arranging the new tour one of the staff had been speaking Czech with the man behind the desk and then suddenly starting speaking Scottish which was great for me also being Scottish, he kept us occupied while the booking was set up and our tour guide arrived. Our tour guide was Anna Duralova (I'm not sure if I have spelled the surname correctly). She was a fantastic tour guide; spoke great English, very friendly and knowledgeable, trained us on the Segway before we set off and gave us clear expectations of how the tour would go (we had to stay in a line for safety, keep a few feet distance between each person, stay slow in the town center and she would stop at attractions / landmarks and give us the history of each one). We set off and she looked back frequently to ensure we hadn't got lost or fell off and helped us when we were struggling to control the Segway when going downhill.The Segway was the best way to see so many things in a short time, we went zooming past people and learned about the history of Prague while having a great time even though it was just the 2 of us with our guide. Highly recommend segway tours from Yellow Zebra Segways and Bikes!Thank you Anna!"

Flexible and very accommodating. Helmets and locks are already included in the tour fee. Don't forget to choose Sean from Glasgow who gave us a fun-filled and colorful history of Prague's finest. Up to you, but we decided to get some breaks during the tour so extending the tour is not a huge problem. However I will need to recommend that if you're into bike tours, water, food and 1st aid kit are must bring to make it hassle-free."

The first taken bike was small for me, and a guy was not happy to replace it (he had studied a family on segways in the yard). Since the bikes are unorganized, the issue was difficult.Uncomfortable ride a bicycle on a cobbled street, and the wheels was not pumped enough. The tyres are with something inside to protect the wheel in case of puncture. So, the combination of the low pressure, cobbled streets and this feature of the tyres was really annoying. Seems the bicycles are not a priority of this rental point."

The only negative things I would says out our tour is that we didn't get as much detail about the history and the culture as I would have liked, although I recognize I'm a history buff. And the day before, when we had made the tour arrangement with Daniel who found us in the Old Town Square, he had promised us a private tour and we agreed to it. Apparently, he forgot to tell that agreement to the main office. We truly had a lovely time with the other couple from Australia. And, as I said, Albert was a wonderful guide.

(think I will do this in Athens and Vienna next) Prague was so much fun to see in this way, just perfect way to explore all the cobbled back streets and speed up hills and through the beautiful parks (not many limitations). I could not believe how easy these were to master, very manoeuvrable and anyone could use these. We were with our 60yrs old mother and she was concerned if she could do it but before we knew it she was constantly on the tail of our guide leading the group. We chose a 90 minute tour but wish it was the two hour, they are addictive as you cover so much ground with ease. It's best to make use of their hill climbing capabilities so we chose to go up to the castle and we also visited the Petrin tower, wonderful views from that height!Our tour guide Anna was a very pleasant sweet lady, very knowledgable on the history of Prague and told us some interesting facts. She was new to the company so I think she is still getting used to getting around the town and at times it would of been better if we could of taken less busy tourist routes or back streets but I understand that you have to choose routes with less steps and curbs though I must say I was impressed how these machines can climb and bump over fairly chunky curbs. Overall it was a brilliant way to do an express tour of the city. This company was very professional, good equipment and one of their charming reps called Danielle stopped us in the main square, gave us a chance to demo the Segway then gave us a good reduced price for our tour. No annoying hard sell techniques but I suppose once you try these Segways, they sell themselves. Thanks for an enjoyable morning, btw I think it's better if you can plan to do an early morning tour as streets are less busy therefore better for you to appreciate the scenery."

It started off with a thorough briefing by the manager of what the tour included and the appropriate signing of the waiver and disclaimer form which is the norm when one engages in tour activities such as diving, kayaking, etc. What followed was the introduction on how to use the equipment (the Segway) and to familiarize and get first timers like us to use this accordingly. What we truly appreciated was the concern for the guests by the manager and tour guide Anna Durajova, when it came to the children with us who were to use the Segway as well. They took their time and did not rush any of us in learning / familiarizing ourselves with the Segway and took more time with one of us who had initially had difficulties using it. They were supportive and encouraging and helped the person's confidence in using it. As a result of this concern, our group of 9 persons had the most enjoyable, pleasurable, memorable and informatively unique way of seeing the breathtaking sights of Prague. At all times our guide Anna was professional, yet friendly and congenial and always demonstrated concern for our safety while ensuring we saw the best of the city and made sure we all were having a great time doing so. Seeing the city with this tour company is a MUST for all tourists, and if possible, to request for anna as their guide as she was the one who made it as enjoyable and fun and informative and safe for us first timers. Will definitely book with the same company when we visit Vienna in a few days. Worth every dollar spent."

It did not take long at all to get used to the Segways, and our tour guide Ita made us feel comfortable, knowing when to give information, and give me and my girlfriend some distance to enjoy the scenery together. Overall, great fun, a good way to get around the city!"

Defo a must visit again... I rly reckon to get started w tour w her as you will know what to do after , where to go for a beer or grab a bite to eat.."

We saw so much of the city in the 90 minute tour and we could tailor the tour to what we wanted to see which meant we didn't have to see things we had already seen. The price was very reasonable and our tour guide (Honza) was fantastic - he knew the answer to all of our questions, told us the best and cheapest places to eat, drink, shop and party and told us some very unique and funny stories! Honza had an incredible knowledge of the city which really helped us - if anything I would recommend doing this tour at the start of your visit to Prague so that then you know what to do and where to go for the rest of your tripWe had such a fantastic time!"

We choose a 2 hour tour as we wanted to get the most form the experience and thins is by far the most exciting thing I have done. ita was very patient with us when we slowed down to look at things and even gave us time to get off the segways and have a look at things.I would recommend having a go and with this company is a must.

Yes it's a bit pricey but to travel almost 13 miles in 2 hours, it's a great way to get your bearings and cheat a bit on the hills. I recommend you do this in the early part of your trip so you know where to go back to. I will say, I thought I would give my tired legs a break from walking but what I forgot is that you are standing the entire time. I easily found the guides in the old square because of their blue shirts. There a few companies that offer this tour but I liked the personality of Kiara so I chose her. As luck would have it, she was available and since there was no one else interested in a ride, I got a private tour for the group price. I told her I had been to Prague before so I wanted to hear what she had to say about the city. Her take on it. Her favorite places, etc. For me, it was easy to learn and before long I was calling myself a professional. I admit at times it was hard to maneuver around all the people walking and sometimes they got mad at us, not for cutting them off but for just being there. I made sure to say thank you if they moved out of the way. When going downhill I was a little tentative but Kiara was a great teacher. If I wanted to stop and take a picture, she was happy to oblige. Overall, I had a great time, exploring the city and seeing it from a different perspective. Plus it was fun."

We were met at the hotel, given a lesson for 10 minutes (neither of us had ever been on one before) and then on our way. The guide, Peter, took us to lots of places we would not have bothered going to, but glad we did. The Segway allowed us to cover a lot of ground - quickly. Two hours cost A$90 ea. incl. the guided tour. This is a quality tourist operation and worth every cent. Next time I am bringing the whole family back to do it."

Touring the town via Segway was also a great choice - not only very practical, but gliding about was a blast. Being a private tour (reasonably priced, too), we were able to pick our destinations, and so we toured the park overlooking the river on the west side of Prague. I can highly recommend this - beautiful views of the city and would be quite a long hike without the Segway. It was our first time on Segways, and we were a bit tentative at first, but in 5 minutes we felt much more natural. David was very good with his instruction and always kept an eye on us through the city and cruising through the park's pathways. He was also very good at fielding all my questions about the modern history of the Czech Republic, and was very thoughtful and insighful. Thanks to David - can highly recommend!"

My wife, 12 yr old granddaughter and I arrived May 7, 2013, checked into our hotel and immediately went to iSegway Prague Tours for our 3.5 hour tour of Prague. After an one minute demonstration of how to operate the Segway, we where off wheeling down the streets and up the many hills of Prague. Looking back, this had to be the most perfect way to begin our trip-seeing and learning about all the sites of Prague in ease while we witnessed other tourist struggling with the cobblestone roads and numerous hills. Now we plan to visit the sites that appeal to us knowing we won't be waiting precious time since we are here for only 3 days. David, our tour guide was just great- Very good English, knowledgeable, polite, easy going and kept a very watchful eye on us to ensure we were safe, etc. FYI- our granddaughter never wanted the tour to end, having a blast on the Segway. Enjoy Prague."

Our guide, Domink, quickly put our fears to rest, showing us quickly and easily how to master the Segway. He safely took us throught the crowded streets of old Prague, over the river to the comanding heights of a park for spectacular views of the city. We then went to the castle for more great views and into the old town below the castle and to the famous John Lennon wall. We wound our way through the city back over the bridge, seeing many interesting old and new sites. Dominik offered excellent commentary the whole way. Particularly if you have limited time in Prague, the Segway tour gets you around quickly...what we saw in 2 hours would have taken 6-8 if we had walked. ISegway delivered a great experience at fair price...we'd do it again!"

We did this tour in winter and so it was not too crowded on the streets but I would imagine using Segways on crowded roads and pavements at the height of the season would detract from the enjoyment. As it was we managed to cover 2 or 3 times the ground we could have on foot in the same time. Not cheap but fun.Be prepared for some hostility from some pedestrians (locals) who seem to regard Segways with contempt. We met one who deliberately steeped into the guides way and refused to move. He gave her a stream of abuse before she managed to calmly placate him. Full marks to her for maintaining civility. There are a number of firms offering Segways but this seemed the most reasonable. They will barter on cost out of season."

There are many Segway companies to choose from in Prague, but we chose ISegway, due to their location and being able to accommodate our specific requests. More on that later. Their location couldn't be any better. It's just inside the Art Passage almost on top of Old Town Square, near the Astronomical Clock. In fact, we stumbled onto to it while walking through. Glad we did, as we never considered riding a Segway before. We had seen many other Segway companies in Prague, but chose (ISegway) after meeting Jakub walking through the passage. He was super nice, and talked to us about their individual structured tours which I believe are 1-3 hours in length. We wanted something a little different and preferred a little extra attention. For example, instead of just seeing all the main tourist sites like, the Jewish Quarter, Charles Bridge, Prague Castle, and Kampa Island (and obviously-Old Town Square), we wanted to see Prague from a native perspective. A person who has a rich history of the city, and has extensive knowledge of the local restaurants and pubs. When we travel, we like to go were the locals go. So, Jakub accommodated us by giving us a custom-2-hour tour of Prague. It was the most memorable experience we've had of any vacation to date. It was fantastic!Plus, you don't have to worry about killing your feet on the cobblestones while walking throughout Prague. And, the Segway literally glides along the pathways with ease and little effort, therefore the higher elevations of Prague are no match. Worried about safety? We were too! No need though, because ISegay provided all the safety gear and training you need (in this case, just helmets, and a camera :)) We were up and running in no time flat. Actually, we're still surprised how easy it was, and may even purchase one (Segway) for ourselves at Christmas.One thing to remember, be sure and bundle up, as it can get quite cold. We took our tour at the right time (between 1-3 pm), but we were prepared. It wasn't that bad at all, but it gets dark around 4:30, so be sure and keep that in mind. All in all, one of the best experiences we've ever had. Thanks, Jakub! Sincerely,Kevin"

Jacob, a native of Praha and one of the owners, was my guide. As he grew up in town, he's very knowledgeable of the areas to tour and can tell you about how the city has evolved over the past 30 years. They have mapped routes but are happy to deviate from the norm to customize your visit. After a quick learning and practice session (I had never been on a Segway before) I spent several hours traveling through the city and even stopped for lunch together upon my request. The advantage of seeing a city on Segway over an off/on bus tour is that you can stop anywhere, even if it's just to read a plaque or look at a statue. This company is all about satisfying the guest's interests coupled with safe-riding. If you are hesitant in spending the money required to tour, don't be. I saw so much of a new city without the normal fatigue from a day a walking. It's great!"

We felt like our tour was perfectly personalized based on our interests and desire to see the \"local\" side of Prague. Our tour took us away from the main attractions and to lovely neighborhoods, parks, cafes/restaurants, history etc. Michal is very knowledgable and passionate about Prague, and we really enjoyed hearing all about Prague's history and culture from him. He shared great stories about his family, and his commentary really enhanced our experience and understanding of Czech culture.The day of our tour was very rainy, and I was very worried that the bad weather would negatively impact our afternoon. That was not the case as our indoor stops were perfectly timed with the sporadic downpours. We didn't miss out on anything thanks to Michal's great planning and flexibility. I highly recommend booking time with Michal on the front end of your trip. We learned so much about the city, and the amount of information he shared (about Prague's history, must-visit restaurants and museums, where to find meaningful souvenirs, best strategies for visiting major attractions, etc) was invaluable. I can't imagine a better way to cover ground, and learn about Prague, than by bike with Michal. :)"

As the guide books say, you need to get out of Prague to really experience what the Czech Republic is all about. We have travelled in many places & Michal is undoubtedly the best guide we have ever had. He not only told us about the history but his own feelings about living under the rule of the Russians. After our bike ride he took us to a bar/restaurant on the top of a department store and pointed out all the sites in the city of Prague that we needed to visit. This included cafes, restaurants, jazz bars etc. and he marked them all on the map for us. We visited all of them & they were wonderful. Thank you Michal for a wonderful tour.

The views were incredible! We avoided the large tourist qeues and had plenty of time to explore the castle grounds, royal gardens and went into the cathederal. We had lunch in a beautiful little cafe hidden away from the busy touristy streets. After lunch we then saw the Loreto, swan beach, the convent of St Agnes, the old town and Jewish quarter. We also fitted in time for an ice cream!After the tour we enjoyed a drink together on a rooftop bar with breathtaking views over Prague.As a group of women aged 24-60 holding different levels of fitness and biking experience, Michal allowed us to set the pace of the tour and he planned the day around our abilities. Not once did we feel uncomfortable or rushed.I will be recommending everyone to do one of Michals tours. He is very enthusiastic, knowledgeable and friendly.Thank you Michal for a fantastic day!"

I connected with Michal 2 years ago when my family relocated to Prague from Seattle. I was determined to find cafe's and bike trails that only the locals knew about. Michal has a 100% success rating in getting us connected to off beat places that have become staples in our day to day life. They are amazing places where we actually know the staff and they great us as locals now. We have gone on at least 3 (some solo and some with my wife and 2 kids 8 and12), trips with Michal now (and have a cool night time MT bike ride with lights through the forrest planned for October 016). Whenever I need I new bicycle route or want to explore a castle or village without the masses of people, I call Michal. He has an amazing knowledge of the grand scope of nature in Czech Republic and wonderful little nature getaways right in the center of Prague. He knows the trails, architectural wonders, Czech history, culture, art, and social issues in ways that you just can not get get in guide book. He also has a thorough understanding on the logistics of getting you to these places with train schedules down to the minute to make connections that get you out on the trails and back home again.But best of all (and the reason I keep in touch and do more tours), is that I really enjoy our conversations. Really how many tour guides do you ever really have a conversation with that goes even one sentence off script?So if you want a trip that takes you through nature with a little stop at a small local bakery for breakfast, sees you riding bikes on wonderful empty trails with great views, includes a stop at a Romanesque chapel that is not in your guide book and a stop for lunch at a local micro brewery with great lentil soup that your will never get to through your hotel, more great riding (or hiking), to catch the train that takes back into the city just in time to stop at a hip local illustration exhibit where you can see work by local upstart artists and crafts people, with great conversation along the way (in English), about art, culture, interesting social issues, design, architecture, or other topics-then I would say you have come to the right place! Enjoy!! Michal will give you a tour and a view of this amazing city that you will fondly remember for many many years. And best of all he is flexible and diverse in his approach to make it fit perfectly into what you want to see-not what he wants you to see.KeLan -Prague resident 2 year and counting..."

Michal was more than accommodating to our needs and organised to take us out for the day to see Karlstejn castle and do some hiking. We met him at the train station and he took charge of how to get to and from central Prague. He showed us the best view spots of Karlstejn for postcard-perfect photos. He got us to Karlstejn before the hordes of tourists and translated the tour for us (as it was in Czech). After he took us to a local place for lunch, then we continued walking in the countryside for several hours to some scenic locations. We ended the day with a drink at the pub before getting a train back to Prague. Michal let us change our mind on the day about what we wanted to do and where we wanted to go. He was able to give us lots of information about things on our walk and general information on Prague and the Czech Republic. It was our best day in Prague!"

He picked us up at our hotel and we had a nice local lunch before setting out to pick up our bikes which were good quality. Michal is full of information and energy. We covered a lot of territory in our half day. One caveat about biking in Prague - there are a few short hills and a bunch of cobblestones to navigate, so its not the easiest ride ever, especially on the 95 degree day we had. However, the views from up high are lovely and Michal is very happy to share his knowledge, and all his suggestions for things after your tour is over, too."

He's clearly a very experienced biker wise to the ways of biking in downtown Prague. (By the way, the drivers in Prague were quite courteous, we never got honked at once!)"

A few days later, he organized a bicycling tour for us outside of Prague which was terrific and it was great to get out of the city for a bit and see the surroundings. He proved to be very flexible (we had to change the date for the cycling at the last minute). After the cycling tour, he took us on the roof top of a cafe which had a breathtaking view of Prague....what a way to finish! He provides fair pricing and we would highly recommend him, especially if you are curious about things beyond the classic tourist sites."

We then took off onto gorgeous and very mild/moderate trails/forest roads through some incredible forest areas. There were some minimal rolling hills, but nothing crazy. We wove through some adorable small villages, with stops for him to add interesting historical facts relevant to the places we traveled through.

Michal gave me some important \"rules of the road\" and off we went for an entertaining, informative and rewarding 7.5 hr tour. Well worth the money for a safe and private tour custom tuned to my desires. Michal also showed me how to take my bicycle on the Funicular Railway, on the subway (and more importantly, how to take a bike on an escalator), included some local non-tourist stops for good food, lemonade and ice cream (that were genuine Czech) and also directed me to the National Archives so I could find my Father's previous address to scatter his ashes. His follow up email with photo links and more info was brilliant! In closing, the wealth of information that this art history major gave me was easy to digest and getting some exercise (on the shady side of the street!), good food and drink from a friendly, \"Born In Prague\" local was worth every penny. I recommend starting your trip this way. Thanx Michal!!!"

From there we rode through a very quaint village until we reached the edge of the wood where the real adventure began! Through woods, fields, and parkland down to a picturesque creek valley with small cottages and a local pub we rode. Then over a bridge and into another village before taking the scenic route along the river before boarding the train back home. We stopped 3 times - once for pivo, second for lunch and third for a coffee (we were hoping for another pivo, but that pub was closed). Michal is extremely knowledgeable about his homeland from it's inception as being discovered by a Celtic tribe where the coutry's name comes from to more current history as well as architecture, nature, and more! The pace is set by the tourist and you can stop and take pictures as often as you like! I'd highly recommend this tour to anyone and I look forward to doing another tour the next time I'm in Prague."

Overall, it was a wonderful way to get out of Prague and enjoy some good local food. Highlights included a local church, a great restaurant, and (especially!) the overgrown remains of a castle on the promontory with a beautiful view.See below for our full day:We began when Michal picked us up from our hotel and walked us to pick up our bikes (included in the cost of our trip). From here, we went on a small detour to see a church before hopping on the train to a small town about 40 minutes away. We then rode through the hills and some beautiful forest to see a local church perched on a outlook, with a nice view.This was followed by an authentic local lunch in a quaint town. While we were told this was the most expensive restaurant in the area, it was very reasonable by Prague standards (less than 10 euros per person for our meal and drinks).After eating, we rode along a river through farmlands to a truly gorgeous ruin. This was undoubtedly the highlight of the trip. From here, we caught another train to a small town, from which we biked straight back into Prague. Along the way, Michal explained the history of Bohemia and the city, demonstrating his knowledge of architecture once we had entered town. After dropping off the bikes, he showed us a rooftop beer terrace a beautiful view on the old town, where we said our goodbyes."

We ended up spending a whole morning with Michal who was giving us all the insight information (history, local legends, etc.) and the perfect tipps where to eat, drink or stroll around. So if you are looking for a good tourguide in Prague, Michal is the perfect choice."

We told him we wanted to see Prague on bike and that we were interested where locals go in the city. He met us at the bike rental shop and took us to parks that gave us beautiful views of the city. Even though I had been to Prague once before, he took us to areas I've never been before! Along the trip he included suggestions for local eats and drinks. He took us to this beautiful rooftop restaurant with the best views of the city at sunset.It should be noted that he also does walking tours, or even half-cycle-half-walking tours. We opted for the cycle tour because we would see more and our time was limited. He even followed up with us after we got back and mapped out our cycle route. Very thoughtful! I highly recommend anyone that wants to get a local flavor of Prague to take this tour!"

I merely said i would like to see some of the Czech countryside (a welcome respite from the crowds of Prague) and he did all the planning. The result was about a 20 km. ride along the river from Prague on a beautiful sunny day. Michel explained the local sites, cheerfully snapped many pictures of us 'in motion', and negotiated our trip back to Prague by train. Michal is a great travelling companion, and wilingly adjusts the schedule if needed. I had hoped to take at least one more trip with Michal, and he planned out three possible routes; unfortunately, the heat wave that hit Prague ' did me in', and he was very gracious when I explained I would have to cancel our second trip. Thank you, Michal, for such an enoyable day ... and we will do that second (and maybe more) trip when I am back in Prague!"

Even after our hike was over and we took the train back into the city, Michal stayed with me for a couple unplanned hours to show me some secret spots within Prague.

Biko has rain gear and the slight rain made biking easier. Most of the route is off the street which is nice. Absolutely gorgeous scenery the entire day. Our guide was really nice and kept a good pace. 20 miles is tough though if you don't ride often. Most of the way is level but there are a few hills here and there (I walked my bike up those). We were really tired after our day but still glad we did it. The only suggestion I'd have is for Biko to have more comfortable bike seats. Our butts hurt for about a week after the tour. We were too tired to walk up to the Castle but had a great lunch with our guide at a place he recommended. Overall just a great day and I'd highly recommend the tour."

They live up to their promise of quick response to email with good English. I worked out the details with Filippo over email. We agreed the Advanced Parks tour would be about right and that the guide could pace it according to my fitness. Filippo provided detailed directions on how to et to the stop, even detailing which tram stations and the type of ticket needed. And then a little map was provided showing how to walk from the tram stop to the shop.On the day everything was just as promised. I needed to buy a few items. It's more tour base than bike shop but they have a well chosen selection of solid basics like Endura shorts and jerseys. I rode a Giant Talon. Solid hire machine. Aluminium,so fairly light. Filippo took the time to tweak my suspension forks too. I did the normal (brakes, skewers, cranks) safety checks and everything else seemed very solid.The tour itself was excellent. Took about 4 hours including time for coffee stop. We had the option to stop for lunch but elected to carry on.Lots of sights and good photo stops. Some of the parks are big and you feel like you are in the middle of nowhere even though you're never that far from civilisation.Lots of history available from Daniel who was an excellent guide.On the site they say the aim is to keep the business small in order to run it well. I think Biko Adventures really lives up to thisOverall would highly recommend."

Had limited time and wanted to see all that I could so I booked with Biko a 10k early morning run on Saturday morning. Before tourists had left their hotel rooms I had seen the whole city jogging with Marek, heard its history and culture along the way and also got in a nice sweat. Marek met me at my hotel at 7 and off we went. We started in the old center, crossed the Charles Bridge which was really neat since it was empty, climbed some nearby hills through parks with stunning vistas, through the church then the castle then through the Jewish quarter and back. About two hours all in for the 10k jog although we also stopped for pictures and history along the way. Could be done in less time if you really want to push it. We covered every major site recommended in every \"weekend I. Prague guide\". We covered them to the sunrise. Marek's English skills were great and much better than my Czech so we were able to have a nice conversation while jogging. An awesome way to begin the day and highly recommended.One tip: Prague is packed with tourists during the summer so would highly recommend an early start. I had so much fun on the jog that I booked the Prague Parks Mountain Biking ride the following morning to experience life outside of the old city and also get another great workout in. Filipo and I took the bikes out and covered some serious ground in the nearby parks. I was in a very well maintained Giant hard tail. We chatted about history, culture and current politics between single tracks and up/down efforts. The route covers the less explored part of Prague that I'd bet most locals haven't even experienced. Towards the end of the ride we stopped for a coffee and ping pong match then headed back to Biko's store.Biko is a very professional company -- prompt communication, reliable and well operated. They can customize pretty much anything you're looking to do. I was there merely two days and thanks to Biko, when I boarded my 6am flight back to the US, I truly felt like I came and conquered."

I was greeted by my excellent guide Radek at the bike store who quickly set up the Giant Trance to my liking. A great attention to detail was put into the bike setup like shock and tyre pressure. I was handed a good helmet and gloves. Radek was quick to ask me what I wanted from the ride and he gauged my skill level quickly. Basically I asked for the best riding around Prague and it was not long before we were shredding up the forest trails. We even stopped at a riverside cafe for Pivo (Czech for beer) before continuing back to store some 6 hours later. I highly advise this tour for all levels of riders as the ride can be tapered to your skill level and your wants. Thanks Radek and Biko adventures. I hope we meet again soon.

With so many options on the website we contacted the owner to figure out which tour would be suited to us and settled on the Advanced Prague Parks tour.On the day we were expected to be at the shop at 9 in the morning. The shop was easily found with the directions we got and we were greeted wonderfully by the owner and we quickly got the necessary paperwork done. Then our guide arrived and we got our gear. The bikes were excellent, the helmets comfy and we even got a bottle of water (which our guide kindly refilled during the tour from a bigger bottle he had and we again refilled in a cafe along the route).The tour we choose was perfect and showed us a bunch of beautiful spots we otherwise probably wouldn't have found or visited. Our guide expertly showed the way and stopped in the right places for photos and to give us some information about what we were seeing.After 5 hours in beautiful weather we arrived back at the shop, tired, but immensely satisfied.

My Giant Trance was in good working condition. It had Shimano Deore components, not exactly high end but it shifted and braked well. The staff was the best though. They made sure I took a spare tube, portable inflator, tire tongs, bike lock and helmet. This was extremely handy when I had a flat. Another shop may have left me stranded. I also appreciated not being nick-and-dimed for these items that were included with the rental. I can't praise my guide, Lucie, enough. She was the friendliest, best guide I've ever had on any tour ever. She planned an interesting itinerary that not only included some great trails but an airport with vintage airplanes, an amazing overlook of the city from the mountains, and an animal rescue with owls, deer, and other creatures. I would recommend requesting her by name. You will not be disappointed. Lastly, I would like to praise the shop for how the handled the broken brake. I took a spill and damaged the break lever. I wasn't sure whether or not they'd charge me for damages. They walked the bike over to a repair shop one block away. When the technician said it would be an easy repair, they elected not to charge me anything. I felt this was extremely reasonable and fair. I would like to commend Filippo this. Other bike shops may have gouged their customers for this. It's nice to find honest businessmen like this."

We had an AWESOME experience and I will definitely be back next summer when I am next in Prague, and will recommend it to anyone.Bikes: I usually ride a 29 hardtail and was a little concerned all they had was 27.5 bikes. But after having experienced the trails and some of the many technical sections I think it was best to have a 27.5 - it is perfectly suited to the area. I found the bikes VERY well maintained, which was refreshing after just renting a crappy bike in Berlin. And they are also of very good quality. I brought my own SPD pedals.Guides: The first guide was Tomas and the second was Lucie. Both were very friendly and knowledgeable about the trails. They adjusted the pace and route as needed as each day unfolded. This was my first guided ride experience and I was very impressed. While I considered loading a GPS route in my bike computer and doing an unguided ride, I felt I would not have enjoyed the ride as much and would have spent a lot of time worrying about navigation rather than just enjoying the ride. And the guides bring knowledge of every twist and turn and side trail which is truly invaluable. They are all well trained and personable and it shows that the owner puts a lot of energy into building a good team.Routes: The different routes are carefully planned and you have lots of choices. I am a regular mountain biker and really was pleased with the routes both days. I probably enjoyed The Great Escape the most, and would rate it one of the most enjoyable rides of my life. The team and Biko is excellent and I HIGHLY recommend them and their guided tours!! I will be back again,"

This reflected his pride in his city and desire to share it with us. He was very flexible about modifying start time due to weather. The route was peaceful and gorgeous."

They are able to individualize the tours to your desire and the guys at the shop are really nice.

The hike was full of surprises and Mark chose the way according to what we wanted to see and experiment. We got to walk across green fields, climb on rocks, stand on cliffs with great views of the city, walk by a river and even through a cave (that is just naming a few of the surprises)!! It was definitely the highlight of my trip to Prague and a real energy booster... It is a must try activity and a very fun way to spend a day outdoors.As for the Biko team, they are very professional. Filippo replies realy fast to his mails and has clear answers to any question you might have. Mark, our guide, was very friendly and made the walk even more pleasant. He knew exactly when to step it up or slow it down according to our needs and was very careful to safety issues.Do not hesitate for a second to try any of the Biko activities, especially the hike :)"

Our guide, Marek, was brilliant from start to finish and my friend and I had a fantastic day hiking with him in the sandstone wonders \u010cesk\u00fd r\u00e1j has to offer.Marek collected us from our Prague apartment and drove us out to the area (entry included in tour) and took us on a complete guided hike through the forest and sandstone features. Although the trails are clearly marked, it was peace of mind to go with someone who knew the area like the back of their hand, and since neither of us drive it was brilliant being chauffeured there too! Marek also tailored the pace to suit us- we are snap happy with the cameras so there was a lot of photo breaks. I was suffering from a heavy head cold and cough so nose blowing stops were also made, plus lots of patience when ascending the many stairs amongst the rock features themselves to make sure we traveled together and no disastrous wrong turns were made, whilst accounting for my breathlessness!The number of photo opportunities were countless and we happily blamed Marek for bringing us to such a picturesque location, which he took really well with a wry grin. His great sense of humor, good conversation and general personablity made the tour really fun and enjoyable. We felt looked after, safe and well informed about the local area, the city of Prague and Czech Republic in general under the unintrusive and easy conversation with him, as we wound our way through vast and tall rocky outcrops and forested gullies.We had a snack at the forest lodge before tackling the more challenging part of the hike which was more and steeper stairs up and down through the rock formations but the views and narrow gaps are well worth it- and of course the great photo opportunities too! Marek then drove us to a local town for a Czech lunch and past a couple of castles (more photo opportunities) before heading back into the city.For a break from the delights of Prague itself, and getting out to see some natural wonders, I highly recommend a hike in \u010cesk\u00fd r\u00e1j with Biko - well worth the time, the reasonable cost and making a new friend!Thanks again Biko and Marek for a fantastic day out!"

The weather was rainy and cold the day of our trip but Flippo made sure we had proper clothing for the conditions (providing us with several jackets to choose from) and went to the trouble of putting extra fenders on the bikes to help prevent the dirty spray off the tires from hitting us. The route was mostly flat with lots of variety, cycling through the city, parks, forests and a small village near the edge of the city. The beer and food at the brewery, our end point, definitely did not disappoint! The option to ride the train back most of the way provides lots of flexibility for riders of all abilities. Our guide, Tomas, was entertaining, relaxed and knowledgeable about both the city and biking.

It is good to check out the other side of Prague, instead of just the overcrowded Old Town. My guide Marek was very patience, showing me around the more \"down to earth\" part of Prague. Be prepared to wear proper riding outfit especially during winter time. You also need to have enough energy to going uphills and down, through the woods and the mud ( for my case as it was raining the day I ride).

BIKO adventures organised this tour for us based on our request to ride 100Kms + per day for 2 days. The routes selected were based on our abilities. We chose BIKO Adventures as recommended to us by another friend of mine who used their services before.As it was just a 3 day getaway, we chose to rent out the road bikes from BIKO rather than travel with our own bikes. This proved to be a sensible decision as the bikes we rented were good bikes and very well maintained. We did not have to worry about what tyres to use or what gearing/cassette do we need for the ride. The bikes were kitted accordingly and also at the right price.We met with Filippo, the owner and Marek, our tour guide. Two great individuals who ascertained that our tour will be a positive one. The weather was beautiful and the carefully chosen routes by Marek were simply awesome, with lovely scenery, historic monuments and castles, monasteries etc. Marek constantly provided us with historic facts and also information about the towns we passed through. The pace ridden by out tour guide was in line with our ability and he was very accommodating with our wishes.Will I recommend BIKO Adventures - definitely. The product they offer is good and at the right price. I actually plan to do a ski adventure together with my family through BIKO and also am considering the Prague to Vienna tour with a couple of friends, again using BIKO's services."

I\u2019ve had many trips with Biko and Filippo and yet again this turned out to be the highlight of my trip to Prague. Blessed with glorious weather we met at the shop, close to Vycherad, it\u2019s easy to find and get to from anywhere in Prague, either on foot or nearby tram and metro stops.We set off, bikes strapped to the roof and headed north toward the Polish border. A stop on the way to refresh with good coffee from the Agip filling station (great coffee believe it or not!). We arrived at our destination less than 2 hours after setting off. The base station has a good range of facilities and even though it was the weekend it wasn\u2019t too busy. We set off and experienced some wonderful flow trail and single-track, wonderful scenery and exciting trails in a beautiful part of the countryside. Ability as judged perfectly by Filippo and we spent a good four or five hours of stimulating and magical riding. Plenty of places to stop off en-route for refreshment and food. The trails are very well designed and safe, but still gives the rider the chance to experience speed and excitement. Well worth the journey.As I have come to expect from Biko the service and organisation is world class, I genuinely believe you would be hard pushed to find better elsewhere. Check out the shop for some brilliant memorabilia from t-shirts to mugs cycling gear, all reasonably priced. The reviews on TripAdvisor speak from themselves. If you want a brilliant outdoor activity, with personal service, great bikes to ride, well designed and crafted routes then look no further. And as for a Filippo, you\u2019re a legend, keep up the amazing work and see you in December when I\u2019m back!"

We took a private tour to Karlstejn - totally worth it as it wasn't that much more money and our guide Daniel went at our pace and stopped when we wanted to. The Giant bikes were very comfortable. Roads were flat except two on ramps to bridges. There were multiple road types: paved, dirt, metal, rock and sand. I hate off road biking but it wasn't too much. We stopped after 11 miles at a cafe for a snack. Great gelato. The hardest part of the trip was walking the bike up the hill to the castle! Our guide waited for us while we did the 50 minute castle tour then came back to the bottom of the hill for lunch. Took the train back to Prague - was about 35 minutes. We got a flat tire on the way and the guide fixed it immediately. Great time had!"

It's an easy store to find, and I went a couple of days early to reserve my bike and talk with Filippo. Everything was as promised on the day I came by - good bike, and all the accessories I needed. The only thing to improve is the map for solo riders - not a cue sheet but an automobile road map. So off I went - directions to get out of town were flawless so I didn't start making wrong turns for a bit. But with the map and my GPS I always knew about where I was. And saw some sites I would've missed otherwise. Ended up doing about 100kms on a nine hour adventure that included narrow dirt hiking paths, small towns, dehydration, the Amerika quarry, Karlstejn and a sprint back to town to make store closing. I wouldn't have done it any other way but if you're not that adventurous, I'd recommend a guide, or renting one of their GPS'. Filippo and his wife were great at the store getting me set up and taking care of me at the end. I'd use them again if I ever get back and would recommend Biko to anyone."

Honza and Fillipo arranged a brilliant tour called 'The Great Escape', and it really was,an escape from the bustle of central Prague, through stunning Czech country side and some pristine single track through virgin broadleaf Forrest. Including some not normally seen back suburbs of communist Prague. This ride definitely sits inside the top ten rides I have done, and I can't speak highly enough of the service and equipment provided through Biko. They hired me a Giant Xtc 27.5, with rebas and Deore, good enough for a decent thrash. As I led in, the course involved a lot of twists and turns and would've taken an eternity if I was trying to find it via maps. Especially with my non existant Czech. Over all this tour was my highlight of Prague, much to my wife's behest."

We were driven about 90 minutes out of the city, and had a wonderful 4 hour hike through grottoes of sandstone rock formations, magical moss and fern gardens. There were plenty of opportunities for photo-ops, and enough up and down to give us all a good workout. We had a late lunch in a local restaurant before returning to Prague by about 4 pm. The 2000 CZK (about 80$) per person included the round trip, guides, and park entry fees (lunch not included, but inexpensive and tasty). Cesky Raj has multiple paths, and it was great to have guides to keep us from getting lost, as well as providing lots of information about the area and the Czech Republic in general.

We corresponded beforehand from Sydney and F met up with us when we arrived in Prague to chat, get to know us a little & recommend the trips we'd most enjoy. He suggested we hike, xc ski and moutain bike - all perfect suggestions. This meeting felt like meeting up with a friend who was going to show you around their town, rather than meeting a travel operator. F drove us to Czech Paradise - he's a really safe and steady driver so it was a very relaxing trip. The hikes were spectacular - misty, crisp air, mossy crevices, bare forests - so different to our Australian bush, ... and almost as beautiful! The XC ski-ing was so much fun. F organised all the gear and then took us on a circuit that was a sufficient challenge for the fit 14yo and didn't knock middle aged mother out! Perfect. Filippo was a great ski instructor. We then had a day in the mountains on our own and F and his team kindly sorted our bus tix etc back to Prague. Finally the mtb trip to Karlstej which the 14yo mountain biker loved. Wonderful ride along the river, over bridges, thru little villages. In K, while I toured the Castle and the streets of K, F taught the 14yo mtb drills on the gutters on the streets of K! Everyone was a winner. Just today my son said - I'd love to go back and see Filippo - which prompted me to write this long overdue thank you. Thank you Filippo - the new shop looks amazing."

I had heard about mountainbiking in the area of Prague and decided I wanted to rent a mountainbike and do some exploring in the countryside. I quickly found Biko Adventures via google and emailed them my intentions. The answer came within a few minutes from Filippo, the owner, and we struck up a conversation by email. After exchanging a couple of emails with ideas flowing back and forth, I decided to book the Advanced MTB Karlstejn Castle Off-Road Extended tour. It consists of an approximate 65 km of climbing, singletracks and dirt-roads with real cool technical sections in between, and all this through the beautiful countryside outside of Prague.I changed my original plan of renting a bike and go out there alone, after advice from Filippo. He suggested a guide because a lot of trails are kinda hard to find if you're not familiar with the surroundings and luckily for myself I listened to the advice. My guide Marek, a really friendly local guy with extensive MTB experience gave me one of the coolest biking experiences I've had since a long time. During some parts my adrenalin level really went through the roof. Conclusion: Excellent equipment (high level Giant MTB hardtail), excellent guide (cool local MTB guru), excellent route (handpicked trails and routes) and excellent support (great advice and fast emailcontact)Next time I'm in Prague I'll definitely visit again!"

A beautiful excursion and well worth the effort."

Beautiful scenery and great company, so much so that we didn't realise we'd ridden 35km! The tour has definitely been the highlight of our trip! A wonderful way to see a different element of the Czech Republic outside the business of Prague! The Biko team are enthusiastic, welcoming and put a lot of pride and effort into what they do! Bety was fantastic, very professional and by the end of the day we felt like we were hanging out with a friend rather than a tour guide, and Filippo greeted us with a warm welcome when we returned! A must-do!!! :)"

            "review": "Breathtaking (literally) hike through Czech Paradise with an Outstanding Guide. I had the most amazing hike in the Czech Paradise with Marek!From the start, Filippo, the store owner, provided personal attention as he addressed all my questions through email.On the day of the tour, I met Marek at the shop who was the best guide I have ever had in touring 8 different countries around the world. Since I was the only one on the tour and being a little shy with strangers, I was a little worried that there would be lengthy periods of awkward silence. However, Marek's friendly and open nature quickly made me feel comfortable. He told me about the Czech Republic, other places to see and do, and made conversation about other things, making our 8km hike through the majestic Czech Paradise pass quickly.The Czech Paradise is truly an incredible place to visit. The best way I can describe it is like walking onto the set of Lord of the Rings as we wandered through the sandstone pillars and cliffs and through pine forests. The surrounding houses are also picturesque with older homes and bright green fields, which reminded me of movies from an earlier time in Europe. This hike is definitely challenging at some points since there are many stairs, but the views are absolutely worth it! I found Marek's pace to be comfortable (he might have slowed his natural pace to match mine), so I never felt rushed though I was breathing hard taking some of the stairs that seemed to never end. It was like a playground for adults as we wove around the giant rocks and he challenged me to squeeze through an optional passageway. I had taken my camera and took dozens of photos, which he patiently waited for me to finish before moving on and even offered to take some photos of me (despite the fact that the shop sells an Action Photo Reportage package for an additional 200CZK= $8USD).Following our hike, Marek took me to a restaurant in Jicin where he recommended a traditional Bohemian meal for me, which was delicious and extremely inexpensive. I only paid 150CZK= $6USD for a meal with a soda. Then it was back to Prague.The shop required a small deposit (250CZK=$10USD for my tour) to make the reservation with the remainder of the payment due on the day of the tour. The website states that they will accept Euro at their in-house exchange rate of 1\u20ac=26 CZK, but Marek went to the additional trouble of bringing me downtown to an exchange office (EXCHANGE s.r.o. Address: Kaprova 14/13 110 00) with better rates and no commission fees.When we arrived back to the shop, Marek's passion for outdoor sports continued to shine through as he provided me a map and highlighted nice places to go for a run or swim.This hike is not to be missed and the personal attention of Biko Adventures Prague has raised my expectations of customer service. Highly recommend!Additional Tips:-Wear comfortable foot wear with non-slip soles. The hike goes through forest and sandstone surfaces where there are some slippery areas.-A Camelbak is handy, but I found the bottle of water that the shop provided me adequate for the cool weather I had.-Eat a good breakfast; bring a snack. We were walking at a moderate pace and still did not get to the restaurant until about 1300.-Bring a rain jacket (the shop also has some). I came in March and in the time we were hiking, we experienced light rain shower, sun, and snow!-Pack minimally. The ups and downs will make your pack heavier as the time wears on. Plus it makes it harder to fit through some of the narrower parts."

It's difficult to know where to begin my review, because it really starts well over month prior to departing home for Praha. I must have sent of a dozen questions about location, equipment, tours and logistics. Even with an eight hour time difference, my questions were always answered almost immediately! Upon arrival in Europe the first email that popped up on my phone was a warm welcoming wish from Filippo asking if my trip was good along with an enthusiastic \"see you at 9 tomorrow for our first ride.\"I rode three guided mountain bike tours with Filippo, Petr, and Marek doing somewhere around 100 miles and 6000' of climb total. Each one-on-one trip to a different location was loaded with information about the history of the city and included a stop at a small out-of-the-way gem of pub or brewery I never would have found as a tourist. I'm not the best MTB rider, but each of the staff members knew exactly how to push me to improve my skills while keeping me safe and ensuring I had an excellent experience. They were all skilled riders who struck a nice balance between 'challenging and encouraging' throughout the more technical parts of the rides. Each ride started, finished and ran exactly as represented.I debated bringing my own bike for the rides and I'm glad I didn't. The shop offered very well maintained and current model Giant bikes. I rode three different bikes, each being set for the type of terrain I would experience that day. I know it's not typical, but I was the first to ride one of their new full suspension bikes-- It was a much easier experience than hauling my bike and paying baggage fees. Plus I was able to blame my shortcomings on not having my own bike!! There were absolutely no equipment issues at all.My last tour was a hike to the Bohemian Paradise or Cesky Raj with Marek. While you certainly could do this trip alone-- don't! The shop provided round trip transportation to the park from my hotel and 6 hours of one-on-one time with a local guide who not only has traveled Europe but knows the city of Prague from childhood through adulthood.While you might think you're simply buying tours or time on a bike or trail that's only the tip of the iceberg. What you're really getting is a caring family owned small business that will take the time to recommend restaurants, pubs, things to do and see (or avoid) and facilitators that will educate you about their home country and city. Each staff member is carefully selected and understands that customer service and an exceptional customer experience is the primary thing that matters.I traveled to Prague because of the positive things I'd heard about its beauty, history and culture. I left Prague feeling incredibly lucky to have found Biko on the web, centering my Prague experience around cycling with this caring, youthful, energetic, fit group of individuals. Let's face it-- burning all those calories while taking in the incredible sites preps a guy well to drink lots of pilsner, eat like a Czech and sleep like a baby. Thanks guys-- you all made my experience one I'll never forget!"

The trails fast and rolling, interspersed with small villages and scenic farming countryside. The bike was excellent quality. Filippo was an amazing guide - highly knowledgeable of the areas and also an excellent rider. If you a rider I highly recommend going on a Biko guided tour (without a guide you will spend all your time looking at maps trying to figure out where to go) A great getaway from the city, a chance to see the countryside, lots of fast and smooth single track and a good cardio workout. I guarantee you will go back for a second ride as I did. Enjoy"

Fat Bikes are essentially bicycles with huge tyres on them which roll over snow seamlessly. I stopped in at the Biko Shop Prague and got talking to Filippo the owner. The most striking thing about Filippo is that he is very smart about his business and cares a great deal about his customers. He loves sharing his passion for the outdoors with you and this is obvious. We drove about an hour outside of Prague, picked up the bikes and headed to the mountains for an awesome day riding the snowy trails. The tours are private and customizable to your level of ability/ fitness. We stopped for lunch up in the mountains and then continued on in the afternoon. It was an awesome experience and a unique thing to take away from Prague. If you are looking for a unique experience of your own, I cannot recommend Biko Adventures enough. These guys are good at what they do because they have an independent approach to their business. All the very best to you Filippo and your team!"

Our guide was more than patient, zipped up and down the slopes next to us as we made our slower way round the circuit.

            "review": "A Great Biking Experience!. Biko Adventures was one of the highlights of our Prague trip. I (in my late 20s) traveled to Prague with my parents (in their early 60s) and convinced them to do a 35 kilometer bike tour from Prague to Karlstejn Castle. Neither had been on a bike outdoors in over 15 years. I researched the different tour options available through Biko and found many options I'd be interested in, but the Karlstejn trip turned out to be the best tour for my parents as beginner riders (though a few narrow passages to navigate over bridges). Petar was our guide, and we rode along with two other couples, which was a nice-sized group. It was really great to bike through the countryside, outside of Prague, along the river and end at a beautiful and historic castle which we had to to explore. We finished off with a Czech beer and traditional meal in the town of Karlstejn. I truly recommend Biko in general, as the staff and guides were very friendly and they have a quaint little shop in Prague (which we bought graphic t-shirts from Filippo, the owner), and I especially recommend the Karlstejn tour for travelers looking for a bit of adventure, but on the more leisure side. I would definitely come back to ride with Biko!"

We, four friends, took the park tour in November 2014 with the owner; Filippo, as our guide. What a great guy! Very friendly, likeable and knowledgeable! We couldn't ask for a better guide! And the parks where amazing! We can only imagine how nice they must be during the hot season! One last thing; BIKO invests in proper bikes so you get really good bikes! Nothing to worry about there! Actually, nothing to worry about at all! Take one of their tours - you will not regret it! We give BIKO Adventures Prague 8 out of 6 stars! :-) (yes, I can count!)Conclusion: We highly recommend BIKO and we will certainly do this again on our next trip to Prague., either with friends and/or familiy (with small kids)!PS. Don't forget to buy a t-shirt while you're there! They are designed by Filippo and are of great quality! Clever guy!"

I took the \"Ride to Karlstejn Castle Classic\" tour and I had Fillippo, the owner, as my guide. He was not only welcoming and friendly but he had many interesting stories about the sights on the way, like the holiday houses built during the Communist era, and was also only too happy to share stories about life in Prague. I could see he genuinely enjoyed taking visitors on his cycling tours and it was just brilliant to be riding through roads, bridges, dirt and grass trails to Karlstejn Castle on a beautiful sunny day.

The approach to the castle itself was spectacular, at which point Marek gave us some time to explore the grounds.We then had lunch at a great restaurant just outside the tourist traps near the castle, which actually ended up being one of our favorite meals in Prague, and returned a different way. The way back included more small towns and bike paths along the river bringing us back into Prague. It was great to see a part of the city and countryside that you just can't experience except on a bike. I'd highly recommend this to anyone visiting Prague."

To do this, I takes having great guides who know the routes and are easy to get along with. The best rides feel like you're out with a friend who's sharing a favorite route with you. Marek and the rest of the people at Biko Adventures easily fulfilled this. We were so happy after our first ride that we booked two more even though we were only there for a total of ten days. The equipment was great, they changed out our pedals, adapted to our jet lagged tardiness and recommended the best place for lunch after a long morning of biking. Looking forward to going back."

            "review": "Escape the city with Marek. My husband and I took a 22-mile guided ride with Marek, beginning at the Biko shop and ending in Karlstejn at the castle. We really loved the different terrain, from city cobblestone streets, to a paved bike path, a narrow dirt path, grass, and village lanes. We had originally booked the 36-mile road bike tour...but I was admittedly a little tired on our biking day, and Marek easily accommodated my request for a shorter ride. My husband found the option to add a \"VIP package\" which is basically photographs of your group as you ride, a bakery stop, and lunch. Our whole experience was above and beyond; at the shop, we were greeted warmly and really made to feel welcome. On the ride itself, Marek was superb - he let us set the pace, and seemed to know exactly when we wanted to chat and when we wanted to just ride and soak in the scenery. The highlight (for me) was a stop along the way for pastries. I had an apple strudel and it was divine. The highlight for my husband was riding along the river. When we arrived in Karlstejn, Marek stayed with the bikes while Dan and I walked up to the castle (biking up is not allowed). Best of all, Marek gave us the option of where we wished to eat in Karlstejn. He took us to an off-the-tourist-path place, translated the menu for us, and we enjoyed an idyllic and delicious lunch. Marek arranged a train ride back for us, helped me navigate my bike up and down stairs, and delivered us happily back to Biko. There, we met the owner Filippo, who took time to introduce himself and thank us for riding with them. It was one of the best customer service experiences I've had on a vacation, ever."

This was the first time that I do free ride and I enjoy so much the tour \"Block and Park\". Filippo is a good MTB teacher who stimulated me in all the moment of the tour.I recommend a trip with Biko adventures if you like bike and nature and if you want see a very different side of Prague (far from the classical tourist routes)."

Marek answered immediately and confirmed that we could join the Karlstejn 'easy' tour that we wanted to take. After a little bit of difficulty finding the shop (don't use 'directions' in trip advisor: it sends you to a dusty bike shop; go to the Vratislavova address) we got to the right place and enjoyed a very nice tour through surprising roads near the river, well described in the other reviews. Marek knows the city very well and has also a vast knowledge of running trails. A true recommendation if you want to do something active in Prague."

I\u2019m an avid cyclist, so when I came across the BIKO website in my googling for activities I was very excited! And BIKO did not let me down! I did the road bike tour to Karlsten and it was fantastic. It was just me and the owner, Fillipo (the friendliest tour guide ever), riding throughout the Czech countryside, as if we were two regular friends going out for a bike ride. We stopped on the way to the castle, at a fantastic local restaurant for lunch. It was non-touristy, true local cuisine. Riding along, it was great to learn about the local culture from Fillipo, and to be out exploring rather than spending the day in a tourist trap. With only one day to spend in Prague, I was little worried that I wouldn\u2019t get enough of the \u2018Prague experience\u2019 by spending the day on the bike\u2026but it turned out to be the perfect way to see the Czech Republic. I got the best of both worlds \u2013 a taste of countryside, feeling like a local, with enough time in the afternoon/evening to explore the city on my own. I recommend BIKO to anyone visiting Prague, and I hope I get to come back some day to try out another of their tours."

We did all the regular sites and ate yummy food for the first three days, eagerly awaiting our day on the bikes with Biko. We chose the Easy Prague Parks because I was still nursing my knee after April surgery. I'd call the trip Easy/Medium because there definitely was some tricky declines single track and it was longer than just a couple hours. Prague has a park system that is incredible...they all connect. We spent about four hours winding around the city through these parks. Such variety and views! It was the perfect ride for us. The highlight, of course, was Filippo, the owner and guide. He is wonderful, friendly, informative and safe. Miklaus also came to learn the trail and he was fantastic too! We were spoiled. There were many highlights but one memorable one was mid-way stopping for a snack where we were introduced to the most delicious blueberry dumplings. I have to learn to make them! Next time in Prague we will have to do the Great Escape...I'll be ready. Oh, and definitely splurge for the photo option. Filippo is an amazing photographer! By the way, he designed his own website because he has that many skills."

My wife and I rented a pair of \"standard\" hybrid bikes from BikoAdvantures for a Sunday cruise up the Vltava river - meaning going upstream, towards the south. That avoids having to go through central Prague.The bicycles were great - like the BikoAdventures web site says, they are clearly above average for rental equipment. The staff was very friendly, gave us advice about routes and a map, and sent us on our way. The shop is very close to the bike trail, so we were on it in moments.The bike trail on the east bank (Old Town side) of the Vltava is well marked, paved, and mostly separate from any auto roadways. There is a new high-level and very cool bicycle bridge across the Vltava several kilometers up the river that gives you access to the smaller river (forgot the name) that runs past the Karlstejn castle. We crossed the bridge and went a few more kilometers but not all the way to Karlstejn before turning back to Prague. It was a great 4-5 hour ride, mostly level with frequent spots to purchase water, beer or snacks. This is the way to cycle!If you are an outdoors person, you should get in touch with the BikoAdventures folks while in Prague."

Our guide Filippo really made the tour personal. Don't forget do buy the Biko t-shirts as a memory. If you are into MTB this is a must do when in Prague."

The long, tired but wonderful hike to karlstejn castle makes the surrounding views from the top of the castle most appreciative. Our guide Adam made us felt like we were old friends. The other trip to Czech paradise was another really wonderful hike. The walk and climb through the rocks formations were most exhilarating. Our guide Marek really knows his way around and showed us the most beautiful and breath taking sights. Thank you Biko!!!!!"

It's people like Filipo who have the heart for what they do that makes all the difference! Also when I left my windbreaker at the shop, he volunteered to help mail it back to Singapore. The bike ride to Karlstein was beautiful not to mention I got a work out !!"

Filippo was our guide who gave us a history of the 'now' versus the 'then' when under communism, it was very informative & helped you to understand the Czech mentality. I can not recommend the quality of the bikes high enough, I have done a number of bike tours in other countries, & these are very well maintained. Filippo is an exceptional person, very honest & ethical with a big emphasis on being environmentally friendly. If you want to maintain a level of activity then this is your adventure company.

Not only was it a beautiful ride out of the city to Karlstejn along 2 rivers, but it was a fun experience due to the enthusiasm of our friendly guides, Filippo and Peter.It was a 30 minute walk or a 20 minute tram ride from our hotel to Biko Adventure's new shop, where we quickly got our bikes and headed out of the city. Prague has fabulous bike paths in the city and out into the outskirts, and we really enjoyed riding along these and the quiet local roads on the way to Karlstejn. The castle itself was great to see, and then we had a delicious lunch at a local restaurant near the train station. Thankfully, Filippo and Peter could decipher the Czech menu!Sightseeing in a city like Prague is great, but getting out of the city and into the countryside on a bicycle and speaking with the local guides is an awesome way to see something different and learn about the culture of a place. If you are going to Prague, I highly recommend that you check out Biko Adventures and go on a biking or hiking trip with Filippo.... you'll be so glad you did!"

            "review": "Mountain biking in February. Think that the outdoors are out of reach in winter months in Prague then think again. It was a return trip to Prague in early February and my thoughts, once the flight and hotel were booked, turned immediately to Biko and the programme of activities. I was wondering what would be available but a quick email to Filippo confirmed there was plenty of adventures to be had. The weather was excellent so lots of options were available, but I decided on two separate days, one the mountain bike and beer advanced and the second the mountain bike to Karlstejn advanced.I have had the pleasure of using the services of Filippo in the past and have always admired the professionalism of the outfit. Great quality bikes and fantastic customer service so that's why I keep coming back for more. Biko is relocating to their own shop and Filippo was in the advanced stages of refurbishing the shop so things are looking even better. Day one was the mountain bike and beer. Filippo met me at my hotel and we headed over to the new shop. 30 minutes later I was out in the fresh air cycling the streets of Prague. We quickly made our way up to Petrin, then onward through the countryside to the star castle and beyond. Breathtaking winter scenery mixed with a solid workout and some single track adventures. The conditions were fine so my worries about freezing temperatures were not realised. Filippo is ever conscious of safety and ability so tours are matched to the prevailing conditions and your skill level. After around 4 hours of mountain biking we arrived at the famous brewery. Bikes secured, a hearty lunch was washed down with some fine Czech beer. Definitely recommend purchasing a few bottles for yourself or gifts for family if your luggage allowance has spare capacity. Refreshed and fed we left the brewery, downhill to the river and a crossing by boat left us a straightforward ride back to the centre of Prague. Obligatory coffee stop on the way back at the Trojan Horse was an extra treat. A wonderful day!A few days later I embarked on the Karlstejn trip. I was ready for a bigger challenge having no problems with the earlier trip. Again we were blessed with glorious weather, bright winter sunshine and clear skies. It was cold but once you get moving that soon changes. Again quickly out of the city centre had us exploring the stunning scenery. Stop off at a hidden lake, cycling through a pitch black rocky cave and some climbing of steep and muddy tracks. Options are always provided.. We can go the easy way or the hard way.. The choice is always yours. We cycled onwards deeper into the country side, across bush and marsh and through forest. Cycling across a ridge suddenly opened up to stunning views across the valley, high above you could see for miles across the sprawling countryside. Filippo in designing his routes has managed to bring in the constant art of surprise, just when you are least expecting it another stunning scene or fast downhill single track! Extras on the tour, if your legs are up for it, can include a visit to a deep lake which has formed in a disused quarry, well worth the extra 8 km for the views alone. Then after a hard few hours cycling we had reached the highest point in the tour. Downhill all the way though amazing countryside and forest track, very few people other than you, the bike, and nature for company and the cool wind in your face. At the end of the downhill the castle appears in all it's glory. Lunch and a beer at the station had us both refreshed so instead of catching the train there we cycled two extra stops closer to Prague before finally jumping on the train to sit back and relax. This was a physically demanding tour but exhilarating, great sense of achievement completing the day. If you spend time in Prague I am sure you will love the city and all it has to offer, if you spend time with Biko I'm sure you'll have memories which will far outlive your memories of Prague! Or perhaps like me you'll end up coming back time and time again to enjoy them both.There are other activities to do in Prague, you could even hire a bike and tour round yourself. But the real value with Biko is the quality and personal service that is given. Filippo is genuinely passionate about all he does and your enjoyment of the tour is his primary aim. His knowledge and research into hidden games of the Czech countryside gives a unique insight and experience you would struggle to get anywhere else. Cannot recommend Filippo and Biko highly enough.. I'm already looking toward to my next visit."

Unforatunatley, the skiing was not to be, so decided to go on the The Cliff Trail walking tour, a 10km walk with some great views of the old and new parts of town. Having thawed out from the -10C temperatures, we both agree this walk was a great addition to a normal city break .One final thanks as we really appreciated Filippo's professionalism, friendliness and knowledge of the regaion - not to mention a fantastic recommendation for lunch after the walk to warm up!"

Chanced upon Biko Adventures and didnt hesitate to sign up for a bike tour in the czech countryside - as i was itching to do some freeride, i signed up for the Great Escape package.Fillipo has a great fleet of well-maintained bikes, and offers various pedal options to suit one's preferences. He provided insights into old czech communist housing developments and architecture when we rode through en route to the park which I thought was a nice touch. During our ride he makes an effort to get to know his fellow rider better so as to tailor the trail to your liking. We started out doing some xc climbs and small drops, After awhile I got a little tired from climbing and opted to do more descents and we went through an alternate path along mad fun singletrails and river crossings. Fillppo really cares for his fellow rider, and will stop if you need rest, or drop by a convenience store along the way if you need a bite. It's nice to have him navigate for you so you dont have to worry about getting lost and finding your way back. He really knows his way around town and the countryside.On the way back to the shop we dropped by Prague's first castle by the river where there was a great view. For seasoned riders, Fillippo provides excellent service at a good price. Even better prices during the autumn/winter season. He has no qualms getting muddy with you.For those who like cleaner rides, he also offers urban rides that are really scenic and will help you to see another side of Prague."

We left the bike shop mid morning and rode along the Vtlava River through the outskirts of Prague. The weather couldn't have been better - 65 F and sunny - in late October (we certainly lucked out). The 21-mile ride is flat and meanders through some little villages, across scenic bridges, and along two rivers. The trees were just past peak but beautiful. We loved Prague, but loved getting a glimpse of life outside of Prague as well. Mid way we stopped in a small town for a delicious lunch and the next stop was Karlstejn Castle. After climbing to see the castle we hopped on the train - modern and comfortable - back to Prague. During the tour Filippo provided lots of insight about the Czech culture.

There are many quaint villages and beautiful homes, bridges and other gorgeous scenery to admire. It was so nice to get into a bit of nature after being in the hustle and bustle of the city. Our guide Mark was excellent at making sure everyone was comfortable and the group was going at a good pace. You can make this trip no matter your level of fitness. We ride regularly so we went pretty fast but you could easily go more slowly and there aren't many hills to battle as well. Great tour and if we'd stayed a few more days in Prague I would have loved to take more with Biko!"

I had contacted Filippo about doing one of his bike tours, and settled on the easy Ride to Karlsjen Castle. We were set up with very nice bikes, and had a great time with our guide Mark taking a leisurely ride out to the castle. We went at our own pace, so there was not pressure to ride fast (or slow - if that was the case). Both of us enjoyed the ride so much that we came back a couple of days later and did the Blocks and Parks tour (took the easy ride on that one too). Marek was our guide on that ride, and he kept us informed about the history of the areas we rode through as we progressed through a section of the city that was built up during the communist rule in the 1970's and 1980's. Then on to some park areas in/above the city where we caught some beautiful scenery of the countryside and of the city itself. Do yourself a favor and sign up for one of the tours with these guys, it's a great way to spend a few hours and see a different perspective of the city! I will definitely be coming back for more next time I'm in Prague!"

Although I usually do a short tour to familiarise myself with a city, I generally have less interest in buildings and monuments, and more interest in the contemporary culture and authentic experiences. I also like the outdoors aspects of a city. The blocks and parks tour with Marek ticked all my boxes. We saw parts of the city outside the central district that few tourists would ever see, it's a taste of real life for real locals. The other part of the tour is the amazing parkland that surrounds Prague. You get to do some real mountain bike riding along tracks through fields and forests and it's great fun. Make sure you dress for the outdoors. You will see some great views. Finally, Marek was a great guide, he speaks perfect English having lived in the UK and is a really easy going and good humoured guy. It requires a little bit of hard work so is also a good workout which you will need after all the food in Prague. So if you want an authentic view of life in Prague and to get away from the tourist masses (and to get a bit of exercise) then I can't recommend the blocks and parks tour highly enough."

Our tour was one of the easier ones. Also not very sporty people could easily follow the trip thanks to electric bikes. But it was challenging enough to feel tired afterwards, which was good for us who spend most of the time at work sitting at our desks. The only thing I could complain about, was that the tour was delayed almost an hour, but it was not actually Biko Adventures' fault - they had to borrow some electric bikes from another company, as we were a big group, and someone from the other company was late. I would recommend taking such a trip to anyone, who wants to spend an active day in Prague, not necessarily in the most common and crowded tourist spots."

It was so neat to see the transition from city to country over the course of the 23 mi bike trip. Whenever the wind really shook the trees, a cloud of delicate white flowers would float down around us- I felt like I was in a dream. The route was just beautiful: following 2 rivers, through green pastures, stopping at a wonderful country bakery, past a stone monastery all the way out to the base of the Castle. Our guide Adam is a very smart Prague college student, and he was knowledgeable and accommodating for the many hours of our tour. Adam took our group of 4 to a wonderful restaurant with a view of the castle and gave us plenty of time to walk around the castle and its beautiful grounds. We took the train back to Prague (good planning on their part!) and had a fun quick pedal through the city to get from the train station to their shop. Fillipo managed our tour selection and reservation process via email. They have tours to suit everybody from couch potato to triathlete, and the Karlstejn Classic was the perfect tour for us. Like many of the interesting and creative people in Prague, Fillipo also has a passion for design. He designed and printed the Biko T shirts for sale in the shop which look beautiful and have fun design references to major architectural styles of the city. We each bought a shirt, and I thought is was so great that each shirt came with its own hand made tag that gave a fun history lesson about the architecture that inspired it.We had such a great time that we tried to do the Prague Parks tour the next day. We were rained out (little did we know the flood was coming 48 hours later). For our next visit, I will schedule our Biko tour during the early park of our trip so we can have a make up day in case of rain. Thanks for a great experience, and we hope to see Adam, Filipo, and the Biko team again!"

Myself and my fiance booked the Prague Parks Advanced tour late the night before we wanted to go, and Biko were accommodating enough to take us. We were greeted by our guide, and Biko owner, Filippo who showed us the beautiful parks Prague has to offer. The tour was definitely, 100%, without-a-doubt THE best thing I have done in Europe. We saw a part of Prague that very few tourists would see and had several amazing panoramic views of the old town square and Charles bridge. Filippo was really friendly, offering knowledge and a bit of the history of Prague. He made us feel really comfortable and was super down to earth.Initially, I though 37kms would be tough to ride, but a lot of it was flat or downhill (aside from the big up hill at the start) and there are plenty of breaks along the way to rest if needed.I would recommend this tour to anyone without any hesitation, it was absolutely fantastic! Thanks Filippo!From Andrew & Jemma from Australia"

My husband loves to bike, but I'm not such a huge fan (I fall down a lot, even when standing still), so as a treat for my husband we booked a bike tour with Filippo to Karlstejn Castle from Prague. Before the tour Filippo assured us that if the biking was too much for me I could catch the local train to the castle, which is what sold me on such an ambitious journey. Sure enough, at the first opportunity to catch the train I had to do so, but the first half of the ride was still really fun for me and certainly for my husband! Filippo feels like an old friend the moment you meet him and he couldn't have been a better person to spend the day with! Once we all met up at the train station we rode into Karlstejn and my husband and I got a chance to walk up the hill to the castle. At the end of the day we all rode the train back into Prague. As we rode from the station back to the bike shop Filippo pointed out a great Italian spot to eat at, which is where we ended up having dinner and it was fantastic! If you like biking (or your significant other likes biking and you're a good sport) I'd highly recommend taking a tour with Filippo. It was the highlight of our vacation!"

I had gotten in contact with Fillipo about 3 weeks before my trip to see about renting a bike. They did not have the exact bike I was looking for, but the interactions and the hospitality that Fillipo displayed trying to help me out was very impressive to me. I was so pleased that I decided to try the mountain bike Prague Parks Advanced tour instead since the road bike was not yet ready.I spoke with Fillipo back and forth through email for days leading up to the tour. We talked so much I felt like I was meeting a friend by the time I came to his shop.The tour was a fantastic mix of sight-seeing through some of the best parks in Prague and major tourist attractions. He was willing to go as fast or as slow as I wanted to, stop to take photos and explain the history of the area to me. I love being able to ride a bike so to be able to learn so much about Prague while on a bike was great for me.The tours are set up so even someone who rarely rides a bike could easily enjoy one of the easier versions of the tours without missing much of the history and sight-seeing. This was what impressed me the most. There is also some very difficult sections for people like me who love to test themselves.I am from the USA where customer service is not at a very high level anymore. Fillipo is a genuinely nice guy who loves to show people the city in a fun and unique way. I was more than happy to spend the first half of my day with him, especially because it was obvious that his main goal was to make me happy and be sure that I enjoyed myself in Prague. This was refreshing!I will definitely be back. If ta tour with Biko is not on your \"must do\" list for a trip to Prague, you are missing out!"

Filippo was fantastic from the very first email - friendly, knowledgeable, professional. He made everything so easy - from pre-booking all the kit, to offering biscuits and a thermos of delicious tea on the drive up to the mountains. We had never tried cross-country skiing before, so it was great to feel like we were in good hands, with a friendly guide and someone who had a real passion for the outdoors. We did a 16km route - enough to work up a great appetite for some hearty home-cooked Czech food in a fantastic traditional mountain cabin.We would 110% recommend Biko. I can't wait to go again and am already looking forward to mountain biking in the summer."

            "review": "Two more fantastic days...... The week before Christmas was my third trip to Prague and the second time that I had chosen to spend some time with Filippo and Biko tours. Yet again it proved to be an inspired decision.Filippo was as helpful as ever in when trying to decide on which activities to do, clearly weather conditions are a consideration at this time of year. Communication in advance of my arrival was excellent, Fillippo emailed frequently with options and suggestions and some pictures to help with the decision making and was happy for the final decision to be made the day before I arrived in the Czech Republic.I chose to try cross country skiing on my first day with Biko and Filippo. I was picked up from my hotel, Mamaison Riverside is just round the corner from where Biko is based so is ideal, and we set off at a rather early 7 a.m. The early start was to avoid the rush hour into Prague, and this allowed us swift progress to the northern region of the Czech Republic called the Jizerske Mountains. Coffee stop en route and we arrived at 9 a.m. This was my first time cross country skiing and the last time I was ever on skis must have been some 20 years ago. Equipment hire was all organised by Filippo and went as smoothly as anything else he organises. I took the suggested option of a lesson with an instructor; this would be a sensible option for any novice. Filippo skied with me that day, though I believe the tour is normally not guided. The scenery was stunning, despite the early morning mist. This area is off the beaten track with limited numbers of tourists, another opportunity to see the real Czech Republic! We had a lunch stop at a ski house where a hearty meal was served and it would be rude not to supplement the lunch with a beer. After 16 km of skiing we were back to the car for the journey back to Prague. A great day was had, as a total novice I found the day physically challenging \u2013 but that\u2019s what I wanted \u2013 to try something new and see what it was all about. As always Filippo was considerate of my ability and adapted the route accordingly. Despite his best efforts at some extra tuition though, I still never mastered the perfect technique! Well done for tying Filippo!I had two days arranged with Biko and for the second chose the option of hiking. This was at the Czech paradise, or rock city, which is a Unesco world heritage site. An early morning start, once again, allowed us to avoid the Prague commuter traffic. A slightly shorter journey than the skiing trip by car, and a coffee stop en route, got us to the area in good time. This was the day the world was supposed to end... so what better place to spend it than in the wilds of the Czech countryside. The hiking was fantastic, the weather was cold but bright, the routes well signposted and paths well maintained. As described on the Biko web site, the rock formations and mysterious valleys are magical and well worth a visit. Fillipo and I were the only people there which added to the surreal atmosphere. The end of the world arrived and went with no major catastrophe despite the fact we waited with a view over the valley and the rocks to meet our end at the predicted time..... hiking over we headed off to the local town for another authentic Czech lunch, a walk around the square then the trip back to Prague.Both trips were followed up with a brilliant action photo reportage to add to your memories of a great day. As many other have said the tour organisation is fantastic, nothing is too much trouble, the activities are well thought out and planned and you cannot help to feed off the infectious enthusiasm that Filippo has for the great outdoors. The web site is brilliant with clear instruction, guidance and transparent pricing, and offers great value for money in my opinion. The personal service that Biko gives means I\u2019ll be back on my next visit to Prague \u2013 many thanks again Filippo for such a memorable couple of days!"

Unique experience, fun guide and friendly customer service. Best way to see Prague while being active and not the typical tourist attraction. Filippo will take excellent photos of your journey for free and send them to you ! A big plus! Highly recommended.Read below if you want the full details *it's long*After visiting the main sights in Prague's city center and Old Town, I wanted something other than the typical tourist experience - this is where Biko Tours came through to elevate my Prague trip to a whole new level. Filippo Mari is the entrepreneur and owner of Biko Tours - designing guided tours on high quality bikes to bring people to the outer edges of Prague - tours for different activity levels (easy / med/ advanced) and various bike routes to off the beaten track destinations. He's created several themes, routes and itineraries for each tour, i.e \"Parks and Blocks\" tour to visit Prague's great city parks, or the \"Road to Karljsten Castle\" which winds its way through the country side to the famous castle. Each route is unique and Filippo strives to make each ride a new experience, so it's not just a \"cookie cutter\" route. I stayed in Prague during low season (late Nov), so I wasn't sure there were tours still running. Turns out I was the only one who requested for a tour that day, but Filippo went out of his way to take me anyway. I received a private tour (low season has its perks!) but even during peak season, I'd imagine you will receive the same level of undivided attention since he limits his tour groups to 8-10 ppl and makes sure there are 2 guides so everyone is taken care of. Prior to the excursion, he responded on email very promptly and made sure I had all my questions answered, and took great care to email me exact directions from my hotel to the bike shop.On the actual tour, he spends time tailoring the itinerary to what you want to see. He goes at apace you're comfortable with, whether you prefer easier paved trails, or want to amp it up with off road mountain biking for advanced riders, Filippo knows so many different routes that everyone will have a good time without feeling rushed or pressured. Above all, you will be SAFE. He makes sure that everyone is comfortable and no one is left behind. We rode for 35 km starting off in Prague (Andel neighborhood) and biked our way through pretty villages, bridges, and country roads so I could see what life is like outside Prague. The journey was peaceful, picturesque and charming. Filippo led me through hidden trails off the main road so I can catch a glimpse of the best views, something only locals of the area would know about.Filippo will photo-document the trip (he calls it reportage) so you don't have to stop at every picturesque vista to snap a photo. On the other hand, if you are a snap-happy photographer and want to stop every 10 feet, he'll be patient so you can get all the shots you want! What I love about the reportage is you'll finally get to be in the picture - one of the perks if you're traveling alone so you don't have to ask someone else to take a photo for you, or set up your tripod. His photography is creative and professional - Check out his cool website at www.bikotours.com for more information and a photo gallery. He designed it himself and his eye for creative details shows through because he is a former marketing/design manager. Unlike a jaded tour guide, he really seems to care and want to learn more about your culture, your story and is very knowledgable about Prague life, history, and Czech culture. So, in addition to getting an active experience, you'll also get a good dose of education! We even went to hidden little bakery where they gave us free donuts and baked goods!I had an amazing time and highly recommend his company. Biking is the best way to see a city and the countryside, since you can travel so much farther on a bike than on foot. Go visit Prague with Biko Tours!"

I have been living in Prague for years and I only recently found out about Filippo and Biko Adventures through a friend...and I am so glad I did! To begin, Filippo is incredibly down-to-earth, caring, accommodating and fun, making the hours spent on the trail highly enjoyable and relaxed. He provides a nice balance by letting you be in control and fulfilling his role as an experienced biker/ tour guide. On the trail I asked him if we could stop many times for pictures, I let him know if I needed something like water, and at the end when I was getting tired I just told him this is my pace and I could not go faster. He is there the whole way making sure you have a good time! Also, Filippo really goes above and beyond by taking high-end digital pictures of you along the way...and then he sends them to you after so you have really nice memories of your tour. This guy is really stellar and it reflects throughout the whole tour.The trail itself was a combination of the advanced and easy tour, as I was the first customer of this new route. I love beer, thus I wanted to do this tour in specific. The Uneticke brewery (pivovar) that you bike to dates back to 1710 and produces a very smooth and drinkable lager. The food at lunch is made from produce and farms right there in town - sustainability! Its nice for you as a tourist, you can also see a small town and how the people there live. And as the Czechs do consume the most beer per capita than any other country in the world, this tour is very fitting as you will experience one of the most important part of the Czech culture...their beer!If you have already done the city center, are tired of the masses of people and want to see more of our beautiful city and all the wild nature it has to offer I cannot recommend this or any of Filippo's tours enough! Thank you Filippo for letting me be your guinea pig!"

We had a lunch in just on the right spot on the ride, it isn\u2019t mandatory, but I think that the rest of the ride wouldn\u2019t be so enjoyable without proper Czech country side meal. As a physical workout the Great Escape is good, but not too hard that you couldn\u2019t do anything else on the same day.

That is until I booked a mountain biking tour with Bikoadventures in early October. I am a very fit and competitive road cyclist.

I met my guide Filippo at the shop the morning of the ride I was immediately put at ease by his friendly and easy going manner. When we began our ride I was also very impressed by Filippo's ability to quickly assess my off road skill set and customize the existing route to keep me out of trouble, yet still allow me to enjoy a strenuous workout.  In addition to a physical experience, it was clear to me that Filippo wanted me to be inspired on an emotional level. \"The Great Escape\" has a great deal of beautiful scenery and thought provoking sights. I will never forget riding along a pasture where sheep were grazing and later stopping near acres of freshly tilled farm land to view an old Communist housing development in the distance. Throughout the ride Filippo acted as a guide and a generous host. He is truly a warm and friendly person who is very concerned about providing his customers with a memorable riding experience. So road riders have no fear, and put a ride with Bikoadventures at the top of your to do list when you visit Prague."

A true professional, Filippo provided a truly unique, incredibly fun, full day bike tour which you will not find elsewhere! My husband and I experienced beautiful, out of the ordinary locations, views, scenery as well as delicious local cuisine. I sing my highest praises to Filippo's ability and the product he has put together. The bikes and equipment are of highest quality. Filippo even had back packs for us! While we enjoyed Filippo's delightful company during the ride; his concern for detail, customer service and our well being was evident from my first communication with him through email. After our ride, he sent us fabulous photos which recorded our day! If you enjoy biking, as we do....we HIGHLY recommend a Biko tour! In fact, don't miss out...it will be A DAY TO REMEMBER!!!! IT WAS THE BEST!!!!!  A&M Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania"

I take Prague Parks tour so I have seen Prague on some different way. It was a great ride with great people. I rode with Filippo and John. They boot were very kind and friendly. Filippo is the owner and he is the right person for this job, he contacted me before the ride and tell me all informations. After the ride he send me beautiful photographs. He is so helpful and beautiful person, so I have really enjoyed ride with him. The ride last about 6 hours, and I have smiled whole the time...I couldn't take of a smile from my face for a rest of the day!Thank you Filippo and John for a great memories!Warmly , I recommend to everyone who like to ride a bike in friendly company, and who want to explore beauty of Prague!"

We are by no means expert bikers, and with my wife being 6 months pregnant, we took Fillippo's recommendation for the Karlstejn tour. The 35 kilometers were no problem for her and Fillippo made it clear from the beginning that we were the boss and could stop and go at our own pace. It was great to traverse through Prague, the surrounding villages, and the countryside in the fresh air and not from the inside of a car or train. I highly recommend this to anyone who is looking for something away from the big crowds and touristy activities straight from the travel guide. Fillippo is a great guide and passionate about what he does. His carefully crafted route was a unique and rewarding experience. We also really enjoyed our photo reportage to remember our BIKO adventure."

I spent 6 days in Prague, two of them spent with Biko. Filippo was my tour guide and I did the parks and blocks and the great escape advanced. The tour descriptions are covered on the web site in detail so I won\u2019t repeat here. Both were amazing experiences. The chance to see elements of Prague, beyond the usual tourist haunts, that so many fail to see was inspiring and incredibly enjoyable.Filippo is an incredibly engaging guide, and obviously passionate about mountain biking and the great outdoors. He provides enough information to describe the tour but also leaves time to take in the wonderful views, scenery and architecture. The tours are all his own design and he has managed to put together a brilliant mix of exciting single track runs through woodland countryside, open park cycling, key points of interest and Prague suburbia, truly outstanding. I\u2019ve shared the included reportage with a few friends and they think the pictures are a fantastic record of my adventures and I will treasure them together with the memories of my trips for a long time.On a practical side, the tours are very well organised, consideration is taken of the riders ability and tours can easily be adapted so don\u2019t these are just for the hardcore mountain biker. Communication is great, Fillipo texted regularly to make sure we were OK to go and confirmed I was happy. If you forget some of your gear (as I did) Biko have very reasonably priced replacements.This was my second visit to Prague and I was delighted to have chosen to spend two days with Filipo. I can\u2019t think of anything better that could compare on a \u2018things to do in Prague\u2019 list than the tours with Biko. Businesses that offer this level of service and quality experience deserve all the praise they can get. I will definitely be back whenever I am in Prague again, and if you have a spare day or two then get yourself along I\u2019d be amazed how anyone could not have a fantastic time."

Biko Adventures is a professional outfit and Filippo a true professional. \u00a0We were supplied with excellent bikes - not the usual clunkers we got when renting in Europe - and helmets. \u00a0It was just the two of us and Filippo, which we much prefer to large, impersonal tour groups and which allowed us to bike at our own pace. The tour begins on the edge of downtown Prague and the route is planned meticulously to avoid both the cobblestoned congestion of the tourist core and busy roads thereafter. The path quickly gives way to Czech countryside, far from the hustle and bustle of the old city. \u00a0It traverses dirt and gravel paths, small side roads, river banks and bridges. \u00a0We stopped for lunch at a wonderfully authentic small Czech restaurant, where we enjoyed a cool pint of beer and fried cheese\u00a0- must-try! - on the patio. \u00a0Karlstejn itself was an interesting visit but the majority of the fun was the journey itself, including Filippo's insights and sense of humour. \u00a0He loves what he does and it shows. \u00a0We highly recommend this tour to cyclists of all levels - we're talking flat route - as the perfect way to escape the crowds and souvenir shops of Prague and discover a different side to the city's environs."

During the first day we completed a great deal of sight seeing and we really wanted to see more of the surrounding country. We therefore signed up for the Karlstejn BIKO tour. As a regular cyclist, I was rather apprehensive at first as I don't really like guided tours however, this one is TOTALLY different. Filippo is an excellent, unassuming guide who knows how to get the best out of a tour for his individual customers. We learnt so much about the country and about the Czech way of life. We were able to appreciate the beauty of the surrounding area outside the lovely city (particularly loved the bridges!). Many thanks to Filippo, Denisa and Daniele for a truly inspiring and wonderful day. I would recommend this tour for cyclists of ALL abilities and the bikes were great.Carl and Claire Garton (Jersey,UK)"

We came upon BIKO Adventures and figured we'd give it a shot. Overall I would rate this company very well. Our bikes were in god shape, the guide was very nice and knowledgable and we had a great time. The trip was very flat and along nice trails or roads and along the river for the most part. We stopped for a nice traditional Czech meal along the way and got to see the Karlstejn castle at the end. Our guide also took some great photos of us along the way. The trip back from Karstejn is on a train in which the guide also paid for (it was included in the 57 \u20ac price). Next time if I went back I would challenge myself with the single track ride or the Offroad Karlstejn trip. If you are an experienced rider you will find this ride very easy, but beautiful for an enjoying day trip. The views along the ride and over a rail bridge are one of a kind. I would recommend for couples or groups."

If you are the sort of person who likes biking, but nothing too strenuous, this trip is an utter joy. Whilst 35km might seem daunting, this route is almost totally flat, has minimal time anywhere other than cycle paths and offers plenty of opportunities to stop en route. Out two kids would readily have cycled back. The countryside is beautiful as is the approach to Karlstejn.Filippo is an outstanding guide and looked after us all very well. We travelled at our own pace and stopped as and when we felt the need.This is that \"something different\" you always want to do on holiday. So, rather than talk about it, book the tour and enjoy a little more of this beautiful country than you would otherwise see. And, while I am sure there are other bike tours in Prague, this is the ONLY one you should consider.Planning now to get fitter and try the hills next time!"

My wife and I recent spent a week in Prague and one of the highlights of our travels was a day spent with Biko Adventures mountain bike tours. We chose the Karlstejn Castle Classic tour and really enjoyed it. We enjoy bike riding, but we are not \"hard core\" mountain bikers. That tour was perfect for us. If, on the other hand, you are a truly avid mountain biker, they have a variety of unique tour offerings to suit your skills as well.Our tour lasted for about 7 hours. The company owner, Filippo, emailed me prior to the tour and gave me explicit directions to his shop. Our guide met us at the tram stop and walked us over to the shop, about 2 blocks away. On bicycles, we left from their shop in Prague and the bicycle riding part of the tour ended at Karlstejn Castle, a picturesque \"fairtale-like\" place in the country. We then traveled by train with our bikes back to Prague. This was a truly private tour with just my wife and me and our guide. The pace was whatever we wanted it to be and was completely in-line with our abilities. We made a stop for lunch at a quaint local Czech restaurant (with excellent food!) We were offered to stop whenever and where ever we wanted...even to swim in the river if we chose to do that. At the Castle, our guide (Martin) watched our bikes for us while we walked the remaining distance up to the Castle. After visiting the Castle, we met up with another private tour (one of the more difficult off road tours) being guided by the company owner (Filippo) and we all stopped together for a drink and a snack right by the Castle. We then all took the train together back to Prague.I highly recommend this company for a unique and really fun experience while in Prague. The tours are truly customized to each individual's desires and abilities. We wanted a scenic, leisurely, fun bike ride through the country and that is exactly what we got. If you prefer a challenging off-road experience, they have that too.Finally, Filippo runs a very good business. He communicates well, responds to emails quickly, is personable, and he appears to truly love what he does. As a bonus, after the tour, he sends a file with photos that the guide takes during the ride.I highly recommend Biko. Please feel free to email with any questions."

It's an incredible way to experience Prague, get some exercise, and of course ride some killer singletrack. In addition to designing great routes, my Biko guide (Filippo) was a skilled, knowledgeable, and incredibly gracious guide who did everything he could (and indeed even more that he probably should have) to make my ride perfect. I've hired MTB guides all over the world, and Filippo is as good as they come. Totally fluent in English and Italian (and probably other languages with which I am unfamiliar)."

How refreshing to not be in the middle of a large crowd at a tourist stop! We would periodically take a stop for a bottle of water along the 3-4 hour ride. We eventually reached the town of Karlstejn with the beauiful castle almost floating in the clouds at the top of a hill. I took a tour of the castle and enjoyed both this and the wonderful views from the top. Filippo then had a great lunch recommendation which we enjoyed outside on a deck.

On our recent vacation to Prague, my wife and I wanted to get out and see the Czech countryside and despite being occasional bikers opted for a bike tour with Biko to Karlstejn castle. What a wonderful decision! Beyond choosing a varied 3 - 4 hr route of not-too strenuous biking with gorgeous scenery of rivers, farms, breweries, and bridges, Filippo literally insures that you have a phenomenal experience. In our case this went as far as literally sawing a bike seat-stem prior to our setting out to make sure for a perfect fit ! Filippo always has the client in mind by doing all the little things such as tempering the route, pace, and rest breaks to the riders - and most important of all does not mix groups to insure individualized attention. He also is quite the photographer and sends you a great set of photos at the end. During the trip, we also had ample time to discuss and learn about day to day life in the Czech Republic and see many families enjoying biking, roller-blading, etc. So, getting to that picture perfect castle at the end was almost anti-climactic (but worth the visit too). Definitely will take another ride with Biko next time we are in Prague - and you should too."

The whole day was very relaxed, and fun, we learned a lot, and saw many things that the standard Prague tourist never even hears about. First rate all the way, and I am already considering a return trip for the Singletrack Paradise..."

            "review": "The higlight of our weekend.... A friend and I booked up the Road to Karljstein off-road during a long weekend trip to Prague in late November 2011 (an unusually mild one!). I was a little anxious about doing the off-road version as I didn't have any previous off-roading experience, but it appealed to me more than the on-road version and my more experienced off-roader buddy assured me I'd be fine, so we decided to go for it. The description on the website is pretty much spot on. It is pretty hard going in places, with some tough up hills and exhilarating downs. It probably pays to be relatively fit, and either fairly experienced / brave / stupid (like me) for some of the more hairy down hill sections. I can also add that from experience, going on a guided beer tour the night before and consuming large amounts of Czech beer is not the best preparation for this trip (although it does make for a damn good night out!). We met our excellent guide Filippo at a local bike hire shop, as it was out of season so his regular bikes had gone back. After a short Metro ride to the outskirts of Prague, our journey began through one of the old Communist suburbs. After the first of three 'substantial' up hills (a good hangover cure!), we soon hit the forest and the true off-road tracks. I found it fascinating looking at the little cottages we passed scattered in the middle of the forest, a throw back to Communist times, when foreign holidays were not an option. Some parts of the forest were a bit on the muddy side (hardly surprising given the time of year), which made for some tricky riding but excellent fun. Upon leaving the first section of forest we soon passed a small herd of deer grazing in a field next to the road, which was a bonus, before passing through some smaller more traditional Czech villages. Next followed one of the most gruelling sections of the trip, a seemingly never-ending up hill along the side of a field. Thankfully this section also has some of the most beautiful scenery, so you have a good excuse to take regular 'photo stops' to get your breath back. At this point in the trip you have a decision to make... take on another up hill and go to see the canyon, or head straight to the castle. Rather surprisingly we had just about enough energy at this point to go for the canyon option, and I'm glad we did as it's a beautiful spot and well worth checking out. The final forest section has the most exhilarating down hill of the trip, which really gets your adrenaline going. Finally the forest clears to reveal the stunning Karljstein castle looming up right in front of you. It really is a spectacular sight, and makes the all the effort worth while. We had just enough time in Karljstein to have a quick look around the castle before grabbing some food, and catching the train back to Prague. During the entire trip Filippo (also the creator of BIKO) was very informative about the places we visited, and we made regular stops for him to point out things of interest. Although he's only lived in Prague for a few years he really knows his history, and it's clear he is very passionate about it. Nothing was too much trouble for the guy, and he is a very warm and friendly character. On top of all of this he's also a talented photographer, and within a couple of days he had e-mailed me a set of professionally processed photos of the trip, what a bonus! In summary, if you like biking and getting outdoors, or just fancy doing something a bit different then I can't recommend BIKO tours enough. Whether you go for one of the easier on-road, or a more demanding off-road tour, it's a fantastic way of seeing a different side of Prague (and beyond)."

I spent the first part of my trip seeing the traditional sights such as Prague Castle, Jewish Quarter, the Charles Bridge, etc. It was facinating, but I felt herded like cattle along with the masses of other tourists. My last full day in Prague I did \"The Great Escape\" expedition with Biko. It was fantastic! In addition to a great workout, I saw post-war communist buildings, amazing back roads, local farms, an abandoned bomb shelter, some great single-track, lunch near a farmer's market in a rural village, and a scenic ride back along the Vltava river. We returned to Prague mid-afternoon and the falling sun illuminating the buildings along the river was gorgeous! I take pictures as a hobby and never felt rushed by Filippo, who was a fantastic guide. Overall, it was a great workout, an amazing education and I have some unique pictures of Prague to share with friends and family back home. Highly recommended!"

As a long term citizen of Prague I was very surprised to discover how much of the country side I was missing out on after I took the BIKO trip to Karlstein castle. It was a great summers day and BIKO made the most of it. The route combined witha little improvisation was well tailored to the group's needs; swimming in the river, stopping for some cold beer with sausage and of course when we finished a great garden lunch at the castle. BIKO trips are perfect for those who like to see the city and its surroundings. They offer an alternitive point of view in an active yet still very relaxing way. Even though I went on this trip on my own, the guide made me feel welcome and part of the group immediately. He always tried to accomodate everyones needs. The guide and owner of BIKO company is the one lovely, enthusiastic and inspiring Italian. BIKO trips are highly recommended not only for forigners discovering the Czech Republic but also for adventurous Czechs."

Tours start in the heart of the city, but rather than just taking you through the sights of the city you will adventure outside to the surrounding countryside. It's really beautiful, the guides are fun, the pivo alongside the road is ice cold and there is a fabulous adventure awaiting you should you decide to take one of these trips! Ciao"

He has developed some unique tours of the city that are suitable for all levels of biking. Filippo is a charming Italian who will show and tell you about each park feature that you visit. A tour with him is unique and a special experience.On a beautiful day in June, in a couple hours of easy biking, we visited a number of the parks around Prague and even took a small ferry across the Vltava. It allowed me to get a new perspective of Prague and it's hidden beauty. I was able to visit some unusual sites in Prague that I would not have seen if I had been a tourist on foot.

On my visit to Prague, I decided to book an e-bike tour of Prague for the adventure of trying something new and the prospect of covering vast areas quickly. My tour was with Mike, a very friendly, laid back and cool guy who gave me and the group an introduction to the bikes and opportunity to test ride it. The tour itself was full of thrills and exciting challenges, such as navigating out par way through some crowded and uphill areas while adjusting to the quirky and powerful features of the bike. Being in a small and very sociable group felt like it was an outing among friends and Mike took us to very beautiful and rarely visited places in Prague like the football training ground with an interesting Soviet past, the monastic drinking brewery, and some stunning viewing points. Mike was never rushed and keen to have us savour each place we visited and was great company when we did take a break and have a beer. Mike gave us opportunity as a group to socialise and was very patient with our adjustment to the bikes. Overall, it was an extremely enjoyable tour and one I would strongly recommend with Mike who is a fantastic guide. Thank you Mike!"

It is a once in a lifetime experience, which I still am talking about as probably my favorite part of visiting Prague.After taking this tour, I did book the tour in Budapest. There was no comparison.

The Ebikes were fun and allowed us to cover so much ground we would have otherwise missed during our short Prague visit. All that being said, Jan really was the best part!

You'll see areas of Prague you'd never find as a tourist and I don't think any or many other tours would include the suburbs to get a feel for real life. A meal in a local suburban pub, a traditional Czech meal was great to try - it was a really cool experience. (The meal is at your own expense but very cheap and tasty) The bikes are of high quality and really well looked after. Small group sizes - there was on my partner and I in the group and I believe they mentioned most groups are about 4 or 5 people. "

Patrick was a lot of fun; informative, happy to suggest photo spots and take snaps for us, adapted his style and language to his audience and added charisma to the day. The tour itself was fun - we saw places we would have never seen on our own.Lunch was a good, traditional experience. I can't say I'm in love with Czech food but we enjoyed trying something authentic. The e bikes were fun. Took a few goes to get used to it but in a few minutes, we were loving it! Definitely recommend over segways which are banned in many parts of Prague and mostly just annoy other people. Price seemed reasonable and fair, especially for 5 hours. Would recommend this tour to friends in a second."

The bikes were very easy to handle and in great condition. We opted for the 5hr tour which was great. It was the best way to see Prague.

The chance to talk to Mike as well as the other couple on the tour who were from Belgium, about life in Prague and life in Europe was very enjoyable.

I have traveled to many European cities and loved this concept. This tour gives you an entire overview of what the city has to offer. What makes it special is the tour guide \u2013 Jan. He was very informative about the attractions, but the best part was his insight into every day culture in Prague. Ask him anything, and he has a great story to tell. He was very patient when we took a little longer at some stops and he was always concerned for our well- being. You might be thinking \u201chow can I bike for 5 hours\u201d . . . These bikes are equipped with small motors that give you just enough push to get up hills and terrain effortlessly. There are baskets on the bike for a coat or package, but a backpack is the easiest. Even after the tour was over, my daughter and I asked him about restaurants and night life options and he was filled with great suggestions. He had such an easy going nature and great sense of humor and was always happy to take pictures for us. If you are a little early for your tour, there are great restaurants just a walk away from the bike shop. This was the highlight of our Prague experience and Jan made the magic happen."

We went to the top of Petrin Hill, rode around the outskirts of Prague Castle and toured up to Letna Park where there was a beer garden and a cool hip area where the locals hang out. We ended our trip at the John Lennon wall. Our guide Mike was awesome- super friendly, knowledgeable and clearly had a love for his city. He provided us with a history of each area we visited and offered up personal stories of his own impressions of the city. We had lots of photo op's and saw parts of the city that we would never have seen on our own including a brief visit to the now abandoned Straha stadium built in the 60's when the country was under communist rule. Fascinating! I highly recommend this bike tour for kids in particular. Both my kids loved it and said it was the highlight of their trip."

Again the bikes were great and the guide amazing. Mike took us on a journey that was very off the beaten path for tourists.

Both Jan and Tomas were fantastic tour guides with so much knowledge about the cultural and political history of Prague. Everyone in the group learned something and had a fantastic time on the tour. And at the end of the tour they went over a map of the city and provided us with information on the best restaurants, ice cream, and other sites to see.

We had a great time.Therefore when in Prague and looking for a great afternoon exploring the city, get on this tour!One tiny remark for those of you planning to do this city tour: the tour doesn't really cover the Old City part of Prague. Which is better to walk through anyway."

We did bicycle tours in other histories with just as much history, but for both our 9 year old son and us this was the highlight of the vacation.The e-bikes are just the only way to see a city like Prague now. It was our first time on e-bikes, and a bit nerve racking to start as they are more powerful than you would think (despite the 75km range from a tiny batter), but after the first 100m become very easy and just a joy to use on both hills and flat alike.The bikes are modern, US-origin, and well-maintained, and allow one to focus on the sights. We saw 7 of all 10 Prague boroughs, and covered so much ground and yet felt the tour was nicely slow paced and could probably have been done in half the time if one was in a rush.Jan was a wonderful host, both concerned about our enjoyment and well-being (suggesting a longer rest stop at the monastery, recommending an order of hot dogs at the beer garden, and even suggesting a cheap football/soccer game that evening at AC Sparta).He took another 20 minutes after the tour to create indivualized maps of Prague with his recommendations for each of the two parties in the tour. Since we had a child they often do a private tour at no additional charge, but in this case we were with one other family that worked out well.There is so much to see in Prague, but we felt we got a taste not just of the historic sights (e..g., timing to see the Changing of the Guard at the Palace) but also seeing the basic student dorms, the world's largest stadium where the propaganda gymanastic videos were shot, and much more.Prague became our 9 year old's favorite city really because of this tour, and he is already planning the return visit.Any fitness level is fine for these bikes. So much more efficient and effective than the Segue tours."

( and on this same trip we took two other similar tours in two different cities) partick was just wonderful, he took time to explain everything, and also to answer all of our questions, a very knowledgeable young man, taking a serious interest in his job. we had walked prague for two days, but could NEVER have seen all we did without the convenience of the electric bike tour. prague became even more beautiful and interesting to us as the morning went on. we covered an amazing amount of territory at a leisurely pace. patrick was very obliging in taking pictures of us at all the stops. the lunch stop was great too, if a little early. well, we had had a full breakfast and the food was plentiful. so if you aren't overly hungry, order one plate for two. the price for lunch is not included. so again, just let me emphasize the professionalism of patrick, and the chosen sites and route are tops! i would ride with i like e bikes again in a minute!"

This was our first trip to Prague and I cannot stress enough how important this bike tour was to the success of our the entirety of the trip. JAN IS THE BEST! We had no idea what were getting ourselves into when we signed up for this trip other than that it'd be on electronic bikes. There are a few different types of routes you can select and we chose to scenic one ( I plan on coming back and picking a different one!) and spent 5, almost 6 hours exploring the most beautiful city in Europe. It wasn't just the views and the architecture that blew us away, but the knowledge and pride Jan had of Prague was astounding. A Prague resident who knows 5 different languages, Jan paired his sense of humor and sheer knowledge of his beloved city by creating the most informative tour I have ever been apart of. We booked our tour for a group of 3 and were lucky enough to have us and Jan for the entire trip. We felt safe and secure the entire time and it was clear that Jan was an experienced tour guide. It didn't feel like a proper tour guide though, it felt like, by the end of it,we made a true friend and discovered/learned about one of the most incredible cities in all of Europe. I cannot stress enough how amazing this trip was and it had EVERYTHING to with the I Like EBike experience.What to bring: Sun Glasses (weather permitting), Shoes or sneakers, a camera, a sweatshirt (weather permitting), cash for a drink and/or food at the biggest beer garden in Prague, a smile, a willingness to explore. Jan had a bottle of water for us each once we arrived and offered us the usage of the restroom as well. He even let us charge our phones while we got everything set up for the trip. The bikes come with a big basket in the front, so you can store your water, sweatshirt, bags, etc."

I was skeptical about their claim that you could bike up and down hills without breaking a sweat, but they were right! The electric pedal assist really works well. On flat areas you can leave the assist on a low setting (2 or 3), and on steep hills you can bump it up to 5 and the bike climbs the hill easily. Our guide, Charles, was a resident and really gave us a great tour. We covered many areas in Prague during our five hour tour, from areas around the Old Town to the giant stadium to the castle district and more. It was very interesting and with the e-bikes we didn't feel tired after 5 hours of biking, despite some VERY steep hills. The tour was also nice because there were only 3 of us on it total--it felt really personalized. This is a great way to experience the city at a very close level. We would definitely recommend it to others who want to get a detailed overview of Prague."

During a one week vacation in Prague I wanted to rent a bike and found ILIKEEBIKE office/shop very close to our accommodation.The company requires a minimum rental period of 5 hours (which is fair deal) for a very comfortable bicycle with electric motor and front wheel suspension.On my suggestion to split the contract into two hours today and three hours tomorrow the answer was \"Yes Sir, of course we can do that\".Two days later I made the same agreement again (renting same bike for additional five hours over two days), but this time I even got a rebate of 90 czk without signing additional formal contract.This is an example of excellent customer service, thank you ILIKEEBIKE.I can really recommend you experience Prague by bicycle on your own (or guided tour if first visit). A bicycle supported by electric motor is actually better (and much cheaper) than a Segway if you want to cover distances beyond walking.Try it !!"

We are late 50\u2019s \u2013 early 60\u2019s and have traveled Europe a fair amount. For this tour, we were picked up at a central location in Prague and were driven in a small van to the e-bike tour\u2019s office. We met the staff, chose our bikes and were given a demonstration about how to control them. I am the least mechanically inclined of the group and a small woman, and when I tested my bike I nearly drove it into a wall. Our guide, Mike, was more than understanding and got me a much smaller and lighter bike I was able to manage and we were off. This was a fabulous tour. Mike is knowledgeable, personable and very helpful throughout the tour. Some of the highlights were a stop at Petrin Hill Park area, saw the changing of the guard at Prague Castle and even stopped at a beer garden for a quick beer. I would highly recommend this tour for anyone spending more than a few hours in Prague. A great morning or afternoon activity \u2013 well worth the investment."

Mike our tour guide was personable,engaging patient(as we adjusted to the electric bikes) and quite knowledgeable about the history of Prague. He shared stories as we rode and showed us the beauty of Prague including areas where most people live. I would highly recommend this excursion to anyone seeking a less traditional way to experience Prague. And the electric bikes makes it possible for anyone to partake in this adventure. Enjoy!"

We're 3 friends spending a short weekend in Prague and we were looking for an original way to soak up the atmosphere and see some of the sights when we came across I Like Ebike. Thomas, our fabulous guide, took the challenge and even the person least comfortable with cycling in our little group quickly got into it and no matter how steep the slope, it was easy :-) We enjoyed incredible views along the way, stopped for a bit in the monastery and the Beer Garden and loved the sunset ride along the river. Thomas was very knowledgeable and happily shared what he knew with us in a fun way. I'm in Budapest in a few months where they offer a similar experience and intend to do the bike ride there too. Would definitely recommend!"

It turned out to be the correct decision!! I spent 5 hours with Tomas, my guide. He did a really great job. As a local, he knows the city very well and he showed me also parts of the city which are not typical tourist cynosures. Tomas always was careful during the tour and there never was a dangerous situation. He's a good guy! We went for lunch to a typical czech restaurant, the food was so good. The tour was about 30 km, but no worries, everybody can do this! The quite strong motor makes it very easy to cycle, even up to high hills. So it's really no hard work :-) So in my opinion, this is a must for everybody who wants to see Prague without having the classical walking city tour. Book it!!"

The ebikes are easy to operate and despite the traffic, never once felt nervous or scared. We took multiple tours in Prague, Munich and Budapest and this was certainly in the top two. The concept of this tour is simply that you can cover a lot of ground and see multiple sites while listening to an interesting narrative from knowledgeable guides. Highly recommend!"

Prague is very hilly and we wanted to see the city so we decided to go on an ebike tour. We signed up for the morning tour which is 5 hours. I thought it sounded so long but we could've stayed longer! Mike, our tour guide, was a pleasure to be with. We went to the castle, through the parks, down the river, across the river, through a czech town where we stopped for lunch. and that is just of the few places that we went. We saw more of Prague in 5 hours that gave us a rel appreciation for the city and the people that live there. This is a MUST DO tour in Prague! Thank you Mike."

The e bikes are definite way to go in prague with all the hills and cobble roads, to cover the most ground and see the most sights in a short time (I've done segway tours and push bike tours in other cities). The group was small, only two other people, nearly felt like a private tour. The route was a good mix of the key tourist sights and some great local areas like parks, art/graffiti areas that you would not normally find following a tourist map. I found this guys based on their trip advisor ratings, and happy to confirm they run a great tour operation."

The I Like EBike people made certain to contact us a few days prior to give us information on the predicted weather, a map to their location, and personal information about our guide. The office was easy to find on the castle side of the river and was only a short walk from a tram stop. The bikes were a little scary at first, especially when going down the steep hills of Prague at full speed. Going up those hills on the electric bikes is a breeze, though. Helmets are provided. There were only four in our group on the day of our ride. Our guide was so enthusiastic about the city that the tour ended up being extended by an hour, for a total of 6 hours, as he gave thoughtful answers to every question, no matter how silly. Even at 6 hours, the time flew by. Based on our interests, he gave us tips on what we might like to visit in our remaining time in Prague. Our 6 hour tour was time well spent."

I am SO glad that I discovered this tour company. I took the tour back then and knew that it would not be the last time for me. I was blessed to return to Prague last week, this time with my husband, to celebrate our 25th Anniversary. I Like EBike was on my \"MUST DO\" list once again, and was one of my primary reasons for returning to Prague. My experience was top-notch both times. When folks decide on which tour service to use, there are two crucial elements that should be considered, Tour Content and Tour Guide. The following is my reflection on both:TOUR CONTENT: No doubt, Prague is the most beautiful city in the world! However, it is perched in the hilly areas of the Czech Republic, so a traditional bike tour or walking tour could be challenging. Using the EBike, which is suitable for those who are both athletic, and not so athletic, we were able to cover many major sights, including Petrin Hill, Lennon Wall, Sparta Stadium, Strahov Monastery, Prague Castle, St. Nicolas Church, and Metronome, just to name a few! The pace of the tour is set in accordance with the tour participants and stops are given for snacks and coffee! Jan stopped to take several photos of us, even without us asking. TOUR GUIDE: I am sincere when I say that you could not find a better person to guide your group through the city. Jan and his team are not only incredibly knowledgeable about the history and the sights you are viewing, but they are truly kind people. The personality of the tour guide can make or break the experience of the tour. You will not be disappointed in this regard with I Like EBike. Jan is a wonderful human being who works hard to take good care of his guests. He takes his business personally, and operates with the highest of professionalism. He even thinks of the smallest details, such as providing gloves on chilly days. Customer satisfaction is his goal! When you visit Prague, don't miss out on this opportunity!"

Prague has many hills with great views, and an E-bike makes the trip so easy that you don't break a sweat. Our 5-hour tour took us around the entire city, from the castle to parks to an old monastery (beer! goulash!) to the old town area. If you are in town for just a couple of days or for a longer trip, there is no better way to see a wide swath of the city as taking this tour!"

I was still nursing a sprained ankle so this bike tour was a nice break from all the walking on cobblestone streets. The day was a little gloomy but everything else about the tour was great! I've never been on an electric bike but found it super easy to adjust and so much fun easily speeding up hills! I sort of wish my bike had home had an electric motor. I did the 5 hour View Points tour of Prague. This is one of the best ways to see all of Prague from the various hills in Prague. Karel was our tour guide and we had a small group so we were able to ask many questions. He grew up in Prague so we got some personal insight into the city from a true local's perspective. In addition, he was very knowledgeable about the history of Prague and just an all around fun tour guide! Most of the tour was on bike paths and through parks with just minimal time on city streets. There are a few places on the tour through city streets and crowded town squares but it added to the entire experience of biking in quaint Euroean city.I highly recommend this tour!"

He spoke very good English and took us on a tour of the southwestern parts of the city centre and beyond. We must have covered some 20 miles or more and yet the e-bikes made it so easy. Anyone with a reasonable basic level of fitness could do this and find it enjoyable. It really was a highlight of our 6-day visit to Prague and it showed us something of the \"real\" city rather than just the touristy bits. We saw some of the older Communist developments, a counterpoint to the rich and lavish architecture of the city centre and a taste of how the majority of Czech citizens live. If you're in Prague for a long or short stay, we would recommend a trip with I Like E-bike."

We ended up being the only booking for the evening ride around Prague, and with four of us travelling as a family it was a very personalised experience. We chose the night ride as it was ridden predominantly through parks and a few of us hadn't ridden bikes in years. The bikes themselves were absolutely fantastic to ride after the 5 or so minutes of getting used to how they operate, and those of us that were slightly larger in the rear and who hadn't ridden bikes in years even found them comfortable for the 3.5 hours it took to complete the tour. Hills were a breeze! It was great to see Prague by twilight, especially some of the views over the city. The most memorable part was at one of the lookout stops, we pulled up and fireworks started going off over the city, it was so perfectly synchronised it was like it had been planned that way. Everyone we told about the e-bike tour wished they could have come along, and we gave glowing recommendations for a well operated and professional business. It was the highlight of our time in Prague. Thanks again!"

They were excellent, brand new Pedego Comfort Cruisers - really nice bikes and I can't imagine doing the hills in and around Prague without them especially as it was about 95 degrees the day we did the tour. Second, Kate, our guide. We loved riding with Kate. She is Czech so she is showing and telling us about her country unlike some other tours that use American or British guides. She spoke beautiful English. She was knowledgeable and funny and a pleasure to be with for five hours.The Real Prague tour is really great and gives the visitor a nice counterpoint to the historic center of Prague.

Honestly, this tour is worth ever single penny and it NOT to be missed. Skip the segways and get an ebike. Thank you so much. Thoroughly enjoyed our halfway pint at one of the beer gardens <3"

We went to some beautiful points with attractive views of the city. We completed a tour of 35k in five hours and it was super! Kate was always willing to answer our questions and took a genuine interest in learning about the countries that we were all from and comparing them to life in Prague. She also recommended the paddle boats for the following day which we thoroughly enjoyed. Thanks for a great day!"

This was the most stressful part, helmets, kids trying on bikes, filling out a form. Do not panic, just start peddling, turn on your electronic device, and you'll notice that there is a delightful throttle on the handle which adds power as if your bike is magic. My youngest struggled with the hand brakes on the first hill, but soon we rode smoothly. There were frequent stops and our trusty guide Karel (Charles in English) briefed us on history, politics, social issues, economics, happy to offer a lecture or go with the flow of our questions. Five hours might seem like a long time, but these bikes do not require much effort and I never broke a sweat. The views were stunning and we went on such a tangled route through areas I would never have known about, that I highly encourage a guided tour. It was as if Karel magically cleared the path for our single line of motley cyclists. If anyone needed bathroom/food breaks, he easily worked them in. He even stayed out with our group later than the designated finish time to ensure a few extra breaks just so we didn't feel hurried. My kids thought it was the best part of our stay in Prague. We recommend doing this at the beginning of your trip so you feel like a master of the city! This is a splurge well worth doing."

Much better than a walking tour, I thought. Plus, the e-bike was a great vehicle - especially for the hills around Prague. If you want a little exercise by peddling, you can. If you want the electric motor to do the work, that's fine too! Definitely bring a camera and probably some water. Maybe an extra layer or two to stay warm. You probably need to have at least some level of fitness and proficiency with a bike. I probably wouldn't bring small children.

I am an avid cyclist, so this was fun to try out (and almost necessary on the hills as the bikes are on the heavy side). A little practice and you're off to explore all the major sites in Prague. From each vantage point you get a great sense of the layout of the city and how/what you want to see in more detail. The views are spectacular. The pace is set by the group and there are two rest stops (at the monastery for a taste of beer that the monks brew; and later at a park for a quick snack).

We found the office easily from the instructions and met Jan and our guide Kate there where we spent a few minutes getting used to the e bikes. They take a bit of getting used to but they work really well and make all the hills pretty effortless. Kate was really friendly and knowledgeable and it was fun to spend time with someone who was passionate and proud of her city and keen to help you enjoy it. The tour took about 5 and a half hours and covered 35 km but this really wasn't too strenuous and we say areas and places we probably wouldn't have visited if we hadn't done this tour. We did revisit a number of the places again on foot and by tram etc especially as some of the views are stunning. We would thoroughly recommend this tour company if you want friendly and helpful service and an enjoyable way to see a fair bit if Prague in a relatively short time frame at a reasonable cost.

E bike really does not tire you, and you really do not need to be an expert rider. It was a great experience."

This tour was incredible, we did the 'purple' tour which took us and another family outside of the main tourist areas of the city, and into the lesser seen, but just as interesting and beautiful parts of Prague. Peter our guide was great, really friendly and had lots of interesting things to point out as we rode around on the assisted bikes."

I learned a ton about the city, everything from the history of the first castle in the city to the Lennon Wall next to the French Embassy, and the baby statues with bar code faces in the park. I recommend this very, very highly, and have to say that Jan is one of the best tour guides I've used in Europe. I went on a Segway tour in Prague also, and it doesn't even begin to compare to this ebike tour. I wish I would have done this tour first, then done another tour with Jan instead.The ebikes are great - easy to use, and not strenuous, once you get the hang of it (after just a couple minutes of cycling)."

Jan was our guide and he took us on a 20+ mile whirlwind tour of the city to areas of town no tourist would dare venturing on their own.Along the way we stopped at several beautiful parks and Jan's knowledge of the city made it particularly more interesting. The bikes are easy to operate but be warned that your bum will likely hurt by the end of the 5 hour tour. The cobblestone streets take their toll! I recommend you use some sunscreen too. On our trip we had overcast skies and I still managed to get a little burned.The tour was the highlight of the trip but it's definitely not for everyone. For those wanting a more general tour, perhaps a 3 hour tour would be better suited. Jan was outstanding and he made the tour extremely fun."

While we didn't go to the zoo, we did saw some nice wines and stumbled upon the Trojsk\u00fd Z\u00e1mek palace. We followed the river's bank all the way back to Old-town riding nice cycling paths.There was a short time where we had to share the roads \u2013\u00a0mostly in the old part of the city. Otherwise, we were in parks and bike paths, safe from traffic. Anyway, the drivers in Prague are very cyclist friendly.We were with our 1 year old daughter. They provided us with a free infant see and a helmet for her. We decided to rent just the bikes as we are the autonomous tourists-type. In retrospect though, we should have considered a guide: the staff is very friendly and it would have been a great occasion to spend time with the locals :)I really recommend getting an electric bike as some parts of Prague are quite hilly.We liked the experience so much that we did it again in Budapest (same company)! :)"

In 5 hours we visited the most important places in Prague. I highly recommend this tour if you have children. We have two boys (10 years and 14 years old) and they had a blast. The best way to know Prague is definitely by ebikes. Thank you very much for a wonderful and unforgetable day. Ponce Family"

First, Prague is an amazing city but the tourist areas are not made for biking. The crowds and traffic will eat you alive! We did the 5 hour view point tour on 8/13/2014 and had a great time in spite of a few sprinkles. Janna was our guide and did a great job. We stopped frequently and she explained the scenery and points along the 35 km route. We even got to grab a St, Norbert beer, brewed at the local monastery atop one of the mountains above Prague. Get the amber!  The route takes you around the outer parts of the city near the castle, tv tower and soccer stadium but gives you view points you won't see in the teaming masses in old town. The price was 1475CZK which is $70.8 per person. It's not cheap but in comparison to most European cities, this event has great value."

We opted for this tour because we were tired of walking around the city center and main areas of Prague. I have to say, the tour was a complete breath of fresh air. This tour takes you to places that are difficult or nearly impossible to see by foot. Our amazing guide, Jana, showed us so many wonderful things about Prague and educated us quite a bit on the history of the Czech Republic. I'll admit that I was a little hesitant about the ebike but it was SO fun to ride! The ebikes are roughly the same size and weight as a regular bike. After pedaling for a few rotations the motor kicks in and you're off!"

It was really neat hearing about the city from a local. She was super friendly and fun to spend 5 hours with. She even arranged the tour we wanted at a special time due to the weather forcast to make sure that we would have the best time.

It was hot when we went and I never broke a sweat while riding. It's just like biking, no special skills required. We are a very curious couple and the content of the tour was full of the exact kind of educated insider information we crave. It's just as if we called up a distant cousin in Prague and he said, \"Let me show you around.\" Our guide had a personal story about every one of the oddball sites we visited. He grew up here and Prague is his city, but through the tour he made Prague my city, too. Tips:They have water for you to bring along, but I appreciated the extra water I had with me.Send an email to make a reservation. They are very quick with responses and even recommended which day would be the best for the route we chose. Saturday morning was awesome! There was little traffic and the farmers market was in full swing. The scenic tram #22 gets you close to their office. I liked that we did this tour the day after we toured the touristy parts of Prague. It gave me added perspective. (The touristy parts are easy to do on your own or with a free audio podcast walking tour.)The quirky sites of the Real Prague Tour you could never find on your own. Or appreciated them if you did."

They showed great passion in the business. We spent about 5- 6 hours together and we made great friendship at the end. Jan is very proactive. He provided many information and reminder ahead of time. He also emailed us pictures and summary of the tour at the end of day. He obvious loves what he is doing and would love to excel in this business.The Real Prague tour is a great way to see Prague. We got to know the people there, what they think and what kind of life they live in: we visited the stadium, the student dorm, artist resident, a park near the Castle, a geocaching location, a pond with injured swans, a great local restaurant with cheap price-- much cheaper than the tourist area, a beach next to the river, local's shopping area.....many many things. I am impressed how many things we covered in a few hours. A very good way to put yourself in the local culture. Ebike is nice way to cover bigger area and easy to go uphills. You wouldn't be able to cover as much using Segway. Both guides are local with abroad experience. The communication was great and they provided a lot of their perspective, which we really appreciated. One tip of this tour is: you will ride bikes outdoor. So you are better off check the weather forecast, bring sunblock, and wear comfortable clothes and shoes. The rest? Just take it easy and enjoy your time in Prague.Both my wife and I would love to go back to Prague. We will visit Jan and Terezka again as old friends."

We got great background from Jan on various political/social highlights on Prague (why do the doors have symbols over them?), and loved the insights as a way to get to know the city and the people.Bonus: get a couple of the delicious hot dogs if Jan takes you to a biergarten with great views overlooking the city."

She freely shared historical anecdotes from her own experiences and those of her family, giving us unique insight into what it meant to live under communist rule, and then through a revolution and cultural rejuvenation. We rode through scenic parks, had lunch at a working class pub in a small village, viewed and learned about communist-built housing where a majority of the population still live, cycled through the wealthy housing district and even bought fresh vegetables at an open air market in the communist housing blocks. The electric bikes made for effortless traveling, even on the steepest of hills!. I can't say enough about our wonderful experience with \"I Like Ebikes\" and our memorable guide Tereza.

Our guide, Barbora, provided great insight into what life is like in Prague now and how it has changed since the Revolution. I was a slow rider, and she was patient and encouraging.

Both of our tour guides (Bara and Tereza) were informative, friendly and had a very good knowledge of the history of Prague. The tour took us to through the Royal Gardens which offered breathtaking views of the entire city. We continued along the river and to the most beautiful architecture of any city we have visited.

The 5 hour \"Real Prague\" tour was full of sites we would never have seen otherwise. We saw the beautiful parks and a fabulous view of the city. We saw where the \"real\" people live away from the historic city centre. We also travelled through Prague's \"Hollywood Hills\" of beautiful mansions and through the graffiti covered back trails. We had a typical lunch in a delightful Prague suburb. We were very impressed by the tour, the information we received and the bikes that took us effortlessly up the steep streets! It was cool and Jan thoughtfully provided gloves. We highly recommend this tour. It was a lot of fun!"

Our guide was very sweet and lovely!Some Pros: - You get to see a lot of Prague - Excellent if you're in Prague for a day or two- Nice to see life outside of the old town square- VERY easy to get around - no strength required to cycle up the hills Some Cons:- The tour was very long, even for hardened nosy explorers like us we got a bit tired of cycling and had to stop for a drink/chocolate break. Some parts could have been cut out but we enjoy cycling and this was a comfortable way to see Prague -My partners bike brakes were quite squeeky but nothing that a few downhills didn't sort out- We would have liked to get more background information from the guide in certain places but overall were quite happy and would recommend the company to others."

I must say that we were not disappointed AT ALL! Our tour guide, Jana, was just awesome! Not only she was nice and cheerful but also she told us lots of interesting stuff about the history, monuments and secrets of Prague. We had a little stop in this cool monastery where the monks brew their own beer which was really tasty, by the way. We were told that we had done 30km which we just could not believe! The bikes are so easy to go uphill, and especially, they are great fun. In five hours we had done what we would have never been able to do in like 3 days.

To rent a bikes was best choice what we could done!!!! 1st save so much time and most save ur feet!! After day of walking I hated to do another day of running thru town. In 4 hours we have seen half of the Prague sighseeing. Riverside is just gorgeus!!! U can bike along both sides of river where u would never explore ur experience by walking. Superb was tour around zoo aswell.And such a easy way to see president palace..3minutes from that place. 2 girls who work in shop had surpisely good english.(cute aswell btw). So in point of view best choice..taxi is overpriced. Metro dont really big fan of it and buses..its a chinatown for foreins."

Although I had already been living in Prague for 6 months, I had friends visting from Canada, what a great way to see the city and learn the history. Jan has great insight and knowledge, you can tell he is passionate about his city and country, plenty of rest stops, and even a stop for a beer along the way. We had to make some last minute changes, and Jan was very accomodating, great service. A few things that might be good to know...bring some water with you, some snacks too, the bikes have a nice basket up front to carry a few items, take a restroom break when the opportunity presents itself, good blend of cobblestone and paved roads, and dont be concerned about safety or cycling ability - the bikes really do all the work. The tour was 5 hours, however think four hours would be just perfect - we tired near the end of the tour. Overall, the price is worth the experience - good value and will do it again when my family visits in the summer. Sandra K"

The next day he sent us the pictures and edited them and they were terrific. It was a really nice gesture and it meant a lot that he was always offering to take pictures of us. My partner and I never get pictures of us together traveling so it was really nice that Jan did this for us.

Most of the locations were along the outskirts of prague with beautiful views and sights. I highly recommend this tour!"

After doing 18 tours in Europe, this was one of my least enjoyable. The most disappointing aspect was the depth of knowledge from the guide. The information was just scratching the surface and the delivery was poor, as if being read straight from Wikipedia. We asked questions to provoke more info but didn't get answers. This opinion was shared by others in the group.The eBikes were fun, but overdue for replacement. We had to wait around for the batteries to be propped with folded up cardboard before we were on our way. Adjustments and fittings were well worn and difficult, delaying the tour beginning and had us returning late. eBikes used by other eBike tours are far more modern.It was a nice tour to see the sights. We clearly didn't have the same guide as the other reviews I have read here."

This was our 10th tour after visiting Paris, Bruges, Amsterdam, and Berlin. Therefore we had a lot to compare to. We were very pleased with how patient and caring our tour guide was. We showed up late due to a mix up in starting points. Nevertheless, Jan generously took to time to give us a 5hr tour. I believe the tour was named the \u201cReal Prague.\u201d This was my third visit to Prague and this tour was the whole 9 yards and then some. We hit up several historical points such as the Castle and Prokops Valley. I never had seen so much of Prague before! Using the electronic bikes was a joyful experience and an engaging way to burn some calories. There were several steep points we would have not been able to make using regular bikes. I would humble say we are in decent shape (we have a daily workout regimen, but not Olympians). If you are looking for a tour of the bridge, clock tower, and other key areas, definitely do a free walking tour. I like ebikes will cover everything else and other beautiful nooks and crannies you would otherwise never see! The tour is not overtly information dense, since you spend so much time traveling around the whole city. I do suggest bringing a snack or just make sure to let your tour guide know beforehand you would like to stop somewhere for a quick bite. Again, they are a generous tour company and will work that into your tour. The next time we are in Prague we know which tour company to enjoy!"

He showed us the city as insider and it was awesome. Henry is still talking about the Pilsner beer Chris suggested to try. Chris told us about wine festival, so the very next day we went to it and had our burchack. Nice experience. In our bike tour we were on the top of the mountain in the Park and in the Strahov Monastery, in the old sports stadium, in the center of the city we saw guard changing ceremony at Prague Castle, we were next to Dancing House, TV Tower. We were all over the city. We had our exercises and enjoy city view. Don't worry about your leg on the next day. Because our bike tour was EBike the next day was absolutely normal: no aces or pains. Now we became an advocate for EBike tour: taking the tour is an experience you won't miss. We didn't try other tour guide, but if you got Chris as a tour guide - you are Lucky one!"

We arrived on the morning of our ride and were greeted by Jan, who was THE nicest person we met whilst in Prague. He gave us our bicycle helmets and a quick tutorial on the bikes. OMG! The bikes are AMAZING!!! I want one at home! I had no trouble with the bike at all, it was surprisingly easy to ride up a hill (something that i would have great difficulty with normally). We had a great tour around the city, stopping off for stories about Prague, city life and various places along the way. We even got to see the darker side of Prague, which made it feel like a more rounded tour. Something we both thought was a good thing. We stopped off for a few photo opportunities along the way, as suggested by Jan. I can honestly say that Jan really helped to bring the city alive for us and this activity was one of our favourite things that we did whilst in Prague, and even over a year later, we still talk about how great it was.

The views were spectacular and the tour lent local flavour to our holiday. We even had a spontaneous apple-picking break mid-ride! Hidden-away areas and secret cafes and pubs were visited, adding to the experience. It is an ideal way to see the city, (allows one to venture through tiny, out of the way paths towards beautiful views) the bikes are a dream to operate, and is suitable for families, friends and couples (anyone who can ride a bike, really!).

Jan is amazing, and his sense of pride as he shows you around his city is admirable. He truly wants you to have an amazing experience. He went above and beyond what any business owner/tour guide does, he even took pictures of us along the way, and emailed them to us.

We certainly enjoyed the tour and would highly recommend it to everyone. When we return we will ertainly take the tour again and ask for Jana."

To my opinion it was the best way to visit the maximum interesting place and monument in Prague and I can say that after our 4 days trip we have been very inspired to start our visit with it. This \"electric\" tour gives us very good things:1) Escape from the crowdy streets 2) Visit the most interesting monuments in and around town (with all good explanation during 5 hours).3) Experiment the electric bike ( we are thinking about buying one each) 4) A good moment with others participants5) Last but not least: digesting the heavy GOULASH. Try it one time (only just not to die ignorant) and eat in a very good Italian restaurant \"Oliva Verde\" or French Restaurant \"La Gare\"And one less:1) the stoned streets so beautiful to see....; We were still shaking one hour after! Could the bikes be fitted with better suspension? I know what Parkinson means now! Jana thank you for guiding us and sharing your knowledge about Prague history . Stoneless, It was wonderful!Pierre and Cathy"

Being in our 60's and never having ridden a electrically assisted bike, I was a little apprehensive -I didn't need to be - it's as easy as riding a bike! Somehow the steeper the hill (and there are a lot of steep hills) the easier it is to pedal. We took the 22 mile viewpoint tour - appropriately named because as you come around a bend - again and again - you're treated to another gorgeous vista. There is no other way to see so much in only 5 hours. Our guide Kristof was awesome, he was so knowledgeable and fun to be with. He scheduled lots of stops for photos and a lovely beer garden stop too. It was a day we'll never forget"

We did the 5 hour, 22 mile (35 km) viewpoint tour. Here is what you need to know- the bike has an electric assist so you can make it up the hills with no problem. But you are still riding a bike and you will still be tired after 5 hours. You should be used to biking. You don't need to be an expert but you are gong to travel on bike paths, pedestrian areas, roads with traffic and crossing paths with trams. You are on and off the bike frequently. I highly recommend seeing Prague this way. So if you are planning in advance and haven't been on a bike in a few years, take a ride one weekend and brush up on your skills.We met up with our tour guide Jana who gave us a quick lesson in the assist features. Our group of 6 Americans then headed off into the city. The tour is arranged well with some short hops then longer bike path sections that helped us get acclimated to the bikes. You see remarkable vistas and reach areas you would never get to any other way. Not only do you see the traditional sights but most of the more interesting sights also (Dancing house, big babies, metronome, peeing statue). Dress comfortably, bring water and a camera, plan for bouncing on the cobblestones. It's a long but comprehensive excursion with one built in rest stop for food and drink. The sore muscles were also a great excuse to get a massage the next day!"

Being a mature couple we had no problems, you get into the rhythm of peddling and the electric motor kicking in, in no time at all. It was great to ride on the bike paths and through some beautiful parks. There is a small amount of negotiating the traffic and cobblestone paths but we felt comfortable with Chris's instructions and guidance. Toilet stops are available along the way and we enjoyed a cold beer about half way through (own cost). We thoroughly enjoyed our 5 hours and would highly recommend."

Janna was our tour guide, and she was simply AMAZING! Sorry if sometimes we were not listening, it's only because we were so taken by your beautiful city! She had so much knowledge with this awesome city, it's history and culture and always had a smart answer to our sometimes mundane and silly questions. Thanks also for being our official photographer.....the pictures turned out GREAT! Will definitely recommend your company to friends and family visiting Prague. I just wish you would add additional safety equipment like helmets. Its could be a jungle out there biking in open streets.... but you have always kept a eyeful on all of us and made the tour safe for all of us. 5 STARS, you deserve to be \"number 1 to do in Prague\" in TripAdvisor"

When it comes to seeing Prague from the best possible perspective, look no further than I Like eBike!!!The three of us booked the I Like eBike Viewpoint tour way ahead of time and Jan and Krystof kept in touch during the days leading up to the tour, answering all our questions, sending maps, weather updates and tour guide bio. We were not in the best shape and actually wondered whether we would be able to stick it out for the whole five hours.The tour started on time. Krystof showed us the bikes and we tried them out. Well, all our fears proved unfounded. The eBikes are AMAZING. All you have to do is pedal as if you were on flat ground and they do all the work. At the slightest slant upwards, it feels like there's an invisible hand pushing you forward, you gain momentum and whoosh past everything, even the awkward, slower segways.Our tour guide, Alex, was helpful, patient and very sweet. The tour was well paced and the five hours flew by. There are several stops along the way and the tour is very well thought out, with all major climbs (not that they matter, anyway!) concentrated in the first hour, making the rest of the tour a total breeze. And it feels great riding the bikes through Prague's beautiful parklands with the amazing views of the city in both the fore and background! The next day we realized how much ground we covered and all the nooks and crannies we were able to see. It would have been impossible to do the same on any other mode of transport!One of the stops was especially great: Krahov Monastery's beer garden. Delicious trapist beer, great ambiance and service!Young or old, if you're going to Prague, do yourself a favor and book yourself a few hours on an eBike!"

Our tour guide Jan was brilliant. IF you only do one thing in Prague, do a bike tour with I like EBike."

We were constantly informed about the history of Prague and taken to places we would have never normally seen. After an effortless 6 hour tour, we were given maps with information on their best spots for food and entertainment. This is definitely a must do in Prague. Thank you."

From the very moment we picked the tour, we were delighted by the kind attention provided to us: the time of departure was arranged to suit our request, Kristof, our guide, showed us how to deal with our electric bikes (a first experience for the not-so-young-anymore 5 of us) and, all the way, proved to be very thoughtful and informative. Enthusiastic as we were, we chose the grand tour (45 km, as we were told) and enjoyed every second of it: the beauty of the city, the interesting comments of our guide, his kindness and willingness to answer our questions about the city, the history of the country, the way it has evolved, etc. I don't know if my tiredness has to do with it but I particularly enjoyed the drink we had towards the end of the day, on a small boat, along the river, on a spot where you can really feel that the heart of the city beats. I can only warmly recommend this tour and hope I can do it again, some time in the future, with my daughters !"

If you want to become fully educated about Prague, visit a museum or hire a private guide. This isn't meant to do that. It's a tour that gives you a glimpse of the everyday Prague. The tour takes you to the tourist laden sites, but it also takes you to the not so obvious places, that you wouldn't see otherwise. The guide is charming, friendly, and looks out for his charges. At the end of the tour he called a taxi for us, and personally spoke with the driver. He advised us that if we were charged over a certain amount to call him. We had no problems. If you want more information than he initially tells you, just ask. He'll be happy to answer or direct you to where you can obtain more information. I am not the most in shape person, and if the bikes had not been electric there is no way on Earth I could have done this tour. I was still sore for a few days afterwards, but felt the fun I had on the tour was totally worth it.I plan on returning to Prague with my husband, and this tour is definitely on our list!"

My favourites being a stunning rose garden at the top of the city, the views of Prague - it really is a pretty city, Prague castle, the padlock bridges and pausing for a taste of Czech beer.I had never been on an electric bike before and have to admit that I was slightly afraid of cycling 35km, especially knowing that some of it would be uphil. However, I was pleasantly surprised at how powerful the bikes were - cycling for 5 hours was not even the slightest bit difficult. I am even tempted to buy an e-bike for at home!I like e bike are great, they are all really friendly and even took photos of me on the tour after I forgot my camera, these were emailed to me later.I would definitely recommend this tour, its an amazing way to see Prague and the perfect start to your visit to the Czech Republic!"

We took the 5 hour view points tour...best money spent in Prague. Admittedly, I am sore today, but a 5 hour bike tour by an out of shape city dweller has to have SOME consequences, lol. There's no way we would have had such a comprehensive viewing of Prague without the help of Jan, our guide (and owner of I like EBike). What an amazing adventure. I could never have done such a thing on a regular bike. (Did he say 37 kilometers??!)The only real downside: cobblestones. But fortunately, Jan has no compunction about riding on the sidewalk (much to the dismay of several pedestrians we \"ran into\".) We went everywhere. We made many stops where Jan explained what we were seeing and its historical/political/cultural significance. With a great sense of humor and a wonderful (and sometime unintentionally amusing) command of English, this Prague native made us feel like this could be a city you would want to live in.And he called a cab to pick us up and take us back to our hotel, insuring that we would not get ripped off by having a \"talk\" with the cabby before we drove off!!

Yet they feel entirely safe - you are always in control. (I wanted to take one home with me).Jan is really helpful too. We mixed up our timing for the tour we originally booked but he very happily made an extra tour just for us the next morning as the scheduled one was pretty full. He was full of personal recommendations based on what interested us.The tour takes you around the edges of the tourist centre of Prague and really gives you a feel for the real city rather than only the well-beaten touristy tracks.

One, my tour guide (Jana) was great, and two, I felt like I got to see a lot the city I wouldn't have been able to otherwise. I had already toured Old Town Square, Wenceslas Square, and the castle before going, and combining that with this tour, I felt like I had pretty much soon all there was to see in Prague before the day was up. A lot of the places Jana took me in Prague I had never even heard of before, so I definitely wouldn't've known to go there on my own. I think that's the great advantage of this tour--it takes you to the little sites. As far as the bike is concerned, it truly does make it a \"no-sweat\" experience, a claim I had been somewhat suspicious of before going. But it was hot the day I took the tour and I had on long sleeves, and I never did actually break a sweat, so the claim is true. The electric bikes were great, and the tour's not really possible without them. Those bikes went up some hills I'm pretty sure I'd have difficulty walking up on my own, much less riding up on my own. I have only one caveat: if you have some sort of medical condition that makes \"jolting\" dangerous, I wouldn't go on this tour. There are a lot of cobblestone streets in Prague, and bike + cobblestones = jolting. It's just something you'll have to deal with occasionally on the tour, but I think the tour is worth it despite it."

Alex was our guide and she was so patient with me - considering I wore the wrong shoes. For visitors, this tour is a great way to spend your day 2. You get to see all that Prague has to offer on wheels - and then decide what you want to explore more for the remainder of the days now that you have had a glimpse of everything. This was the best move, and I highly recommend Ebikes!"

We did the romantic night tour of Prague. This was definitely our favorite thing we have done here. Great way to view the city and get information without having to walk all the way up those steep hills. It was just the tour guide, my husband, and me. The tour guide was so outgoing and very knowledgeable about Prague and its local life and hidden secrets. He was so flexible about where we went and personalized our tour for us. I highly recommend this to anyone looking to get the most fun out of a tour without all the waking. There are different courses you can choose from. Although Prague was flooded during our trip, we were able to work around it and still had an amazing time. It makes a huge difference when your tour guide is so passionate about his job as well as Prague. He even showed us YouTube clips after the tour of the different stories he told us about during our tour. So worth the money! Definitely doing this again next time we visit prague!"

Our tour guide (Jana) was very kind and helped us in any way she could, explaining clearly everywhere she took us to. It is also worth noting that she spoke in absolutely clear and fluent english - a definite plus. She even tried to help me as it had been years since I didn't ride on bike, and was always very patient. She always went at our pace, never trying to push the schedule. The \"electric\" part of the bike really helps to enjoy Prague better, as it lets you go through hills without much effort, but still retaining the sense of cycling. All around, a highlight of the city."

Just a couple days beforehand, we received an email with the weather forecast for the day, with a kind note from Jan. The actual tour was a comprehensive view of Prague. Having come from Prague, Jan, the owner, gave us a very personal perspective amongst all the other notes of history and tradition. The bikes themselves were in good shape, and they had a strong \"lift\", making the more difficult aspects of the tour very easy for us. At lunch we stopped at a traditional place on the outskirts of the city. The food was delicious at a reasonable price. Most importantly, Jan was very aware of giving us signals as we cycled, always looked back to ensure we were there, and constantly checked to ensure our motor was running after lengthy stops. One thing of note for those who are unaware: Motorists are very courteous of cyclists in Prague, something that North Americans are not necessarily used to. Take advantage of it and enjoy! We recommend this tour to anyone who would like to cover a lot of ground in a short period of time, or for those who enjoy being free from the constraints of local transport."

This was a great choice; on this tour I got to see the city as you could in no other way.Down blind alleys and twisting lanes we passed ancient Romanesque basilicas, Gothic turrets up like magicians' hats, brutalist Soviet tower-blocks, fortresses, and Art Nouveau facades. Prague is a mass of extrovert styles knitted together in a glorious and unique cityscape.5 hours later we return to our origination point, butt sore, and cobblestone shaken.

We definitely saw more than we would have ever seen on foot. Our guide, Krystof, was very knowledgeable and super nice! The bikes are great as the motor kicks in just as you need it and especially on the hills. I was worried that 5 hours would be too long but it went by very quickly and we had a good, traditional Czech lunch at a restaurant outside of the city. This was the highlight of our trip! Krystof and Jan also helped us with restaurant recommendations and reservations when we got back which was very helpful!"

We took 5 hour tour which sounded so long but the time flew by. Christoph was ultra knowledgeable - a warm and informed communicator. He was an excellent tour guide and we learned a great deal in a relatively short space of time. My 16 year old son enjoyed this tour too. The electric bikes enable you to circle the whole town in this time and do as little or as much work on the bike as you choose - you can go electric all the way or as I did - turn it off on the flat but either way you come back feeling great and not at all exhausted. Wonderful views to be enjoyed this way and no hard slogs up the hill to the castle! Brilliant company - don't go to the others - they can rip you off!"

The E- bikes motor kicks in when you pedal, and makes journey really fantastic. Doing the Viewpoint tour, it`s easy to get discouraged by the steap hills of Prague, but by E-bike you don`t have to worry about aching feet. So, did I see the most of Prague by E-bike? Absolutely! Our guide Jan was upmost professional and gave us the tour with a big smile on his face. He gave us insight to Pragues history and historical places, and a really good overview of the places to visit. And the viewpoints was spectacular. We even got handed woollen gloves so we shouldn`t freeze.I recommend this over Segway and riding a car -. Gets much more intimate and you can travel the parks with no hassel at all. Did I mention the fantastic guide Jan? Well now I`m sure I did:)Mikael Karlsen"

Ebikes are a great way to get around the hilly parts of Prague & enabled Jan to take us further than an ordinary bike would. Jan clearly knows Prague very well (I think he was born there) and is very enthusiastic in sharing his knowledge. This probably only applies during low season - If the office is closed the first time you try it is worth trying again (maybe better to contact online)."

            "review": "Best Surprise of our Trip!!. We came to Praque with a 1,000 things to do and see, but a bike tour was not one of them. We happened to stumble across the \"I Like Ebike\" shop, as we stopped across the street at a great local pub for a glass of wine, beer, and some people watching. Seeing Jan and team demo the bikes for potential clients got us curious as they were just very friendly, even from afar, and the reaction of clients as they tried the bikes on a hill for the 1st time made us go check it out. Jan even came over and had a beer with us at the pub, after hours of course :).Well, the excitement was justified as the bikes are just so so fun to ride, and effortless on the hills. They really are a great experience, even for novice riders. So, after giving them a try near the office, we signed up for a tour to ride the very next day. We originally wanted to do a city tour, but Jan spoke with our guide, and she really wanted to show us some outdoor/counrty side too (her specialty and favorite ride). So, being easy going, we agreed on some exploring adventure and met Odessa, our tour guide, bright and early the next day. As soon as we met Odessa, we knew we were going to have a great time. She was a vibrant, young lady, very intelligent about local and national cultures, and spoke english very well. She is also a jetset traveler, just returning from a trip afar, and has lived in the US for many years; so we had much in common. She was as excited to ride as we were, which we realized is simply that she loves her job and riding the bikes are just a lot of fun.Our trip started out rolling thru the parks, and cultural areas of the city, with Odessa showing us many interesting and exciting new things we missed before on foot. She knew her way around town and gave us plenty of opportunity to stop, talk, and learn about Prague. Next, we rode our bikes down the canal and out of the city into the countryside where we ended up in a national park. The area was remote, scenic, and beautiful - just a great contrast with the bustle of the city life. We even stopped at an area with a small cave for exploring. Along the way, we stopped at a small town pub for beers and pretzels too - FUN! One of the nicest surprises was when Odessa took us thru the back hills of the countryside, where we were riding our bikes thru orchard fields with the city skyline as a backdrop - a little off road riding. We went thru the fields, around some cherry trees and into the woods, where we ended up at a nice, quaint, zoo with local animals for viewing and feeding. Not something we really expected, but a great adventure nonetheless!All in all, our trip was way more than we ever expected. Everyone at \"I like Ebikes\" was super friendly and personabl and really made us feel good about our trip. If you are going to Prague, there are the essential things you need to see and do - taking a bike tour with \"I like Ebikes\" should now be on that list. FANTASTIC!!Joe KoppSan Francisco, CA"

The e bikes in Prague rated so highly, we just had to give it a go. The viewpoint tour covered lasted 5 hours and covered an amazing 37 km around the parks and scenic highlights of the city. Our guide Jan owns the company and was the perfect host. The electric assist on the bikes was awesome and made the hills easy whilst helping work off that incredible pork knuckle from the night before. Jan welcomed questions and really enjoyed the interaction with the group. We would NEVER have experienced and appreciated as much of what Prague has to offer without this tour.

My family and I (wife and two kids, 9 and 12) selected I Like EBike based on reviews we had read here and we were not disappointed.The Guide: We found Jan to be an excellent host and tour guide during our time spent with him. He went out of his way to make sure that my youngest would be comfortable on a bike on her own. He also also was extremely flexible in finding a time to take us on a tour when the weather was nice. He spoke excellent English and even tried to teach us a little bit of Czech during one of the breaks. He seems to get along with everyone and made sure that we had plenty of opportunity to ask questions while giving us a great deal of information. He also knew a couple of good local snack shops that we stopped at for a quick bite to eat and some warm drinks to keep the kids happy. The equipment: This was our first experience with an electric assist bike and we were a little nervous about how the kids would do and how much work it would be to tackle the hills around Prague. Our fears were unwarranted. The bikes were all in great condition and we had no problem getting up and down the many hills we encountered on our 3+ hour tour. The bikes have adjustable \"boost\" settings and we were able to set them for the varying levels of skill we had. My 9yr old had one setting, the 12yr old had a slightly different one, etc. Helmets were provided and Jan brought along raincoats in the event the weather didn't want to cooperate.The sights: We did the bike tour on our second day in Prague so we had seen a few of the sights Jan took us to but we got a lot more out of them with his 'local' knowledge. We weren't sure which of their preplanned tours to take so Jan came up with a personalized tour just for us. We saw all of the major sights and went through several of the parks surrounding the city. We were able to really expand on what we learned from Hop on/Hop off tour from the day prior which gave us a good overview while Jan filled us in on more of the details and what it meant to live there. If we can work in another visit to Prague we will definitely do another tour with I Like EBike."

During our stay in Prague we were looking for a quick way to get the Castle avoiding pushing the baby buggy along the slope so we contacted Jan to get info about Ebike. The main question was whether they had baby seat for the kid. As the answer was YES, we went to rent two bikes at once for the rest of the day. Not only we got turistic places such as the Castle with no effort at all, but we also were in places recommended by Jan especially done for children. Prague has amazing parks where is difficult to see any turist. An example can be Letn\u00e0 Park, if you travel with kids, dont miss it! Ride to the Prague parks! You can enjoy a beer there while your kids are happy playing not far of your sight. Then come back to the city centre riding along the river. We did not book any tour because we depended on our baby routines. However we will have other opportunities in the future. That is sure because we came back to Spain delighted by the country itself. \u010cesk\u00fd Krumlov is a medieval town in the south you must visit if you have the time. We really enjoy that day in Prague riding the Ebikes."

Jan (owner) sent an email saying the company had an internal meeting booked that day but could accommodate the next day. Due to my work schedule, I was not available the next day and let Jan know. As I was contemplating what to do that day, I received an email from Jan proposing we do a 3 hr (vs the regular 5hr) viewpoint tour from 5-8pm that same day. Well....imagine my surprise....HOW NICE IS THAT!! Talk about customer service....seriously he did not have to come back to Prague at the end of his day to take one person on a 3 hr tour and I told him so in an email. He insisted it was no problem and met me at the office at 5pm. Jan is a very kind, caring, enthusiastic young entrepreneur who could teach businesses about what customer service is all about!!! The bike was easy to ride and a lot of fun....went on a lot of trails,saw the BEST views of Prague AND got an enriching history lesson along the way. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this tour to all as it takes you through some beautiful parks, a lot of the historical sites and is very relaxing and enjoyable. The directions and guidance given by Jan is excellent and the price is a great value. Jan was never rushed and truly seemed to love his work...I predict a lot of success is in store for this young man! Thanks Jan!"

You can cover so much more than on a walking tour, and with the assisted electronic aspect of these bikes, you can physically last a lot longer to see a lot more. The electronically assisted bikes were so fun and worked so well.I got such a kick out of zooming up hills with no effort. In my view, so much better than a bus tour too as you're outside and physically active, and you really can see things better. Importantly, you're not riding in the middle of city traffic but mostly on paths all around and above the city in its parks and surrounding hills, many of which areas we wouldn't likely have seen otherwiseAnd then there was wonderful Kristof, our very knowledgeable and enjoyable guide. He's a history major at university, and his wealth of knowledge about the city and country was amazing. He was so thoughtful and responsive to our interests, needs and questions. Just a really nice, sharp guy.My friend and I agreed that the EBike tour was our favorite part of our trip to Prague."

I have to admit, I was a bit skeptical when my husband recommended that we sign up for this tour because it seemed like it may be too challenging, given the 5 hour duration coupled with the hilly terrain of Prauge; however, I was pleasantly surprised at how fast the time goes by and how easy it is to navigate through the beautiful city via the eBike. Jan, the owner and our guide, provided just the right level of information (without bombarding us with too many facts to absorb) about the highlights of the sites we visited. We took frequent stops for pictures, which were amazing as Jan knows all the best places to stop for 360 degree views of Prague. We even stopped for beer/refreshments along the way, while we enjoyed beautiful views of the city. Jan was pleasant, easy to talk to and a great ambassador for his city.What makes this tour different from the others is that the eBikes make it possible to cover a lot of ground without expending a lot of energy. I am 4.5 months pregnant and I easily navigated through the 5 hour tour, never feeling like I over-exerted myself. The cool thing is that you still need to pedal and balance (like a \"normal\" bike) but the eBike offers assistance when traveling up hills, etc. Much of the tour was on bike paths, which were safe and easy to navigate.Have done bike tours in multiple cities around the world and this was one of the best!

Real Prague is not the Prague of cathedrals and palaces and museums, but about life as is is lived today. It is the living and concrete (much of it crumbling) story of the Czechs' ongoing struggle to rebuild their country following the Soviet occupation. You find also that for the people, engagement in and respect for culture is not just part of their history but of their lives and we saw and could appreciate the humour and creativity everywhere, because our guides showed it to us. It was more like being shown around by friends, swapping observations on each other's lives, intelligent and insightful discussion and a bit of ribbing.

And using Ebikes makes riding the bike up and down very easy.So this tour with \"I Like EBike\" is a MUST for anyone that wants to see Prague off the beaten tracks!"

I was certainly glad to have the motor to help during this 40km ride. You will see Prague from all of it's surrounding high points, without being exhausted. This is a truly beautiful city, and it definitely needs to be seen from these View Points.Jana was a fabulous guide; full of great stories and history.Best of all the half way point is in a beer garden :)"

Our younger son (11 years old) was very hesitant at first but Jana was extremely patient and soon we were all cruising around happily. The bikes are very comfy and even on an extremely hot day allowed us to get an amazing introduction to a beautiful city. Jana was an excellent guide - informative, friendly and very aware of our safety and comfort level. The greatest compliment I can give is that both of our sons were disappointed we couldn't fit in a second tour!"

It was scheduled as a 5 hour ride, visiting many places that were 'off the beaten path'. The tour was excellent. Our guide was born in prague, and was very well informed on the history and customs of the region. She was not only concerned that we enjoyed our tour, but wanted our entire trip to Prague to be wonderful. In addition to all of the information provided on the tour, she provided many suggestions for things to do/see in the days following the excursion.Also, we are not a particularly athletic family, so there was a little concern about being on a bicycle for 5 hours. However, the electrically assisted bikes are wonderful. Although you have to keep peddling for the motor to remain engaged, peddling was somewhat effortless, even going up and down the hills of Prague. Our tour actually lasted 6+ hours, and no-one in our party had any difficulty completing it, including mom/dad (45-50 yrs old).I cannot recommend this tour highly enough. It is a terrific way to see some of the more popular attractions, as well as a few things only known to those native to Prague."

The bikes provide much more power and speed than I imagined, making getting getting around the steep slopes of Prague a joy. The Staff are both friendly and helpful, and the bikes are well maintained and reliable (we had no problems). There is plenty to see within a short distance of the shop, so it is an ideal start point for sight seeing this side of the river. Cycle up the hill to visit the mirror maze and then grab a coffee or an ice-cream, as we did."

This is not fitness biking but it's not so so easy, afterall you still have to pedal the electric bike.Words can not express what a great experience our 5 hour tour was, had we had more time in Prague we'd do another.The owner is a wonderful, adorable, personable individual who really cares about his customers and want to help. Two of the staff we met were just wonderful. Our tour guy was Chris I think, I feel badly I can't recall his name, I have a snapshot of him in my mind. He was a bright, perceptive young man, who was so helpful, kind and thoughtful.Check their online site, I can almost promise you won't regret it.Great for couples, friends, older teens, adults, older adults if they have no balance issues, and families - but again the later would be discussed with the owner, as their are options.Keep in mind, this is different than a Segway tour, which can get into the cobblestone areas, but frankly this was much better, and a great use of our time.Raves from New Jersey, Karl and Lisa"

We took the Real Prague tour with Jana-she was fun, knowledgeable and took us to places I am sure that we would never have seen with a traditional tour (bunkers, beaches, goats, in addition to beautiful monuments, churches, neighborhoods)...we covered close to 50km on the bikes. It was the perfect family outing for our family of six. The riding was not strenuous and we had a phenomenal day. We stopped for lunch at a very traditional spot (about a 1/3 of the cost of lunch in town). It was one of the best meals of our trip. Thanks I Like Ebike Team!"

I was in Prague for a conference with my wife and on our way back from the Prague Castle we stumbled upon Jan's bike shop called i like e bike. It turned out to be the best part of our visit. We booked his real Prague tour we had an amazing 5 plus hour tour of sites we never would have seen on our own. We passed through a public market along the river, saw an old soccer stadium coverted to a multi plex, had a chance to see communist era apartment blocks and shopping centres and had a sense of how bleak life must have been living in that environment, saw the high rent district too, had lunch at a small bar in a quiet neighbourhood and met some of Jan's friends that make flying model aircraft. We saw the beauty of this amazing city from a number of vantage points and the electric bikes made the journey up the hills a breeze. Jan was a wonderful guide and as other reviewers have said it was like being with a good friend learning all about why he loves his home town. We had such a great time we booked another excursion a few days later to Karlstejn. Jan was our guide and we spent a full day together riding 45K to the townsite with stops along the way for beers and water refills (it was a hot one and at one stop we were introduced to the fellow that owned the modest refreshment stand and when he was told we were from Canada he changed the music he had going on his outdoor speakers to Paul Anka of all Canadians to chose, no Rush for this guy!!!) After seeing the castle we had a late lunch before putting the ebikes on a train back to the outskirts of Prague for the ride back in. If you ever go the Prague and want to see the real thing from people who know their Country's history and are happy to share it with you, this is the tour comapny for you. You will not be disappointed!!"

He is super friendly and helpful. I hadnt ridden a bike in ages, but he made sure I was comfortable with it before heading out.We went to all the major sights in Prague, all lit up at night. There were hardly any tourists or cars around, and we were the only couple on the tour, so it felt like all of Prague was open just for us. Jan gave us a wonderful tour and explained the history of the buildings and had lots of interesting information for us. At the end of the tour he took us to the beer gardens for a cold one, and took his time taking us back to the office at the end of the night. Not only did we have an amazing tour, but we felt like we had known Jan for ages, and he was an old friend we had come to visit.

Some of my favourite areas were the parks - which give a slightly less chaotic, relaxed atmosphere and great views of the city.

The best stop was in a park (Letna I think) which had a beer garden under the cover of trees, over looking the city - really great place to chill!

I did 5 hr view point ride. As description says on their web site, I could see the city of Prague 360 degrees. Our guide was Jana. She was sweet and very friendly. It was like private tour so there was only me and my husdand in tour. This was the first time to ride electric bike for me and my husband. You pedal it very slowly then bike pushes you forward without effort. We stopped by at beer garden in Letna Park and had yummy sausage and beerlemonade. If you love taking photos, this is the best way to see the city of Prague. Jana took us to several different spot to take photos of the city which was breath taking. Think that the Charles Bridge is in the middle and you are riding bike around 360 degrees around the city center. You can see the Prague in every differnt angle. The day before this tour, I did Prague Tasting Walk Tour and our Guides, Zuzie & Yan showed us various interesting places on I POD which is usually not included in any walking tours in the Prague. On E Bike tour, we actually saw most of them like Sparta Stadium, World biggest Metronom, Dancing house, Vysehrad , Vitkov, and suicide bridge. We did walking tour, segway tour ( this one was in Budapest), E bike tour and Prague Tasting walk tour. I think you always get what you paid for. Cheap walking tours are hard in hot summer weather. Segway or E bike tours are much nicer with breeze coming while you are riding and also cover many more sights. When we were doing walking tours in Budapest, we were so miserable in hot weather, but Segway was so much better and cooler. If you are in Prague, try the E Bike. You won't regret it."

Since we only had 2 days in Prague, we knew that the ILIKEEBIKES View Point Tour was the way to go! I contacted Jan Pavlica via email and Facebook and the company were very accommodating regarding our schedule. Our hotel was just a few blocks down from the Castle and the EBikes meeting spot was just across the street from our hotel and down a few steps, so just a few blocks away. Prague is stunning but there are cobblestone streets everywhere and many small hills. The Electric bikes were GREAT and made the entire day very easy and very enjoyable. We had never ridden electric bikes before, but they are very easy to get used to \u2013 you must pedal two complete revolutions and then the battery kicks in. Brian was our tour guide and he was just fantastic! My husband and I were the only two on the tour so it really seemed like a private tour. The bikes had baskets so we each had a water bottle, and since it was warm, the three of us stopped and had some fantastic ice cream. Brian was very cheerful, knowledgeable, and a very thorough and friendly tour guide. An extra, added nicety was that a few days later, after we returned to the US, Jan Pavliva sent us an email with all of the photos Brain had taken of us. Also, look at their Facebook site for many more beautiful photos from all of their tours. We had a fantastic day and would definitely recommend I Like EBikes, Jan, and Brian to everyone!"

Wow! What a way to be able to cover a lot more territory. And Prague is the perfect city for it, because there's so much to see and do in areas that are both uphill and spread out. We also were fortunate that it was just my husband and I on the tour. Brian, an American married to a Czech, was our guide. He was so interesting and helpful. It was a great way to see so much more than we would have otherwise."

We were lucky enough to have just my girlfriend and I on the tour and were able to see an enormous amount (35 km ride)of Prague in a somewhat short time (5 hours) and still felt like I could do it again by the end of it.Ebikes are an amazing way to see the city of Prague. The ebikes effortlessly took us to places we would of never gone otherwise - don't be worried about fitness levels as after a couple of pedals the motor kicks in and your on your way, uphills are a breeze. You get such a better experience from seeing Prague via an ebike as you can visit beautiful places without spending time or effort normally required to get there.We were in Prague for 3 days and have already been to some of the main areas so it was fortunate that the tour we went on took us to places that we would of never seen otherwise. We were able to see how the local people of Prague live. Our guide told us stories and showed us places from where he was from, how he grew up and how life is really like in Prague from a Czech perspective. Both my girlfriend and I found it very interesting and found some very cool and cheap local places that we would of never been to otherwise.Our guide was also very friendly, always spoke with a smile and went out of his way for us. Great customer service. I want an ebike when I get home!"

I had accidentally ripped my ankle ligaments two weeks before our trip here, when we spotted this attraction. E-bikes are fab as it requires no effort and allowed us to experiance Prague without me having to limp everywhere we hired the bike for 5 hours and we visited both the new & old town and the nature parks too. Had we not found this gem of an attraction I would have struggled to get around Prague so effortlessly. I would hire again, fit or not on our next visit. The staff were professional, knowledgable and friendly. You can have a guided bike tour too, we decided not to as we have both visted Prague a number of times, maybe next time we will.

You zip up steep cobbled roads and then can cycle down the hills. Great fun and effortless. However, if you want to keep fit, you can adjust the level of electronic assistance down to zero. (We're both carrying a few extra pounds so the help was much appreciated!)Yana was very helpful and gave us lots of interesting info that wasn't in the guide book. It was fascinating to hear about the Strahov stadium, apparently the biggest in the world! There were also some wonderful views of the old city. We also stopped for some Czech \"refreshments\" in a pub that Yana pointed out.We would thoroughly recommend the tour. A great way to spend a day.Mike and Sophie."

It was a nice introduction to Prague and worth the money. Our tour guide, pronounced yana (not sure of spelling), was very friendly and accommodating.You get to a lot of beautiful vantage points which would be much harder to access by foot with all of Prague's hilly streets. The E-Bikes give you a strong push which makes steep hills easy. You also see many sides of Prague and many tourist attractions. The stop at the Letna beer garden in the middle of the tour is also a nice break. However, I have a couple suggestions.The first 2 hours of the tour were perfect with moderate biking and tons of nice stops and views. The last 2 hours, however, were almost non-stop biking with only a couple nice stops. Maybe it's just the layout of Prague that leads to this but if there were any way to spread the tour out more evenly, that would have been nice. Also, if you're not used to biking, 5 hours will probably leave you with a very sore bum.A great tour, but in hindsight, we would have gone for the 2 or 3 hour version."

TripAdvisor recommended the Electric Bike Tours and we decided that early the next morning, that would be the plan.We arrived mid morning and were greeted by Brian from New York, who told us about our options. We immediately signed up for his recommendation (Sights of Prague, I believe) and had a practice run on the bikes. I was very nervous b/c I am not the strongest cyclist, but Brian reassured me that I would be fine.All I can say is that the bikes were a breeze to operate and there was no way that we would have been able to see everything that we did (42 kilometers) on our own and especially with all of those hills. The sights were spectacular and you got to see Prague from so many angles. I couldn't believe how much we covered when we looked at a map!The best part of the tour was being able to see all of these neat things and taking a mental note of what to come a visit the following day for a closer look. Brian was super knowledgable of Prague's history and of the best spots for a good meal at reasonable prices.All in all, the electric bike tour was money well spent and we felt that with 2 full days, we can say that we experienced most of what Prague has to offer"

After custom fitting us to our eBikes, Jan gave us a great overview of how they work and the advantages of seeing over 35 km's of the beautiful Prague picturesque views. We went to the largest soccer stadium in the world where the Spartan's practice and play, then set off through beautiful parks and visited the Monastery for a nice cold beer at St. Norton's. Jan is the best guide and was able to provide spectacular history while blending in some fun anecdote's and personal background. I would highly recommend this activity as you will see the beauty that is Prague from every vantage point.

The electric bikes were fun to ride as the motor kicks in once you start pedaling a bit, you feel a cool breeze in your hair, and it's exhilarating to just ride around and see such beautiful sights in such a fun way . In my opinion it's also the perfect way to tour with a family (teens), because riding a bike is much more fun than walking around the streets, and you are unlikely to hear any complaining. We did not enter any buildings other than a monastary, we just received an overall visual tour of the touristy and not so touristy areas of Prague.

That particular day I was the only one participant, and I was so glad Bryan's wife could join us for a tour. She was a very friendly and charming Czech who shared her insider's view as we rode through different sections of the town. Bryan was super friendly and down to earth guide who made me feel as if my friend was showing me around the town. The tour stopped at a beautiful beer garden with a magnificent view for a glass of excellent beer and sausages, and then to an ice cream shop towards the end of the tour. So, you'll have some moments to rest your bottom here and there. I won't spoil people's future tours by mentioning exactly where I had visited. Their website has videos that show the rough itinerary for the different tours. I felt the value that I got from this tour was excellent. The name of \"View Point Ride\" is not a misnomer!! You will definitely enjoy magnificent views of both old and new portions of Prague from different angles with bits and pieces of interesting episodes. Most of the spots that we had visited weren't in my RS's \"Best of Europe\" guidebook. I am not sure if they were listed in more Prague specific guidebooks from LP or Foder's. The fact was that I mainly saw locals enjoying their day off in the sun in those places. Bryan also took me to a gigantic old stadium that bore the strong atmosphere of communist era which conjured some sort of nostalgic feeling. All in all, I felt that I got to enjoy both \"light and shadow\" of this town that added more depth to my trip to Prague. I also felt that even if those spots were listed in guidebooks, it just won't be possible to cover all I have seen in one day by biking myself. I can't even picture making the ride meaningful and vibrant without someone telling you the episodes that go with what you see. The ride itself was quite easy and safe. I have done different bike tours in Amsterdam, Paris, and Beijin previously, and I felt that this one was by far the most safest since you can ride in pedestrian way. I did this tour on Saturday, and the streets weren't quite busy. However, the ride in the old section of the town gets extremely bumpy with large cobble stones. I would say, about 10% of the tour was bumpy, and rest was super smooth ride. The bikes were pretty new, and comfortable. They have small baskets in front, and you can keep your bottled drinks and raincoats etc. Though it was a mostly sunny day the temperature was about 40 to 50F, and I was glad that I had a long down jacket and a scarf. I highly recommend this tour for solo travelers and groups alike. After taking this tour, I felt sorry for the tourists in the super-crowded touristy areas of Prague for missing what I had just seen. The money you spend on this tour will totally worth it. I hope this helps."

My husband and I (late 20s / early30s) spent three hours on a guided tour of Prague (5 hours total) on a chilly, drizzly, overcast day in early April and it was still one of the best activities during our trip through Europe. Jan, our guide, clearly loves his hometown and showed us some of the best sites as well as some amazing lookout points we would have missed on our own. After all that and sharing a beer in the beer garden we headed back to Charles Bridge, got some helpful tips and recommended sights to check out and were happily on our own for two more hours that went by way too fast! Jan was an exceptional and knowledgeable host, going far above simply being a tour guide, it felt like we spent the afternoon hanging out with a friend. He took some beautiful photos of us and even recommended a lively local restaurant around the corner from the office where we chowed down on a giant pork knuckle and cold Czech beer (yum!) after returning the eBikes. This was a unbelievable experience with a great new company! The bikes were easy to use and a lot of fun, customer service was fantastic (they took us out immediately when we showed up unannounced on their doorstep hours early because the weather forecast for our initial booking time looked miserable) - and the price was great! If you can afford to do more than three hours on with the bikes you won't regret it, stop thinking about taking this tour and send them an email to set up a trip right now!Good luck to eBikes as they grow, we look forward to another trip with you the next time we cross the Atlantic and make it back to your beautiful city! Thank you Jan and I l Like eBike for turning a grey day into an unforgettable one!"

What can I say? This was a phenomenal experience, the fondest memories of my trip to Prague are with I like EBikes! Jan did an excellent job of hosting my friend and I. He accepted our late request for a tour and made sure we had the best experience possible. He insured that we were comfortable & safe the entire trip, stopping to buy us hot chocolate, and asking us our particular interests so that he could customize the trip. Jan as a person is 100% professional, and genuinely friendly! He is a wealth of knowledge about the town's history and attractions. He excels in customer service like none other I have met in many years. The bike fleet is in top condition and riding them is a dream. Anyone can ride these bikes, as they assist you electronically up hills. It is simply AMAZING!! I can hardly wait to return and bring more folks back just for this experience in Prague. Prague is a great town to walk, but to get to the outskirts, where the beautiful parks are on top of the hills, I LIKE EBIKE is the ONLY way to go!!! Much better than any other tour offered!!"

Thomas was patient and overly kind as we made our way up hills and through the cobblestone streets of Lesser Town, Castle Hill, Letna, all the way to and across Nuselsky Bridge, and back to Old Town constantly keeping us entertained with nuggets of history. We took short breaks-one even for sausage and beer--and thoroughly enjoyed the 5 hour trip. We never would have guessed that Thomas had only just started with ebike that week--he was a real pro! Next time in Prague we will most certainly try one of the other tours. Thanks, Jan for the excellent restaurant tip, too!"

In Prague, it would have been impossible to find the best biking tracks without the guides. Without the engine of the bike, most tracks would have been unaccessible, there are a lot of very steep hills in that city. We took the viewpoint tour, and I really liked the mixture of sights. I have been to Prague two times before, and thanks to this site, I got to see something very different than I had before. The tour itself was perfect, our guides was wery nice and helpful. The sights we visited were just great. They could improve the guiding on this tour with some visual aids.If you take this trip during spring/autumn, bring some gloves and an extra sweather.

Clear hand signals and consistency is key when you're zigzagging through the busy streets and sidewalks.*Slow down on certain busy parts of town.

Jan provided good information and explain some of the contrasts and changes since communism ended there. While we saw so many wonderful sights, and views fit for postcards...it never felt rushed. When we wanted to stay somewhere a little longer, we did. We even had a little lunch during the ride and just enjoyed the surroundings. Even if I only had 1 day in Prague, I would absolutely make sure this tour is on your list of things to do. You will see more and do it in a fun way! The bikes are so fun!

It easy to be found: USA Embassy is marked on every touristic map of Prague, and EBike office is just up the street from there.EBike is very similar to normal city bike, but you have an \"electrical assistant\" which is turned on basically whenever you want. You can adjust the level of the \"assistance\". The battery was full enough for 5 hours of the ride (we rented the bikes for a half of the day). We thought that it would have been a good way to see more of Prague - but we had so much fun just riding the bikes so we actually didn't look so much (at least as much as we thought we would)! There are bike paths along almost all the streets and it is very safe for the ride. You can also ride the bikes along the river, you can \"tour\" the small river island - we found all that very interesting. There are also nice big parks in Prague, where you can have a pleasure ride.For the first-time Prague visitors, I would recommend first to take some walking tours, especially in the historical center. But, to see everything else - EBike is really perfect way. You don't need to be in very good shape - the \"assistant\" is there to help. Sport clothes is not an obligation, but it is more convenient to be dressed in that way, of course. You can put the basket for the EBike - so the small bags, rucksacks are not the problem.I would recommend a half-day EBike ride - maybe because I like the walks as well! The young man who was working in the office is very nice and helpful - he himself took one bike and guided us to the place where we wanted to start our bike tour (not to loose much time in busy city streets)."

Reviews were very positive and we enjoy bike riding so we thought we would give it a go. I booked online and received a telephone call to advise a change of time (only if it suited us) which it did. We booked a 2 hour bike ride which was termed for \"seniors\" while my friend and I do not quite qualify as seniors (45 & 55yrs) we felt this was the most appropriate ride for us. The other rides were all of 5 hours duration which we felt were a bit long for our limited time. Upon arrival we were able to do a test ride to get used to the bikes and then as there were only the two of us a tour was designed on what we had/hadn't seen in Prague inner area. My girlfriend and I thoroughly enjoyed our experience. Excellent commentary was provided by Stephan our guide - a very well educated young Czech with excellent English and with qualifications in history and politics (so he really knows what he's talking about) We were just blown away by the experience it was fun, informative, and provided breath taking views of the city. Basically it was the highlight of our trip to Prague. Although the bikes provided are electric, you are still required to constantly peddle for the electric assist to kick in. We are both quite fit but I would suggest to those who think no effort is required you had better look for a bus tour of Prague instead."

I recommend this activity in city of Prague, in short time you can see a lot and you spend your time actively."

            "review": "Great price, great experience, great people. Hi everyone, My wife and I went to Prague last week and reserved two bikes for the 5 hour tour called \"View Point Ride\". The website was really easy to use and we received a confirmation email the next morning with all the details we needed. We arrived and signed some simple paperwork and paid the fee...which in my opinion, for 5 hours of tour with a guide, was a steal. They instructed us on how to use the bikes and off we went. On this tour, it was my wife and I and the guide, Sara. If you haven't been to Prague, you will find that when you arrive it is very hilly. This is where the genius of the bikes come into their own. There is NO way that you could do this tour on a regular bike, your legs would be killing you. The electric motor is very helpful in assisting you while riding and the settings can be adjusted so if you feel like getting more exercise, you can always turn down the assist. The tour was 5 hours long and after 3 hours or so, our guide changed the plan for the next two hours so we could visit some of the things we wanted to but weren't on the original route. Sara was very friendly and made for great conversation not just about Prague, but about history, culture and the language of Czech. A quick side note...my wife and I rented Segway's in Berlin and had a blast. But, I don't think that they would have been as nice here. The streets are smaller and more crowded and I think many people have more respect for the bike and clear the way than for the Segways. Bottom line, if you are mildly interested in the idea, find out which route seems best for you and book it."

At first we weren't sure whether to rent regular bikes or electric powered ones, but after about 2 minutes of riding we realized it would've been impossible without the motorized assistance. Had a great trip and our guide was awesome!"

We went to places that would have been hard to reach by car. Stephan, our guide was informative, well spoken and very patient with us two out-of-shape 50-something-year-olds. The only negative was riding the bike over cobblestones - very rough on the backside. Overall, it was a highlight of our trip to Prague."

The guys at the hire shop were so friendly and really made sure we knew how to use the bikes and the route we were going to take. All the equipment was new and in good working order.We really enjoyed our day out on the bikes and it was lovely to see some of the 'real' Prague instead of just the tourist sites (beer got a lot cheaper out of the city centre too)The bikes were such a good idea, Having the motor made riding the bike so easy, even massive hills were no problem.If we go back to Prague we will do this again and try one of the other cycle routes."

Prague is HUGE and for two days we unsuccessfully walked around the city, not knowing what to do or what to see, and it took a really long time to get everywhere. On the last day of our stay in Prague, we really wanted to have a unique experience, so we called I Love EBike and they gave us 3 bikes to use for a half day. First, Jan gave us a mini tour of the city for about 1.5 hours then let us go off on our own. While we were with him, he showed us the AC Sparta coliseum, took us to different parts of Communist era Prague, the castle, and then took us on a look out over the entire city.I would HIGHLY recommend I Love EBike. Thanks Jan and the Crew!"

We hired the bikes for 2 days as a self guided tour. We returned the EBikes to the shop at the end of the day so they could be charged overnight, ready for us for the next day. Jan was very helpful, showing us how to ride the bikes. He took us up to the Stadium to make sure we were comfortable with the bikes before leaving us to do our own thing. Prague is a city that is quite hilly and spread out. As we only had 2 days in Prague I seriously doubt we would have been able to cover everything that we did without the EBikes. I was amazed at how powerful they were, particularly on the hill up to Prague Castle. I Like EBikes are a great way to see Prague and they are lots of fun to ride as well."

Well, do not join them, there is a better way to experience Prague. I discovered the I-Like-EBike brochure in my hotel and booked a tour. The office is located between the US and German embassy, so pretty easy to find. The tours are private, so you can choose any time you like and have you personal guide. You can choose between two type of Ebikes, both pretty comfortable and suited for the city. Do not expect racing or mountain bikes, you do not need those for these tours anyway. Since I have used an Ebike before, it was a very nice experience to sit on a bike and drive up hills without sweating. The tour lasted for 5 hours and app. 40km but was never once exhausting. Since theses tours are personal, we changed the tour a little and drove to the inner city. Jan was a very nice guide and it was more like touring with a local friend with stops for a beer etc. So you get way more information and tips than with these bus or walking tours. So if you want to get a real view of Prague and the weather is nice, I would definitely recommend this tour!"

Having simply stumbled across 'I Like EBike' as we were slowly drudging up the hill to Prague's Castle, we decided to give it a go the next day. As we had been in Prague for 2 days previous; we felt we had seen and explored the city to a good enough extent to glide leisurely around on bikes for a day, retracing our steps from our previous ambles. We were wrong. It is only when you are greeted by the friendly staff and talked through the intricate off-road paths of Prague that you really begin to realise just how much there is to see. We followed our maps to the likes of the Letna Gardens to enjoy a picnic with the breathtaking panoramic views as a backdrop- and further down to the sandy beach style hideaway for a much needed cold drink ! - Having only hired for a half day we had to redraw our route in order to get back after 5 hours was up, but we could've easily carried on for at least another entire day. With the major benefit of having electrical assistance these bikes are a truly ingenious way to travel round and explore the city to it's greatest depths...just look out for angry looks on the face's of other cyclists who don't have the electric assist as you peddle without breaking a sweat to the top of the hill to Prague Castle :-)"

You can see lots of places, to which you normally couldn\u00b4t get to. Avoid the bumpy roads .- it\u00b4s not very pleasant to bike there. We went along the river and into the woods (kinda lost our way there). I would recommend to walk in the first district and around the castle and see the e-bike as a great expansion to experience the not so common parts of the city. The bike goes relatively fast (faster than I expected, up to 25 km/h) - we drove in 3 hours about 12 km (without a great deal of effort)I would definitely do it again (even my often complaining girlfriend liked it ;-). The price was ok, could be cheaper for half a day. Very nice staff. I would not recommend for more than half a day - my tushy was hurting a bit after all (or you can take more stops)"

We went for the \"family tour,\" since we had seen much of Prague by foot the days prior. If anything, please enjoy Prague by foot and then explore on bikes. We found we could relate to the sights much more because of our previous days experience with the city. You must take a camera, sunblock, and your sense of adventure. It's so much fun and we highly recommend the sights you see on the family tour. A must for anyone that wants to truly see Prague for all that it is. And you MUST go with a guide - it makes the experience unforgettable. Thank you Sara and the team at I Like EBIkes Prague!!"
