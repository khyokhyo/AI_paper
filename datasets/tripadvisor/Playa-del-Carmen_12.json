It is about a 30 to 35 minute ride form Playa, at the Quinta, to the dock at Cozumel. It is very inexpensive and a nice service. Somethings the water is rough, so plan your day accordingly. Watch your weather reports. The service is good. The people are friendly. The boats are clean."

We had booked the hotel transfer through Amstar DMC. The transfer included a shuttle to Playa del Carmen followed by the ferry to Cozumel and then a 20 minute taxi to arrive at our destination. We took the 9 pm ferry in the month of October. It was a full moon that night and it was beautiful reflecting on the water. The Barcos Caribe staff took our luggage in a very fast and organized way and supplied claim tickets. The staff members are professional. They are all buttoned up in uniforms. They offer everyone something to drink before sailing. There is a video series that provides safety info. After that there is a funny video series aimed at tourists by EMCEE Oscar. He's always next to a bikini-clad babe and they show you the tourist attractions on the island of Cozumel. ;) It kept us entertained for the 30 minute ferry ride.The only thing that was hard on me was that the water was rough that night and the boat was rocking and reeling. I would have fared better with some dramamine. We took the ferry twice more during our week long stay. The other two times were less rocky during the day. The ferry costs about $8 per person/each way. A bell boy at our resort advised us to purchase one way tickets each ride (instead of round trip) because sometimes the time slot that you want back will be provided by another carrier. He told us they won\u2019t always honor tickets from the other carrier."

Barcos caribe is certainly cheaper than Ultramare and provides the same service, we travelled with both several times. Save yourself some $$. Barcos caribe feels more local, Ultramare a bit shinier and tourist orientated. Both have onboard bars."

We took a trip two days ago over to playa del Carmen to meet a friend for lunch. The way over after showing our plan local cards we were charger 69p for each. On the way back we ran to catch the ferry and I took out the cards to show we were locals along with my credit card and said I'm gonna run to bathroom so just give tickets to my husband. After getting home to Cozumel I saw I was charged 135 for each of us. I went back to the ticket counter and explained .the girl called her mgr and put me on the phone with him. He said I would have to go back to playa and get the other half of the ticket I gave to girl when boarding before he would help . Ok so I have to buy a r/t ticket and then try and find girl who took my ticket and the exact ticket. No way!! So I just said o.k I will call my cr card company and they will fix it. Poor serviceMy credit card company has already given me the credit."

If you can grab the mid deck outside seats in the back, you will have a beautiful view of the water and Playa del Carmen as you leave and Cozumel and you arrive.Go straight to the ticket counter behind the ferry landing and bypass all the guys selling tours. We paid 7 dollars each way."

This turned out to be nice because we had a little extra space in front of us instead of another row of seats right in front of us. The boat was multi-storied and I believe became fully seated before we left. The ride was quick and not rough at all. Coming back was easy. We bought our tickets and waited a few minutes in an outdoor seating area. Had no problems with the services (but Cozymel sucked because it was seemed abandoned and I don't recommend it) but there is at least one other option regarding transportation to and from Playa del Carmen and Cozymel. TIP I saw one dude plug in his iphone to charge in the ceiling above one of the seats. Look at the ceiling for an outlet if you'd like to do this (but people will look at you like you're crazy)."

I cannot express how happy I was when Barcos Caribe started service between Cozumel and Playa del Carmen... their ferries were newer, faster and filled long gaps in the schedule. The other two ferry companies really took advantage of their stranglehold on service. They were slow to cross, taking at least an hour, and expensive - even with a Plan Local discount. Barcos Caribe changed that. They lowered prices for locals and only take 45 minutes to cross! At least the new competition caused the other carriers to speed up, but I'll always choose BC first when I am able."

They gave us a dollar off the rate for adults to ride from Cozumel to Playa del Carmen. Normally the rate is $8 USD one way and kids are $4. I believe that it was one of the cheapest companies. We were told a ferry leaves every 30 minutes by our hotel, but Barcos Caribe looked as if it left every hour the other companies rotated every other hour. We checked our luggage (free) and some of us sat outside on the deck some sat in the air conditioned inside complete with snack bar, and places to charge electric devices. The seats were comfortable no matter where you sat and even though we left the Cozumel dock after the other company we passed them up on the water and arrived basically at the same time if not a little before. This company is fast, easy and a quick way to get back and forth between Playa and Cozumel in less than an hour (about 45 minutes). Overall I would use this company again."

We picked the Barcos Caribe because the time was right and the ferry looked clean. It was and we were pleased with the friendly staff. Be sure to sit on the 2nd level outside to enjoy the trip making it an excursion rather than a transport ride! It was about 20-25 minutes one way and they have a bar on board with reasonable prices."

Inside seating on the second level can best be described as First Class. Lots of elbow room, lots of leg room, a reclining seat and flat screens that provide Island info and some light entertainment. Floor-to-ceiling windows allowed ship watching and taking pictures. You'll wish the ride was longer! And, after a long day of touring on Cozumel, the seating on Barcos was perfect for a nap on the return trip.Ladies in neatly pressed uniforms stood at both ends of the loading gangway greeting us and ensuring our safety. Everyone with Barcos was customer-oriented friendly. Loading and unloading of a boat full of people was well rehearsed and proceeded efficiently.Pricey at $135.00 MXN, but provided a great trip to and from Cozumel."

With Barcos Caribe I never felt like my gear was at risk and it was always respected. With others I have arrived in Cozumel to find my gear both soaking wet and not even on board, but sitting off to the side almost out of sight on the dock."

When you arrive you can get a taxi to take you to local beaches, away from the highly developed main area (which is more costly to eat and drink). We went to Sand Dollar sports about a 45 min walk, 10 min taxi ride (not far the cruise liner berth) to snorkel. Cost US$2 to hire a locker. You can dive here too with instructors."

My guy and I found cheaper prices for Barcos Caribe Ferry in downtown Playa Del Carmen,MX early Christmas Day 12/25/2015. This company and 1 other company offers transportation from Playa Del Carmen,MX to Cozumel Island,MX. The employees and service was good and they spoke some English. The boat ride was approximately 30-45 minutes. You could seat yourself inside which had air conditioning. You could seat yourself outside on 2 decks. Be Warned: 1) Take Motion sickness pills 1 1/2 hr before you board this boat. The waters of the Caribbean Sea were approximately 5 ft high with white caps and it was a rocky ride. If you get Sea sick you may be able to go to the Upper deck. If you want to sit on the Upper deck, you must be there early and get to the front of the line for boarding. I was seated near an Emergency stairwell and an isle and I had to hold on for dear life during the boat ride. They do not provide Ice cubes and do provide beverages in cans and snacks for purchase..2) Restrooms are provided on the ferry, however, the Restrooms were outside on a side of the boat and in rough water you risk falling overboard because the safety railings are too short. My guy said it was a Suicide Mission to try to get to and inside the Restroom and he decided against using it. I was very happy to arrive on Land from the roundtrip on Barcos Caribe. I would travel again aboard the Barcos Caribe."

That leads me into the service...On the 1st trip, a woman was sick and one of the attendants stayed right there with her...helping her, giving her a cold wet cloth, making sure she was OK.

One way for an adult costs 135 MXN and the connection is very good. (the other companies are 165 MXN and 164 MXN one way) I suggest you to occupy the spots on the top floor (however, if you come last minute, those will probably be already occupied) where it is not closed area, it is open air (with some cover so that you do not get sunburtnt) and the breeze from the sea makes it a pleasant experience. To be honest, we found the closed areas of the boat way too cold due to the A/C. The staff will offer you some drinks to purchase during the boat ride (aproximaltely 50 minuetes). I read reviews where customers complained that it is never on time. Well, our departure was scheduled to 9:00, and it actually was at 9:04, 4 minutes, I think can be understood. The same happened on our way back. I would also suggest to just buy one way ticket. By the time you return, you might not want to wait and just pay the higher price for a different company that Barcos Caribe, that goes back earlier."

The discount is only for people with Quintana Roo ID, not all Mexicans. And second, round trip tickets are the exact same price as two one way tickets so i would recommend just getting a one way ticket so you're free to return whenever you please. "

They come around and sell drinks for a good price. The ferry left to Cozumel right on time, but on the way back to PDC the ferry was delayed for about 45 minutes.Other than that the price was a bit cheaper then the other ferry companies."

            "review": "Help on the High Seas. Our group wanted to take a day trip over to Cozumel. This ferry company was the cheapest rt/pp costing $20 each. Overall, the ferry was great. There were options to sit outside or inside, it left on time & arrived on time. My personal problem was sea sickness. We sat up top on the trip over and even though it was only a 30 minute ride, I started feeling ill right as we ported. On the way back I thought sitting in the air conditioned cabin might help me, but 5 minutes before we arrived, I nearly lost it in my seat. I bolted to the back where this lovely ferryboat attendant helped me to the bathroom. Unfortunately, the bathroom wasn't air conditioned so that didn't really help me but I saved all the other riders from my misery. The nice attendant checked on me once and then again when we docked. She helped me back into the cabin area to wait for my family. She stood me under a very cool A/C vent & gave me smelling salts. She was so kind. I wish I remembered her name to say Gracias! I would recommend this ferry boat for the price, timeliness, seating options & the kind staff who helped me when I needed it."

I advise only buy ferry tickets one way, because you might be ready to leave & there is another ferry company (there are 3) leaving sooner than the one youve already bought. It was just coincidental they were the company leaving at both our times. We paid exact $10.00 USD per person each way.It takes about 30 minutes to go across."

            "review": "Clean, comfortable and quick. We travelled to Cozumel on July 25th for a weeks vacation on the island. The Barcos Caribe was the next leaving Playa Del Carmen so we bought our 1 way tickets and waited. The Ferry Terminal is under construction so things were a little disorganized but we managed to find the correct line. Loading was done quickly and they tagged our luggage and gave us an id portion to prove that the bags were ours. The trip over was about 35 minutes with very comfortable seating and bar service if desired. Upon arrival we had to wait for all bags to be loaded from a 4 wheel dolly onto the baggage carousel........waste of 15 minutes since we tried to take them from the dolly ourselves but we're not allowed. Overall a great clean and friendly service that connects Playa Del Carmen to Cozumel. We will hopefully be able to use them when we head back to PDC."

We used Barcos Caribe to get across to Cozumel, the boat was quick and reasonably priced but don't sit at the front of the boat of you get sea sick it can get quite bouncy! Also make sure you grab a timetable as the boats don't come back from Cozumel every hour later in the evening."

            "review": "$10.00 USD OR 135 PESOS - FERRY RIDE TO COZUMEL. Caribe started there business in February They are the least expensive. Buy one way tickets as the 3 different ferries do not accept each others tickets. On our trip only one of their boats was working, so the times were different on their website. They do update info on Facebook but you can call the terminal to make sure the times are correct (987 120 3982 ext 120). They serve snacks and drinks and the trip takes about 35 minutes. We sat on the upper deck and had a great view of the trip. If you are going to rent a car it is cheaper to do so on the island. There is one road that you travel that only goes one way. There is also a highway. Get the info from the rental company before you leave. To get to the beach it is 17 km away and you need transportation to get there. The charge for the other ferries was $12.00USD."

They offer various times to depart and arrive so it works out well. Inside cabin is air conditioned and that was nice. It took about 30 minutes to get across to Cozumel. We sat outside on the way back and watched the sunset. A great value and a great ride."

            "review": "Great Value - Spoiled by serious sea sickness (that was probably just me). We embarked on this ferry ship on our way forth and back from Playa del Carmen to Cozumel. The trip forth was during the daytime and we were sitting on the top section outside. The views at this level were AMAZING! I vividly recommend trying to board early so that you can rush to seat upstairs. Plus, I did not feel much sea sickness at this level (might have also been because my stomach was still empty at this point). The ride lasts about 35-45 minutes.On the way back from Cozumel, we sat in the bottom section. There, there was minimal views of the outside only but the ship had flat screen screens playing popular Youtube videos and short vines. There was also free wifi. It would have been perfect if it was not for the acute sea sickness I experienced. The ship was going so fast that it amplified its constant up and down movements. Moreover, I had just had dinner in Cozumel which I'm sure contributed to my discomfort. This 35 minute-ride felt like an eternity. I was trying hard to keep myself from throwing up the entire time. Eventually, a hostess noticed me and brought me a sickness paper bag as well as some cotton balls dipped in a strong alcohol (smelled liked rum). After smelling it, it lowered my sickness and helped me manage it all the way to the destination. I also felt comforted in the fact that many people around me also grabbed these rum cotton balls (even some who looked like seasoned ferry travelers). Overall, I do recommend Barcos Caribe but beware of sea sickness."
