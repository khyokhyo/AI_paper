The trams are overcrowded and walking (from experience) although manageable, is fairly steep and difficult. Take your time and set aside a full day for a castle visit, you'll need your walking legs on you. The view and the castle itself once you arrive however are spectacular, a must see if you like your castles"

The walk is steep and the cobbled stones are slippery under foot. In hindsight I would suggest taking a tuk tuk right from the harbour side.The entrance fee is \u20ac8.50 for adults and the opening times are 9am - 9pm March - October and 9am - 6pm November - February.There are toilets and a restaurant on site as well as a shop. The views are fantastic and there is an archaeological site dating back to the 7th century to view. A quick hint about the loos - ladies take tissues. There wasn't any toilet paper in any of the loos.There are many viewpoints located on the top of the ridge looking over Lisbon. Beware of the paving in the Castelo as we saw many people falling and stumbling. Two of our group came a cropper."

We enjoyed it nonetheless. The views along the top walls are quite wonderful. Some of the upper walkways will be tough for those with height issues - or are uncomfortable with tight walkways. We took several family photos while standing on the walls that overlook the city - these turned out great. The walk around the castle and grounds is relaxed and should be done at a slow pace because of the uneven cobble. There are restaurants in the castle but we did not use them. The bathrooms are a little hidden; they are free and quite nice. The birds look like peacocks but we were not sure. They hide in the tree next to bathrooms. The Tuk-Tuks will take you up and make sure and negotiate the price. We did not do this, but we took a private tour one day and the guide said to negotiate the price."

The lead up to the castle proper exposed 360 degree views across the whole of Lisbon which is a site to behold. The castle itself is well maintained and allowed further views. To walk requires a degree of fitness and good shoes as the cobblestones can be a bit slippy. There is a good selection of food and drink sellers going up the hill and several within the castle area. All round a good visit. It appears to be a good location to site, read or chill."

We had planned to catch the tram but the queues were too long, so we took a steady walk up various steps and along narrow streets to the top. It was well worth the effort as the panoramic views helped us to get an overview of the city. We enjoyed a coffee on the terrace outside the cafe, a stroll round the castle and a visit to the camera obscura. Finally we enjoyed a visit to the small but interesting exhibition telling the history of the area, with archaeological artefacts. We then enjoyed a stroll back down through the winding streets of Alfama."

You can walk along the parapets all the way around which offers fabulous views of Lisbon. There are peacocks in the grounds near the cafe which were a good tourist attraction. Unfortunately their tail feathers have been cropped. The facilities could do with repairing the lock to the toilet was broken. The museum was small but nice to walk around. It was disappointing that we couldn't access the archeological site as there seemed to be a car park in the way. Altogether a nice attraction and a lovely walk up through the old town to get to the castle."

The castle grounds are beautiful with many breathtaking vistas of the old city. The original Moorish Castle and moat are within these walls and if you climb to the top of the castle towers the views are tremendous. It's also worth some time to explore the narrow streets outside the fortress walls for this is the oldest part of Lisbon. The walk up to the castle gates is demanding but you can take a tram or tuk tuk for a reasonable price."

Today tourists flock to the castle, although obviously not much of the original structure remains. Nevertheless the old walls and fortifications are impressive (and beautifully neat and tidy) and the views of the city and the river fantastic. Added to this it is pure pleasure to stroll through the tiny streets of Alfama to reach the entrance."

In a sunny day, one can easily see the Tagus river southbank, the Tagus bridge, the Cristo-Rei statue, the Pra\u00e7a do Com\u00e9rcio. Once up there, try to close your eyes and imagine the cruzaders camps in the opposite hills waiting for their best chance to conquer the castle as they did in 1147. For a good description about what happened in those days, look for the book Charles Wendell David, De Expugnatione Lyxbonensi: The Conquest of Lisbon edited from the unique Manuscript in Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, with a Translation into English, Nova Iorque, Columbia University Press, 1936."

You can pickup a multi-page booklet in the ticket office. There is a museum of artifacts (neolithic onwards) excavated from the site. You can also visit the excavation.Since I have arthritis, we took the #12 tram up."

The site itself is not huge but you can see away 90mins or so here and be able to take it in while learning about its history. I brought my lunch with me and was able to enjoy the scenic view while making use of the shade on offer and the cooling breeze on a hot day. The structure is well preserved and you can make your way around the site while imaging what it would have been like in its heyday. There are small plaques with information as you make your way around but I feel these could have offered up more detailed information for those that would like it such as myself.

The castle does not hold anything inside, yet the astonishing architecture and amazing view of the city are enough reason to go visit it. If you're traveling with friends, my advice is to take a bottle of wine and enjoy a glass once you get on top. You can still do so, as there is some service there, but it can be pricey. Don't forget your camera but don't plan going there by car unless you have a local friend driving. The streets are very narrow and it's easier to take the tram right next to the underground station. Not advisable for people who can't stand heights or who have to restrict physical effort. It does take some climbing and once you get there, you will need to climb the walls of the castle as well to get the nice view."

Yes, you can get some beautiful pictures with the view to the bridge and Baxia neighbourhood (not sure if the name is correct). The castle itself is pretty simple. Don't get me wrong, it has it historical value, what I am trying to say is, there are not exhibitions with any historical items or any inside rooms you can enter to get the touch of history. There are walls and towers, which once again allow you to get another angle for the view on the city, but that's basically it. Yet I still enjoyed the visit. So you can think before spending money. There are plenty of places in Lisboa with free panoramic views, which also have the view on the above mentioned castle. The choice is yours. I have been there and liked it. However not sure if I can recommend it to everyone."

I cannot imagine any visitor not going there. It is a thoroughly enjoyable experience. The views from the ramparts are magnificent. The gardens are peaceful. The entrance cost is a mere \u20ac8.50 Adults; \u20ac5 Seniors; children under 10 go free. Allow yourself at least two hours to go around it. The Castelo comprises both the ancient castle and the later ruins of the former royal palace. The greatest fun is to climb around on the battlements. The Castelo was built by the Moors in the mid-11th century. After the Moors were driven out of Portugal in 1147 it became the residence of the kings of Portugal, who transformed the Castelo into a royal palace in the 13th century. The Castelo continued to play a major part in Portuguese history over the next three or four centuries. However, its purpose became primarily military when it ceased to be a royal residence, and the King moved, in 1511, to a lavish new palace elsewhere in Lisbon. Much of the Castelo was destroyed in the 1755 earthquake. During the 19th century the military constructed various installations within the walls which eventually hid the entire monument area, obliterating the older ruins. The Castelo\u2019s historical importance was only recognised at the beginning of the 20th century when it was declared a national monument. Major restoration work was carried out in the late 1930s -40 when the newer buildings were demolished in order to reveal the old castle. The Castelo then became a national monument open to the general public. In fairness, much of what we see today is not really authentic but this does not distract from the fact that it does feel genuine.There is a permanent exhibition where visitors can learn about the history of the Castelo and past lifestyles. There is also an archaeological site which shows three significant periods in the history of Lisbon: pre-history (BC); the Moorish era; and the ruins of the last palace residence, which was destroyed in the 1755 earthquake. There is also a camera obscura. Entrance is free and at set times \u2013 every 20 minutes. A system of lenses projects a 360 degree view of the city. All is explained by a guide. There sessions in a number of languages, including English You may have to wait for the English session. Although the castle is terrific, it would be improved by a visitors\u2019 centre with more information, artefacts and hands-on gadgets for the kids. Warning: There is less attention paid to health and safety in Portugal than in the UK. In the UK there would be rails on the battlements.Tip: This is the most popular attraction in Lisbon. Go early to avoid the queues."

Spectacular views of the Tagus River and most of Lisbon. Get there early. The crowds are big by 11:30 in the morning. The grounds are pretty, with peacocks wandering around and multiple gardens but the castle itself is so so. The stair climbs could be too much for some people as the steps are narrow, uneven, and slippery in spots. Navigating in both directions ( up and down the ramparts for example ) is almost impossible for all but the most slim! That being said, the walk to the castle through the old neighborhoods with narrow streets and laundry hanging from the windows, is lovely.

It's worth it even just for the incredible views over Lisbon. It's basically just an old castle you walk all over and look out at Lisbon from. I bought the Lisbon pass before (highly recommend) which included this site. The Lisbon pass will get you discounted tickets to the castle, Sintra and other important sites. Bonus: there are peacocks running around here!"

If that is the case enjoy wandering around at ground level there is still plenty to see.

Use the tourist information outlets for guidance to where these elevators are sited. Pensioners get a reduction in admission price to the castle if they can give proof of age.

This is a marvel of 19th century engineering though this one was installed in 2006. Don't be put off by queue's as it is every 20 mins and 20 people get in at a time. Go even if it's not in your language as it's a visual experience. The archeological tour was fascinating and only 5 people on the 20 minute tour which took us from the house of prehistoric man iron age to the kitchen and garden of the Moors and then to the palace of the first bishop of Portugal all within a matter of metres of each other on the top of this castle. Best free tour in Portugal."

After entering, you discover a large terrace which overlooks Lisbon with near 180 degree views to the West and South. Gazing down at the city below and the red tile rooftops reminds you this was once a bold fortress for the city.The castle itself is interesting. Most of it has been restored, and you can walk through courtyards, and climb stairs to stroll along the walkways atop the inner walls and imagine fending off would be attackers! There are also several rooms in the castle itself that are interesting. One such is a room (all stone) I imagined was a bath house that had a raised platform and 2 squared pits which i guessed were tubs for water. There was also a drainage system above on the 2nd floor, which may have been a rain water catching system.After you tour the castle, the area directly below (Alfama) is an easy downhill stroll, with many shops, bars, restaurants and cobblestone streets.Castelo de Sao Jorge is definitely a must-see in Lisbon!"

Nice trip up through the winding streets. Stunning views inside the grounds. You can see the whole of Lisbon from up there. Some wonderful photo opportunities throughout. Although there were huge crowds, it never felt packed as it is spread over quite a vast area. There is no inside of the castle as such however, it is still a magnificent building. There is an onsite caf\u00e9 however, we didn't try it out. It is worth the few euros entrance fee and you can stay as long as you like in it. We enjoyed our visit"

The site is compact and uses the traditional fortification surrounded by grounds and then a \u2018town\u2019 making this a self-contained and defendable unit.Admission is 8.5 euros and includes the whole site so very reasonable. The town is alive and people live in the shadow of the castle which adds to the experience of a working site. Through the gates you enjoy the outer grounds before heading in deeper to the inner walled castle itself. In the outer areas are refreshments, the permanent museum and pleasant sitting areas with magnificent views over the City. Inside the walls you can explore through archways, ramparts and climb seemingly endless flights of stairs \u2013 but some are uneven and could be slippery when wet so please take care.One thing not to miss is the Camera Obscura. Sited on the tower just inside the walls and using a series of lenses and mirrors you can enjoy a 360 Panorama of Lisbon which is \u2018projected\u2019 onto a screen. Numbers are limited to 20 at a session (you stand around the circular screen) and the showing lasts about 15 minutes. They run showings in Portuguese, English and Spanish at 20 minute intervals so plan your trip to include this. Its real time so bad weather could interfere with visibility so be aware.Overall I found the Castle a highlight of my visit to Lisbon. It offers great views, history back to the 11th Century and a feel of connecting with something special. I fear that the number of steps may put some off but there are still many things to do if that is a problem \u2013 the choice is yours but do take a chance to see something special."

It must be the best in the city. So this remains a must-see Lisbon activity. We went at around 5 o'clock, which was a nice time, but it did mean that the best view was straight towards the sun - not great for photos! Probably best to come earlier or later. Make sure to stop off at the Wine Bar do Castelo on the way back down if you're into wine!"

Busses go to the bottom of the road but it is a long hike up if you have any bronchial or walking difficulties. My advice would be to get there about 9 to 10am otherwise there are massive queues to get in. It is well worth the visit for the view alone, which is absolutely spectacular. There is a restaurant and a cafe and very clean toilet facilities and a little shop. Peacocks walk about the grounds and it is quite interesting with original guns and original features. Worth a visit."

You can walk around on top of the walls though, and take photos. I was told it would take an hour to see the whole thing, but it only took a 1/2 hour. I did enjoy the bus ride up to the castle though. We started spewing black smoke half way and had to switch to another bus. Exciting, right?! :) all locals on the bus. Was entertaining."

That said, I always give accurate and fair reviews and so it's fair to add that I wasn't in the right frame of mind.

Because I think it looks a very beautiful and fascinating place to spend 2-3 hours. There's lots to see and do there, lots to explore, great facilities, wonderful views and all for 6.5 euros (with the Lisboa card).

It does shows every 20 minutes in alternate languages. It is striking how they can use a mirror and a periscope to show you Lisbon in real time.

There are multiple towers all of which you can enter. Beautiful views of Lisbon everywhere. Don't miss the Camera Obscura which is a reflecting telescope reviewing a panoramic view of Lisbon.

Castelo de S\u00e3o Jorge is an open air park, and with a museum and art gallery within it's walls. The park itself is lovely with statues, stone tables & seats, various kiosks serving ice to wine. Worth paying for the panoramic view of the city and to sit watching life below you going on.  The museum is definitely worth visiting, not just to see artefacts and read up on the castle but also on Lisbon too, and it will take several hours if you found it as fascinating as we did.  We gave the religious art a miss, to be honest once you seen 'Jesus' bleeding and looking gloomy by the 5th/6th time on a trip, it's nothing spectacular no matter who painted it.  its not a 5* attraction but its better than a 4*, but if you want amazing views of Lisbon then this is a must visit. Also has a restaurant and wine selling kiosk."

I've been to fortress elsewhere where information is provided and it's very educational, this is not one of those. Go for the views. But you don't need a lot of time to explore.

At the end of our \"free tour\" of the City, which was terrific, we found ourselves a few blocks away from the Castelo de Sao Jorge (the Castle of St. George). So, although we had planned to visit the Castle at sunset, because we were told this was a wonderful time of day to see the panoramic views of the City, we altered our plans and proceeded to visit the Castle in the early afternoon. Actually \"a few blocks away\" turned out to be a rather lengthy trip given the winding, multi-directional roads in the Alfama. Indeed, we wound up taking a tram which let us off a few blocks from the Castle (BTW, the trams are a wonderful way to travel within the City -- however, be careful of pick-pockets.) As we learned, the Castle probably was first built by the Phoenician traders who landed there, later in order by the Romans and Moors, and finally by the Christians -- Afonso Henriques, defeated the Moors taking over the Castle in 1147. There are many exhibits about Afonso and his heroics. The Castle covers a broad area of land on the top of a mountain with steep rugged slopes on all sides. The views in all directions are superb; also as noted, excellent presentations about the history of the Castle, the City and the country. Definitely a worthwhile attraction to visit."

Apart from these walls though, there is very little left of the castle to view.I would though highly recommend visiting Ulysses Tower within the keep to see the periscope, which has a camera which gives a real time 360 degree view of the city. Small groups are let in every 30 minutes, with designated times as to when the talks and viewing are in English.Getting to the castle can be a bit of a hike unless one catches a taxi or tuk tuk to the entrance. We caught the 28 Tram to Portas do Sol, which is below the castle, then walked up a stairway and followed the roads climbing up the hill. It was about an 8 to 10 minute walk to the gates of the Castle from the tram stop. We arrived just after 9.00am which was when it opened and there was hardly anybody around. When we departed about 2 hours later it was fairly crowded. There is a small archaeological museum in one of the buildings and an archaeological site, however the latter was closed when we visited. There is also a cafe and some peacocks which roam around and sit up in the trees.Worth a visit."

For the first time visitor to Lisbon, the best place to see what the City has to offer is from the walls of the Castelo de Sao Jorge which sits atop the highest of the seven hills.To get there one can either take a taxi or - like us - take one of the communal buses from the main Square which at a Cody of Euros1.8 each represents excellent value. This drops you off a short walking distance from the Castelo's main entrance where there was a short queue (perhaps helped by our visit taking place early afternoon). Within 5 minutes we had paid our entry fees (Euros 8.50 per adult with a Euros 5 concessionary rate available for the over 65s).Access is simple and we were quickly enjoying the panoramic views of the City. To be honest there is not a great deal else to see but we did partake of coffee and snacks in the Cafe where I also fed one of the local peacocks for the first time!All in all, a most enjoyable visit and one all visitors to Lisbon should emulate!"

The museum contains many neat artifacts and historical accounts. Walking around the grounds is like taking a step back in time. The entry fee was reasonable and we went late in the day so the line wasn't too long. You will have to walk along uneven, stony streets and pathways to enter and explore the castle, which may not be ideal for some people. There are also many steep stairs in the castle to get to all viewpoints."

There is a little mobile caf\u00e9 near the entrance, which was OK and there is a larger caf\u00e9 in the centre of the castle near the toilets.There are fantastic views of Lisbon from the castle. The castle itself has been partially restored and it is possible to walk along around it, although the stairs are uneven and do not have any bannisters, so be careful. There is a display room showing some of the archaeological artefacts that have been found at the castle and some displays on the castle's history.Allow around 90 minutes for a visit."

But no, I was impressed from the moment I passed through the main gate and viewed the city and bay below. Breathtaking views. This is a great place to begin a visit to Lisbon - here it is, 180 degrees from below the castle and 360 degrees at the highest points. The castle itself impressed me too. I found myself imaging the might of the aristocracies that have occupied it, the ferocity of battles fought there, the generations of diverse peoples who occupied it over the centuries. The castle has been reconstructed in the last century, so it's no exact replica, but it still stirs the imagination. As another reviewer said, the interpretive signage is not very good and doesn't provide much information about history (as does the Jeronimos Monastery exhibit of the history of the monastery, in parallel with that of the world and the country of Portugal). Yet, it's a lovely spot to enjoy. Sunday morning is a great time to visit - less tourists. Go early. Plenty of shade. Lovely gardens in which to wander, and even a cafe where you can rest your feet."

The tours are frequent. It took me a while to work out how to get to the ruins as there was a gate preventing access and no obvious route. In fact you have to climb up onto the castle walls to get round. Apparently this is a recent change because the number of visitors was damaging the previously open archeological site so perhaps there's been no time to put signs up yet. Our guide spoke Portuguese, English and Spanish and was extremely knowledgeable. Those big white enclosures that several of us assumed were to block off the site turned out to be outlines of the Moorish houses, complete with courtyard gardens.The cafe was overpriced and the only place I've yet seen in Lisbon with a poor selection of cakes."

I would definitely recommend walking up to the castle as its not as far as it looks and you walk past all the traffic and beat any other method of transport up there. The queues for the trams mean that we were at the top of the hill before anyone standing in the queue. We walked on a hot day, 37 degrees, but the walk was shady and not too steep.The castle itself is lovely to wonder around with plenty of shady spots to get away from the sun. It's great to look down over the city and orientate yourself. The camera obscura is also very interesting although the queues can be quote long and each presentation is given in a different language but we went to a Portuguese one, being at the front of the queue at the right time, which was fine as it was still interesting to see the views and didn't really need the narration."

With help from local people we found the access route to the castle entrance. Around the castle are a number of very good quality craft and gift shops well worth a browse. The castle, itself is an interesting building with great views on the clear sunny day over the city and beyond. It has a very nice caf\u00e9 with the entertainment of flying peacocks jumping from branch to branch in the trees in the outside eating area. On our descent from the castle we came across a free car park elevator taking us much more quickly down to the downtown area. I would recommend the castle as a must to visit."

If you are uncomfortable with heights, you will not enjoy climbing the ramparts, which do not include sufficient hand railings on the stairs.We had dinner at the restaurant on the grounds--Casa-do-Leao. We didn't have a reservation and were initially told none were available, but were able to get in following a cancellation. A reservation gives you access to the castle at night (I assume just in close proximity to the restaurant). The food was pretty good, it wasn't too expensive, and wait staff was excellent. I don't think you would eat at the restaurant on its merits alone, but as part of the castle experience, it is a worthwhile dining experience.The museum has a small, but nice museum that I suspect 90% visitors never visit. Provides a nice overview of the castle's history."

Amazing views, children loved exploring and running around. Thoroughly recommend. We left late morning to a huge queue for tickets and the old town unrecognisable due to number of people/cars/trams etc. I would definitely get up early and get there so you can enjoy it un-busy and without queuing!"

Skip the 100m+ queue & lengthy wait for the 'castelo' tram in the city centre and head up to the castle on foot.You will be rewarded with a pleasant, albeit slightly demanding, journey through non-tourist locales. Narrow cobblestone roads wind up the hill, passing locals going about their daily business, interesting tile art, intoxicating aromas of food, old men sitting in the street & many hole-in-the-wall drink stops/cafes. Walk as fast or as slow as you like following the well posted signs (you really can't get lost!). The wait in the ticket line at the main entry may be disheartening after the long walk, but there is much to distract you here, and multiple ticket tellers means the line moves quickly. Our wait was only 10-15 minutes. We paid 20Euro for the family (of 4) ticket.Plan to spend 2+ hours at the Castelo. The information boards are very interesting and the views are fantastic. The exhibit was good, if not only for a break in the air-conditioning! The courtyard on the SE side is very shaded with ample places to sit down for a rest & the small coffee shop & icecream stand was welcomed by all members of the family. For those wanting to buy lunch, there is also restaurant on the SW side. For the romantics, there are also a couple vendors on the SW selling wine & bubbly - a great opportunity to sip away at sunset! The toilets are very clean, modern & have change tables.Kids will love walking on top of the walls and posing in front of the gun placements. A couple of loud peacocks will also get their attention. Overall, a very interesting and well-preserved historical monument.Don't forget your camera!"

The design is interesting and the views of the city are beautiful.We took tram 28 (which was crowded and awkward) to get to the castle and enjoyed walking around the small streets leading up the castle. I suggest packing some snacks or lunch to picnic at the castle. We got some food at the castle cafe and we were very unimpressed. (Inedible, in my opinion) However, it would have been nice to relax a little longer in the castle and overlook the city. We left to get some food nearby, with equally nice views."

It is a medievil castle built in 11th century and the walls are well preserved so that visitors have great view of the city and can take lovely pictures but that is all! The price is 8,5 euros, and there is a discount for students under 25, but my friends and I couldn't get this discount even though we are students under 25 and we had EYCA card and a student card from our country but I guess you need to show the ISIC cart that we didn't had. Anyway, at the entrence you can get free broshures that includes brief history of the castle and most importantly map of the place. The biggest impression for me, beside the view, was the Black chamber with camera obscura that provides 360 degree view of the city in real time. And that is it! You can visit the whole place in an hour (and that includes visiting the black chamber that lasts around 15-20 minutes). If you are coming here only for the view my advice is save your 8.5 euros and visit some other viewing points in the city that are free."

The castle is in the centre of Lisbon, on an escarpment, while many of its walls extend around the citadel into the city areas that surround it to the east and south.It is is popular pastime trying to catch the tram 28 up the hill, but my advise would be to drop this and walk up - the tram 28 is horrendously packed by tourists going to Alfama during the day - and a walk up enables you to see other quarters of the Alfama area. If you're keen on riding the 28, it's better to take it down from the citadel hill - or maybe take the 12 down which stops on the Pra\u00e7a da Figueira. Depending on where you ascend from, you can squeeze in a visit in the Cathedral The Citadel gives you wonderful and wide spanned views of Lisbon which are wonderful on a sunny day. On a rainy and windy day it is less interesting, as the wind is thrown round the escarpment and the walls of the fortress, which makes the usage of umbrellas moot.There is an entry fee to the uppermost part - be aware that a family ticket can save you money. Once inside you can enjoy the remainder of the castle and fortress. At intervals there is even reenactment of medieval battle techniques by skilled actors - highly recommended - especially for the kids.The views alone justifies a visit, but do enjoy the other benefits as well. If you're looking for some local watering holes on the way down (or up) go for those on the eastern and northern side of the castle, as they in my opinion is a bit less touristy that the ones along the route of the tram 28."

The views from here are absolutely amazing - it's a photographer's dream. I would recommend you wear comfortable and sturdy shoes as some of the grounds may be uneven.

The views are simply stunning with a 360 panorama from the highest points. The castle has a restaurant and a lovely cafe in the courtyard which is populated by peacocks. The cafe is very reasonably priced considering the rip prices you pay in some places where there is a captive audience. At 17\u20ac for two adult tickets this is great value for money and an experience you can't get in many places."

The castle grounds are open daily from 9am to 9pm (summer hours). The feature attraction is the 11th century Moorish castle which remains much in tact. You can explore much of the exterior and interior of the castle. Inside, the castle is open and mostly gutted so there isn't much to view. However, you can access the walls in a couple of areas, where you are afforded impressive views of the city. Also worth seeing is the permanent collection of archeological finds which date human habitation of this Castelo de Sao Jorge grounds to at least 7th century B.C. Behind the castle you will find actual archeological sites. Access is limited but you can still get a good look at the grounds. Of particular interest is the Tower of Ulysses, which includes the 16th century optical device that provides 360 degree views of the surrounding city. This particular attraction doe have timed entry and limited visitor restrictions, making it potentially inconvenient to visit if you don't have much time for Castelo de S\u00e3o Jorge. What we probably enjoyed best about our visit was simply the viewpoints which line the hillside of Castelo de S\u00e3o Jorge facing the central areas of Lisbon. These views are outstanding, especially if you have a camera with long lens. You can make out popular attractions and squares like Rosso quite clearly. Overall, Castelo de Sao Jorge is a nice inclusion to a day of sightseeing in the Alfama district. The grounds are family friendly and easy to independently explore. Give yourself 60-90 minutes before continuing onward with other sightseeing intentions in this area of Lisbon."

            "review": "Special place in my heart. St George's castle is high above the city of Lisbon, and has panoramic views right across the city and river. You can see the statue of Jesus on the opposite river bank, exactly the same as the one in Rio. I've been here several times, and there are almost always musicians playing in the area with trees, and the music is classical mainly, either harps, acoustic guitars or violins.....beautiful, and very fitting for this Moorish castle. Time has lost a lot of the castles finer points, but you can still see that in its heyday, this castle had a thriving population, water systems to cool off in the heat and very much more sophisticated lives than I had previously realised. It's probably because I've now seen many more Moorish buildings since we first came here, but I find places like this really interesting. Lovely places to sit and pace yourself walking around the building, but It's not a place for those who have balance or walking issues, I'm afraid and there is no place to drink or eat. However, there are some outside the castle so that wasn't a problem for us. I have an overall impression of calm when I look back, and I love the atmosphere it evokes, which is greatly helped by the music. Coming from health and safety obsessed England, it strikes me as odd that the stony stairs have no rails to hold, except for pieces of rope at the most difficult stages. However, I mustn't complain: you see, my husband proposed to me here, and told me he wouldn't hold my hand and help me down the rickety steps unless I married him! We had the embarrassment of being applauded and then serenaded by a group of Americans, who became our personal paparazzi! Lovely memories!"

So wear flat shoes with rubber soles !Try to visit either early to avoid the crowds, or late for the end of day sun over the city. The castle absorbs hundreds of tourists easily but when we left at 12 the queue was snaking down the hill.On leaving, just wander a while in the back streets around the castle; lovely old buildings and a sense of real living still carrying on. A great way to spend a few hours."

Because of the height of the hill it stands on, the views of the city are magnificent. On entering the castle itself, there is not an awful lot to see, as its mostly empty walls & you have to use your imagination as to how it might once have looked. Also, as seems normal in Portugal, there are no signs or information as to what each room is. One highlight has to be the camera obscura. A twenty minute talk about the sights of Lisbon as viewed through the camera in real time. Kids would love the view of 'tiny' people going about their business in the streets below. Also, you might even see a plane coming in to land. Expect to queue for this though, as they can only allow 20 people in at a time. The archaeological site can only be accessed with a guided tour & is mostly inside, so not much to see if you don't take the tour. You can spend a pleasant couple of hours here but don't expect too much."

There was a long queue to purchase the tickets and in almost 39 degree heat, it added to the frustration of being disappointed with the site itself. Perhaps better to go early in the morning or late evening if you really want to walk around. However check the website for timings. The walk up to the castle is hilly and paved with cobblestones that can get quite slippery. There are a tonne of shops selling souvenirs and perhaps the only saving grace of going up here for us was a little shop near the pasteis de nata shop selling magnets based on watercolour paintings which is worth checking out. In hindsight I wish we had skipped this stop altogether, ridden the tram for the experience and spent more time on other tours."

I went in the evening and it was getting a little chilly by then and with hindsight I should have gone a little earlier. It was reasonably priced to get in and the atmosphere of the place was quite nice. One thing I should note is use suitable footwear otherwise you will have trouble getting around the place.

Ok sure it doesn't have the artefacts and rooms all made up as you would get in many palaces, but personally I don't really like that. It seems much less genuine than going to a castle as it was. It is really rather impressive. The courtyard outside the drawbridge is lovely with great views out over Lisbon, a few canons, and a restaurant or two. Then you can go inside the castle, see the different areas and walk the walls. The walk of the walls is quite great. I felt straight out of Game of Thrones! There are brilliant views over the city and you can really get a feel of the fortifications of the castle. We also did the Camera Obscura tour which was actually brilliant and gave us a good orientation of the city. We went up to the castle around 9.30am and there weren't many visitors there at that point which was a great time to get around without the crowds and heat. I recommend the castle and allow at least 2 hours."

It was 7pm so we thought what the heck. When we went in the front gate we found a performance happening, a mixture of music, mime and comedy with lots of audience participation. It was charming. Add the back drop of the best view in town and the castle grounds and ruins and you get an unexpected magical evening. There are performances through out the summer and there is a schedule at the castle gate. This is one of the best 360 views in town."

Only spent one day there this time but this was and remains the number one site that I recommend on a Lisbon visit. As noted by others the castle is not super intrinsically interesting beyond being a castle with nice grounds and battlements you can walk along, as can be found with lots of castles elsewhere in this part of Europe, but it is the tremendous views out over the city and river. There is a restaurant in one of the main viewing areas in the castle grounds and of course some outside in the quaint local streets. The other real experience in visiting the Castelo is walking the \"neighborhood\" to get there and/or back. I suggest walking not taking a cab or bus if ok with hills. You can take the tram up but may have a long wait in tourist season. There are really interesting staircases and narrow streets up the hill from near the main downtown plazas that take you past small cafes and shops, houses with old decorative tiles etc. From the southeast corner of Placo de Figuero, which is one of the main downtown plazas, walk about 100 metres along Rua dos Fanquieres and to your left a staircase leads up to Rua de Madalena and then an arch across the street starts the narrow winding stairs up towards the Castelo. If you do not like the uphill hike too much you can take two elevators to get you much of the way up. The first is located at 170 Rua dos Fanqueiros. Get at out at the floor marked Castelo then go left on Rua de Madalena a short distance and right on Largo Chao do Loureiro (sign posted to both the castle and elevator) to the supermarket and take the elevator to the restaurant. This gives access to the street, turn right and that does not leave that much of a hike up to the castle, which is sign posted along the way."

I need to say at the outset that we live close to a great many very good castles and are spoiled, but we visited two good castles on our Portugal holiday, this one and the Moorish Castle in Sintra. Both were very interesting in their own ways. Castle St George is accessed via a steep hill (its Lisbon and its a castle which is always on top of the biggest hill around), so sorry for stating the obvious! It is very well preserved and is quite large with plenty of levels. Take your time walking to it and around it. There are areas where you can sit and just take in the excellent views across Lisbon, it is worth the entry price just for the views alone. Buy some water on the way up - 50 cents per bottle further from the castle up to 2 euros per bottle just by the entrance. Its hot work getting up there but make the effort, you are burning enough calories to have a good meal and a bottle of wine."

There's one little attempt at a museum in a small room of pottery but I wouldn't be surprised if they broke a few in half to make it seem like more. The one thing it has going for it is the view, which is spectacular. But Lisbon's a hillside town so there are views everywhere without an entrance fee. There are also a couple of peacocks running around that everybody follows and takes pictures of because they'll look much better on their IG page than old walls.

There's endless paths to nowhere. The worst was the giant staircase of death where you'd think it leads to something worthwhile to see but takes you to a dead end after all that huffing and puffing, leaving you pissed off that now you have climb up all those friggin' stairs for absolutely nothing! The views are good but you can get better views for free at Miradouro de Sao Pedro de Alcantara instead of paying 9 euros for a worthless castle."

Getting there is pretty cool, whether walking the narrow streets through Alfama, jumping on a tram and being freaked out by how insanely steep and narrow the track is, or going on a tuk tuk type tour.We elected to catch a tram (28) and were dropped at the Miradouro da Graca. From here we checked out the views which were quite stunning prior to paying to use a public toilet (novel) then asking a local street seller for directions to the Castelo. Mistake! I tapped this gentleman on the shoulder asking for directions, and with that he broke into a massive diatribe about the area, how to get to places and then gave both myself and my wife a free bracelet. He said, take them, they're free! Sure... as we walked off he asked how much I was willing to pay for the information he gave me. And there was no way he was going to leave it at. He wanted to be paid.Point! Don't ask a person selling cheap rubbish (selfie stick, sun glasses etc) anything!Anyway, then we wended out way up to the Castelo where we paid for our 8.5 Euro tickets, and proceeded to the main forecourt. My immediate thought was WOW! But this really is where the wow ended. The forecourt and the views from the Castelo are very nice, however the Castelo itself is very forgetful with limited goings on and very little to look at."

I love this place with my soul, I believe there is a kind of historical magic there - and I knew it a long time ago, when it had a lake (like a castle's moat) with swans. Now, the lake disappeared, there is grass and sand, with peacocks. And It is a very known and visited place, to explore the ruins and the marvelous views of the city. I still love it and I return every travel to see how the place is. I believe it is a little bit \"fake\", because it was lost, as a castle, explored longtime like a militar and bureaucratic place, and suddenly (salazarism?) one decided to change the mass into touristic attraction. So, there aren't many things to see (rooms, exhibitions, relevant information). But it doesn't matter - I will love it forever, as it was a true slice of History."

Fantastic views of the city from all angles and many picture taking opportunities. You can walk along the upper areas of the castle walls which are very narrow but afford you fantastic views (careful with small children). The only complaint is with the ticket prices for families as you MUST have 2 children to get the cheapest price. We have only one child and were 'penalized' and extra 2.50 Euros for this. This is the second tourist location in Lisbon were this happened and I think the management of these sites needs to think about that and price it for families the same whether you have 1 or 2 children. In fact the ticket sales person agreed with us and said that they mention this all the time to management but nothing changes. Maybe if more people write this is their reviews things will change...."

Unfortunately it was raining pretty hard, but it was still a beautiful walk as we passed through many beautiful neighborhoods and other landmarks. When we arrived, I found the ticket prices a bit high, but after going inside, I found the price to be worth it - the castle definitely beat my expectations. You get a panoramic view of the city and even on a cloudy/rainy day, this was very impressive. The architecture and history of the castle was very interesting to me as well. It was a lot of fun climbing the different towers and exploring each section of the castle. The highlight for me though was seeing so many peacocks in one place. They are very boisterous and entertaining to watch. Definitely wear comfortable and non-slip shoes here as there are many steps to climb (if you want to explore that area). I felt very bad for one woman who was wearing ankle booties with a high heel."

            "review": "Views and History. As castles go, this one was underwhelming for me, even though it's from the medieval era, one of my favorites eras! It is just a ruin--a shell- of its former self. But, since it was built by the Moors in the mid-11th century, I found its architecture intriguing. The stone on the ground and in the walls carries a history and draws you in---if you are so inclined. This was a residence for the elite and royalty once, after Lisbon was conquered in 1147, even though it seems its main purpose was for protection. It was once very active as a palace and residence, though, complete with coronations, through the 14th, 15th and 16th centuries, after which it was fortified for defense. In the 19th Century, after it had been previously ravaged by an earthquake, it then became a military barracks. Much of the original structure had been built over. Still, it's pretty amazing to see such antiquity still existing, even if only bits and pieces of it!The walk up the winding cobblestone road is interesting in that there is lots of old architecture to see. I love old cities! Old stones, old cities, old bones\u2026.they have a texture and history that I find soulfully interesting. Some of the quarters closer to the castle were once residences of the elite, apparently. It can be a challenging walk, so you can get a taxi or Uber to the top if you want. Uber works well here! They also have a Tramcar (#12, #28) that will get you almost there. Once inside, there are lots of shade trees to shelter you from the strong sun, and places to take good photos and/or sit and relax while enjoying the view of the city and bay. I didn't take the tour. It just didn't seem that interesting. The grounds are quite large, and you can occupy yourself here easily for a solid couple of hours or more. You can walk inside a part of the castle to see artifacts in glass cases that have been retrieved from the archaeological site. Inside this exhibition building was beautiful, as it\u2019s the old structure. Down some ancient staircases, around the bend and through a door, lead the way to the clean and well-maintained toilets.We climbed to the top of the ruins along one of the fortress walls, and the view was even more spectacular! Actually, it's very high up and a steep stairway at one point, and since I have this little issue with heights at a certain level, I didn't go quite to the very tippy top! It's still a great view from where I was though. There are a few towers you can explore, and we didn\u2019t actually get to all of them! After walking around the sprawling grounds and ruins for a couple of hours in the heat, we were ready to relax and have a cold drink. Always carry bottled water with you, however, because it does get very hot here. The cafe is casual and good with outside picnic tables under huge shade trees. We had wine with our sandwich and yummy pastries while a Peacock perched and posed for photos right next to us! Of course, he/she wanted a little snack too. I'd keep that simple though, such as a tiny piece of break or crust, because I'm sure it's not too healthy for them. While eating, a swoosh made me turn around and see one of these huge birds fly up into one of the huge trees where I saw about 6-8 others. Pretty amazing since they're so big! They weren't directly above us, which could pose a problem (if you know what I mean!), but to the side of us a bit, in a huge tree. They were beautiful, elegant and well-behaved.We went in May, before the peak of the tourist season, so it was a little less congested. If you want to do the tour, I'd suggest coming early to queue up, because I think it must get very crowded here during peak season. Be ready to do lots of walking. And, wear a hat!"

The walk through surrounding Alfama to the castle is also amazing. When at the castle we managed to see the tour with a camera obscura that happens in various languages every half hour until 5PM. It is essential that you line up as soon as possible for this because they can only take 20 people at a time. There was a very rude family who freaked out when they were told there was no room for them in the last tour of the day.

The views were fantastic of the city, the cafe was perfect to sit outside and enjoy a snack with beverages ( including wine), the bathrooms were clean & the onsite restaurant looked top notch ( didn't eat there but would of considered if we hadn't already eaten). From the roaming peacocks and friendly cats, the small museum & the ability to climb all over the castelo, I highly recommend visiting... Plus the route to the castelo is beautiful (but uphill, so I advise a tuktuk)."

The views are spectacular and give a great overview/perspective on the city. The castle itself is very interesting, the main structure including the walls having been rebuilt. Good fun. There is also a Camera Obscura which is worth a visit (Great for kids of all ages)."

You can also take a tram to get here. There is an entrance fee of 8.5 Euros to be paid at the entrance. Inside the castle, you can have a 360 degree view of the city going around the castle.

There is also a fine small museum giving the history of the place with artefacts and pictures. But then make a full afternoon or morning of it by walking slowly down through Alfama - the old Moorish district - with its exotic narrow streets and tiled houses and the quaint very old-world trams. Have a quick beer at the bottom then take in the delights of the Fado Museum as well. Four or five hours to remember with great pleasure."

The view after you enter is magnificent and the history of the city, the country is unfolding at your feet, eyes and mind! WAW! even 4 a day and you have to do it, to see it end feel it! After some time, when you live the site , you, the tourist, will fell that a part in the old continent has opend up with the secrets of how and why have developed during after the Roman Empire has vanished and a new era has come over.!!! all are my personal opinion of course as an \"accidental traveler\" as I am."

Do watch for pick pockets in this area as they blend in with the tourists. We loved watching the beautiful peacocks that live up in the grounds.

Everything has been rebuilt \"maybe\" respecting the original look of the place. But since the structure has been used for centuries for many different things, what you see is basically a XX century view of what a medieval castle was!If you like Disney movies, though, you won't be disappointed!"

This was Lisbon's ancient seat of power for 400 years, the battlements you see today were totally restored in the 1920'sWe could not face the walk up through Alfama so we cheated and grabbed a taxi from our hotel. At the castle entrance, they have a very modern and sophisticated ticket office, and you can collect a brochure on the history etcAs you walk around the battlements, stop for a while to take it all it, there are many places to sit - the views are totally fabulous, Alfama to the left, the River Tagus and all aspects of the city. There are many original gun emplacements, the odd statue, a permanent exhibition on site a small shop and a lovely outdoor caf\u00e9/restaurant.Brilliant to wander around for an hour or so, then a taxi back down into the city."

Quality of sandwich poor but it didn't seem important. Our one-year old loved the peacocks in the courtyard. Free public toilets, too, just down some steps.We did not really take in nor appreciate the castle, I am sorry to say. Just the surroundings were enough for us.

Half demolished walls and it is all up to your imagination. The walk through Alfama is very very beautiful, but I wouldn't recommend going in the castle."

We took a taxi from the Tile Museum (also worth a visit) and started to climb around the walls. Lisbon itself is a great city, but after the traffic and crowds in the old city it was great to get up into the fresh air with a view of the entire city below. This is a place where you can really feel the history and envision the people living here. Highly recommended."

Sadly it was left until 1938 before being renovated in to the castle we see today. Many towers and fortified walls to walk on and discover and there are large grounds and lots of seating area. Many people bring own food. Gives the best veiws over Lisbon City Centre. Also many peacocks roaming around. Restaurant and shop and public toilets all inside the castle grounds. Entrance in castle grounds and castle is 8.50\u20ac. Free colour castle guide in English. Many good souvenir shops outside of castle grounds. Best to walk up from Terreiro do Paco metro station and can be tricky to find. No public parking."

You can easily climb all over the walls of the castle and through their courtyards. There's a lovely little museum with artifacts from the centuries as well as a description of the history of the castle and those who ruled. Getting there is not difficult and you can either take the trolley or you can hike up the hill. There are a lot of small shops just outside the castle gates as well."

Whilst I agree with some that the castle itself is not the most architecturally complex, impressive or complete as many others in Portugal, I equally agree with other reviewers that the castle as arguably the major building in the Alfama, along with the Alfama district itself makes my \"must see\" list for Lisbon. The views from the castle are superb, but there are many other great vantage/view points throughout the city. For me, it was the overall ambience of the Alfama quarter with its narrow cobbled streets, trams out of yesteryear crammed to the gunnels, contrasting architectural styles in a couple of splendid churches, etc., which makes me recommend it as a worthwhile half day exercise. But as other reviewers have said, take comfortable shoes and be prepared to walk off the last night's dinner."

It was fun to walk along the walls, not much to see other then the view, They do have a small museum. Found it a bit dull, but nicely laid out and clean. They do have these peacocks living there.

Regardless we survived on foot going up. Very congested for weekday including local group of school kids. I think it was nice for the city scenery but otherwise you do nothing but climb extremely steep steps nonstop higher and higher for the same city sites. There are cafes and restaurants on site as well. A pair of beautiful peacocks that walk around among people like pigeons without concern especially if you are at the cafe as they are looking for food scraps and call each other back and forth. Be prepared for high pitched shrills that sound like they are being tortured. A quick 2 hours and we were done. Took bus to Rossio plaza as we were done with the hiking. I think I would pass on this unless you have nothing else to do. I would not take small kids or older people as your entire trip is climbing."

Nothing really exciting about it (hence the No) if you like old castle interiors and gardens then his is a no. There is no pretty garden or rooms to admire, just a hollow shell. Yes, because of the views. the view to the river and the city are impressive (hence the yes)it's not expensive \u20ac8.60 it's up to you if you want a good view and no castle ;) also, there is nowhere to shelter from the rain so bring your brolly in rainy seasonHappy travelling."

We went to the Castle primarily to see the archaeological site, but they are only seen from above and at least half of them (the Moorish part) are covered. There is little to no explanatory text to help interpret what you are viewing. As other have noted, the castle is way up in the hilliest part of Lisbon and it's a hike to get there. Once inside the castle, there really isn't a lot to see but empty spaces and then lots and lots and lots of stairs leading up and down hither and yon. The hilly neighborhood around the castle is as interesting as anything you see inside. Overall, it's worth a trip, but not a lot of time."

At the top tickets are not overly expensive and concessions are available. Once the climb has been made it's definitelly worth going in and exploring, and although the interior of the main castle is somewhat bare, the discovered artifacts are all there in the museum to see without extra charge. The archaeological part is interesting as well, but because of the earthquake damage 250 years ago the reconstructions look a bit of guesswork - probably not the case, but that's what they look like. Parts of that section are covered up for protection and access is only on the regular free short guided tours, which usefully helps to explain some of the features. I was impressed that the conservators seem to be taking considerably more care of the wall decorations and exposed pieces of floor than is the case at, say, Pompeii. Seeing the whole site requires good stout shoes, trainers or boots as the paths are very rough, and wheelchair users or others with impaired mobility are in for a disappointment. Finally the views across the city and river are exceptional."

This castle was included into this list. First impression was it's size and the whole construction. It is really in a good condition, especially when knowing about the awful earthquakes that took place in the city. Frankly speaking it is a great real fortress on the rather high hills, you can easily see the picturesque overviews of the Lissabon from the top of the fortress.

The castle itself is fairly uninteresting; lots of 1930s-1940s reconstruction so it's unclear which bits are original, it's very crowded and peacocks are screaming incessantly. The views are nice, though. There is a free castle tour (some tours are in English, some Spanish, some Portuguese, so check before you go when your preferred language is offered) but this is not very good: our guide did not speak English well and did not manage to paint a clear picture of the castle's history - she talked mainly about how hard it was to attack. Might be interesting for kids, though.What's really interesting about this place is the archeological site at the far end. Again, there's a guided tour, and this is the only way to see it. It's amazing - you can see remains of Moorish houses with the original floor and wall decoration still intact, parts of the later palace, and well-preserved remains of Iron-age houses. The site has been developed well - it gives a very clear impression of what life was like in these periods, and our guide was very good. This alone is worth the entrance fee! Once you've seen this, go to the museum to look at the objects recovered from the archeological site."

If you never experienced a \"dark room\" Camera Oscura, thre's one in the one of the fort tower and it is a unique experience to take."

It was a nice walk from the city center to Castelo de Sao Jorge, yes upwards but really good to see the differences in buildings and standards as we got nearer the castle.The Moorish neighborhood all back from the 11th century was really nice. As we \"climbed\" upwards, it was easy to understand that why the castle was build in the 11th century on this difficult to access place. Some nice cafees, bars and restaurants gave us some good pit stops on our journey among all the nice, old buildings. The view from the castle was just great, overviewing the city of Lisbon.Really majestic sights.The castle has got 11 towers remaining, and some original cannons was in place. The castle is the former Royal Palace of Alcacova. The area is held in good shape, including the areas of the Romantic Garden. Even though the palace was heavily suffering after the earthquake in 1755, we could see the drawings of the city and the castle prior to the earthquake in the permanent exhibition. And not to forget, it is a nice walk down to the city center again after this great experience, or you can take one of the old yellow trams."

A big queue to buy tickets but once we were inside there was enough space for everyone and it didn't feel crowded.Very impressive structure but it was all about the views for us. We wandered around the walls taking in the incredible sight of the city way below. You get some great views of the River and the Alfama and all the houses with their colourful walls and roofs.Much of the castle is a shell but it is fun to explore, steps to climb and nooks and crannies to peek into and lots of grassy areas with peacocks everywhere strutting their stuff.A Lisbon must-see, those views are unforgettable."

After long trek up the hill (trams available for the weak willed) - we were delighted to find no queues for the castle and reasonable entry fees (c. 14 euros for adult and teenager). Large area to explore including walking the walls and getting a 360 view of the city. Loved the lack of focus on health and safety. Inner walls of the castle also available to explore and cafe on site too. Peacocks gave off their best displays to impress the visitors. The size and space of the site meant it felt calm and quiet after the bustle of the city streets."

The castle looks fantastic when viewed from other parts of the city, but it's not that great when there.Took a 28 Tram to the nearest stop and still had to walk uphill for 10 minutes.Not that clearly marked, so followed the crowds. Entry price was very reasonable and the initial courtyard promised much, with lots of stonework, architecture, trees and brilliant scenic views (ideal for photos)The courtyard lead to inner and outer sections that were disappointing, as there was nothing really to see except stonework & walls.You could take some of the many steps and walk the battlements; but with no handholds, low walls & moderate winds, it felt really unsafe. (I wouldn't take a child up there)Best part of the visit was the cafe: - spent longer in there than walking the whole castle"

Beautiful castle and really great journey through Alfama to get there - get tram 28 if tramping up hills is not your style (we live in South Lakes, England - so hills are a daily occurrence for us!) Lemon trees and orange blossom was made all the better with some fab sunny weather - took picnic and noticed others doing the same - great venue for a picnic!!!!! Castle is really interesting and worth the \u20ac20 for a family ticket - guide leaflets in different languages are free!!!!! Peacocks were roaming and showing their full tails!!!! Called in Church of Se on the way down after exploring beautiful tiled houses in Alfama - very interesting!!!! Best day of week long stay in Lisbon!!!"

Apart from one information panel at the entrance with some general information and overview, and one additional in the \"archeological\" site, there is nothing to read and learn about the place, when certain things were built, what was their purpose, etc. Okay, I didn't see the museum inside (the kids didn't feel like that), maybe it provides more info, but if you are information hungry, get yourself a guidebook or simply resort to learning online, and spend your time here simply enjoying the views and the green."

You can see the Santa Justa lift, the Commercial square, and other noted sights around Lisbon. The railings on the castle wall are very low and may be intimidating to those afraid of heights, especially with many people passing in different directions. The camera obscura is located on the second story of the castle. You have to go into the castle fortress, go to the far right corner and then up the stairs to the middle of the building. The room only holds 20 people and it takes 20 minutes per tour, where the tour can be in English, Spanish or Portuguese depending upon the time of day. Camera Obscura is a huge box camera where through pulleys and levers it can view the cityscape of Lisbon. It is really amazing to see how it operates (moving, focusing) and even more entertaining when you can see people walking in the streets of Lisbon from afar. The castle takes about a 1/2 day to see. The line for tickets to the castle can get long so if you can get there when it opens you should have no problem, especially since the town does not seem to get active until 10 am. The tram can get you up to the castle but you still have a lot to walk uphill. It is best to get mini bus 737 that is located on the square by the Rossio station; it is not crowded like the tram and it is the closest drop off to the ticket office."

I wouldn't recommend taking your small or rambunctious children there. Much of the exhibit was closed on our visit. The interior of the castle interested me little, (if you are a history buff it is likely for you) but the views outside overlooking Lisbon are spectacular - so go for that reason alone."

The castle itself was very interesting and the views were amazing, however its not a great place to visit if you don't like heights. Lots of little restaurants around the foot of the castle, serving nice food, if a little pricey but shop around. Lots of annoying people trying to sell you sunglasses etc while you are eating though. The walk back down the hill into the city is lovely and you can visit some very pretty churches, nice ice cream shops etc."

When I got to the castle tickets were easy and quick to get. The terrace park at the entry of the complex is amazing as are the friendly peacocks that roam the area. The weather then changed and became cold and wet. Obviously no fault of the venue. The thing about wet in Lisbon is that the pavements then become fatal. The castle is no exception to this. The archeological dig requires you to be there at specific times to gain access. At the end of my visit the sun was out again and the terrace area was just brilliant and the views are outstanding. Just be aware the pavement and more importantly the steps. And of course the crowds."

We walked to the castle and after getting lost many many times, finally came up the back way only to find out we had to walk literally 3/4 of the way around to find the sole entrance. It's up & downhill so our calves were killing us!! But it was so worth it.The view from the castle is amazing. The stairs up and down in the castle would definitely NOT meet North American safety standards and for anyone with vertigo, could be paralyzing in places but the view from the top of all points of this castle is worth risking the trip up. We just missed the 5 PM guided tour of the archaeological excavation happening in one portion of the castle with the oldest artifacts and history, so that was a bummer. But walking around, reading about how this castle survived the earthquake, seeing how defensible the castle really was, and walking the stone parapets was an experience not to be missed. I don't know how so many women wore heels to this site.The highlight- peacocks roaming around pathways and lazing high above trees. Who sees that in the wild anyway? And if you can stay for sunset, the pictures are stunning, as is the view of the city and the river. Cost: for a family of four- 8 Euro. Time spent- about 2 hours total."

Do be wary of the uneven ground and maybe pickpockets crowded outside the entrance to the castle.

Not the best for walking round due to the extremely uneven cobbles under foot. The views more than make up for all this."

You can see the whole of the city from all directions and a sea of Portugese standard terra cotta roof tops. There's plenty of places to sit down and enjoy the views, which was very much needed as we climbed the numerous steps. Not for the faint hearted, elderly or less mobile but definitely worth a visit for the views. Tip - get the tram 28 to the castle from its start at Martin Monitz for an authentic ride round the backstreets of Alfama and Garca.

Once the sun had gone down we decided to explore the castle grounds and building....health & safety doesn't seem to exist here, and to be honest, quite glad of that on this occasion as was pretty special going around on our own and seeing parts that would definitely be off limits back home! Touring at night and the season meant it was fairly quiet but do be careful if going so late as you really need to watch your step. Worth a visit.

Basically the castle has been returned to its medieval origins, but that measn there is little but walls there. You must have the guided tour which really bring s the place alive - puttiing it into historical context. Tours in English for monoglots. It's an easy ten minute stroll back to town as well."

Great for pictures and what I found the most interesting is you get a really good look at the way people live in Lisbon, looking right into their beautiful small walled gardens. This is old Lisbon where I stayed with great restaurants, shopping, and easy walking down to all the sites, you just need to cab or tuk-tuk it back up the hill. The castle and grounds are amazing and the history of the site is worth reading about before you go to really appreciate the history.

The views from the castle grounds are wonderful and you can see for miles. The walk around was excellent, even though it was very windy. After spending 20 mins walking around the ground we left and headed down the hill to get to the city centre. My advice would be to take the slog up the hill, maybe using the tram and then make sure the castle is actually open."

The peacocks were beautiful and would stay with you for photo oppertunities for as long as you had something to feed them. After that they wandered over to the next person willing to indulge them"

I walked (via the free elevators) up to the castle - lovely views over Lisbon from the ramparts (still have to pay entrance fee for this area). I didn't time my trip right for any tours - not sure that if these are advertised in advance as they do different languages at different times - they may have helped to give more info. Seeing as most of the castle was rebuilt in the late 1930s it all felt a bit manufactured compared to castles in the UK. Great views and a nice wander but probably worth trying to get one of the free tours to get more out of it."

For this reason, I think it would be great with a family, but less successful for those with mobility issues. I actually enjoyed it enormously and used up a lot of energy climbing up and down, particularly enjoying the trip all the way down to the Gate of St Lawrence which is protected by ramparts on both sides. My guidebook was scathing about the Camera Obscura and said it was not worth visiting but as it was my first day, it was a great way to find out what everything was in Lisbon and to learn something of the city as well as finding out how it worked, all in English too. I waited less than 5 mins.There are some archaeological remains on the site too but sadly these can only be visited by guided tour and the timing did not fit in with me.

Amazing views of the city, you can walk along the walls and imagine what it was like to have been a knight defending the city. Parts of the walls are a bit scary for those scared of heights, but the steps and pavement, railings etc. are all well maintained so it's perfectly safe.A little bonus is there are some peacocks walking around, we even saw a partially albino one. One disappointment was the food - we decided to skip the on-site restaurant after a quick glance at the fare and prices, but then all the restaurants outside were very bad tourist-trap looking places.

The castle has exposed stone stairways leading up to high open castellated battlements, which provide fantastic views of the city, but this attraction is a health and safety nightmare for any person who errs on the side of safety. Probably better suited to teenagers and adults and not young children. There are numerous signs warning of the potential hazards of falling, and on a blustery day, they should be heeded. The potential hazards were not identified before entering the castle so you might feel slightly cheated if you don't fancy venturing up onto the battlements to take full advantage of the views. Obviously H&S is a balancing act. No guard rails is the choice the castle guardians have chosen, with warning signs, of the potential to fall from height, in place. You pays your money and take your chance."

If possible visit during a weekend when it is really alive as the locals also visit this cultural landmark to stroll and socialize. I was most struck by the history contained within these walls, from the Moors to the Romans to modern day Portugal this place has been occupied and a key element in the history and development of this once powerhouse country.

The castle is very well maintained and parts are still under construction. This does not detract from the beautiful panoramic view and the pleasant walk around the grounds. There are some steep steps to climb if you want to walk along the high wall, the climb is worth it. There are peacocks hiding around the ground and it was nice to see them.

There are a couple of places to get a drink and snack (not the cheapest but it is one of the main tourist traps in the city).Overall good value for money, and a \"must-see\" when visiting Lisbon"

The view of the city makes it worth the trek up to it through several winding streets. One of the downsides are the trinket sellers outside the main entrance to the castle. You have to worm your way through them to get to the visitor's center to purchase your tickets. Once inside you don't have to worry about the vendors. Again the view is amazing and if you want to walk the high walls you can. An important note here is that unlike Obidos, Almourol castle or pretty much any other historic site with high walls, St. George's walls at least have guard railings along the walls and up the steep steps. Anywhere else its a big nasty fall if you are not careful and I heard stories from tour guides that careless folks have died. This should not be the case for St. George. The castle also has a small archeology museum that is quick to walk through since there isn't much there. There are quite a few peacocks mulling around which are fun to look at!"

Streets filled with ornate tiling, graffiti that borders on being artwork and tiny galleries and caf\u00e9s on either side of you. The castle itself while being just a ruin has lots of nooks and crannies for kids to explore and lots of steps and battlements to climb for various beautiful views of Lisbon. My advice would be to take the time to stop and have a coffee or a beer at the restaurant there, the view is really something to behold and the rest will reenergise you for even more climbing and exploring! All in all a wonderfully enjoyable experience."

Taking the 28 Tram there might seem idyllic but its packed with a huge wait to get on. I'd suggest using the more lightly used 12 Tram instead which ends up at the same place & you're more likely to get a seat. For the less mobile, the 737 bus is easier to use and drops you much closer to the castle entrance. Being an ancient building there are lots of steps with few alternatives. There's plenty of places to eat & buy souvenirs both around & inside the castle."

The gardens are lovely for sitting in. It made for a pleasant watching of the sunset"

The grounds contain a small archeological site. You can't visit the site yourself, you have to go on a tour. Its only a short tour but it does allow you to see inside the buildings that have been constructed to protect the site. I would recommend planning your visit so that you can catch one.I would also recommend bringing your lunch. There is a cafe onsite, but its nice to just be able to site in the gardens and admire the views."

You can trace the history of Lisbon from about the 7th century BC through the Romans to the Moors and then to the Portuguese who took conquered the Moors in 1147 and then on up into the 16th century. You could easily spend 2 hours here looking at the exhibits the museum does you and walking on the ramparts. Remember however that this is at the top of Lisbon and everything is uphill and then everything is downhill. Be prepared for lots of walking."

S\u00e3o Jorge Castle was built by the Arabs in the Eleventh century in a Lisbon high point.Half of Portugal (in the making) ended near Lisboa (Santar\u00e9m). It was vital for the Portuguese King (D. Afonso Henriques) to conquer Lisbon which, in medieval times, meant to conquer the Castle.The Pope Eug\u00e9nio III called for a new crusade. In its way, coming from Dartmouth, they stayed for a short time in Oporto. Oporto bishop convinced them to help the Portuguese King. ..Not for very religious reasons (the loot would be awesome) they agreed and after a 4 months siege the Arabs surrendered.Today it's a superb place to visit; you'll enjoy a magnificent view of Lisbon (actually a 360\u00b0 view) along with Tagus River, you'll see the result of several archaelogical researches, some of them show the occupation of the place by people before the Arabs (sixth century BC):Phoenicians, Greeks, Carthaginians and Romans.If it's your first time in Lisbon it's here you must begin."

Not at all good for visitors with limited mobility. The gardens around the castle are very pretty and it's just a great place to see Lisbon."

Our best pictures are from this location. There's also a restaurant that overlooks the city. We sat at a table but decided not to order. Wine was 8 euros I believe and we weren't ready to eat yet. But it would be worth the price simply because of the view. There's also a cafe on the other side with no view, kind of pricey, but considering its inside the park that's expected.

That was a super advantage with all the climbing throughout Lisbon. As you walk around the fortification you can see all the levels of security. The outer wall, the dry moat, the chinks in the walls for shooting. The multiple levels of towers with that fantastic view was the crown on the security of the castle. It was quite a hike up and down stairs to get around the entire expanse. In a quiet section there is an archeological site that contains remains from three periods of history of the site. Most of it is covered for protection of the remaining artifacts but there is a schedule for free tours which is really worth the time. The 1st era represented was the Iron Age (7th-3rd c BC), there is a Moorish Quarter next 11th-12th c and finally the Palace 15-18th c. The artifacts, seeing the layout of the housing and administrative areas are subtle and very low key. Bits of special tiles etc. are highlighted by the tour guide who really puts the life back into this significant area giving it a fullness that enhanced our visit. We almost missed the lower level museum, well worth seeing."

We were able to walk around and take a lot of photos with hardly anyone else there! A welcome change after a day in touristy Sintra.It's a bit of hike uphill to get there. There's an elevator on Rua da Fanquieros near the wine shop which will take you up a few streets. Then walk across the street and you will see another elevator to the castle (it's near a grocery store). These will save your life!"

There is tremendous historical significance associated with this castle, and the stroll through the 'old town' reinforces the historical significance."

After a glass of wine on the terrace near the overlook, we then leisurely strolled DOWN the hilly streets taking in the local atmosphere along the way. A 'bonus' at the site was that we were lucky to catch up to and join a guided tour of the ongoing archaeological 'dig' that's on site.~ Wear comfortable shoes~ Take your camera & binoculars ~ Don't rush yourselves!

The grounds are extensive and the castle itself full of history. The caf\u00e9 was very good there and we stopped for a quick drink.

The things not to miss here is the general view over the city and the opportunity to walk the battlements.Worth the trip and ticket if you're into castles, though there isn't a ton here (the castle itself is essentially barren, the peacocks on the grounds were an unanticipated surprise)."

Better signposting would help you find the entrance when you arrive on foot as the local streets nearby gave no clues to the entrance so we just kept going higher and higher. There is a lot of graffiti in the area, some of it is very artistic but some is just scruffy and doesn't enhance the experience or architecture. Once inside though the castle is well preserved and you can explore to your hearts content. The views are outstanding and there are lots of viewpoints. The whole site is refreshingly uncommercial so if you expect snack bars and trinkets then look elsewhere. There is lots of archeological information for the site and the views are amazing.

Eventually we stumbled across Castello de Sao Jorge, paid our \u20ac8 or \u20ac9 each for entry and what a treat to see the views we got from this castle, towering above the city! It took us 2-3 hours to wander round the castle and the grounds, climbing some steep (and some arguably not very safe) staircases but the view and the pictures we got of the city made it all worthwhile. Just one word of warning if walking through Lisbon up to this attraction, watch out for thieves, pickpockets and drug dealers, Lisbon is notorious for crime and we had 2 occasions of locals wanting to 'high five' us (a very clever hand flick will remove a watch from your wrist without you even realising) and one even went in for a hug (while his hand would have been in my pocket if I'd allowed). We were also offered Hash twice and cocaine from three separate locals and I can assure you we, although young, do not look likel 'druggies' by any standards haha! As with any city, be alert, keep valuables out of sight and keep your wits about you at all times. Castello de Sao Jorge was great though!"

It's a place for boys (and girls with a little less privacy) to pee if you're not shy.

There are loads of steps going up to lots of points where there are great views. Speaking of views, don't miss the room that has a camera obscura in it. You may need to queue for it; I was lucky - I walked in just as a demo was about to start. I'd guess they only let in about 20 people at a time. It's worth seeing though; mirrors and lenses (manually operated by the staff member) give a really cool panoramic view of the city on a parabolic dish in the centre of the room, all in total darkness.

This is a self guided tour and we would have enjoyed it more if actual guides were available for tours or at least some questions, you miss a lot due to lack of information. We did happen along to a short tour of some archaeological excavations which was really interesting, given by a local student of history - would be great to extend guided tours to the main castle itself. Good entrance price with reductions for seniors & students. Also, we were warned by several local shop-owners to beware of pick-pockets in the streets adjacent to the castle, so be careful!"

There is no interior left but the network if walls and towers are reminiscent of what you thought a castle should look like when you were a kid. Personally I loved it. Be prepared for lots of climbing - in fact, I recommend taking a cab or tuk tuk to the castle so that you aren't worn out when you get there. Climbing all of the walls and checking out all of the varied views is the best part."

This price includes a Camera Obscura, but the queues on my visit, a particularly sunny day, put me off this attraction. Also here is a large ostentation of peacocks, adding to the photography opportunities.In terms of accessing the castle, much of the travel up the hills can be cut out by using the free elevators starting at the east end of Rua da Vitoria."

Easy to reach by foot or tram 28 the main attraction of the castle area certainly is the fantastic view from the terrace or from one of the many towers. And the view always changes so it is worthwhile getting up (or down) to each of the towers. The castle is well maintained but basically is a large ruin consisting of walls and towers, so it is an outdoor experience, nothing for rainy days. There is a small museum displaying coins and pieces of broken pottery found on the premises, not very exciting, but providing some shelter in cases like an unexpected thunderstorm (which we had)."

If you're near Figueira Square, just take the yellow bus 737. It costs less than 2 euros each way. It will have Castelo on the front & the castle is its only stop. Then take it back down. It will then say Figueira, and that is the end of its route. You'll still have a short, steep walk to the castle. I didn't have advance tickets but probably waited no more than 10 minutes. You can get a nice brochure in English that shows the layout and gives an overview. The views are great, even if I was left wondering just how incredible they would be on a sunny day. I didn't try the cafe, but I thought the artifacts were quite interesting in the museum. The exit from the museum takes you past a WC and on through a small, cramped gift shop. On a wet day like today, every pace, wether climbing stairs or walking on a \"flat\" surface, is dangerous. I always wear shoes with soles that have good traction, but here I had to be extra careful of my footing because I was terrified I would fall and break my camera."

The Castle sits on the Highest Point of Lisbon and almost demands Attention to all new Visitors that this should be their first point of call in this City. The best way to get here other than a very strenuous climb is to take the Mini Bus 737 from Martim Monez Square where You will be Dropped right up to the Main Entrance ( Tram 28 runs close but still involves a bit of a Climb after alighting ). After Purchasing Your Ticket from the Main Office take a Guided Map and walk through a Turnstile in to a Large Terrace that gives you a Sweeping View of the Lisbon Panorama.  The Castle itself has some Terrific Views from its Many Battlements and Walkways & has a Beautiful Park in its Interior that is Home To some Wild Peacocks who wander the grounds seemingly Oblivious to the Many Visitors. The Grounds can be seen in about one hour but You should try to stay here a Little Longer to take in the sense of its Long History, from Medieval Cannons that poke out between the crenelations to the Towers at the very top with all their Large Flags Fluttering that still invoke images of the Moors Capture and Eventual defeat right here some Twelve Hundred Years ago.  There are plenty of WC's available as well as a Restaurant and Bar, Museum, a recently discovered Ancient Archeological site as well as the usual gathering of Vendors selling Tourist Bric a Brac. In all. this Should be Your First Point of Call to get an Idea of Lisbon's History that will Help you Better Understand the City on Your Further Explorations around."

They don't. It's good to know, because if you want to do everything you can, but for me, there was no added enjoyment or interest in walking down those steps. There's a small cafe in a nice setting. There's also a restaurant along the walls with a nice view of the city. Plus a little wine cart if you want to stroll the grounds with your glass of wine, or port.I would recommend this attraction, however, if you have been to Sintra already I would not. Once you've done Sintra, there's a feeling of, is there a need to see any other castle....ever? A bit like going to Rome, any other ruins are meh."

We had to queue for 5-10 minutes to buy tickets so if you're on a tight schedule, consider buying in advance to avoid this.The best route is to take Tram 28 up from the centre of town, try the stop in Rossio Square, to save yourself some of the walk. It is then only a short but very steep 5 minute walk to the castle from the nearest tram stop. Although the castle is well kept, be warned there is little beyond the actual walls - this sight is about enjoying the fabulous views. The walls are still great fun to climb for kids and, if you are looking for a more historical visit, make sure to pick up one of the informative leaflets when purchasing your ticket and take time to visit the archaeological site as well. If you enjoy your visit and fancy something similar, make sure to take a trip to the Moorish Castle in the nearby town of Sintra."

It's a hike to get there and you can only see the site with a guided tour (every hour, except at lunch time of course) and the rest of the time the ruins are covered! So you can't even see it from the outside. Of course you can only discover this by hiking up a battlement and walking down from it to read the sign. I mean 8,5\u20ac?? I'd say it's worth maybe 5!

We walked it, with the cathedral providing a very welcome break on the way up.

He appeared hurt and offended that I did not want the \"gift \"and the tried to give my boyfriend a wooden bracelet in the same way. This is a well know scam to mark tourists out as potentially having valuables, little did he know I only had ten euros and no jewellery!I made my boyfriend take the necklace off me and give it back and we left the area asap, however we saw that he then spoke to another man selling necklaces who followed and approached us in a nearby cafe, saying that he had seen us earlier and was watching! At this point we joined the tram queue and left. We felt very unsafe and didn't return to that area at all which was a shame as it was very pretty. Keep cameras and valuables hidden once outside the castle, as we thought we were wise to these scammers but we got drawn in very quickly."

We didn't get to see the popular Camera obscura because bad organisation of the staff is causing huge queues. After 15 min of waiting in the sun we were informed that next english tour will be in 40 min. Archaeological site was closed for some reason, without explanation.

We walked from the Praca do Commercio through the steep old medieval stairs & back streets up towards the Se cathedral, which was picturesque with the tram passing outside etc. we then walked the steep path left up towards the magnificent views over the Alfama district. Once we arrived there we took a small lane filled with graffiti- leading to an improv outdoor art exhibition just behind a strange skeleton of an old prison. Strange vibe form it, like it didn't belong to the place.Then the path widened until we got to the Castelo. A little pricey, 12\u20ac each, but we went up just as the sun was setting, absolutely beautiful views. In a courtyard a crusader statue reminds us of Portugal's incredible history, but while we walked we took some of the best photo's from our trip. The castle walls and interior was well maintained and it's powerful facade has a seemingly ageless appearance. Great visit, probably worth the price. Get a bus back down, we we're fatigued after all the climbing!"

A security guard and a first aid person came to my aid...after my husband helped me the first aid person wrapped my foot in gaze to give it some support and said it probably wasn't broken because I could move a couple of the toes. They couldn't get me out of there fast enough.they kept saying that it would be great if I could walk to the entrance so They could call a cab for us, they didn't even offer to pay for that taxi. It turned out my ankle was broken, the gaze wrapped on my ankle caused a blood circulation issue. A month has passed l am still in recovery and never had a cortesy call or message from the castle administration . I wasn't the only person that fell in there on that day...the staff just didn't same to care.Lisbon is beautiful!

The castle itself was interesting but not much more than an shell. The walking was a little nerve wracking when you had to climb the narrow steps to the castle walls- there was definitely not a enough room for people to come and up and down simultaneously. However, the delight came in the views from the castle grounds- absolutely stunning vistas over and over again. I think I kept taking pictures every time I walked a few feet over. It was really worth it for the views alone. I ate lunch the in courtyard with a simple sandwich and soda from the cafeteria styled cafe inside- you could take your pick from hot lunches, beer, wine,sandwiches, yogurt etc. The prices were a little high but not outrageous. The best part of eating outside the cafe was the tree with peacocks perched in it. I kept seeing people taking pictures of this tree and finally looked up to see 6-7 peacocks sitting in it. On the ground was a mother peacock and probably about 6 babies begging for crumbs. They were a hit. The mother will try to take your food if she stops at your table. Overall, a nice Lisbon site to see and spend some time after walking around the surrounding neighborhood. It's fun to get lost and find cute shops and bars."

Cheap entry fee, beautiful view and great photo taking opportunities and then the castle itself is wonderful. No wheelchair or pushchair access from what I could see. Some steep steps with not much safety hand railing wise so probably not good for young kids but you can still enjoy the castle whilst avoiding the awkward stair climbs. They have a nice gift shop and museum / exhibition part and cafes to chill in and around the castle grounds too. Good family or couples attraction for a morning or afternoon."

Hugho is the affable and friendly owner he is the one who brings olives to his neighbours and speaks to the man across the road with the amazing cat who behaves very territorialy towards his owner crying for him when he goes out. This is the real life of the castle a small community living together in harmony, helping each other out. the castle is what the past was and yet it is also the present reminding the visitor of the conquerors who claimed the area in the artefacts held therein from ancient times and that there are inhabitants of the human kind as well as the wonderful peacocks. There is a small gift shop in the grounds and a cafe and restaurant but the views and the artefacts are wonderful."

And, yes, the site does afford 360 degrees of spectacular views of Lisbon. Try and catch the Camera Obscura if you can ... though it's limited to 15 visitors per showing and may entail a wait in the full sun.

Even when we left several hours later, the queue wasn't very long.We spent hours here! There is a museum which exhibits artifacts found on site from the Iron Age right up to 18th century, and gives a great timeline of the castle's use through that time. Connects the history of Lisbon and Portugal, too.The castle itself, a separate part of the whole, was amazing. You get some great views of the city from atop the walls and within the towers. The stairway down from the castle to the Tower of St. Lawrence is long, which means you have to come back UP to continue your tour, so be prepared. The queue to get into the camera obscura part was a little too long for us, so we skipped it. Before you exit the castle part and cross over the small bridge, turn left and follow the signs to the archeological area. There are some ancient Iron Age areas, some Roman areas, and some Moorish/Muslim areas, and there are guided tours of this small archeological \"dig\" throughout the day, which I recommend.There are many things to see outside the castle proper (the museum I mentioned above, being one). We saw some resident peacocks, a peahen and a chick near the cafe! The entrance fee is 8.5 Euros for adults; you get a lot of bang for your buck, here, depending on how much you want to see."

The castle had a great view and cool details. I would say it's one of the better view of the city. There was an archeologic site all back from the 700's BC and some of the old house walls around 900-1100's AD was rebuilt extending into new walls so you could see how it actually was back then. There was a short walk from here to the monastery nearby."

The Castelo de Sao Jorge was not really high on our list of things to see and do in Lisbon, but we soon were convinced that it was one of the highlights. The ancient structures (some dating back to the Bronze Age) were much more interesting than we had anticipated and just climbing all those ancient stairs and feeling like we were in medieval times was amazing. It is a bit of a climb to get there if you do not choose to take the tram 28 which is apparently only used by tourists and pickpockets (or so every sign we saw warned us), but it is well worth it. Take your kids - they'll just love the fact that they can climb all over the place! The view is breathtaking but we didn't stay until sunset and did the free walking tour instead."

It rained just before we visited and most of the railings were cover with rust as a result, because the paint has long peeled off. We had to be careful not to stain our clothes while taking pictures."

We also bought cherries on our way into the castle and then spent some time savoring the views of Lisbon! Overall we had a very nice time.

As others have mentioned, the views over the city are stunning. The castle itself is in great condition. It would have been nice to have a bit more interpretation around, to explain the buildings and their history, but it was still beautiful as it was. If you're not a fan of heights or have knee problems, the walls will be an issue -- very steep stairs and not always that much in the way of hand railings. There's still plenty to see just wandering on the ground, though. It was really great to see the foundations of buildings that have been dug up and some good explanations of how the castle would have looked if they were still standing."

The Moors built much of the current huge (almost 18,000 feet in circumference) walls. After the Reconquest of Iberia in 1148, it has been further developed with ramparts, and towers and has served as a royal residence and the national archive of the Portuguese nation.

This castle is worth visiting especially because of the Lisbon view. This experience is really worth time and money. I can fully recommend this attraction. For me it was more interesting than Belem. Nice surprise is possibility to meet number of peacocks, just walking around or sitting on a tree what was surprising view and great attraction."

It is located on top of the highest (or one of the highest) points in Lisbon in the heart of the Alfama neighborhood. The Alfama is an historic neighborhood (touristy), but well worth the walk through.The admission to the Castelo is not expensive and it provides incredible views of the city. If you spend a little time, it is fascinating to get an understanding of the Moorish history and how the Moors were conquered by the Portuguese. You can see this in the different architecture (and the signs, which provide information). It is also interesting to see how the lines of defense were created through the structure. There is an archaeolgoical exhibit within the Castelo, but down from the top, which is fascinating. There are also beautiful peacocks walking around within the Castelo walls.If it is hot, there is a nice cafateria to get a drink, snack and go to the bathroom."

It was the only place where we saw notices warning of thieves, and Police were watching the entertainment crowds for trouble.

Third time (on a Tuesday) we actually toured, saw incredible panoramic views of Lisbon. Be forwarned that you mainly tour the outside perimeter and courtyards. Be careful of the many steep narrow steps to climb, some without guard rails. Cobblestone walkways everwhere makes it difficult for the elderly and couples with baby strollers.

The castle stands proudly over the whole of Lisbon and is a major landmark.There is an elevator on Rue San Mameda which makes it easier to get to it and it is free. Would be difficult for those who find walking on steep cobbled surfaces. We went up from Largo Maritim Moniz and is where Tram 28 departs. Wrong move as it is 250 steps or so before you even get onto normal roads. Once there however it is a pleasant vista all over Lisbon right out to the bridge and the River Tagus. No real rooms to see as there are just walls remaining. However a good historical experience and worth the effort. Peacocks roam throughout the castle grounds. BEWARE of PICKPOCKETS in this area."

I am a fit middle aged person and recommend taking a cab to the site, walking ALL over the grounds, climbing every tower and soaking up every vantage point. All views are gorgeous and you really get a feel for the area and history from this visit. THEN, have a beverage to rehydrate and begin the long and entertaining walk down to town. We did not use a map-just followed the winding streets and stairs. We visited the the Cathedral on the way down and ended up at the water. All told, about 2 1/2 to 3 hour visit. It's the perfect thing to do in the morning, before it gets too crowded."

However, it did seem slightly too expensive for what is essentially a fortress with nice views. You can walk around some of the ramparts, but the museums there aren't up to much. The archeological remains aren't that in interesting and there is little information provided. You have to pay extra for the camera obscura, which seems a bit mean after paying so much for the entry fee - and you get to see the views anyway. So, not quite sure why so many people were queuing to visit it. There are a couple of restaurants/cafes inside, which makes me think that that's the main attraction, rather than the actual fort itself. Some of the surfaces are uneven and there are some steep stairs up to the ramparts in places. The easiest way up to it is to catch the lift that takes you up several floors from the ground level to near the fort level. It saves on the feet and is worth it to avoid endless uphill walks. So, worth it for the views, but the price is still a bit much for what you get."

A great place to immerse yourself in real history with the romantic gardens being a delight; the shade of the trees and breeze from the river really calming. I think it is in the process of having exhibitions added with some of the newer cases looking very much like the exhibitions in Pompeii. The views from the castle walls are very impressive but walking around the castle should be the main reason for visiting."

That said, the place itself is only mildly interesting-- a collection of rambling old ruins. It would be purgatorial on a hot day, because you have to squeeze your way through crowds of people all trying to make their way up and down narrow walkways. I visited it as part of a walk through the historic district, going up the stone steps from Praca da Figuera (the nearest square) and then wandering back down through the Alfama (picturesque neighborhood preserving many features from before the 1755 earthquake), and this made the whole experience much of a real adventure. But there are many, many, many steps, and the signage is poor (I got lost a couple of times and had to reorient), so doing it this way is not for the faint of heart (or lung)."

Its a very small bus, looks like a transit van! The entrance fee is 8.50 Euros for an adult. Views are really good, you can see all Lisbon from here. But there is nothing else to see there.

We spent the morning fairly sedentary as we explored Belem via a hop on/hop off bus, so we were more than willing to explore our way up to the castle on foot and were pleased to have done it that way. We stopped midway up the hill at a church for a shot of Ginjinha/lemonade, stopped a bit further up to look at the view where weary travellers soaked their feet in a public wading pool, and then meandered slowly toward the hilltop for the castle.As others have noted, there were peacocks on the grounds, including a blue and white one that I'd never seen before. We were most inspired by the views and our ability to walk around the ruins of the castle. It wasn't as impressive as the Castelo dos Mouros in Sintra, but we hadn't been there yet, so we enjoyed our first Portuguese castle experience including our trip up the hillside and walkabout. We have since heard that they had a great selection of wines at the cafe, but didn't stop for such items inside the site. At 8 euros, this was a fee well worth paying from our perspective."

Lines to get in and you do have to walk up hill to get there but there several ways to avoid a lengthy walk and steep inclines, including a free elevator ride. People think it is a castle but it doesn't look close to what most people envision when they hear the word castle. You have to remember Lisbon was almost demolished in the earthquake of 1755 so they don't have many original structures still around. There are 3 main attractions inside. 1. The periscope which takes 20 people every 30 minutes. They alternate languages so the first one is in Portuguese, the second in English, and third in Spanish (maybe not that order but if you miss your language you have to wait through two other 30 minute cycles to get it again). 2. The ruins - they have Iron Age, Moors, and Medieval periods. Note these ruins are outlines of buildings but they are decent outlines and the Moors area has some mosaic tiles still visible. 3. The museum which houses all the artifacts they found in the castle area. The cafe is nice and not overpriced and you can have a light snack and watch lots of peacocks. They have a wine cart so you can sip on wine and enjoy the sight."

The castle is essentially a ruin with only the battlements and walls still standing. The museum is interesting, showing the pieces that have been recovered with archaeological digs. The archaeological site itself I thought was poor. Since it is now 14 years since they finished digging, I thought there could have been a lot more effort put into interpretation. It has a remarkable history that needs more interpretative material"

A continuing theme in Lisbon is that signage is very poor. This resulted in us climbing and walking more than we needed to to reach the castle. Again, we used our Lisboa Cards and got discount on entry, paying 13 euro for the two of us.The views over the city were very good, but there is little else of interest in the castle. You can get views as good from other places for free. There is small museum, but it has nothing 'wow' in it.There is a camera obscure in one of the towers, but with absolutely no signage telling you how to get to it. We assumed in the end that you had to climb up the battlements and walk round. Not good if one of your party is unsteady and suffers from vertigo, especially as it was very windy. So, we gave that a miss. The highlight for me was the very good coffee and excellent custard tarts sold in the cafe."

As I seem to find in alot of Lisbon attractions, the information and history of these places are steeped with many twists and turns but unless you hire a tour guide, you don't really learn much onsite. I would recommend looking up the history of this lovely old castle before you visit if you're not going to shell out for a guide. We walked up through the Alfama neighbourhood which is no mean feat I can tell you! By the time we got to the Castle (the 2nd time around - please note, its closed on Mondays!), we were pretty tired already but we didnt have to queue for long. The grounds are well kept and beautifully laid out, don't forget your camera as there are some amazing views of Lisbon and the 25 de Abril Bridge to be had.You can climb up the battlements and wander around amongst the snapping Portuguese flags in the wind and look down on all of Lisboa - please note, if you don't have a good head for heights then you may not like the upper levels where the Camera Obscura is. The cafe onsite is a bit costly for lunch but the staff were very friendly. Do sit outside and enjoy the calls of the many peacocks that like to roam and show off their feathers! You can also get a nice glass of vino for a decent price and sit in one of the many alcoves and benches that nestle along the lower levels of the castle view. Do go and enjoy :)"

The beauty of Sao Jorge castle is that it is in its authentic rustic state. Once entering the castle grounds, you are free to wander as you like, and when I went (about 6pm in the evening) there were hardly any crowds, so you get a personal experience. As someone who loves history, I really enjoyed walking along the walls and fortifications, trying to imagine their stories.A bonus - the peacocks! When I first arrived there was a peacock on full display who seemed to be used to guests, as he twirled around and around showing us his plumage for about ten minutes!There are also stray cats, which is a plus or minus depending on what sort of person you are. I love cats, so I found it a charming touch. Even if you don't like them though, they keep to themselves.The views of the city are also sensational.In a city like Lisbon that's often teeming with tourists, I found the castle to be my most private & memorable experience. An absolute must-visit, I'd say."

Perhaps it was my mood or that I was tired but other than the incredible views and the \"castle\" look to this place, frankly, I found it a bit boring. I was not in the \"use my imagination\" mode to picture the past from the remaining rocks and walls. Yes, the intact parts are fascinating and it's great to be able to walk around up top like a soldier of the past, preparing to fire my weapon from atop the castle walls. After a while it was all rocks and rubble! I suppose it is an important part of Lisbon history so you MUST visit for that reason. If I only had one day in Lisbon I would not spend too much time here."

You should spend at least 1 hour to walk around and see all the vistas of Lisbon. The stairs steps to take you to the upper walkway to see the castle turrets and are much steeper than standard steps. They can be difficult to navigate for those less physically inclined. There are handrails though that help a lot. The entrance fee in April 2015 was only 8.50 Euros."

We were let out at Santa Luzia viewpoint and then a short walk to the castle. We had wonderful views of Lisbon from every angle. But one of the highlights were the cheeky peacocks that took turns in the square being photographed. They would each in turn strut and display their feathers and slowly circle while all the cameras clicked. They were very entertaining. Also there is a lovely cafe and wine kiosk. Very relaxing. If you don't want to climb the ramparts it is still and enjoyable and scenic visit. Not to be missed."

Following our Easter Sunday mega meal of boiled offal, we made our way up what seemed like innumerable stone stairs that ran behind many a home and finally to the castle, after a very necessary short stop for a super mojito.The castle is one of a few places open on a Easter Sunday.Yes, worth the effort, splendid views, reminded me of some of the castles in Andalusia, Spain, well it would be as all built by the Moors centuries ago.We did discover that you could take a bus from the cathedral to the base of the castle, we did use the bus on the way back and that's another story. Man its a bone shaker due to the cobbled streets. I think taking the hard route is far more interesting, plenty of \"is this the way to the castle\". Amazing that this was built so high up so long ago.Well the castle is largely a ruin, with some walls intact, later additions such as cannon in place. Sound of peacocks but none seen, wonder if it was a tape being played over some loudspeakers?There is restaurant and another for snacks and drinks, toilet not an issue. Go see it."

My best memory was of the amazing peacocks which roamed around, they were huge and so colourful, it does get very busy with tourist parties.

The best part about the castle is that it occupies the highest point of the Lisbon city area, so you can have really good views of the different structures in the city and Tagus river. Outside of that, I really don't see much else to see in this castle considering that the royal palace is supposed to be here. There is supposed a royal palace in the form of archaeology ruins there, but it's very small and not much to see. The permanent exhibition does not really show that much and the castle itself just has some walls. If I had seen this without reading their guide, I would've thought it was just the castle of a Portuguese knight that fell into ruins over time."

The strongly fortified citadel dates from medieval period of Portuguese history. While various cultures occupied this site, it is my understanding that the fortifications were rebuilt by the Berbers in the 10th century. Then between 1373 and 1375, the a walled compound enclosing the castle was built by Jo\u00e3o Fernandes and Vasco Br\u00e1s, thus replacing the Moorish walls. The castle and the city resisted the forces of Castile several times during the 14th century. Later, it was a royal palace. It was the site of a reception by King Manuel I for Vasco da Gama when he returned from discovering the maritime route to India in 1498. The 1755 Lisbon earthquake severely damaged the castle, but many of the walls are still standing.You can walk around the top of the fortified walls, and the views of the city and water are fabulous; best view of Lisbon! The museum is also worth spending some time in; there is a sizeable collection of Moorish pottery sherds, coins and other items."

The museum entrance is very informative and discusses a history of the city of Lisbon and the founding of Portugal, and then the castle is a fun place to roam around. The castle walls are accessible via some very narrow, slippery, uneven staircases, so be very careful! There are also some excellent views from the various corners of the walls.

Castelo Sao Jorge is situated on the tallest of the seven hills of Lisbon and gives you great views of the Tagus River, Alfama, and other sections of Lisbon. It's a must see. For those of you expecting a completely medieval experience understand that this is a partially restored castle. Most of it was level in the massive earthquake of 1755 which destroyed large portions of the city. So you are visiting a ruin rather than a fully functioning medieval castle. That said, it's still worth visiting for the views and for what's still there. You can walk along the castle walls and ramparts. There is a small museum to visit that shows some of it's history.  If you like history then you will especially like the excavations. Those excavations show remains of iron age, moorish, early Portugal, and later Portugal. It gives you a great understanding of how long Portugal has been around and it's continual habitation. Getting there you can take a trolley or bus. The trolley will still leave you with a walk though. We took the trolley up but then took a taxi to our next destination. Taxis do make sense if you have 3-4 people."

Be sure to wear comfortable shoes. Go early or later in the day to avoid the tour group crowds. There's a camera obscura in one of the towers with demos for groups of 20 at a time every 30 minutes. The language used for each session alternates (English, Spanish, Portuguese), so pick the right one, and line up 20-30 mins beforehand to grab a spot. Interesting way to see the city and hear about the sights. Only lasts for 15 minutes though, so may not be worth it if your time is limited. You might spend more time waiting if there's a crowd!"

The walk to the castle is a beauty in itself, taking into account you actually get to see the beautiful streets curving upwards towards the castle providing a really portuguese feel with its traditional housing.Inside the castle you can climb onto the upper floors and see what proves to be another amazing view providing a small glimpse into the houses packed with flowers down below.The photos speak for themselves.

There was space in the security gate to leave our pushchair and I don't recommend taking it around the castle; the cobbled floors would be difficult for even the largest of pushchair wheels. Straight through the main entrance you're welcomed with beautiful views across Lisbon. The castle grounds are completely open and you can walk right around the castle walls and towers; we all really enjoyed it. At the back of the grounds there is a small archaeology site showing you the foundations from the 7th-3rd century AD; something we again enjoyed. There are many peacocks near the cafe and museum, all of which seamed eager to show off their tail feathers and kept our daughter smiling. Once we'd finished we took a walk through the old streets of Alfama back to the city. We'd definitely recommend this attraction when visiting Lisbon."

To get there we used the old trolly busses, which are a great way to travel and a thrill ride to boot. 6 euro will get you a pass for Metro, buses and trams (purchase at Metro stations). The tram was number 28 and we squeezed on like compressed sardines; there seems to be no rules as to how many people can be crammed in to a very small space. Word of warning, the tram windows are open in warm weather and if you stick your head out you might get it chopped off as the trolly busses go very close to walls and we passed scaffolding which was literally inches away; scary thought. Take a best guess which stop to get off at as no one tells you and it's not obvious. The first day we went we never even found the Castle and ended up on the opposite valley. When the trolley bus arrives at an open area overlooking the bay, you have arrived; intact you have gone one stop too far. Walk back around the corner and start your accent to the Castle. It cost about 16 euro to get in and the kids were free. The first thing to note is you are walking on very uneven ground and very slippy if it's wet so be careful. Secondly, beware when you go to look at the magnificent views over Lisbon, the wall is very easy for kids to climb up on and there is a sheer drop of 30 ft + on the other side. There is a restaurant in the grounds or a cafe for lighter bites. The facilities are pretty good. When you enter the castle and climb up on to the ramparts there are no safety rails and again the danger to children is sever, make sure you supervise them at all times. The views are again worth the climb although the steps are overcrowded and there is no system for going up or coming down so people squeeze past each other. There is a museum inside the grounds and all in all it is a great castle to explore. One thing though the Portuguese are not very good at exploiting this asset and there are few explanations of various parts of the castle as you travel round."

There is an archaelogical museum and an archaeological site (which can be reached by precipitous stone steps). The restaurant is set in well-tended formal gardens where large numbers of peacocks and peahens mingle among the cafe users outside. They perch high up in trees above the tables - so watch out!

We took the shortest route to the Castelo from the Santa Justa Elevador, straight down the Rua de Santa Justa, straight across the Rua da Madalena, up some steps passing some incredibly good street art (graffiti), passed a little un-named cafe (really good coffee at half the price of anywhere else), round a church and up a winding street (follow the sign). By the time we arrived there was a 30 minute queue(it can be much longer apparently) but we were entertained by a living statue near the entrance. Admission is around 7 Euros but you do get a free guide book to help you plan your route around the castle and grounds. The surfaces are, as to be expected, a little uneven so watch your footing, but there are some delightful vistas, spectacular viewpoints and shady calm areas. If you have children, keep an eye on them as the walls are not high and you could lose them over the edge. I wouldn't advise you taking them up on the parapets either as the steps up are very steep, narrow and have only a single rail to hang on to. I don't want to put anyone off visiting here though as the whole place has a magical calmness and there are plenty of areas that are safe for children. The peacocks hang around the cafe at the centre of the castle and are always good for a show, either on the ground or up in the trees. The loos are down a flight of steps which might prove difficult for some and the shop is very small and has a very limited stock. Attached to the castle is an archeological dig, which you can access via another parapet and steep stairs (gulp) and right on the top is a camera obscura (again they might be queues to get in this bit). Find the right spot, out of the breeze and you could spend a good few hours here."

Once you walk through the main entrance gate, you are greeted into a large courtyard area that branches out to provide spectacular views (on your left and straight ahead). Be cautious of the walkway as it is uneven cobble stones that I saw several people trip on. The roots from the trees have also called uneven surfaces to walk on. The courtyard as you enter is shaded under sprawling trees and is a nice place to relax before and or after you enter the castle walls. The views of the city of Lisbon as it is nestled against the Tajo (ocean straight) are sights you won\u2019t soon forget. As you stroll further into the heart of this walled city / castle, you\u2019ll be in awe of the city that spans over the rolling hills all around you. Panoramic views of the city are best from here \u2013 a top some of the castle walls. Once you enter into the courtyard within the castle itself, go ahead and climb the narrow, steep, worn steps to the top of the walls. You can make a full circle around the castle by walking atop the walls \u2013 you will also gain some of the most spectacular views surrounding Lisbon. There are many unique architectural features built into the castle as well \u2013 so explore the upper walls. Once you return down the steps from atop of the walls, stroll over to the courtyard that is lavish and has the restaurant tucked away within it. Look in the trees \u2013 there are Peacocks all around and you will be able to hear them. On the right, just passed the cafeteria, is an entrance to the museum \u2013 worth the walk through as they provide timelines, artifacts and additional information about the castle, city of Lisbon and its history. A few suggestions and or helpful hints:* Tickets are 8.50 euro* Tram #28 will get you to the drop off point to take a short walk up to the castle. This rickety, old romantic type trolley car will whisk you by various sites of Lisbon and the bustling beat and vibe of the city. * Get the daily pass card (6 euro at any M or metro station), this allows you 24 hour unlimited access to all the trams. * Pack a lunch \u2013 there are a few restaurants prior to going in you can get a snack at and or bring your own. * They do have a mini wine truck on premise \u2013 but it is not always open* Don\u2019t let kids wonder free a top the castle walls. The stairs will provide you with a warning. The top of the castle walls have open railing and not the best for kids \u201crunning\u201d around. * You can get a \u201ctuk\u201d and or a cab directly to the ticket office if you\u2019re not wanting to subject yourself to the semi steep, short walk. A \u201ctuk\u201d is basically a 3 wheeled motor cycled that is enclosed and or a convertible in some cases. They are quite common all around Lisbon."

Located in a walled area, entrance is via barcoded ticket purchased at the ticket office nearby. Look out for the Moorish \u2018living statue\u2019 who can certainly help the time pass whilst queuing.The views from the very top of the castle battlements are well worth the effort climbing the steps, but the walkways are narrow and in some places the railings are quite low \u2013 probably wouldn\u2019t pass the UK Health & Safety police!Although sunny on the day we visited, there was quite a breeze, so be prepared for a chill if you spend a long time walking around the upper paths. There is a self-service caf\u00e9 located in the grounds which has a range of snacks and sandwiches \u2013 nothing fancy but you can at least sit outside among the many peacocks whilst taking a quick break.We felt both the castle and the archaeological dig area could benefit from much more information \u2013 there were few plaques and only minimal information in the printed guide. Perhaps a guided audio tour would be something the tourist office could consider.After a couple of hours walking around the castle, wander back down the winding hilly streets, taking in the sights and sounds of historic Lisbon and Alfama."

The views from the castle are great as you can see the whole city, but the castle itself was not very interesting and I think the fee is quite high (8,5 EUR per adult). There aren't explanations of the parts of the castle, so we just wandered and didn't learn anything new. I have been in other medieval castles where -even if you don't pay extras- you can find little posters with info about its past, but nothing in this one.

Within the walls there is plenty of shade from the summer sun under a canopy of trees but all the viewing points are magnificent, looking out across the city in every direction. You can walk on virtually all the rampart walls and climb most of the towers, including one which has a camera obscura exhibit - well worth a look.

If you have a spare 2 hours go for it,it was worth way more than price of 8,5 euro we paid. I highly recommend if you enjoy nature, great views and walk around trees, also of course if you enjoy castles. I choose to go there around 5 o'clock as I knew sunset will be about 6:40 and I advice you do the same. Beautiful view and colours, something that is truly magnificent :). When we get out all taxis were gone, but fortunately that was some bus and for 2.3 euro we get to square next to Rossio in 8 minutes, great value."

We were also lucky enough to see the images afforded by the Camera Obscura which was invented by Leonardo da Vinci. Unfortunately the weather was overcast at the time which meant that the images were not as clear as they might have been but it was still very interesting. It was just a shame that the commentary was in Portuguese only but to be fair the tour guide could hardly be expected to translate everything into different languages."

Yes, the Castle itself is not the most interesting that I have visited - although there are interesting archaeological excavations to one side, and arches which formed part of a past royal palace to another - but the view of the City and the Rio Tejo estuary and bridge are why to go. We went during a late afternoon and watched the sun descend towards the horizon, fuelled by a glass of wine that an enterprising trader sold from a well-equipped tuk-tuk, parked within the Castle.I believe that this is the best view of Lisbon from the land. Pick a good day and just soak up being there."

The walk up the hill seemed a bit strenuous, so we walked down towards Commercio and caught a tuk-tuk to the entrance. Our driver provided some security advice (put your head as well as your arm through shoulder bag straps, and carry the bag at the front not the back), and we were off. The ticket office is a ways down the road from the entrance, but the guards at the gate lose no opportunity to tell you where to go.The entrance area inside the castle is nicely shaded, with a small drinks kiosk if you need it, and a loo up some steps. The castle itself is easy to walk around being all pretty much on one level, and there is a nice shady museum and a cafeteria where you can get baguettes and soft drinks and sit outside. The central keep doesn't have much going on inside, but for completeness you should explore every yard in there. There was an archaeological dig going on next door, which could be reached by a rather precarious set of steps that my wife baulked at. There is also no way out other than to come back the way you went in, so if you don't have a desire to walk down, and then back up, 30 feet of stone steps with no guard rail, give that bit a miss.Other than that, its a very pleasant way to spend an afternoon. The main battlements have been largely levelled, so the main walkway looks directly out over the Alfama, Baixa and Bairro Alto, with terrific views. Seats and tables for you to enjoy a refreshing drink make it very restful.The walk back was downhill, so we used shanks pony. About half-way down we found a large restaurant with an elevadore on Costa do Castelo, which eliminated a lot of walking and brought us back to ground level about 10 minutes after leaving the castle."

Hopefully this tip will help other TA readers avoid a long wait.......until the tip becomes more widely known anyway! Alfama is an amazing warren. Having left the tram we wandered about in the maze until we paused for coffee and Pasteis at Palazo de Belmonte, in lovely sun trap courtyard. 2 coffees 2 Pasteis \u20ac8, a bit steep, but a nice location. We thought the Castle was well worth it. Fantastic views over Lisbon and the river and the views really are better from inside the castle than outside. There are lots of ramparts to explore. Also, you get a reduced entry fee if you have a Lisboa Card (which in turn gives you FREE entry to the Monestary Jeronimos, so it seems that in Lisbon you really can have your cake and eat it).

For me its the views and being within old castle walls, but there is a restaurant and small shops about.

We went to the Moorish Castle In Sentra outside Lusbon and thought the Sao George Castle might be a let down but the view of Lisbon and the water at Sao George was worth the 14 Euro entrance fee. We thought we'd take tram 28 up the hill but it was so crowded we paid a few Euro and zipped up to the castle in a taxi. There was a guitar guy singing near the entrance and a beautiful arch and orange trees and the wait at the ticket office zipped by. The most mesmerizing view of church domes and red roofs greets you at the entrance. There are old Portuguese cannons and ruins and it's s joy to wander up and down stairs, over motes, seeing castle remains. We spent two hours at Sao George, including eating lunch and watching the peacocks. Just a lovely way to spend our last day in Portugal. We walked into town and admired the tiled apartment fronts and poked into stores and caught tram 28 down which was a lot less crowded. Great way to spend a quiet a relaxing afternoon."

Still, once you are there, buy a ticket and enter. The grounds, towers, walkways and views are well worth the walk up and the admission.

I'll be honest, I'm not a fan of history, however the castle is at the top of a hill and we imagined the views would be fantastic. We weren't wrong! Abeit a little chilly, the sun was shining and you could sit on the castle wall and look across the city. Much to our surprise, there was also wine for sale from a small Tuk Tuk van within the grounds. What more could we ask for, sitting in the sun for 3 hours, overlooking the city, putting the world to rights after 3 bottles of wine then a short trip back to the bottom on a bright pink Tuk Tuk!! Oh and the small part of the castle that we did actually see was stunning. Would recommend this on a nice day, wouldn't recommend if it was cold and raining, wouldn't have the same atmosphere and the views just wouldn't be the same."

(From the elevator, the arc the rua agusta, if you are ok with paying a small sum (2.5\u20ac/with metrocard) or from Bairro Alto, wich is for free. Apart from the view, its a ruin, with not much to see. There is a museum with old artifacts, so if you like that, go. There is a studentfee, 5\u20ac, that is not on the list at the entrance. If you walk up the hill, witch is not that challenging, there are many cozy caf\u00e9s and restaurants. One in a small square, as you walk straight down from the entrance. SO, as you see, many more interessting things to do than the castle, I would say."

There's really not much to see in the 'castle' itself its basically a fort you take a walk around that has some trees, nice shrubbery and peacocks. If you want to see some great views and take some pictures - visiting here is one area to get them! Personally I felt it was over priced and overrated."

There were moments when my friend and I were the only ones in the open square or on that particular section of the castle wall. For 8,50 Euro, it was a great place to visit - the views are amazing. You can see out to the river and into the city. You sit and people watch, sketch, or watch people sketching. Kids can run around playing \"owner of the keep\" (and there was some kindof medieval experience for kids program-type thing going on when we were there). If you're planning on walking on the top of the wall, make sure to wear rubber-soled shoes because it is a bit slippery. To get to the castle, you can follow the tram line up and wander up from the main square. Or you can hop on the tram 28 which will drop you off nearby."

We were glad to to have sturdy walking shoes for the steep cobbled streets in the light rain on the way up to the castle. Once in the castle, we felt transported back in time while exploring the castle walls and battlements. The bonus was the view of Lisbon in the fog, especially as the city started to light up in the evening - just beautiful. This attraction was well worth it, and we wish we had more time to go through the displays thoroughly to learn more about the history behind the artifacts found in the castle and surrounding areas.FYI: There are very clean bathroom facilities by the display area."

Pros - DRAMATIC VIEWS OF bridge, Targus River (in distance) and most of city (Baixa especially closeup) from massive and extensive stone extension walls, ramparts and turrets. Its huge so u can spend a lot of time (2-3 hours) walking round.CONS - pretty bare as most of it destroyed in 1755 quake, never fully restored.Where: Rua de Santa Cruz do Castelo, Lisbon 1100-129, at top of a hill above Alfama and Baixa - Walk up from Baixa or Alfma, or bus 37 from Rossio.When: Daily 9AM-9PM (March-Oct.), 9AM-6PM (Nov.-Feb.) Please check opening times! Okay I went cos the thing was visible and calling to me from almost everywhere in the city. My busy cooking school schedule left little time or money but had to do this along with Belem. No regrets as an avid photographer (bring a wide angle lens for the most views of a pretty city compared to even the many hillside terraces (\"miradouros\")).You'll get a distant look at the Targus River, the graceful 25 de Abril Bridge and closeups of red roofs (and washing lines with clothes blowing in the wind) of Baixa. (checkout fotos) BTW - I walked rapidly up from Figueira Square in Baixa as it looked close, but it was still a steep hike of 25 minutes so be warned if u have a heavy backpack! You could take Santa Justa elevator in Baixa to cut down walk. But it left a lot to be desired in terms of feeling the history and how it functioned as a place to live in - not much besides the stony walls. Wouldn't recommend for very young kids. (Comparatively, Castel de Moros in Sintra is even more of a ruin but SOOO dramatic on hillside that recommend that 100percent) There's small museum that gives the bare bones (pun intended) as there are bones of pigs, sheep, horse and cows reared and obviously eaten by inhabitants thru the ages, relics (good collection of ancient kitchen equipment), tiles and assortment of weaponry but all too briefly explained. Pity, as the Celtic and Iberian tribes as well as the Romans, the Visigoths and the Moors populated the hill it sits on. The oldest parts of the Castle proper dates back to 6th century, built as a residence then fortress by the Moors who lived there til booted out by Portugal\u2019s first king, Afonso Henriques aided by crusaders as part of the Seige of Lisbon in 1147.Maybe it would've been more fun in the summer where there are supposed to be festivals in the massive courtyards. Still, tons of ramparts to climb up for varying views of the city - Just be very careful as many are not railing-ed, keep your eye on the kids! Tip1 - After visit, if you walk SouthEast (turn left at gates toward Alfama instead of right to get back down Baixa/elevator) there's an EXCELLENT, cool self guided, but a bit grungy, historical walk you can find on http://www.lisbonlux.com/lisbon/alfama-walking-tour.htmlTip2- Oops, nearly forgot the gorgeous peacocks which let u get close if u move slooooowly. Check out the photos.Tip 3-Theres also a small restaurant in the middle that looked open but empty of customers during lunch in the winter. Lots of little cool cafes just outside walls as alternatives that are a bit tourist-trappy, the better ones are nearer to downtown Baixa."

After that, surely you have to climb. A little more effort and you will be in touch with nice ways all around the castle and the most beautifull landscapes. Stop and take thousands of pictures to the various Lisbon hills, to the river, to the Cathedral (S\u00e9) to dowtown, and again to the river. See the reflections of the sun on the houses and on the river. Take proffit of one of the most beautiful sunsets you ever see. On coming down. stop at Miradouro of Santa Luzia, and see the views over Alfama. Then go down the stairs and walk around in the narrow streets of Alfama, having some wine, sardine (when it\u00b4s the time) and listen to Fado. What more shall you need?"

Interesting: the old Muslim fortress still shows impressive remnants, whereas the royal palace that nearly replaced it was destroyed by the earthquake of the 18th century and later transformed into barracks. After having visited the place, walk down across the Alfama district to the river: you'll enjoy to discover other aspects of Lisbon!"

A full day ticket on trams and Metro costs 6.50 euro so you can then use this to go to Belum or the aquarium which are the further away tourist spots. The castle entrance fee was 7.50 Euro, short queue for us but if it were longer we saw a machine for tickets by the entrance turnstiles, could try there. It's an impressive castle with nice views of the city and the river, you can walk around the battlements in places, some of these have low guard rails so watch out if you have small children. There is an archaeological site with parts dated back to the roman era and a museum area with (some) artefacts that have been extracted from the site. It didn't have any reconstruction of castle life or armour etc that you might see in some castles so it was more of a nice interesting walk on a sunny day."

The castle does have a fee to enter and it is worth it if you also take a guided tour and then explore on your own. You need to remember that the Castle has served various purposes over the years so sometimes you are seeing a version of the castle that has been restored. The archeological sites that from the Roman and Moslem periods are very interesting. The museum is one that you can explore on your own and is sufficient for some one who enjoys the many items to spend more time than a quick run through to get a quick overview. All in all it is worth the time and climb if you walk up the hill to it. I recommend the walk up for the views and feel for Lisbon and the neighborhood around the Castle."

We were sailing past the 25th April bridge (which looks like San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge) it's called this after the 1974 Revolution and is the second largest suspension bridge in Europe. We pass the towering Christ the Redeemer statue ( a mini Rio de Janeiro statue) this statue was funded by the women of Portugul in thanksgiving their men were not actively involved in WWII.What an absolute magnificent view to open your curtains in the morning. We disembarked Santa Apolonia port in the Alfama region, the ancient Moorish area and walked along the sea front and entered the rather Grand 18th century Praco do Comercio ( commercial square), three of its sides are enclosed by noble buildings, classical in style with tall arcades supporting two upper storeys. King Carlos and his eldest son were assassinated here in 1908. This square overlooks the river Tagus, it's very picturesque. We walked up to the Main Street in the Baixa (pronounced Biatha) region to Rossio square which is the main plaza. We spotted the elevator Santa Justa ( mini Eiffel Tower) but walked up the steep labyrinth of streets to the ten towered Castelo de S\u00e3o Jorge. Built in 10th century then expanded into a Royal Palace 13th - 16th century. It has commanding panoramic views over Lisbon. We spent several hours here and were worn out. It has a romantic garden, museum which displays artefacts collected on site from Romans to the Moors. Well worth the \u20ac8.50 entrance fee. The camera obscura was fabulous giving a 360 view around Lisbon. This uses mirrors and convex lenses to bring Lisbon up close and personal. Rain and cloud spoil the images.Peacocks roam freely around the castle gardens with the odd feral cat and is surrounded by native trees. A splendid time spent here. On exit we wandered and discovered a sun filled terraced bar which has magnificent views over river Tagus and enjoyed a cooling beer and free wifi to catch up. We walked back down the winding cobbled streets passing Lisbon Cathedral and popping into the odd shop. The Azulejos or coloured painted tiles are a master craft here and very expensive. The tiles fit together to display great scenes, geometric or abstract patterns. Buildings, churches, town halls and railways are lovingly adorned with Azulejos. A lot of shops were closed as it's Sunday but all the restaurants are open and full of families enjoying time together."

I recommend getting there early to avoid the tourist coaches and inevitable queue for entry tickets. Taking the 28 tram is a good way to see some sights, but beware the pickpockets.

This took around 10-15 minutes going uphill and passes the Se Cathedral on the way. The alternative is to walk, take the number 28 tram or take one of the many Tuk-Tuks.At the ticket office, we used our LisbaoCard to get a discount of 20% on the 8.50\u20ac adult ticket.Once in the castle grounds after showing our tickets we were in the Observation Terrace and from here we could look down at the city.Inside the perimeter of the castle walls, it\u2019s an open area. There is access to the top of the walls (around 10 metres high) via stairs but I\u2019m not very fond of heights so we stays on the ground level. There are stair barriers but it looks like there is no protection once at the top walking level and this seems to be very dangerous. Unfortunately, the Archaeological Site could only be accessed by walking along the wall as the road was closed and we felt we missed out on our visit.There is a Permanent Exhibition showing objects found in the Archaeological Site.The castle cafe sells cakes and drinks. We sat inside for lunch but there are outside tables and people were watching the peacocks come and go.We spent around half-a-day there and rather than taking the bus, we walked down and stopped at the Se Cathedral before ending up at the Praca do Comercio looking up at the castle."

Recommend shortcuts mentioned in travel books unless you are looking forward to a lot of elevation walking.The grounds around the castle are worth a stroll. Charming and nice views. The castle itself is basically the castle walls which you can reach via steps in many areas. Provides nice views of the open areas below as well as the area outside of the castle. There also are some ruins and foundations but not much else. Overall it was interesting enough to keep us exploring for a couple of hours. Do recommend the visit but do not expect to see rooms in the castle. If you have difficulty with stairs or feel uncomfortable with heights then it might not be something you would enjoy.Otherwise enjoy your visit."

Inside you do get a problem with queues for tickets (if you just want a guidebook don't be afraid to go through the line and get one). Costs \u20ac8.50 per person to get entry to the castle grounds, thought this a bit expensive at first but then remembered how much it is to get in some castles in the UK! There is quite a lot to see within, a wonderful miradoura (viewing balcony), canons to climb over (if so inclined), walls to walk, cubby holes to squeeze into, peacocks strolling around, birds of prey, with cafes and shops within the walls too. There's also an archaeological dig area to the rear worth a visit whilst there are fabulous views from pretty much every part of the place. And it's all downhill when you've finished!"

All good reasons to visit this attraction. However the best reason to visit is for the guided tour given by Bruno.

It is on the Tram 28 route (if you can get on it), has a commanding view over Lisbon and is very well preserved and/or restored. In the castle keep is an exhibit of live birds of prey (eagles, falcons, owls, etc.) which is interesting. On the battlements is a small wagon serving Portuguese wines by the bottle or the glass which you can wander the grounds with, though it is not such a good idea to be navigating the steep stairs up to the towers after a few glasses."

Surprised how many negative reviews there are - we just went with our two kids (6 and 10) and we all enjoyed it and think it was one of the highlights of our trip. Yes, it's 8.50 entrance for adults but the kids were free. Everything in Europe costs this much (or more) so surprised by the grumbling.We took the bus up and it was brilliant - got on at the terminus and we all had a seat; it let's off right outside the castle. I had heard the tram 28 was a bit circuitous, crowded, and full of pickpockets so we avoided it. We got there on Sunday morning around 10:30 and there was a short line for tickets. The views and scenery were amazing; we spent a long time walking along the edges and taking photos. When we finally got up to the castle and the ruins we again spent a long time - everywhere you look is a beautiful view and picture!One thing for parents of young kids - we found it very difficult walking on the ground because of uneven tiles and walkways and were quite nervous walking up on the castle walls/staircases with the kids. We held their hands and went slowly and were glad it wasn't crowded.The inside museum part was small but worth a peek; we saw dancers in period costumes at the entrance, which the kids enjoyed. We also thought the shop at the exit was quite nice and had some unique things unlike what we've seen in other tourist shops.We also walked down rough the Alfama and took in more spectacular views. Can't imagine walking up but the walk down was really nice - we went via the cathedral (Se) which I think is more impressive from the outside and age at a really cute restaurant that I would write up for TA except they didn't have business cards and there was no name on the street!

We asked for the stop location and a local pointed the direction and said for us to look for a large crowd gathering. We joined the queue and managed to get on the second tram that passed. Ask the driver to tell you which stop to alight off the tram to reach the castle. Its entrance is not visible although it is a short distance from the stop. Buy a day ticket before using the public transport system. It costs 6 Euros, but each metro trip is 1.40 and the tram costs 2.85 when boarded (and they only take coins).Entrance to the Castle is 8,50 Euros. The castle grounds are quite ample, and almost all parts are accessible, including the walls. A good view of the city bellow and also of the surrounding neighbourhood. The castle includes a birds of prey exhibition, a museum with artifacts excavated and an excavation site remnants from the iron-age, Muslim and Christian occupations.Catch the same tram on the opposite side of the road to return to the metro station."

Even the excavated archaeological site was pretty interesting. We did not take a tour but wished we had. I was surprised that the castle had a decent setup with facilities and food. By the cafe area there were a group of peacocks walking around and they will come right up to you looking for food like they were pigeons. The line to purchase admission tickets will appear long but don't get discouraged as it moves fairly quickly.We enjoyed the walk up to the castle from the center of the city then walked down through the narrow streets of Alfama. Although all uphill, the walk to the castle is not bad at all. Some were even pushing strollers.

Its is indeed one of my favorites spots in LIsbon and I keep going and going. The views from its ramparts and belvederes are amazing: the city and its river - Lisbon and the Tejo, inseparable. The castle has ever been there, being built by the moors (around the 11th century) and later on converted in the royal palace of the new Portuguese Kingdom. D. Afonso Henriques renovated the moorish castle and the Portuguese court got its new royal palace. \"Castelo de S\u00e3o Jorge\" is named after St. George, patron of knights and crusaders and a martyr much praised and worshiped in the Medieval Ages (and up to our days, of course). The castle had its golden years between the 12th and 16th centuries. Later on, it was converted into military quarters. In the years 1940, its ruins were totally renovated, acquiring the actual looks. Since 1910, the \"Castelo de S\u00e3o Jorge\" is a Portuguese National Monument and visiting it is a total must. I enjoy seating on a quite corner watching the beautiful views, relaxing and looking for some inner reflection moments in such peaceful environment. Two last remarks: 1) the castle is on the top of a hill, if you have any kind of locomotion problems, take a taxi up to the castle's gates at Rua de Santa Cruz do Castelo; 2) entrance fee is around E$ 8,50 per person - check if you are entitled for any kind of reduction, as senior citizens (over 65) pay only E$ 5,00.

We took a taxi to get there early ( 10 am ) very few people but by noon the queues were very long .Wonderful layers of history and a fairytale castle in the centre .Hard to describe , within the walls there is a small town , then you pay to access the inner walls and then the actual castle is within that again .breathtaking views and its great to walk down the hills through the cobblestone streets .Would like to go back to see the dawn or ( more likely ) sunset ."

The castle was good for us. We liked walking around and exploring it was our second castle and we very much enjoyed it. There was also an archeological dig as part of the tour. By going early we did miss out on other activities they have later in the day."

At the point where we were already soaked to the skin that it didn't matter, we continued with our tour of this castle. I would love to go back here on a dry day because this was a lovely castle with great grounds to visit. We ended up on a rushed tour as the castle is on a hill that slopes towards Lisbon, and most of the castle grounds were almost a river as we walked through, those areas that were flat were fast becoming a swimming pool. This is an old castle and the rain we had was incredibly heavy that made the old stairs difficult to climb up as there was water pouring down from the top. We still walked to the top to see what views we could see, and had it been cleared, it would have been worth the trip for a photo stop alone. If I'm in Lisbon again, then I will definitely go and do this on a dry day so that I can appreciate it more."

They had a birds of prey show as well, which for a few extra bucks you could \"donate\" to their foundation and get your picture taken holding an owl, hawk, or other bird of prey. But the birds were on display for free, and fun to watch. You could walk all over the castle, along the battlements, really all over. They also had an archeological dig site that you could check out which was cool to see almost 2700 years of history. There were also several peacocks roaming the grounds!

First , you get to his big open space like a park with the most amazing views of the city. Then, you can visit a small archaeological museum and then proceed to the castle itself. You can read about it in your guidebooks, I'll just say it's really beautiful, with well preserved walls and towers, which you can walk on all around. I suggest a visit to Camera Obscura, it's on one of the towers, and there's a show every half an hour. Luckily, we stumbled upon the one in English. Basically, you get in this dark room and the guide uses this very simple and archaic system to project real time images of the city to a canvas, a screen. And you see whole of the city. There are only a few of these around the world, the oldest one is in Edinburgh (unfortunately I have visited Edinburgh but missed on this). After the castle you can also visit a small archaeological site. And that's it."

This view is the most attractive part of the castle. You're able to walk the castle wall (eccessible via a small stairway) to enjoy some other views.

The castle is deceptively large, so you will spend well over an hour just walking around it, as it was built over several centuries, and the history is fascinating. There is a small museum inside, with mostly archeological artifacts recovered from the dig site (so expect lots of broken pottery), and a few restaurants. There is a small side show of birds, that look miserable as they are chained to the ground - this seems cruel and unecessary and I'm not sure why the construction of an aviary wasn't considered?Aside from this, there isn't much to see, except the views. There are plenty of views, from all sides, and of course the castle is very well preserved, so if you are interested in fortresses or medieval castles, you will like this one.I gave it an average score because of the value - for that price I at least expect functioning facilities - All 3 of the toilets on the site were out of order during my visit. Then there were various push buttong exhibitions out of order also. If you make visitors pay such a high price it's probablya good idea to at least make them comfortable.I'd say if you can afford it or if you like history or castles, then you should probably visit it - getting to the castle is half the fun as you have to navigate lisbon's windy cobblestone streets which are always very scenic."

Certainly not a place for anybody who isn't mobile and like a lot of European castles outside of the UK it has the potential to be a death trap with some very low railings next to some considerable heights; that is one of the joys of visiting though. Previous reviewers have got it spot on that there isn't too much to the actual castle but the spectacular views more than make up for it.I would have given this 4 stars if it wasn't for the strange and discriminatory ticketing policy; they have a family ticket (2 adults and 2 children) that works out cheaper than paying separately for 2 adults and 1 child. I have no problem with that but on the day we visited the ticket office don't seem to have the discretion to sell the family ticket to a family, like mine, that is 2 adults but only has 1 child. In their twisted logic they have made it cheaper for 4 people to visit than 3. I did query this but was firmly told that the rules could not be broken. My advice to anyone in a similar position would be to leave your husband/wife and 1 child at the gate and go and buy the family ticket on your own, our mistake was to all go to the ticket office together."

Most of the roads are one way and up a hill. We managed but it was certainly a challenge. Make sure you wear good walking shoes and bring water as the hike pushing two kids uphill is very tiring. The Castle was great and the view fantastic! Definitely worth the hike up the hill. Since we had a pram we were able to skip the line and get tickets which was great. Not a lot of food choices once inside but we weren't after anything fancy. We found a lovely man outside the cafe doing \u20ac10 Shiatsu massages. He was very good and worth it after all the walking around. Definitely not to place to be missed if you visit Lisbon. "

Inside is mainly courtyards and there is a small museum and quite a good cafeteria where you can get fresh fruit quite cheaply. Otherwise it is mainly walking along the walls and enjoying the views of the city. What really makes this a questionable visit is the staggering line-up. I have seldom seen so many people lined up for so long and the Castle itself does not provide enough interest to make this worthwhile."

The Castle is visible from far away since it's located on the top of the highest hill in town, so it's really tempting to go and check it out. When you get inside, most of the Castle is fenced off and required purchasing a ticket to get in. Frankly, this is not the most interesting castle to see. It's basically just bare walls. They have museum inside, but it doesn't tell you much about who and how lived in that Castle (well, they mostly focused on some archeological artifacts, than on a comprehensive story about the castle). Also, it's not really kids friendly because some of the steps and walls have no rail guards, so it's really scary to walk there even for the grown ups.So if you have no better ideas - yes, it offers some nice views and will keep you busy and offers some picture opportunities."

Perhaps the view of the city as you go up can be a reward. Be prepared for the way there beforehand (e.g. mark the way on your smart phone), as the signs are quite few and confusing. Lisbon is a very hilly city so the perception from looking at the map can be deceptive.The castle itself does not have much to offer besides the view of the city (well, it's actually a fort, not a castle), in my experience 8.5 EUR is not worth it. 20 minutes insides and that's all. Rather dark and old. If you are fan of old forts like this one, try Moorish castle at Sintra instead."

It shows my dedication to him (and sightseeing), because we did this at the end of a LONG sightseeing day when it was at least 90 F outside and I was almost 7 months pregnant (and whining). Even I had to admit it was worth it. We were able to get the student rate (thank you, grad student ID from 5 years ago!!) so I was less whiny. The actual castle complex is a lot bigger than I was expecting and we walked most of it. I got a little annoyed when we walked to the section where Moorish ruins are being excavated and discovered that there was no direct way to get back - we HAD to walk up a big flight of stairs and back down again. But the views were great. The castle itself has little description, but I enjoyed it more for the atmosphere of walking around the ruins and seeing the different layers of history represented in this one spot.The complex isn't far from the trolley stop, but it seems quite daunting when looking up because you can't see it. It really only took about 5 mins to walk there. And it was nice to have a few restaurants in the surrounding neighborhood to choose from on our way back down.* If you like my review, I appreciate you clicking the 'helpful' button; those of us who take the time to write reviews live for those and it motivates us to do more :) *"

Luckily for me, Lisbon is absolutely beautiful in the rain and the view from Castelo de S\u00e3o Jorge is stunning. I found a semi-dry nook under an arch for refuge from the rain and watched the flags of Portugal and Lisbon blustered defiantly, as if battling the wind for control of the castle.After the rain subsided, I ventured from the ramparts down some stone steps to an old watch tower where only one or two other people were milling about taking advantage of the different viewpoint of the city and the River Tagus stretching out past Bel\u00e9m to join the Atlantic.After climbing back up to the main fortress, I walked around the ramparts while listening to the closest thing I had to fado on my iPod (George Dalaras, who is Greek, but good enough). The city seems to ooze melancholy in the rain. Walking past the C\u00e2mara Escura, I realized they had closed the periscope due to the rain, which was disappointing, but I don't know what I would have seen that I couldn't already.The way up the hill from the central neighborhood of Baixa is quite easy, as there are several free elevators to give you a lift up the otherwise steep hill. One even has a grocery store and a decent restroom inside! From Baixa, head over to where the hill begins and look for a modern glass building among its historic neighbors or just ask somebody for the elevator. It's the same word in Portuguese."

The staff were great - even letting us have a private view of the camera obscura as we'd have to wait an hour for the English visit. This only allows 20 people in every half an hour on the hour and half hour and they rotate between languages so check at the ticket desk when the next one is in your language. Its well worth seeing. Only point for small kids is that the walls on the parapets were quite low - and there was no barricade so do take care!

The signs do not do it justice, nor do they adequately explain what part if any of the castle that remains is Arab (Moor) and if any stones for foundation date back to the fortress of the Visigoths that stood in same place. Something like a headset tour would be appropriate here."

The castelo is located in Alfama, one of the old neighbourhoods in town. You can take a taxi or the bus, but we walked up to the entrance. So we had the possibility to see more of the area surrounding the castelo, which is tipical for Lisbon. The entrancefee is 7,50 euros, which is okay. You can walk around on groundlevel and get on several walls through steep stone stairs. Unfortunately the castelo isn't as beautiful as the one in Sintra, but the view is worth a visit. There are some musicians playing old instruments, a restaurant/caf\u00e9 and some people doing and selling their handicraft.I have been here a couple of times before, but not in recent years, but I was still impressed with the great view of the city."

The man who controls the periscope will tell you the most important things (he speaks English, Franch, Spanish and of course Portuguese) and you can also ask him anything you want to know. There is a schedule at the entrance, and if I remember correctly: at 11am is in English, at noon is in Franch.

Alternatively you can take the tram up or elevators which are now available just outside a grocery store Pingo Doce. Go earlier. We went for 10. There was NO line. When we left at 11:45, there was a HUGE line. Go check out the dark chamber show times for your language first then walk around. There are shows in English, Portuguese and Spanish. They happen in intervals of 30 min. I gets crowded later on, so try to do it early. Give yourself 2 hours here."

I cannot comment on the castle itself and its grounds beyond the restaurant area, but like reviewers before us we tried to take Tram #28 to the castle and it was packed. Soooooooooooooooo, the six of us ( yes 6 : 4 adults, a 7yr old and 8 mnth old baby and a full sized stroller) took the ride of our lives in a TUK TUK. What a blast...I highly recommend this mode of transportation up the hill as they drop you off right at the entrance to the caslte. The cost : $10.00 Euros for all of us..not per person and we took our Tuk Tuk ride from the pedestrian concourse at the bottom of the hill. Our driver spoke clear and fluent english which was a great suprize. As earlier stated, we were coming here for dinner and being all dressed up it was quite nice not having sweaty people sticking to you on the ride up. Think sardine can for a depiction of what Tram #28 looked like. I can comment on the night views of the skyline and they were beautiful. The one downside with us going to the castle for dinner at night is that the Tuk Tuks do not come to the castle at night. Therefore, we (the group) all like to explore so we ended up walking down all the way. During our walk, we came across several neat restaurants where the locals were all watching the world cup and it was quite an experience. We ended up going into a few and had a blast."

There is a camera obscura in one of the towers and it is worth trying - the guide shows you the city, explains where is what and tells a lot about the history (it takes about 20 minutes) - it is certainly very interesting. The presentations are held every half and hour and in different languages. Take good shoes, as the old stones are quite slippery and stairs steep."

It was once free to visit the castle but nowadays there is a charge of \u20ac7.50 for the dubious privelidge of viewing the city. There are spectacular viewing points at Graca and Largo do Portas do Sol which cost nothing, have cheaper caf\u00e9s and are less crowded. It's notable that Lisbon residents have free access to the Castle, as they would laugh at the idea of paying into a ruin. If pushedf I'd say that visitors can walk along the castle walls, although there are similar experiences to be had in Sintra and Sesimbra which cost nothing. All in all this falls well into the category of rip-off tourist-trap."

[Don't spend your money on the expensive tourist trams doing the same route!] Excellent panoramic views, a visit to the Decorative Arts Museum (4 Euros - allow under one hour), lovely handmade craft shops near the castle entry, friendly open air restaurant for a delicious lunch, checkout the art installation at the back of a nearby cafe featuring thousands of silk flowers arranged on the derelict brick remnant walls, visit the beautiful church five minutes down the hill from the castle.

Perhaps combine your trip with a visit to the cathedral as well and if you choose to do this late enough in the day, you can maybe hear some Fado on the way down. Tickets are 7.50 euro each and there is a free map available in different languages. If the weather is hot, do go early as the queues can be very long, and definitely take a bottle of water too. Definitely wear the right footwear and be advised the castle isn't suitable for wheelchairs or those who have trouble walking. There are also some nice (but expensive) gift shops on the way down, which sell some slightly unusual things."

That said, the street life is great, and there are plenty of caf\u00e9s or restaurants where you could have a stop-off on the way.You could also grab the #28 tram to relatively near the castle, and walk the last 10min or so.The entrance fee of \u20ac7.50 (\u20ac5 for under 25) was reasonable, and although there was a big queue to the ticket office (which is across the road from the actual entrance) it moved swiftly along.Once inside, the castle mostly consists of a couple of courtyards (shaded by trees), and the fortified walls - which you can mostly climb up and walk on top of. There is no real indoor area or elaborate castle interior - you simply come here for the view and the walls!In terms of amenities there are several free toilet blocks, and a cheap(er) caf\u00e9 and a more expensive restaurant - though I wouldn't bother with either."

At least you know it was big since it occupies a really big area. You can go up some stairs and walk around to one of the towers but it's a bit dangerous and the steps are very steep. You can also see what's left of some houses built just outside of the walls of the castle (cross the bridge to the main entrance and go to your right, follow the signs)Look around for what seems to be the official pet of the castle, a peacock walking around freely with its babies :)"

This is not a palace. This is a fortress so there is no residence to tour or interior of any serious sort. It is walls, towers and that is it.

We got off at the end of the line and started walking, looking for the castle. After wandering around in the general direction, we almost accidentally found it and paid our 7.50 Euro entry fee. Although not as neat as the Castelo do Mouros in Sintra, it was still pretty cool. We stopped at the castle's cafeteria for a couple of pastries and coffees. Here is where I met my 'friend', the female peacock. She was one of 3 or 4 peacocks wandering around loose, and I think the only female. She apparently noticed that I had food that she wanted, and proceeded to beg by snaking her neck up near the table where I was eating. I think I made a mistake either by giving her a couple of small pieces of my pastry, or by not continuing to do so. When I didn't offer any more pieces, she decided she'd jump up almost into my lap and snatch a mouthful on her own, almost taking my hand with it! Oh well, it was an interesting experience."

The site itself is well maintained and you can explore almost everywhere, but it is really worth it for the views over the rest of Lisbon. You can take in the Baixa, Barrio Alto, and Rossio districts while also getting a good long distance view of the 25 April Bridge and the statue of Jesus. Take the time to explore all the castle's nooks and crannies for a variety of view points."

A taxi is easy and cheap and takes you very close. I imagine the queues must be terrific at times as it was a most inefficient process both to buy tickets and then enter through the turnstiles. The site is remarkably under-signed but with terrific views over Lisbon and the harbour. The restoration of the fortifications emphasises the stronghold that Lisbon was. It was a pleasure walking around and enjoying the views. The site seems to be well tended with no litter, peace and quiet and very good toilet facilities. But you may have to avoid weekends and holidays! Beware that the peacocks don't try to share your lunch at the cafe."

I feel it was a great way to see the city from above and it was also unique to be able to climb around on a real castle. Views, views, views. I sound like a realtor, but this place should be your starting point if you plan to visit Lisbon! We walked around for over an hour taking photos and just enjoying the vistas of the downtown and the harbor, as well as the bridge and surrounding hills. Then we joined the Sandeman's New Lisbon free walking tour and saw the important sites around the city itself. For having one day in Lisbon, we really feel we maximized our time and will absolutely be back to see this gorgeous city!"

Most of people take the tram 28 because it is one of the oldest and because the road goes up to the hill. However, if you can, I highly recommend doing it on foot. It is about 20 minutes from Rossio square and you walk through nice little streets with cobble stones; you\u2019ll have plenty of opportunities to take nice pictures, including of the trams going up and down the hill\u2026 The castle is rather large and you have an opportunity to walk on the ramparts all around it (plenty of pictures to be taken there\u2026..) I also enjoyed the 30 minutes visit of the \u2018camera oscura\u2019 (at 10:30am for English); they bring you to a dark room and use a telescope to show you live images from Lisbon surrounding the castle. It is interesting and informative as the guide explains a lot about Lisbon\u2019s history. Little advice: when you get to the mirror position yourself on the side closest to the entrance to have the best and most complete view of the city. While walking around the castle, make sure you spot the peacocks for a nice picture. On the way back down you\u2019ll have the opportunity to buy local artisanal products that are unique; just passed the Cathedral there is a very nice shop selling all wool products (clothes but also fridge magnets and other things. It\u2019s definitely worth a visit!!)"

He did NOT try to steer us to an expensive bottle of wine but one that would fit our taste and it was delicious for 30 E. Hard to find that at home for that price point. My husband did the tasting meal and was very happy with the choices guided by the waiter as we wanted to try local Lisbon or Portugese fare. After having dinner, we walked outside for a nice, leisurely walk around the castle and took pictures of the city from the high view of the castle. It truly felt like we had our own castle! the meal was not rushed and like most places in Europe, you have to ask for the check to get them to bring it. Our hotel concierge tried to discourage us from going saying it was expensive but we thoroughly enjoyed the food, quality, atmosphere and felt our meal was much better than at Zambeze which is where they steered us the first night which had the worst service i ever encountered.

The male peacocks make a lot of noise from the more points you high and proudly show the wheels of their feathers without any fear of the proximity of humans. Inside the Castle and ' possible to book to get into a \"Dark Room\" which is projected the vision of Lisbon at 360 degrees in real time through the use of a periscope installed on top of a tower above the projection room .

After taking our city photos, we walked to the other end of the castle and climbed the ramparts for even better views. When we were hungry, we found the little caf\u00e9 and enjoyed sandwiches, chips/crisps, and ginginja in chocolate cups. As we ate on the tables outside the cafe, peacocks and peahens wandered around us. At one point, one of the peacocks decided to show off his plumage right in front of the caf\u00e9 door. Just to make sure we noticed, he shook his feathers and tail periodically.

Given it's located probably at the highest point of Lisbon, it has 360 degree view of the city. It was fun to walk on the castle walls. The archeology site was interesting. I like the way they built a simple walls that represented the building structure of the time. It gave me a good idea how they looked like hundreds years ago/ Unfortunately, there isn't too much else to see inside castle."

I was a little unsure at first having herd there's nothing really at the castle and yet you pay 7 euros 50. Anyway, we made our way on the tram and followed the steep hills. We arrived around half five in the evening and the sun was at its peak. There is a teeny tiny ticket office..be sure not to miss it! The huge bonus here was, although there were a fair few people there were no que!Up more steep hills, round the corner, through the ticket barrier and...Ta-dah! There is lovely Lisbon laid out in all it's glory. The first view you get is of the bridge and the Christ the King statue which is just spectacular! Have a good look around all of the castle although be warned....there are some VERY steep steps and rocky paving at some points...walls are also very low! I suppose essentially they have just used the castle as a way of climbing various levels to get good panoramic shots, however if you like architecture it's probably a very good building to explore. The castle grounds are very nice to walk around. Is it worth 7 euros 50? Probably not in reality but....the views make you forget all about that. The price does slash by about half if you are a student, child, older person etc so don't forget to mention these things/bring your ID cards with you!!"

All the time you spend in Lisbon, your eye will keep being drawn to the Castelo de Sao Jorge, perching on top of one of Lisbon's highest hills, so when it came to a sunny Sunday morning, it was time to satisfy the urge to climb the hill, past the Se, to see it for myself.The route isn't particularly clearly marked, so watch out for taking the wrong road - in short, once you have passed the Se, you'll pass alongside the tram tracks for another quarter mile or so, then you'll need to head straight up hill once you reach Santa Luzia. It's a bit steep, but there's a handy outdoor urinal if you need a toilet break en route!If you're not up for walking, the tram will take you most of the way and there is a bus as well.The ticket office is just across from the main entrance - all very straightforward and you're given a helpful map of the site as well.The views across Lisbon from the ramparts are typically excellent for a castle in this sort of position - accompanied by the remains of the cannons that once protected the city.There is a permanent exhibition inside the main castle building itself, which is a bit limited, as well as a decent cafe, which is patrolled by several peacocks and peahens, some of which will almost certainly decide to make a bit of a show of themselves.The castle keep is also accessible, with some pretty steep ascents to higher levels, some of which are fairly narrow, so watch your step!A definite on your Lisbon itinerary."

The castle is in fact a ruin and the entrance fee is worth the price if you enjoy spectacular views and old walls and stairs. A \"mature\" man, dressed in era-appropriate clothing, plays a flute while dirty cats lie on his coat eating something strange. If you try to take a photo of him, he turns his back unless you place money in his coat. Other than that, there are a few beautiful peacocks and a shop to buy souvenirs (the same items are cheaper in downtown Lisbon). If you would like to see Leonardo da Vinci's telescope you need to buy another ticket and the tour is only available at certain times. We did not want to wait 45mins to enter the museum nor pay more money so we wandered around some more and left the castle to get some hot chocolate in the cafe downstairs. In the streets below, we found many stores selling lace items and the like. I'd suggest the walk back down to Lisbon but not the walk uphill to the castle. We missed the tram stop for the castle and hiked our way up; an awful experience for the unfit but great exercise!"

The small museum was fantastic really well exhibited with some great information and the chap in there was very knowledgeable and helpful.There are several ways to get there... by foot (hard work), tram (28E) which doesn't drop you off at the entrance or you hop on a 737 mini bus which runs from Praca da Figueira and which is free if you have a travel pass or lisboa card - it drops you right outside the main entrance and this is the only public transport which does.

That added charm to the visit if you have the time to poke around the neighborhoods."

The last time we visited Lisbon a few years ago entrance to the castle was free however there is now a 7.50euro entrance charge although there is now more to see than before. An excellent vantage point over looking the city (which I guess why it was built there) but do bear in mind, the lanes and footpaths leading up to the castle are on a steep hill, and you have to walk uphill a lot, but it is rewarding when you reach it and stopping off at the various gift shops and galleries makes for a nice break during the walk You can if you wish take the bus or hire a TukTuk. The views from the castle are stunning, however some of the walks along the castles walls and stairs up to, along and down from the towers can be some what difficult for those less agile. A excellent place to view most parts of the city.After the walking and picture taking why not relax outside the small cafe and watch the peacocks parade around and the castle cats chasing (and sometime catching) pigeions.."

There is of course the magnificent view over Lisbon but there are lots of ramparts and towers to walk round, although some of them are uneven and you do need to be careful. You can also see some old Moorish house remains and other archaeological sites. These are a bit away from the main part of the castle but were very interesting. We had a drink at the cafe in the grounds and watched the peacocks roaming around. We spent over 2 hours there and felt it was worth the entry fee."

As we were heading up the streets toward the castle, we stumbled upon a sign for an elevator. The elevator is part of a grocery store and car park, but takes you right up the hill. There is a small discount on the entrance fee to the castle with the Lisboa Card. The views of the city are pretty. Watch out for the cobblestones as they are uneven and slippery. There are areas of the castle where you can walk up to the towers and along the walls. The steps are uneven and in some areas there are no railings, as well as very low walls. This is not the place for anyone with mobility issues. Be very careful, especially with small children."

The view is excellent and there were interesting gift shops and a few artisans, as well as a flute player who added to the atmosphere and made it feel as if you had gone back in time. A great experience and well worth the effort. There are cafes and restaurants in the area.Tips: For all attractions check opening & closing times to avoid disappointment. The Lisbon Card is very useful especially if you are in Lisbon for a few days. We purchased the 72 hour card and it was so convenient for all forms of transports as well as providing free or discounted entry into attractions. It paid for itself and we ended up marking significant savings overall."

As someone growing up in north america we just dont have authentic castles and this one is magnificient. It has not been modified in any way for safety. stairs are very steep, narrow and low (knee) high walls on the top. If you are scared of heights or cant climb stairs you may want to pass or just enjoy the main grounds on the entrance way. What you see on the outside does not prepare you for the inside which is a museum, a courtyard and then an entranceway into the castle grounds. The views from here are of course only seen from the top of the walls. The courtyard on the ground level does have spectacular views of Lisbon. We walked down to the city square from here, a mile or two and there were lots and lots of little shops and restaurants along the way. Just keep walking downhill and you will find the square and the river. Be warned that the gift shop inside the castle has the same souvineers as outside but at a huge increase in price."

We were warned about pickpockets on the tram to get here, but we took the bus from the main square and had no issues. I was surprised at how much of the old castle is open to those adventurous enough to climb the stairs. Handrails are often in short supply so take care when climbing up and down steep stairs. If you are into history, it's a must. Even if you aren't, it's a lovely place to spend an afternoon and relax.Not recommended if you have any kind of mobility issues."

My topic is a specific warning that it's important that you protect yourself from pickpockets at all times. They pose as tourists and work in groups. One person spots potential marks by observing what you have (cell phones in particular) and where you keep it. The spotter then gives this the information by phone to two others who will follow you until you reach a vulnerable spot. Zip up any bag, pocket, etc. Always. My wife was robbed in September 2013 after visiting the Castle. We went back a few days later to spot the criminals, observe what they do, and photograph them so that we could warn others. The attached photos are of pickpockets that work in Alfama, near Castelo de Sao Jorge and the Miradoro de Santa Luzia. The one on the phone is the spotter. The three men walking are the pickpockets who follow you and strike when your attention is diverted. They dressed exactly the same way both the day that they robbed us and a few days later. After they steal your phone, they hide it in their back pockets -- you can even see bulges in one of the photos. I've already given these photos to the Lisbon police, but only you can protect yourself from being robbed in the first place. Please share these photos with whomever is going to this area."

Should you not mind walking, I suggest you walk to Rua da Madalena and take the Escadinhas de S\u00e3o Crist\u00f3v\u00e3o (a long flight of stairs that brings you to a churchyard and then walk right along the hill on Rua Costa do Castelo and past Chapit\u00f4."

The castle has some incredible views of the city and is beautiful itself. My favorite thing is the camera obscura where they have tours every 30 minutes and they rotate between Portuguese, English, and Spanish. Make sure to get in line because only 20 people are allowed at a time! I recommend going to this spot first, seeing the city through the camera obscura, and then deciding where else in the city you really want to go because camera obscura guide will give you lots of info! Also, tickets for entrance are only 4 euros for students so bring your university card if possible!"

If you take a crowded tram to get up the hill, watch out for pickpockets! Alternatively, the 737 bus takes you much closer to the castle entrance but the road is rough and our driver turned the trip into a white-knuckle ride."

            "review": "Knights Templar stronghold.. The Castle is obviously located on top of a large hill overlooking Lisbon and the view is wonderful. The fun way to get there from below is to use the tram. The tram can get very busy at peak times, so be patient, but once up there it is easy to reach the ticket area. As usual you must buy your ticket before you go to the entrance and there can be queues again in busy times. The turnstiles are London underground like and only work once, so don't wander back out (which is easy) or you will have to pay again.Once in through the turnstile though you can spend as long as you like there walking around the grounds, taking in the views, visiting the interior of the Castle and its walls and then have a drink and a pastry (avoid sitting under large branches of the trees, the peacocks are quite generous!) The history and explanations are a little thin on the ground so don't expect any in depth education and the rebuilt parts of the walls are of concrete, not limestone mortar so not good for erosion, watch your step! The camera obscura is a novelty and very good for seeing a little more. If you just want to chill out its a great place to be. Oh and you can even have your picture taken with your favourite bird of prey!"

We had the Lisboa card with which we got 30% discount for entry to the castle which proved quite useful considering the expensive entry fee to the castle costing around 9-10 Euro each ticket.The castle was once a fortress (taken by the Moors in 1147 AD) which explains it's strategic location on a hill top offering fantastic views over the city and the Tagus river. You can also get scenic vistas of the Alfama or the old part of the city and the 25th April Bridge from the castle precincts. The 10-15 minutes journey by the vintage yellow coloured Lisbon trams from Figuera Square to the castle also offers panoramic views of the city. Would definitely suggest as a must visit attraction in Lisbon for tourists."

Either way, once you enter the Castle you won't be disappointed. The fortress is mostly ruins., with a museum housing artefacts from its sat, but what you go for is a wonderful view of Lisbon. It allows one to get an over view of this lovely city. We went early in the morning before the crowds and were rewarded with a serene and quiet time. We walked on the walls and were lucky enough to get into the Camera Obscura tour which was excellent. This huge periscope and the guide talked us through the city in real time.

St.George's castle is a mix of the last two as there is no \"inside\" to really visitWhat I liked: Totally open air, busy but not too crowded. A good mix of shaded and sunny area. Main pathways relatively well maintained making it ok for use with a stroller (but could be a bit better). Safe environment and great overall views of Lisbon and the sea. Some food light food options on site. Not too big so that it can be done in a relatively good amount of time.

The setting on top of the hill offers magnificent views of Lisbon and the tree shaded grounds are cool and calming... a welcome relief from the hot summer sun.

There is a charge of several Euros, which as seniors (or as the sign said \"persons with deficiencies\") is much less, but you must have proof of age.

This is one of the best fortress's I have visited, it is beautifully maintained by the castle staff and is an amazing place to spend and afternoon in Lisbon. The outer grounds of the castle are lovely and shady, with the most amazing views over the old parts of Lisbon. The museum on site was very good, with a large collection of imported Roman and Greek kylix's and pottery. The castle itself, as mentioned before, doesn't have any interior decoration but the courtyards have the old foundations of many buildings which is interesting if you have any knowledge of this type of fortress castle. This castle also has the best bathroom facilities for an attraction of this type that I have ever used. This attraction is well worth the climb from lower Lisbon, if walking the locals are more than happy to give directions and the area around the castle is full of little cafe's and restaurants for rest stops."

It was an hot July afternoon, and so we were really pleased to enter this cool place and enjoyed a stunning view over the Lisbon old town area. It would be a wonderful place for picnic to while away a lazy summer day, too. The castle is huge and you can climb up the walls and walk about the ramparts. Good fun for kids, but not for under 5, as bits of it are steep and precarious. After the castle, we went on taking the same tram up to its last stop and found this beautiful church, which we spotted through the castle's window, offering good photo spot of the Castle. The 6 euro day ticket for each person bought from the metro vending machine allowed us to take all public transport in Lisbon in 24 hours, and so we got good value out of it. Highly recommended!"

The castle did cost about 7 Euros each which we worried might be a bit expensive, but given we had such a nice afternoon and only had time to do one 'touristy' thing I'm glad we did. The view is pretty great, I would try and go up on a clear day if possible, just to get the most out of it, but a great photo opporunity none the less. We also went on the periscope tour which is located in the Tower of Uylsses part of the castle. The talk inside seemed interesting, although given it was in Spanish we didn't get anything from it. It seemed like other talks may be in English but it wasn't clear at the beginning ours was not to be - tip check before hand. The periscope itself it quite impressive and looke d a good way to find out more abotu the history of the city. All in all, a good place to get above the city and have a good tourist experience."

We watched cruise ships, cargos ships and all manner of boats go in and out of the harbor. My only concern was the lack of safety rails around the high levels. There is easily a 60 foot drop in some spots of the castle. If you are afraid of heights or have small kids, take care. We had a driver take us there so access is fairly easy.

The walk up to the castle wasn't the most fun I've ever had on a 95 degree summer day, but I am glad we did it. Great views of Lisbon and some great views inside the castle as well. We went with our two-year old and she had no trouble navigating the castle and we weren't worried about her injuring herself. It likely won't be the highlight of your trip, but it is worth a visit while in Lisbon...hopefully on a cooler day."

My disappointment was with the lack of tour guides, reference information, historical background information, or anything else that makes a visit to a location like this more meaningful. Entrance is not cheap. If I knew what to expect, I don't think I'd have paid to go in. My recommendation... Take a photo with the castle in the background - you can do that for free...!"

There is a special entrance price for Seniors but you have to ask for it. The views from the walls over Lisbon are wonderful. Although the layout of the castle is preserved there is not a lot to see other than climbing steep steps up the ramparts which would never pass UK Health and Safety regulations. (Where in Portugal does?) The refreshment facility is in a lovely shaded courtyard and reasonably priced. Toilet facilities are clean and conveniently located. An essential visit in any itinerary in Lisbon."

I don't know their rules on food, but they don't check your bags when you enter, so I would maybe recommend taking a picnic or a snack up there to enjoy.

The day I visited there were some little school children there being entertained with a little skit with actors dressed in period costume.

You can choose to climb the stairs and walk around the walls that protected the castle from siege in times past to get lovely views of the city. If you're lucky you may just see a peacock or two. Getting there is easy as well, just hop on a tram or bus.

This particular location has had some type of fort on it since the Romans and it's easy to see why when you finally get to the top and can look out over the city below. It's built on top of the main hill in Lisbon so it affords fantastic views of the entire city, and the surrounding countryside. I highly recommend visiting the castle first thing in the morning when you are well rested and full of energy because it is quite a walk to get to and quite a walk/climb to explore once you do get there (it's also cooler in the morning). It's also a good idea to visit it early in your visit to Lisbon because it gives you such a great 360 view that you can easily plan your next adventure in the city. Finally. there is only one entrance into the castle so don't make the mistake we made of coming from the wrong direction and then having to walk all around the walls looking for a way in. Approach the castle from the southwest and you should be fine, ask tourists and locals for directions along the way because there is very little signage.Be wary that the castle and its ramparts have very low walls and no guardrails so if you are afraid of heights or have poor balance you probably want to stick to the safer areasFinally, make sure you get a LISBOA card first thing when you get to the city, it gives you free public transport and a discount (sometimes 100% off) on all attractions, it's well worth the cost and can be acquired at any tourist information center"

(You'll have to run the gauntlet to get in, though.) The grounds also have some fascinatingly ancient olive trees, and beautiful wild poppies at the time of our visit.It's possible to get there on the 28 tram, but the 12 tram is far less crowded. The small 737 bus gets nearest of all to the entrance. All leave from praca Figueira. The castle itself is a fort, not a live-in building, and of no more than moderate interest. The barriers are quite low in places, so look out! I'd have liked to see the camera obscura, but they only let groups in every 30min, so I had to miss it.There is an archaeological site of some ancient ruins on site, though there isn't much to see yet - the oldest ruins are dated to 700BC, apparently."

The castle can be approached on foot (follow the route 28 tram tracks) or take the tram, there is a bus or if you need a taxi. The castle is now only represented by the walls, there is an outer wall. As you pass through the gate purchase your ticket on your right, then proceed to the gate of the castle. While there is a museum of archeological finds and the sites of previous digs there are no other structures other than the walls of the outer and inner castle. The view is reason enough to make the visit."

Around the fortress you can find nice shops which are not more expensive than in downtown.Only where I find problem is how to get there. If you choose old tram line 28 you will be in problem because you don't know where to step down. I missed the best station and goes until the last tram station. From there there are many narrow streets lacking any signs which will lead you to the castle. Entrance is not well signed. My suggestion is to take taxi which can bring you just in front of the ticket office. For the way back walk down and enjoy in the view, churches, nice shops and ambient."

As with most attractions and things to do in Portugal, admission was not expensive. Until I visited the castle, I did not get a true understanding of the size and appearance of the city. Within the castle, there are various sets of stairs and elevated areas from which you can view the city. Because there are so many small, winding, and cobblestone streets in Lisbon, visiting the castle and marvelling at the city provides a much better feel for the Portuguese capital. There are also seated areas surrounded by trees (and peacocks!), making for a lovely break or snack during a hot summer's day. And just outside the castle, at the bottom of the hill, you can catch the 28 tram, the most well-known tram ride in Lisbon, which provides another great view of and feel for the city. Overall, the castle is a great attraction, whether you are traveling solo, with friends or with family."

It is located on the highest point of the city with the natural slopes from all sides. The castle was built mostly for defense and not as a residence. It has eleven towers, the most noted are: Tower of the KeepTower of Ulysses, Tower of St.Lawrence and Palace Tower. On the northern wall there is a small door called the Door of Treason, which allowed the messengers to enter and exit in secret. Later, the King Alfonso Henriques modified and enlarged the castle to accommodate his Court. By 13th century the castle was transformed intothe Royal Palace, but in 1755 during Lisbon earthquake, most of the castle was destroyed."

The massively solid Castelo San Giorgio, perched on one of the highest points adjacent to the Chiado and Praca do Comercio, dates from the 11th Cent. but has passed through many phases, including that of being a Royal Palace ( 13th Cent.), and a military barracks for the then ruling Spanish army ( 17th Cent.). Its walls are massive, wide, and very extensive. Of its eleven towers, four offer accessible viewing platforms. They are integrated into an exciting walk of over 300 meters along the walls that reveals every part of the city, and in its grounds and parks there are other belvederes that extend the viewing opportunities. It was badly affected b y the 1755 earthquake, and partial ruins of earlier constructions are to be seen in the gardens, Its visitors can choose from a large cafe and a fine Michelin-recommended restaurant (Casa Do Leao: operated by the Pousada organization and open from 12.30 to 11pm) where we enjoyed an excellent and affordable lunch. A Camera Obscura following a design by Leonardo da Vinci ( not working because of bad weather during our visit) and a modest Archaeological Museum are other attractions the Castelo offers. There is no finer Castle in all of Europe: its privileged position, and outstanding state of preservation and reconstruction, as well as its superb amenities, are cutely complemented by a large flock of variously-colored peacocks who arrogantly strut around as if they own he place, taking no nonsense from the tourists."

The castle, though a little on the pricey side for admission (7 euro; which is a lot by Portuguese standards), is a great place to visit for exploration of its ramparts and various towers. It offers a commanding view over the city. It really comes into its own at night (open till 9pm), being one of very few castles that keeps its doors open to the wandering public after hours and where the operators are surprisingly laissez faire about visitors safe conduct in the dark, given the narrow walkways, very low railings and perilous drops. Also, the calling of the peacocks at sunset can be quit atmospheric.The castle doesn't offer much in the way of traditionally decorated rooms or artefacts, but it is a great place for being free to explore and to get an impression of what it must have been like to stand guard back in the day."

The visitor can wander the castle walls and get a fine view of Lisbon from the battlements, but be warned that the stairs are original, which makes them slippery and of awkward heights (I watched one young fashionable lady try and negotiate the area in high heels - a major mistake on her part). However, after spending maybe an hour going from side to side of the castle and taking photos, there isn't much to do afterwards. The camera obscura is only available when the weather is decent (I was there on a blustery cold wet afternoon). Restaurants are available within the castle site, but there are also many right outside the walls. Parking is limited in the area, and the walk uphill can be rigorous."

More of a fortress than a castle, stocked with cannons and other relics of a much earlier time, including a recreation of Da Vinci's Camera Obscura. Kids (ages 6 and above) will love walking on the castle walls and climbing the towers, and the views of the city and ocean are really breathtaking. And do not miss the ruins from the old Roman and Moorish precursor castles (ask security to let you through the ropes to take a look, they are more than happy to oblige). However, this is NOT a place for younger children. Stairs are steep, and railings are not ubiquitous. Further, there are dangerous gaps between stairs and railings that a younger child could slip and fall through if a parent looks away for even a second. Carrying strollers up those stairs could prove exhausting, and there aren't many places to leave your personal items. Finally, bring comfortable shoes- all of the cobblestone, tile and rock floors will seriously test your feet. If you're feeling up to it afterwards, I recommend walking down the streets of Alfama, the neighborhood is fascinating."

It was already later - short after18 pm, got around there and we were not allowed in any more!! The castle closes its gate at 18pm and we learned that the last entry is at 17.30. So we were bit dissapointed same as several people around, but the gate guards were strict. The next day we went earlier and found out that tram number 12 goes up there. We took the tram and it was very adventurous ride. We got off stop earlier and walked the rest.Entry to the castle is 7,50 eur but its definitely worth it!! The castle area is quite big and because its on a hill there are wonderful views. You can go up to the fortress and walk on the top of the castle walls. Here I suggest to take comfortable best soort shoes. Going up the castle walls is nothing for those who have highs fear. It can also be and at my visit there, it was very windy! Definitely go there for the great view of Lisabon!On the way back we went few streets down and then found free elevator that took us down to Baixa."

I think if I was traveling just with my husband, I would've given this attraction a \"very good\" rating, but with my twin toddlers tagging along, I have to give it a \"good\" review. The reason why it's because it has a lot of dangerous spots for small children, so one has to be very attentive at all times, which ends up impacting your own experience. Neverthless, my girls had a good time, lots of space for them to run. There is also a museum and the views of Lisbon are beautiful."

The caste ruins are completely 'open air' (eg no enclosure) so I wouldn't recommend this attraction on a rainy day. You can climb up the castle steps and walk the perimeter wall which I highly recommend - but be careful - there is little guarding or rails to support you. Great climbing for older kids, but I would be wary walking the perimeter with little ones. But once on the walls, the views are breathtaking. There is also some type of bird sanctuary & we saw beautiful peacocks strolling around the grounds - a nice surprise."

You can see clear over the Tagus river with Cristo Rei in the distance, Alfama, Rossio Square, and other sights as well. This is especially dramatic at sunset. If these views are of no particular interest, however, i should warn you that these are basically ruins more than anything. no suits of armor.... no torture chamber...... this isn't the Tower of London. You will see some cannons aimed toward the city however! There were some excavation efforts being done which was of no real interest to me but others might find neat. Be careful with the steps as some of them are \"dusty\" and slippery as a result. no handrails either. I almost lost my balance twice descending a flight of stairs which could have proved disasterous. There is a restaurant on site and bathrooms also.

If you can walk up the hill enjoy the streets, wave at the children, smile at the old folks and nod to the gossiping locals as you pass by. It isn't a hard climb or very long, so take your time and look up, about and around. The Castle is cheap to enter and easy to navigate. Splendid battlements, plenty of signs, cannons, moat, draw bridge, what more could anyone want in a Castle? Oh yes, a nice place to eat and watch the artist feeding the cats, who chase the peacocks."

If I could just review it on its' own and forget the 9th century Moorish castle I saw in Sintra, the 12th century Convento de Cristo in Tomar, I would say its a perfectly nice newish castle. But its hard to forget those other things and in comparison this castle is a let down. It is also very small and much of it has been turned into a gift shop and dining area.

Before we left the hotel we metioned how we really were not exercising while on vacation, however, that changed fairly quick. There are many sets of stairs and uphill walkways at the castle. We surely got our workout that day! If you are not prepared to do a lot of stair climbing and uphill walking, I would think the only thing you could do here is visit the museum. The views of the city are just amazing and we found the archelogical site located there quite interesting. There any dining options available, we choose to have a light lunch and some sangria at the cafe where there is both indoor and outdoor seating.Beware...there are many vendors set up around the castle....people selling jewerly, art work, chair masssages....however they did not appear too pushy to sell their items and any pandhandlers were located outside the gates of the castle. There was also an incredible number...probably at least 20....of stray cats at the castle. The amount of peacocks and birds can be a bit annoying since we sat outside and they seem to have no fear of people and like to beg.Overall, it really was a good, once in a lifetime experience. Again, the sight was incredible and beautiful as were the views. We made it a day trip and even though we only spent about 2 hours at the castle, we continued our afternoon shopping in the neighborhood outside of the castle and visiting some wine shops and a great little bistro. We were able to get some appetizers and some of the best sangria I had ever tasted."

This is a line from Sophia de Mello\u2019s poem (I\u2019d say, ode to Lisbon), which is carved on a big stone in the Castle terraced square. The poet was right, there\u2019s no better place to enjoy the panorama of Lisbon. Fantastic views, the best, better than from Cristo Rei! When you climb all the towers and walk through all galleries you see that it was a really fortified citadel with barbicans and narrow loopholes, used probably to pour tar or something on the enemies. Now the castle looks totally peaceful; a lot of peacocks feel at home there. There\u2019s a lovely caf\u00e9 close to the Romantic Garden with snacks, fruit and chocolates, as you sit at a table outside, beautiful birds walk around."

My friend wanted to see the Castle and we did have the opportunity to visit the Museum and the castle grounds with superb views over the city. The archaelogical site was a disappointment because we had to climb up the walls of the castle, with notices saying danger of falling, but then the way out on the pathway was blocked by gates and we had to climb back up the same walls to go down. It would have been helpful to have a sign at the bottom telling people that they would have to undertake a climb to come back as well. The maps show a pathway leading away from the site. This did rather spoil our visit to a beautiful place."

A lot of the castle was destroyed during the great earthquake of 1755. Now the castle is one of the tourist favorites because it has the best views of the city.

A most interesting fortress encompassing several periods of history, so worth visiting in its own right, and in addition it commands superb views over the city and the river. You can wander to your heart's content along the top of the battlements, or pop in to a small museum of some of the artefacts unearthed during archaeological excavations. There is a small caf\u00e9 which offers a good choice of hot and cold food (but very slow counter service) and outdoor tables, also a 'proper' restaurant which we didn't sample. Many peacocks roam freely, and several had chicks of varying sizes.Rather limited provision of toilet facilities - and my wife told me that the door locks on the cubicles in the women's area were all broken."

It was very cool, but like lots of people have said-- the views are what make this place amazing.I think it is a must-see in Lisbon! It is very difficult to find, hidden away on the streets of Alfama. (How can a big castle be hidden?? You'll see.) I would have a good map ready, and be prepared to ask any locals to point you in the right direction if you need to.Because it is a loooong walk uphill from Baixa (downtown), I recommend taking the 28 tram up from the center of town to Gra\u00e7a church, have a cold drink and a look at the lovely cafe/miradouro there, then walk DOWNhill to get to the castle.

After a nice walk up the hill there was a bit of a queue to get tickets for the castle, and once into the grounds the views over the surrounding area were fantastic! When climbing up into the castle itself, it is great that full access is allowed, however i have to say some bits were a bit scary due to the narrow paths and steep falls at some points - i found myself hugging a wall at one very narrow point up on the walls and was quite glad to get back down to ground level. The staff in the cafe could be more customer focussed. The afternoon we visited customers seemed to be getting in the way of their conversations, but all in all iot was a very interesting place to visit."

All you see are courtyards, you go through one, through a opening in the wall and into -- another courtyard. Just grass, no gardens (on the interior I'm talking about ). And you can climb the skinny staircases to get another view. But the only place people actually lived were in the gift-store, which obviously doesn't show much, other than souvenirs. I had expected a castle would at least have a few rooms decorated in period furniture & artwork, etc. You won't get it here."

Climbing up to the towers requires climbing some pretty narrow stairs, but the views from the towers are the best.We did climb up, although we happened to find an elevator (in a building in the south end of Largo da Alafona), which helped us halfway. After we got up there, being already tired from the climb, we saw the bus number 737 there. Looks like it runs every 10 minutes, starting from Pra\u00e7a da Figueira. I was so disappointed to see, that we could have avoided the whole climb by just taking the bus. Some people were also coming there by taxi."

It is rather over sold as the views are its main asset, the buildings and walls are basically archeology now. The garden areas were very quiet and relaxing when we were there, with several peacocks patrolling, watched by the Castle cats. Be aware that there are steep steps up to the ramparts and that the courtyard side on the ramparts is un-guarded. Worth including in a tour of the Alfama"

One can walk up into the enclosing walls and visit all the vendors and houses without paying for the entrance fee. Once you do pay the fee, then you can go into the ruins and photo the view. But, if you are this far up in Lisbon you have probably already photographed that view a dozen or more times. And, unless you have never seen castle ruins I would re-think paying the fee. There are 100s of photo ops at every turn without going into the ruins. Pretty doorways. Singing canaries in their cages outside people's houses. Stairs to the top of the wall for a lookout and free photo op. And, of course, lots of vendors. We milled around for quite some time in the non-ruin section, when we heard activity and saw a couple of Police motorcycyles coming into the castle entrance. So, we decided to investigate. We walked back down to the gate and there were a dozen horses and horse soldiers unmounted milling about at the entrance. Wow. This is cool. We were surprised to see tourists, horses, and military persons all mixed up in one large swarming ball. My friend, who is Spanish, asked a policeman what was happening. He said there was going to be a parade of sorts. So we waited. The horse soldiers finally got their hats on and mounted their horses. Finally, more horses and mounted riders came out of the castle gate- meanwhile 100s of tourists were squished along the side of the street. The horses had on bright silver shoes. They frequently lost their footing and slipped several inches or a couple times they slipped a foot on the sloped cobblestones. At one point, we realized if one of these horses fell we would be mashed tourists! Pretty soon, a nearly lifesize figure of St George tied to a horse came out of the castle. St George was pretty shop worn. If I understood correctly, he came out of the church within the castle and was going to another church. The horses had to continue out the gate, join the waiting horses, then go around a steep bend on a sharp slope and travel down the street. About half the horses made it around that bend when one horse lost his footing and fell. The rider was thrown off. He lost his hat, his staff, and I would imagine he was hurt. But, several military stewards came and helped him back on the horse. He reset his hat and off they went, again. We decided that it was unsafe and we wandered off away from the crowds and the horses."

My wife and I loved climbing up its many (steep!) sets of stairs to enjoy gorgeous panoramic views of Lisbon and the river below, and we spent almost 3 hours touring this beautiful landmark on a sunny May morning.We loved the friendly resident cats sunbathing in the grass, who were all too happy to let my wife pet them. And the beautiful flock of peacocks roaming the premises made for a fun and almost surreal environment.We liked the periscope in the Tower of Ulysses which incredibly showed live 360 degree views of the entire city. It was unbelievable to watch pedestrians walking and cars driving all over the city as projected into our dark room from the periscope above. This 20 minute presentation was a great overview of the various neighborhoods and sites of Lisbon, and was perfect since we spent our first few hours in Lisbon visiting the castle.I strongly recommend visiting this castle on your first day in Lisbon. Other than perhaps the wonderful attractions in Belem, there is nothing even remotely comparable in Lisbon from a sight seeing perspective."

The Castle has a 7,50 euro entrance fee per person. It had been used by the Romans, the Visigoths, and the Moors and served as a Moorish royal residence until captured by the first king of Portugal in 1147, with the help of Northern European Crusaders on their way to the Holy Land. Most of the castle was destroyed over the years, but the millennium old walls remain. Inside we climbed stairs and then walked along the ramparts where we had magnificent views of Lisbon. To our surprise, the food in the cafe inside was very good. You can eat outside if the weather is nice, or eat inside. We enjoyed a very nice lunch and photographed a strutting peacock who demonstrated what it means to be \u201cproud as a peacock.\u201d The peacocks alone might make the visit to the Castle worthwhile, but other than that there is little to see inside other than the walls and the view of Lisbon."

Getting there is an adventure -- we chose to ride two different trams to get to the top of the hill, pausing to wander around the interesting and historic neighborhoods in a tight, hilly district with lots of stairs, slopes, and interesting buildings. Be forewarned, even if you take the tram to the nearest stop, there is still an uphill walk of a few blocks just to get to the ticket office, which is outside the gates to the castle. The entrance plaza after the castle gates has wonderful views of the city of Lisbon, from the waterfront, across the orderly streets of Baixa, and up to the hills and parks in the distance. This is the perfect spot for a family photo with Lisbon as the backdrop.The walkways along the cliff are rough cobblestones, so be careful of your steps. En route to the castle structure, you'll pass a restaurant, coffee shop, and toilets. There are also many peacocks wandering around.The castle itself is mostly outdoors, with many walls and battlements to climb. Again the views from all sides are excellent. Most of the steps have proper railings, but they require caution while climbing and children should be kept close.One thing not to miss -- there is a ~20 minute show using a camera obscura in one of the buildings up in the castle tower. This camera projects a large, 360 degree view of the city with live action onto a large circular table inside a room. A staff member highlights the key sites, which was very interesting for us to see and understand.We spent about 1.5 hours at the site, and could have spent more if we were not in a hurry to see other sites.

Took tram 28 and made my way to Miradouro de Santa Luzia to take in the views before going to the castelo. Be warned that the path to the castelo can be a little hard to figure out as the signs to the narrow winding streets can be misleading. Upon arriving at the castelo it was confusing as to where you purchase the ticket. I noticed many people back tracking to the information/ticket booth. I have to admit I was a little surprised when I entered and realized the castelo is empty inside. There really isn't much more than the walls. You can walk on the walls and the 360 degree views of Lisbon from the top of the walls are incredible and make it all worthwhile.I would recommend a visit just for the views alone."

It is quite a bit of a walk to get to the castle (which in itself is quite lovely) but bear with it and you will not be disappointed.This is a Moorish castle, which was originally built back in the 8th century. Later on in the middle ages, a new section was added which is on top of the highest hill, with breathtaking views of the city. For over a thousand years the castle has been staring over the city, housing from solders to royals and kings and now tourists.Tip:- Check out the romantic gardens. There are peacocks walking around.- The restaurant is pricy but the food is ok. - If you have vertigo, be very careful when climbing to the top as it will feel as if you are on edge of the world. And the low railings don't help."

The citadel also comprises a living quarter for city officials (now in ruins), a palace (now a restaurant), ancillary buildings and a large terraced square.The origin of the present castle is uncertain but the bulk probably dates from the Moorish occupation and already existed in 1147 when Lisbon was conquered by Alfonso Henriques. The structure was modified later on.The castle got its name in the fourteenth century. King Joao I married Philippa of Lancaster and signed the auld alliance with the English. In honor of his new allies the castle got the name of their patron saint.The south and east side of the castle are protected by a (nowadays dry) moat. The north and west side are sealed off by steep hills.The current main entrance is not original. The original entrance lies in the east and brings the visitor into a barbican. Attackers had to follow this long and narrow corridor with their right flank under constant fire from defenders.Finally they reached a second gate placed opposite a wall (through which the current main entrance is pierced) to prevent the use of a battering ram.Once past this gate they came into a small space with a third gate, entirely enclosed by walls and thus under fire from all sides.Eventually they ended up in the courtyard which is divided into two sections that could be defended separately.The castle has no keep and no living quarters. There are only walls and towers. This is because it served as a last refuge in time of war.Although altered in later centuries the current structure is very impressive in size and atmosphere. Visitors can climb the walls and towers and are rewarded with beautiful views of the area.A big setback however is the total lack of information about the history of the castle and its architecture. You only get a leaflet with a map and there are a few signs. No audioguides or guidebooks are available.Sometimes there are free guided tours. Our guide was very amiable but the tour had a duration of only twenty minutes and gave us very little insight into the castle."

She walked us nearly to the front gate while providing a bit of side history! Love the locals! The castle offered the best view of the city. However, the castle is just an old castle that gave another 20 to 30 feet more elevation above the lower cannon platforms. On its grounds was a modest museum of artifacts found from its premises. Overall, the views of Lisbon justified the jaunt to the castle. My only regret? Although I intended to revisit after dark, each night we were too tired to do so...."

There is a small exhibit that tells the story of the castle and a gift shop of course.However, the bus/tram thing that takes you up to the castle stops fairly early. We walked back down the hill to the center of the city after hanging at the castle a little too long. I enjoyed the walk but I think my travel mates were a little uncomfortable. The area seems a little seedy at night."

We took the tram (E 12) up from Pr.Figueira and explored all around the castle and the grounds on a beautiful sunny morning. You can gain a great sense of the layout of the city and there are innumerable photo opportunities. Not having a good head for heights I must admit to feeling quite uncomfortable on a couple of occasions on the castle walls but there wasn't actually any real danger providing you exercised sensible caution. If you're visiting Lisbon you've got to do it really."

Take the time, if you can, to take a long walk through the neighbourhood - the windy streets are great for exploring. There is an admission fee for the castle, but it's quite reasonable in comparison to anywhere else in Europe. I recommend taking a packed picnic and just sitting in the park at the top and admiring the view - it's really quite panoramic. If you can, make sure you catch dinner in the old inner city at one of the many restaurants nestled on the stairs - the view back up to the castle all lit up at night is breathtaking."

I took a little bus (#37) up the steep hill and that was an adventure on its own. At times it seemed that it would be impossible for the driver to make a tight turn, at other times the ascent was so steep I thought we might be asked to push. But we got to a stop just outside the main entrance and wandered past a couple of brave artists who had their wares draped across the sidewalk on this drizzly day.Once inside the castle there are a number of look off spots offering great views of the city, the river and the statue of Christ on the south banks of the Tagus. You can poke around in old fountains, semi-submerged walkways and ancient courtyards. There is lots of statuary from various centuries, old gates, cannons and other artefacts to discover. And if you're lucky, the peacocks will be putting on a display.This is a place to head to if you have tired of the hustle & bustle of the city. There are lots of corners where you can claim a bench, haul out your book and settle back for some serious quiet. If you're traveling with kids, you can safely let them explore and discover."

Be wary of the pigeons roosting in the trees by the casual snack restaurant. We were enjoying ice cream when we got hit by a pigeon. Had to toss the ice cream cone and go clean up.

My husband and I, along with another couple, visited the castle in March and although nothing was really negative, we didn't feel like it was much to write home about. The views, as other reviewers have noted, were fabulous. You could see for miles in about every direction! The castle itself though was only so-so. It seemed over-restored to the point where it lost some of its history. The market place inside the walls sold over-priced, kitschy wares and detracted from what charm might have been. The exploring was fun though and the photo opportunities were plenty. My husband, who hadn't ever been to a castle before, thought it was great. I've been to tons of castles though and was less impressed. However, a few days later he recanted his opinion about Sao Jorge after we visited the amazing castle in Sintra.Overall, I say go see the castle if you aren't going to be able to get to any other castles on your trip. But if you plan on seeing any others, this one could probably be skipped - there are other places around town that also offer amazing vistas free of charge. Another thing to note is that we were in Lisbon at a fairly low tourist time and this place was the only sight we saw that had crowds - I can't imagine it in the summer."

Instead of a arduous climb up to the Castle, take Tram 28 (heading East) from Rua da Conceicao and alight at the Santa Luzia stop. Alternatively, one could alight in front of the Cathedral (Se) and do a short walk up to the miradouro. In this manner, you can save your energy for the short climb to the castle gate. One can explore the Alfama neighborhood on the way downhill. Be warned that the path to the Castle can be hard to figure out as the signs to the narrow winding streets can be misleading. The castle ruins itself does not offer much to look at. Also, the site is not well sign-posted with information or maps. There are however good views over Lisbon from the castle ramparts, e.g. one could even see Praca do Commercio.

The Castle itself is defiantly worth seeing. Entrance 5 euros per adult. Amazing views all along from the castle walls over Lisbon. Enjoy and relax in the gardens with an ice cream as they provide shade from the heat in mid-summer and see if you can spot the pea cocks.I do not recommend climbing the steps up towards the tower if you are getting on in years. My thighs were quiet sore afterwards and all I could think of was that both our sets of parents would not have been able to climb the often uneven terrain. Wear good walking shoes, sun screen and a hat if you visit in summer. Wonder around the neighbourhood when you leave the site. It is charming to see the streets and buildings. Be very careful of the restaurants outside the Castle as they are waiting for tired and hot tourists to lure into their establishments. Avoid at all costs and rather walk down further from the attraction. Better food and value for money.Thoroughly enjoy the excursion to Castelo de Sao Jorge!"

The Castelo really does provide some of the best views of Lisbon from the Esplanade, definitely beating the sight from the top of the Elevador de Santa Justa. Climbing the ramparts and towers are another highlight.I absolutely agree with the last reviewer on both points made - the site is not disabled access friendly, and I would not advise a visit to the Castelo for those with mobility issues, there are limited ramps, and only the Esplanade would be accessible to those with wheelchairs. The ramparts can only be reached via steep and narrow stairs, which can be especially precarious to climb when wet.Also, the site is not particularly well sign-posted with information about what you might be viewing, and a castle map is not offered either freely or for sale at the ticket office which was a disappointing surprise!! No audio guides here, either.Other thoughts... The on-site cafe-restaurant serves hot food as well as snacks, reasonably priced, but nothing special. There is also a well stocked and inexpensive souvenir shop offering higher quality, quirky, modern and well-designed items which you cannot find in other gift stores in the neighbourhood.I would recommend combining a trip to the Castelo with a wander around the adjacent area of Alfama - colourful and labyrinthine it provides a glimpse of 'local life' and also has some hidden gems for places to eat!"

I asked at the ticket desk if there was a tour, which I was told there was and to register at the museum but there was no one at the museum to register with and at 10 minutes past the tour start time I finally tracked down a museum employee who told me that they only ran if there were 10 or more people. (In my head I am thinking, well if no one is there to register with and you are not advertising a tour then there are never going to be 10 people signed up to take the tour). We left after having a coffee, which was very reasonably priced given the tourist trap, but a little disappointed we couldn't get more out of our visit. It is a real shame the Lisbon tourist people can't get it together to organise even a self guided tour with those headset things as this could be one of the best tourist attractions if only a little more thought went in to what people might want to get out of a visit."

But, when I tried to find it to visit it, I got hopelessly lost. Do not trust the signs that are posted around and just ask someone how to get there! When you enter the castle walls, there's a small community of homes and shops inside. I'm not sure how I would feel having tourists tromping through my backyard all day every day, so I left that area alone. The cost to enter is about $10 (or about 7 euro). The line was long but moved quickly and the folks selling tickets and souvenirs appear to speak every major European language as well as English. The castle isn't much to look at. You can walk along the walls (be careful -- an older woman came crashing down the stairs while I was there and was banged up pretty bad) and look out over the city, but that's about it. There was a man playing guitar in the central square area. If you wander away from the crowds, you'll find the archeological ruins dig area, where they are excavating some Moorish and Iron Age communities. I enjoyed the shaded castle grounds the most. It was a hot day and it was nice to enjoy a cold soda under a shade tree. Know that it's a good uphill climb to get to the castle entrance; if your feet can't take the cobblestones in Alfama, this climb won't feel too good and you may want to take a cab. There's a cafe there if you're hungry or need a drink. Not much for the kids to look at but it is a good view over the city."

It gives you a nice view of the city and coastline for some pictures. It was hard to walk to, lots of steep hills and odd small streets, so those that aren't as adventurous may want to just take a taxi."

I was very surprised by how good it then was and was very happy that I did not miss it. I can see how people are expecting a castle to go into and see rooms, furniture, etc, but this is still far better then many ruins I have seen elsewhere.Although people recommend taking the Tram, it is an easy walk up several blocks from the city center. If you do this, do stop by the Se Cathedral. The castle was quite large with much to explore, we first walked around the outer terrace and easily made amazing pictures of the city - made great with a cannon or castle walls in the foreground. We then went into the inner castle courtyards and climbed the walls to get an amazing 360 degree walk around and views in every direction. My kids just loved exploring the castle and we only left after 1.5 hrs as it was closing early being December.On my list of things to do in Lisbon, this ended up being at the top of the must-see list."

Would definitely be too dangerous for children as there are alot of heights with no barriers. The views from the castle are good but once you see one view from there, the rest look the same. The walk up to the castle is pretty but steep - not wheelchair friendly. We went up to try and enter the castle to be turned around to go back and buy tickets at a little shop (you'd miss it only for the huge queues outside the door). I didn't see any attractions worth mentioing apart from the Panoramic camera viewing room which wasn't working although they were still allowing people in to sit in a dark room with the out of order piece of equipment. Also beware of a restaurant near the tram stop on the square under all the tress. We were overcharged on lunch for things like bread and olives which we didn't even get. I only discovered this when I got a portugese speaker to translate the bill afterwards."

The views of the city are good, but other than that there isn't much else to see outside a half hour walking through the castle. However, if you take tram 28 up to the castle there are a lot of little shops and restaurants to check out."

We took the Tram 28, got off at the cathedral stop in Alfama & walked up. The view from here gives you a good perspective of the city. On our walk down we spent more time in Alfama before returning on Tram 28 to downtown. Tram 28 is a great attraction just for it self! Since Alfama has many good Fado clubs, you can check some out & return in the evening like we did to enjoy one. You can take the blue metro line to St Apolonia and walk over to Alfama in the evening."

I was so happy we went in the later afternoon, so it was not so hot.The castle itself offers amazing views of the city and great pictures. There was a man playing guitar in the middle courtyard, making a wonderful ambiance around the towers' lookout points. Tired tourists were sleeping in the grass, old men were playing cards around stone tables, and there were caf\u00e9s inside the castle grounds.I was dissapointed that there was not much to explain the history of the place- just a sign at the beginninng. Lots of stairs and the trek up to the castle insured that I was sore the next day, but it was a wonderful way to see the city and a fun walk. On the way to the castle, we passed a small place to eat that was real gem: creative munu, fresh ingrdients, freshly made papaya juice. It was across from an outdoor bar by a huge patio with couches overlooking the city."

It's a medieval castle, obviously there isn't going to be much to see of the castle itself in terms of decorations or furnishings!! It's a castle, not a palace... there's a difference. I loved the history and the spectacular view of Lisbon, it's breathtaking! Looking at those olive trees around the castle that are probably 1000's of years old is incredible. Also you can go up the steps to the castle to get an even better view... it's huge so there's lots to look at. Next time I go back to Lisbon I will definitely be returning to Castelo S\u00e3o Jorge. Definitely worth visiting at least once, even if it's just for the history alone that you don't get in North America."

You can walk all the walls and climb the towers, with nary a guardrail in sight - which makes it a lot of fun for castle-lovers. Non-castle buffs can stroll the lower levels but there isn't a lot to see of the castle itself.Don't miss the weird mirror-ball-video inside one part of the castle near the cafe! I've never seen anything like it!It was 5 euros well-spent, and took just over an hour to see every nook and cranny."

We booked it through Tablet hotels and having used the website before to book many other great hotels was expecting this to be pretty good.The staff were lovely and freindly and went out of their way to suggest local acitivites and good nearby restaurants. The common facilities - i.e the outdood courtyard, the rec room and honesty bar are all fab. We were less than impressed by our bedroom which was tiny, without natural sunlight and located under a stairwell. We asked to be moved but seeing as the hotel was fully booked the only other hotel we were offered was directly above the one we had and was the same size and located on the stairwell.We managed to see into some of the other rooms which looked great but you should really make sure that you get a room facing onto the coutryard so that you have more light and a nicer view."

We found it ironically amusing though, the render is coming off in chunks, clearly ancient building methods remain superior!Whether we were just unlucky or whether the people running the castle really do have absolutely no taste I don't know. When we visited (13th May) there was an awful kind of flea market/fete thing going on, there were 'tents' everywhere selling all manner of tat. Music varying from reggae to shrill female vocalist was booming from various directions. It was a real cheek to charge an entry fee. We just took our pictures of the Lisbon views and left!There are equally good views of Lisbon to be had if you walk around the backstreets, it's cheaper and more authentic!"

There is an admission fee to see the castle, but what they don't tell you is that there isn't really much more than the walls. The castle is empty inside. The signs say there are several attractions, exhibits etc. but when we went all but one was closed for repairs, and the remaining one (a camera obscura that projects the city view on the walls inside one of the castle rooms) required visitors to sign up for entry, but it was unclear just where you do that. We were given no indication that the few attractions that existed were closed, and the office merrily charged us full price. The most interesting thing in the castle was a slightly cracked Brit dressed in a tunic playing folk songs on a recorder. Wandering through the area, you'll see an unusual number of feral cats prowling around - turns out there are about 30 of them, and they all belong to this guy. The music added a certain amount of ambience to the barren castle, as did the cats. Other than that it was kind of a waste of time.Earlier in our trip we had gone to Obidos, a real medieval town with no admission fee and much more to see. Like Castelo Sao Jorge, you can climb up to the walls and walk the perimeter, but the stunning views are of rolling countryside, and within the walls there's a living city. Granted, most of the restaurants and businesses thrive on tourist dollars, but overall it was a much nicer experience."

That's right, it's reconstructed \"medieval.\" That's ok - except no where can you tell what was reconstructed and what is original. There are also no signs or anything that give you any history about the castle, where you are standing, what different areas had been used for. I don't mean I couldn't read the signs, I mean there weren't any. The pamphlet is nothing more than a map, and a skimpy one at that. The views of the city were great, however, but otherwise, there was not much to hold interest. After a little while you're just like \"yep, there's another wall.\" It's sad - it doesn't seem like it would take much effort to make the place a lot more interesting."

I never would have thought it, and I've been to a lot of the most well-known castle countries, but Portugal has amazing castles! Castelo Sao Jorge in Lisbon is no exception.It's clean, well-maintained, full of history, offers breathtaking views of the city and the river, and it's pretty easy to get to. At first I was dismayed because there's not a subway stop nearby, but it really isn't a very long walk from the closest stop. It's right off the Alfama district, which is not conducive to tunneling. You'll want to walk around the Alfama anyway, so the Castelo is a great addition to your day.There was a small entry fee, which was well-worth it considering how well-maintained the place was. Be sure to check out the camera obscura (a small, dark room where a hole in the ceiling projects a live image of the city onto a big dish). I think they give the presentations in both Portuguese and English. I ended up in a Portuguese one, and even though I don't understand Portuguese very well, it was still worth it.Highly recommended!"

Ok, first thing to be sure you know is that the tour guide you might have will tell you \"we have to walk to the top because the bus can't go to the top\" to get to the castle. Well, yes, it is true that a large tour bus cannot navigate the narrow streets to the top, but it is literally a 15 - 25 minute walk straight uphill on uneven cobbled street (many of which need to be repaired and make for treacherous footing)....but after we struggled to the top to see this castle, we saw a tram go by and lots of taxis. Do yourself a favor and take the tram or a cab to the top ...it will make your experience more enjoyable, especially if you are not in climbing shape, smoke, elderly, overweight...you get the picture. The view of Lisbon from this vantage point is spectacular, but not if you've been traumatized by the climb to get there!"
