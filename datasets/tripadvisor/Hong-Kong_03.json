I can tell you I am reluctant to share knowledge about this spot for that reason. Woolamaloo Prime in The One is one of those little treasures in Tsim Sha Tsui on Nathan Road. It is a high rise restaurant with a small balcony and an absolutely fabulous view over Victoria Harbour from the Kowloon side.High rise restaurants and bars are pricey of course but this one is a special spot. I just hope no one reads my review because my experience was on a Saturday afternoon and it was quiet, peaceful and very relaxing with good service and a view to die for.Getting there involves going to the lift lobby in The One on Nathan Road - The One is visible from afar! Then taking the lift to the 27th floor.So, if you looking for a new view of the Hong Kong skyline, this one might just meet your expectations of a great place to have a drink and a meal."

A visit during the day, in my opinion, is just as impressive as one made during the night. Although you won't be able to see the buildings in all their multi-colour glory, you will still get a good view, have fewer people to contend with and won't have to fight for a decent vantage point from the shoreline.That said, a visit at night is worth the time as long as you aren't situated too far away. The A Symphony of Lights show, for me, was a little underwhelming although the atmosphere and infectious music from the Tsim Sha Tsui viewpoint is pleasant enough despite the crowds.A hike to The Peak will offer a view of the skyline from a different angle altogether. Unfortunately terrible weather put paid to my planned hike but photographs shown to me by friends who stayed in Hong Kong a few days longer than me proved the journey to be worthwhile and the views suitably impressive. I was sad to have missed out!"

The harbour should be viewed at night with all the lights, it is something that you should not miss, there is a light show at 8pm each night and well worth seeing, if you are able to go to the top of a tall building you will get some great photos of the harbour at night and also during the day, it is a must see if you are in Hong Kong, I have seen it many times and love seeing the view each time i am in Hong Kong."

Across the Harbor there is a jungle of concrete, tall skyscrapers that switch on their colorful lights upon the falling dusk, the Peak and a chain of crests that run though Hong Kong Island from East to West.Of course, you can jump on the Star Ferry between Tsim Sha Tsui and Central or Wanchai. But the best option, which will give you wide and panoramic pictures, is to take the New World First Ferry between North Point (Hong Kong Island) and Hung Hom (Kowloon Side). It runs between 0700 and 1900. Come after a storm or a typhoon when the skies are clean, and you will enjoy a limitless range of grays, blues and greens.If you like the crowd and have a massive amount of patience, come here and enjoy the fireworks that are launched for Chinese New Year! That will leave you speechless."

We arrived at the harbour front about an hour before the light show and waited for what we thought would be spectacular. It wasn't worth the wait - it's good and worth seeing and maybe it was the weather but certainly not a must see. Better just getting the Star Ferry across at night or the or the Victoria Peak tram during the day."

Best seen from The Avenue Of The Stars on Kowloon side or from the Star Ferry, it never fails to impress. Another good way to see it in all its glory is to take a taxi from Causeway Bay towards Central and the vie is magnificent along parts of the journey. And don't forget the evening light show where all the buildings are lit up and synchronised by computer - the show lasts about 10 minutes and takes place daily and is free.

The Hong Kong skyline is gorgeous but seeing it from the Avenue of Stars where its crowded and theres heaps of tourists is a bit overrated.Instead, I'd recommend finding the outdoor carpark in Ocean Terminal on the 6th floor (ocean terminal is a huge shopping centre). Go out into the carpark and walk all the way to the carpark's perimeter. From there you can get equally good views of the harbour, and you can usually get it all to yourself! Either that, or I like going up to the top of buildings to see the skyline. The American Club in Hong Kong has an excellent view of the skyline, probably the best I've seen. I watched the new years fireworks from there. Without already knowing people, it's difficult to get access into a lot of the tall buildings in Central where you might be able to see the skyline, but the carpark I mentioned above is accessible to everyone and is free.Enjoy!"

We were lucky enough to stay at the Intercontinental hotel that has an amazing view of this iconic skyline.I would recommend travelling on the Star Ferry during the light show that starts at 20.00 for a great view. The buildings light up and it is a very exciting visual display, every night.Also recommended go to Victoria peak and experience the view from another perspective. If it is a clear day , the photographs are spectacular."

What surprised me the most, was the discovery of a different view from the \"dark side\" as the HK white expats call it meaning Kowloon (less white folks?). High up from the mountain off Clear Water Bay. The view was breathtakingly beautiful, better than Victoria harbour view!

Even while you are in the Star Ferry, take a look around and see the fabulous views. Once you are on the Kowloon side, take a walk up and down the Harbour. Also, go to Harbour City Mall which is very close to the Star Ferry pier. Walk through that mall and you'll see some nice views of the city. Be sure to go to the Kowloon side during the day and then at night to get very different views of the city. Night time is incredible looking at all of the flashing lights."

Either way, I strongly suggest, weather permitting, you view it outside from the Kowloon side of the harbor at a location that also plays the music. I would think that they play music next to the Star Ferry."

The shapes and contrasts of the various buildings fit together like a crazy jigsaw and when you add in the way that the buildings are lit and how that sits against the night sky create something that is truly unique, whether you are at street level or 118 floors up at the Ritz Carlton Hotel overlooking the harbour, the Hong Kong skyline is something that has to be seen to be believed."

I love when at night you see the lights of the tall buildings just fading off into the distance. Cool how certian buildings have an impressive lighting display at night, and then add to that when the Symphony of Lights commence each night. Yes it gets crowded the closer you get to the Star Ferry Terminal when watching the Symphony of Lights but there is no way anyone person can block your view, especially when the view is so huge and high. Don't bother watching it from the top of the Peak, because you won't see much of the light show, plus you won't get the narratives and music you get from the Kowloon side."

You need to change at central and then from central, you walk to the tram stop which is about 7 minutes walk from the station. At the tram station, there were about 300-500 people waiting to catch the tram and some people also waiting to buy tickets. We bought a combo ticket at the tram station which included admission into madam Tussaud, the sky tower and return tram tickets $320 HK approximately.After buying the combo tickets, you get to skip some of the queue a little bit but you still have to wait about 20 minutes before getting on the tram. The tram ride is around 5 minutes or so long. Once you get to the top, you walk through to an indoor markets which sells souvenirs and rubbish like that. There are also some food outlets, littleRestaurants and takeaway stores. arrived at the peak building at 5:30pm.I then spent about 40 minutes in madam tussauds which I thought was better than the Sydney one. Then I made my way up and had a quick meal on the 5th floor. After that I went up the escalators all the way to the top floor. By the time I got to rhe top, it was 6:40pm which was good because it was still daylight. I was able to take a professional daylight photo and also another night time photo at 7:30. From 6:30-7:30 I watched the sunset so I think this is a good time to go because you get to see both views during the day and night. It started to get quite crowded with people pushing each other trying to get photo of the view. I finally the sky tower building at around 8:30 and joined the queue to get onto the tram. The wait for the tram was 30 minutes long.The views were beautiful and spectacular. Highly recommend you go and go at 6:30pm to watch the sunset and see the view during the day and at night."

Three places I would recommend outside of the normal tourist haunts are as follows:1. Bowen Road: Used by most locals as a walking/jogging track. No cars whilst we were on this 5-6km stretch high on the hill. We got access off Kennedy Road. Great views of HK and a level and easy walk once you get up to it.2. Woolloomooloo Open Air Bar on the 32nd floor ofThe Hennessy Building around Wan Chai/Causeway Bay Area. Very little advertising, but locals know it. Great views and good cocktails. Beware the rain as not much cover available. There was s a steak house by the same name in this building also. We just went to the bar.3. Cafe Gray Deluxe in the Upper House Hotel. Floor 42. A luxurious way to take in the harbour and skyline. We just St went for drinks nos and they allowed us to book a table. Beautiful staff.Enjoy the views of HK."

Sure it was nice, sure lights went on and off and lasers moved around. But it was really just so-so to my family. We've seen spectacular light shows before and this one in June 2016 just didn't make the grade.It was also a little painful having to listen to the promotional talk and advertising re the show and participants. I understand they want some promotion but I wasn't expecting that."

The lights painting the sky is really good, synched with the chinese music they stream through speaker all over the coasts, you can see a surprisingly good show. And for free.. of course it can improve a lot, but well, it's such a good show. I loved it"

I could stare all evening out of my window sipping away wine witnessing the amazing view. Please get this view by paying extra as it's truly worth it . Also this amazing view is more fascinating from their roof top pool and gym on 9th floor which faces Victoria harbour!!! Definitely worth considering staying at hotel icon if you want to enjoy this fantastic once in a lifetime experience! !!"

It is prettier to seeing HK Island from the Kowloon waterfront, than the other way around. If cost is not an issue, stay at a Kowloon TST area hotel facing the harbour. Your harbour view room is worth the extra $$ as you can have drinks in your room every night and enjoy the best harbour view at night in the World."

Get all tickets information, riding schedule and location at the Hong Kong Tourist office at Star Ferry. The double decker Tram ride from the very north of Hong Kong to the very south near Kennedy Town for peanuts. You can get on any tram stops and you'll never forget this experience for the rest of your life. Remember ride on the upper deck. Good luck! Dinner or lunch at the Jumbo Dragon Boat restaurant at Aberdeen. It's sea food at its best. You can choose the live fish before they cook it for you anyway you like. The place is like a sea Palace on a dragon boat, it is a little pricy but worth every Penny. You'll find mostly the locals eating here and you can also get their famous Dim Sums. Getting there is a little tricky but you can take any bus or taxi to Aberdeen and ask the boat ride that will get you to the Kumbo FREE!"

Either side of this, you have to put up with the (boring??) lightshow on the various HK Island builds that light the night sky. It's the corporate or business equivalent of Las Vegas, with globally known brands grabbing your attention as the light the night sky.Best viewed from Kowloon Star Ferry Port and towards the Intercontinental Grand Stanford."

We did manage some good photos despite the haze though.It is difficult to compare or rave about this show but it is undoubtedly part of the Hong Kong experience. Architecturally the actual sky line has much merit but given that it is just an over populated city which has grown and grown we found it hard to excited about it. But having said that it will not be something we forget easily either."

After your visit, you could take the tram down the mountain and get to central.The second place is at the Avenue of Stars at Tsim Sha Tsui. It's gonna be a romantic walk along the shore with the spectacular light shows in Central reflected in the river. The third place is at the 360 view deck at ICC at West Kowloon. You could reserve for a afternoon tea / dinner there and enjoy the panorama with your loved one. I brought my boyfriend to dinner at this place and we had a great time. It's pretty cold inside though, just like anywhere else indoor in HK. Oh wait, the food is not that great considering the price, and you usually need to book weeks ahead to secure a place.Let's get back to the skyline... the best skyline I've ever visited is the one in Shanghai!

Great at all times of the day or night but obviously best without the haze.At night it is great to get the star ferry as you have amazing views. A lovely relaxing view, and on Sundays, many of the local art schools sit on the TST promenade to paint the skyline which is always interesting.The light show is best when it is not christmas time/chinese new year, as the buildings on the skyline have their own lights during these times, which detracts from the light shows, as the show does not stand out as obviously.A great skyline, only rivalled by Shanghai, the bund. Also Singapore but thats a bit different in style."

Watch the lights and lasers from the Harbour City shopping mall - as good a view as from a harbour cruise. Look out for the remaining junks with red sails, lit up at night. The wattage is phenomenal.

There is a program every night that involves lighting waterfront buildings and adding sound starting around 8pm the day we were in town. They mix various kinds of LED, flood lights and green lasers.It's free and interesting, but not as exciting in my mind as a great fireworks display. One of the problems in HK is that the humidity and air pollution limit the number of days when you can actually see the other side of the harbor. When a good day finally arrives, there is a lot of pent up demand and the crowds make it hard to get a good view. In our 7 days in HK, we had only one day when the air was clear. The crowd on the Kowloon side (probably the better views are from Kowloon) were 6 to 10 deep and about every other person had a selfie stick for their camera. PLan on being at the waterfront an hour before the show.The show runs around 12 minutes. I expected a better light display, so my wife and I are probably in the minority that this is overrated."

Alternatively, you can admire it from a walk along the promenade along Tsim Sha Tsui East, which is free. However, summer nights can be a bit hot and humid."

This depends on your budget fitness and inclination. These are Hong Kong skyline tips. This depends also on the weather, but even if it is misty it can be spectacular. The key to HK skyline is to experience it through different forms of transport at different times of day with different weather conditions. The Star Ferry of course, the tram along Hennessy Road, by bus and by foot you will see it from different angles. 1. If you can afford it do take a harbour view room in your hotel. This can be in the Mandarin Oriental or the Harbour View depending on your budget. Just sit watching from your room. The Grand Hyatt has excellent Harbour Sunsets. 2. Take the double decker bus 15 to the Peak from Central (sit on the right upper deck but half way up, swap if you can) or the 6 to Stanley, the glimpses of the skyline are magnificent. 3. Walk over Violet Hill from Repulse Bay if you are fit and Jardine's Lookout (less strenuous). 4. At the Peak, if it is clear find your way up to the Governors Walk and don't just do the standard circuit. 5. There is no end of places to drink and eat and enjoy the views of city, sea and hills! If you don't have a lot of money, then bars on the tops of ferry piers can be fun. Cafe Deco on the Peak has great food and skyline views. "

The skyline of Hong Kong is surrounded by mountains and the Victoria Harbour. The tour guide emphasised the \u2018Symphony of Lights named by the Guinness Book of World Records\u2019 as the largest permanent light and sound festival in the world. A tour in cruise to enjoy the Victoria Harbour is organised. We did not dare to participate as we are senior citizens. But we could interact with few who enjoyed on the previous day.

It is remarkable how the citizens changed their small fishing village to be \" Pearl of the Orient.\" I have watched that Skyline over the past fifty years. It has, of course, changed. To start with, the Victoria Harbour is getting smaller and smaller as the city needs land and more and more \"reclaimation\" took place. I hope that I shall not live to see it becoming a fishing pond. It is not as neat as it used to be. Buildings are being pulled down for new ones but they don't match their predecessors. HK builders work tremendously fast. When the Prince of Wales was here opening another new building, he marvelled at the rate the building was finished. He mentioned that he was used to open new buildings started by his father and even his grandfather in Britain! I reccommend the evening, after seven. It is definitely less hot and the sea breeze is pleasant. The lightings are pretty although not not environmentally correct. For those who don't like walking for long stretches, there are evening ferries with guides telling you the buildings' names."

To name a few, some of the wonderful high architectures I have seen are the Burj Khalifa in Dubai which is the current tallest freestanding structure in the world, the Marina Bay Sands in Singapore which is one of its kind, the Petronas Twin Towers in Kuala Lumpur which is tallest twin towers in the world, the Empire State Building which is kind of old but still has its appeal. The Hong Kong skyline is as diverse as its culture and people. Some buildings are ultramodern like the One IFC, the Bank of China Tower and the International Commerce Center while some are classic and contemporary like the Hopewell Centre, the Jardine House and the Standard Chartered Bank Building. There are some good vantage view to appreciate the skyline of Hong Kong. One of it is the Tsim Sha Shui Promenade located in Kowloon across the Victoria Harbour and the Hong Kong Island where most of the the nice buildings of Hong Kong are located. Taking the Star Ferry is another way to appreciate the magnificent edifices of Hong Kong. The Star Ferry itself is one of Hong Kong's top attractions. If you want a view from top, the vista from the Victoria Peak or simply The Peak commands a panoramic sight of the totality of Hong Kong's skyline from across the Victoria Harbour, the Kowloon Peninsula to the architectural landmarks down the Victoria Peak in the Hong Kong Island. The Peak also has a peculiar transport which is the Peak Tram. The Peak Tram is also one of Hong Kong's famous things to do. Wherever you are and wherever you plan to go, marvel at the high man-made structures made to try to reach the sky. It is also serves a trophy for megacities to declare that they have the economic might and truly a global city."

By day you can see the many imposing buildings with the greenery of either the New Territories or that of Hong Kong Island behind them, depending on which side of the harbor you observe from. By night is when it becomes really impressive though. Consider taking a look from both the Hong Kong side and the Kowloon side, as each offers a little bit of a different perspective. From the Kowloon side, walk down to the end of Nathan Road and cross over to the area around the Hong Kong Cultural Center next to the Museum of Art. From here you get an excellent view of the island across the harbor, as well as all the lit up boats crossing in front of you. From the East Tsim Sha Tsui Waterfront Podium which now houses the iconic Bruce Lee statue, you can also get a great view, with the many colors of the buildings being reflected into the water at night. Then of course there is the view from the peak which is an awesome, all encompassing over look of the whole city before you. There are so many colors and patterns going on, and the light show is interesting. It is worth the admission and wait to get up to the peak for this view."

We sat in the outdoor area of the Eye Bar (rooftop), Kowloon CBD, from about 5:30 pm - 8:30 pm, watching the skyline change as darkness set in. One by one, the buildings lit up and the skyline transformed into a neon vista. The light show that begins at 8 pm isn't the best neon light-show we've seen, but it was pretty cool to watch while making plans for dinner. Photos of the HK harbour by night do give a good representation of the view, it is stunning - but if you want to purchase a picture of that view, consider looking online, as they are enormously expensive in the local stores."

I've been to Hong Kong for both business and pleasure over the last 51 years and never cease to be enthralled by the vista of gleaming office towers and apartment blocks thrusting ever upwards and reflected in the now so-clean waters of Hong Kong Harbour. Views differ on what side of the harbour offers the best views but, in my opinion, it's a no-brainer. The Kowloon side looking over to the Peak, Wan Chai and Central winds hands down! Whether you take in the view from the Star Walk between the HK Museum of Art as you head toward the Star Ferry and the iconic Clock Tower, or take in the view from a bar in any of the elegant hotels facing the waterfront or actually on the waterfront, there's always something to see, The constant hustle and bustle of marine craft, tourist junks, the Star Ferries criss-crossing the harbour, tugs and the barges carrying the ever-present construction spill will keep you gazing with interest at the ever-changing spectacle. At night the office buildings cast a brilliant light on the water ('though economics and ecology dictate that they don't do so nearly so long as formerly) and a real bonus is the laser-light show beamed in to the night sky from the three tallest buildings on Hong Kong Island. The best thing? It's all free!"

The bus then crossed the bay via the tunnel and toured downtown Kowloon and then proceeded through Kowloon past things like night markets etcVery good but you miss the laser show.There is a fee for this as well.The second night we went from the foot of Nathan street to the harbour wall of Kowloon and joined the crowds to watch the skyline, see the local junk with its red sails take passengers for a sail and the watched and listened to the laser/music show of Hong kong island.The clearer the night, the better but enjoyable... and there is no cost."

A person could spend hours at night walking the piers and promenades of Kowloon and never stop taking pictures. Daytime is impressive in its own right, but nighttime is best.

Lots of streets around there were blocked off due to the Chinese New Year parade. As we crossed the subway to try to reach the harbour we came across the Harbour Tour. I think it's run by the same company as the ferry from Hong Kong to Kowloon. Well, we got the boat at 17:55, it was such a delight! It cost approx US$20.00 per adult and they only accepted cash so we got the cash out of an adjacent ATM. We could have not done any better. We got on quickly on a lovely 2 decker boat. Tables and chairs were like in a French brassiere stuck on the floor. They gave us a new year gift and a snack and a drink included in the ticket. The cruise was approximately 1 hour and we were there exactly at sunset. We loved it. Now we don't know wether this was just one off harbour tour on that particular Lunar New Year's Day or a regular thing. Perhaps a kind traveller can let us know that. If you come across it, it's well worth a trip. We took some beautiful pictures!!!"

Definitely take the Star Ferry from Hong Kong Island to Tsim Sha Tsui, then sit outside in the raised viewing area on the water's edge in front of the Cultural Centre and watch the sun go down behind the skyscrapers to the west of Central. You'll be mesmerised by the sparkling lights of the waterfront towers running eastwards all the way to North Point and the coloured light-show reflections in the harbour. Watch out for the boats plying the waters, the ferries and perhaps a red-sailed traditional junk. Great photo opportunities."

I went on a clear calm day and the floor still moved like on a boat, its initially scary when you look out and see 50 story sky scrapers that look like toys. the 360 degree views are literally stunning.

The drinks are somewhat pricy however I felt we got our value for money due to the quality of the drinks, the ambience of Ozone and not at least due to the very nice views of the bay area and the Hong Kong island. Ozone is supposedly one of the highest bars in the world, located on the 118th floor at the top of the Ritz Carlton hotel. There is a large outdoor patio which would cater for smokers.You should reserve a table if you intend to arrive later in the evening as I understand this place can get quite full."

At night, it becomes a magnificently incomparable sight to behold. There are other great skylines in the world like the New York, Toronto, Sydney skylines, to name a few, but nothing can compare to the Hong Kong skyline in terms of grandeur and beauty. It is really and definitely a sight to see and experience. One can see the multi storey office towers and multinational corporation headquarters from a great panoramic view. Taking the Star Ferry across the harbour will even provide the best way to see the Skyline. Junk boats (mainly for tourists) ply the harbour and a glimpse of the past contrasted against the modern skyscrapers will never be seen anywhere else. This is absolutely a must see attraction when visiting Hong Kong. And the beauty of it all, is that it is free for everyone to see. See it from the Kowloon side near the Star Ferry pier or behind the HK Cultural Centre. Enjoy the view!!!"

I thoroughly enjoyed the ferry from Hong Kong Island across to Kowloon. I wandered up to the Peninsula to have their famous high tea that didn't disappoint. At night the city is lit up with a million lights. Wonderful place."

Best views are from the Star Ferry or the Tsim Sha Tsui side of the harbour.

During a recent trip to Hong Kong I was on the waterfront at Kowloon and Hong Kong Island on more than one occasion , the buildings are even more impressive at night particularly over the Christmas period where several of them really go to town with their decorations. I had a birds eye view of the New Year's eve fireworks which was a brilliant show and well worth the mild discomfort of being jostled by the thousands of others doing the same thing. The nightly light show over the harbour is ok if you happen to be there but I wouldn't make special arrangements to see it although a women next to me was getting very excited , her exclamations of 'amazing'etc made me and my son very puzzled we couldn't see anything that would provoke this reaction."

It's impressive by any measure and its backdrop against Victoria peak and surrounding hills makes this not only an impressive urban landscape but also a natural spectacle. On a clear day you can easily appreciate how amazing this former British colony really is and when it is lit for special occasions (Christmas lights are the best) it is truly a marvel to behold. View it from the Kowloon waterfront or take the harbour ferry for a closer look. If you want a closeup sensation go to one of the many rooftop bars in central."

Let me start by saying that the skyline is visible from three promenades along the Kowloon bay, so you have to be on Kowloon side and not Hong Kong island side. The site for watching the laser show is next to Star ferry pier/ behind Hong Kong cultural center / end of Salisbury road, all are same locations. There is a 5 min laser lights display which is tuned to the music being played but compared to any descent musical light show this is not even noticeable. The crowd is way too dense and most parents lift their children up on shoulders and some are just using selfie sticks to record the proceedings. A better option to see the skyline is to visit it after the 0800 pm show when crowds have thinned out. Also there was a 3D show just behind the pier location at 0820 pm, 0845 pm and even more timings were there. Again you see children on shoulders and selfie sticks only. The show is nothing to write home about. Alternatively, you can see the skyline from East Tsim Tsa Sui promenade while having dinner at any of the swanky restaurants with live music."

The skyline can be enjoyed in many ways, but highly recommended is the view from a Star Ferry or from the Kowloon side boulevard. During daytime you can enjoy the outstanding (literally) architecture, and at night the buildings come alive with colorful lighting, including fully animated video on some buildings. There is a light show each evening at 8 visible from the Kowloon side, however it does not add much to the view as such."

Mixed hotels and businesses, tall, very tall and short buildings! Very diverse city with old and new intermingled. Lots of cultural things to see and learn about.Very busy city! Many people jammed up in a tiny area and it is best to do things early in the mornings but shopping malls only open at 10am. This is definitely a night life city! The buildings around Victoria Harbour at night are all lit up and there is even a night light show at 8pm each evening.This time if year everything inside and out is decorated beautifully for Christmas! A magical time of year to visit Hong Kong!"

Well, it's really quite a site at first, but once you look closely, few of the buildings are truly distinguished. Compare it to the significant buildings in Sao Paulo...the Copan, Hotel Unique, etc. Once you start to really see the massive apartmentdevelopments that most Hong Kong residents live out their life in, much of skyline is architecturally uninteresting, and a times drab. The vast housing estates are monotonous.A few unusual building dot the shores on both sides of harbor. Unusual, eye-catching but not always good buildings. Hong Kong has energetic land reclamation programs, which insure more undistinguished buildings will be blocking the ones presently along the water. Sorry to be the one who doesn't go along with the crowd on this. But do want to be on the level.The sum is more than the parts here. So don't look to closely."

The Hong Kong skyline was predominately dominated by the distinctive Bank of China tower ( the one with the triangular framing ) , the first building outside of North America to top out at over 1000ft. It held its distinction as the most recognizable building of Hong Kong throughout the 90s until a spur of growth as Hong Kong became to emerge as one the top financial centers in Asia.The skyline began to give way to even taller, grander buildings in the 2000s, in timing as China's economy began develop. I'm not the biggest fan of financial and banking cartels, but they sure do build some impressive work spaces for all to gawk upon as they stare down on the 99.99% from 100 story high builds. Never the less Hong Kong's skyline has become one of the worlds most impressive, even surpassing Manhattan's in terms of density and setting behind the mountains of Hong Kong Island.The best views are from the Avenue of Stars, the Star Ferry & from Victoria Peak. There is a nightly light show called Symphony of Lights in the evening but to many failed to live up what long exposure photos depict of the event. Watch it if it fits your convenience but its not worth it to go out of your way to catch."

I have been many times but the first time 40 years ago saw many junks plying their wares in the harbour but now there is not one. Many of the old shops and shopping streets have been torn down and replaced with high rise apartments. Prices are now equal to any other high end city. RIP old colonial Honkers"

Would we like the drapes open? I feel a Wow moment coming.Yes please and with one deft swich of multiple layers of beautiful fabrics the glimmering sparkle of HongKong's magnificent harbour is directly in front of us. Bestie is gob smacked.A full harbour view room ours to enjoy for a week.Skyline views to die for where's the champagne? Yes we have some and the ice bucket and two flutes will be right up! That cite sky scape never fails to impress.Loved it.The red sails of the junk drifts past nightly,the light show the spectacular fire works (who else knew we were coming?)

My experience to enjoy the Hong Kong Skyline view is from the Victoria Peak, commonly known as \"The Peak\". Our flight was 4pm out of HK, so after breakfast at 830am, we decided to take the nature walking trail up the Peak. Starting from MacDonnell Road and the Peak Tram Lane, we ascend the walking trail in steady pace by crossing Bowen Road onto Clovelly Path. Walk across May Road, we proceed to the nature walking trail (next to public toilet) up the Peak. The scenery of HK skyline transforms from close-up view of apartment buildings to sky scrapers and office towers crowding both shores of Victoria Harbor. Just enjoy this amazing view through the opening gaps between the tall trees along the trail. Walking along Barker Road towards the Peak, we finally reached the base of Peak's viewing tower in 45 minutes. After a short coffee break at Starbucks caf\u00e9, we decided to take a slow 45-minute walk around the Peak's tree-lined path and had the 360 degree panorama view of HK skyline unveil before us. After walking round the Peak, we took the 8-minute journey tram ride (fare HK28 per person) down and stop at MacDonnell. We get to experience a very pleasant walk up the Peak, enjoy the amazingly panoramic HK skyline and the tram ride all in just slightly 2 hours return!"

It takes a while for the immersive experience to sink in, so I recommend that you do not rush to go and leave. You should take things slowly and admire the marvellous view and let it all sink in. Unfortunately for us, because of the Halloween festivities, we didn't stay for very long since it was very crowded and noisy.

We went up around 4pm to see the daylight views, and stayed to watch the sunset and have a good view of the city lights, too. Wonderful evening trip! I'd also recommend visiting Red Bar in the IFC for another beautiful view over to Kowloon side from Central. There's also The Ritz bar in ICC which I would not recommend. It's overpriced ($HK100 a beer at the cheapest!) and, for us, the windows were so dirty you couldn't even see out. Perhaps we went on a bad day, but I can't imagine the view is any better here than from The Peak anyway. There's also a few other bars in Kowloon to view over to Central side, and a walk along the harbour will provide beautiful views, too."

The music lasted for about 10 minutes and a few green lasers beamed from the top of a couple of buildings. It was not the climax we expected but the illuminated buildings were the stars of the evening.There is a large viewing area on the Kowloon side but the seats and walls are hard to sit on for any length of time.

From there you can enjoy the skyline of building along the front of the Hong Kong island but also the lights from buildings along the slopes of the hills behind the coast line.

It has also successfully developed its economy through financial institutions and a vibrant retail sector. The result is a juxtaposition of skyscrapers forming mass housing and skyscrapers forming corporate Head Quarters, usually with major retail outlets on the lower floor. The housing is harsh utilitarian architecture, fit for purpose, but unlikely to win any awards. The commercial buildings, on the other hand, are innovative, imaginative and often exciting.But put together and add a liberal veil of heavily polluted air (most from mainland China) and you get one of the least appealing cityscapes in the world.My advise would be to view it at night. Somehow, the utilitarian skyscrapers appear to form a supporting canvas to the brightly lit commercial buildings. Take a look at my two photos and see which you prefer."

For a good view and good informal seat on TST Promenade, reach by 730pm.The HK Skyline by night is very pretty - all the famous buildings are brightly lit up. The light & sound show is a bit overrated - so its best to see on Day 1 if you want to unwind without doing any hectic sightseeing and retire early to be fresh to see the other bigger attractions from Day 2 of your tour.The narration is in Cantonese & English on alternate days - so if you are very keen to listen to English make sure you visit on the right day. However, as said earlier, it does not matter - we recommend you visit this on your day of arrival - the show is self explanatory - take some pics - walk on the promenade - enjoy it eating a softy and proceed to dinner and early bedtime - to get refreshed for some real sighseeing on Day 2."

Add $50HK and you'll have unlimited subway plus enough bus fare plus the Star Ferry back and forth to Kowloon, with change leftover.

Interesting to be provided with the background of many of the buildings on the Big Bus and Peak commentaries. These are so many building cranes as every day work continues to increase the number of skyscrapers in this area. We were told that over 50% of the world's cranes are being used in China at this point.Loved seeing the old building method of using bamboo scaffolding on construction of the lower parts of some buildings. At night the skyline is even more dramatic and beautiful."

There is a light and laser show daily at 8 pm which transforms the place into a colorful spectacle. This can get crowded especially during the weekends and holidays. I preferred to visit it early morning around 630 am when there was hardly anyone other than those enjoying their morning walks and exercise. Suggest you walk from the Avenue of Stars end to the clock tower end where you get the heritage Star Ferry to take you back to Hong Kong island. This would enable you get a feel of the harbour, the Peak in the distance and the skyscrapers saying \" welcome to HK\"."

Personally I think that although it is impressive, it lacks some of the character of cities like New York, but that is my personal view. You need to move around the island and get over to Kowloon so that you can see if from multiple angles"

From the Kowloon side star ferry pier turn right and go past the buses. Shortly after that you can see the perfect view of the harbour. Even better is to go up the stairs on the viewing platform if you are watching the light show. It does get busy so get there early as they close the viewing platform. I arrived just in time. I was on my own having just dropped off my girlfriend to get the train back to China. I had few hours to kill before I needed to get my flight so I decided to watch the light show. It's a good show and when the junk boat with the red sails comes past it looks like picture perfect postcard :-) To get a even better view you should use the star ferry. The journey lasts about 10 mins and is slow enough to get good pictures of both sides of the harbour."

To get a real picture of the scale of Hong Kong, sit on the left side of the boat when heading to Lantau Island. Endless tall buildings going right around the island. The quintessential shot of the skyline is obtainable from Kowloon waterfront, but if you're in the area, the front driveway of Ritz Carlton offers a pretty stunning view too! Finally, the peak gives great high views showing Hong Kong perched on its Island."

Its a showy display of the city and it belies a lot of the dirt of many of the highrise just behind it, but it seems they are go through a period of new construction where the older dirtier building are being replaced by new flashy ones. I thought it provides the perfect illustration to how busy the city was and the density of population. The light show was entertaining and was good to see with some drinks and a view.

During the day, it's kind of nice, but you're better off seeing it at night when the Symphony of Lights starts, 8pm.You can see it from the Avenue of Stars, or on the Harbour from a boat. Either way, you'll see the light show and hopefully get some great pics. My honest opinion of the light show is that it wasn't breathtaking, but it was still cool to experience. I watched it from a Victoria Harbour cruise boat, which itself was a hilarious experience. If you do the same cruise, head up and try to stand on the railing towards the bow of the ship, not the left or right. That way, once you start going and the show starts, you're in front, with the show ahead of you. Once the show has been going on for a bit, either of the sides will work too."

It could have helped if the place is stroller friendly and there is a small park for kids to be occupied while relaxing along the harbour. Our rambunctious kids play close to the edge of the harbour to keep them occupied while waiting for the Symphony of Lights. The Symphony of Lights happens at 8pm everyday. A laser and light show of skyscrapers of Hong Kong. Everyday, the show runs with different language. Unluckily , we were not able to watch the English version so we don't know what the story is. The weather was also gloomy so we didn't appreciate the laser much. During extreme weather conditions, the show is cancelled so be sure to check the thunderstorm alert in the area before waiting. My sisters think that the skyline is better viewed from the Hong Kong Island; the kids and I think that the view from the Kowloon side is way better. Try from both sides, either ways it's both spectacular skyline! A really must do when in Hong Kong"

Viewing spot was great, but the sound wasn't anywhere loud enough. It would be great to have a few more speakers set up to hear.Our night was quite cloudy, however this was good for the laser beams as we could see these well.We probably expected more than just the Central HK Island to be lit up. There were some fantastic lighting effects, but just not enough for the WOW factor!The myriad of boats on the harbour flitting back and forth does distract a bit, and when the big private ones moor just in front of you to pick up and drop off, it does alter the viewing available."

We didn't pay the extra to go up to the better viewing area. There is a huge shopping centre up here whith good toilets/food etc.We took the No. 15 bus up and the tram down, the bus trip was great, exciting but a little scary with great views. The tram down was disappointing, huge queues, crowded inside and you travelled down backwards so hard to see. There were limited views coming down on the tram, most being obscured by trees or buildings, next time I wouldn't bother with tram."

It's used as the backdrop for advertising, movies, tv etc. When folks visit HK, they're encouraged to park themselves across the harbour in TST to enjoy the evening light show. For my husband and I, the idea of having this amazing place as the backdrop for our recent wedding celebrations was too good to pass up - and during the entire day's adventure, which included a 4 hour private cruise around Victoria Harbour, the HK skyline delivered to promise."

The show on New Year's Eve is even better, although smoke from the fireworks sometimes obscure the details. Another must-see view is the Hong Kong skyline as viewed from The Peak on Hong Kong Island, which provides a scale and scope. The Kowloon skyline, during the day, can be viewed from the public garden at the top of the IFC (International Finance Center). And if you visit the Art Museum at the waterfront in Kowloon \u2014 as you MUST \u2014 you can get a water-level view of Hong Kong Island's skyline during the day."

However, there really needs to be more than 1 viewing platform up there; I could hardly see a thing for about 15-20 mins due to the amount of people up there. The 100dollars don't really give you a good view even from the paid viewing platform; I guess the free one would be even more crowded(although I didnt go there). Not really worth coming there early and shoring up a small area in the viewing platform for seeing the lights on the HK skyline (in my opinion). The lights do look beautiful, and after a while when you manage to get that little sanctuary of space in the viewing platform, it does make it worth. Beware of pushy people, or people trying to take a DSLR quality pic from their VGA camera; just ignore them. Focus on getting that little space to see the skyline, click your pics, and move on!!"

We decided to stay put at about 7 p.m., one hour before the Symphony of Lights which starts at 8 p.m., and worked out because we got to enjoy the transformation of the city from sunset, twilight, to night. As the time drew nearer to 8 p.m. the crowds began to bother and got pretty busy. As for the Symphony of Lights, we were not impressed at all. We expected to see a light show with lasers, dancing lights, etc. however all we saw were a few green light beams out of a building here and there and some minor light patterns. There was music in the background to go with the light show however it was very low and hard to hear. Bottom line: skyline is a must to see but don't expect much from the symphony of lights."

I would highly recommend the ferry from HK to Tsim Sha Tsui, Kowloon. It is only a few pence each way and the lights are best viewed from there in the evening. Really nice promenade at TST, albeit a distinct lack of bars. I found one towards the end of the promenade if you turn right when coming out of the ferry terminal, at which you can sit outside with a good view of the river and lights."

At night the lighted buildings and signs are like Times Square on Steroids. You can cap it off with a ride on the Star Ferry to Hong Kong island for about $0.25 and back.

Sadly we reached there around 8something and missed the symphony of lights show which starts at 8pm daily.It was a spur of the moment decision to visit this place after our dinner nearby and i'm glad for it since our time in HK was just like 2D1N and it's my 1st trip to HK (well, just in passing enroute home).This place really showcase to the visitors the glory of HK's prosperity and modern development esp. at night.However, do beware that there's some major construction beside the Avenue of Stars and our taxi was only able to drop us near the Intercontinental Hotel (just across the street to the waterfront). Best view mayhaps is from the double storey viewing deck besides Tin Sing harbour (\u5929\u661f\u7801\u5934) which is open to tourist and free. Around 15mins walk from the Intercontinental).Sadly it's very hard to take photos without passerby interuptions as the tourists there just don't care to stop and stare at us like we're blocking their path instead of showing some courtesy and hospitality."

It was a bit chilly at night when we caught the light show but was nice and breezy throughout the day since we were near the water. The light show was only about 20-25 minutes and it was a very nice presentation and nice to see the Skyline, but personally I don't think this is a place where you spend more than an hour or two. Unless you want to shop. High end shopping everywhere and overall a good quick trip, however I don't think we would go back."

The scene of the harbour and all the lights shining from the skyscrappers are just fantastic.

The post cards are full of fantastic photos of the view, shot on the one day clear enough a year to see it.The reality is, in Hong Kong itself, you almost never actually see this view. Or any view at all, apart from the horrendously ugly tall buildings that enclose you on all four sides.There is almost no waterfront area where you could sit in say a nice restaurant or cafe and enjoy the view. There is nothing like a walking or running track (like the Thames path) along all the city coast that could have been so nice. Being in Hong Kong makes me appreciate how Europe manages to mix life and living in with work and working. Go down to the waterfront in Kowloon and what do you get? A horrible patch of concrete, a StarBucks and a McDonalds. And a horrible old shopping centre that doesn't even have any windows looking out to \"the view\".Hong Kong is a city of barriers. Every where you try and cross the street, you can't. Concrete barriers, metal barriers, horrendous construction. You can never just go from A to B, even when it's across the street.In the winter months the air pollution is so bad you just want to stay in you tiny room.Don't bother going. Just look at the post cards."

Best place to see is the Avenue of The Stars which is part the way along the promenade. There are two shows - one at around 8pm and I think the other is at 9pm although we didn't see the later one when we were on the star ferry.It's great to see the illuminated cruise liners come into the harbour with the skyscraper back drop, it's worth going just for the view which to me is jaw dropping on every occasion I have been."

On the HK Island side the most popular point to view the skyline is the Victoria harbor and on the kowloon side its the Avenue of Stars also known as TST Promenade. its just a matter of choice from where you want to view it.I personally prefer viewing from Kowloon side from Avenue of Stars since opposite to it the HK skyline is much better on the island side. How to Reach- Victoria harbour is walking distance from Central MTR Station and Hong Kong MTR station. TST Promenade is walking from Tshim sha Tsui (TST) MTR station. You may also choose to take a ferry and in that case the ferry drops you right near clock tower of the TST promenade on kowloon side. OR it drops you to central ferry pier which is walking from victoria harbour should you choose to view from HK sideThe light and sound show starts at 8:10 PM and it is said that it is tallest Light and sound show in the world. All the major skyscrapers on either side participate in this spectacle which goes on for about 50 mins. The total time to spent there would be about 2 hours. The place starts to get crowded as the time for light shown draws nearer, so its better to reach by about 6 to 6:30 PM get a good viewing point and enjoy the view as sun sets down and the lights on the skyscrapers come up gradually. It is one of the most picturesque points of HK and one of the most photographed one in HK.If you choose to view it from TST Promenade then you have a clock tower/ferry pier at one end of promenade and Avenue of Stars on other end. Near the clock tower you have eateries, washrooms and other point of convenience. Even on the Victoria Harbour on HK side there are all the public facilities and eateries available."

The best way to see the skyline is probably aboard the Star Ferry tour, but we chose to take the ferry from Central to Kowloon and then walk along the avenue. It was cloudy and misty but as the sun descended and the lights came on, the glamour of the city was on full view. The classic old Chinese sail boat with red sails is a real beauty and you must take a ride aboard it. We walked along the entire stretch and enjoyed the various fun-time activities that people do by the side of the avenue. While all the names of the stars on the avenue were not familiar to us, we recognized a few international stars like Chow Yun Fat, Jackie Chan and Raymond Chow. The bronze statue of Bruce Lee in his famous \"Enter the Dragon\" fight-pose was a remarkable sight. He must have walked the streets when Hong Kong was a fishing port and the glittering skyline in the background seemed a great and fitting tribute to his contribution in getting the West to embrace it as one of Asia's shining cities."

It seamed to me at first it was a mass protest at some one being anti social with bad flatulence. I meandered my way through the maze and confusion of airport immigration and baggage collection. Later on my first day I hit Soho camera free eating street food and what a jolly nice experience it was too. I woke up the next day not knowing what time zone I was in. I was tired but felt like a child at Christmas with an overwhelming urge to bugger off outdoors and explore was was going on. Mrs W made it clear she was staying in bed so I grabbed the 5D Mark3 and took the 70-300 f/4-5.6 L IS USM out to play. I headed out into Victoria Park which is just off the big shopping district that is Causeway Bay. Victoria Park, named after none other than Victoria Regina is a very busy but peaceful oasis of calm found within a blanket of skyscrapers just off where I was staying on Hong Kong Island. I was taken aback by very old people playing basket ball with teams of youths at 0700am where the temperature was already hitting 30 degrees. As I strolled around I saw mainly elderly people also practicing Tia Chi, meditating as well as having sword fights with invisible people. Very nice I thought to myself, and could not imagine the typical 60 year old Londoner doing the same. I played around with the video function on my camera and managed to get some good footage too.A nightly spectacle in Hong Kong is the Symphony of Lights show and it is a fantastic event that is a must see attraction.A ride up Victoria Peak on a 170 odd year old tram system is I must if you visit Hong Kong. The queuing system for this contraption was an experience to note too. It felt as though half the island decided to do the same about 15 minutes before me. I was wearing my Google Glass, and at first thought everyone was staring at me because I am irresistibly good looking; though the intrigue proved to be 'because' it was the Google Glass. I went to the top of Victoria Peak and to look out over the stunning skyline of Hong Kong. The views were stunning. I headed back into town and went into a camera shop and saw for sale a Canon 300mm 2/1f IS USM L and quickly did the maths with UK prices. It was half price and I was salivating..... The shop I went to quoted HK$30,800 for the lens. I calculated this was \u00a32500 so this needed careful consideration. Too see my pictures click the link to my blog"

Hong Kong's skyline is impressive during the daylight hours but will really startle you when all the skyscrapers are lit in the evening. Be sure to carry your camera along. Adding to the beauty of Hong Kong's skyline is a fantastic multimedia light show that began in January 2004. Dubbed \"A Symphony of Lights\", this orchestrated light and laser show currently features 44 buildings on both sides of Victoria Harbor, View on Hong Kong Island from the Peak though it began on the Kowloon side only. The show features several different kinds of lights including not only simple lighting from inside the buildings but also LEDs, lasers, searchlights, and projection lighting. On special occasions or to mark a particular event, A Symphony of Lights adds fireworks to its nightly presentation.Taking place each night during good weather, the show starts at 8 pm and ends about fifteen minutes later. There are several good places from which to watch A Symphony of Lights, but the best by far is from aboard one of the Victoria Harbor ferries which have special rates and packages available specially for this cruise."

It can be enjoyed day and night, and if viewing conditions are favourable, it has the ability to leave lasting impressions that you will long look back to when thinking about your time in Hong Kong. One of our favourite ways to enjoy the Hong Kong Skyline is by taking harbour cruises or simply hopping on the Star Ferry to cross over between Hong Kong Island and Kowloon. In addition to spending time on the water, it is always impressive to approach the Hong Kong Skyline, watching the skyscrapers quickly begin to tower above you as you near the ferry pier on the HK side. While the Star Ferry crossing is a rather quick ride, you can also consider taking a longer, one hour cruise of Victoria Harbour. Again, we prefer the Star Ferry Harbour Cruise as it is probably the lowest cost option and allows you time on these vessels which are an important part of Hong Kong's heritage and history. Another popular choice is the Aqua Luna junk vessel, which also takes guests around the harbour for a similar experience. One of the best land based positions to enjoy the Hong Kong Skyline is the Tsim Sha Tsui (TST) Promenade, where you have unobstructed views with the harbour directly in front of you. You can also take in excellent views from sky bars and a few restaurants found in the upper levels of buildings in TST. The Sky101 Observation Deck is another popular way to view the Hong Kong Skyline, just be mindful of the viewing conditions before committing to a visit here. From the Hong Kong Island side, you can view the skyline from Victoria Peak. This popular location provides a much different perspective, seeing it in the foreground just in front of Victoria Harbour and the Kowloon Skyline just beyond. Like the position on the TST Promenade, this is a classic spot for making that postcard perfect picture of Hong Kong, one you will long remember after leaving the city."

As usual we had read up on the \"must do's\" one of which was a sail across Victoria Harbour. We went down to the harbour and there seemed to be lots of ways & types of boats & ferries to choose from, we were so glad we chose a traditional junk, not the cheapest way to do it, but well worth the extra.For those that do not know a \"junk\" is an ancient Chinese sailing ship design that is still in use today ours had a magnificent red sailOn board we were directed to several daybeds and served either beer or cocktails and then set sail across the harbour, halfway across we were treated to the Symphony of Lights; which is at 8pm nightly and is a multimedia show and involves more than 40 buildings on both sides of the harbour.We decided to get off the junk across the harbour but believe you can go \"full circle\"You can also stand and watch from either side of the harbour, or on top of one of the tall buildings but for a total experience take a junk!"

Do check their site before you plan to watch the light show on the skyline itself. Take a very good camera to capture the skyline. The amount of light makes phone cameras and point and shoot camera photos look like photos taken at a discotheque. Late nights provide a good respite from the general crowds taking snaps of the skyline."

Yet, because it is so well organised,one does not feel that it is polluted or over crowded . Public transport is excellent so most people do not own cars and hence less pollution. One can buy a common ticket that entitles one to use both the bus service and the train. Taxis are plentiful. They even encourage walking. For example, from the Midlevels where we stayed, to down town One can walk down stairs and return uphill by a chain of 15 escalators. Along the way is a small vending machine in which you can insert your weekly bus ticket and the Machine says \"thank you for walking\" and adds 2 HK dollars to your bus pass ! Bars and small wayside eating joints a plenty. And of course there is plenty to do for all age groups. A visit to Hongkong is highly recommended."

Avoid the summer months since it can get pretty warm. Visit Disneyland and Ocean Park only on week days. Its crowded like hell on weekends and everything from getting into the rides, getting food, getting a taxi back to the hotel etc will be a huge problem. Purchase tickets for these two places in advance if possible and collect them before you enter the park. At least one day each is required to do justice to these places, so plan well. Before you leave the hotel, and assuming you have not taken a package tour, request your hotel to write down the destination name in Chinese. While English is understood by most of the cab drivers, it can be a problem at times. Also, most of the hotels have their details in a small visiting card sized booklet, both in English and Chinese. Carry that at all times to avoid confusion.Be prepared to walk!!! Carry comfortable walking shoes and clothing. People in HK have a fetish for following rules and forming queues! Unlike India, you can't 'jump the queue'. So, don't even try it. Some times people there take offence if you do. We were staying at Ramada at Des Voux Road. There are 2 decent Indian restaurants on Hollywood Street (Bombay Dreams and Jashan) and 1 on Wyndham Street (Ganga's). Book your table in advance, especially on a Friday evening or on weekends. Some people like to have at least one meal which is Indian, and therefore it makes to ensure that you get what you want.Its a safe city and has a vibrant nightlife. Do explore the same. The energy levels that I saw there and the kind of energy that I saw is somewhat lacking here."

A short Star Ferry.ride across Victoria Harbour. This view is seen in any Hong Kong location movie, just to let the movie goers know where they are. On the weekends in the summer there is a light show timed to music,which is broadcast through speakers along the Harbour Walk. The high rise buildings of Hong Kong are lit by thousands of LED lights,and lasers. These lights then flash and make images in time to the music for a fun free show. After the show, go any where to a the many fine restaurants in Tsim Sha Tsui, district of Kowloon. There is even a Hard Rock Cafe,for those who miss American hype.If you are lucky enough to be here during New Years, the light show is coordinated with a spectacular fireworks show. There are three huge barges of fireworks positioned the length of Victoria Harbour. They are computer controlled,so all three barges light off the same firework at the same time. Saying this is spectacular,would be an understatement to say the least. Your vision is filled with exploding color from peripheral to peripheral. Don't forget to breath,is my best advice."

Visit on a cloudy day and the tops of the buildings are lost in the clouds, as the tiny boat taxis dart here and there beneath, and the ferries make their way from Kowloon to HK Island. In the evening the view is amazing, and if you are lucky enough to see the red masted junk sail by at close quarters as we did it just adds to the whole amazing experience. The Avenue of the Stars is also along Kowloon promenade and is a good place to admire the view at the same time. There are lots of runners and walkers who frequent the promenade, locals seemingly, particularly on an evening and it just adds to the diversity of the experience."

At night the buildings on both side of the harbor light up in colorful displays and coupled with the cruise ship lights and constant boat traffic it is pretty exciting. Between eight and nine some of these building lights go into overdrive changing and swirling and just being magical. The problem is the air pollution is so bad in Hong Kong now that on a five day visit this January, three of those days were pretty bad, sickening in fact. One day was so bad I didn't want to leave my hotel room. But Hong Kong is still amazing and the night time skyline is something to behold. Can't say if you should wait until China starts cleaning up its air or you should see it now before it gets worse. It would be five stars without the air pollution."

The technicalities of putting on this show boggle the mind. The show I have heard, costs around HK$44 million per year. Stands are available for visitors to watch the show in comfort on Victoria Harbour waterfront but the ideal place to watch is on a harbour cruise. The best thing it happens every night and it is free - if you watch from the shore."

The Intercontinental and the Ritz-Carlton are both amazing places to experience the sights. Now with all this said, the \u201cSymphony of Lights Show\u201d is the biggest farce that exists. The show is at 8PM all that happens is some green laser lights turn on then off. It is NOT a valid claim at a light show.

You go up several escalators to arrive at the viewing deck. It can be windy up there, bring a warm jacket.The views are wonderful, plenty of opportunity to take photos.

I caught the subway to Tsim Sha Tsui and walked to the avenue of the stars. I arrived around 530 and was told that the light Show didn't begin until 8 pm. Lucky for me it was November and as the night was creeping in the city began to light up! I wasn't able to stay until 8pm but the view was still spectacular! Definitely will be returning for another look and this time staying for the \"show\"!"

Hong Kong is a frenetic place full of stark contrasts: the religious and the pure greed of capitalism, the traditional and the modern, Chinese and English, but most striking is the contrast of very rich and very poor. The night skyline somehow hides the grime and poverty of many cities however (not least the nearby Macau), but I know of few cities that can match the beauty and majesty of the view of Victoria Bay. Do check out Hutong restaurant. A great place to see the 8pm light show (not the most impressive light show on earth, but to have all the major buildings synchronising green lasers is still pretty).Taking a trip across by ferry at night is also a \"must do\".Even sitting on by the ferry terminal looking north towards Kowloon is pretty impressive. There is a pleasant outside bar just by the terminal. Go and get a drink and sit outside on the steps by terminal 3."

No time for ferry ride? No problem, there are many viewing points along the waterfront on both the island and Kowloon side, such as the Wanchai Golden Bauhinia Square, the Avenue of Stars at Tsim Sha Tsui or simply go up to the Victoria Peak where you can experience magnificent 360-degree harbour and skyline views from day to night. Best time to be up there? I'd say at dusk, between 5 to 7 PM, when there is still glowing light of the sunset while you wait for one of the world's most captivating urban night scene come on. It's also the best time to take a good quality photo of the night time panoramic view of the city espeically if you only own amateurish camera equipments."

It alternates days broadcasting the introduction of the buildings in English or Cantonese. On special holidays it becomes more magnificent with the addition of fireworks shooting off from the buildings. I prefer viewing it from the Kowloon side because the Hong Kong skyline has more lit buildings and after the show there are many shops and restaurants to walk to.

As such, it need not be rated since it can't be improved in response to ratings, and marking it down for bad weather is kind of silly. Make sure you don't miss the evening light show and take in the view from Mount Victoria. The Star Ferry cruise for the light show is lovely, too."

The view cannot be described by words - you have to experience it by yourself! Enjoy !"

Ever growing and changing the cityscape can be viewed and recorded from a number of vantage points.From the Kowloon Peninsula, along the Tsim Sha Tsui promenade you can get some of the most iconic views of the Hong Kong Island Skyline and in the evening this is a popular vantage for the \"Symphony of Light\". Another excellent vantage point to see and photograph the Hong Kong Skyline is from the top of Victoria Peak. On a clear day the view is almost unmatched, at night the city it lit up to offer a different and some would say more beautiful view of Asia's world city."

It costs about HKD40 for a return trip on the Peak Tram (excluding access to the viewing deck). Personally I don't think it's worth doubling the price for the viewing deck access. If you look around enough, you'll find some great viewing spots on the peak.Secondly, I saw the skyline from ground level on the Star Ferry. It's well worth taking the ferry from Admiralty to Tsim Sha Tsui so you can take in the sights from the water. A truly immersive experience for less than HKD3 per trip.Finally, I was extremely fortunate to get an almost unique view of the skyline from the roof of the Harbour Grand Hotel in Kowloon. The hotel is situated perfectly and has the most breathtaking rooftop pool that provides views of the entirety of Hong Kong Island. At ovr HKD2,500 per night, it's not a cheap viewpoint to access but the five star hotel experience is taken to that extra level with the rooftop view and pool, a perfect gift perhaps."

You would not thisnk that there was rom to construct anything more on the island.Victoria peak has changed a lot with it now being so commercialised a lot of Chiniese from the mainland. The view is still the same that skyline is magnificent and even more so at night dining on the peak, it is still a wonderful place to take your lady. I think that no matteer what happens the sky line seen by plane, boat or from the landward side will also stir different feelings in people."

On an earlier trip a decade ago my wife and I saw the Hong Kong skyline from Victoria Peak in the evening, which was amazing, and on this trip from the same place during the daytime, which was also spectacular. There is enough construction in the area that the view had changed, but was fabulous both times. Don't miss this when you are in this interesting city. Victoria Peak is a standard stop on most commercial city tours, but you can also take a tram to the top. Plan to spend a little time to explore the view from different angles that can be had by taking the walkway running from the overcommercialized car and tram stop."

Take a stroll by the promenade, sit and introspect, read or just watch people having fun. This place is for all. A cruise would be an added bonus and can be booked at the venue 40 mins before departure. Food is not that great, i paid 180 HKD for a trip and food.

We got a ferry over to Stanley markets which was fantastic. Shopping was great. We also got on the \"train thing\" to the peak. That also was well worth the trip. The only down side here was the difficulty finding a western toilet. I didn't fancy going over a hole in the ground, as clean as it may be, NO THANKS!!!!!!Unfortunately that's where the positives ended for us in this city. The smog and pollution is disgraceful, people bothering you and following you all the time on the streets to buy or have something made, clothing wise. Keep away from the people at the ferry terminal trying to get you to buy tickets and win big prizes. We got sucked in and were taken to the \"Gold Coast\" where it was all about time share. We were extremely angry at them as it wasted nearly a whole day for us. It is very very crowded as well. Wasn't one of our favourite places and we won't be returning."

Better to take Bus 15 and go over the top of Hong Kong for a spectacular ride that takes in both Aberdeen and Hong Kong views along the way. You can take the Peak Tram back with less queueing to deal with. It goes without saying that clear skies can make a huge difference. One suggestion - after you have done the views everyone does, why not walk a half Km along the track to the left of the Peak Tram building and get some spectacular views of the Western part of HK Island. Buses are easy in HK and always terminate at an MTR station so you can never get lost."

No wonder this is the top attraction in Hongkong. While you are in the harbor area, take time to get your profiles drawn by local artists, listen to local musicians performing at various points and needless to say, take great pictures."

The trip with the Star Ferry is always a treat just looking at it .. the placement that you can enjoy the sunset in just the right direction ... spectacular from both sides or up from the peak. The hills in the background (something that i.e. my next favourite skyline, New York, does not have)"

Most people go during the day but it's worth seeing at night time when the laser show comes on and the neon lights on the buildings are switched on. There are multiple vantage points through out the city from the foreshore itself to up in the hills of Hong Kong and they're all worth visiting. If you're staying at one of the hotels on the waterfront, definitely go for a harbour view room."

Most of the time Hong Kong is pretty hazy but if you are lucky enough you might get a clear view on the skyline. Every evening on 8pm there will be a light show including music on mandarin, cantonese or in english. If you are here for chinese new year you should catch the fireworks which is very impressive, not to be mistaken for the normal new years eve firework which is not impressive at all... There are some food stands across the Avenue of Stars but usually just for snacks like dried squid, check out the handprints of the Hong Kong stars while you are there to find famous people like Jacky Chan, Jet Li and Chow Yun Fat."

We saw it from both the Kowloon side and the Island side. At night the skyline is better seen from the Kowloon side. The water front is pretty lively after night fall. People line up to see the Symphony of Lights, which basically is a synchronized laser show projected from various buildings on the Island side. Frankly my wife and I were pretty disappointed by the light show. It's not that interesting. We wish we did not spend several hours to catch it. Going back to the main target of this review, the HK Skyline is a must-go if you plan to see Hong Kong."

Perhaps Hong Kong's most spectacular attraction but it can be viewed a number of ways!!#1(Symphony of Lights)Hustle over to the Tsim Tsa Tsui promenade before 20:00 and set up for the Symphony of Lights - a stunning light and laser show with music accompaniment. Great show but it gets a little crowded most nights. Best viewed from the bar in the Sheraton Towers with a few oysters and a glass or two of chardy.#2 (Star Ferry on Victoria Harbour)A cheaper option than the Symphony of Lights view from the Sheraton Towers but no less spectacular. On a clear day a view of Hong Kong from Victoria Harbour with the Peak in the background looks better than the light show.#3 (Get Down and Amongst It)My personal preference! Wear off some shoe leather and take a wander amongst the architectural marvels that make up Central Hong Kong. There is no substitute for seeing these monsters close up, beside the foundations with some subtle afternoon light reflecting off those many widows!!Try to take in all three views - they are all different and have their own qualities!!"

The evening light show was worth seeing once. The music was a bit lame and it wasn't breathtaking but free and worth the effort, especially if you simply time it when you need to do the crossing on the ferry anyway.Even during the day you can just stand and admire all the skyscrapers."

I'm from Singapore so skyscrapers are nothing new to me, but the view from the top of the peak is something jaw-dropping, not a view that can be easily seen in Singapore where everywhere is quite flat.Suggest to come on the peak tram around evening time (allow time for queuing) when you can see both day and night views. Then you can have dinner at the peak. There are malls up there."

Take a walk along the avenue of stars in the early morning and breathe the exhilarating sea breeze. The view captures imagination. The mountains, the harbor, the skyline and the sea. Nothing wakes you up better than a good walk along a beautiful landscape. At night the place is full of people and you can't really enjoy it. But you should see the lights from the opposite building and their reflection in the water."

I then lived in Hong Kong as an Ex-Pat for 18 months in 2007-2008 and the Skyline still blew me away even when I saw it almost everyday.I still visit Hong Kong from time to time now and the night Skyline viewed from the Kowloon, Tsim Sha Tsui (TST), side still amazes me and I always try to get to TST to see it during my trip.Is staying on the Island take the Star Ferry from Central or Wan Chai to TST as the view from the ferry is stunning as well and the ferry is very cheap (just a few HK$). Alternatively use the MTR and get out at TST station and walk from there to the Clock Tower / Star Ferry Terminal as this is the best place from which to see the Skyline of Hong Kong Island...

We view the skyline from the Avenue of the Stars. The view is overwhelming with full lit lights of the Hong Kong business district. We waited and watched for the 8 p.m. Symphony of Lights show. However, the show was disappointing as we not to sure what was happening and what to focus on with the lights all over the place, and blurry. We gave up watching the show halfway and we on to take the Star Ferry and went over opposite where the skyline is.Suggestion: Do go there during evening as weather will be much cooler as you wait for the skyline to light up. But do bring umbrella when it rains as there are not much sheltered areas there."

They need to have a head count to how many should be on the tram at one time. Once you reach the top it is a great view but by the time you get back down which is an hour wait again to get back down you would be better off finding a high rise building to view the city it would be so much more enjoyable."

This is the most memorable skyline from a ferry ride, it was also my last ride before departing Hong Kong. The rainbow reflection from the water makes the nighttime even more glamorous. Each way is only $2 USD. Hong Kong is such an happening place enriched with traditional cultures and histories of its people. What we are witnessing today, is the aftermath of the hundred years of battles, millions of handwork, and sacrifices. I personally think that the best views of the Hong Kong Island side come from the world famous Victoria Peak with its glamorous views of Hong Kong Island skyscrapers. My friend and I both trying to catch the sunset and took the MTR to the tram. But the tram takes at least 3 hours in line! She instantly changed of game plan and took us onto the double decker bus to catch another express bus from the star ferry pier to the Peak. I am really glad that we choose to ride the double decker bus, as you get to see the downtown sitting from the top view. When we got to the top of the peak, it was just perfect timing at sunset. We waited 30min for the city to get dark and needless to say, it was the highlight of my trip."

I found out in the evening that there's this lightshow called 'Symphony of Lights', a massive coordinated light show every day at 8pm if the weather permits. Watching it from Harbour City, the show started off subtly, without the sign from one of the buildings, I would not have known that it started.

I've been back twice, 2007 and 2012 both times in November and very hot like Vancouver, cdn's summer. I think i'd die in dead summer. Subway system is by distance, so they calculate based on the number of stops. if you're using it lots maybe it's good to get and load up a travel card called the Octopus card than trying to find change all the time. Then there are independent white buses on separate system more on local smaller street routes (i think individual owns their own like a taxi but instead a mini bus and then large double decker buses that run on main routes that also uses the Octopus card. Pros: cheaper food, LOT of variety, lots of night life, lots of stores and malls, lots of restaurants, as small as Hong Kong is there is a Disneyland, street food everywhere. interesting and unique trinkets that you won't see in North America. Sub way system is great and connect many places together, they have a night laser show at the harbour (think it might be daily or weekend only, sorry can't remember), neat country side type locations accessible but small boats/ferries, Cons: lack of variety in types of food, the streets actually has a constant smell of sewer, small restaurants and food carts seems dirty, public bathrooms are quite stinky, REMEMBER TO BRING TISSUE WITH YOU AT ALL TIMES. Lots of bathrooms don't provide unless you're in bigger restaurants, mostly cash if you want other than nice restaurants. Very congested and busy all the time. I got in trouble for trying to take photos of food street carts during night. they thought I was a reporter. They are running an illegal business so i understand....so DO NOT TAKE PHOTOS."

Whatever happened the island is still thriving ahead with much of the energy as in the previous past.

The highest and most spectacular one now is from the top of ICC (International Commerce Center) in Kowloon -- at the observation deck (fee to get in) and from the Ritz-Carlton HK's restaurants (my favorite is from The Lounge window tables -- no fee as long as you're eating or drinking here). The sister tower of ICC is the IFC (International Finance Center) located in Central, HK. It too has expansive views of Kowloon and parts of Central.

Or, even better than movies. Avenue of stars was a good place to see symphony of lights, but it seems to be quite crowded at a time. Skyline was definitely one of absolute high lights on my vacation and one of the reasons making me want to return to HK."

Quite a few of the buildings are iconic and luckily there are many spots to see it from.To see Hong Kong's iconic skyline: go to the Avenue of the Stars on the Kowloon side. Alternatively you can pay for the Sky100 observation deck and have a slightly more encompassing view from above.To see the other side of Hong Kong's skyline: go to the Victoria Peak and you will see the famous picture that comes first in any search of Hong Kong (in no small part due to Wikipedia).To see Kowloon's skyline: go to one of the free observation decks on the Hong Kong side, like the Bank of China Tower (open one day a week), or the Exhibition Center."

They print it on the spot for you and it becomes the perfect souvenir from Hong Kong."

Unless you are nearby, then it's not a big loss for missing it.I heard a group was comparing Singapore Mbps laser lights vs this hk skyline, they said the effect is better than hk's. I haven't seen mbs but I seen sentosa's and disney's. Honestly, I was truly disappointed when I saw this skyline on last sat.But near the ferry terminal side toward the stars avenue , some young groups or individuals will set up a small area to sing their songs or some singers' songs.

I used to always fly at night on night trips to see the skyline all lit up. For years I thought the best thing in the world was the New York skyline. But in truth it doesn't hold a candle to the Hong Kong skyline. So whatever vantage point you can get to whether it be the peak for one of the many observation decks or rooftop restaurants I advise to go up and have a look. And no time could be better then around Christmas time where this Chinese City outdoes any western city I have ever been to in terms of decorating their buildings with Christmas lights it's amazing. Also I don't know if they are still doing it but for a while in the evenings at 8 o'clock pm they used to do laser shows around the buildings it was really nice"

Having watched similar sites else where in the world, i can vouch for this site.Try to carry your tripods, if you wish to capture the transformation of the scene during late evening to night. The avenue of stars is not very impressive, given that most stars are local ones. We cannot identify any star other than Jackie Chan and Bruce Lee. The view from Victoria Peak is spectacular, as well. Try and get the glimpse during day and night from the Peak, if time permits. Spectacular is the word to describe the experience."

It is without doubt the most impressive skyline in the world. The hundreds of tightly packed glittering skyscrapers set in front of the mountains and reflecting in Victoria Harbor is a sight that you will never forget. Take a stroll along the 'Avenue of Stars', watch the Symphony of Lights (a musically synchronized light and laser using the skyscrapers) in the evening, relax at one of the fancy restaurants and cafes that line the harbor front area and take it all in. For alternative (and equally breathtaking) views of the skyline take the historic 'Star Ferry' across the harbor to see the skyline up close or look down onto the city with a birds eye view (something you can only do in Hong Kong) from 'Victoria Peak'."

A ride up to Victoria Peak during the day will give you fantastic views. If you go up Sky100, again you will get some great sights, but for night time viewing head to the promenade in Tsim Sha Tsui right behind the Intercontinental Hotel at about 7:00 and you will see the spectacular skyline along with a light show. The light show is not that great, but the skyline with the lights and crowds of people is a definite for a visit to Hong Kong. Tsim Sha Sui is a stop on the MTR red line."

Hong Kong is known for many things but one of the main attractions in the city is the Victoria Harbour with its amazing skyline of skyscrapers with junk boats sailing past in the foreground.I have only been to Hong Kong once, and I made sure that Victoria Harbour was my first port of call. I consider the Hong Kong skyline along the harbour to be the finest in the world, even ahead of the numerous skyscrapers of New York, Dubai, Tokyo, the Marina Bay area of Singapore, or even Sydney Harbour! There is just something so special about Hong Kong\u2019s waterfront.There is a boardwalk alongside the harbour called The Avenue of Stars, which showcases the famous names in the Hong Kong and Cantonese entertainment industries, which began with the Shaw Brothers\u2019 movie studio and has since spawned numerous Kung-Fu and martial arts heroes such as Bruce Lee.It is often blisteringly hot and humid in Hong Kong, and along the Avenue of Stars there is not much respite from the glaring sun, so make sure you bring along an umbrella or top up with sun lotion! It is nevertheless a popular area for tourists and locals alike to enjoy a pleasant walk in the daytime while enjoying the view and taking photos! It is in the evening, however, when the Harbour comes to life. A breath-taking laser and light show called The Symphony of Lights is held every night where the skyscrapers on the Central side of Hong Kong are illuminated to a musical soundtrack. It provides an amazing photo and video opportunity!There are plenty of things to do and go and see in Hong Kong, including the famous Victoria Peak, but you cannot go wrong by spending an hour or two at Victoria Harbour in the daytime, and then return in the evening for the entertainment. It is really one of the \u2018happening areas\u2019 of the city. The show is, of course, free, but make sure to get there quite early in the evening, as you don\u2019t want too many people standing in front of you obscuring your views!"

Don't know the TST/Wanchai crossing - maybe 15 minutes... Cheap as chips, anyone can afford it. I used my Octopus Card so don't recall the cost.... 20 pence or something ridiculous like that. Bargain!Otherwise, stroll along the TST promenade, from TST East up to Ocean Terminal. The better view is from Kowloon looking across to HK Island.

Hong Kong lacks anything in the way of grand historic landmark buildings. But, if you're a neophyte with a Le Corbusier fetish, you'll love it. By day it's a mixture of sterile glass and chrome offices and shabby high rise tenements, often shrouded in the thick grey haze of pollution drifting over from mainland China. But, it really comes alive at night when the lights come on. Then it transforms from a caterpillar to a shimmering butterfly. If you can find a suitably elevated viewpoint (try the 28th floor roof terrace bar at the Park Lane Hotel on Gloucester Road) you'll get a spectacular view of the illuminated buildings including the Bank of China tower, and the Kowloon waterfront reflected in the waters of the harbour. If you're lucky you'll see one the many cruise ships float by, lit up like a Christmas tree. It put me in mind of Ridley Scott's Blade Runner. If you walk the streets at night you can often hear public service announcements in Cantonese, and I'm sure they were advertising opportunities in the off world colonies. We even saw a drone one evening flying above the crowds. Unique. You'll either love it or hate it."

The most preferred spot is across the harbor, on the viewing platform close to the Avenue of the stars, just outside the 'Harbour City' shopping mall. From the HK side (Victoria Harbour) easy to reach by ferry (going to Tsim Sha Tsui). It's often a crowded place, especially when the 'Symphony of Lights' is shown (daily at 20:00). The show is spectacular, but the view around sunset, when the lights mix-in with the red sky, are even more breathtaking. The bar of the Felix Restaurant (in the Peninsula Hotel) is also often cited as an excellent viewing point. Unfortunately the bar is very small and often the shades are down so that you just get a limited view of the skyline (the famous view of the Felix bathroom is more interesting, but a real replacement).The very best view is from the 'Wooloomooloo' rooftop bar (in the 'Hennessey' building, 256 Hennessy Rd, Wanchai. Yes, it's the 'wrong' side, but the skyscrapers are almost in arms reach. It's almost 360 degree view, less crowded and you can enjoy a drink without getting ripped-off. If this makes you hungry, go downstairs to the Wooloomooloo restaurant for an outstanding steak or western/fusion dinner. You will not regret any dollar spent there! Note: the bar occasionally has private functions, calling in advance is recommendable."

Hong Kong Skyline ranked as the no. 1 Skyline in the world in CNN's 2010 publication containing the names of top 20 Skylines worldwide. It fully justifies it's top rating with spectacular views offered from either side of the Victoria harbour. The tall skyscraper buildings, mostly in Hong Kong island are best viewed from The Tsim Tsa Tsui promenade of Kowloon. The daily night 8 pm light & sound laser show in which the light falls on the skyscraper buildings located on the Hong Kong island, draws huge crowd of tourists. The best views from Hong Kong side are from Victoria Peak, IFC Mall & China Bank building. However, foggy weather sometimes play spoil sport for the panoramic views of the skyline."

Not that many lasers, not much variation in what they do. If you've ever been to a concert with some laser lights, you've already seen better. If it's matter of choosing between the light show and something else, choose the something else,"

I admit this is touristy, but as a native Hong Konger, this is my personal top 3 recommendation if you are coming to visit Hong Kong and tight on time. When I am in Tsim Sha Tsui I would especially take the star ferry at night to appreciate this view.This is admittedly the best night view I have seen, compared to Hakodate (\u51fd\u9928), New York, Chicago, Shanghai, Singapore, Paris...reason being for its large cluster, colourful neon lights and variety of skyscrapers - all with a hefty price to HK's environment - something I always bear in mind and leaving me food for thought about HK's future and town planning in current social environment..Don't miss the 8pm fireworks too. Best place to view would be in Tsim Sha Tsui waterfront, either Ave of the Stars or the small pier on the left of Harbour City's main entrance where restaurants were lined up. Alternatively a good place for a private, reasonable dinner setting (~HK$250 px) would be on One Peking Road, in the Japanese restaurant \u706b\u9593\u571f where there are private tatami rooms and good food. View is superb and better than the over-priced restaurants in Harbour City. But be sure to book in advance.Happy to recommend more places if you are tight on time or have too much time in Hong Kong."

Hong Kong skyline is easily one amongst the top five in the world\u2026 The skyline particularly on the south side of the Victoria Harbour transforms in to a mesmerising canvas of lights and colours as the sun sets. The best way to witness it is from the opposite side of the harbour from the Avenue of Stars in Tsim Sha Tsui. The icing on the cake is the 15 min light and sound show named \u201cSymphony of Lights\u201d which takes place every evening at 8:00PM. This is a show of dancing LED and lasers lights from over 45 buildings across both side of the harbour reacting rhythmically to a soothing music. The best way to capture the skyline in your camera is from the promenade from Tsim Sha Tsui side of the harbour. You will need a camera with shutter speed control and a tripod in order to capture the colourful lights in their full glory. \u201cThe Peak\u201d located on the north side of the harbour also offers a bird\u2019s eye view of the skyline. Another way to enjoy the skyline is to take ferry ride across the harbour\u2026"

Words can't do justice on how spectacular the skyline really is. Alternatively, ride the Jetfoil over to Macau for additional views of the skyline. If you're on the HK side, there is a path that runs along the edge of the water affording views of Kowloon's skyline.

I thought at first that my rating was a little harsh, maybe a \"good\" at best, but then the skyline is that of most modern cities, except some are lit up.We were going to take a boat trip around the harbour during the 8pm light/laser show for the best position, but it started raing slighly and the wind was getting up, the water started getting choppy. So plan B was implemented to view from the Avenue of Stars, Kowloon side. Plenty of people had the same idea, but we managed to get a good view of all the area. The lights and laser show, very disappointing and not really worth the effort to put it on. I know I was not expecting some sort of Disney's Epcot type show, but this was quite underwelming to say the least. You may aswell just look at the skyline when it is lit normally, take some photos and leave before all the crowds for the 8pm show."

Stick around for the narrated show which started at 8pm in January, I imagine that it will be later during the summer months. On weekends look for the Junk Boat sailing the harbor."

From the moment you leave the airport to drive into the city (assuming you do), you'll likely have your nose pressed up against the glass wondering at the movie-esque architectural scenery towering above you. The skyline is definitely best seen from down on the Kowloon side of the harbour, just be ready for the crowds. If you want to sit through the light show (every night, 8pm) then make sure to get there early. If you want to get the ferry tour that takes in the light show (19.55 from Tsim Sha Tsui) you'll have to go and get tickets earlier in the day - it sells out hours early. To be honest, though, while the skyline is definitely something you should pop down to the water to catch during any stay in HKG, the light show is a bit of a let down. Really nothing spectacular and a lot of people leave early. As for the 'commentary... tonight in English!', I didn't hear more than a few words spoken. Maybe that came after the 20 minutes or so it took me to get bored an give up.Light show let-down aside, the skyline itself is fab."

As others have said the best view is from Kowloon looking back at HK island, although it does look good the other way too. One of the things I like it the boats that cruise up and down the harbour, especially during the light show with their own lights highlighting the shape of the boats, much more atmospheric than during the daytime."

So for 10 minutes of lightshow you have to sit in the terrible boat and waste your time for hour and a half. Worthless. Do not try, trust me. Light show, is another joke. What you see at night from any place in honk kong that is the lighshow, apart from that they turn on three lasers on the buildings and put on bearly hearable music on the ship. The woman over speaker has suck strong accent and so silent that you do not understand what she is saying. Nothing. Wortless. The skyline itself is worth seeing at day and at night.

Night time is especially enchanting because the buildings are lit up and you might even get a glimpse of the old junk with the red sail, that cruises by throughout the evening. Going to the top of the Peak is another must for skyline views, but for those who want some exercise, try walking the loop trail which starts at the top of the tram.Don't bother if it's foggy but on a clear day, it's a little diamond in the ruff.

The \"star wars\" laser light show at night (when it is on) is an added bonus.Best night vantage point is near the clock tower on the harbour bank.Day time the view is usually spoiled by the fog & mist in the air all the way right to the horizon - at least it was so in December, during our visit.The Star Ferry is also a great way to view the harbour lights at night - it gives an additional perspective."

The smoke and the smog is so thick that the sky line is covered with haze. The night is better, because of all the X'mas lighting, but you still cannot see far.The day after all those rain, I finally get a better view of the harbor. But it was again covered over at night.

For me, I think it's best to be there by the evening before the sun sets. The sunset view is as good as the night view (on days of good weather). The first time I was there, it started raining heavily just when the laser show was about to start. Had to run for cover whilst lugging my tripod and backpack as I didn't expect the rain.While for the laser show, it wasn't as spectacular as I have expected but would still recommend first timers to Hong Kong to go watch. It's just my personal opinion so I am sure there are others' who would love it. Also, it would be wise to be there earlier if you want to have a good spot to watch the laser show. There is a Starbucks Cafe along the Avenue of Stars so you can grab some light food and maybe have a hearty dinner after the laser show as the show lasts about 15 minutes."

It was OK but it did not match the hype we heard before we went.The Avenue of the Stars is statues and hand prints of famous people from Hong Kong. It is fun watching the tourist who know the stars get their pictures taken with the statues.We also took the Star Ferry across the Victoria Harbour to Hong Kong Island. This ride was very cheap and well worth the time.I had trouble breathing in Hong Kong, I constantly had a runny nose and a cough. It was much worse near Victoria Harbour.

Cheap and economical, and well worth the price and time for the views that it provides."

Hong Kong Island's skyline is absolutely stunning and beautiful ... whether it is during the daytime or at night, when the lights bring it to life. The best place to see the HK Island skyline is from the Kowloon side along the harbour promenade which starts from the Star Ferry Terminal in Tsim Sha Tsui. It is reported that Hong Kong has more buildings over 500 feet (or 150 metres) than any other city in the world. One of the best ways to see both skylines (ie. the Island & Kowloon) and which is inexpensive, is simply to take a ride on the Star Ferry from Central to TST and then TST across to Wan Chai. The Peak also provides great views of both skylines but from a different perspective as you are looking down onto the harbour from a high advantage point."

I actually stay in the victoria harbor vicinity quite often on my business trips and the Sheraton there always put me in a nice skyline view room. The harbor is great for a good run in the morning but it is even more impressive at night when all the building are lid up. For money savers like me, you can take the ferry across the harbor for a very cheap price, but just make sure to do it at night only. An amazing attraction in hong kong and this is the first place i take visitors to when they come visit with me."

We lived in a highrise right on the water above the Pacific Club for about 6 months, but I can tell you it never gets old. It still takes our breath away when we come into town or bring visitors. The light show every night at 8pm is a must-see. Stake out a spot on the observation deck close to the clock tower (right by the Star Ferry terminal) to hear the music that is synchronized with the light / laser show. It is always a bit crowded (even in the rain!), so for a front row spot, get there at least 15 minutes ahead of time."

Try and catch it while you are visiting the harbour, don't go to the seating area and watch it - seating is just concrete steps. at the start of the show, people push in front of you, so keep your place. after the show finding public transport close by was a mission- no train stations close by. we ended up cabbing it back to the hotel.

Don't bother to wait in line to take the tram, catch a cab and your at the top for the price of the tram. Spend your time walking the paved path rather than waiting in line for hours. Once on the Peak walk around, don't forget to look up at the vegetation, you might catch sight of one of the giant leggy spiders. Check out the vegetation: giant India Rubber Trees and more! The free walk gives the best view of Hong Kong. I don't recommend going up on the roof top of the man made building to see the city; you have to pay once you get to the fourth esculator and you get the same view as the free walk. At night, go to the Kowloon side of Hong Kong and go to the walk of Stars: find Bruce Lee and Charlie Chan and then at 8 and 9 pm, watch the symphony of lights for which the Chinese spend so much on creating a great light show. I don't think it's as great as the harbour lights - the Bund in Shainghai but it is beautiful... don't miss it. After the light show, walk to the harbour and take the ferry back to HK island. It's all just for the cost of your metro or ferry ride. It's a great deal and one of the sites for which HK is most famous."

Having lived there for 13 years, I only managed to see it a few times as I lived far away from the city. Many people say it is ideal to catch it at night when all the lights are on and the laser show starts. The best time is during Chinese New Year or Christmas when the buildings have additional lights in celebration for festivities. Take a Star Ferry during the day (when its not smoggy) and take photos. Hong Kong is wonderful place to stay, the skyline is by far one of the worlds best attractions."

Walking along the TST Promenade recently, like we've done hundreds of times before, we had to just stop and admire the Hong Kong Skyline. It is magnificent, set behind the lovely Victoria Harbour and and in front the sloping peaks of Hong Kong Island. When sky conditions are favourable, this is truly one of the finest skylines in the world. The Hong Kong Skyline represents the impressive collection of giant skyscrapers on Hong Kong Island, which are best seen across the harbour in Kowloon. There are spectacular views from quite a few restaurants and bars in the area but there is no place we enjoy admiring the skyline more than ground level directly on the Tsim Sha Tsui Promenade and there are three times of the day to enjoy being on the TST Promenade to catch views of the Hong Kong Skyline. First thing in the morning, before the crowds arrive, you can have the entire waterfront to yourself. This is a peaceful time and the best chance you will have for uninterrupted photographs of the Hong Kong Skyline as well as the famous Bruce Lee Statue and other interesting things to see on the Avenue of Stars section of the TST Promenade. As the sun begins to rise, the sky bleaches out and the nicer views are lost until mid-afternoon. Unfortunately, about this time, the crowds begin to descend upon the promenade area and they pretty much stay for the remainder of the day. Depending on the time of year and the weather conditions, at some point in the mid-afternoon, the sun will begin to recline towards the west which can have the affect of making fine shooting conditions of the skyline from the Avenue of Stars area. At this time of the day, the sun is at your back, adding nice light to the island peaks, Skyline and harbour. If the sky conditions are favorable, you can also benefit from deep blue skies as well. This is when you can get those optimal daytime photographs of the skyline. Unfortunately, crowds remain heavy during this time period and if the air quality or weather is poor, the skyline views can be disappointing at this time of day so we usually take a pass and wait until after dark to visit instead. Finally, night visits to the promenade are always recommendable. Regardless of the air quality, being on the promenade after dark provides you the opportunity to see all of the entire Hong Kong Skyline fully lit, illuminating Victoria Harbour. While the crowds are quite heavy, particularly around 8pm when the Symphony of lights show begins, you can usually find a nice spot to set-up a tripod and take pictures of the Skyline. And, when we have good air quality, night views of the skyline can be breathtaking, making a memorable experience for visitors to Hong Kong. As such, we almost always tell our guests to watch the air quality in the morning and if it looks very good, to rearrange some of their activities so that they can visit the TST Promenade and Avenue of Stars during the afternoon and night to catch the Hong Kong Skyline at its very best. In the end, only Manhattan Island in New York City compares in beauty, scale and magnificence to the Hong Kong Skyline, a place that is a real source of pride for our city."

Rather arrive at the ferry terminal in good time, secure yourself a good spot (it's a big area) and watch it from on shore. The ultimate would be to watch it from Victoria Peak"

During the daytime, I managed to get some iconic images of the Star Ferry in the foreground, and the Red Sailed Junk with the Skyline behind. Another interesting view is from the Ferry returning to Hong Kong from a trip to Macau. Another good view is from the Peak, both day and night time."

From on high, the Ozone Bar in the Ritz Carlton and any of the bars/restaurants in The One building (100 Nathan Road) give a perspective of the island itself. From low the Star Ferry must rank as the best value for money (HKD2.5/3.4 at weekends) in the world. Also a walk along the Avenue of Stars in Tsim Sha Tsui is a very pleasant stroll on a nice day.

You will wait around an hour, and once you take the tram up, you will have a short moment where the tram stops for a minute for people to take pictures. When arriving on the top, you can take pictures, do some shopping, have a coffee while watching the skyline, yadayada..... and it is also worth it to walk for around 15 minutes along the Peak Trail, starting from Lugard Road. After walking for quarter of an hour along a curving, dark, but easy track, you will be able to see the Skyline from a different point of view. It is actually a great idea to include trekking in your Hong Kong traveling other than shopping, eating and seeing historical stuffs. The Peak Tram goes until 12 p.m. so it is not a bad idea to go around 9 or 10 pm if you are not tired.... When coming back down, it's not bad to take bus number 1. You will wait around 2~10 minutes depending on the length of the line and soon enough you will enjoy a curvy drive down the mountain through expensive apartments. Overall, this is a great place to go other than having to line up a bit,"

First evening, we went to a bar on the top floor of Beijing Road no 1, where there's only glass and illuminated table but nothing else. The night view of the HK island side was so pretty and you get a panorama view there.The second day we went to a restaurant on a hundredth floor at ICC on west Kowloon, pity the day was a bit misty so couldn't see much. If you're fancy to see the Kowloon view instead, I'd also recommend you try walking into one of the high floor restaurants on the HK Island side (e.g. the Chinese restaurant at Mandarin oriental or IFC).

Please see some of the photos that I have attached herewith to get a sense of what I am trying to convey.The peak is the next best option; however, it doesn't bring you real close to the action and the quality of view is heavily dependent on the pollution and the weather.I have also seen the light show from the Avenue of Stars at the TST promenade but found the experience too noisy and marred by everybody trying to take photos or record videos."

I recommend riding the Star Ferry to see the skyline from sea level. Walk around the waterfront in Kowloon to see HK Island's skyline and take a few pictures. I also recommend seeing the skyline from Victoria Peak. I took the Peak tram and did the walk recommened by Loney Planet (take Harlech rd and then Lugard rd). You get some pretty awesome views of Lamma island and Victoria Harbor. Go on a clear day if posssible. Try to see the skyline during the day and night!"

Go to Victoria Peak (best by the peak tram, but you can go by car) and see Hong Kong skyline from above. Pretty amazing. 3.

The Peak is amazing, after taking the tram to the top, you enter a large shopping center, this is where you can access the viewing area at the top, there is a charge but again very reasonable for the amazing views that you are going to take in of Hong Kong and the surrounding areas. You are so high up its hard to fathom and the mountain behind you is still taller. The Skyline doesnt open until 10.30am so we hung around a while and took a walk which turned into a hike....anyhow the peak is well worth a visit, we visited in June and although humid at the base there was a nice breeze when you got to the top"

This comment is true either from Kowloon to HK Island, or vice versa. Because there is so little to say that others haven't, I can just point out two things: (1) HK has several of the world's 50 tallest buildings. They add great value to the view. (2) When you look over at higher-end residential areas at night, you may see large buildings with few lights. Many flats have been bought by real estate speculators who do not wish to rent them out to facilitate an easy sale. So they are empty, and therefore dark. Go up to Victoria Peak to see the lights at night but be prepared for massive crowds. And as for the 8 PM laser light show, well, ummm, as often as not, people say \"is that all there is?\""

I visited Avenue of the Stars to view the skyline during the light show period (scheduled every night on 8.00-8.10 pm), which is honestly not that spectacular and might explain the inflated crowd size, so perhaps best to avoid that timing. Heard that sometimes the weather can be a bit foggy to see the buildings clearly too, so make sure you research the best timing before visiting.The skyline itself is quite magnificent. It boasts only one truly iconic architecture (Bank of China), but where it lacks in gravity-defying buildings, it makes up in vastness and volume. With 2,354 skyscrapers above 100 m (making Hong Kong #1 in the planet), you can see grand buildings towering to the sky from left to right."

It was quite impromptu from Guam and did not have any hotel booked. As I found out the Canton Trade Fair was happening same week and no available reasonably priced hotels. Only the high price $350 US/night were available. Moral of story, if you plan to visit Hong Kong, plan way way ahead especially when it comes to lodging. For the 5 days in Hong Kong while waiting for monday to apply for visa, spent several times in the Tsim Sha Tsui promenade area walking and taking photos. I must have traversed the Star Ferry between Tsim Sha Tsui and HK Island at least 6 or 7 times. Cheap fares allows for running back and forth without too much hassle. The skyline of Hong Kong is breath taking during the day as well as at night. I saw the only Red Sail Chinese Junk tour boat, but was not able to catch a tour. Took another evening night cruise and the night harbor views were great. The service on the cruise was not that good. The crew spoke very little english and did not announce what the views were, so we were left to ourselves asking other tourist what is this or that. The tour boats need to train their staff better to accomodate tourists who do not know the area. This would have made a much better value than just a cruise with a couple of soda/piece of cookie thrown in.I just returned from my second trip to HK. This time I took more time to stroll the promenade and looked for the movie star hand print plaques and took photos. Enjoyed the music from the christian group along the way. And again, the spectacular views of the HK skyline was there. This time the weather was quite cloudy and rain intermittenly with fog shrouds. I was able to do the harbor cruise on the chinese junk, the AquaLuna this trip. Although a nice cruise, I was disappointed that only 7 tourists were on this more expensive evening cruise. It did not feel like a party and was disappointing in this sense. The crew was accomodating and the experience was OK, first time to cruise on a genuine HK Red Sail junk. Again, no english announcements of what the landmarks are along the cruise. This trip I tried the subway and was impressed by the efficiency and cleanliness of the system, once one finds out which way to go and the landmark stops before the next stops, etc. Needless to say, I got lost a few times. I speak a few words of Cantonese, but I could not understand the fast pace speech of the locals when asking for directions. Another landmark to visit is surely Victoria Peak and taking the cable trams. Great view of the city harbor and skylines.As an architect, I must say that the modern architecture of HK and mainland China is so impressive to say the least and is so far ahead of the US architecture now. Actually, I am more interested in the traditional architecture of China and how they are able to preserve and rehab these ancient architecture to its present state. I hope they will continue to improve in this area of preservation rather than tear down and build more nameless soulless shopping malls and high rises. The ancient architectural treasure of China is what set this historically and culturally rich country apart from the USA or most countries for that matter. While adapting and borrowing the high technologies from the west to modernize, I truly hope the Chinese and HK'nese do not forget their rich proud and formidable past cultural history. I am hoping to traveling back to HK and China again soon and will visit the Tsim Sha Tsui harbor area again and again marvel at the modern skyline advancement of HK and China.Allen from Hawaii"

The music coordinated the laser lights on the tops of many HK buildings, flashing toward Kowloon for 5-10 seconds at a time. To get photos required a really fast camera.Since the light show started at 8PM , many people walk the length of the fantastic walk along the harbor on the Kowloon side. In addition to various shows/exhibitions/minstrels performing, there was a tribute to numerous Chinese movie stars and places to get on a harbor taxi or dinner ship. This walk was not finished on our last visit but has become a must-see in HK. Hope the light show stays on."

If you're outside the range of the loudspeakers, tune your mobile phone's FM radio to 103.4FM along the harbour front to listen to the music during the show. If you want a different view of the skyline, then try the view from Sam Ka Tsuen. Either take a ferry from near Sai Wan Ho MTR station, or MTR to Yau Tong and walk towards the water.

See it from the top of Mount Victoria on a clear day, but I echo other reviews that say see it from the Star Ferry. The trip across the harbor gives you a good view of the skyline day or night and the trip costs HK$2.00. OR, take the Star Ferry cruise at 7:55 pm to see the light show. You're out for an hour cruising around. The boat they use isn't one they use for ferry service but for their harbor cruises. The day I went was rainy, misty, foggy, very low ceiling, etc. Until it was time for the harbour lights cruise and it turned crystal clear. There were still storms around so in the background was spectacular lightning to go with the lights of the skyline. I hope you get that lucky. (One thing, the harbour cruise costs a lot more than 2.00. I think the harbour lights cruise is HK$170, or about US$20.)"

Best enjoyed during day time, though evening views are nice as well.- From the TST promenade on the Kowloon side overlooking the Victoria Harbour and the Impressive HK island skyline... especially in the evening/ night as the buildings light up and there are wonderful multicolored reflections in the water. The sound and light show is much talked about but totally over-rated in my opinion. Don't rush to make it if you can't.- From the terrace of the IFC shopping mall... Overlooking the harbour and the Kowloon skyline. It's a public area and you can get your own food/ drinks and enjoy a leisurely evening."

It's a fast paced city and everything seemed to move so fast , Just look after your valuables at all times . The food is good but it depends on individual taste too . The wet market is worth visiting around Mong Kok area . H.K. people likes everything fresh and live especially sea food . So it's interesting to see live creatures at the market ."

Its great now that the ICC is there, as that has a stunning light show! I mean, the laser and things are cool on the other buildings. and the bank of china building still looks modern with its geometric shapes. but seeing the ICC with its full length LED show is great! Very tasteful, scrolling chinese new year and valentines messages this time round! Its Best from Tsim Sha Tsui by the avenue of the stars. you dont see the ICC so well from there, but you see the gorgeous central area across the water. Best at night! And take a star ferry for a cheap boat trip across the water! the picture opportunities are great from the left hand side of the boat!"

The rooms are small but just enough, because you only sleep there. There is so much to do in Hong Kong and you must try to go for at least a week, if not more. Lot's of shopping if you like to shop, but we did not do much shopping. There are many restaurants and smaller places to eat and they cater for most budgets. The one thing we found most spectacular are the buildings, they are awe-inspiring, unbelievable, incredible!!Take a trip around the harbor at night and just see how spectacular they are!! They are lit up and make an incredible sight!Getting around the Island is easy, you can take a tram, which goes halfway round the island and then take bus which goes around the other half. Both of these cost very little money and you get to see Repulse Bay, which has very expensive houses overlooking the sea and a lovely beach and you get to Stanley market, where you can buy all-sorts. Also Ocean Park, where you can really enjoy yourself.The Peak Tram is not to be missed, try and go up late afternoon, so that you can be up there in the evening to see the spectacular lights! Awesome!A ferry ride across to Tsim Sha Tsui is a must do, also very little money to ride across the harbor. You can also take the underground or MTR, in fact do one way and then go back the other way. We enjoyed staying on the Island instead of the mainland and traveled to the mainland every second day or so. You must also visit the other islands for a look at how the people live. So much to see and do in Hong Kong, go for a longer time and really enjoy it. Look at websites and other write ups from travel advisers. Take your time and plan before you go. It's my number one city in the World, fabulous Hong Kong!!"

He gave this idea of watching the view of Hong Kong skyline from the peak which has to be done after the sunset.On the same day me and my wife went to Victoria peak to see Hong Kong by night. The view from the peak was really amazing!!..Specially when start to get darker and all the lights start to iluminate the city. Such a beautiful view and a unique experience seeing Hong Kong by night from the peak. The next evening we decided to watched the laser show from the other side of the island. It was holiday season and some of the buildings has a christmas decorations and christmas lights. The show of the laser display together with the christmas lights was stunning and wonderful landmark. Hong Kong skyline was a really the best of the best. We also took the star ferry sightseeing tour by night and the skyline was much better seing from the boat...Never miss Hong Kong skyline!!!.."

It is also great to use one of the many ferries that shuttle between Hong Kong Island and Kowloon. There are not many cities in the World where you can watch the sea traffic at the same time.

It's best to go on a clear day and best to go an hour or so before sunset because there are also spectacular views of the bay the other side from the city view. It can get chilly and windy up there (Dec/Jan) and once you go down stairs you are not allowed back up. Following the sunset you can just watch all the lights come on in the city as it gets darker. Then get another perspective of the skyline from the Avenue of Stars and Star Ferry trip. Again, aim for a clear day (it was bright blue skies when I was there) and I would imagine this makes it all the more amazing!"

It is highly recommended that you make a trip to the Avenue of Stars in the early evening about 5.30pm and take a nice sunset stroll along the avenue and watch as the lights come on one by one. The gusts from the cold wind as we went there during winter made the experience so much better too. Also, be sure to try the grilled shredded squid, it's really delicious. However I would recommend going on a weekday as the day that I went was thronged with tourists from tour groups and they were all scrambling to take pictures with Bruce Lee and cutting lines. End the night with a relaxing ferry ride to HK island via the Star Ferry to visit the IFC opposite and take the escalator up to the roof garden. It provides a nice view of the Kowloon Harbor from the HK island side. And It's free!! Overall a million dollar view and it is a must see when in HK. A big pity about some of the rude scrambling tourists. PS : for those wears ng caps, be cautious as the wind blew off my cap a couple of times, but luckily not into the sea :)"

Extra bonus if you can enjoy the view from day time changing to night as the view is spectacular, especially the view from The Peak. Also, one should enjoy the view from the ferry travelling from the mainland to HK Island. You will get two different views across the water. Two things cross my mind when I was there to enjoy the view from different angle \u2013 one being how congested certain part of Hong Kong with all the tall buildings standing very close to each order and narrow street. Second \u2013 the amount of electricity utilized/supplied to all the commercial and residential buildings that normally light-up till midnight.Nonetheless, the view of Hong Kong skyline should not be missed by any visitors"

In the History and Science Museum buildings there are some restaurants and bathrooms. Not easy to spot the entrance, but it's somewhere there. You could also use the facilities of the SOGO shopping mall (just opposite the entrance of Nathan Road)The bad: it's often, especially in the evening, overcrowded. All the city's tourists gather here like some cult-sect followers to watch the free 10minute light-show (the show is really nothing special, but you will have the feeling to have missed something great -and free- if you don't watch it). tip:1. if you really want to watch the light show, try to go to the second floor of one of the adjacent buildings (Museum of Science), it's usually less crowded. 2. if you are a morning person, you could enjoy sunrise here, because most people are not, you will be able to enjoy it all by yourself, in a surreal empty Hong Kong."

The setting sun amid the tall buildings across the harbor was also quite a spectacle so try to go to the Avenue of Stars as early as 5 or 5:30 pm so you can watch the beautiful changing of the afternoon skies. The long wait for the Symphony of Lights might bore you though (show starts at 8:00 pm) so you have the option to walk around the area again and just come back by by 7:30 pm so you can still get a good seat on the promenade."

On my travels I usually tend to stay in cheaper rooms but in Hongkong I spent money I could have bought a nice laptop with on my room, a suite on top of Bishop Hotel and for me it was worth it. Enjoying the skyline of Hongkong from your bed is a very special experience you won't forget. Only topped by sitting alone on West High Peak with a 360\u00b0 view after I almost had to be saved by the Hongkong mountain rescue service because I had tried to get a very special but a little dangerous view.At least take the ride up to Victoria Peak and take the fantastic 30 minutes hike around. Its called Pok Fu Lam Tree Walk."

The hotel is very clean, well-located, quiet and artistically designed and decorated. More importantly, their staffs are probably the most helpful, pleasant, and effective one I have ever met.We checked in after midnight and check out before 6 AM [Nov. 8-Nov 12, 2012], the same Asst. Guest Service Manager, Florence Ng, a young lady, was on duty on both occasions. When we checked in, she went out of her way to help us push our luggage cart from the street corner to the hotel, together with the porter Edmond. When we checked out, she carried our luggage for us and saw us off at the door. Florence was so helpful and pleasant that we felt completely at home during our stay. The porter, Edmond, is also very helpful young man. Another staff, Kevin even let us use his cell phone to call long distance\u2026. Everyone was so wonderful. The room, linens, and sheets are very clean and all the necessary amenities are provided. The air-conditioning is very efficient and the air circulation is excellent. The location is very good. It is in an alley but only a few steps from the main streets. Our room is very quiet.In all, even the Insight Vacation Tour hotels and their staff we have experienced, are no comparison to those at Madera Hong Kong and its super staff. We had a wonderful stay and experience at Madera. Professor Leo Liu, Ph.D., and Shirley LiuRichmond, British Columbia, Canada"

We visited on Nov 2nd 2012 the American Express Hong Kong Wine & Dine Festival for the first time which is an epicurean feast of wine-themed events organised yearly by the Hong Kong Tourism Board.We enjoyed strolling along the wine booths (my guess about more than 200 wine booths) with the view of Hong Kong Skyline and harbour for wine tasting from around the world (At the entrance, you can buy a Classic Wine Pass /tokens package for 2 person : HKD300 with 15 tokens/ 2 wine glases and holder, a very nice souvenier to take home)and the gourmet food stalls offering Dutch, Italian and French cheeses, Italian Ham and many others foods.We bought a very nice Dutch old cheese to bring home to KL...The festival is free to all those visiting, you just only need to pay for food and for wine wit your tokens at the stands which are priced fairly reasonably. A free bus shuttle service is available (run every 5 minutes) from MTR Kowloon Station or East Tsim Sha Tsui stations to the West Kowloon Promenade.Overall, it was a very nice and well organized festival to visit specially when the night starts to fall and the Hong Kong skylines takes a very a different view under a pleasant November weather and a nice glass of wine. Next year event will be held from 31st October to 3rd November 2013 so it is definitely to plan again to visit this event next year."

We enjoyed the view from the terrace on the 21st floor (WoolooMooloo restaurant) on 100 Nathan Road.(Shopping Mall The One) Be sure to be there on time because terrace seats are first come first serve.

From the West end of Avenue of the Stars you soon come to the Ocean Terminal mall, with quite a choice of restaurants (some of them ever so pricey - we went for the mid-range Nha Trang - Vietnamese)."

So on my first night in town, while dining at Cafe Deco on Victoria Peak, I moved to the window at 8pm. I noticed some light beams, but couldn't really figure out what the 'show' was. I was very disappointed. The next day we had a private tour and I told the guide of our experience. He told us it is better to view from the Kowloon side (you see more of the lights), and stand in front of the cultural center (right by Star Ferry), as the cultural center plays music that goes along with the show. So we watched the next night - much better!! Bottom line, best place to watch is from the cultural center so you can hear the music AND see all the lights. It was good. But still, I wouldn't go out of your way to see it. If you are in the area, stop in for the 15 minute show. But don't plan you day around it."

I've been to Hong Kong a couple of times, and have been to the harbour numerous occasions to look at the night lights of Hong Kong island and i never get bored of it.Despite it being in the middle of busy Hong Kong, i find it surprisingly relaxing. The nightly symphony of lights at 8pm is a must see. It's best viewed from Kowloon looking over the harbour onto Hong Kong island. You can do it the other way round, but you'll find it's best being on Kowloon side. Theres commentary at the start and then music, and the commentary broadcasts in English on Mon, Wed & Fri.If you're lucky enough to have a Hotel room that looks over the harbour, and you're in your room during the light show, you can listen to the narration and music on 103.4FMThe view of Hong Kong at night is also great, viewed from 'The Peak'Now, the view of Hong Kong from a plane is altogether a different experience. The view from the ground looks wonderful, but whilst flying home the other night, the plane flew along and round the harbour before heading away from Hong Kong and the view at night was just magical."

If you have 20 minutes to spare, go ahead and do this.Get there 15 minutes before so you can actually stand by the railing for an unobstructed view. The Hong Kong skyline at night rivals that of New York in my opinion as it has the harbor as a bonus. The light show was not spectacular (albeit good), but it's really the night skyline that will mesmerize you. The neon lights bounce off the water while one or two festive boats float by. The breeze is cool, and in that moment you get a glimpse of magical Hong Kong. Find time to pause and take it all in. Then go if you must (laser show notwithstanding)."

The answer is it does but it is ever changing so will not be the same the next time you go. It is so varied the new and old squashed together surrounded by green mountainous terrain. Whoever thought hong kong was just the island was very much mistaken. We loved the mix of the old and the new and the promenade that was just outside our hotel on the Kowloon side. We would highly recommend staying in a nice hotel on Kowloon like ours as is is this way you get to see the skyline day and night outside your window then stay on the island itself to be in the thick of it."

I could sit on the river walk and stare at the harbor and skyline all day. Every night at 8:00pm, there is a show called \"Symphony of Lights\" in which lights decorate the skyline set to music. People begin lining the \"Avenue of Stars\" about 1 hour prior to the shows start. I was one of these people. When the show began, I started laughing hysterically. There were really bad laser effects, cheesy chasing lights on buildings, and occasional flashes of colored lights in the sky. I imagine the show was really cool circa 1990, but it appears really dated and, well, lame. What was even funnier was all of the tourists that were taking millions of pictures of it. My Christmas tree is more entertaining. If you are hoping for a good laugh, this will provide!"

You are about 30 feet (10M) up and all on your own with no one blocking your view as you can get down by the harbour rail! Operates everynight at 20.00 and has music which co-ordinates with the light shows from the 30 or 40 building that take part. One specail days, like chiense New Year there are fire works too, but I have never seen that. You can also be on the Hong Kong side for another veiw but this is not so spectacular."

I personally didn't find the 8pm light show all that \"spectacular\" however the colloseum did look really good, along with some other indivudual buildings. Personally I would say the view from Avenue of the stars is better than the one experienced from the peak (a lot cheaper as well). All in all, the chances are if you're in Hong Kong you'll see the skyline anyway, however if your stay is extremely brief ensure you do take a walk along the front of Kowloon at night for that jaw dropping view of the most spectacular urban sight in the world."

On the expressway in from the airport, if it's a clear day (rarely!), the city creeps up on you. First-time visitors if you're staying on Hong Kong Island take a taxi from the airport to get a real idea of the scale of Hong Kong. The road winds up the coast of Lantau, through tunnels and huge bridges until you begin to make out that spectacular city scape. Through the Western Harbour Tunnel and you're out among skyscrapers. It really is one of the best city arrivals in the world, rivalled in my view only by New York. Unlike New York however most of Hong Kong's buildings don't bear close inspection, though there are some gems such as the HSBC building and The Bank of China.The light show - well, see it once. You probably won't want to see it twice, as it's a bit small for the scale of the city in my opinion, and a precious waste of electricity."

Perhaps I will go again one day, hopefully on a better day. I can recommend that you travel to Hong Kong to see it but, make sure it is on a good day.

Either way it would have to rival, if not better, New York for its Splendour.

It has been seen a million times but the real experience is still better :) Especially on Hong Kong Island, there's a ton of skyscrapers. My personal favourite is the Band of China Tower (the crystal shaped one) where you can go on the 43th floor for free and enjoy an amazing view on Victoria Harbour and the other multistory buldings. Most of the skyscrapers are illuminated at night which can be seen best from Kowloon, especially from the Tsim Sha Tsui Promenade. At 8 pm there is the \"Symphony of Lights\" a 20 minute-lightshow which is nice to see. If you want to experience the vastness of Hong Kong concrete jungle you should take the tram to \"The Peak\". It leaves close to Central station, is a bargain and allows you the have a brilliant view on the skyline, particularly during and after sunset."

This was from the days of Kai Tak airport being located in Kowloon East, and the landing path had to be kept low over the city. Everything higher than that has been built since the airport moved in 1997; there must be hundreds of skyscrapers built in just 15 years."

One of my favourite ways to show off Hong Kong's skyline is to take the person visiting Hong Kong and walk them up to The Peak. Sure, you can take the bus or the tram, but walking up allows the skyline to slowly reveal itself to you - and it's a great way to get a bit of exercise in the HKG outdoors...They say Hong Kong is a concrete jungle, but there are actually some great trails hidden in between the tall buildings, and lots of trees. Bring enough water as it's very humid in the tropics, and of course, bug spray!From Central, you can start this walk in Lan Kwai Fong. Walk up Glenealy, you'll walk through an underpass to cross Caine Road, keep on Glenealy until you hit Robinson Road. The walkways and bridges can get confusing here, but turn left on Robinson until you get to Old Peak Road. Walk steep uphill, you will go past Canossa Hospital and the Ladies Recreational Club. Follow Old Peak Road as it veers to the right, until the car road becomes a pedestrian path. If you want to cheat this first bit which can be confusing, take a cab and ask them to drop you off outside Dynasty Court Tower 2, or where Tregunter Path hits Old Peak Road.At this point, you are in the pedestrian path of Old Peak Road, which is too narrow for cars. This is the original path leading up to the Peak. Imagine over a hundred years ago when rickshaws were the only option, now walk uphill.All you need to do at this points is keep walking uphill. No shops or drinks stands along the way... but what you will notice is the Hong Kong sky unfolding and revealing itself in front of you. This walk is especially beautiful at night. It will take 30 - 45 minutes to walk uphill so try to leave around 7pm so that you can get up to The Peak by the 8pm lights show.The only fork in the road is when you get to Epworth Lodge, junction of Old Peak Road and Barker Road. Turn sharp right - this will lead you to the steps leading up to The Peak Tower.Once you make it to the top... dinner at Peak Lookout - you've earned it after that hike! Have the curry - or else something from the Asian Selection. An outside table is nice if there is a cool breeze..."

            "review": "One of the two best skylines in the world along with NYC. In terms of skylines, Hong Kong Island is in elite company along with its only true rival, New York City. Luckily the Hong Kong Skyline is not something easily missed as it dominated much of what you can see from the popular Kowloon and HK Island areas where you will likely spent most of your time when visiting Hong Kong. Thus, you won\u2019t help but have many opportunities to admire the views. There are many places to view Hong Kong's lovely skyline. Our favourite place is the TST Promenade and Avenue of Stars, looking over Victoria Harbour directly at the Hong Kong Island skyline. This image is beautiful in the morning and when the sun is at your back, allowing you to see the skyline with a blue sky behind Victoria Peak. However, the very best time to see the fantastic Hong Kong skyline is at night when the buildings are lit up and reflecting off of the harbour. From Kowloon, you can also enjoy excellent views of the Hong Kong Skyline from several bars on high floors; such as the popular Aqua Bar (30/f of Peking One Road) or the new and incredibly high Sky100 and Sky bar (118th/f) at the International Commerce Center (ICC). Other popular Kowloon based viewing areas include Felix Bar at the famous Peninsula Hotel as well as the lobby and restaurants at the Intercontinental Hotel. You can also enjoy the skyline by taking the famous Star Ferry, Aqua Luna or other ferry ship across the lovely Victoria Harbour. This is one of our favourite ways to view the skyline as we can have a look at both sides of the harbour. From Hong Kong Island views of the Kowloon skyline are quite nice from the Star Ferry piers, the IFC building and shopping mall in Central and from various points in Admiralty, Wan Chai and Causeway Bay where you can grab a view of the harbour. However the best views from the HK Island side come from visiting the world famous Victoria Peak with its glamorous views of HK Island skyscrapers, Victoria Harbor and the Kowloon Skyline. Like views from the TST Promenade, this classic postcard image is good in the morning, evening and when the sun is at your back. But the best view is in the evening when you can see the endless skyscrapers lit up against the darkness of night. The major limitation to the Hong Kong Skyline is the poor air quality we often have in Hong Kong, compared to the many beautiful days you might have in NYC, HK routinely has long stretches of poor visibility so it is possible to visit for entire week and not get a single day with very good visibility. Knowing this, visitors can plan better for their HK trip, being flexible with their schedules and ready to spend time on and near the harbour when they have days with clear skies. This is the best way to ensure that time is allowed for admiring one of the two best skylines in the world."
