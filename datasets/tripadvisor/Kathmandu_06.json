He offered very deep pressure and accurate palpation to find all of my trigger points. All of the therapists at seeing hands receive extensive training in massage therapy (and even some chiropractic training) from the UK. I was surprised to receive an adjustment at the end, but felt safe and adjusted easily after the massage. I wouldn't go anywhere else and will return many times while I visit Nepal. They offered dim lighting, a comfortable massage table and music. The price is great for the quality. It's always nice to leave a little tip if you feel they are deserving for their great work."

My massage therapist was Santos & he was great at being attentive, focusing on the areas of need, & very professional. The staff were all very friendly and efficient. I will come back here when I come back to Kathmandu. My husband really loved his massage as well, he had a guy as well, I think his name was Ganga."

After refering to another very expensive massage spa then walking around to find the right location in a quiet corner of bustling Thamel without booking in advance, I was welcomed by the warm hospitality of all staff in Seeing Hands.Same to many of you guy who tried several kinds of massage in different countries, I was surprised at how professional the staffs in the clinic are. My masseuse (Her name is Bhima, I suppose) knew exactly where I got hurt and gave me useful advices. It was amazing when my serious headache reduced much right after the massage. My flight back to homeland was better thanks to her skillful hands. Thank you for such a good experience! It's always worth a try to give support to real social enterprise like Seeing Hands Nepal."

Kindly ask the therapist to walk you at the massage rooms, there you will see that it's clean and comfy.There is a music as a background (I read reviews that said there wasn't) but sometimes you get some noise out of the window.. busy Thamel though!

This is by far the best massage I have ever had. I tipped my masseuse the price of the massage itself. She found all my trouble spots IMMEDIATELY and got rid of all of them. I had the very popular woman masseuse I think her name was Litska or something like that. It is written in some other reviews here! Either way, the bunch of them are so lovely and amazing. I had a hoot talk to them before my massage. They are very smart! You MUST try this place if you are looking for a massage."

The seeing hands clinic is run by a number of visually challenged fantastic human beings. They are outstanding in feeling your knots and working on them individually until they are sorted. The enthusiasm and positive energy these people bring in you are priceless. This is million dollar experience for anyone.

The masseuses were professional and kind, and I was very happy with my experience. It was definitely a different massage experience than I was used to, however- the lights are on, there is no music except the sound of the fan, you can hear the traffic and noise from the city around you, and the masseuses may make conversation with you throughout the massage. Don't let that discourage you though, it is well worth your time! I certainly look forward to going again in the future."

The facilities were super clean and comfortable, and that's saying a lot for Kathmandu. The restroom in reception had toilet paper! This is like spotting an endangered species in Nepal. We were in a room together for our massage. Our two masseuses (sp?) were friendly and super nice. Excellent conversational English. They laughed at my boyfriend's corny jokes. They seemed overall very dedicated and happy to do this work. Ganga was my masseuse. He worked out only about a zillion knots in my back and shoulders in a really short time. It was painful but amazingly rejuvenating. I was making all sorts of wimpy noises throughout, which we were all laughing about. I liked that the atmosphere was relaxed & not stuffy, like some USA spa/massage places can be. Afterwards, when we were paying at reception, some of the other masseuses (sp?) were in the room and all super friendly, asking if we enjoyed ourselves and where we were from. It happened to be our last day in town but had we visited earlier in our trip, I would have no doubt gone back. Ask for Ganga, he murdered my body (in a good way)."

            "review": "Really the best massage I've ever had by Laxmi. I don't usually leave reviews on tripadvisor although I've travelled to many countries. However, I really wanted to leave a quick note about this place. It's a small 2-story establishment in Thamel (be patient, you will find it, it's located at the end of the street and has a big sign) that is run and serviced by the blind. A colleague and I got one massage each and we both agreed that they were the best massages we both have ever experienced. First, we were running a little late due to the really bad traffic in Kathmandu and we also got a little lost on the way. I called and the person who answered the phone (who also did the massage on my colleague) gave instructions to our driver (while being blind!) and him and his wife waited for us to get there. Jaxmi worked on me, and I was a bit hesitant, because I've had lower back and hip issues, however she could tell exactly where all of my issues were without me saying a word. Their sense of touch is absolutely incredible. She said I could probably get rid of most of my issues if I had 2 or 3 more sessions and I think there might be some truth to that because my body felt incredible revived afterwards (and also tired). I will be sure to go back to them the next time I go to Nepal, becuase of the high quality of work that they do. I highly recommend it and hope folks like me will support this establishment because they really do an amazing job, sight or no sight."

Because they are blind they are much more sensitive which makes the massage a lot more intense. Furthermore I find the project good and worth supporting as the possibilities for blind people to find a job in Nepal are not many. You can choose between 3 different massage: Sport Therapy Remedial, Sweedish Relaxing Massage and Foot Massage.Furthermore you can choose between 1h or 1.5h. The cost are respectively $16 and $24.I went for the Sport Therapy Remedial which really cured all of my myalgia and loosened me up quite a lot. I can highly recommend Seeing Hands Clinic. So if you're in Kathmandu, make sure you have time to stop by this clinic, you won't regret it!"

I am also a masseuse and therefore highly critical but her massage was top standard.The only criticism I would have is the temperature. I was cold although it didn't spoil my treatment. Also the head cushion could do with being a little more comfortable as I felt I had my head on wood. She spent the whole hour on my back which was fine and it probably needed it. Although I would have kept some of my clothes on had I realised my legs weren't going to be posted. This is positive criticism and something with the right communication can easily be rectified.

The only thing i would say that if your looking for a relaxing massage then maybe consider one of the other clinics as you do get the street noise n dogs barking , but then your in the middle of KTM so its to be expected. It didnt bother me tho n didnt affect my experience at all. Il definetely be visiting again before i return home."

            "review": "Amazing Deep Tissue. After traveling for 2+ weeks, my back was killing me. Try as I might I could not find a chiropractor in Kathmandu. Fortunately, I packed pain killers and muscle relaxers, but they were only temporary fixes. With a day of sightseeing ahead of me, I thought I should start with a massage. Looking on Trip Advisor, Seeing Hands was the most highly recommended. However, that was not the determining factor. The fact that the massage therapists were blind led me to believe that that their other four senses, especially touch, would be particularly heightened, which would only enhance the massage experience. I was not wrong. Seeing Hands has three locations; one, in Patan, was a five minute walk from the Himalaya Hotel where I was staying (Exit the hotel, cross the street and turn left. Go two blocks and turn right. Walk about 300 feet. The Norwegian Embassy is on the right, Seeing Hands is just up ahead on the left.) It also happened to be the newest location and the least expensive of the three. The facilities were immaculate, cleaner than my hotel. I was met at the gate by Ramji, my massage therapist. His English was excellent (plus he was really easy on the eyes :-)). He asked me if I had any surgery , medical issues or pain that he should be aware of. I told him of my back problems, so he spent a lot of time on my back. He sense of touch was intuitive. He completely hit on the 3 pain points on my back, especially the two really sore ones. When I left, I was virtually pain free. Even now, eight hours after my massage, my back does not hurt. Back in the U.S. a 90 minute massage is way out of my price range. Here I can not only afford one, I can afford one every other day. I already made an appoint for Tuesday. I would unequivocally recommend this place for a solid deep tissue massage, especially with Ramji, although I am sure the others are great as well. One thing that I would recommend for Seeing Hands, as a few others have mentioned, is to keep speaking to a minimum and have some soothing meditative music playing. That would elevate the relaxation experience to another level. I can't wait for Tuesday... and Thursday... and Saturday... and even my last day, next Tuesday."

On my way I got lost and I bumped into the Seeing Hands Clinic, which had been my first choice. I was welcomed by a extremely polite and gentle young man who explained me the procedure and made me feel confortable. The massage was strong - my choice- and very well done. I am usually very critical about masseurs and massage parlours but the massage here was very professional and the feeling was Wonderful."

Normally, I exclusively request a female message therapist but I knew this guy would know what he was doing, and I am glad I trusted him.My back feels great. I had really come in for a more feel-good massage, but the Swedish is evidently great for working out the tension in your back (albeit, a bit painful). Regardless, he did an excellent job in getting the tension out of the middle & upper parts of my back. This is was the kind of back work where you absolutely need to be able to trust your message therapist, and I'm glad I trusted this establishment. I hadn't really had my back worked on like that before, but I can tell I needed it in retrospect.They have three or four different massages for you to choose from so the nature of the massage is up to you.Nothing but respect and admiration for this place and my message therapist. I also think that if you haven't spent time around people who cannot see, it is well worth your time as I have so much respect for them. They seem like great people. Hope they do well. Look forward to coming back someday. I recommend checking this place out at least once."

I wasn't sure if I wanted 90 minutes or an hour and retrospectively o wish I had gone for 90 minutes. I can't emphasise how great this massage was and how good I now feel (especially after a long trek in the Himalayas). I'm 100% going back for 90 minutes before I leave Nepal. This is the best thing I have done in Kathmandu and the whole ethos behind the organisation is so positive and something that everyone should support. Very reasonably priced, just fabulous."

Then he gives you the massage of your life and when he has finished you feel as though you have stepped into a brand new body. His talent for knowing EXACTLY where your pain is and how to work on it is uncanny.Chiran remembered me from my last visit in 2013, he recalled where I am from in the UK and all about the muscular problems that I had last time we met and even my daughters name.Chiran is totally blind, but God has given him a divine gift to heal others with his hands, and you should visit his clinic, not just because you are supporting an organisation that gives to work to the many blind and visually impared in Nepal, but because, this man can work miracles on your body.In fact they should rename it \" The Miracle Works \""

Our masseuses - Ram for me and Lalu for Caroline - have been simply excellent. Their treatments are first class and they are always careful to concentrate on any areas that are troubling us. We have had our treatment in the same room and in separate rooms - they will do whatever is most comfortable for you. The rooms are kept nice and warm (good at this time of year!). The price is a more than reasonable 1500rps (\u00a310) - hard to find a reason not to go for that price and the standard of treatment.

Laxmi took care of me this time and her hands were sure and confident and she massaged all the cricks and knots away that had collected from the bumpy roads and excessive walking! I appreciate the quality as I regularly have massages at home, and am quite picky about what is good or not ;-) so I was thankful that once again I received excellent massages (twice this visit!) and the friendly atmosphere of the clinic too ... beautiful!"

Seeing Hand Clinic is one of which I know of for some time and I visited there on 26/12/2013 and 27/12/2013 (and have 2x of massages). It is really beyond my expectation to receive such skillful massage/therapy as I do not anticipate the therapist (blind) would be able to detect the problems of my back and shoulder without me signalling a word (as I do have very frequent of massage \"tui na\" to solve my backache, sniffing neck and shoulder pain back in my home country). It is really amazing!I would highly recommend Seeing Hands Clinic for massage or therapy if you guys have a chance to visit Pokhara and Kathmandu. The rate offers is very reasonable. Each therapist is well-trained with their certificate display in the reception area. More importantly, lets support them for their surviving skills. Well done!"

Little did I know that I would get the best massage I have ever had and get my shoulder fixed at the same time. My massage was done by Chiran and he did a excellent job. I have dislocated my shoulder twice so my shoulder has been an issue for some time. I did four sessions with him and my shoulder feels amazing. It was much better after the second session and he started working on other areas more. The first session was spent purely on my shoulder. There were some times of heavy pain during the treatment as he went deep into the shoulder joint where the issues were, but it was definately worth it. I could not sleep on that shoulder for many years as it would hurt too much. I no longer have that problem and have a new confidence with my shoulder. I was always worried about putting my arm straight up in the air of fear of it dislocating it. That issue is also fixed. I have a new shoulder and will not get surgery on my shoulder which I was considering. Thanks Chiran for all your hard work. Amazing."

The people who are giving the massage are so pure and radiating positive energy, they are remarkable. They are blind but very skilled and speak very good English. Not to compare to all of the fake massage parlors in Kathmandu where rubbing smelly oil and happy endings is what they are trying to sell in a dirty, terribly filthy setting.Walking for hours in a stinking city which Kathmandu not so charmingly really is, a great massage at Seeing Hands made me new and vibrant again to happily go on another of my walks through this crowded and dirty city where beauty can be found where you least expect it.Willem Rieder"

What really got us was the sentence that they receive a 2 year training from Uk doctors. I had a male Massage therapist and i really didn't know what to expect. I never received a massage from a blind person before.I can say that it was hands down the best massage of my life.( i get a lot of massages as i spend a lot of time in asia) It was a very healing experience. He felt my body and the tight spots and worked through it. He was gentle, his english was perfect and he seemed like a very nice young man. One can really feel how sensitive and experienced the massage therapist are at seeing hands. Obviously their condition gives them a higher sensitivity for feeling. We extended while we are being massaged to a 1.5 houer session because it was that amazing. I could have done 4 hours. Seriosuly im already looking forward to come back to Kathmandu just to get this massage again. You are silly not to try it. It will change your life. Enjoy!"

Thank you - I just wish I could spend more time supporting this organization and benefiting from the incredible healing you provide."

In fact, I'd have to say it was the perfect post-trek massage, because she knew all the spots that would be hurting after a trek (calves, quads, back, shoulders etc). Frankly, I'd give just about anything to be back on that table now."

A massage here is a great way of helping some of the 160,00 blind people in Nepal and thats the reason that I personally went there.All the masseurs are blind, both men and women. I arrived in a good deal of pain and unable to walk, so I booked a massage with the proprietor, ' Chiren ', and I am not kidding when I say,\"I bet this man can walk on water !\", after a one hour massage I was able to walk again and had nowhere the amount of pains as when I arrived there. Chiren knows exactly where your pain is and works hard on you to get rid of it. The next day I was a little sore but by the following day all the soreness had gone and I was feeling good, so good in fact, that I went back to him three days later for a second session, I am now back in the UK and still feeling the benefits of his massages. Whilst I cannot say that his massage cured my chronic pain, which after all, is age related, but it did go a long way to releiving it and allowing me some small mobility. Chiren speaks excellent English and has a good sense of humour and a highly professional attitude.Do yourself a BIG favour, if you have any stiffness or nerve pain go to 'Seeing Hands', and get yourself the message to end all massages, it won't cost you a fortune and is worth every Ruppee !"

It wasn\u2019t real easy to find as I couldn\u2019t see any sign on the main street pointing to the right alley. Once I arrived, I was greeted by Santosh, who asked if I preferred a male or female therapist, so there is that option (personally, I don\u2019t care as long as they\u2019re good at it). He took me up to a private room. Unfortunately, he wasn\u2019t able to find a heater for the room so we moved to a table in a room that already had a client on the other table. I was concerned that there would be a lot of conversation between the two therapists as noted in reviews for the Pokhara clinic, but it was kept to a minimum. There was, however, some loud discussion between the other therapist and someone outside the door (I think about gas delivery?); as a massage veteran, I feel the massage room should be a sanctuary without interruption from the outside world.Santosh was a good massage therapist with very firm pressure, to the point of pain on my overworked calf muscles, but he eased up when requested. All in all, it was a good experience and very good value on many levels."

My only minor complaint was that during our massage (my husband and I were in the same room) the 2 therapists talked to each other quite a bit - and I prefer a quieter environment for massage. But the massage quality was excellent and the therapists (I had Ramsey both times - husband had Santoss and ... I forgot the other name) were so nice and personable. They spoke better English too than most people in Thamel! Massages when we went were 1500 rps/60 min and 2100 rps/90 min - so it equates to about $18 USD."

There is basically the same to say about both places: The different people that gave the massages were all very well trained and highly professional in giving a wonderful western-style massage. It was good fun to support such a great project that gives work to blind people. The people that treated me there were extremely nice and spoke good english - some of them were a little too talkative to really relax - but of course I would probably be same if I couldn't see the world and people around me.I would highly recommend this place for a general well-being massage if you have no acute pains which you want to have treated. For the latter I would rather go to places like Sotai in Kathmandu and Patan where the staff is perfectly trained in curing whatever discomforts you might bring to them.Many of the other \"specialised\" massage places around Thamel are not as professional as they might look like. Many are even brothels rather than massage parlours. A \"foot reflexology\" in many cases is often not at all related to the \"reflex\" points but rather a general lower leg massage. Many of the \"ayurvedic massage\" places are also not upto any standard one might expect. If you want a surely great treatment - in western style though - stick to blind massage. A safe bet!

The guys there were friendly, welcoming and gave me and my friends brilliant massages. We felt really comfortable and they were very attentive. I can't recommend coming to this place enough.

Sadly katmandu has a number of dubious massage places around and even the non dubious are probably not trained. nepal has no real tradition of massage so don't be fooled by any supposed traditional aspects. Seeing hands is new to katmandu but has been established in Pokhara for many years and this is simply an offshoot. Theres usually a westerner to oversee the work as its a charity and the blind practitioners are trained by them. Most seem to be chiropracters etc. Having had a few back problems in my time I was hopeful that they could sort out mine, which they did. Its not what they're there for (its supposed to simply be massage after all) but the level of expertise by these guys (and girls) is impressive. So if you've done your back in on a trek or simply want a relaxing massage then come here, its a great scheme and reasonable prices."

The two therapists that I saw (Laxmi and Santosh) had slightly different techniques, but both gave very professional massages, with just the right amount of pressure etc. Perfect for post-trekking or just to relax when the craziness of Kathmandu is getting a bit much for you. During June and July they were not too busy so it was easy to book an appointment. Well worth the extra rupees compared to some of the other massage places around."

I feel bad about writing a negative review, but I guess the point of tripadvisor is that you're honest, and I don't want others going with high expectations like I did. To be fair, when I left, I noticed in the review book some really great comments, but next to the girl's name that I had, someone else had also written a negative review.

They had a professional massage table, the rooms were spacious and they had a seperate shower/bathroom for customers to use.I had a female masseur who although was tiny was very stronge and was easily able to work on all of my aches and pains.

I haven't actually been to the clinic itself but I did receive a 10 minute sample by one of Seeing Hands massage therapists at their stall during the Barbar Mahal Revisited Night Bazaar. I'll be honest, the massage was quite painful but only because they are well-trained and know what they are doing. This isn't for someone who's looking for a simple relaxation massage during which they will fall asleep. If you are coming back from a trek or generally feel tight from your travels, the therapists at Seeing Hands will address every knot and ache you might have. I knew I was in desperate need of a tune up of the neck and back and in only 10 minutes, though quite painful, I walked away feeling looser, more relaxed and generally pain-free. I will be booking a full massage shortly to get the rest of the kinks worked out! Lastly, I'd like to mention that Seeing Hands is a wonderful organization that is doing a lot for the blind community in Nepal. The organization really is turning what many here believe to be a \"disability\" into a real gift."

Clinic was actually located 3 min from my hotel (Holy Himalaya Hotel).I have registered my visit in the morning and had this amazing massage the same evening after busy day. I've chosen 1h relaxing massage and that was absolutely enough - I wouldn't probably survive sporting or extreme massage. Everything was clean and fresh (really clean even up to European and American standards!) and price for such massage is so low - this is 'must do' when in Kathmandu. I was amazed how professional, calm and strong my massager was - I didn't know that I have so many points on my body which could provide so much pain, but he controlled that and not even once I had to say to stop - he knew exactly how strong he should massage me - absolutely stunning. Next time in Kathmandu I will be booking this massage probably for every single day; it is worth it and helps them as well to have decent job and salary. 5+ as a recommendation."

I heard about 'Seeing Hands' had opened a clinic in Kathmandu so thought to check them out. Wow! Not only was it an excellent quality of deep tissue massage, the whole atmosphere was very welcoming, clean and safe. By far 150% better than the average massage clinic in Kathmandu! Plus the anatomical knowledge of the practitioner was above average. Highly recommend. Especially for solo women, who might have reservations of getting a massage, they have women & male practitioners, but all are 'safe' in my experience so far. I will be back! thanks guys ..."

My wife and I have been going to the same masseuse in Sydney for the past 12 years, and whilst travelling it is very difficult to find one of a similar standard. However this was not the case with Chiran at Seeing Hands Massage where we received a great deep tissue sports massage, both before and after our trek in the Himalayas.I would highly recommend the massage to anyone going to Kathmandu, plus it is good to know that you are helping to support such a worthy organisation."

We were originally attracted by the idea that this was a charity clinic, but became repeat clients because of the exceptional skills of the therapists. I get regular massages back home in Canada, and my massages here were among the best I've ever received. The massage therapist manged to find and get out knots in an extremely skillful manner. I was amazed by how good I felt after the massage. I highly recommend this clinic. You will not be disappointed."

It was really great meeting at Real Therapy and Beauty Points explores the great shows from its presentation not from loud words, everyone feels unique and quite distinct experiences of hot water pond, dry sauna, steam sauna, whole body massage, relaxing group foot massage, hot stone massage, deep tissue massage and with great hospitality manner. I salute Mr. Bhabi Sharma +0977 9851089169 for introducing the very natural healing service in Nepal specially in Thamel. I would like to recommend to my friends to go once for life time memory and pleasure. i can't forget lemon water when i was inside steam sauna."

Unfortunately, the 2nd time, the spa was packed, which caused problems with scheduling, and a rushed, less-than-great atmosphere.The pros: the spa is very well equipped and professional - it's not a \"joint.\" They have a locker room, showers, sauna and steam room, and the massage rooms are OK. (no music or candles, though, which is a pity). They give you slippers and towels, and there's a waiting area.I had a swedish massage both times.First time was a dream! She really knew what she was doing, and it was as good as any massage I've had anywhere in the world.When I returned 2 days later -- after having scheduled for a specific hour and a specific person - the waiting area was full. My partner and I were then rushed to a room together, and the 2 masseuses chatted between themselves. I asked them to observe the quiet.The shower/locker room was very crowded.Lesson learned: GO EARLY IN THE DAY. The evening becomes too rushed, and affects the experience. When it's good, it's great."

There are also sauna and steam bath, you choose one before your treatment to warm up the body.

To be honest the only reason I came here was because a friend gave me a 20% off services card, but little did I know I would be one lucky girl to have received it.As soon as I entered Kinjalla I was warmly greeted with a \"Namaste\" said in unison, hands to heart, by all the present staff. Invited to take a seat, the manager handed me a menu with a large variety of services at surprisingly low prices.After a bit of questioning and honest suggestions/answers from the kind, attentive manager, I was guided through a sliding door where I was met with nothing less than a clean, well maintained, spa. I was truly impressed with the quality of my surroundings.In the first room I received a full leg and underarm waxing where the well trained ladies did their best to remove EVERY hair. It was a lengthy procedure, but nonetheless I was pleased with the finished product.Next, I was taken to a smaller private room for my 60 minute Swedish massage and all I can say is WOW. After given the choice of a male or female masseuse, (female of course), I received the woman who worked on my waxing so I was already comfortable with her presence and touch. I can't speak for all of the workers, but if any of them produce a massage like she does then you can't go wrong! I was so relaxed and her techniques were extremely effective in reaching what felt like every muscle in my body!Lastly, I was pampered like a princess during my duo mani-pedi with exfoliation, lotions, and more massage accompanied, of course, with a hot cup of tea offered by the manager who occasionally checked on me to make sure all was well.To top it all off, upon the completion of my services I was kindly awarded with yet another 25% discount for my next visit AND a complimentary foot massage! Again, the total price was very inexpensive for all the work I received. During my stay I was comfortable and well looked after. Needless to say I left a happy, satisfied customer and will definitely be returning.The only down side I would say was the length of time my beauty services took. If you come to this spa make sure you have the time and be ready to be treated like a queen (or king!)."

I had such a wonderful experience there between the yoga class I took and the full spa day package I did. First, the yoga classes are all very nice, with good teachers who each bring their uniqueness to the class. I appreciated that the teachers were so friendly. They offer many different types of yoga classes, so whether you're into yin, Ashtanga, or vinyasa, there is a class here for you.Now...the full day spa package. You must do it if you have time and are looking to treat yourself. At a great price - you get multiple spa treatments, breakfast and lunch, as well as a morning yoga class, and meditation at the end of the day. Also, the massage therapists are so caring and thoughtful. They really take care of you and make sure that you are comfortable and relaxed. It was a perfect way to end my month of travel in the beautiful country of Nepal.Also, the owners are super friendly and welcoming. It's inspiring to know how much the founder has invested into the study of yoga and sharing it with others, as well (you can find his bio on their website).Overall, this was a wonderful experience. Thank you to Mandala Studio for a lovely time!"

I found Kritis yoga studio during my visit to thamel. Even though I was reluctant that I would find a good teacher there. Kriti's skill as a Yoga Instructer is above exceptional. I was so impressed with her teaching knowledge and experience that I took a month long teacher training course from her in hatha Yoga. Currently I am doing Vinyasa Yoga teacher training from Kriti. Thank you Kriti and Mandala Yoga studio staff and friends for looking after me, without doubt I will be a lifelong learner at your studio."

And each time I sojourn in KTM, for no reason would I miss out on the opportunity to grant a visit to the Mandala Yoga Studio located in Sagarmatha Bazaar (Mandala Street). I have not (yet) used their yoga facilities per se, but have extensively benefited from numerous sessions of massage there. If like me, you like to \"pamper\" your muscles, joints & even soul after intensive & strenuous physical efforts, then the Mandala Yoga Studio is THE place to recover & deeply relax in Thamel:1) The massage facilities are outstandingly CLEAN (and I have benchmarks, for having visited most of the massage studios in Thamel). They are COZY, with an ELEGANT & NATURAL touch, inviting you purposefully to relaxation & stillness2) The staff is amazingly KIND AND QUALIFIED, being genuinely attentive to bringing the best experience to their customers. I have been very well taken care of during my stays, and can highly recommend in particular 2 incredible women practitioners, Kriti & Sonam. They live their art not just with their \"magic fingers\" but with their entire mind & soul. They are experienced, qualified, knowledgeable, kind & luminous.Go and pay the Mandala Yoga Studio a visit. It is worth it!"

Mandala studio is located just above one of my favorite coffee shops in Thamel in the the middle of town, so there's no going out of your way to get there. Dipendra taught the yoga class and was really passionate about challenging his students and taking his time (he actually gave optional 30 minutes of extra instruction at the end for us to practice various inversions). The massage was lovely (they ask and take into account how much pressure and if you have medical conditions), my masseuse took her time and went above and beyond what I was expecting. The facilities are clean, open, bright, and well decorated."

I had Jane and Kriti as my yoga instructors and would highly recommend taking their classes (Beginner Yoga, Vinyasa Flow, Hatha Yoga). They make sure that you get your basic poses right. My highlight was my trekkers' massages here by a petite woman masseuse whose name started with S. (I'm sorry!!). If you can track her down, I'd REALLY recommend her. I've received massages from the U.S., Korea, China, Thailand, Poland and I must say this was probably the best I've had.

Lots of time spent laying in different positions and teacher kept leaving the studio while we were left doing nothing. Class finished on time even though it was late starting and teacher left the building before we had even put mats away. Both the other girl and I explained our awful experience to the receptionist who accepted the other girl only pay half (rs.350) but he still didn't have change for me. I explained I would have a coffee downstairs and give him an opportunity to get the refunded money he had agreed to. He did come down to where I was having a coffee but not to give me agreed change but demanded I go back up to the studio where he had called back the yoga teacher.

I took the first level introduction Reiki course with Kriti and it was one of the most incredible, life-changing experiences; Kriti is a wonderful, kind teacher who told me so much about the philosophy behind yoga and Reiki that I had never known before. I am so grateful to her for sharing her knowledge about yoga and Reiki! I would recommend this course to anyone, even if you know nothing about Reiki; it will really change the way you look at yourself and the world."

Th yoga class was small, only four of us, and the teacher was great. She was friendly and kept things moving quickly but still took time to help us when we didn't understand or weren't doing it right, without making us feel bad or awkward. The massage after was one of the best I've had. I asked for medium pressure and wish it would've been a bit harder, but still was amazingly relaxing. Thought it was a bit expensive after being in Thailand and Southeast Asia, but it's prices were pretty competitive for the Thamel area (still way cheaper than in the USA) and definitely worth it."

I've tried yoga many times back in the U.S., but I never what I've always hoped for out of it. From the first class, I knew I have found my Yoga Home! The staff is very friendly, the studio is beautiful and the location is central. The Mandala Studio strikes an impossible equation of being that oasis of serenity in the middle of the hustle and bustle of Thamel The main teacher/guru, Kriti, is such an amazing talent. She is able to give individual attention without taking away from other students. She always encouraged me to take on challenges that absolutely shocked me when I was able to achieve them. As for the Spa, the facilities are fantastic including a steamroom and sauna while the masseuses are well versed in the different massaging styles, delightful and professional. As I said, I came for a yoga session and stayed to become a yoga teacher - what a life changing experience!"

I\u2019m a regular in yoga so when I had some free time during my travel in Nepal, the thought of joining a yoga session came impromptu. I approached the guest house owner of where I stayed for some recommendations and he introduced me to Mandala Studio. Mr Biren the owner came personally to the guest house to meet me and later took me to the studio for a visit. The first impression was good. It has a decent three-wall mirrored yoga classroom & spa (massage) rooms. I wasn\u2019t too keen on the latter but I returned the same day afternoon for vinyasa flow yoga. All I can say is I love it! The teacher was great, the classroom was clean, the ambience was fantastic, they practised good hygiene and yoga mat was provided. Guess what?! I returned the next morning for another round of Hatha yoga. I had such pleasant experience with Mandala and it\u2019s worth checking out. Location wise it was great too, at Mandala Street a little away from the noise in Thamel."

The staff is so great that I decided to complete my 200 hour Yoga Teacher Training at Mandala. Not only is it the cheapest World Alliance course I have seen in ANY country ($800 USD), the method of teaching and style is authentic. If you are looking to understand yoga and meditation in a deeper way, more than the \"exercise trend\" it had become, this is the place. A nice bonus is that free massages and treatments come with the yoga packages! Mandala has become like my home and its staff my Nepali family. I will greatly miss all, and thank them for the life lessons and skills to improve my health and build my yoga business!!!"

Gives me a wonderful deeper inside into the science and pratice of Yoga. Kriti, our teacher, emphasizes a wholesome few on Yoga, not only as a workout session. One of the things I really enjoy is, that I can go further and deepening my knowledge and capacities in Yoga, and yet have a everyday life - not like a training in an ashram, which might be pretty different. The studio is in beautiful Mandala Street, center of Thamel. It has a nice roof top, small and pretty studio room with mirrors to check your postures and give yourself a smile. They also offer massages, steam and sauna - I'm going to check that out soon ;)Just pop by for a Yoga drop-in class and see yourself!"

As they say you get what you pay for, it couldn't be more true here. Yes, you may pay a bit more here, but try it and you will see just how worth it, it is. We tried others in Thamel and Pokhara and they didn't come close. For us hygiene is important and Ananda has clean linen with each client. The aruyvedic is one of our favourites and it's like they know all your sore spots and work on them. Afterwards we feel totally blissed out and relaxed. The therapists here well trained and extremely professional, we can't praise them enough. Thank you, we'll be back"

In the end I had 4 massages from Ananda including foot, head/shoulders, deep tissue, and \"fusion.\" Although you can find cheaper massages in Kathmandu, I've had my share of poor quality \"budget\" massages around the world from inattentive and unskilled \"therapists\" and felt that this was still a great value for what you get--certainly significantly less than I would pay at home but more enjoyable than most massages I get at home as well! I found the facility to be very inviting and comfortable including a locker for your personal belongings, clean massage rooms, relaxing environment, and incredibly friendly staff. I loved my initial masseuse Mina and booked all subsequent massages with her. I loved Mina's strong confident touch but she also is careful to check in frequently to make sure the pressure is what you want. She is attentive to your comfort and uses a variety of techniques that I found very therapeutic for resetting my body after trekking, long travel, or just because it feels good. :) I would recommend Ananda to anyone looking for a good quality massage in Kathmandu in a comfortable environment. Thanks Mina and Ananda!"

Massage is really enjoyable, relaxing both body and mind and all this within a very competitive price range. Everyone at Ananda is friendly and extremely attentive making your time there, however short, enjoyable and rejuvenating. Make time in your schedule in Kathmandu to visit Ananda, it is well worth the effort and will only be the first of the many visits you are likely to make to this little jewel of a spa. Chris"

Let me start by saying that Thamel is literally packed with places that purport to be \"massage centers\" and \"spas\". And many of those places will list prices that are incredibly low and look extremely tempting. When my girlfriend and I settled into our 2 weeks in Thamel, we walked around and visited a lot of those places that looked so attractive online. The truth is that many of those are operations with questionable sanitary practices, run by people who are much more business-person (cut costs to the bare bones, etc) than actually therapy-focused.It was with that background that we felt so lucky when the proprietor of our place (Cafe Mitra... it's a gem!) told us about Ananda. Upon walking in, you can feel that this place is different. All the little touches that really shape the experience (lockers, music, tea, cleanliness, etc) set the stage for what is a really solid massage experience. They offer all different types of massage (Ayurvedic, Swedish, Thai, Shirodhara, etc) and really put an emphasis on meeting their clients where they are. The different masseurs certainly offer different levels of firmness, but all of them are attentive, friendly, and well-trained. (Sidenote: Gita comes highly recommended by both of us for a firm massage)The prices are a bit higher than you'll see online for other fly-by-night companies, but I urge you to think about the reason you're getting a massage in the first place. To relax and take care of your health. This place will help you do that."
