My hotel was at Beyazit area and I walked to Eminonue squre. From there bought a bus card and asked the number from a window. Then sat in the bus and after 15 minutes reached at the complex. After visiting went to the Piarlote park situated behind. Sat there and had Turkish tea."

You'll see newly married couples coming for blessings, little boys dressed extravagantly (awaiting their circumcision!) and pilgrims from around Turkey. Its in a residential district and you'll see a lot more skull caps and headscarves than you'll ever see in SultanAhmet or Taksim. Visit to get a sense of religious Turkey. Its an easy bus ride from the Eminonu bus station - just ask anyone how to get to Eyup and ask the bus conductor to let you know when you're there. Shouldn't take more than 15 minutes."

For Muslims it is believed that the tomb of Ayyub al Ansari, a companion of the Prophet Muhammad, is located there. Historians believe it was discovered by Mehmet the Conquerer prior to the conquest of Constantinople. Though the Blue Mosque is considered as the flagship mosque of Istanbul the holiest mosque is the Eyup Sultan Mosque. The ambience of the surrounding area with the food and gift shops is great. It is also located close to the cable car which accesses the Pierre Loti restaurant with fabulous views over looking the Golden Horn. It is well worth the visit but the queues can be fairly long. Alternatively there is a pathway access to the top. We decided to take the Cable car up and path back down and the kids loved the walk. From Sultanahmet Eyup is easily accessed by ferry which only cost 4 TL which is added bonus with great views of Istanbul from the Golden Horn. From SultanAhmet catch the tram to Eminonu. A short distance is a ferry port Emin\u00f6n\u00fc Hali\u00e7 \u0130skelesi where you can catch a ferry to Eyup. The mosque complex is only 5 minute walk from the port. We went with a view of spending half a day but ended up spending most of the day there. All in all it is great day trip if you include ferry ride, cable car and the visit to Pierre Loti."

We took a ferry over rather than other transport. It was very busy an takes around 30 mins, once you get off follow the hustle bustle of people through the market stalls until you reach a square. There we prayed Asar salah and then went to the mezar to offer our respects and make dua for all. Stunning mosque inside the mens section attached to the mezar. Not far is the telephonic (something like that) cable cars that take you up to a view point. Nice views but ques can be very long. Theres only 4 cable cars each seats 8 people. We waited for ages and missed our last ferry back, but worth a visit if you fancy it. Enjoy."

Mostly Muslims who come to pay tribute to Abu Ayyub Al-Ansari - a close companion of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH). He was named after the biblical Job. Abu Ayyub was one among the Ansar meaning aiders, helpers or patrons, of early Muslim history or those who supported the Prophet after the migration to Medina in 622 (wikipedia). This is a spiritual journey, we were able to visit the mosque because it was my mother's wish. Took a cab from Basileus Hotel and arrived here in about 20-30 mins. The area has more serious, spiritual, typical muslim overtones with majority of the locals coming in from different parts of Turkey to pay their respects. There are prayer beads, prayer caps and prayer mats being sold everywhere. Someone or the other is always offering people sweetmeats because a child is born, or a child has passed exams or something similar. As a Muslim I always say yes and take a bite, why? I don't know. Tasty treats are being sold outside the mosque, corn cobs, fried potato chips. The mosque has an air of a certain type of calm. There is a huge, old tree in the middle having some significance but as the writings were all in Turkish and no available literature, we did not get to know the tree personally. Highly Recommended for both the religious or the not so religious."

It was almost 800 years earlier when Ey\u00fcp Sultan died during the first siege of Constantinople in the 670s AD.Eyup Sultan Mosque, considered as the fourth most sacred mosque in the world after the mosques in Mecca, Medina and Jerusalem. Many tourists visit this site.Historically it has been Istanbul\u2019s holiest site and was at one time the traditional site for the coronation ceremony of Ottoman Sultans, where new sultans were girded with the sword of Osman (Uthman) one of the Prophet's companions and the third caliph of Islam."

As a tourist you can see the high regard Muslims have for Ayub Ansar (RA). He is one of the original companions of he Prophet Mohammed (SA) buried outside of Middle East. It is good to read up on the history of his life and how they grave was found. You might see some types of worship that are questionable but as a visitor you have to respect the practices. Highly recommend taking a cab to this site as there is no tram that goes this far. It's a bit of a hike, but a must see for all Muslims and history lovers. There is a bazaar in the area and they sell all types of Muslim religious things. It can get crowded, plan your day accordingly."

When Prophet Muhammad \ufdfa migrated to Medinah, he stayed at his house for few months. He had the honour of hosting Prophet \ufdfa and was a prominent Sahaba (companion) of the Holy Prophet \ufdfa . During the reign of Hazrat Muawiya he was part of the first expedition to Constantinople (although he was very old at that time). He felt ill during the course of the battle and left his will to the leader of Muslim army that he should be buried as close as possible to the walls of the city. The mosque and complex is the oldest in Istanbul. Sultan Mehmet Fatih ordered this after he conquered Constantinople and his sheikh (spritual leader) Ak Shamsuddin discovered the grave of Abu Eyup R.A. We planned to take ferry from Eminonu along the Golden Horn but when we reached Eminonu the last ferry had already left and the next one was in 50 mins time so we decided to catch bus 99A and it was quicker. Even before you have entered the actual mosque there is an amazing sense of tranquillity. The mosque architecture is impressive considering it was the first imperial mosque built by Ottomans. The tomb of Hazrat Abu Eyup is on one side from the main mosque. We went inside just before zuhur (mid day prayers) and paid our respect and salam to the great companion."

When the Prophet and his companions were expelled from Mecca and went to Madina many locals invited him to stay with them. So not to offend anyone the Prophet said that he would stay at the house where is camel would stop. The camel stopped at the house of Ayub Al Ansari. He showed great hospitality and insisted that who ever came to visit the prophet could not leave without taking food and drink. He was a brave warrior and was the first to volunteer when he was needed. On the campaign to defeat the Byzantine Empire by this time he was an old man He fell ill, It was his dying wish that he be buried under the walls of Constantinople. So this is very holy site for Muslims. The area is now known as Eyup Sultan. There is a lovely mosque and nice restaurants and some good souvenir shops also they are cheaper than the touristy parts."

We went on Eid and there were 1000s of Turks there and in the bazaars surrounding it. If you are in Istanbul, you have to visit this place, even if you are non muslim.The mosque was full of sufis at prayer time, and even though there were so many people, it was a very spiritual visit. You may see children all dressed in white which is their way of celebrating they have been circumcised.The fastest way to get there is to take the 99a bus from Eminonu. If you are not sure just asked the driver 'Sultan Eyup?' and you should get a response.If you are you, you have to go up to Pierre Loti which is on the other side of the complex. There is a 5 minutes cable care (telefrik) that gets you there....and it is high up. The views are amazing.Buy the IstanbulKart which will cover all your public transportation expenses and then some. One card can be used for many people. Just top it up and go.....its very cheap....taxis can be expensive.Enjoy!!"

Orhan Pamuk, the famous writer, wrote about this quarter as a little and a perfect village located at the end of the Golden Horn, that does not look realistic, but it always seems as semblance. HOW TO GET TO THE MOSQUEIf you take taxi drive from the Sultan Ahmet square /the Old Town/ or Taksim to Eyup quarter, it will cost about 30-40 TUR LIR or 10-12 EUR. Make a deal with a driver in advance. THE MOSQUE ITSELFThe ground plan is a rectangle. The dome sits on a cylinder which rests on eight semi-domes. The domed hall is surrounded by tree-sided balcony. The biggest attraction of the mosque represents the tiles that decorated the inner and outer walls of the mosque. They are the most beautiful examples of Iznik ceramics (16th-19th century). As an art lover, I could not take my eyes off these so beautiful tiles and I took many great photos of them. Next to the mosque, there is a fabulous fountain, that is one more spot for photo-stop. Only rule is: cover your hair /for women/ and cover your shoulders and knees /for everybody/ when you go in the mosque. RECOMMENDATIONThe beautiful decoration of the mosque deserves your attention and admiration. After visit of the mosque, take a walk along Eyup quarter's cobblestone that recalls some past centuries. You will feel as if you are taken to some other centuries and captured in the charm of old times. You will find both artistic beauty of the Eyup mosque and old charm of Eyup quarter. Warm recommendation!"

Eyup Sultan Mosque ,Sahaba Eba Eyyub Al Ansari- one of the companions of prophet Mohammed (peace be upon him ) has been the Islamic spirutal center of Istanbul for centuries. Eyyub Ansari joined to Arabic army to conquer Constantinople in 7th century AD but he was matryed in front of the city walls during the siege. When Constantinople was conquered by Mehmet II in 1453, the name was turned into Islambol-the city of the muslims- and Sultan's teacher called Aksemseddin found his tomb later. Sultan ordered to build a monumental shrine on the former toms place with a beautiful mosque. Ottoman sultans paid a great respect to Eyyub Ansari's shrine and most of them were crowned in Eyup Sultan. Visiting the shrine and praying in the mosque became a tradition not only by the Royal family and the inhabitants of Istanbul visited both places in religous festivals, pregnant ladies came here to have a healthy babies, young girls visited his shrine to find their future husbands, little boys were circunsized here and so on for thousands of years. Therefore the district was protected by the Ottoman government for a long time. On the other hand, both members of Ottoman dynasty & high officials and ordinary citizens wanted to be buried near Eyyup Sultan shrine as to be forgiven by Allah on behalf of prophet's companion. Therefore a big cemetery has been formed for centuries. Eyup discrict is a big open air cemetery museum containing with thousands of gravestones, shrines and tombs from 1453 to 1990. Ottoman history can be searched by looking at the beautiful written inscriptions in Eyup and it is a real \" open air gravestone museum \" today. The shrine and the mosque are always crowded and he makes a great contibution to the city's economy even today. It is a good example for \" sacred & holy tourism industry \" for Muslim world."

The Mosque and the district have the religious spirit and the oriental atmosphere. It\u2019s the 4th place in the world for Muslims after Mecca, Medina and Jerusalem. There is a tomb of Eyup el-Ensary there and the grounds considered sacred. He was the companion of the Prophet Mohammed. In the VIIth century Eyup died during the siege of Constantinople by Arabs. The mosque was built by 1458 by the order of Sultan Mehmed II Fatih after he had conquered Constantinople from the Byzantine Empire in 1453. Later on in the Middle Ages, Eyup Sultan Mosque became a very important point for all the sultans of the Ottoman Empire-they have passed there the procedure of the Osman Sword girding-a ritual a bit similar to the coronation of the European kings-after which the sultan received the full power. After all, it\u2019s simply another Istanbul! The charm of this outstanding spot has the long history and conserved well till our times. The ancient cemeteries surrounding the mosque add the Medieval air to this old and well established district. Numerous pilgrims and tourists come to this area, full of peace and beauty of the past. Moreover, you can also get to the famous and romantic Pierre Loti Caf\u00e9 on the top of the hill, close to the Eyup Sultan Mosque. The panorama of Istanbul which opens from there is just breathtaking! Recommended!!!"

They were filming a historic drama at the time so did not stay for long before going on to Pierre Loti Cafe. There was an elderly gentleman sitting outside the mosque with a small box of assorted perfume oils and he was perfuming the right hand of every person entering the mosque. (he did not accept any payment and was doing this as an act of devotion). I visited again in October 2014 just after the Eid and the place was full of pilgrims. I stayed for longer this time and enjoyed the definate 'spiritually special' atmosphere of this holy place. People were giving gifts to visitors as acts of charity and I was presented with a pair of socks by a young woman as I sat in the mosque courtyard which I accepted although I have yet to wear them! This tradition is observed usually when a person has had a prayer answered or it is done in memory of a loved one.Eyup Sultan Mosque now certainly occupies a special place in my heart and I just have to recollect my visit to again experience the calm serenity of the place despite it being very busy. The old man with the perfume was not there this time and I missed him, perhaps he will be there the next time I visit."

We arrived just after a thunderstorm and the place was alive with locals going about their worship, there was a bride arriving for her wedding and little boys done up in their white suits in preparation for the circumcision ceremonies; it was the only insight we had of a functioning mosque rather than a museum during our whole 3 days and a lot of visits to \u2018museum mosques\u2019. The service was over and the Imam was talking to his flock and there was absolutely no problem with us going in and we were even encouraged to take photographs \u2013 you got a real sense of Muslims being proud of their heritage and yet being respectful of yours and being welcoming towards you \u2013 a shame that is not able to be present in the larger and more touristic places. The inside is gorgeous, that almost goes without saying. The extensive graveyards are enthralling and, just like ours here in the West, some are severely neglected and overgrown. There is the tomb of one of the Prophet\u2019s (Peace be on him) nearest military collaborators and everything is set in a working space for the inhabitants of this part of the city with fountains (we saw, relatively, so few during or visit), eateries, shops and everything the population needs for its everyday life and all with the mosque at its centre serving the community.

Hazrat Ayub was killed here during the first Muslim siege at Constantinople. We came here by bus 99 from the Eminonu Bus Station as we had just missed the ferry and didn't want to wait another hour. It was about 5pm and it was the rush hour. On the way we saw the the old City Walls and other areas. After getting off the bus, there is a square and a little ahead is the mosque and the mausoleum. Maybe for other tourists its not a great attraction but for the Muslims it holds a lot of sanctity. Many a prayers are heard and accepted here. Its very peaceful There is a graveyard too. Some souvenir shops are along the way. We bought some small silver trays with a tomb like cover for 5TL. The Muslims must visit the Mausoleum."

After visiting the shrine , praying for deceased and doing Salah in the Masjid you can look around in the bazaar area(or do this before the shrine) , but if you are pressed for time or not there for religious reasons get in the queue for the cable car which costs about 2 TL on your Istanbulcart..the views during the ascent are amazing .

You can reach it by car, bus or my favorite way by Ferry.Visit the Mosque and please, dress appropriately, it is a Holly Site. No shorts, no short sleeves, and a scarf to cover your head. You might follow my advice, being a Turk, living in the USA and taking along a lot of friends to see Istanbul, I advise them to put a T-shirt and carry ALL THE TIME, in their bags, a light weight long sleeve cardigan and a scarf. This way you are always ready to visit a mosque if you so wish, and there are so many! And please, NO shorts.Then visit the tomb of the Saint, he is known to accomplish all your prayers and wishes. He was the Banner Bearer of our Prophet Muhammed (pbuh).Then go to the market. Best place to buy Rose Oil or Jasmine Oil. And beautiful Head Scarves with OYA (hand made by crochet of flowers or other lovely decorations). I always buy dozens and bring it back to the US as gifts and everyone loves them. They go for about $ 5 each and you get a baker's discount for buying many!DO eat the ice cream there, it is scrumptious, especially the KAYMAK (Turkish Speciality made with milk, sugar and Pine Tree gum) and the VISNE (Sour Cherry) even better than Italian Gelatos!From there proceed to the Funicular and go to Pierre Loti Cafe. Or if you have good legs walk the path up. You will see amazing old tombs and lovely vistas. There is also a beautiful Nakshbandhi Tekke (Sufi Monastery of the Naksbandhi Order), a must stop and see site. The Gate Keeper Dervish will be happy to answer all your questions.You will eventually reach the little cafe, this was the favorite place of the French Writer who wrote a lot of books on Istanbul. Once there you will understand why, the view of the Golden Horn is amazing. Don't forget your camera!Above, short walk from the Anatole France Cafe, there is a great restaurant with excellent food and view.Don't forget to stop and pray at the tomb of a Sufi Saint just before the entrance of the Restaurant.There you can also enjoy a Narguile (Turkish Water Pipe), don't leave Istanbul without trying at least one!!!"

The mosque and surrounding areas were packed with praying muslims, many obviously travellers on some kind of pilgrimage. Tents were set up in the nearby squares with Imams giving sermons, and the park benches were filled with old men chatting and playing cards. The tomb/viewing area of Eyup El Ensari was open, filled with the devout praying, so we got just a short view before moving on. The mosque itself was also packed with more praying muslims, and there were only a small handful of discreet tourists like us lurking about. We stayed in the back as there was a call to prayer going on, with the singer in the raised seat next to one of the columns speaking into a microphone. It was a great chance to see real muslim worshippers in action, not just the tourist-packed throngs of the more famous mosques. The men were in the bottom center area, the women were confined to the sides and the upper gallery. The only downside was that the mosque was so packed, even next to the door the smell of shoeless feet was overpowering. Like bigger mosques, they have clothes and scarves to help you cover up before going in. You can walk through an Islamic cemetery or take a cable car up the hill to the Pierre Loti Cafe for the view at a public viewing station, but actually patronizing the touristy and overpriced cafe is optional."

The Mosque and Mausoleum of Ey\u00fcp Sultan, located outside the corner where the land walls meet the walls along the Golden Horn, is considered a sacred site for Moslems. Ey\u00fcp-el-Ensari was a standard-bearer of Mohammed and he died-here during an Arabic siege of the city in the 7th century. His grave was discovered at the conquest and later the mausoleum and the first mosque in Istanbul were built on this site. The original mosque was destroyed in an earthquake and the present one was constructed in its place in 1800. On Fridays, holy days for Islam, throngs of the faithful visit the mausoleum. The old trees, flocks of pigeons, the praying believers and the visiting crowds create a mystical and colorful atmosphere around the mosque and the mausoleum. The walls of the mausoleum in the courtyard are covered with tiles from different periods. Historical sources indicate that in Byzantine times this district was also a holy site where people came to visit the grave of a saint and to pray for rain during times of drought. The sultans succeeding Mehmet the Conqueror completed their coronation and sword-bearing ceremonies with a visit to the Eyup Sultan Mausoleum. The vicinity of the mosque and the neighboring hills are occupied by cemeteries. The famous Pierre Loti Cafe is also in this district. The well-known poet and author Loti was enraptured by Istanbul and he came here often to watch the beauties of the Golden Horn of those days. The view from this small cafe and the terrace, particularly during full moon, leaves long-lasting impressions on the visitors."

The place is very peaceful, full of birds and pigeons, you may wish to feed (pigeon food 1TL for a cup of corn or rice I guess). Muslim tourists may have a chance to pray inside the mosque and make a duaa for the prophet's companion Abu Ayub Al Ansari. Our visit was without a guide, we really missed lots of information about tombs and other parts of the place. We tried to ask locals but none of them were able to answer even those who speaks english.You can see locals bringing their kids who recently underwent circumcision, wearing very pleasant and traditional ottoman cloths. Good chance to have some nice shots of them or with them, people are very happy their and always welcoming to help.There are outer spaces with lots of fountains, that did not start until around 12 noon. So keep that in mind if you wish to have a good shot. I recommend to visit this place anytime of the week except on fridays because of the friday prayer and the place will be full, even the outer space of the mosque, no place for any tourist to visit.The place is full of souvenir shops, scarfs, antiques, food, and sweets. Mado is the best for sweets, located on the main streets on the main way to the mosque. I recommend you buy sahlep, some kind of sweets, very tasty full of cinnamon flavor and good during cold time. For narjila fans, who would like to smoke, you may find some restaurants offering it close to Mado. It is a very nice place to spend a couple of hours there.Keep in mind, no rest rooms in the restaurants, there is a public WC, it is ok, not bad, you should pay 1TL to get in. Merchants there are hardly negotiable, but do not give up, keep pushing them for discount, so you even end up kicked out of the shop or win the bargain."

The mosque itself is in a green, hilly area outside the serious traffic of the city so the neighborhood is worth a trip in itself. The mosque is both gorgeous and holy; plus, even though it is still a working mosque, it is welcoming to respectful visitors. The adjoining cemetery is a must-see as well. Walk up and have a coffee at the top. It's a good hike, but there is also a cable car up. You could have lunch up there or down below in the mosque neighborhood, which has excellent restaurants\u2014we are at Sadabat Kebap and enjoyed the usual amazing Turkish food.

Just outside, is a lovely marble square with places to sit, eat and drink, and it has a very traditional feel to it. The interior is plain and lacks outstanding sights, but has a feeling of calm and spirituality difficult to find in the bigger mosques frequented by tourists.

The day we travelled there it appeared to be a local festival or day of religious importance. It was very busy with local people and a service was taking place when we were there. We were therefore unable to enter the Mosque and withdrew so that we did not disturb the celebrations. The exterior is in keeping with other Mosques. Eyup is a district different from the historical centre of the city. It has a 'holiday' feeling about it and the area is obviously by the inhabitants of Istanbul. It is well worth the (very cheap) ferry trip which we paid for using our Istanbulcard."

But the Sultan Mehmet (the conqurer of the Istanbul) saw the place of tomb in his dreams twice and ordered an mosque and tomb to be built at the place he saw in his dream, in the name of Eyup Sultan.

            "review": "Top tips for visiting Eyup Sultan Mosque (Eyup Sultan Camii). Why is this town not listed as a must-visit place in Istanbul? Although the Eyup mosque is highly reccommended place to visit but nobody ever reviewed about the town on tripadvisor.There are so much more Eyup can offer than just visiting the mosque. This town probably has not been explored much by the tourists except the cemetery part, Pierre Loti cafe and the mosque. We accidentally chanced upon this town just a few kilometres away from Sultanahmet and Taksim square. I am going to give you a few good insights and tips about visiting the town as well as the mosque. Tip 1: how to get there? Take a local bus number 99 from Eminonu. It cost 2 - 3 Tl (lira) per person. The ride is about 20 minutes and make sure you stop a few stops after you past the second bridge. You will need to gauge it yourself unless you have a smart phone. Don't bother taking the ferry, taking a bus is so much easier and faster. Tip 2: if you want to see the mosque, get there in the morning because the crowd seems build up in the afternoon. We went there on a sunday. Tip 3: there are also a lot of old sultans' tombs along the way to the mosque and you are allowed to enter for free but make sure you take off your shoes to enter the shrine. Tip 4: start the cemetery walking trail near the mosque where shops were selling muslim robes and holy books. Tip 5: Since this is a place that attracts pilgrimage, there is of course a shopping street too. Do not miss out on the famous savoury pastry, Turkish Borek, that is sold in the shops (See picture). Out of so many Borek shops, we chanced upon this quaint little small borek shop which sells Borek for 1.25 TL per 100 gram if i am not wrong. You cannot miss it! Tip 6: while we were walking around the cemetery area, we also found out there is a huge local market at the hilly side of the town. It is very difficult to find but if you found it, you will not regret it. You can see the everyday life of the locals here especialy the hustles and bustles. If i could give you an exact location, then it would be near the Pierre Loti cafe. See picture. Also you can find the cheapest kebab here for only 2 Tl to 4 Tl. Tip 7: you can forget about going to the Pierre Loti cafe because if you did the cemetery walking trail, you can literally see the Golden Horn from the cemetery. Tip 8: just so you know, the traffic from Eyup to town (sultanahmet or taksim) will be quite bad because the turkish seemed to come out after 3pm during the day. make sure you plan your time ahead if you are heading to the airport.

If you did not see any mosques or did not have enough of seeing mosques in Turkey, then go and spend sometime by the Eyup Sultan Mosque and its surrounding area. There is a major cemetry and nice little shops and restaurants by the mosque. It is the most important mosque for turkish people because the name Eyup is one of the companion of the prophet Mohamed his name is Abu Eyup Al-Ansari who they believed lived and died in Istanbul. The mosque gets over crowded on Fridays and around major Islamic Holidays and the area can get very crowded.There is a Slauter House for sheeps and cows near by that can make the area smells bad, although it is covered and somewhat clean."

            "review": "Excellent if you want more than a superficial look at tourist sites. The Eyup Sultan Camii is considered by Muslims to be the most holy place in Istanbul. It is the site of the tomb of one of the companions of the Prophet Muhammad. This mosque is worth a visit for those who want to see more of \"real\" life in Istanbul than just Sultanahmet Square. Because of the tomb, it is a site of pilgrimage for Muslims, and you will find both Istanbullus and people from other areas going to pay their respects. Within the mosque itself you can respectfully sit at the back (women upstairs) while people pray. The mosque has one of the largest women's sections of any mosque in Istanbul, with overflow areas when the crowds are too big for the balcony above the main section of the mosque, so for women it is easier to find an \"out of the way\" place to observe than at most other mosques. Because families come to the mosque together, there are usually mothers with young children in the women's area, and as a result, it's an interesting place to see how families manage their religious observance with their kids.The tomb is located across the courtyard from the main entrance to the indoor section of the mosque. When it is not under renovation, the tomb is open for visitors, and there are generally a lot of people inside praying. The veneration of Eyup Sultan is not technically orthodox in Islam, and as a result the sharp observer can see some of the differences between orthodoxy and \"folk\" or \"popular\" practices in Islam. Every religion has these, but they are often hidden to outside observers. This mosque is a good place to go to see the juxtaposition of orthodox and popular Islam.The mosque can generally be reached by bus or by ferry. The Eyup ferry terminal has been closed for repairs, and it's not clear how long these will take, so at this time the bus is the best option. It's worth checking the schedule, though, to see when the ferry terminal opens again, because the ride up the Golden Horn from the Eminonu terminal (just past the bus terminal and labeled Hal\u0131\u00e7) is very pleasant and inexpensive.Note that the mosque and tomb are likely to be packed during Ramadan."

Just lovely and interesting. Strangely, it was one of one of the favorite things we saw.We appreciated the Eyup mosque and the area around it, quite different from what you feel in Sultanahmet. There were fewer tourists in this area. the fountain and square outside of the mosque was filled with families and little boys dressed in prince outfits preparing to celebrate their circumcisions."

Great restaurants all around the area. Well worth the visit."

This Mosque, farther away from the tourist part of the city, was the most real experience we had in all the Islamic holy sites in Istanbul. Because it is less touristy and predominantly attended by more orthodox Muslims (apparently), we experienced the Islamic faith in a different way from that experienced in the mosques of the Sultanahmet area (for example). As if it was not enough, this gorgeous sanctuary has beautiful colors in shades of blue and a light incidental music making a very unique atmosphere of the place (despite the crowd of local religious that go there to pray and visit the Eyup Sultan\u00b4s mausoleum)."

I would definitely recommend a visit, however it may not be much different to a normal mosque for a non muslim.We hopped off here while touring Istanbul as the tour bus stops a few mins walk from the mosque and hopped back on after 3 hours which gave us enough time to pray and look around."

A visit to the Eyup Mosque is an amazing experience and you will really discover the spirit of the people of Istanbul as there is very few tourist. The Mosque and its courtyard is beautiful and there is a special section where you can walk through and offer prayers or just experience the peacefull atmosphere.When you visit the mosque consider a visit to the Pierre Loti cafe which can be reached by cable car and you will get a wonderful view of the Golden Horn with your cup of tea. Afterwards you can meander down the hill through the old cemetery to the mosque. The best way to get there is to take the ferry from the Galata Bridge to the Eyup stop . The ferry departs from the left hand side of the bridge as you stood facing the Galata Tower. This is really a lovely day outing to discover a different part of Istanbul."

This mosque, situated in a district called Ey\u00fcp which is almost an ancient and holy necropolis of Ottoman times, is considered the number 4 shrine of Islamic communities after Mecca, Medina and Jerusalem. Built in 1458, just 5 years after the conquest of Istanbul by the Ottomans, it also supposedly hosts the tomb of Ebu Eyyub Halid bin Zeyd el Ensari (one of the first supporters of Prophet Mohammad) who had joined Ummayads when they tried to conquest Constantinople in 7th century and this is what makes it that holy in religious meaning. Of course, the mosque itself has been renovated many times since its establishment but its simplicity has been preserved throughout the years. It's usually a very crowded area and especiallt last Sunday of every month, a very ancient Quoran is displayed here and those days, it's almost impossible to move around let along walk around. So it's better not to go there those Sundays."

I admit I was a complete tourist in Istanbul, but I'm always interested in getting away from touristy places to experience places and opportunities that are more a real part of any city that I visit. The Eyup Sultan Mosque is probably the most holy mosque in Turkey, and it is built right next to the memorial tomb of Eyup Sultan, with a small courtyard in the middle. This is definitely not a tourist place, or perhaps to be more precise, it isn't much of a tourist site for non-Muslim tourists. It is filled with people who are in contemplative prayer (male and female), and clearly it is a destination point for Muslims from many different cultures and countries. There are scarves available for women visitors, and plastic bags to carry shoes. The interior of the mosque is quite beautiful with a number of lovely windows looking into a very very old graveyard (with the most unique and interesting tombstones I have ever seen). Between the mosque and the highly-decorated tomb of Eyup Sultan is a lovely courtyard with a HUGE old tree that is hundreds of years old (the top has been lopped off but it is still very much alive, and very impressive). The tomb is very decorated, with beautiful tiles. It is small and packed with visitors. The actual burial memorial is roped off and in its own separate viewing room (it is very ornate and quite a sight to see). There were a number of women who were showing respect, and it felt wrong to jostle to the front to see better. In the back of the room, there is a small space that is roped off, with a line. In the wall is a case with a piece of marble. The marble is where Mohamed stepped at one time, and it's called the footprint of Mohamed, and it's quite popular to see. I really felt the power of this holy place, although I am not Muslim. I thought it was well worth a visit, and for tourists who want to see something that isn't really touristy, it was a pretty great destination. It was interesting and historic, and it was clearly a very important place for Muslims from all over the world. If you have free time, and the inclination to get off the tourist path, then I highly recommend going to see the Eyup Sultan Mosque."

This is the resting place of abu ayyub al ansari (R), a very famous companion of the beloved prophet Muhammed (PBUH). The tomb can be very bust but wont take more than 15/20mins to get in - I dont recomend visitng it during Friday prayers. In the tomb is also a footprint of the Prophet Muhammed and alongside is the Eyup mosque.Outside of the Eyup Mosque are some bazaars which most of the locals use which i found alot cheaper and alot less stressful then the traditional Spice & Grand Bazaars. The bazaar immediately next to the mosque sells Islamic items such as scarfs, qurans, pictures and other Islamic items.Once you finish here i do recommend jumping onto the Cable Car to Pierre Lotti Cafe which has some amazing views of Istanbul for some refreshments. Its so easy and is all sign posted from Eyup Mosque and costs 2TL - from the Cable Car you also get a view of the ancient graveyard on the hill side."

As such he is a legendary figure in early Islam and was part of the first Muslim legions sent to conquer Constantinople. When he was dying, he asked that his friends but his body on a horse and attack as far as they could and bury him deep within enemy territory. This they did and centuries later, the army of Mehmet Faith (the conqueror of Constantinople) found his grave and built the mausoleum and mosque at the site.Rich with history and charm Eyup Sultan was the location where the Sultan and Caliph were given the sword of Othman confirming them as ruler and the most holy place in all of Turkey."
