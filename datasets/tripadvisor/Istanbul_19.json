The museum has an amazing collection and is laid out in a way that one can see everything, or choose to skip areas of low interest. We went on a rainy day and it was the best way to spend time indoors. Came out with a renewed appreciation of the past civilizations of the region. Well worth spending a few hours."

This museum is filled with fantastic relics from Turkish and middle eastern civilizations of the past. It is staggering the size and quality of these remains. But having said that, I don't feel like I walked away having learned something, despite having spent at least two hours there. If you are short on time, I would stick to exploring the city and taking your dose history from the nearby Topkappi palace. The museum is located in the same complex that houses the Topkappi palace. It is housed in buildings that were once a part of this palace. When I visited it was under construction, but there were four buildings/sections open, with a courtyard in between the first and the last three. The first building/section contained the relics from early civilizations in turkey and the middle east, including the usual pots and trinkets and even some partially rebuilt temples. The courtyard houses the second building, which is a small tiled house displaying some porcelain work through the ages from Bursa and Iznik. The building itself is also decorated in tiles. The courtyard has some additional (unmarked) statues and when the construction has finished, I am sure will be quite striking in itself. The next section is very easy to miss and after following a long taped off tunnel of tarp can be found to contain old marble sarcophigai. The fourth section can be found by once again entering the courtyard and entering another almost hidden entrance. This housed the history of the city itself. This was the most historically interesting part but it was so expansive and it was hard to follow its multi-floored, nook-filled layout. It also didn't seem to be 100% chronological, which made it a bit confusing. If I were to do it all again I would have only visited the first building, the courtyard, and the tile house. Maybe after construction the final two buildings will be more clearly marked and better organized."

It is well worth a full day of your time especially if you read the plaques describing the various areas and objects. They have a display of artifacts from the Lower Paleolithic Period (1 millions years ago); the 9 Troy settlements (earliest was about 3,000 BC); some villages currently underwater by the Black Sea shoreline; beautiful, intricately carved sarcophagus'; intact statutes from the Roman period, an extensive Egyptian collection, and artifacts from the Ottoman Empire area, Arabian Peninsula, the Balkans, Africa, and Mesopotamia. In fact there were more intact statutes of the Greek gods here than in Athens - probably due to the statutes in Athens being desecrated by the early Christians/other conquering armies. The descriptions of Homer's Odyssey and Troy were particular interesting to me. May be the best museum that I ever visited. Far better than the New York Museum. Makes me want to plan a visit to the London Museum.Another plus is that it is part of the Museum Pass - the best bargain in Istanbul."

Even the grounds surrounding the Archaeological Museums are packed with classical history \u2013 tombs, columns and other assorted, durable artifacts from diverse ancient Greek and Roman sites in both European and Asian Turkey were arrayed in the open air. As was the case with many of Istanbul\u2019s monuments and public buildings, much of the museum complex was under restoration. Not being terribly interested in weapons or crockery, we focused on two sections, going first to the Tile Pavilion. It was even better than I had anticipated \u2013 and I had had high expectations for it. The colonnaded structure was devoted to tiles and ceramics, each piece displayed distinctly and lit so that its features could be duly appreciated. Texts in Turkish and English explained the origin of each piece and its place as an exemplar of the development of Turkey\u2019s ceramic art. We learned how and when various colors \u2013 notably the rich red, green and turquoise \u2013 had been added to the original blue and white Iznik glazes and how wax and multiple firings had been used to keep these later, more varied colors from bleeding into each other.The second building we explored was the famous section of Greek, Roman and Byzantine sarcophagi and other funerary items, most of them white marble. Some of these exhibited exquisite, artfully realistic carvings depicting highlights from the life of the deceased or scenes of an idyllic afterlife. Equally interesting, though less showy, were marble plaques explaining who had commissioned a given tomb."

Having spent numerous days in Smithsonian museums, many of which are interactive and visually trendy, my trip to three of the museums at this site were rather boring. They reminded me of old 1960's museums of my elementary days. Looking through windows at dozens of similar pottery jugs, similar knives, similar earrings, similar statuettes, etc, with brief tags labeling the date, did not make for a vibrant experience. Most of what we saw, including the classical statues, we'd seen elsewhere, and with much better presentation.Our tour of a photography exhibit ( about to close down) was more baffling than enlightening. The theme was people living on a border. Unfortunately, without any captions or explanations, all we had were the photos of forlorn looking people at their jobs or at rest, with no explanation about them or their situation. We also didn't know their location. What borders were they on? Perhaps the purpose was existentialist, but the meaning was lost on us. Once back at our hotel, our concierge told us the Ancient Oriental Museum was the best one. Unfortunately, we didn't get to that one.This collection of museums isn't a site I'd return to if in town again."

We enjoyed the museum very much; it's quite large and has a lot to offer (which is stating the obvious given the extremely long and rich history of the area), so reserve 4+ hours if you want to see everything (and you'll need a few breaks here and there).One criticism: the museum is very old fashioned, meaning that it has none of the more interactive / immersive features of more modern museums, with presentations, movies, etc. It's very much in the old style where you walk from one room to the other and admire the items exhibited and read the explanations (Turkish / English, with the English version rather crude and broken occasionally, which was quite surprising). In addition, I did not see the typical \"map\" of the museum at the entrance, which normally describes how the museum is organized, what is where, etc. So we had to walk one building after the other, one room after the other and were occasionally puzzled by the jumps back and forth in time / region.Still, absolutely well worth seeing. And it was not crowded at all (in March)."

I like that each item has enough description to give you an idea where it came from and whether it is original or a copy. Many other museums don't even mention of the statue is a copy.You will need around 2-3 hours to tour this museum to see most displayed items. Next door to it is the ceramic museum. You can access this museum from outside of the Topkapi palace, just go to the right of the carpet museum and keep walking a couple of minutes to get to the Archaeological museum. Also, you can reach it from Golhan park.Also, I recommend you buy the 3 day museums pass for 80TL. It covers this and many other museums. Saves you a lot of money and waiting due lines."

You will find here pieces of Constantinople / Istanbul that are not visible outside the museum, but were very important in the city's history. For example, you can find here artifacts of the Holy Apostles Church which once was one of the most important churches in this important town for churches.

The Archaeological Museums are really three museums, the Museum of the Ancient Orient, the Archeology Museum proper, and the Ceramics Museum. I liked the first and third a great deal, but I had trouble with the second, largely because it was under renovation. The Museum of the Ancient Orient features artifacts from ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia. If you have seen really strong collections, like the ones in Berlin, this one won't impress you too much, particularly if you are stranger to the subject, like I am, and need good signage to appreciate this sort of thing. The signage is not very informative at all. The Archeology Museum, with its Roman statuary and Byzantine artifacts, was more my cup of tea, but it was under renovation, making everything hard to appreciate. The Ceramics Museum was small and lovely. The three museums are clustered around a little square with a lovely caf\u00e9. They can be reached either by coming down from the Topkapi Palace (clear signage marks the way), or by entering the gate near the Gulhane tramway stop."

This colorful mix can be seen here and is brought in an order such that visitors can understand the historic context and visit artifacts from Roman and Islamic cultures/times.The museum is rather old in the way collections are presented. It lacks some visual aids such as computer animated maps with historic contexts, videos to watch while taking a break, or other visual guidance that helps putting everything into context.But otherwise its a great collection to visit.

I am sure that had it not been largely closed for renovation (and with many of the headline exhibits unavailable for viewing) I would have given it a higher rating.This is another place which falls under the Istanbul Museum pass (recommended for those visiting multiple museums).There are in fact three museums in this complex. The archaeological museum, Ancient Orient Museum and the Tiled Kiosk Museum. The main archaeological museum was largely under renovation but still had a part open which included some wonderful artefacts.The Ancient Orient Museum however really got the historical juices flowing. Here we found extraordinary artefacts from hundreds to thousands of years BC. The entrance is close to a tram stop and can also be accessed from the Topkapi palace.Thoroughly recommended for anyone with an interest in ancient history."

There are no printed brochures, so it is very difficult to know where to find things at the Archeological Museum. There are (at least) three buildings in the same complex: the huge main building, the Ancient Orient building, and the Tiled Kiosk. To me, the best things were located in the smallish Ancient Orient building, which would be easy to overlook. This building contained incredible finds from ancient Sumer, Babylon, etc-- including many huge tile murals of animals from the Ishtar Gate. These are amazing, along with other things from the same collection. So don't miss the small Ancient Orient building. The Tile Kiosk is small and has some lovely things, too-- can be seen in a few minutes. The main building was just a mess, and much of what was on display was a seemingly endless collection of Greek and Roman sarcophagi and grave steles. I love Classical art, but this collection got monotonous in a hurry. This building also had an Istanbul thru the ages exhibition. The artifacts in it were generally uninteresting, and the information isn't that much more than a good intro chapter on the history of the city in a good guidebook."

Some of the most spectacular displays are the glazed bricks from the Ishtar Gate of Babylon depicting in bas-relief a series of aurochs (a wild ox now extinct), dragons (the sirrush, sacred to Marduk), and lions (sacred to Ishtar). It is the most complete collection of such creatures outside the Pergamon Museum in Berlin. The so-called Alexander Sarcophagus is even more significant but, unfortunately, is not on display. Indeed, most of the Archaeological Museum is closed for retrofitting and restoration, although one still can see a head from the Serpent Column in the Hippodrome and a fragment of the porphyry statue of the Tetrarchs in Venice. The closure of most of the halls will nevertheless be a disappointment to someone visiting for the first time."

We had a Muzekart and luckily we didn't waste money on the entrance fee. It was a waste of time walking up the steep hill pushing a stroller along a cobbled road to reach the entrance; and a waste of 15lira on the audio guide.Most of the museum is closed for renovations. We couldn't find out way to most of the items highlighted in the museum audio guide. We visited in October 2015. I would rather enquire as to when the extensive renovations will be completed before venturing anywhere close to this museum!"

They are renovating the buildings but the archaeological finds are amazing! The oldest multiplication table, and the oldest love poem carved onto cuneiform tablets thousands of years ago amazed. The lions and mythical creatures with snake tails that lined the road to Babylon are still vividly colored. Sumerian and Hittite statues and altars, beautifully carved Syrian tombs(even one skeleton) and the Egyptian mummy, will interest teenagers as well! The Sultan's Tiled Pavilion is beautiful, the geometric Arabic letters are interesting. The rare yellow and green tiles as well as the recessed, ornate fountain featured in Osman Hamdi Bey's painting are gorgeous.  There is a cafe serving pastries and few hot selections in the shaded courtyard. Prices are much more reasonable than at Topkapi Palace and service is friendly-do watch out for the aggressive kitties that will climb on the table and swipe your food. The pistachio cake and the generously sized latte were delicious!  There are no lines here, even on days when Topkapi Palace has dozens waiting to buy tickets. The 85TL five day Museum Card is sold here and at nearby Hagia Irene if you want to avoid the long lines at Topkapi or Hagia Sophia. HANDICAPPED VISITORS, there is a golf cart that will take you from the bottom of the hill next to the Gulhane Stop up to the Archaeological Museum and then further up to Topkapi Palace. Unfortunately there is only one golf cart, it doesn't seem to be running on a set schedule, and doesn't run during lunch hour.  During tulip season, walk down from Gulhane Station to the restaurant that has a beautiful terrace hanging over Gulhane Park."

It is a pity that many halls are closed for restoration. Lack of information ( exit signs, WC etc). Some artifacts are poorly fixed and are in danger of being damaged ( for example I witnessed how close to tourists passing buy us located a gravestone ( display number 87.80) which has a crack in the foundation and is shaking when tourists are passing by. The 2nd floor has no seating area at all, I was glad a security offered me a chair to rest where I witnessed her answering the same question of tourists ( which way is the exit? Which way are the toilets?) over 50 times in 15 minutes. The museum management should definitely invest in posting the signs for guests' convenience."

Here is a summary of our review:PROS:\u2022 Mesopotamia Collection & Roman Era Artifacts. Although we had already visited other museums throughout Western Turkey, we did see unique collections here that we had not previously seen. We favored the Ancient Orient Museum exhibits, especially the Mesopotamia Collection. In the New Building of the Archaeology Museum, we were in awe of the Roman statues and artifacts of that era, especially the museum's displays of some of the very large intricately sculpted sarcophagi .CONS:\u2022 Under Renovation. Unfortunately, the museum is under renovation so portions of the Old and New Archaeological Museums are closed. And it appeared it was a considerable amount under renovation. After visiting the Ankara Ancient Civilizations Museum, Antalya Museum and Istanbul Turkish & Islamic Arts Museum, we were disappointed what small amount of collections that were on display. The Museum is actually divided into four buildings which seems a bit disjointed and can be confusing if you do not have a map and understand this in advance. Not sure if this is because of the renovations? \u2022 Don't buy the audio tour! We paid the same price for the audio tour as our admission ticket. We were so disappointed! Although it was in English, there were very few exhibits that offered audio. And if it did, the audio messages were usually very short, repetitive with the displayed signage and offered no opportunities for further in depth audio information."

The first two are pleasant enough but the main building is currently a bit of a let down. Istanbul has such an amazing history through the millennia but the museum just doesn't manage to capture any of the excitement of the amazing history of the city.Perhaps I am being unfair and once the renovations are complete this might be a great place to visit but at the moment it is just a bit boring.

Unlike other venues in Istanbul there were no queues and it was a pleasure to be able to view the exhibits in one's own time. Unfortunately, the comprehensive museum guide included in the ticket price had run out (the English version)Two of the buildings have several steps but there is a ramp to enter the Sarcophagus.Be sure to view the Karaman Mihrab (beautifully tiled), the Alexander Sarcophagus and the Treaty of Kadesh tablet which is the world's earliest surviving peace treaty.Archaeological finds dot the shded, restful grounds and there is a lovely outdoor cafe as well.Due to time restrictions we spent about 2 hours here but to do justice to the museum about 4 hours is recommended."

Compared to the Museum of Anatolian Civilizations in Ankara, which we visited a week earlier, the Istanbul Archaeological Museum palls by comparison. Perhaps this is because a good two-thirds of the galleries are closed for renovation, which isn't expected to be completed until the end of 2019. The museum's collection of antique tiles, in no way compares to what we saw in Topkapi. The Archaeological Museum of Istanbul has the potential of becoming one of the world's best places to view sculpture from Classical Greece and Rome, but because so many of the galleries are closed, I'd wait several years before going back. I'm sure the renovation, which is quite extensive, will provide the museum with a good deal more exhibit space. As things now stand, many of the galleries are closed and not that well curated.. ."

The content is mainly house in three buildings. The collection has some absolutely amazing things, statues and mosaics, seals and tools, a section of graves and sarcophagai (or -guses or however you pluralize that one) seals and tablets. Some of which date back to the beginnings of recorded history. If you like archaeology, this is definitely worth checking out.

The museum is located below the Topkapi Palace and above the Alemdar Cad. So you have a climb up or down...happily they provide a free 'golf cart' ride in both directions. While we were there it was in the high 80 degrees F and the driver took us up and to the exit of the Topkapi Palace exit.

Many antiquities and several floors to view in several buildings. We could have stayed longer. There is a little cafe on the grounds and we had lunch there.

Having read a few of the reviews on here, I was a little apprehensive: would everything be closed, would the English-language signs be of poor quality, etc. having now visited, I can say that these negative reviews are absolute rubbish. This is easily one of the best museums I have ever been to (on a par with the British Museum, for example), with so many amazing things that they have ancient monuments strewn in the gardens around the caf\u00e9 and the palace more generally. When other reviewers have mentioned contradictory information next to the exhibits, I can only assume they must be referring to the section on the various contradictory myths about the city's founding. I assume it will be clear to most why the information here will be contradictory in nature.The ancient orient building was brilliant - my favourite bits were the actual friezes from the gates of ancient Babylon, but there was loads more here including an actual Hamurabai Code!The next building concerned Anatolia through the ages, in which we learned about the evolution of the representation of emotion and of specific individuals in sculpture, as well as seeing a fragment of Constantine the Great's tomb and the chain put across the Golden Horn to stop the Ottomans in 1453 (oops).Building #3 was all about tiles, and was equally brilliant.Finally, hidden behind signs (and smells) for the toilets, we found another building full of ancient sarcophagae (?) and a couple of reconstructed temples. This really was indicative of the whole museum: so understated, and yet full of amazing things.Brilliant!"

The city of Istanbul was critical to the speed of Christianity (Constantine) and Islam (the Ottomans).With this history, you would expect the archeology museum to have great artifacts and they do. But equally impressive is the organization and presentation of their incredible collection. My wife and I spent 4 hours going through four buildings (with a stop for iced coffee in the lovely garden restaurant) and enjoyed all parts of the museum. The exhibition goes back 400,000 years with artifacts from hominid settlers (well before modern humans left Africa) and has an extensive collection of materials from early civilizations including the Babylonians, Assyrians, Greeks, Romans, etc. While not as slick as the Archeology Museum in Mexico City, this was one of the nicest archeology museums I have ever seen.

TILED KIOSK MUSEUM (Museum of Islamic Art): (\u00c7inili K\u00f6\u015fk M\u00fczesi): About 2000 artifacts belonging to Seljuk, Anatolian and Ottoman tiles and ceramics dating from the end of the 12th century to the beginning of the 20th century.ANCIENT ORIENT MUSEUM: (Eski \u015eark Eserleri M\u00fczesi): This 1883 building consists of the sections of Pre-Islamic Arabian Art, Egypt Collection, Mesopotamia Collection, Anatolia Collection, Urartu Collection and Cuneiform Documents.Together, this is a huge museum! So huge that its difficult to go through it in one go but as it has a combined ticket thus you are obliged to do so. Although I like history and museums but there was a lot of non-interesting stuff present there. I mean unless you are a history student, you might skip through 60% of the artifacts on display there. What I liked was TILED KIOSK MUSEUM but that was also because I had not visited any Ottoman building by then, after visiting various mosques, I felt there was no need to visit TILED KIOSK MUSEUM.

The descriptions in English are written in bullet points, which are very difficult to follow.In June it was also under construction. There center piece (Alexander sarcophagus; a sarcophagus with engravings of Alexander) was not on display.disappointing. so spare the time an go to Topkapi palace; it gives you more insights (although it is also a bit 'coloured' in its descriptions)"

My favourite pieces included the first ever peace treaty (the treaty of Kadesh) on a clay tablet signed between the Egyptian pharaoh Ramises II and the Hittite king in 1283 BC that ended a conflict between these two great ancient empires. Also a lion sculpture taken from the Mausoleum of Halicarnassus which was one of the 7 ancient wonders of the world. Generally first class exhibits throughout which you could spend hours viewing. I went in the morning and it was not busy at all but towards lunchtime it started filling up as I imagine people who had just been to Topkapi Palace started to arrive. Therefore I'd recommend spending a morning at your leisure (if you have time). Enjoy!"

Built in what was previously the Topaki palace outer gardens, it is a complex of three archaeological museums, all covered by the one ticket priced at 15TL or included in the Istanbul museum pass. These include(1) The Archaeological museum \u2013 This house a fantastic collection of Turkish, Hellenistic and Roman artifacts. A real highlight is the alexander sarcophagus, believed to have been prepared for Alexander the great. (2) Museum of the ancient orient(3) Museum of Islamic artDespite the three buildings this museum isn\u2019t enormous and can be covered in around 3 hours. However, despite its close proximity I would recommend against visiting this place on the same day as Topaki palace, as this would essentially turn into a whole day of museums which may prove draining. There was a large amount of renovation work occurring when I was there and numerous closed exhibits which was disappointing.It is probably worth visiting, but I wouldn't be placing it high on your 'must sees' of Istanbul. I think it would rank around 6-7 in my book. Refreshingly, this attraction doesn\u2019t see the same level of tourist traffic as Istanbuls other tourist attractions. It is important to remember that like most museums it is CLOSED ON MONDAYS."

We were very interested in the first two and had planned on spending at least half a day there. There were very few people on the day we visited. This may be due to the fact that many parts of the Museum of Archaeology are currently under renovation. We did see a good collection of sarcophagi, but the more important ones such as the Alexander Sarcophagus, the Sarcophagus of the Mourning Women, the Satrap Sarcophagus and so on were all closed to visitors. The upper section for Ancient Troy was poorly lit and there were only small clusters of museum employees chatting in corners and a handful of visitors. Generally speaking, there are a lot of other artifacts and statutes on display, but we found them to be presented in a haphazard manner (perhaps due to the extensive renovations?), the heating was also on whilst we were there, making it fairly uncomfortable and we left after an hour or so.We also visited the Ceramics Museum. This small museum (one floor) houses a nice collection of tiles, including \u0130znik tiles from the period between the mid-14th and 17th centuries."

My favourite part was being able to get nose to nose with ancient monuments like Hitite statues, the animal mosaics from the Gates of Ishtar from Babylon, hieroglyph tablets from Ancient Egypt and Roman Imperial era marble statues and actually being able to touch them, and feel them, as they are not inside glass cases. I've never seen that in other museums. They have audio guides available, if you want more information or prefer not to read the wealth of info that they already have posted.

For me it is the singular most impressive archeological treasure (not excluding those in the Berlin Pergamon museum) after the Chin emperor's army in Xian, which exceeds it only in immediate visual impact.

Furthermore, the complex of museum houses a great array of pottery and tools from the Troy excavations. THE CONS : OLD-FASHIONED MUSEUMThe museum needs a face lift and a revamping of the antiquities information and placard. I think that the pieces are too great to go unnoticed with little / small / unclear placards of information. I also think that the museum is starting to look old on the inside and needs a more modern touch in the way antiquities are displayed or preserved in glass cases. It needs more interactive technology to engage the younger audience. A simple video that plays on loop in a room is lacking of technological advancement in museum studies."

There are signs in English at the entrance of each gallery with some explanation, but on the displays they are brief or absent. I rented the audio guide but was disappointed as the number of displays for which there were commentaries were few, plus the descriptions were actually briefer than that found on the walls; this is different to my experience with most museum audioguides. Still, i believe this is a work in progress as it seems to be a new feature in the museum. It is actually triggered by location as there are detectors in the entrance of each gallery that will trigger the guide if you step into a room. This is not a common feature even in more modern museums. The history of the kingdoms of anatolia and assyrian and hittite people on the third floor are interesting but lacks sufficient depth of explanation as one would see in well-curated museums of natural history.

After visiting (and loving!) the areas of the Hippodrome/Blue Mosque/Hagia Sofia, on day three we ventured up to the Topkapi Palace exhibits. For everyone complaining about the entrance fee, the site is an absolute bargain for 30 TL. Don't be deterred, you can spend a half day here easily if you take your time. Yes, they charge and extra 7 TL for a special side exhibit called the Harem Room, but if you've ever been to Turkey that's par for the course. We didn't do it and had a great time anyway.The best part of the museum is furthest from the main entrance. Just keep walking back, back, back...and you will find yourself on a large terrace overlooking the Bosporus. Truly magnificent. In that are you will also find some perfectly preserved Ottoman palace rooms and antechambers, and several very nice courtyards. These areas are by far the highlights of the entire museum.If Islam is your area of interest you will have several exhibits to enjoy that really play-up the role of the Ottomans in spreading and protecting Islam. In one area in particular, while reviewing artifacts, you get to hear someone recite the Koran over the PA system. It is not obtrusive and adds a nice mood to the experience. A few things are a bit over the top. They claim to be displayed the Sword of David, and the Staff of Moses. Seriously? There is so much hokey about that I don't know where to begin, but people seemed to be oohing and aahhhing plenty, so hey, as long as they're happy. Now, the bad...I know Istanbul is an international city, but how about some kind of crowd control? Some kind of flow to the exhibits? Several of the exhibit rooms consisted of one way in/out with no direction once in the exhibit space, so a throng flooded the room and everyone maneuvered to get a look at the artifacts in casings on the wall. Wait your turn, you may think? There is no turn. He/she with the sharpest elbows and rudest tendencies get to see what they want, while the rest of us civilized folks wonder what all the fuss is about. This is easily fixed with some $20 velvet rope and some arrows on the ground. Just establish some flow instead of the free for all that exists currently. Overall, this is well worth the trip and expense. The Hippodrome area is wonderful for the Roman influence and to get perspective for what Constantinople meant to human history (more that you can ever imagine), but you need to visit Topkapi to get a feel for the Ottomans."

Hundreds or thousands of sarcophogi, friezes, statues and more from Roman ruins all over are displayed in vast rooms, and you can walk unfettered among them. It's a bit like sauntering through a graveyard. Lighting is generally dim, and there's little more explanation of what you're seeing than a name, 2-3 word description and place (as if you were looking at flowers and given common and Latin names only). Much of the museum was under renovation when we visited which severely limited my options (because I'm mobility challenged and the ramps/elevator were in the area being worked on). But the pieces are beautiful (many of them) and the overall effect is to make the Greco-Roman world seem more real than it usually does."

There's an awful lot to see, so if you are interested in any one era/civilisation in particular, you should probably focus on that, as you could easily spend half a day on something like Troy alone.

I would have definitely given this a five star review if it hadn't been for all the construction at the time of our visit at the beginning of December 2014. We didn't get to see the Alexander or the weeping women sarcophagi because they were under restoration. If you are hoping to see these at some point in the near future, I would hold out until restoration is complete or at least call and ask. That being said, we saw some INCREDIBLE pieces and the audioguide was great at giving a decent amount of detail. You could spend a whole day here or look out for the audioguide symbols and see a good picture in 2-3 hours. The Orient collection and the items in the Old Building are the best in my opinion, definitely don't miss those."

There are several museums located throughout the Sultanahmet part of the Old Town that are wonderful; however, this is by far the most interesting museum of all.This museum has three wings: The Museum of Islamic Art, the Archeological Museum, and the Old Orient. The Old Orient wing has many displays associated with the original people of the region to include Hittites, Assyrians, and Sumerians. The artifacts in this wing are upwards of 4000 years old; however, a significant portion of the museum (downstairs) is closed for renovation.The Archeological museum is absolutely tremendous. The display on the history and creation of Troy is fascinating (2d floor) but the collection of Sarcophogi is not to miss. The featured sarcophagus is the one that depicts Alexander the Great; however, that particular piece is out for conservation. There is also significant construction throughout this wing creating several detours.For as much construction currently underway the museum should charge a lower price. The entrance fee is 50TL which is rather steep and one of the most expensive in the entire Istanbul area. If you are here for several days (minimum three), consider buying the museum pass for 85TL. If you happen to visit three places that charge for entry (Hagia Sophia, Topkapi with Harem, and the Archeological museum), you will easily find the value in the museum pass purchase. Also, the museum pass allows you to skip the queues at most sites."

To us, one of the most interesting parts was items from Schliemann's discoveries at Troy, because most of his things that had been in the museum in Berlin we \"stolen\" by the Russians after the WWII and will not be returned depriving anyone from seeing them. While the collection here is small compared to that which had been in Berlin, it is still fascinating. Also of great interest are the drawings depicting the various (I think 7) levels of Troy that were discovered while digging at Troy both by Schliemann and other who continued the \"dig\" after him. Sadly, it is difficult to find a sense of direction while the museum (several buildings in all) is under reconstruction."

The Alexander section was getting worked on and I wasn't sure if I wanted to go still...I'm so glad I didI could have spent a lot long than I did but so due to work in the building and my time limit I moved quickly though the buildings. However, feel like i got my monies with worth and got to see some amazing artifacts. The sarcophagus took my breath away when I walked in and tried to see them in the gallary, I was still able to see a majority of the ones written about in the tour books. They are AMAZING and well worth the trip to see. The rest of the museum has great marble and stone, has pieces from the time of different points in Istnabuls and the area's history. It was towards the end of our trip so i already had some context of where and what happened to place these objects. In the main part of the museum. The front and lay out of the building really goes back to the build up and development of the classics and birth of Archaeology and those fields- feels very much in line with what 1800-1900 men across Europe were building to house items brought back from there explorations. The tiles museum was really quick and a worth seeing, but after the Mosque and other stops was only so much tiles one can look at. The front of the building is amazing not to be missed or a few vantage points. The far east section has some great pieces that for those not traveling to other parts of Turkey (I wasn't) gives a nice look at the eastern traditions, art, and history. can be done rather quickly as well. It made me excited to explore the other archaeological museums around the world. Reading Sharon Waxman's loot was a reason for me to go to Turkey, and was great to bring that full circle."

While we waited though we were amused by a girl who kept taking photos of and selfies with an otherwise placid black cat. So there should be something to keep you busy while you wait!The museum is actually a number of museums, all located in a central area. There is a small and not very well-stocked cafe on the premises - though it did do excellent baklava! - and you can amuse yourself while you eat or drink by watching all the Istanbul local feline residents meandering around. One inside the Archaeological Museum, the collections are amazing - particularly the Ishtar gates. I had never seen any of the Ishtar gates before, but I was completely taken by them (many photos and selfies on my part later).

Essentially, after you pass through the main entrance you will be faced by a building on your left - well worth seeing the displays of ancient artefacts including oldest peace treaty about 2500 years ago. Then there is the tiling museum building - again, worth seeing. On your right there are two sections with tombs, and with Greek and Roman statues. The cafe area is a delight, shaded by trees or inside. NB you can use a Museum Card here if you purchased one, and it is also separate from The Topkapi, not within it."

There are 6 levels of eye watering exhibits.However, you must know what to look for there are some gems hidden among the collection. The Museum of the Ancient Orient was certainly my favourite. Rarely do you ever see exhibits from what is modern day Iran, Iraq and the near east, Syria and Lebanon. But they are here. Glazed tile images from the Ishtar Gate of Babylon are here and artifacts from the necropolis of Sidon which you must sit down and study to appreciate the amazing detail of these works. There is also the The Kadesh Peace Treaty (1258 BCE) (the worlds first ever peace treaty). When I visited in late September 2014 the buildings were being modified to ensure they withstand seismic activity. I would surely visit Istanbul from Australia again to visit just a handful of sites/sights and this would definitely be one of them."

The Alexander Sarcpphagus this year was not on view, but many other pieces were, and we saw and took pictures of this on our last visit. Also, they have a museum of tiles, not a great collection, but a beautiful building, the oldest secular building in the city, dating from 1452.The English explanations are perfect, and one can read them easily.

This museum does none of the above. It seems more of a random collection of items not organized or arranged in any specific era or region.

In fact, the Troy portion of the exhibit was very more interesting than the actual Troy site.

First, wish I knew BEFORE entering/scanning my Museum Pass the famous Aleander Sarcophagus wasn't available for viewing so I could have planned my 2nd-day itinerary better, and believe me I spent quite a bit of time researching my Istanbul stay. Second, the Museum Pass I spent 85 TL only allows you to enter once (they are scanned) so I couldn't jump over to Topkapi for a few hours and return to the Archaeological Museums at the end of my day, this was a frustrating limitation! Third, I felt rushed at the Archaeological Museum knowing I had to get over to Topkapi Place and the Harem before those lines got too long. So let me repeat this: The Famous Alexander Sarcophagus was NOT Available To View in September 2014 and with the Current Restoration Underway Doesn't Look Like It Will be Available For Awhile.Visit Topkapi FIRST and make the Harem your FIRST stop once inside Topkapi. The lines are very, very long inside and the Museum Pass doesn' t help. The Museum Pass only helps you avoid the line to get into Topkapi Palace.My favorite displays at the Archaeological Museums were the mummies, the earliest know Peace Treaty (Kadesh Treaty), and the Tiled Pavilion is a lovely sight."

It allows you to visit each of museums on the pass once in a 3-day period. You should try to visit these museums during the week, as weekends were visibly busier. However, in my opinion, if you have the time, I wouldn't try to cram in as many museums as you can in the three days, I would space them out just a little bit (and thus skipping the pass). That being said, though, we are the type of people that like to take our time, take photos, notice details, and we also like to purchase the guided audio tours. We were probably at the Archeology Museums for about 3-4 hours (and part of it was closed for construction). There are 3 different museums: Archaeological Museum, Ancient Orient Museum, and Tiled Kiosk Museum. If you are short on time, I think you'll still want to make it to all three, so pace yourself! Ancient Orient Museum has some AMAZING pieces...walls from Babylon, tombs from Egypt, and MUCH MUCH more! The Tiled Kiosk Museum doesn't take up too much time, but had some beautiful pottery, and it's most famous feature, the \"Fountain of Youth.\" The Archaeological Museum is where you'll need to pace yourself the most. Part of the museum was under construction when we were there, so we did not get to see everything. There were a lot of sarcophaguses and tombstones, then plenty of ancient findings. Honestly, this was my least favorite of the museums, but still incredible! If you are only in Istanbul for a few days, I would not consider this a \"must-do,\" but if you are planning a full trip in Istanbul, then I'd definitely add it to your itinerary!"

The archaeological museum is - like many other museums in Turkey and Greece - under restauration and not everything is accessible (2014). Nevertheless, there is still more than you can see within a 3-4 hour visit. In fact the museum is dispatched in three different buildings: ancient cultures of the near east and Mesopotamia, the main building with finds from Troy and many other important sites in Turkey and a presentation of Istanbuls history from the paleolithic to early modern times and a Fayence museem in a pavillion where the architecture alone requires a visit.Its a pity that the presentation is - with few exceptions, for example the sarcophages from Sidon - not modern and indeed quite old fashioned. If you are a fan of archaeology and history the enormous finds on display are impressive and you will be able to see some of the most important finds from Turkish Archaeology, but you should have same basic knowledge of Mediterranean and near eastern archaeology to enjoy this museum. Nevertheless, the garden cafe of the museum is quiet and peaceful place in a crowded city."

You could easily spend a day here, particularly since the little cafe in the center courtyard has not bad basic stuff, and is surrounded by gorgeous artifacts they simply can't fit under the museum's sizable roof, so they just kinda leave them sitting outside around the cafe. The ever present cats are friendly, so you won't lack for company while you take a break from the breathtaking glimpses into the past the museum offers. And the fact it seems to 'highbrow' for the cruise lines doesn't hurt the line situation either-there wasn't one when we visited, huzzah. OK, the 'one thing': It's not Alexander the Great's sarcophagus, it's a sarcophagus WITH depictions of Alexander on the outside.

You can see mummies, skeletons, sarcophagus, and many tablets and drawings there. Unfortunately a big part of the museum was under renovation but still we managed to be there for a whole day. One of the good things was the electronic audible guide the we rented at entrance that you can enter the number next to artifacts and it gives you a complete description about it, also it has sensors and some of the descriptions play automatically when you are next to an artifact. I recommend the audible guide since the staff there are mostly guards than guides and the descriptions next to artifacts are very brief."

The first pavillion is the smallest one, but it includes some of the bass reliefs from the Processional Way that led to the Ishtar Gate - beatiful glazed tiles with lions, dragons and cattle. The main pavillion is a huge construction that was under renovation, making it hard to move through the collection (I had to go back to the entrance by the same path). It is maybe too much information for a single visit: only the exposition dedicated to Troy - its discovery, the excavations, the many layers - could keep a history freak busy for hours. What I liked most about the museum is how the historic artifacts from the Istanbul area are displayed in context with the current locations. I strongly recommend that you visit this exposition AFTER you have taken a few strolls around the city in order to understand its geography.But the best is the third pavillion, the \u00c7inili K\u00f6\u015fk (Tiled kiosk): a small building covered with tiles that displays a limited collection of tiles. It is almost a test of how much beauty you can take. While inside the building, take a look at the high windows with stained glass: as you move, the double layer with different patterns play with our visual cortex as the colors seem to intensify and even move around.In between the visit to the pavillions, relax at the cafe in the sculpture garden. Their pistacchio cake, by the way, is quite good."

The order we saw places was Topkapi, Aya Sofia, Blue Mosque, Haggia irene and then this one which I think worked well for us. In the afternoon we went to Grand Bazaar."

The museum is well laid out although the descriptions of the artifacts were less developed than we are used to with British museums."

I have a feeling I missed a large part but I had museum fatigue anyway at that point. It takes you from the Stone age settlements, through the establishment of the early city state, the Greek and Roman conquest of the city, the establishment of Constantinople right through to the conquest by the Ottomans. This is where I seemed to have got lost as I couldn't find anything about the Ottomans onwards but no matter. Well worth seeing."

The Istanbul Archaeology Museums is a group of three archeological museums located in the Emin\u00f6n\u00fc district of Istanbul, near G\u00fclhane Park and Topkap\u0131 Palace.The Istanbul Archaeology Museums consists of three museums, Archaeological Museum, Museum of the Ancient Orient and the Museum of Islamic Art. In the most guidebooks, those writing about the museum is very little compared to what will you see. You make a journey into the time 5000 years ago. A large collection of Hellenistic period, Roman, and Turkish artifacts. You can see, the ornate Alexander Sarcophagus, believed to be prepared for Alexander the Great, the Alexander Sarcophagus, found in the necropolis of Sidon is among the most famous pieces of ancient art in the museum. The Kadesh Peace Treaty (1258 BCE), signed between Ramesses II of Egypt and Hattusili III of the Hittite Empire, is a favourite of visitors. It is the oldest known peace treaty in the world, and a giant poster of this tablets containing the treaty is on the wall of the United Nations Headquarters in New York City. Glazed tile images from the Ishtar Gate of Babylon, snake's head from the Serpentine Column erected in the Hippodrome of Constantinople, busts of Alexander the Great and Zeus, fragments from the temple of Athena at Assos, the Troy exhibit, artifacts from the early civilizations of Anatolia, Mesopotamia, Arabia and Egypt etc. It requires a full day to see everything with the right way or the minimum is 3 hours to have a small touch. If you love history it is a worthwhile visit."

It houses some very historical artifacts including Alexander the Great's sarcophagus (he's not actually buried in it, FYI) as well as the top of the Serpent Column that you would have seen in the Hippodrome. There was also a mummy of a some king in there....I tried to find more information on who he was online but only found info on his son. Opt for the guidebook, it is needed....it is also a bit of a maze, so be sure you aren't skipping anything."

The Orient Building is especially stunning. Truly, there is a lot of history can be found in this Museum covering a big area where human civilization was established.

You get very close to the exhibits, though the lighting is dim. The oriental building has lot of pieces from the Ishtar gate (Babylon, Iraq).

Definitely rent the audio for a better understanding of what you will be viewing. In particular, seek out the Kadesh, (first peace treaty), Hammurabi's Code, and the Oldest Love Poem. The various sarcaphagi - magnificent in the carvings and how they are displayed. Stop at the cafe for a good cup of Turkish coffee and a snack. Servers are very friendly and helpful. The grounds abound with many ruins. Be aware that about 1/2 of the museum's main building is currently closed - undergoing earthquake proofing and will not be accessbile. Allow about 2 -3 hours to wander thru the three buildings.

There are actually three separate museums that make up the Archaeological Museum: The Museum of Ancient Orient, the Tile Museum and the main Archeological Museum. (WHY? might you ask, is there an Ancient Orient museum in Istanbul? Oh silly, because Istanbul straddles both the European AND ASIAN continents) ... All three museums are as fascinating as the next! The museum is located on the edge of Topkapi Palace (follow the signs around town), and is open from 9:00 - 7:00, but they stop selling tickets an hour before it closes. We were ushered out about 20m before the hour - so be wary of your timing. It's just 10TL to visit the museum (but my preference is and suggestion would be to get the 72h Museum pass - it is WELL worth it if you plan on hitting them all). It's not crowded at all, so choose this one on a weekend day when the other museums are slammed.Not truly into the Ancient Orient, I went into this one with little enthusiasm, and boy was I surprised. The stuff in here is ANCIENT --- like REALLY old. Again --- If I had a little one, I would snag them out of school and make them learn the history of the world by going to Istanbul! Very informative. The Archeological Museum was very, very interesting. You could basically get an entire semester of Anatolia History out of your visit here. The sarcophagi are gorgeous - it is truly amazing what was carved (and still remains) from 300BC. For instance, the Alexander Sarcophagus was originally thought to have been the Abdolonymus (who died in 311BC) Sarcophagus, but in reality this thing was carved BEFORE his death! The artifacts located in the Arch Museum are truly fascinating - things from all over the surrounding area of the Anatolian region. The Mosaic Tile part of the museum was the most interesting to me. BEAUTIFUL handcrafts from AGES ago, including a beautiful, tiled mihrab from the 15th century with the most gorgeous blue glazed tiles you've ever seen.Do not miss this museum experience if you are in Istanbul!"

It is a good idea to rent the audio guide. The museum consists of three buildings, the Ancient Orient Museum, the Tiled Kiosk Museum and the main building and hosts an enormous collection which spans 5,000 years of history.

The wealth of culture, history, knowledge, tradition, romanticism and mystique that is present in this place is mind boggling. There are 3 buildings in this museum complex. The entry feeis TL 10. It can be approached from 2 sides. the first one is through the Topkapi place. As you enter the first courtyard (where no tickets are required) you will see the Hagia Irene church on your left. Just after the Hagia Irene there is a building that is closed off and by the side of this building there is a lane that leads down the slope. This leads to the museums - in fact there is a gate that mentions on top the name of the museums. the other approach is from the Gulhane Park side. As you cross the arches under the wall by the tramline (opposite The Sublime Porte) you will see the entrance gates to the park. on your right by the boundary of the park there is a road that leads up the slope. it turns to the right - just follow this and you will see the museum complex. the first building as you enter (to your left) is the museum of the orient. it has a large number of remnants from the walls of Babylon - the blue bricks and the lion, bull and dragon motifs are still alluring after so many centuries - apparently these are from the Ishtar Gate area. It is awe inspiring to imagine the impact they would have had on the unsuspecting (and even those who knew) visitor when they saw them for the first time on the walls. their magnificence even now is unparalleled. in addition, there are clay tablets (including apparently the oldest love poem!) that not only show you the development of writing but also that of commerce and archiving and contracting. it only goes to show that we have not really progressed that much since those times in certain areas - or to put it differently - the advancement achieved by those old people is a humbling experience.the second building on your left is the tiled pavilion - it has exhibits of ottoman ceramics and tiles. this is the weakest part of the entire museum. there is nothing great here - at least in comparison to the exhibits in the other sections. the building itself is quite pleasing. inbetween these two buildings is the museum shop and a cafe with open air seating amongst old ruins.the last and the grandest building is to your right and centre. this was built specifically to house the collections around the 1880s or 1890s. it is quite a grand building with a marvellous entrance. in the courtyard in front is a marble / stone column that is shaped like a palm tree trunk - if you are not careful you would actually think it is a real dead trunk - the worksmanship is so brilliant even after all these years. the main building is being renovated. however as you enter the main section, to your left is the area for the collection from the royal necropolis of Sidon. in the first chamber you see the two most famous sarcopahgii - the alexander one and the one of the weeping / mourning women. the wroksmanship is just brilliant. even after the ages it still is able to touch you to the core. one must visit this museum if just to see these two exhibits. for anyone who loves history this is manna. for those who love the arts this is sublime. for those who value neither it is best avoided. beyond the first room on the left is the balance part of the sarcophagus collection. there are a couple of good ones here also - two that come close to the two above. a quick look would suffice though. the upper floors on this side were not accesible. on the other side of the building - to your right as you enter are the exhibits related to Istanbul and the general geographical area of modern day Turkey. to me the most important artefacts here were the bust of alexander, the roman statues (inlcuding those of augustus, marcus aurelius and agrippina the elder). they are such beautiful works of art that they converse with you when you look at them and you get the distinct feeling that as you turn away from them so would they to walk with you as in a typical conversation you have with a friend who you meet suddenly on the street and then walk away together.on the upper floors the most interesting exhibits are again the clay tablets and records bearing contracts and receipts from the earliest times including those from the hittite period. these include a marriage contract (a pre-nuptial !!) detailing the moneies to be paid to either party in case of a divorce and a war treaty amongst others. really interesting. this apart the place is literally littered with artefacts of daily life from time immemorial and byzantine columns, arches, mosaics (a few) and busts and statuettes.overall a must must see for those who like history and are willing to transport themselves back to years gone by and marvel at the advanced art and science forms. just looking at the exhibits i mentioned above should take an hour. i spent half a day."

I was finally able to learn about the history of the famous Izmir tiles and see beautiful examples of them. I missed the Ancient Orient building completely, because I next went to the Archeology museum where I spent over 2 hours (without finishing!) and was completely knackered at the end.So many beautiful and important objects to see spanning approximately 600BC-400 AD. The graceful carvings tell myths and stories which the audio guide and signs help you to understand.The building has two wings (which I didn't realize) so I took my time in the first half without realizing how much more there was to see.

The Museum is currently undergoing renovations (as is every tourist attraction in Europe this winter, it would seem) but this does not detract from the experience. There is an extensive collection of artefacts from Turkey's past and the 4th century Alexander Sarcophagus, a staggeringly beautiful piece of work, apart from its historic significance -- ground floor, room to the left of the entry -- is hard to miss. The Museum is a bit of a maze, possibly due to ongoing work, and not well signposted. We had to ask for help to find the exhibition of Ravenna mosaics from the Basilica of San Vitale, Italy (closing end January) which we had come to see. The mosaics are re-creations of course, painstakingly well done using laser techniques and Murano glass, but just too perfect; a little wear and tear would have added to the authenticity. Some of the mosaics are monumental, all are highly coloured, beautiful representations of spiritual life in Byzantium. On the first floor, the exhibition of shipwrecks of Yenicapi is an added bonus. During excavation work for an underground transport tunnel in 2004, the Yenicapi site in Istanbul yielded a total of 37 shipwrecks, dating between the 5th - 12th centuries AD. Four of these shipwrecks are displayed. The cargo they carried, and the remains around the site, has helped build up a clearer picture of life in ancient times in the area. The exhibition is interactive and clearly aimed at students (groups were visiting when we were there) but is of great general interest.Perhaps the best part of the Museum visit and worth all of the 10 TL ticket price, is the Crystal Pavillion (Cinili Kiosk), a beautiful sugar-cube of a building, opposite the current entry to the Museum. It is a calm and beautiful space, a repository for ceramics and tiles of incredible artistry and skill. A painting by Osman Hamdi Bey, founder of the Museum, hangs in a side room, neatly connecting both buildings. Word of advice: Visit in winter. There were a few school groups but hardly any tourists and we were able to look at leisure..."

The Tile Kiosk includes many non-tile exhibits: the two world-famous plates are .... well .... outstanding. And don\u2019t miss the Kadesh treaty tablet.A significant section of the main museum was closed when we were there (Dec 2012) but it did not detract from almost a morning inside, and away from the rain."

Yes, it is undergoing renovation, but some of the buildings are open for viewing. Over thousands of years, this region has brought the eastern and the western cultures together, has hosted the magnificent buildings of the Byzantine and Ottoman Empires to the present, and has maintained its importance during all periods of history, all represented in some way in the museum.The most interesting exhibit I saw is that uncovered in about 2004 for the building of a major subway station at Yenikapi, on the Marmara. This excavation uncovered the harbor of Byzantium and a treasure trove of objects, including 36 boats. Some of the vessels and their cargo are on display and offer a rich guide to medieval life around the Mediterranean Sea.It has been reported that this is the most comprehensive archaeological excavation ever related to the history of \u0130stanbul. The harbor and the Yenikap\u0131 shipwrecks, dating from the 7th to 11th centuries, are a fascinating find and worth the trip!I hope the museum will continue to develop this exhibit."

This will give you access to the Istanbul Archaeology Museum, Topkapi, Topkapi harem, Haga Sophia and Chora museums. The pass is very convenient and saved us about 20 minutes time of queue for Topkapi and Haga Sophia.There are 2 noticeable themes in this museum. The first is the impressive burial relics- Sarcophagus collection. Look for the 5th century BC Sidon king and Alexander the great sarcophagus.The second theme is the Greek Statue collection. One will be amazed and think that he is in Athens instead of Istanbul. On the 2nd floor, the history of Turkey is displayed . Interesting part, because this will provide a better understanding of the country as you visit the other museums and attractions in the city latter on.A surprise bonus area is the Roman marble section on the ground floor. All the relics found in the museum are more than 2000 years old but very well preserved. The Underwater Istanbul port excavation exhibit is also well designed. There is also a tile pavilion on a separate building.Truly, there is a lot of history can be found in this Museum covering a big area where human civilization was established. If you are a history buff, 2 hours is not enough."

Deciding to spend a good part of our 33rd wedding anniversary at the Istanbus Archaeological Museum, we soon found ourselves walking past a friendly soldier with a machine gun guarding the outer portal leading toward the Topkapi Palace and into G\u00fclhane Park, hot on the trail of the museum, where we spent exciting afternoon hours gawking at the wonders on display, wonders it would take a dozen pages to do justice to. Let me just say that the sarcophagi, with their incredibly lifelike carvings, were amazing, and the statuary from Greek and Roman times so beautiful that I would have shot three or four rolls of film if such a thing existed any longer, so I shot dozens and dozens of digital photos instead. Most impressive to us both was the great Alexander Sarcophagus. It wasn\u2019t so named because it had ever contained the youthful remains of the great conqueror, but because it depicted his battles and hunts in beautiful carvings on all sides in deep relief. It had been found in the Royal Necropolis of Sidon and was carved in last quarter of the 4th century B.C. Carvings on one long side showed Alexander fighting the Persians at the Battle of Issus (in 333 B.C.), while on the other side Alexander and the Macedonians were hunting lions with the Persians. Spectacular carvings.  A portion of the museum was under reconstruction when we were there, but there was still plenty to keep us fascinated: anthropoid sarcophagi, grave steles, some with their paint still intact, memorials carved in stone, mosaics, friezes from the Lagina Hecate temple, the mummified remains of Tabnit, King of the Sidons, elegant Egyptian sarcophagus lids, beautiful busts and statues of emperors and gods, a great head of the poet Sappho, the magnificently mournful reclining figure of Oceanus, god of rivers, and on and on. We nipped out for a quick lunch of sandwiches and baclava at a little caf\u00e9 in the garden, surrounded by feral cats and ancient stone, and nipped back in to visit the ancient Hittite carvings and Egyptian remnants from several centuries before the Greco/Roman era. It was past four when we finally left, our feet having received the bastinado but our spirits still flying high. Well worth your visit. The Archaeological Museum in Antalya is, I think, even more stunning."

Like all of the major museums we visited in Turkey, this was a model of how valuable artifacts should be displayed and annotated: crisp and interesting descriptions in English as well as Turkish supported by lucid explanatory maps and diagrams. The collection itself, as well as the three major buildings that house them, are of the highest order. The largest is the original museum, initiated in 1881. It contains a stunning collection of Greek and Roman sculptural art focused predominantly on row after row of Sarcophagi ------ large, richly decorated, and superlatively carved down to the tiniest detail. Look out for the Sarcophagus of Alexander the Great ( now known to have nothing to do with the great conqueror), and those of the Crying Women and the Satrap. On the other side of the hall you will find many of the greatest examples of Greek statuary that have survived theft and destruction, notably full-length versions of Alexander, Cybele, and Valentinian ll (Roman), as well as brilliant busts of Alexander and Zeus. A lot of space is given to the archaeological development of Istanbul that turns out to be a nice way of getting to know the details of its complex history. A small section of artifacts from Troy is also tucked away.Opposite this building is the Museum of the Ancient Orient. Started in 1883, it contains acollection of remarkable items from the Babylonian and Assyrian civilizations, including fascinating steles, cuneiform tablets, and huge tiled pictorial animals that originally adorned the famous gate of Ishtar. Examples of Egyptian and Byzantine art are also to be found. Alongside it is the absolute gem called the Tiled Kiosk. It represents an aristocratic Islamic home, and is decorated throughout with tiles, mosaics, ceramics, calligraphy, and sparkling multi-coloured stained-glass windows, and is worth the price of admission alone. This is only 10 TL, but remember that Monday is closing day."

This is perhaps the most complete museum in the whole of Turkey and in fact, there are even artifacts ranging from Egyptian ones which I personally feel were quite irrelevant and random.Other than that, this museum has a lot of items on display with some rare finds. This includes the original copy of the world's very first contract (peace treaty) between the Egyptian and the Hitties. Amazing stuff if you ask me.There are 4 main buildings here and each display different artifacts. Overall, this is a good place to learn about the history of ancient Turkey."

This is a lovely museum complex, with a large central building housing all sorts of archaeological artefacts, a second museum of mosaics, and a third with finds from Mesapotamia (specifically tiles from the Gate of Ishtar in ancient Babylon). Overall, this is a delightful place because most of the tourists are busy with the more major sites and are not at this one!HOWEVER, beware that some parts of the museum are closed for restoration. My husband and I came here specifically because we wanted to get a longer chance to view the remarkable finds from Syria and Lebanon, things that one does not normally see in archaeological museums. But the entire third floor (second floor, if you are European) was closed. Most tourists, however, would find the major items, such as the Sarcophagus of Alexander, available. But expect to see a lot of scaffolding and dust."

The history of the modern man becomes miniscule, the realization of how temporary our current states, languages, nations after all are is stunning. Personally what i found the most touching piece, was a tombstone that a man had made for his dog, appraising their mutual friendship. That brought the individuals everyday -perspective in, assuring that history is not just about nations' major events, but also has the humane aspect that is often overlooked.

This is the outstanding work of art held in this museum and it is reason enough to visit. What is it? It is a 4th century BCE Hellenistic marble sarcophagus with bas-relief carvings, some of which still contain color, depicting Alexander the Great. The carvings are excellently preserved and beautiful. Each side of the piece depicts a different scene from Alexander the Great's life including warfare and hunting. If your children have greater patience -- or you are without children -- then spend even more time in this remarkable museum with its collection of ancient Greek, Roman and Byzantine art.

I'm a history-head who loves to linger and ponder on the artefacts on display but the soup-like humidity drives you to distraction and also drives you back out the front door. The annoyance is confounded by the maze of beige corridors that ultimately are a dead end and you have to back track all your steps to get back outside.

It costs 72 TL and includes a single entry to 9 museums, including Haghia Sophia, The Chora Church, Topkapi Palace plus the Harem Apartments and Mosaics Museum. When you use this card, bear in mind what day the museum is closed. As some of the Tripadvisor reviewers advised, we bought our Museum passes here as there was no queue at the ticket office as it was at the other sites such the Haghia Sophia or Topkapi Palace. That was a great advice and I am very grateful for that. Without any hustle we entered the museum. I did little research before arriving so I was not sure what to expect. Truly, this museum turned out to be one of the greatest in Europe. I would stay here for hours, and this is the place I would visit again if I ever returned to Istanbul. From the colossal statue of Bes (holding up a headless lioness by her hind paws) in the lobby to the very end of my visit (which ended on my way to the toilet) every artefact was a valuable piece of history. The first few rooms contain a number of extraordinary sarcophagi form the sixth century BC. Going further, you find the room with one of the most magnificent sarcophagi here \u2013 one of Alexander the Great, so-called not because it is that of Alexander himself, but because it is adorned with sculptures showing Alexander in scenes in hunting and war in vivid 3D. Another outstanding sarcophagus is the one of the Mourning Women (4th century BC). This one shows eighteen members of the harem of King Straton (who died in 360 BC) in various poses of mourning. Other rooms offer some great statues such as the Head of the poetess Sappho and the reclining God of the rivers (2nd century AD). Don\u2019t miss the mosaic of Orpheus of 194 AD where you can see how Orpheus was taming wild animals with his lyre. There are notes in English which come in handy. Unfortunately, my time was limited and I could not see all exhibition rooms but hopefully, I will be back."

They have one brand new exhibit about shipwrecks which embodies everything museology is supposed to be about-- engaging, interactive, multimedia, thematic, interrogative, investigative... But the rest of it plays more like an art museum. Still, I'm an apostle of the 75 TL museum pass which includes admission here, and for that reason, it's definitely worth a visit."

However in my mind before i went there, i had been to Ephesus, Afrodisias, and read about pergamon. When at those places they tell you that some of the best pieces had been taken to this museum. i guess i was hoping that when we got there it may have said where it was found, or grouped them as such (even though group by era is of course better) and maybe a photo of where in relation to anything else it was found. There are clearly so many ancient artifacts that they dont know where to put them all. You will even see some in the hallway to the toilet. It's amazing how quickly you become immune to ancient artifacts by age. Instead of \"wow, thats a thousand years old, you end up sort of thinking, \"blah - only a thousand years old, theres 4000yr old stuff everywhere,whats 1000yrs\". It's an interesting sort of mind change to watch - especially with my daughter, from Australia where we dont have anything older than 200yrs old. Nice place to visit for the great pieces but i have seen museums much better set out than this one."

They deal with the the very long period of settlement in what is now Istanbul looking at the historic fragments from the paleolithic through Byzantium, Constantinople and its transformation, to the present. There is also much from the area that the Ottoman Empire once controlled. It is impressive, ancient and redolent of Old Testament history. In many ways it compares favourably with the archaeological treasures that were spirited away to London, Berlin and Paris. In the middle of the museum complex is a lovely cafe in which to drink tea, play with the kittens, and think about the treasures."

The collection of ancient artifacts, mainy marble sculptures from all over the Ottoman Empire, is outstanding and not to be missed. It was formed during the final years of the Empire and includes objects from Thasos (Greece) and Lebanon. The finest and richest section comprises sculptures from Istanbul itself ranging from antiquity to the Byzantine period. A part of the Museum is being refurbished and therefore closed. I have two complaints: 1) there are not enough seats for visitors except near the sarcophagus of Alexander and in the Troy section 2) the important exhibits in the garden do not have labels and there is no information about them. A scenic cafe is located in the garden ovelooking the marble collection assembled there."

In a 3 hour visit we did not even scratch the surface of its treasures although I did stand beside the sarcophagus of Alexander the Great. If you plan to visit I recommend you do a little research before hand and pick the exhibition you wish to see rather than try to take in everything in a single visit - you just cannot do that and your brain will trip out if you try.Be warned that this is not a visit for children under the age of 10 - there are no interactive displays, playparks, theme areas or any of the other attractions for children you might associate with British museums. The displays are presented primarily for students or for people with a genuine interest in history/archeology. If you fall in to this category the museum is magnificent and awesome.

There is really a lot to see so if you have limited time I suggest focusing on one or two of the 8 galleries. If you have any interest in the history of Istanbul itself, the section on Istanbul through the Ages alone is worth a visit. Also, the Tiled Pavilion across the courtyard from the main entrance has a wonderful collection of ceramics and is well worth a visit.

It is easy to miss this jewel amongst all the other wonders Istanbul has to offer, but it's well worth the half day or more if you can manage it.This is comprised of 3 museums - the archaeological museum, the ancient orient museum and the tile museum.Visited the first two with family (including two kids aged 10 & 14) during late June 2013.Highlights: 1. The museum architecture itself is impressive, inspired by the greek neoclassical style. 2. The sarcophagi in the 'Necropolis of Sidon' section - including the amazing Alexander Sacrophogus, the Sacrophgus of the weeping women and the Lycian tomb. Worth the admission fee right there. 3. The glazed tile images from the Ishtar gate of Babylon, along with other antiquities from the great Sumerian and Akkadian civilizations. Worth the admission fee. 4. Portions of the 'Code of Hammurabi' on a clay tablet, dating from around 1750 BC. 5. Part of the 'Treaty of Kadesh' - the first known treaty between two regions. 6. Statues from ancient byzantium, greek and roman times. 7. One of the heads of the ancient 'Serpentine' columnAnd so on ..Lowlights: 1. The internal layout is not very clear or logical, can make it a bit difficult to navigate. 2. There are sculptures and other artifacts scattered outside, in the yard, in the cafe, etc. While this lends a somewhat unique feel to the museum, it also makes it difficult to see everything in a reasonable time. 3. Not all artifacts are clearly labelled or described sufficiently. The audio guide is useful, but inadequate. 4. The 'guides', while helpful, do not seem to be very knowledgeable.In summary, this is certainly one of the great archeological museums around. Definitely spend a few hours here and hit the highlights."

The Istanbul Archaeological Museum is actually three museums: The Archaeological Museum, the Ancient Orient Museum, and the Tiled Kiosk Museum. All of them are worth a visit; one could easily spend half a day here, with a break for a tea in the lovely tea and sculpture garden in the central courtyard. At a minimum, you need three hours to do any justice to this fabulous place. In the Ancient Orient Museum the cuneiform exhibit houses two not to miss items: the world\u2019s oldest love poem, and the Treaty of Kadesh\u2014the world\u2019s oldest extant peace treaty. It also has panels from the Babylonian Ishtar Gate. There is so much more that, as I write this, I feel that one could easily spend 3 hours alone just seeing this collection. The main exhibits are in the Archeological Museum which features, among countless treasures, the justly famous Alexander Sarcophagus, but here too, I was fascinated by the well preserved mummy of the Sidonian King Tabnit (5th Century BC). Looking at this mummy I was impressed, and somewhat disconcerted by the fact that the king\u2019s viscera was mummified as well, nearly filling the hollow chest cavity below the ribs! Make sure to read the history of the genius behind the Archaeological Museum, Osman Hamdi Bey which is presented in the foyer just before entering the galleries with all the sarcophagi. He was perhaps the first renaissance man of modern Turkey, lawyer, diplomat, scholar, painter, intellectual\u2014a totally fascinating man. Lastly, there is the smaller, but nonetheless, wonderful Tiled Kiosk Museum which details the history of Turkish ceramics with beautiful displays; the place is also unusually cool inside, so that on a really hot day, the place is truly relaxing; in fact, the guards had a heater going to warm themselves when we were there. One final reason for wanting to visit this great complex of museums is that, unlike Topkapi, and Aya Sofya which are right next door, the museums are not crowded so that the visitor is free to walk around without being squeezed, which allows for the contemplation of the marvelous treasures."

It is very impressive array of exhibits covering thousands years of history over an area .You could easily spend few days in this museum.The collections in the Archelogical Museum of Istanbul are breathtaking in general. Alexander the Great's sarcophagus, amazing to be standing in front of the first section on the left side of the entrance.Courtyard of the museum is a beautiful building which houses the tile and ceramics museum together with a lovely cafe which overlooks Gulhane Park. The museum itself is varity of statues and the best collections are on the ground floor. The upper floors contain exhibits relating to Troy.A fascinating museum that takes you on a journey through ancient history. I advise you to buy Museum Pass covers all the major sites ( Topkapi Palace, including the Harem, Hagia Sophia, Chora Church and Archeological Museum ) Cost is 72 TL - but it expires in 72 hours. I believe you can get them online before you travel to Istanbul.I highly recommend this museum to all!"

This museum is truly world-class as well as being located close to the old district of Istanbul, tokapi palace and numerous other interesting sites such as Gulhane park etc. The best time to go and visit is late afternoon during the week,otherwise you will be amongst huge crowds vying to see Alexander's sarcophage etc, especially from mid June until early September. And no I would not cancel my trip because of the present uprisings although personally I fully support what they are trying to accomplish, it would still not deter me from visiting this lovely city, as 99 percent of the population are still going about their regular daily activities."

Well preserved relics and sarcophagi with ancient scriptures and carvings gives you goose bumps specially on the account that people that used to use these stone coffins dates back during and even earlier than biblical times. There are 3 museums in one compound and you just need to pay 10 Turkish Lira to enter them all. It's a good deal specially to historians and young people alike who just loves watching movies like \"The Da Vinci Code\". I recommend visiting this place and I would again on my next visit to the country."

Its located very close to Tokapi palace and is a nice place to get away from the crowdsI am no expert on ruins but this really was a huge collection, of well preserved, and well documented artifacts. The rooms are fairly dark but cool and there is enough space to walk around and take your time to review. I am no expert, or even that interested in ruins but this place definitely kept my attention and there was enough information to help me understand and appreciate what I was looking atThe house of tiles is also within the same grounds.My only complaint is that its not really obvious from the outside, whats actually in the buildings, and it actually all looks closed, so a few signs pointing people in the right direction would have been good!"

There are three museums on the grounds with just one admission, which is included in the 72 hour Istanbul Museum Pass. The grounds are very near to both Hagia Sophia and Topkapi Palace making this a great place to take a break from the crowds and hectic atmosphere of both those sites. The Tiled Kiosk museum of Turkish ceramic works can be breezed through, but is notable for being one of the oldest non-religious civic buildings in Istanbul. The museum containing ancient Mediterranean and Turkish artifacts was undergoing renovation when we visited but most of the highlights of the collection were on display including the can't miss Alexander Sarcophagus and a portion of the Byzantine harbor chain.Notable in the Ottoman artifacts are the more delicate pieces of historical sites throughout the city, including the only remaining part of one of the heads of the three snakes forming the bronze column in the Hippodrome.The museum of the Ancient Orient is a must see. The ancient clay tablets are fascinating, and the glazed bricks of the gates of Babylon are beautiful.The museums were quiet and uncrowded when we visited. The garden cafe is a lovely place to relax surrounded by broken bits of classical statuary. If you have the time and the museum pass definitely make it a point to stop by."

I suggest starting at the \"Orient\" - but keep to 30 min. You get to see some pretty wonderous reliefs and kids will be really grossed out by the mummies! Head to the main building and hang a left... DO NOT go upstairs! unless you are really keen on a lot of pottery, and bits an pieces of Istanbul history or Troy ( actually the movie on Tory was pretty good but the sound system was very poor). Instead, head straight and get down to the Sidon excavations because they are breathtaking! After, go to see the tiles!. They have been pretty selective so you are only seeing a few truly excellent displays. After you leave, you can go out the front gates and turn right - going down the road to the bottom where there is a lovely treed park, or hang a left and go up back toward the main entrance to th Topkapi Palace. BEST piece of advice - get a Museum pass as the one pass covers all the major sites ( Topkapi Palace, including the harem, Aya Sophia, Chora Church, Arch. Museaum and a few more, and saves you hours of standing in line. Just present your pass and walk right by the long lines!!! Cost is 72 TL - but it expires in 72 hours. I believe you can get them on line before you even get to Istanbul - visit www.muze.gov.tr - but we got ours at an automatic kiosk in front of the Topkapi palace - The machines take Credit cards... but a word of warning, the machines seem to be tempermental"

It was pretty interested but large and full of information so if you've already visited a major site, you may want to see it on another day so that you can fully appreciate all the exhibits and information."

There is much else to draw your attention, including some of the original tilework figures from the Babylon gate. If you are in Istanbul, and you've gone to the major venues, don't skip this one.

All three are worth visiting, but I'm going to focus on the main museum. Unfortunately in May 2013, it was a bit early in the tourist season and they were renovating one of the wings, but it did not deter from enjoying the museum. They first floor has a special exhibit for the necropolis at Sidon. The sarcophagi from Sidon are amazing, especially the Alexander Sarcophagus. The other thing that was quite amazing was the layout of the building. One of the levels is laid out in chronological order, showing the evolution of the Anatolia region by period. It's amazing to see the cultural progression as you walk down the hall. You can see the pottery and other artifacts from each period and the transition throughout the ages. Overall, highly recommended. It's perfect for a half-day activity if you're trying to slowly see the various sites in Istanbul. If you're in a rush to see everything because you only have 1-2 days, it's still worth the trip to walk through as it's only 10 lira."

I was impressed because the courtyard has the air of Greece in it. I feel like walking in Athens for a while. You can even see rows of sarcophagus outside the museum building, each with their own stories to tell. The inside of the museum really need your 100% commitment. You will be greeted by Mustapha Kamal Attaturk's bust at the entrance. From there, you will spend at least an hour to look at all the sarchopagus of previous Kings and Queens, the hierogliff inscripted on it, the notes describing each items, the illustration from 3D and many more. Make sure to bring cameras because you are allow to take picture inside. Do not forget to have a short visit to the museum shop. There are various unique souveniers here. Things like mugs, bookmarks, books, hierogliff on papyrus (immitation, of course), vases, t shirts, shoes, scarfs and the list goes on. Prices are reasonable.Having said all that, I must say this museum would be a nice place to visit for historical buff.

You can spend all day roaming from building to building and security started herding us toward the exits about 10 minutes before closing. Also, as other reviewers stated, there is a small cafe on the grounds, but if you're looking for a full meal, I would eat elsewhere. It's just a place to rest and have a snack and a cola or cup of tea. The entrance fee, at 10TL, is a steal. For me, the highlights included the Sarcophagus Room, seeing one of the three known tablets of the Treaty of Kadesh (1274 BC!), and the Tiled Kiosk Museum housing ancient painted tiles and pottery. Just being so close to Hittite, Assyrian and Babylonian artifacts was mind blowing. Even after the museum is closed, you can wander around beautiful G\u00fclhane Park and sip tea at the hilltop cafe overlooking the Bosphorus. Incredible! Don't forget that the museum is closed on Mondays!"

For me, the most interesting collections were the sarcophagi and the clay tablets, but I am sure that anyone with an appreciation of history could find something worth seeing. We found that the museum was not crowded but, sadly, some of the collections were closed (apparently due to lack of personnel which probably leads back to lack of funds). So be sure to visit and contribute to this excellent museum's survival.  A word of advice, some of the rest rooms for women are not WC's but squat toilets. In the rest rooms I saw, there was one booth with an ordinary toilet and one with the squat model. "

Also the Archaeology Museum is covered by the Istanbul Museum Pass which gives you entrance to a number of places including Topkapi Palace, the Hagia Sofia, Chora Museum, and a few others for 72 TL for 72 hours.

The Royal Necropolis of Sidon and the collection of sarcophagi as a whole, are truly unique. There are many other interesting departments. Oriental collections are maybe not as unique (you can see comparable ones in London, Paris, Berlin, and New York), but still extremely impressive, especially the Hittite artefacts. Other departments, such as Troia, architecture of Byzantium/Constantinople, mosaics, etc., etc. also deserve a visit.However, beware that the museum is currently under restoration, so that various parts are temporarily closed at different times. One very important aspect, this museum amply illustrates, is the degradation of art and life under Islam, as compared with ancient civilisations, not to say Byzantium."

Only 10 TL to get in, and another 10 TL if you want the audio guide, this was a very good value for money. Ended up spending nearly 3 hours inside, and it even has a little cafe that you can drink your turkish tea amongst the rellics. There are some excellent examples of marble sculpture, that you will just wonder at how they did them over 2000 years ago. Some of the pieces that have been put out in the gardens would be other museums prize pieces.

This came in handy later in the day when we wen to Hagia Sophia and sailed in without waiting.

All the exhibit labels are in English and the information is well written and informative. (an audio guide is available) We used the Rick Steves Istanbul guidebook that had a nice map and explanations about many of the exhibits. Overall between the three buildings it took my husband and I about 4 hours to look at everything, although you could walk through much faster and get just about as much out of your visit; we like to linger at each exhibit. There are so many exhibits that each person will have their favorite; I liked the huge impressive sarcophagus, my husband liked the first peace treaty written in stone; there is something for everyone. The value is great, a ticket is only 10 TL (about $5.50 USD), for that price everyone should go!! Another idea to consider is wrapping the museum into part of a day tour. If you get off the tram at the Blue Mosque stop you can do all the nearby attractions (Hagia Sophia, Cisterns, Hippodrome, Blue Mosque, Topkapi palace, textile museum, etc) finishing with the archeological museum. This may seem like a lot but everything is so close and each attraction takes so little time to go though. if you keep heading down the hill you will end up at the new Mosque/spice market (if you are still looking for things to do). Overall I was extremely pleased with the exhibits and the value, I recommend it to anyone visiting Istanbul!"

There are two separate museums here, the Museum of Archeology (with the Alexander Sarcophagus and the Greek and Roman statues) and the Museum of the Ancient Orient. While everyone focuses on the Sarcophagi, the greatest thrill for me was seeing all the Babylonian friezes from the Ishtar Gate. Unlike the Pergamon Museum in Berlin, you can walk up and almost (but don't!) touch these, and there are a number of lions, dragons, and bulls. Their colors are bright, and this little gem was the highlight of our visit (and my day)."

We were the first visitors to arrive in the morning and had the entire place to ourselves. There were a few very interesting items on display like the world's oldest treaty and various other written contracts, letters, poems, etc. carved in stone. Other items included pieces from Egypt and Rome. Along with the exhibits were descriptions on the history of the region, which I found to be interesting and helpful. Although it may not live up to everyone's expectations, it is still worth a visit, even if only to get a history lesson out of it.

It is a must visit on even the briefest trip to Istanbul for anyone interested in the classics, Greek, Hellenistic or Roman civilization and the archaeology of Mediterranean civilizations. Other reviews cover the wide range of treasures so I'll confine myself to effusive praise for the Alexander Sarcophagus, one of the most important and interesting objects one can see from ancient times. Created in the late 4th century BC this massive object (over six feet / two meters high) is in near-perfect condition. It is carved in the form of a Greek temple and retains highly visible traces of the original strikingly vivid colors. For this reason, it is one of the very few objects from ancient times that give one an impression of what such temples and such ancient art actually looked like. The abstract, white marble one associates with ancient art is about as far from the ancient reality as it is possible to get - in ancient times these marble objects were brightly painted in vivid colors. The extraordinary detail and fine preservation of the Alexander Sarcophagus gives a true-to-life impression of what the temples must have been like, with elaborate roof decorations (acroteria) crowning finely detailed courses of decoration around the roof and brightly colored battle scenes inside the temple's pediments.For people interested in ancient history or art this one object alone is worth the flight to Istanbul. Add the many other astonishing objects in this museum and you have a \"must see\" museum in a \"must see\" city."

I had particular interest in seeing the 2,500 bas-relief tiles from the Processional Way leading to Babylon's Ishtar Gate, and these are well presented and did not disappoint, Other artefacts from the region are exihibited there too, presented for the most part so one can inspect them closely.In an adjacent building is the 2.300 year old Alexander Sarcophagus, from Sidon. It is a truly astonishing object, with bas-relief carvings of battle and the hunt of outstanding beauty and in a remarkable state of preservation - it looks almost as if it were executed yesterday. I didn't know this was in the museum and to come to it unexpectedly and see it with fresh eyes was a real delight.

Great artifacts, interesting bits of sculpture out in the yard next to the restaurant, next to a lovely park. But the written interpretation (e.g. not audio guide) is fairly minimal throughout the museum complex, and the newer building looks like it dates from the 1960s and isn't really maintained. There's some work apparently going on inside, since part of it was fenced off (but you could see an interesting looking building facade through the separation) but nothing was happening when we were there. It was *hot* outside when we were there, and the building doesn't seem to be air conditioned, though windows open at either end of the second and third floor hallways helped a bit.The older buildings in the museum complex are much nicer and more interesting. This is a good museum if you're on a longer trip - but I'd go to Topkapi, Hagia Sofia, some of the nicer mosques, the Istanbul Modern, etc., before I'd go here."

            "review": "Extensive collection with minimal guidance. The price for the museum is much better than the prices for neighboring attractions, such as Hagia Sophia or Topkap\u0131 palace. Walk as if going to Topkap\u0131 palace, and then turn left just after you pass Hagia Irene. There is a main building, a smaller kiosk with Ottoman ceramics, and an outdoor section consisting of grave monuments. It was not very crowded when we went on a Saturday in December, but there were still people behaving rather inappropriately for the location, for instance by talking loudly on a cellphone or taking pictures with a flash when there are clear signs asking you not to do so. Although there are guards in nearly every room, they seemed to have no interest in enforcing polite behavior. Fortunately it was empty enough that the experience was not sullied by the occasional rude person.The archaeological museum has an extensive collection. We spent three hours there, and by the end we had antiquities fatigue and rushed through the last bit. The first part is Greek-influenced Egyptian saracophaguses. After that is an extensive collection of Greek and Roman grave stelae. Another section covers prehistoric times. There are some Byzantine tiles, but this period is sadly rather underrepresented. In some parts of the museum, the pieces are well-labeled in both English and Turkish. This was the case for the stelae. But in most of the rest of the museum, the labels were very cursory, and it was not possible to learn very much about the objects. It isn't always clear what is original and what is a reproduction. The museum is also not very organized; there is no overview and no direction signs indicating the different sections to ensure that you see them all. Sometimes the only way to move to the next section is by retracing your steps. It isn't evident that the detached building housing the Ottoman ceramics is part of the museum.The displays were mostly somewhat out-of-date compared to how things are usually arranged in modern museums, which gave the impression that funds are lacking. You won't find interactive exhibits or movies (which is not a loss as far as I'm concerned, as I feel they add nothing to the experience). The lighting was surprisingly good in many places, however, so it is clear that someone cares about the collection. But what gave me the greatest impression of age was the lack of discussion of ethical questions which are found in most museums with these types of collections. For instance, a few minor pieces which were found at the same time as the lost the Trojan gold were presented without reference to the destruction Schliemann caused to the upper layers. The only evidence of some of the controversy of pre-19th century finds was a large sign commemorating the rightful return of a fresco; if there is any similar debate about pieces which came from places outside of modern Turkish borders, you will not find evidence of it in this museum.It was also distressing to see many old stone carvings sitting outside to be abused by the soot and acid in the air and rain. The space is clearly inadequate for the size of the collection. Some objects inside were crammed into too small a space, such as the busts of Roman emperors, Agrippina, and Alexander the Great, which are crammed into a narrow hallway.It is remarkably uncluttered with gift shops and similar nonsense. If you enjoy a good museum visit with minimal hand-holding, this is a good place to visit. You're allowed to take pictures without the flash, which many museums have banned. If you're looking for something which has been packaged for novices, this museum may not be for you. You need a working knowledge of the history of the region to appreciate it. It is probably also more suitable for adults than small children."

Our family had been in Istanbul site-seeing for a week and our last day was designated for \"mopping up,\" i.e. revisiting the markets for last minute purchases, going back to a favorite restaurant, etc. We ended up with the afternoon pretty much free and so we decided, \"what the heck, let's check out the archeology museum.\" What a fortunate choice! The collections are marvelous and give a fantastic indication of just how \"ancient\" ancient history really is. Moreover, nearly every single artifact has English as well as Turkish posted descriptions, which made it easy to learn and appreciate the displays. The tile mosaics from the Ishtar Gate in Babylon are wonderful, well-preserved and well-displayed. The cuneiform exhibit had an accounting ledger containing foodstuffs and XX quantities of beer from what is now Lebanon in 2500 BC. Who knew beer was from the Levant? We didn't!My daughter is an art historian and I am a dabbler, my son is a field biologist. In other words, we were wired for this, him, not so much. Having said that, we all were truly dazzled. I think my son was a little surprised to have enjoyed it so thoroughly. What a great way to spend the afternoon!"

The Turkish Archaeologist Osman Hamdi Bey was unknown to us as Westerners ( 'way West - try Australia ) but he seems to have been the Turkish equivalent of Leonardo da Vinci. This museum alone would ensure his lasting, deserved, fame. Probably his single most memorable find was Sinon, from which an amazing collection of sarcophagae, stellae, and other grave markers has been preserved. The condition of these relics is the best we have seen in our visits to several counties. The sarcophagae carvings are high-relief, and be spite some minor damage and missing portions, the carvings mostly look as if they were done recently - some of the marble even retains traces of original paint.This museum also has a wide range of early cultures, Palestine, Syria, and Cyprus, among others. There's also a thorough study of Troy - I am still personally unclear as to which of Troy's 10 stages was the one Homer immortalized, but this museum says that stage 7 was destroyed by fire around 1000 BC. The museum is user- friendly ( by that I mean the exhibits are well-spaced and presented ) and pleasantly uncrowded ) -that is an excellent reason for coming in December! We would still rate Athens museum of archaeology a little higher, based on sheer scale and number of artifacts, but the Istanbul Archeological Museum is one of the most worthwhile visits we have made during our year in Europe."

Along with the Pergamum Museum in Berlin, Germany, this is the best collection of archeological finds from Turkey. The section on Istanbul is fascinating--artifacts and information on the evolution of the town from Constantinople to Istanbul. There is one section devoted to the excavations at Troy which are very complicated; a visit here may help in your understanding of the 9 different civilizations or timeframes that have been identified. Many archeological sites of the Middle East (to include Syria, Lebanon, and present-day Israel) are represented here since the Ottoman Empire controlled all that area.

From Alexander, Athena, to Augustus, just to start with the A Team, many sculptures and busts are displayed beautifully. We spent three hours there, but it was not enough, never made it to other sections that featured other cultures.This Museum complex, which includes three major buildings, is currently being enhanced by the city. It is in proximity to the fabulous Cisterns beneath the streets of Istanbul, that we were determined to see this time, not included in our tour two years ago. Anyone who sees Medusa's famous head upside down in these amber-lit CISTERNS with over 200 pillars erected into the ceiling, will never forget her.....utterly Bizarre !!We intend to return to Istanbul for the third time...it was briefly featured last night in the Amazing Race, the teams discovering very briefly the Spice Market and the Bazaar which are, like everything else in this unusual city, beyond description !!"

I thought the artifacts from Troy would be my favorite, but the other parts of the museum trumped them. I think this is a little appreciated attraction in Istanbul."

One warning-the ticket does not allow you to leave and return, and the only place for food is an outdoor cafe with a beautiful setting and a very limited selection of really bad food, such as an arugula salad with no dressing and a cheese sandwich made from three slices of white bread. I recommend you try and take in some food, and find a nice outdoor place to sit and eat."

Situated close to other main attractions in Sultanahmet, the museum is easily reached on foot. There are so many items in the collection and some very special ones. It is a bit like visiting the Louvre in Paris; you can't examine everything in one visit. However, the guide gives you a list of 'Must See' items of the collection. For example there is a tablet of part of the first treaty - the Treaty of Kaddesh which I was particularly interested in seeing as I have read a lot on Egyptian history. The cafe is a little disappointing and it would be good if they upped the selection there to include a few light meals."

Even a cursory visit will take a full day (museum hours are a short 1000-1630)The amount of material presented is vast. The museum is filled with artifacts, any one of which would be the centerpiece at a typical museum. The Alexander Sarcophagus. The Kadesh Tablet. The Chain from the Golden Horn. The Anatolian sculpture display. The list goes on and on and on.And items are displayed in such an intimate fashion. There are few ropes and stanchions. The visitor has immediate and intimate access to artifacts that the Smithsonian or Louvre would display behind layers of security.The buildings themselves are a bit long in the tooth and could use an update. There are few areas to sit in the display galleries. But there are very comfortable rest areas with bathrooms at the end of each gallery. There aren't many docents or tour guides available, but there is an audio tour guide available.Access to the museum is through Gulhane Park and isn't very obviously marked. The walk from the tram stop is a pretty good stretch of the leg. On the good news side, across the street from the tram stop is a pseudo-English pub, The North Shield.

The main hall on the right (ground floor) has the best collection, especially the sarcophagi. The layout of the main hall is not intuitive - some of the best stuff is past a very winding path, easy to miss without a guidebook or detailed map. You can skip the top floor of the main halli if in a rush - there's not much there.The tile exhibit in the middle is only average. There are better samples of tile work in Topkapi Palace and various mosques. Skip it entirely if in a rush, or you can rush through it in about 5 minutes. The Oriental exhibit near the entrance is good, not great. Again, you can do an express tour of it in about 15 minutes if you had to.There's a free coat check, free clean W/C (squat-style toilets), a nice tree-lined outdoor cafe, and many nice park benches outside. I think the price was 15TL for everything.I wouldn't make this a priority for sightseeing, but well worth it on a longer tour of Istanbul or as a stop for bad weather. Right in Gulhane Park, the location is very convenient. One tip: the signs to the venue are sometimes hidden behind the huge tour buses parked by the arch way. Walk to your extreme right as you enter the park via the 3 arches, or you might miss it like I did and walk the entire park! Better still, ask a guard when you pass the arch.

The museum is in the grounds of Topkapi but accessed from a road leading from the gates to Gulhane Park. It is a 19th century neoclassical building with extension and some ongoing restoration. Also in the grounds are the Museum of the Ancient Orient with some interesting stone carvings from Mesopotamia and periods like the Hittites. There is also the charming Tiled Kiosk or pavilion which houses exhibits of wonderful Turkish pottery as well as the tiled walls and rooms that give the building it's name. The main museum of archeology houses rooms full of stunning finds from the necropolis at Sidon. The sarcophagi and mausoleum are immense, beautifully carved and remarkably well preserved. Elsewhere there are several exhibits on the various periods of Troy and it's excavations which seem to have been both good and less professional. The video presentation on Troy is excellent and informative. The main issue for us on a July day was the heat. There's no aircon and not even a fan. Also, direction signage is almost non-existent though most of the exhibits have adequate labels in Turkish and English. There is, as at many sites in Istanbul, an audio guide we did not use. I doubt if it would have guided us in and around and out again better than we managed and the labels were quite adequate. I am glad we went; I would not have wanted to miss it; but I do wish they'd consider better direction signage, more chairs/benches inside (there's plenty outside) and some fans. And it is cheap at 10TL."

This museum is actually a group of three museums in one ... the Archaeological Museum (which is packed with mostly Greek and Roman era discoveries), the Museum of the Ancient Orient (which contains similar ancient material from other Oriental cultures), and the Museum of Islamic Art (especially tiles, pottery and glassware) -- so you get a lot for your 10TL entry fee.The museum is located just downhill from Topkapi (the site was originally Topkapi's outer gardens and they're joined by a path) in the Sultanahmet - Eminonu district of Istanbul. It's easy to find, and easy to explore.I found the Museum of Oriental Art most fascinating. The exhibits come from all across the Middle East and are all well labelled and described ... from cult statues to codes of law to ceramic tiles featuring lions and mythological beasts - there's a lot to capture your mind here. It has, for instance, the Kadesh Peace Treaty -- said to be the oldest peace treaty in the world. I liked the Islamic Art too. The Archaeological Museum is vast and fascinating, and almost too big to take in during one visit. It contains monumental works like the Alexander Sarcophagus, said to have been made for Alex The Great. When you're tired of looking at all the treasures innside, there's a decent cafe in the grounds outside, set in a unique sculpture park containing dozens of stone objects ranging from memorials to altars to marble palm trees, to sarcophagi of Byzantine emperors. These came from excavations all over Turkey."

It comprises three different buildings, the first, as you enter, is a museum of the ancient Orient. The exhibits are not numerous but they are of outstanding quality. Different cultures are represented: Anatolican, Egyptian and Mesopotamian, including striking basalt lions from the 8th century BC Hittite period. The main building houses a collection that is just staggering in its beauty and extent. The objects are too numerous to mention, but look out in particular for the Hellenistic and Roman sculptures and most especially for the objects from the Royal Necropolis of Sidon. Here you can see wonderful sarcophogi of the like nowhere else in the world. The marble Alexander sarcophogus from 325 BC is one of the great treasures of archaeology, the equal of anything in the British Museum. It is massive but the carvings are exquisite in their detail and expressiveness: it will long linger in your memory. A third building is originally from 1472 and houses a fine collection of ceramics, in particular those from Iznik, which are one of Turkey's great artistic delights (for which you should visit Rustem Pasha mosque). Altogether, the whole museum is a gem: in spite of the large number of objects, the displays are spacious and well laid out so you do not feel overwhelmed. But be prepared to go back for another visit since there is really too much for one day. If you want a permament memento (photography without flash is permitted) buy the excellent book on the museum by Dr Pasinli, a former director, which has superb illustrations and a most informative text."

Don't miss any of the buildings and the outside courtyard, each area has amazing treasures tucked inside. The hall of Roman statues with more than two dozen, larger than life gods and goddesses was breathtaking. If you are into reading every plaque and listening to every audio tour comment, I suggest you plan for at least a three hour visit.The audio tour is well worth the price. However, the way the collection and the map in the floor plan are a bit difficult to follow. Also, the numbering for the audio tour doesn't follow the sequence of the floor plan, so it can be somewhat confusing at times. The Archaeology Museum is very much an adult museum. Few, if any exhibits are \"kid friendly,\" most all have plaques with lots to read. If you have young children with you, I'd suggest you save your money and skip this museum.Tip: Visit the Archaeology Museum in the afternoon after your morning visit to the Topkapi Palace (adjacent to the Archaeology Museum and with a separate entrance fee.) This way you will avoid the afternoon cruise ship crowds at the Topkapi Palace (cruise ship groups start arriving at mid-day.) The Archaeology Museum isn't on the cruise ship schedule so it won't be as overly as crowded either way."

When I saw preserved ancient statues on ground floor, first thing I realised was how the fashion these days, is repeatation of the ancient fashion! There is big section dedicated to Troy.But just before coming to Istanbul we got opportunity to see British archeological museum's Mesopotamia exhibit visiting Abu Dhabi, so we felt troy section similar.Of course, you get to see lot of ancient art to marvel at in this museum but already whole of Istanbul itself was a museum for us. The byzantine, roman, ottoman history found everywhere is already too much to grasp in short time and then adding whole of archeological museum in that may add on lot more confusion, this is definitely my confession.

I wouldn't miss the Museum complex which includes the Museum of the Ancient Near East and the Tiled Kiosk for the world, because The Near East Museum contains some of antiquity's most valuable artifacts. The Ottoman Empire was enormous in its day and stretched from Iran to Egypt - so in these museums you will find unsurpassed objects from many places. There are Sumerian statues, and I think the world's greatest collection of Sumerian clay writing tablets; the world's oldest love letter, the world's first peace treaty and the lions of Babylon which are so well preserved in their bright enamelled painting that I thought they were fakes the first time I saw them. Across the courtyard in the Archaeological museum proper there is a collection from Sidon that beggars belief - the Alexander sarcophagus, and many others fill an entire ground floor. It is absolutely astonishing. Upstairs the entire floors are dedicated to Trojan finds. then the painted kiosk has a few, but beautifully selected, works of ancient art. Wow. You would have to travel to the Met in New York, Berlin or the british Museum to find any museums to equal these."

The Archaeological Museum has of one of the most extraordinary collections of classical antiquities beautifully displayed with the information in English. There is so much to see and experience.One of the highlights of the museum is the Alexander Sarcophagus, called because this fantastic carved marble tomb depicts Alexander the Great winning a victory over the Persians. It is located in the Old building on the right side as you enter the courtyard. When you enter go to the left, it is a few galleries further. The museum of the Ancient Orient contains wonderful artifacts from Mesopotamia. The one that I was searching for was the Code of Hammurabi which dates from 1750 BC, this is the oldest recorded set of laws. However, I was astonished to find out that it was a very small piece of stone with writing, I almost missed it if I did not ask a guide where to find it. Also, included is the oldest standard measures, and various other early writings.Lastly there is large area completely devoted to Anatolia and Troy. One side gives the history of Anatolia the other side of the gallery shows the excavations of Troy. I think it might be a good idea to visit the museum first before going to Troy, you will have a better understanding.My suggestion, is try to book a guide that has a specialty in Archaeology for this museum it will be well worth the cost. I could have spent weeks in this museum if not more. Decide what you want to see first, make a plan and enjoy. There is too much to see in just one visit."

Sit on the terrace and sip your freshly made coffee with a cool glass of water and a sweet piece of Turkish Delight while looking at lizards dart around your feet, and the cats jump in and out of the huge jars in the grass.

This museum is hard to find hidden, between the Topkapi Palace - 500m opposite main Ticket Office ( which itself is well within the outer walls of the Palace), and the main road. It is huge and covers at least 3 buildings and gardens. It should be given a good half day for a reasonable viewing. I was refused the use of the lift in the main building. Disabled access would be difficult and if you are tired after a lot of walking avoid this site. My visit was outwith main tourist season but local children's parties were noisy and unattended."

The Museum is more of a complex of buildings that is a stone's throw away from Topkapi Palace and the two can be rolled into a single afternoon.Certainly reserve at least 3 hours to get a sense of the place; there's no way you're going to go slowly through the exhibits so it's useful to get a sense of what you absolutely must see; like the Discovery of Troy Exhibit, the sarcophagi, especially the so called 'Alexander the Great sarcophagus' and the Byzantine Istanbul Section. The labeling/description of the displays is a bit limited; not that you're going to read everything there is, but it could be more systematic, neater and engaging. The sheer volume of artifacts though certainly makes up for that. I wouldn't miss this on a trip to Istanbul, but I am a bit of a History / Archaeology buff, still my kids are pretty neutral (I think) and they seemed to get quite a lot out of it."

Museum of Oriental Arts is bigger and has good collection of Egiptian exhibits (Kadesh Treaty is must see obviously).Main building is huge with good collection but I can say two bad things about organization in general:1) main building has very bad navigation inside, you'll spend half an hour trying to find the way to \"new building\" even if you're considered as smart person; 2) the marks with numbers for audio-guided tours nearby the exhibits are very bad visible and it takes time to find them.

So we decided to just wonder around and when we arrived in front of the museum we were surprised to see no lines. Because of that we thought there wasn't much to see in the museum, but Oh my we sure had a very pleasant surprise. The Museum is fantastic! It houses an incredible amount of artifacts that are extremely interesting and can walk the visitor through the ages from Troy to the Ottoman Empire. The highlight is Alexander the Great's sarcophagus which is amazing, but there are countless other artifacts just as interesting if not so impressive.

This museum, housed in two main buildings, was a 19C construction designed to bring some Western-style culture and historical awareness to the Ottoman Empire of the time. The buildings are magnificent, very well laid-out, and the contents are just amazing. Tiled lions from the Ishtar Gate of Babylon, over 4,000 years old; cuneiform tablets, Egyptian sarcophagi and mummies, all the bits and bobs and gatherings from the Ottoman Empire's diplomatic service throughout the Middle East. It's all very well laid out and explained, and non-flash photography is permitted. There's also a beautiful building, a Tiled House, that is a superb example of Ottoman architecture. It's worth climbing the steps to view inside, and appreciate the skill and subtlety of the tile-makers of the time. The third and biggest building currently holds an exhibition on the history of Istanbul, from its earliest Neolithic traces through the various empires that have controlled this gateway between Asia and Europe. Again, the exhibits are well displayed, with excellent information plaques and a good layout. The museum displays contain enough information to please an informed amateur archaeologist, but even a casual tourist cannot fail to be impressed by the immense sweep and age-span of the collections."

The Museum displays 5000 years of fascinating history with well organized, engrossing exhibits. For example, we were amazed at the details of the \"Alexander Sarcophagus,\" which does NOT contain Alexander the Great, but which has remarkable battle scenes from ~300 BC. And we also thought that the Tiled Pavilion was well worth the time to see the evolution of Iznik tiles and other Turkish ceramics.By all means use an audio tour or a tour guide to enhance your experience."

In fact there are three museums: the Archeology Museum, the Ancient Orient Museum and the Islamic Arts Museum (Tiled Kiosk). Together, they have more than one million of objects in their collections, representing almost all ages and civilizations in the world history. It is located in the Topkapi Palace gardens and was founded in 1891, during the Ottoman Empire. The most important objects are:- Alexander Sarcophagus- Sarcophagus of the Crying Women- Sarcophagi of Tabnit and the Satrap- The Palmyran Tomb- Parts of the Ishtar Gate (Babylon)- Ancient statues from the Roman Era, from Aphrodisias, Ephesus and Miletus- Ephebos- Parts of statues from the Temple of Zeus (Bergama)- Treaty of Kadesh- A statue of a lion, from the Mausoleum of Maussollos- A snake's head from the Serpentine Column (Constantinopla Hippodrome)- 800,000 Ottoman coins, seals, decorations and medals- Artifacts from the early civilizations of Anatolia, Mesopotamia, Arabia and Egypt- Siloam inscription, found in a water tunnel from the Siloam Pools in Jerusalem. All three museums are so interesting, that I would recommend a whole day to see all collections. I spent only one afernoon there and it was not enough. The museum is very calm and peaceful, even in the touristic high season. There is also a cafe in the garden, among many antiquities and stone columns - very beautiful and expensive. I also recommend a visit to the museum website before actually going there, so you can plan which objects are most interesting to see if you have limited time: http://www.istanbularkeoloji.gov.tr/main_page"

And, am I so glad I did.Consisting of three museums, the Istanbul Archeology Museum is located before the Topkapi Palace and on the upper side of the beautiful Gulhane Park. It is one of the must-see sight in Istanbul, and I just foiund out about that!!! . It could consume half of your day or even a whole day to see this huge museum housing more than a million of artifacts representing various world civilizations --- or almost all THE civilizations. If that doesn't sound interesting enough, I don't know what. You really have to see it. Small stuff, huge stuff. Those huge sarcophagi -- intricately carved and intelligently designed, esp. the sarcophagus of Alexander - truly impressive. The amount of treasures displayed in 3 buildings is marvelous.A small coffee shop on the side or infront of the museum entrance overlooking the Gulhane Park down below, very expensive hot bev and croissants, but nice atmosphere, like sipping your coffee amidst the ruins.The museum building consist of the Archaeological Museum which is in the main building, the Museum of the Ancient Orient, and the Museum of Islamic Art in the Tiled Kiosk.Besides its importance as the \u201cfirst Turkish museum\u201d, it has an importance and specialty of being one of the museum buildings that are constructed as a Museum in the World. Today, it still protects its outstanding place in the World\u2019s biggest museums with its displays of more than a million belonging to various cultures.Entry Fee = TL10 only -------- which for me is more value than the separate entry fee for the harem part of the Topkapi Palace. Save that for this one."

The tea garden outside was closed for the winter season. Bathrooms are down near the Troy exhibition.The admission fee is a very reasonable 10 TL and worth every lira!Unlike the other museums in Istanbul that had huge crowds, here the halls, rooms and gardens were virtually empty in comparison.This allowed us to meander in and around the exhibitions with ease and as photography is allowed (no flash), we were able to bring home lots of memories. Most of the different displays were spread into three buildings, which are the Archaeological, Ancient Orient and Islamic Art (enameled tile Kiosk).Among the most memorable treasures here were: -Main Building:Alexander Sarcophagus, the gallery of statues (several rooms), sarcophagus of the Crying Women, Busts of Alexander, Zeus with many more old age funerary tombs.Ancient Orient:Tablet archives, Arabic, Mesopotamian, Egyptian and Anatolian art displaysKiosk:The building itself is beautiful with external mosaic tiling, lovely inside architecture, ceramic - chinaware objects and art spread over several rooms.This was a remarkable museum with a superb collection of artifacts.

This complex of museum, where more than 1 millions artefacts are exhibited, has been granted many museum awards from all over the world. Its large courtyard serves as a classical music concert hall in summer, which is a great experience as well. Surprisingly, it's very calm when compared with other touristic destinations of Istanbul and in good wheather, its serene courtyard can be a great choice to grab a sandwich and a drink for a short outdoor lunch. Its small and cosy coffee shop is also good. There are a lot of artefacts that are not displayed and throughout the year, as new pavillions are readied, new parts are opened. So, the museum can be visited more than once as there will always be a new section. For instance, the artefacts of the newly discovered Istanbul harbour area have started to be displayed recently. There is also a section for children. Don't miss this museum once in Istanbul"

The relics of ages past and civilizations that existed in the area of modern Turkey are well represented. The Sidon sarcophagi are particularly impressive as are the displays on the classical world. The wing added in the 70's is an architectural disappointment and unworthy of the artifacts it houses... the displays too need to be updated in the sense of making them better appreciable. The display on Troy needs work as do the ones on the Byzantine period... a bit disappointing... amazing objects but put out for viewing in a very lackluster way. Nonetheless the museum and the gardens around, with many columns, statues and the tombs of emperors no less are a very import place to visit if in Istanbul. When I return, I will definitely visit again and spend even more time in the museum. Photos were allowed, which was good and the toilets were acceptable."

I had never thought in my life I would ever fall in love with an archaeology museum... :D I even consider this place as one of the best tourist spots in Istanbul, along with Hagia Sophia.I only planned 2 hours to look around but instead I spent almost 6 hours taking pictures and enjoying the moments I had never felt anywhere else. If you don't enjoy taking pictures as much as I do, I would recommend to allocate at least a 3 hours in your schedule to visit this museum. And if you want to, there is also records that visitors can borrow to listen to. I did not borrow it because I was not into the history, instead I was so cought up in how beautiful the pieces are. My favourite part of the collections are the marble statues and (especially) marble sarcophagi. The Alexander's sarcophagus is breathtakingly beautiful... (I also never imagined I would like a sarcophagus, OMG) :)I aggree with the previous reviewers that this museum is so much better than the Topkapi. The collections are not limited to archaeological findings inside Turkey but also from the neighbouring countries. I highly recommend this museum to Istanbul Travellers. Don't forget to wear comfortable shoes. The admission fee is 10 Liras if I am not mistaken. So cheap compared to the beauty we all can see inside.

If you have any knowledge of ancient portraiture you will instantly recognise old faces. Marcus Aurelius jumped out at me, and there is a magnificent full size bronze of Hadrian. Late antique Byzantine statuary is fascinating too. I challenge even the most disinterested of people not be be astonished.

The legendary commander, who died at the age of 33, has never been forgotten during the twenty-three centuries passed since then, thanks to his glorious and great conquests during a short period of kingdom. He overthrew the Persian Empire and established a great empire extending from Macedonia to India. The cities founded by Alexander, who spent most of his life in Asia, as military bases turned into cultural and commercial centers later and played an important role in the spread of the Ancient Greek culture up to India. The era of Alexander the Great, of which artistic influences can be followed as well, was a transition period between the periods of Classical Art and Hellenistic Art. The Head of Alexander the Great, dated to the 2nd century BC, was found during excavations at the Lower Agora in Pergamon (Bergama). His head is inclined towards his shoulder, the lock of hair from the front of his head, slightly pulled back, resembles a lion's mane and his hair is irregularly waved in both sides. This is the hairstyle of Alexander the Great. All of the aspects such as his heavy eyelids and round eyes, thick eyelashes, slightly open mouth that does not show his teeth are characteristics of the statues of Alexander the Great. This is the style of portraits made by the sculptor Lysippos, who lived in the 4th century BC and led the transition between the Classic Art and the Hellenistic Art. The artist worked for Alexander the Great and he was the only sculptor of Alexander. The deep forehead lines call the big problems faced by the king despite his youth to the mind. This work is reflecting the typical characteristics of the Pergamon sculpture school during the era of King Eumenes II.  The Statue of Marsyas, dated to the Hellenistic period, was found in Tarsus, a historical city in south-central Turkey. He is depicted as hung from a tree and his muscles stretched due to torture draw attention. So to say, he has a physically silent but angry expression. The original version of this special statue should have been placed to the center of a group of statues including the statue of Apollo sitting on his left side and a slave sharpening his knife in order to skin him on his right side. Marsyas, the main character of an Anatolian story, is depicted while bearing the consequences of his rivalry with Apollo, the god of music. According to the story, Marsyas claims that he plays his flute better than Apollo plays his lyre. Neither of them wins in a musical contest, but Apollo asks Marsyas to turn his instrument upside down and to add his own voice. However, Marsyas cannot meet this challenge and Apollo wins the contest. Angry because of being challenged by a mortal, Apollo skins Marsyas alive and hangs his skin to a pine tree. However, he feels sorry later, breaks his lyre and turns Marsyas into a river. Ephepos statue is the statue of an ephebos, i.e. a male teenager. Probably he is an athlete and after a heavy exercise, he rests against a long, rectangular column, which once had a relief or herm. He should have just finished his exercise, since he wears a mantle-like cloth for protection. His small and round head is the most component of the statue. Eyelashes are apparent, eyes are big and the lips are slightly open. It is one of the unique ancient artifacts found until today. Probably, it was used to decorate a gymnasium. It is an important example, since it shows that not only gods, goddesses and emperors, but also ordinary people who were important for the society were portrayed in the ancient era."

Room after room of astonishing exhibits, including the Alexander tomb, which I sat and gawped at for nearly an hour.The signs are really informative and interesting, bringing to life the complex and fascinating history of the areas which used to be part of the Empire.If you go to Istanbul and don't spend an afternoon here, you're mad."

I didn't have particularly high expectations, but found it absolutely brilliant. It's good value compared to other tourist attractions, just 10 lira entry charge.On the ground floor of the main section is an impressive collection of sarcophaguses (sarcophagi?) - massive tombs with intricate carvings on the sides, including the famous 'Alexander sarcophagus', which supposedly shows Alexander the Great in battle. There is also a sequence of rooms with statues from various periods. Really I felt the collection was better than at the British Museum in London (which I've visited quite often), particularly in view of the lack of crowds. You can get right up close to all the exhibits.Upstairs there is a massive (really massive) collection of finds from Anatolia, Troy and most of the Middle-East, going right back to 4000BC. Far too much to take in - case after case of ceramics and jewellery in remarkable condition. You could spend all day there and not see everything. It was completely deserted apart from the security guards, which was a shame.There is also a decent cafe and gift shop."

Especially if you have a knowledge of the Old Testament, you'll all kinds of things from the kings who menaced the Israelites - Sargon! Tiglath-Pilesar! Highlights include the inscription of Hezikiah's tunnel in Jerusalem and the Kadesh Treaty. I was especially suprised by how kindly they treated Schliemann, the one who first unearthed ancient Troy, in one of the exhibits. He stole many of the artifacts from the Turkish people, and was rather distructive in his digging methods, but they give him a great deal of credit for his discovery and work."
