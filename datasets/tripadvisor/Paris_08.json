For us this was strictly a target of opportunity in that we were walking by, saw that there was no line, and decided to pop in. It is very poorly maintained. For example, on the stone ledges below each of the stained glass windows there had to be at least an inch of dirt and dust. You could use a small shovel to clean much of the filth away.If you do feel compelled to go here, do your homework as to what time of day the sun will have the most favorable exposure. It is necessary for the sun to back-light the windows in order to see what the original builders were trying to accomplish."

This is my favorite church/cathedral that I have been to in Europe, surpassing Notre Dame, St. Peter's (Rome), the duomo in Florence, and La Sagrada Familia (Barcelona). The size of the stained glass and the colors that come through when the sun is shining is incredibly impressive. It is much smaller and more intimate in my opinion than most other churches/cathedrals. This is a \"must-do\" if you are in Paris. Plus, it is a very short walk from Notre Dame, so it makes it easy to knock out both in a morning or afternoon. However, the lines can get very long, so plan ahead. Probably best to go early in the morning."

There are charts available near entrance that explain the various windows, if you want to do it yourself, and audio tour sets available. Groups were being led by guides as well.

In order to enter, you must wait in a security line and go through a metal detector. No food or glass containers can be brought in (just like at the airport, things like that are confiscated). Lines can be long, but luckily there was nearly no one in line when we went. The exterior of Sainte-Chapelle is basic and functional. The lower level has great architecture and color. It also has a gift shop area. The top level with wall-to-wall stained glass towering over you from every direction is amazing! We stared in awe for a long time.

It is just a few blocks from Notre Dame Cathedral and almost hidden by the Court a House Building that was built around it. Facing the Court House look to the left for the small sign for Sainte Chapelle. Go through the security for the Court a House and find the chapel standing on the inside courtyard. You can buy your tickets at the little ticket office---about 10 euros, I think.The upstairs chapel is stunning. Just stand, or sit, if you are lucky to find a seat, and just gaze up at the beauty! It is gorgeous!!! Make sure to go out to the little balcony, which once connected the chapel to the King's residence, and look back through the door---then enter the chapel through this door---to get the full impact of entering the chapel the way the King did. It is an incredible view!Also, watch the video of the recent restoration / cleaning of the glass panels. It is interesting. A few other interesting facts are 1). The stained-glass panels are all original, 2). The stained-glass panels have been removed only two times---once for the recent restoration and during WWII they were removed, labeled, and moved to a chateau in the south of France and hidden to keep them out of the hands oh Hilter. When the war was over, the panels were returned and placed in their proper places. I applauded the French people for saving such a masterpiece! Well Done!!?"

Try to be there before opening time so that the crowd is still manageable in the Chapel. Otherwise it is a bit of 'a nightmare'.

The initial WOW moment when you first walk up the stairs into the chapel is pretty awesome. Also, as a side note - it could be helpful to bring a pair of binoculars. That may sound a little ridiculous for such a small chapel, but there is SO much detail in the stained glass and much of it is too far up to see well. Or even if you aren't worried about seeing the stained glass in detail, the overall effect is still stunning."

Be prepared for going through a metal detector before entering. Take note of the time when visiting. When we were there, we arrived right at the end of their hour lunch. Some people had been waiting for over an hour to enter since it was closed for the lunch hour. I have been to the Vatican, St Pauls, Saint Mark's Basilica, Notre Dame, Duomo and, although its smaller, I feel this is the most beautiful of them all."

This church is located near Notre Dame so you can easily do both at the same time. The queue outside looked quite long, but then I realised that the entrance is shared between the Chapel and another attraction (i think it was the Palace of Justice - maybe) The chapel queue is to the right when facing the building (not to the left which was the other one where lots of people were standing) Once i figured this out, I walked straight in and to the chapel entrance , bought a ticket there (about a five minute wait) and then in I went. The downstairs section is interesting but if you find the spiral staircases at the back and head up to the chapel's second floor - wow!! The 360 degrees of leadlight windows depicting various bible scenes is truly amazing. If you can, make sure its a sunny day as this accentuates the effect of the windows. It is one of those breathtaking moments where you see something unlike you have ever seen before. This is one of those slightly less obvious touristy things that Paris has to offer that are truly worth it. Check out the description of how the windows wee made and also how they were restored. Very interesting."

From the moment one enters, it presents one with a reverence and an appreciation of the entire Biblical story told in stained glass. I can hardly imagine the work that goes into keeping each section of glass cleaned and dirt-free. The tiles on the ancient floor are incredible considering they are hundreds of years old. Be sure to visit the chapel up a long and winding narrow stairway to view the spectacular depiction of the Bible told in frames of beautiful coloured glass. This is a must see if you are in Paris."

Granted the entry cost of 10\u20ac per person is a little steep but I would say well worth it. Initially I was disappointed as you enter a long \"cave\" like room which is beautifully painted and very peaceful but not 10\u20ac. Then we went upstairs, it took our breath away. There are no words to describe the beauty of this place and it is worth a visit. My partner and I are in no way religious but it was lovely to sit out on the balcony and look into a room filled with brilliant, colourful light. It was calming and inspiring and a million miles away from the hustle and bustle of Paris (although it is close to the Lourve and a stones throw from Notre Dame). Downside: It is not wheelchair or pram friendly and there are no facilities. I am sure you would be able to leave your pram with security and the steps aren't too difficult to negotiate (I have a dodgy hip and I managed them). Top tip: go on a sunny day to get the full effect of the windows!"

The chapel took seven years to construct to house relics of Christ's Crucifixion. Circa 1248 Gothic architecture. The stained glass is the star here. The oldest stained glass windows in Paris. Enter the narrow staircase to the upper chapel to view the walls of stained glass. Each one depicts a different story of the old & new testaments.There are large descriptor tablets next to the stairs which explains each panel in detail in multiple languages, The large rose window above the doors is absolutely breathtaking. Certain evenings concerts are held in the chapel."

The Chapelle remains closed from 1-2:30 pm, so you can drop by here after lunch. The entry for Saint Chapelle and Concierge together is 15\u20ac. The Chapelle is drop dead gorgeous.

There are cheaper seats at \u20ac16-\u20ac25 and in such a (relatively) small chapel where you are surrounded by such beauty wherever you sit, any priced seat would give a similar experience. If you want to see the stunning La Sainte Chapelle with its intricate stained glasses do consider seeing it during one of these concerts for not much more than the entry price during the day.

It is a lovely old painted medieval chapel. The visitor then walks up a small winding staircase to the upper chapel, and the first time (nearly 30 years ago) I saw the upper chapel, my breath was taken away. The upper chapel is more 'glass than wall'. Blue stained glass windows soar to the ceiling. It is relatively small space, and it is a place to simply sit and absorb its beauty. The only problem is, despite signs asking for quiet, many visitors cannot refrain from loud chatter. Despite this it is a beautiful experience. The second time I was in Paris, my husband and I were also able to attend a concert of baroque music in the chapel. Unlike the day visits we entered the chapel through its large doors from the Palais De Justice. It has been a long time since I visited Paris (well before October 2015 - I had to pick a date), but the Sainte Chappelle is somewhere I would recommend to anyone."

At a stirring moment, a shaft of evening lights came through one of the stained glass windows like a spot light on the lead violinist standing at the alter and te colours danced on the floor. What a magical moment in a space that someone called a petit jewell box. This picture does not do the colours justice.The drop down box for dates did not allow me to choose the correct one so I indicated it in my review."

The first floor of the chapel is a great example of the picturesque setting of the early middle ages with decorations, coloring, and some examples of heraldry with the columns and arches to amaze. The second floor, going up a narrow winding stairway in the front opened into a room with the most amazing stained glass. Most definitely worth the visit. Good thing a brought along a (very) wide angle lens, captured quite a bit, but still not enough to get more than a couple of panels. Its a quick visit in the chapel adjacent to the palace of justice, and walking up to it saw the advocates in black garb and white bibs on the stairway talking the air (to some mostly). The entire experience was just great and a great adjunct to a visit of the Notre Dame Cathedral. Best on a sunny day to get the best effect of the stained glass."

Eventually we figured it out but there isn't really anything inside that tells you about the place. The stain glass is beautiful and tells a story of how Christianity began and there are two floors of these beautiful glass artworks. Maybe stain glass really isn't our thing but overall the place was beautiful but not really worth the price."

I visited 3 years ago now, and it is still 1 of my favourite places in our 3 week Europe holiday.Make sure you head upstairs, because if you think the bottom floor as you enter is beautiful, the stained glass windows upstairs will take your breath away! Unfortunately for me, large parts of the windows were undergoing restoration when I visited but I believe those works are complete and I would love to visit again in the future."

It costs 10 euros to enter and it is very small with a gift shop and information on the first floor. You climb a spiral staircase to the second floor and you are greeted by walls of stained glass everywhere you look. Words cannot really describe the beauty and I recommend you see it for yourself if in Paris. It's much less crowded than the Notre Dame (though the Notre Dame is definitely worth seeing as well), and it has a more intimate and calm feel."

Then we mounted the spiral stairs . . . We forgot about that ground floor, as we saw the stained glass soaring upwards all around us. There were too many people, but they seemed insignificant in that space. We retreated for a while to a terrace at one end, and amused ourselves trying (not with total success) to interpret the scenes beautifully carved on the monumental doorway. Then back to the glorious interior for a last \"fix\" before returning to the busy real world of the flower market and Notre Dame."

Stain glass windows from floor to ceiling all the way around the church make for spectacular photos. Absolute must while in Paris.I recommend going on a sunny day to get the full beauty of the church, also you should out of respect cover your shoulders and knees whilst in the church.

Saint-Chapelle is an interesting historical site, and the interior sights that are open to the public are gorgeous and in large part, newly-restored to be more visible (removal of pollution and dirt etc from the centuries of exposure). It is essentially now two large rooms open to the public, and the remainder of the building has been taken over by the Police - still somewhat visible externally, but inaccessible for touring as a member of the public. The stained glass windows on the second floor of the building are particularly stunning, and show several books of the bible in order, however the stairs to ascend are steep and somewhat uneven for anyone who is unsteady on their feet - not sure of alternative access options. There is a mural on the wall near the altar downstairs which is from the 12th or 13th century - stunning again in its longevity and clarity. There is also a fascinating interactive media simulation of what the original Saint-Chapelle looked like, complete with its various functions that was fun to go through, but as a single machine that could be operated by one person at a time, it took a long time to go through its entirety and was not really conducive to a venue like that - as an online invitation or an educational supplement for school children, it would be really great."

The stained glass windows inside the king's chapel are perhaps one of the most beautiful things I have ever seen. Do not overlook this spot if you are in Paris. Like all of the top attractions (The Eiffel Tower, Notre Dame, The Louvre, The Musee D'Orsay, Etc) this should absolutely be on the top of your list.

This astonishingly beautiful church right near Notre Dame is a little bit hidden and not quite as frequently visited as its big sister down the street but anyone who is interested in stained glass should make Sainte-Chapelle a top priority. My husband and I went late in the day and didn't find crowds but only had half an hour to visit before they closed. If I were to go back, I'd go first thing in the morning and get either an audio guide or take a tour. Better yet, I'd look to see if there were any night time music performances in the space as that would be an amazing way to experience it. One thing that is probably obvious but bears repeating: there are two spaces here, one that you see when you walk in and another that's up a windy flight of stairs. The bottom one is worth visiting but it's the top where you'll find stained glass that just soars into the heavens."

You appear to be in just a single room with no way out other than the way you came in.

Beneath the main chapel is a smaller, but still quite impressive, chapel that was built for the ordinary folks who worked/lived in the royal residence.

We got a joint ticket with The Conciergerie which was actually free for my daughter as she is under 26 and an EU resident.There was no queue to get in and i wish that i had spent more time there-we didn't go upstairs. The only problem for me was that there were a lot of people talking loudly despite signs and someone shushing them, so there was little time for peaceful reflection. The chapel itself is so beautiful that i would love to go back if ever in Paris again."

It was worth visiting, although it's not the first place one would think of when visiting Paris. This is for someone who has already seen Paris and wishes to see more than the usual spots. The magnificent stained glass windows are located upstairs. At first sight I did not really appreciate the panels. due to an overcast sky. I took some photos. But when the sun's rays shone through, it was magically breathtaking. The colors shone gloriously. I took a whole new set of pictures. It was used as the French king's chapel many centuries ago, but now it's no longer in use. The only drawback - just like many old buildings in Europe, the musty odor would give me nasal allergies. It's a nice quiet place where one cannot help but feel reverently peaceful. Many tourists were there too, but all of them were basking very quietly. I also enjoyed passing by the court house, seeing the judges go about their business in their gowns. (I am naturally curious about ordinary Parisian life). A great experience. Expect long queues outside and inside the compound."

But the second floor, which you access by walking up an 800 year old spiral, stone staircase (not great for those that are clostrophobic) to the most amazing displays of stained glass I've ever seen, much more impressive than Notre Dame.

Seeing my professor's PowerPoint presentation of the stained glass windows made me even more interested in history, especially through art and architecture. Therefore, visiting this chapel was extremely exciting for me and I highly recommend a brief stop here when visiting Paris. The museum pass includes Sainte-Chapelle and the neighboring Conciergerie, and Notre Dame is just up the street so I planned to do all three in the same day, which was extremely manageable. This chapel is a beautiful example of gothic architecture and was built to house the King's relics from the Passion including the Crown of Thorns. A visit takes less than an hour and it's location near other significant attractions makes it a perfect stop on your route."

After paying to get into the church we weren't too keen to pay for the audio guide. Sadly, I really wish we had. Once we were finished in the church my husband found a plaque full of descriptions for the stained glass (it is to the right of the open doors - try to find this it is very helpful!).We knew the windows told the stories from the books of the bible but again I wanted more info. We finally figured out that the story of Jesus crucifixion was behind the large altar at the end of the church. This was disappointing because the altar was placed in such a way that we couldn't see this art work.If you decide to go, which I do recommend, get the audio guide and I also recommend you arrive early. We got there 10 min before it opened and there was already a line up. You have to go thru extra security because the church is surrounded by the Palais de Justice."

Stained-glass, of course, is always pretty to look at - but the way it's done in Sainte-Chappelle, takes it to a whole other level, almost ethereal.

You'll be among a handful of people and can appreciate the space as royalty did - plus you get to see the rose window at its best, with the sun setting behind it. There is an audio tour as well as helpful flyer to describe the windows and the layout of the chapel.

We were there during the evening and had the opportunity to experience the sun setting through this amazing collection of stained glass windows. The room itself is small, by cathedral standards, which is really a blessing as it allows you to take your time to concentrate on select portions of the room. An absolute must for anyone visiting Paris; close to Notre Dame and, maybe, even worth the time instead-if your pressed for time."

Walls of stained glass--all restored in the last few years--soar to a vaulted ceiling of blue and gilt, each window of different shapes and panes telling various holy stories. We went in the late afternoon and the windows glowed. On the west end is a rose window, and doors used by the king to enter the chapel. Tours seemed to be offered only in French, but there are laminated boards in various languages that help explain the history and restoration process. My favorite historical place in Paris, period."

Almost every time we visit Paris we stop in at Saint Chapelle to enjoy its beauty and inspiration. Almost in one view the whole of its meaning and representation can be imagined. I appreciate its size and sparkle, it's splendor and preciousness, its history and timelessness. In the summers concerts are scheduled each evening for good value and a chance to sit quietly and take in the marvel of this building while listening to the sounds of Bach or Vivaldi or Beethoven."

The Sainte-Chapelle was built to house holy relics - Christ's crown of thorns and pieces of the true cross - which cost more than the chapel itself cost to build. The light cast by the stained glass windows is the highlight, and to experience it at its best, join the line at least 30 minutes before opening time so that this tiny chapel is not crowded when you get in there. Head straight upstairs via the tiny spiral staircase and prepare to be entranced. Don't forget to look down at the floor tiles, either. You will see why."

I had visited Paris 5 times before I finally managed to visit the Sainte-Chapelle and I am so glad I did on this trip. It is amazing! The stain glass windows are like nothing you have seen before - so I absolutely recommend this church as a place that you spend the time to visit. Arrive early to be ready to wait in a long line but it is worth it. If it is raining make sure you take a umbrella or rain jacket as when waiting in the line to get in their is no cover or places to sit and stay dry - trust me on this point as I got wet..."

Walls of color and light pour into the senses, and I just sat on one of the gothic benches, almost in a meditative state.If you opt for one of the concerts, you will find the acoustics perfect, and again, what better atmosphere for the lover of classical music.Historically the chapel is fascinating as well, when you realise the windows have survived upheaval, power struggle, revolution, monarchy and republic, world wars, spanning 700 years.The Saint Chappell is a MUST-see for any aesthete or lover of history."

Most incredible place to visit and well worth it. Learn the history of the man who built it so you understand the story on the glass."

But, if you have to stand in line to go inside, rather walk over to Ste. Chapelle and stand in line there (or buy your timed ticket ahead of time). For a Jewish girl from NYC, this is the only place that could convert me to Christianity! I guarantee you will be in awe of the walls of stained glass windows. The tiled floor, the bas relief, the sculptures are all jaw dropping. It's a small-ish space at the top of a stone spiral staircase. Go!"

This is my third trip to the city, and Sainte Chapelle is the sight above all others. My college aged son was mesmerized by the stained glass. Each window tells a story, much of it familiar and you can find lots of vignettes you will recognize. There is no way to prepare you for the glory of colors that shine through every direction. Take your time, take a camera, spend an hour and look for Noah, Adam and Eve, and other stories throughout. If you see one thing in Paris, make it this. If you see two or three, make this one of them!"

All the walls are filled with beautifully detailed windows, bathing the whole chapel in purple light. It is the perfect attraction to visit after the Notre Dame."

The entrance to the Royal Palais is on the other side of the arch. You go through security and then proceed past the outside of the chapel to your right. You will enter a line to buy tickets, then proceed into the lower level of the chapel. After touring this room proceed up the stairs to the main chapel. We visited on a cloudy day and can only imagine what it would be like on a sunny day. Amazing anyway, but I am sure it is even better with much more sun. We purchased a combination ticket with the Conciergerie which was also a nice place to visit."

All the stained glasses were very small if you have been to most of the churches, cathedrals, and chapels in Italy. On the next day we visited Montmatre's Sacre Coeur it was free and had a lot more stained glass windows to see. If you only have time to go to one of these two sites, I strongly recommend you to chose Montmartre over Saint Chappelle."

I managed to get a reduced fee being under 25 so remember to bring your ID with you to benefit from that. You first enter into the lower chapel, where there isn't that much to see, you then take the stairway to the main attraction which is the stain glass windows. Beautiful windows, but that's all there is to see. If it's a busy day, there's also nowhere to sit in the chapel which was difficult, especially after a full day of sight-seeing."

Buy the tickets on line in advance. That way you do not need to stand in line for an hour or two while waiting to buy a ticket. Second, there is a tight security here since the church in in the courtyard of the Justice Ministry, the French version of the US Department of Justice in Washington DC. They are efficient but they are serious. No metal in your pockets and no sharp pointy objects. Finally if you go in the morning from around 9 am to 14:00, there will be large crowds of people in the place. All the tour buses will be there and the big tour groups will be all surrounding their tour leader who will be lecturing in one of a number of different languages. If you are not there as soon as they open, then go around 14:00. Far fewer people. In fact go to the Concierge first in the morning and then go here. That is the reverse order and a lot of the bus tours seem to make it optional."

Plenty of information to read and follow along to get the experience. When we were leaving, we saw a flyer for an evening concert(Vivaldi and Bach). We came back in the evening and simply incredible!!!! We got front row seats and it was one of the nicest concerts I've ever been to.

But there is a small doorway to the side of the entryway which has a very narrow, winding staircase to the second floor. As you step out of the staircase and into the room you will experience a jaw dropping moment! The high stained glass 'walls' are breathtaking! There are 15 stained glass windows with 1,113 scenes, each telling part of the story of mankind (read them left to right, bottom towards top). I would highly recommend going to their website and printing a copy of the booklet (Go to Prepare for your visit) as it explains the layout of the upper chapel. I did not see any while I was there.

I visited Sainte-Chapelle on a particularly grey day in February... and still regret the visit. It's not that I don't like stained glass or gothic buildings... I just felt it was too small and not private at all. Compared to the Louvre, which was fairly empty when I visited it, Sainte Chapelle felt like an overcrowded market. And not just for taking photos... one could not stand and admire the art/decor for too long because people kept pushing in. Overall, I found it too expensive and not satisfying at all."

On the lle de la Cite, Sainte-Chapelle somewhat understandably plays second fiddle to Notre Dame, but in a smaller way, is no less spectacular.That said, it is well worth the 10Euros entry fee, so wander around the ground floor chapel before ascending a steep, spiral staircase to the renovated main chapel with its stunning stained glass windows.Entering the room, just about everyone goes \"wow\" at the first sight of these huge colourful and spectacular windows.The chapel dates from the mid 1200s and time had taken its toll on the glass, but a combination of private investment by Velux and a grant from the EU has seen a ten million Euro project of restoration and boy, what a job they've done.A video shows the work carried out in restoring the magnificent glasswork and if you have time, there is a narrative to take in about the messages conveyed in the glasswork."

We were in Paris in 2012 for the first time, visited this old church with no preparation or expectations (a friend of our daughter-in-law's told us we HAD to see it). We were stunned -- and that with more than 1/3 of the stained glass windows under repair. We returned to Paris this year and Sainte-Chapelle was an absolute must-see so we could see all the windows. Even on a cold rainy day, it was again amazing. The entire Bible is \"told\" in the stained glass windows. We probably stayed 20 minutes and would have stayed longer had we not been chased out for the lunch break. Yes, they shut it completely down from 1 pm to 2:15 pm for lunch. I recommend the All Museum pass generally and it covers this. However, there is no preferential entry here for the pass and the line can be long (it took us about 1/2 hour waiting in line). It is worth the wait. Really. And pictures simply can't capture the experience of actually being there. Don't miss this."

Some reviews noted that the evening light was magical during the evening concerts, but please note that the audience faces East and the most enchanting Western light will be on entering from the \"rose window\" behind the audience in the evening. Unfortunately, the comcert we atended (VIP seats 2nd row, center, Bach performance on 18 June '16) paled in comparison with the venue, especially considering the roughly $50 USD (40 Euro) per ticket cost of the seats. We knew in advance that the acoustics of the Chapel would be challenging. After all, what can be expected of a 13th century building? Yet, for the price, one would expect far higher quality musicianship (2 violin, 1 viola, 1 cello, 1 bass and harpsichord). Although the concert provided great opportunities to enjoy the stunning stained glass, I would not recommend the VIP seats to be closer to the musicians. My classically trained, former-cellist wife likened the performance to a school talent show, especially because the children's chorus was not of the highest caliber, but also due to less than ideal acoustics of the space and sub-par performances by the \"pro\" musicians accompanying the chorus. The kids tried hard though anf I was a little less crtical. Was it horrible? No. Was it what you expect for 40+ Euros (an investment that buys decent seats at any European symphony, such as Amsterdam's' magnificent Concertgebouw)? No way, no how. If you are not a music snob and do not need the VIP seats, perhaps it is worth it at 30 Euros per seat, especially considering what 30 Euros of entertainment buys in downtown Paris in the evening. If you are accustomed to first-rate classical performances, be prepared for disappointment. Either way, it is a stunning space despite the organizers chasing us out immediately after the performance."

All the Paris attractions search bags and many have metal detectors, but this one was adjusted to be extremely sensitive. More than the airport or any other checkpoint, this one would alarm if you had a ring or tiniest piece of metal. The guard kept telling everyone to go back and look for more metal on your person. Anyway, outside and beyond is the Church entrance line and periodically someone would ask for Museum Pass holders to come to the front. It was very crowded, but since you are looking upward it was easy to see the stained glass."

            "review": "Speechless When Entered the Upper Chapel. Sainte-Chapelle (\u8056\u79ae\u62dc\u5802, Holy Chapel) is a royal chapel on the Ile de la Cite (\u897f\u5824\u5cf6) in the fourth arrondissement of Paris, France. The Gothic styled chapel was the residence of the Kings of France until the 14th century. The Sainte-Chapelle was built from 1242 to 1248 in accordance of the wishes of King Louis IX to house the relics of the Passion of Christ. The Crown of Thorns (\u834a\u68d8\u51a0) is the most famous among these relics. Today, it is preserved in Notre Dame de Paris (\u5df4\u9ece\u8056\u6bcd\u9662). The recent restoration of the chapel began in 2008 and was completed in 2014 (the 800th anniversary of the birth of St. Louis). The restoration included the western rose window (consisted of cleaning the glass, the leading, and the metal structures of the windows) and the facades of the building and sculptures.We went there around 4 pm and found it is located within the walls of the Palais de Justice and that all visitors must go through an enforced police check. Once we went inside the Sainte Chapelle, we entered the lower chapel where the statue of Virgin Mary welcomed us. The lower chapel was originally the place of worship for the palace staff. The Statue of Louis IX in the far end center is the highlight of the lower chapel. The decor is amazing and allows visitors to imagine the area like when it was in the Middle Ages. The basilica styled layout with the semi-circular apse was simple and did not have many stained glasses because it was in the base of the chapel. The most extraordinary part of the chapel was the upper chapel. It was used only for the king, his close friends, and family. We were speechless when entered the upper chapel because it is almost covered by stained glass. We have never seen any other church like this with so many stained glasses. There are fifteen 13th century stained glass windows in the upper chapel, a treasure of the art of stained glass which made the Sainte-Chapelle so popular. Those 15 m (49.2 ft) stained glass windows fill the nave and apse and describe 1,113 scenes from the Old and New Testaments, recounting the history of the world until the arrival of the relics in Paris. When the lights came through the colorful stained glass windows, we felt peace and harmony. Besides the amazing windows, the statue of Saint Peter (total 12 larger-than-life-sized sculpted stone figures representing the 12 Apostles), the great shrine and the large rose window that dominates the western wall are worth spending your time to enjoy. We were lucky to visit Sainte-Chapelle after they completed the latest restoration in 2014.When we visited Sainte-Chapelle in last April (2016), we saw French military with machine guns patrolling near Sainte-Chapelle and Notre Dame de Paris. It reminded us to be sensitive to any unexpected situation and prepare ourselves to do the proper thing if it happens. It was the 3rd day we were in Paris and later we found the Parisian did not show any tense atmosphere. The full price is 10\u20ac for adults. Paris Museum Passes are accepted, but there is no express gate in Sainte-Chapelle. I recommend everyone who comes to Paris should include this amazing chapel on their itinerary."

It's located next to La Conciergerie. This chapel doesn't look like much from the outside, but the second floor is surrounded by a massive amount of breathtaking stained glass."

When my wife and stepped into the chapel and saw the stained glass for the first time, we just stood in wonder and stared watching the light radiate through the stunning windows. Looking closer, you realize that each pane is a work of art telling a story.We loved St Chapelle so much that we arranged to come back for a Sunday evening Vivaldi concert. The music was beautiful and given the subtle acoustics, the beautiful chapel and the steadily changing light filtering through the windows provided the perfect backdrop. A magical experience!"

The security line shuts down i believe between 12-1:30. We went through about 11:30, which may have made the chapel less crowded, as less people as we stayed longer. Security/bag check is through a state building, so chapel still open once you clear through security. Just mentioning as some state can be very crowded and we did not have that experience. If i had had time i would have gone back, we were there on a rainy day, would love to see on a sunny day too. Look for laminated cards that explain what you are seeing. We did not do the audio tour, though i would have liked to."

This one stands out for the most stunning stained glass art I've ever seen. It is fantastic. However, there is not much to see here beyond that. My husband and I purchased tickets for a classical music concert and that was definitely the way to go. For about 20 euro you can sit back and enjoy the beauty of the church with lovely music playing. The musicians were rather good and entertaining too. It is not a high-end music experience as they are certainly playing for the tourists, but well worth the money to see the cathedral and hear the music carrying through the room."

Located in the Palais de Justice compound (with appropriate security) this place is a must-see, but make sure you go to the upstairs section as well as downstairs - the downstairs chapel is quite dark so the stairs to the upper chapel are not hugely obvious. Much of the building was destroyed in the revolution but it has been painstakingly restored and is stunning. The beautiful windows in the upper chapel depict scenes from the Bible from Genesis to the resurrection. And everything in the building is symbolic - you can pick up a leaflet on site which helps to explain the symbolism,"

That day was a bit rainy and cloudy but we actually lucked out with the weather because the line was only about 5-10 minutes long. The outside of the church is unassuming, not excessively huge with gargoyles perched at the top. When you first walk in, you're in a fairly small room and surrounded by stained glass walls. There's a little counter selling gifts and I was feeling pretty let down and unimpressed, especially since the tickets were 10 euros. But I noticed a little winding staircase to my right and got my hopes up and followed it up and lo and behold, there it was! The view when you step into the second room is heart-stopping. I'm sure it would have been even better on a sunny day but I was in absolute awe that it didn't even matter. The colors and details are to die for. Like everyone else has says, pictures do not do the Sainte Chapelle justice but make sure you still take them! Take a little video too because you can really get a 360 view of the stunning stained glass. One of the highlights of our trip to Paris!"

Once we made our way through the security screening checkpoint, we found a long line wrapping half-way around the side of the chapel. We then quickly discovered that they did accept the PMP and cut the line, walking right in with zero wait. Beautiful stained glass on the inside. There's a small (very small) winding staircase to get to the second level where the stained glass is, but it's not very long. PMP saved us about an hour wait."

Give yourself a good 45-minutes to get into Sainte-Chapelle because the staff modulates how many people can be in the cathedral at any one time, so if you don't time your visit correctly, you could be waiting a while. My suggestion: late-afternoon an hour before it closes. You only need an hour here, really."

Firstly, the Sainte-Chapelle had a small queue (tiny relative to other Paris attractions!). As I stepped inside it was a bit of a chock to be honest. This is still a religious building, but it felt more like I was at a tourist market! Even though there were signs to keep quiet (as most often there is in religious buildings of this sort), the noise level was rather overwhelming, as the amount of visitors was very high (definitely not a place for quiet reflection!), as well as the VERY strange decision to have the souvenir sales inside the chapel which obviously not only forces up the noise level but definitely takes away from the experience. Once you head up to the second floor things improve. I had a \"woaw\" moment as I come into the upstairs hall, as the windows are indeed breathtakingly beautiful. The building is spectacular. And also holds very important history being part of the early Paris. It is still very crowded up here ad the chapel is a small building, and you have to duck for selfie sticks. In the end, definitely worth a visit, but could have been a much nicer experience if management would have handled things differently.Tip: the beauty of the coloured windows rely on light so don't go when it's dark or a very dark grey day."

The interior is just simply jaw dropping beautiful.I have to say I was extremely moved by the experience, and wanted to stay longer, but unfortunately being part of a tour we had to move on. I decided to return the next day, and fortunately my husband was also willing to return.We arrived earlier in the morning the next day and got in very easily, with hardly anyone around. We made our way up to the upper level and I simply sat (there are plenty of seats provided) and took the beauty of the building in for at least one hour, interspersed with getting up and taking at least 100 photos.The interior detail with the light filtering through the stained glass windows is just something that everyone must experience. The craftsmanship is just extraordinary!I can't recommend visiting Sainte-Chapelle enough, please visit when you have time to just sit and take in the beauty before your eyes. Too many tourists just come in take a few photos and leave within half an hour.For me this is simply one of the most beautiful buildings in the world!"

Because of its size, the line to get in will stall then move then stall, as they let people in as groups depending on people exiting. Ten euros to get in, or Paris museum pass. You enter into a gift shop, turn hard left at the door and climb up a spiral stone staircase, quite a few steps. The chapel itself is rather small. The uniquely tall stained glass is a wow for many, but if you've seen Chartres then this will not impress you, but the architecture of much glass and little stone might. Went late in the day and there was still quite a wait."

You can easily spend an hour or so looking at the stories being told and clearly visible. Make this a must-see on your trip, a short walk form Notre Dame. When we visited on a Sunday we also enjoyed a nearby street market in Spring, filled with nursery flowers and caged birds for sale, making for beautiful photos."

And, from a small scale to large scale design perspective it was stunning. Even more amazing is that they don't currently know who designed the chapel windows. Even the Lower Chapel was beautiful. The painting was rich and largely restored. If you appreciate master craftsmanship and design you will enjoy Sainte-Chapelle. Be aware that climbing steep stone steps is required to get to the upper chapel. The windows are obviously more brilliant on a sunny day but the chapels would also be nice on a rainy day in Paris."

The sit back and take in the scope of the space as the colors play across surfaces and the guests."

The chapel was so beautiful with all it's stained glass windows and as you closed your eyes to listen to the music and take in the history of the chapel it was an unforgettable experience. Definitely a must to see but not good on a rainy day as no cover while waiting in queue."

It is an exquisite jewel box of a church. The magnificence of the stained glass must be seen to be believed. My visit was in the evening light a few hours before sunset, and the glass in the stunning upper chapel was perfectly backlit. The lower chapel was fabulous as well. Don't forget to walk around the outside to see the magnificent exterior architectural details."

Despite the sign , we were on a line waiting for the Palais of Justice and Sainte Chapelle was closed at the time for lunch. So please be aware of that if you get there around noon. We found a caf\u00e9 near Notre Dame and then came back to queue up for a 2 pm entrance. Sainte Chapelle is not the stand alone impressive building that you can expect in many areas of the world. We walked into an area with a low ceiling and very impressive d\u00e9cor. After some time there , we climbed some steps and entered a room that literally took our breath away. The chapel area is roomy but not huge but the windows soar to the heaven. All we could do for awhile was walk around the room with our eyes aimed skyward. The light streams in through the stained glass, the colors dance and we felt mesmerized. There is almost too much to process. There are a number of chairs placed around the chapel and we sat for some time and just let our eyes wander. It's the type of experience that you could enjoy for a long time , which we did.

We went to Sainte Chapelle with some friends on a chilly overcast December day , I wasn't sure what to expect , Sainte Chappele is steeped in history , it can be found in the center of Paris on Ile de la Cite , tucked in the courtyard of Palais de Justice.,( The nearest Metro station is Cite.).It was built for King Louis IX of France, who was very devout , as a chapel for the royal palace and also to house his collection of precious religious relics. Among these relics is reported to have been a piece of the True Cross. I was told that this was housed in the high alter . I am unsure if that piece of cross is still in the chapelle .There are 2 areas to see at Sainte-Chapelle , firstly the chapel downstairs , which on the day we saw it was dark and gently lit , but ,it was as I mentioned on an overcast cold December day that we were there. Downstairs is basically an empty room that has been sympathetically restored to show the original paintwork and an impressive vaulted ceiling , to many it may still look a bit tatty and a bit battered but much of this paintwork has been around for several hundred years so I am not surprised its had a good few knocks over its time .You can also see the pillars some of which seem to have been decorated with a raised paintwork and also a few examples of the stone work that was originally part of the Chapelle. The entry payment desk ( around 10 euros admission ) and the visitors shop are also situated within this lower part of the Chapelle. Not far from the entry desk there is a doorway that leads to some old stone steps that lead to another fairly empty room upstairs, DO go up these stairs as up at the top of them you turn the corner into the most magical part of the chapelle. , This is where all those stained glass windows are that you have I am sure read about. .Even knowing that they were there dis not prepare me for the spectacular sight , the stained glass is spectacular even on a cold and overcast day , I can only imagine how it will sparkle and throw some colour onto the floor on a wonderful sunny day. Look at the windows carefully , they all look a bit different, There are some simple long benches along the wall that you can sit on and study the wndows if you like.The alter is at the far end of the room opposite some enormous and strong doors with impressive old iron work that are never opened as they are simply in the wall of this tall building with nothing on the other side ! Look at the central pillar of these doors as you will see two little angels sitting and guarding the door. .so basically like another review has pointed out its a empty room , but a room steeped in history that is in itself spectacular because of those windows, the high vaulted ceiling , some statues and the tiled decoration on the floors. There is also another stair case for your return downstairs.would i recommend a visit to Sainte Chapelle , yes I would ....But don't expect a fully functioning church , its just not that ...Iits a small fairly empty chapel . BUT it is a truly awe inspiring sight as you turn that corner at the top of the stairs and see those windows for the first time, I found it simply breathtaking.One more thing ... there is no lift to the upstairs ,this is a historic building and the and stone stairs are a bit worn , this will make the wonderful upstairs of the Chapelle sadly unsuitable for a wheel chair user to access and possibly difficult for someone who has trouble climbing the stairs,"

The Chartress cathedral (a short sncf train ride from paris) was free and a fully operating Catholic place that had much more elaborate Windows.

The concert I attended was Bach's Goldberg Variations performed by a string trio (violin, viola, and cello). In this medieval setting, among the stained-glass (which we didn't get the full effect of on account of it being night), stone floors and high ceilings, I witnessed magic. You have to enter through a municipal building and grounds which doesn't do any favors to Sainte-Chapelle, but once you enter the chapel, it is a sight to behold. The contrast of dull municipality to medieval ornamentation is a sight to behold. Go. Do it. Next visit, I'll make sure to take a tour during the day to see the stained glass all lit up!"

The Sainte Chapelle is a stunningly beautiful 11th century church in the gothic style purposely built for the Kings of France inside the Palais de la Cite which now houses the Ministry of Justice. It is completely surrounded by stain glass walls. You marvel at the construction techniques and fathom the cost when you consider the year that construction commenced 1242 and was completed just six years latter. This church is no longer open to the praying public. The Chapelle hosts nightly classical concerts. When you Google Sainte Chapelle their nightly concert schedule is posted. You will be directed where you can purchase tickets on line or you can be like us and be fortunate to notice the sign and hunt down tickets once inside. Be persistent in your search for the ticket booth because it is not part of the gift shop and is hard to find. Tickets are in three sections with VIP being the first 10 rows. VIP were the only tickets available but to me it would seem to be worth the extra \u20ac10 just to heighten your visual and sound experience. Seats are not assigned (First come first seated) so it is best to line up in the visitation hall early. You must pass through security with metal detectors and bag search to see this beautiful chapel."

Since this gorgeous cathedral is not exactly out in the open like it's Notre-Dame neighbor, it can seem inaccessible for travelers not familiar with the Paris-area, but don't be dismayed! The Sainte-Chapelle is inside the entrance to the Concierge, so if you get off at the Cit\u00e9 metro stop and head towards the Boulevard du Palais, you'll see a line of people waiting to be let inside. Past the stone walls of the Concierge entrance you will immediately see the Sainte-Chapelle. The first floor is just a taste at what's to be found up the winding, narrow staircase - the infamous stained glass windows. There are places around the room for you to sit in wonder, and they also provide an informational guide for free (in many different languages) that explain in detail which books of the Bible are represented in these masterful works of art. Though it is not free like Notre-Dame, it is worth a trip!"

Since the stained glass windows were meticulously cleaned several years ago, the experience is heightened even more. Being able to take the time to view the images based on biblical stories is well worth the time. Printed material is available to give you an overview, but unless you're a biblical expert, it might be worth the money to hire a private guide to explain it all. Here's a tip to avoid the (usually) long line to enter the Chapelle -- buy a combined ticket to view the Conciergerie as well. You can view the prison cells and a re-creation of the cell inhabited by Marie Antoniette. The Conciergerie tour is interesting and only costs a few euros more...but that way you get to skip the line into Sainte Chapelle, which, on a busy day, can save you an hour or more."

There are some small walking areas and small vignettes on the lower levels but the history is truly what it's all about and I feel the stained glass was notches above the famous Notre dame glass which is stunning in and of itself.

Each time we made a little progress in the line, they would let a tour group in, much to the dismay and frustration of the waiting crowd. And this was in early April, not even in the 'high' season. Everywhere in Paris now you have to go through security lines and this slows things down getting in. If you can purge yourself of the frustration of the line and the security, then you can truly enjoy the magnificent stained glass in the chapel! There is some information printed on rigid boards in various languages that you can use to identify the biblical scenes if you want, or you can just bathe in the beautiful light. Best to go on a day when the sun is out, maybe even better if there are some big puffy clouds in the sky, to best show off the beautiful glass."

Across the square from Notre Dame Cathedral and somewhat behind the Palais of Justice, you will find the Sainte-Chapelle, small church devoted to Christ's Crown of Thorns. Enter and climb one of the two small spiral stairs to either the left or right back. You will be awed and amazed by the stained glass windows soaring to the roof. If you can get tickets to the Vivaldi concerts in the evenings, try to attend. You will be able to enter as the Kings of France did, through the grand top floor doors. The sunset light floods the windows and the music is superb. This is one of Paris' best experiences! Do not miss it."

There is a security inspection. You are entering the Palais de Justice. After security you proceed to the church. Entry is initially into the lower level of the church. It is quite beautiful and was used for worship by the lower classes. The upstairs is absolutely magnificent. Entry is by a small staircase adjacent to the door through which you entered. The stained glass windows present stories."

Recently restored, the windows tell the story of the Bible (Old and New Testaments) and well as the story of Louis IX and the obtaining of the crown. This is a \"don't miss sight\" in Paris. Located on the \u00cele-de-la-Cit\u00e9, the chapel is an easy walk from Notre Dame."

Sainte-Chapelle is a small but gloriously beautiful small chapel on the grounds of the law courts of Paris, less than a five-minute walk from Notre-Dame cathedral (which is also a must-see). I always bring friends who are visiting Paris, or strongly suggest they go. You enter downstairs, which is nice, but dark, and people usually wonder what all the fuss is about. Then they go upstairs! To see the most magnificent stained glass windows imaginable. Really gorgeous. If you go on a sunny day, when the sun is south, it will stream through the windows and make colors in the air. Just wonderful. This visit won't take long because the chapel is very small. The line for tickets, however, can take an hour or even much longer, depending on the time of year. So here's a tip...next door is La Conciergerie, which was a prison during the time of the French Revolution. The line to get in is usually very short, if there's a line at all. Inside, they sell a combined ticket to the Conciergerie and Sainte Chapelle. So that's a great way to skip ahead and not have to stand on the long line for the chapel. And the Conciergerie is definitely worth a visit. They have recreated a room similar to the one where Marie-Antoinette was imprisoned. It's bleak and shows just how awful her last days were. And there are lists of names of people who were guillotined during the Revolution, some of whom we can all recognize. For students of French history, I would definitely recommend the Conciergerie and, as I said, getting the combo ticket is the way to go."

I recommend that to all visitor, the place is worth to be seen and offer an excellent acoustic.Take care of yourself and come soon to France my friends.I would have liked to publish this review with a link of the concert in it, but apparently it is seen as commercial by TripAdvisor - even if I don't have any interest in sharing the info, other than allowing visitors to be as enthousiastic as we were.Gwena\u00ebl"

This is tucked away in the grounds of the Palais Justice, so plenty of gendarme walking around, but they're all so friendly, saying hello to everyone.. When we arrived, there was a bit of a queue but it moves relatively quickly; I'd say we queued for a total of about 30 minutes and this was just after lunchtime. When we first arrived into the smaller chapel downstairs, what struck me was how colourful it was, despite there being few windows. The decoration is really quite beautiful, but it's when you climb the stairs to the upper chapel things get really interesting.The upper chapel is so bright and airy, and the stained glass is out of this world. We had a relatively sunny day, so the colours were really vibrant, all blues, reds and greens, and just made this whole place look like a box of precious jewels. There is scaffolding to one side of the chapel (not sure this is work on the chapel itself but rather the building beside it) so we could really only get the benefit of the sunny day on one side of the building, however this was more than enough... I've done my fair share of cathedrals and churches in France, and this is completely different to anything I've ever seen before. There's a guide you can pick up (quite a large heavy plastic sheet) outlining the stories told in each of the windows, but to be honest we didn't really use this. There's a couple of benched dotted around if anyone needs a rest after the stairs (which aren't too cumbersome but for older people or anyone who just needs a bit of a sit down, these are handy). All in all, we were done in about 20 minutes, but if you wanted to take some more time looking at the stories of the windows, then I guess it could take up to an hour. Location wise, this place is great for grabbing a bite to eat, either before or after, and is only a five minute walk to Notre Dame."

I believe different ensembles play at different times throughout the year and if our experience is typical than the musical ability is first class. In such a setting it is an unforgettable experience. Thank you Mr Braccini and the rest of the musicians for giving us such musical beauty.

But make way up the tight spiral staircase in the corner and you will behold a truly breathtaking masterpiece of stained glass (just don't visit on a cloudy day). The windows at Notre Dame get rightful attention but they are just windows. St. Chapelle seems to be constructed almost entirely of stained glass, an effect that must be seen to be understood.

Try to make it on a sunny day to get the full effect of a royal chapel illuminated through magnificent stained glass on all sides. Be sure to take time so you can look at each unique window.The chapel, completed in 2 years (from 1246 to 1248) was erected by Louis IX, king of France, to house the Crown of Thorns and a fragment of the True Cross, precious relics of the Passion of Christ.Regardless of your religious affiliation, or lack thereof, the chapel, in and of itself, is a masterpiece of architecture and art. The best aspect of a visit to the Sainte-Chapelle is that, unlike the large cathedrals and churches, the Saint-Chapelle has an intimate feeling and one can feel a part of the chapel rather than an external viewer of an impersonal edifice.If it comes to a choice between the Notre Dame De Paris and the Sainte-Chapelle, visit the latter. You'll see more and it will be up close and personal."

When i went upstairs however, the sheer beauty of this amazing church actually brought a tear to my eyes. 90% of the 2nd level is just stained glass, with a beautiful golden casket that holds a very special relic - the corn of thorns worn by Jesus Christ (apparently).

That would be a mistake. Once you climb the short fight of steps to the second floor, you are surrounded by breathtakingly beautiful stained glass. My favorite time to go is early to beat the crowds. Then take a seat along the side and just watch the vibrant blues, reds, and yellows subtly change as the sunlight pours in. They often do concerts in the evening and sell tickets on location. It is a lovely, intimate contrast to the massive grandeur of nearby Notre Dame. It is easily reached by metro."

The concert experience is outstanding and I highly recommend that. One thing that's worth noting is that Saint Chapelle is closed from 12-2 pm so the staff can have lunch which is not noted on the website ( you'd think that would be a pertinent piece of information ). After lunch the day I was there it wasn't reopened until 2:25 which was somewhat annoying since it was quite cold out and many of us had started to line up well before 2pm ( I recommend this because otherwise the lines get really long ). So I guess the lesson in February is - bring lots of warm clothes because you will probably be waiting. I also take off a star for the tacky gift shop sitting right in the chapel - kind of ruined the experience of the lower chapel for me."

The first time I walked into Sainte Chapelle, I was impressed by the richness around me, but actually it was the service level that sold the usual tourist trinkets and books, etc. That area had been used as I recall for worship by servants, etc.Sainte-Chapelle was the private chapel of King Louis IX, the crusader king whose crusader army managed to be utterly defeated and captured by a Mameluk Army. In time he came home with what he claimed to be genuine relics from Jerusalem including the crown of thorns. If you can convinced yourself of that ... But it managed to convince Rome to declare him a saint.Be that as it may, Sainte Chappell is his most extraordinary relic, intended for him alone, as his personal royal chapel. He entered directly from his palace. As a more casual visitor, you climb a narrow stair case, nothing grand about it and a bit difficult for we infirm, and ascend, into a luminous fantasy of stained glass that seems to float, little holding them up but the light that pours them through them.The decoration of the the chapel is lush - no wonder, it was for the King. I've been back to the chapel many times over the last 40 years. Nothing has quit equaled the astonishment I had that first visit. Sometimes the light in terms of weather and time of day change the view. I would probably avoid a dismal rainy or very cloudy day. But it makes no difference to me. I go. FWIW, the chapel is said to be connected conceptually and construction methods to the great Cathedral of Amiens. I think that's not at all unlikely, but if you're a cathedral fanatic like me, Amiens is worth a trip, for the Cathedral in general, a night view if possible to see the LED replication of the polychrome exterior that was part of the original exterior."

I advice that you do St Chapelle on the same day as the Notredame and Ile St Louis because they are very close to each other. You can also do The Conciergerie (jail of the French Revolution and others details which I don't remember) on this day too as it is within the same gates as St Chapelle. Tickets can be purchased at St Chapelle which allows entry to this jail along with the Chapel itself. The first level of the chapel is boring, but don't forget that there is a second level! (we almost walked out without seeing it). You just have to go and see it yourself. It is beautiful. I wouldn't recommend this for people who are not Christian or at least interested in religion or maybe even architecture. The conciergerie is interesting. You can see the replica of Mary Antoinette's cell, and the chapel where it once was. There are exact replicas of jail cells which was very cool. Entry for these things is relatively expensive, but worth it for those interested in churches and/or jails."

If the concert were held in the late afternoon that would not have been an issue. False advertising was at play.

There are 12-15 tall, magnificent stained glass windows, plus a large, round \"rose window,\" that depict scenes from the Hebrew Testament on one side, with displays from the Christian Testament on the other.Sainte-Chapelle has been discovered by tourists, but it's still a welcome respite from the crowds at the nearby Notre Dame. Buy a Paris Museum pass so that you can freely attend a number of museums, at your own pace and timing."

After waiting in line for 90 minutes, we entered a darkened chapel, the only lights on the gilded pulpit, where the musicians performed.

Personally I prefer to go to a concert. There are signs for them near the entrance to Sainte Chapelle."

We took our place in the line about an hour before the scheduled opening time. Unfortunately, without explanation, the doors did not open until an hour after they were supposed to....so we still waited. But once inside, it was definately worth it! The gold and stained glass is truly breathtaking. I was surprised to find many vistitors taking a quick look around, a few snaps with their phones, and leaving. Try to get a seat and sit for a few minutes to enjoy the beauty properly, also the changes in light."

This was the longest line of our entire trip to Paris, and thank goodness we made the cut-off before they closed for lunch. Really? Closing for lunch? You would think they could afford to hire more help with the tourist money coming into this place. The stained glass windows on the second floor are probably the most beautiful windows in the world. I saw the rose windows in Notre Dame, and while they were beautiful, they did not surpass St. Chapelle. The detail of the Bible stories told on these windows is nothing short of legendary. It just saddened me that the building is no longer used for worship, for I am quite sure that the makers of the stained glass intended them to be aids to understanding the stories of the Old and New Testament. You do not have to be religious to appreciate their beauty, however, just go. Sit down. Take a deep breath. Enjoy"

But if you study the history and you will find that the stained glasses itself is the most stunning among the finest of their type in the world. As quoted in \"Wiki\" - \"For whose benefit the stone wall surface is reduced to little more than a delicate framework. Fifteen huge mid-13th-century windows fill the nave and apse, while a large rose window with Flamboyant tracery (added to the upper chapel c.1490) dominates the western wall. Despite some damage the windows display a clear iconographical programme. The three windows of the eastern apse illustrate the New Testament, featuring scenes of The Passion (centre) with the Infancy of Christ (left) and the Life of John the Evangelist (right). By contrast, the windows of the nave are dominated by Old Testament exemplars of ideal kingship/queenship in an obvious nod to their royal patrons. The cycle starts at the western bay of the north wall with scenes from the Book of Genesis (heavily restored). The next ten windows of the nave follow clockwise with scenes from Exodus, Joseph, Numbers/Leviticus, Joshua/Deuteronomy, Judges, (moving to the south wall) Jeremiah/Tobias, Judith/Job, Esther, David and the Book of Kings. The final window, occupying the westernmost bay of the south wall brings this narrative of sacral kingship right up to date with a series of scenes showing the rediscovery of Christ's relics, the miracles they performed, and their relocation to Paris in the hands of King Louis himself\"."

(Other advance ticket holders do get to cut in line but I don't know how those passes are obtained.) That said, once the wait is over, you can buy your Museum pass there. Incidentally, we were glad to have the Museum pass for getting into the Louvre. It saved us a 2 hours wait. If travelling with kids, buy passes for the adults. Kids get in free at the Louvre and are able to cut the line if their parents are pass holders.This was my fourth trip to Paris and my first trip to Sainte-Chapelle. I wish I'd discovered it sooner. The stained glass is stunning. In the corner of the chapel, there a cards in English that give some background information on each window. I handed my 12-year-old a camera and he was quite engaged in taking photos of the windows if not the history behind them."

Sainte-Chappele was built in less than ten years in the mid-13th century--light speed by medieval standards--to house Louis IX's collection of relics of Christ's Passion. The church's display of stained glass is stunning, reported to be the largest of its kind in the world. You can easily read about the history and see the photos, but you cannot appreciate this stunning gem of Gothic architecture unless you see with your own eyes. It's very small compared to its more famous neighboring church but so well worth an hour or so of your time in Paris."

            "review": "Avoid the concert. With so much expectation, I went to the concert of Christmas Eve at Sainte-Chapelle. It was a big disappointment with sub-standard performers (except the violin quartet). I could not believe my ears when the singers (a group of 4 men and 4 women) sang \"O Come All Ye Faithful) out of tune. They were shocked by themselves - one singer even stopped singing. The voices did not harmonize as they should. I think even not a seasoned audience could notice the problem. It gave me an impression that they did not practice and rush to finish the performance (probably because of other Christmas Eve activities). I sat in front and noticed that one of the singer did not even know which lines to sing and seek help from another singer. Towards the end, they did sing some nice songs with the violin quartet. It saved the show from complete disaster. Meanwhile, one could not deny that it was a beautiful 13th century chapel. For the concert, better avoid it or check very carefully who the performers are. If one insists to take the risk, here are some practical information regarding the logistic. You have to arrive at the main entrance early to go through the airport style security. There is no one to guide the queuing or provide any information. We just formed a line with some early birds (we arrived at 6.15pm for 7.30pm show) and hoped that it was the entrance and the way to line up. There was no information or usher of whether what to do. We just guessed that it was the way. We started to feel anxious when it was very quiet (the doors were tightly shut and not much light at the entrance. Just like a closed store). At 6.45pm, the door finally opened. We entered the place and went through the security. We then lined up again in an outdoor passage for another 10 mins. At 7.15pm, the security guard led us to the building and we waited a short while outside the chapel. If you visit the place in winter, better bring some warm clothing due to the outdoor waiting and there was no heating system inside the chapel. I would suggest to visit the place during day time to appreciate the stained glasses."

You climb a tiny, winding staircase, and the stained glass windows astound you with their complexity and jewel-like tones. The columns are all painted in beautiful colors and patterns, with huge amounts of gold leaf. It is often quite empty, and a lovely spot to meditate. Don't miss the window through which the royals viewed the service - and do go on a sunny day, to better appreciate the stained glass masterpieces."

To \"buy\" your entrance tickets, you can go the advance pass line, but NOT before security.

Before you skip Sainte Chapelle because it's probably Paris's only church that requires paid admission, read on, because you do not want to miss perhaps one of the most impressive churches you will ever see!With a small modest exterior that especially pales in comparison to the nearby Notre Dame Cathedral, Sainte Chapelle - French for \"Holy Shrine\" - was constructed by Louis IX (Now one of France's two top saints with Joan of Arc) to house the holy relics such as a piece of True Cross. Although the relics moved to the Notre Dame's treasury, the chapel still retained the very beauty that the French king deemed worthy to hold Christianity's most sacred items.Sure, by photo, Sainte Chapelle looks like just another church with stained glass windows, but look more carefully. While other churches' stained glass tend to be geometric or single-scene on a macro scale, Sainte Chapelle's take it to a much more meticulous level. Each of the fourteen windows tells a chapter in the Bible with all fourteen windows holds 1113 near-microscopic scene! The most impressive is the circular Rose Window that has even more minute details to illustrate the Apocalypse of St John.Combined with the beautiful blue ceiling dotted with golden stars and the twelve apostles that stood watch at every pillar, Sainte Chapelle is certainly a sight that you do not want to miss! Take about an hour to take in the beauty within. \u20ac9 is truly nothing compared to the feast for your eye that Sainte Chapelle has to offer.---tl;dr version:1) Holy Chapel designed to hold True Cross and other relics2) Impressive minutely detailed stained glass windows"

They are a very nice way to spend an hour or two during the early evening.

            "review": "Sublime - but there are problems .... This is a gem of Gothic art and architecture - not just my opinion, although I started what passed for my adult live in medieval studies. The chapel is laid out on two levels - the lower chapel, designed for use by the servants and courtiers of Saint Louis, the upper chapel the personal chapel of the King and his family. The lower chapel is low-ceilinged, and decorated with heraldic motifs of France and Castile (the country of the Queen Mother). The upper chapel (reached by means of narrow spiral staircases designed to allow servants access) is a soaring space dominated by stained glass windows supported by improbably slim stone dividers. The windows relate the main events of the Old and New Testaments. Below the windows, the France/Castile heraldic motif from the lower chapel is continued, supplemented by (sadly decayed) portrayals of Christian martyrs - the chapel was built by Saint Louis to house a first-class relic of Christ's Crown of Thorns. My most recent visit was last October (2015); I have been here six times before. Sublime, sublime, especially since the completion of recent restoration programme.There are, however, a number of \"issues\" -Standing in Line (Queuing): Long queues to be expected, especially in high tourist season. One reason - not sure that this is official policy, but the small size of the Sainte Chapelle makes it less than suitable for the sort of armies of visitors perpetually circulating in neighboring Cathedral of Notre Dame. Less justifiable is the very French talent for over-manning - trio of ticket issue and clearance \"officials\" is clearly unnecessary, and slows matters up even more than necessary (we queued for about 45 minutes in October, at a less than peak time). Related to this is ...Security: Delays in getting through the security check point at the entrance to the complex add significantly to the overall delay in the \"Line\" (dividing it - usually, I suspect, into two lines). This is very irritating but, I suspect, there is not much that can be done about it. Worth bearing in mind that the Sainte Chapelle is in the same security zone as the Superior Law Courts of Paris, not to mention the Pr\u00e9fecture de Police. When I was there in October, there was only one (admittedly slightly clunky) security checkpoint, manned by the Gendarmerie). May be different after recent unfortunate events. I can only say that it would be hard to expect the authorities to operate on a lower level of security in these painful times. Then there is ...Charmless staff - I do not generally seem to have as much problems with Parisian \"rudeness\" than most visitors. Perhaps because I have become used to it over the years. Nonetheless, I have to say that the crowd at the Sainte-Chapelle are a particularly charmless lot. It is hard to excuse this, really; the only thing I can suggest in their favor is they have a lot to put up with at times, the curatorial staff in particular. A very small number of such staff are required to supervise the behavior of a large number of visitors, some of whom themselves can be rude and careless of the need to behave themselves as adults. For example - on my most recent visit, a distinctly hen-pecked American husband decided he needed to tie a shoelace with his muddy boot supported by a chair. I can hardly blame the American for being distracted by his \"hen\" - but neither can I blame the (sole) curator in the upper chapel from being rather firm (not rude) in insisting that he desist. By the way - it is not, NOT a Good Idea to get into any form of confrontation with French security forces, whether Agents de Police (the ordinary Paris Police Force), G\u00e9ndarmerie Nationale, CRS, Army ... whatever. Not that I have ever done it myself but ... trust me.Toilets - a matter raised in some of the negative reviews In Here. What can I say ? This should not be an issue, were it not for the fact that the lines/queues are so long, as far as ordinary visits are concerned. As far as concerts go - I have attended concerts here (including one magical one, on my honeymoon, thirty years ago) and I have not had this problem. Hint - the area around is not short of bars and caf\u00e9s. Take precautions. The authorities are not likely to install convenient loos in the immediate vicinity of the Sainte-Chapelle soon (the medieval buildings are not terribly ... convenient for modern conveniences) and, while there are toilets in the surrounding official buildings, the question of security comes back into question there.The Light: In the Hands of God. No amount of floodlighting will compensate for the fact that the stained glass windows were designed to be seen, at their best, in strong to moderate natural light. If you are frustrated in your wish to take photographs, aim to visit at a time of reasonable light, and perhaps pray. And be reasonable. The unfortunate hen-pecked Yank to whom I referred above was being particularly \"pecked\" because his wife was not happy that the prevailing light was strong enough for her to take photos, even though it was actually quite strong. The Middle Ages were what they were ...Cost: Yes, it is expensive. This is the French model of financial support for national monuments and museums. One could make the same point about the Louvre, the Muse\u00e9 d'Orsay, the Musee Guimet, the Muse\u00e9 de l'Armee ... Can't say I approve of it, but there it is. What I can say about this case, at least, is that it is for the experience of seeing a truly world class example of Gothic architecture and art. Hence my recommendation.Conclusion: Lines/queues are likely to be a problem at any time of year. Try to come early, and be flexible. The areas of Ile de la Cit\u00e9, Ile de Saint-Louis and the adjacent Left Bank are beautiful. If the line at the Saint-Chapelle seem a bit long - veer off, and explore ... Come back at another time. And, always remember, Paris has many charms ... Best regards, JR."

When we finally did locate it, we were able to walk right in and skip the ticket queue thanks to our Museum Passes! Upon stepping into the lobby, we were a little underwhelmed. Don't get me wrong, the architecture is beautiful, but it was also where the gift shop was housed. My daughter looked at me and said, \"Is that it?\" I was convinced it wasn't, since I'd seen photos of the inside of Sainte-Chapelle and knew of the exquisite stained glass. So I poked around a bit, and there, tucked almost behind the gift shop counter was a small sign that read \"Haute Chapel\" next to a dimly lit stairwell. We climbed up the small spiral staircase to what is the main chapel, and comprises all those gorgeous photos you see online, and were just in awe. My daughter actually gasped when we approached the top of the staircase! There, you are surrounded by the most stunning, jaw-dropping, detailed stained glass I've ever seen.

I have seen quite a few churches and cathedrals over the years and they have begun to bore me a bit - same motifs are presented over and over again and in most cases with a quite similar techniques therefore I wasn't really sure what to expect from Sainte-Chapelle. It was a pleasant surprise. From the moment you enter the main chamber you fell a difference - you entered into extremely tall but rather small room. Main attraction are huge tall painted windows through which sunlight interestingly reflects various colors / parts. In addition, french royal sign is commonly embedded throughout the building giving it a charm I haven\u2019t experience for quite some time in churches/cathedrals.."

We were dodging a shower and near Isle de la Citi when my wife suggested that we might be able to duck into the Conciergerie, the oldest remaining part of the Palais de la Cit\u00e9, the first royal palace in the French capital that was used as a prison during the French Revolution. The added bonus being that you could buy a combined ticket for it and Sainte Chapelle next door.I never would have waited through the line to get into Sainte Chapelle, but with our tickets in hand we wandered past the snaking line and sauntered into the building. We overcame an initial underwhelming when we realised that we had to find a stairway in the corner that let up a winding staircase to the chapel. Now I have read quite a few reviews and spoken to people who had visited this chapel and I can tell you that not all visits are created equal. Luckily the shower we were dodging had gone on its way. It was mid September and late afternoon. When we entered the chapel the North side of windows was completely lit and quite spectacular. The sunlight was probably too bright if anything. The South side was completely dark. It didn't even look like windows - it looked like it was broken. Luckily we were impressed enough with what we could see to hang around. After a while we noticed that there was a bit of light coming through the south side and fpr the next half hour we were transfixed. As the sun moved further to the west and lowered in the sky the south side became brighter and brighter while the north side lost the slightly washed out look it had from too much sun and the coulours actually became stronger. After a half hour or so the light was even across the whole expanse of the windows and it was just mesmerizing."

However, once inside, it was magnificent. The concert itself (speaking from someone who is not particularly familiar with classical music) consisted of complete darkness other than the lights around the quartet and accompanying pianist and the natural light (whatever was left of it) coming through the stained glass windows.The highlight however was the music, Vivaldi's Four Seasons with a twist is the only way I can describe it. The musicians were incredibly interactive with the audience, at one point stopping to discuss (albeit in French so my understanding was limited) the individual components from each instrument.It was arguably the highlight of this and all other trips I've made to Paris and I would highly recommend."

But we had the museum pass, so could walk right thru. We traveled off season. Lines could be worse at other times. The chapel was very small but absolutely gorgeous. You enter thru the small chapel for palace staff on the ground level. This space was very pretty with a lovely blue ceiling. In this space there is also a small gift shop. You climb a small staircase to get to the main chapel above (I don't know if there is an accessible option for those who cannot navigate the steps) and what else can you say but \"breathtaking\"? We were fortunate to be there on a sunny day so most of the glass was illuminated. Do try to go on a sunny day near the middle of the day so that the sun will be shining thru the glass. The buildings around the chapel could block the sun very early or late in the day so around mid-day is probably best. It doesn't take long to see the site, but it is well worth going.

We stopped fairly early in the day but were put off by the long line, came back later in the afternoon -- still a long line. However, if you have the time to wait, it is well worth a visit to see the most awe inspiring windows! We've visited cathedrals and other churches in Rome, Brussels, Cologne, London . . . these are just the best windows -- and most are the originals from the 13th century. You do need to go to the second floor to see them -- not sure if there is an elevator."

A sight to enjoy before heading upstairs to see the stain glass lights! There is a narrow spiral staircase with around 20-30 steps that leads to the upstairs for the view of the sunlight reflection into the stain glass windows that are a story in pictures of the Bible. A sight that is totally unbelievable! There are chairs to sit and enjoy as well as interpretation boards that explain the 15 stain glass panels.

The line we were told to get in for the museum pass was actually longer than the other line. Beware that these outside lines are only for security and have nothing to do about whether or not you have a museum pass. We when earlier in the day and luckily an English speaking group had just come out and told us the security was down so no one was getting in. The employee standing in the front was very rude to them and they were basically told they would have to go to the back of the line when they came back later even though they had already waited in line once. When we came back later people were getting in again. The security check is a conveyer belt type so you have to take off your bags. After the security check you end up in a small courtyard (bathrooms to the left). You walk straight and get in line to either buy tickets or go straight up to the check in if you have the museum pass. It's fairly small inside compared to the number of people that were here. There is a room downstairs then your have to walk up a narrow one way spiral staircase to get to the room with the large windows. When you come down the other side in the other one way narrow spiral staircase you end up back in the same room you started in. I would recommend going in then straight up to the second floor since this is what people think about when they see pictures of this church. I personally would not waste my time going back here."

He found all of the other elevators we needed, to get to the right level. (Every place requires multiple elevators and extra time to figure it out.)The windows are amazing!!! All in one room, it was gorgeous. It was a gray day but the windows still had light coming through. Really worth seeing the beautiful colors. Amazing that was created in the Middle Ages. There is a lot of information on the particular bible passages each window illustrates. We bypassed the line completely, by having someone in our group in a wheelchair.

The history of the building combined with the beautiful dome ceiling and the stained glass makes this a must see while in Paris. Generally, there are long entrance lines- so here is a tip. Go to the Conciergerie next door and purchase the combined ticket for it and Sainte- Chapelle. Visit the Conciergerie first, then go to St-Chapelle where you will be allowed to skip the line because you purchased this double ticket. The Conciergerie is fascinating and you will be glad you toured it as well."

The security line moved rather quickly on one visit and then slowly on the second (both early morning visits). The architecture outside is fantastic and the interior is stunning. The commoners worshipped below and their area is less ornate than the space reserved for the nobility that is on the top floor. You ascend a tight spiral staircase (reminded me of the Blarney Castle except it wasn't wet and slippery) into a massive nave filled with coloured light streaming in through massive stained glass windows. Rick Steves book offers a great little tour of the church and its windows. Oddly the written guides available inside had some of the windows confused. In any event you'll see pictures from the bible and antiquity (Cain and Abel, Moses, Jesus and Holofernes). Louis IX built this church to house the Crown of Thrones relic (now in the treasury at Notre Dame). It was built in record time and cost a fraction of what he paid for the relic."

We joined the line, and after passing through airport-style x-ray machines, we climbed a flight of ancient stone stairs to the vestibule where ticket holders waited for entrance. Non-ticket holders were directed to a small table where a young man with a cash box sold tickets from one of 3 price tiers, ranging from 25\u20ac to 65\u20ac. After a brief wait, we entered the nave and chose a seat; the lights dimmed, and the performance of Mozart's Requiem, Bach, Handel, and Vivaldi, by a string quartet and accompanying choir, began. Excellent acoustics, though cold, as medieval churches would be expected to feel at night, made for a magical evening."

HelloThere are a few suggestions that I have to seeing and really enjoying the sounds and beauty of Saint-Chapel which is on the Ile de la Cite\u2019, near Notre-Dame. During the day you will see very long queue lines to view this beautiful building. My suggestion to really enjoy this beautiful blue stained glass cathedral is to take in one of the many concerts that are preformed weekly in this cathedral. By doing this, it cuts down the wait time considerable, however the seats are not reserved so getting here 45 minutes early before the concert would not be a bad idea. There are usually 2 performances each night, take the first performance if it is in late spring, summer or early fall and you can watch the light come through the beautiful blue stained glass windows as the sun sets. Then you can sit back and enjoy the fantastic acoustic sounds throughout the cathedral from the concert you have chosen.A suggestion for purchasing tickets, you can buy them on line or wait until you are in Paris depending how long you are in Paris to visit. If you choose to purchase while in Paris, across the street from the cathedral, there is a small tobacco/smoke shop (NOT the Restaurant) that sells tickets, they are very helpful and will show you the seating chart, concert times and what composers that are available. I would also choose the seat section Category \u201cA\u201d which is the middle section for the best value. Please remember the seat are only reserved by section and not by individual seats so the earlier you get into the line outside prior to the concert time the better the seat will be inside.Have a Great time and enjoy Paris the \u201cCity of Lights\u201d to its fullest.ThanksLary1047"

Between 5 to 10 people are allowed in at a time since it is such a small church. There is a 8.50 Eur. fee (at the time of this writing) charged and you will have to go through a security check of purses, coats and totes. The first floor has wonderful colors, designs and other artifacts to see but the real treat is on the second floor. Be careful because the staircase is narrow and winding like one you would find inside a lighthouse. Once you catch your breath, look up and around and get ready to be impressed.This is the jewel in the crown of this church. The 1,113 scenes are astounding. It took almost forty years to complete these panels that are read left to right, bottom to top. I've been told that on a sunny day, the colors spill out throughout the building like jewels. Look for the information cards that are in various languages that explain the panels and how they were created.The stain glass will humble you as you give thanks that such craftmanship has been perserved for all generations to see."

The side walls of the upper chapel are all long, thin arched stained glass windows.

Once you get in, look around but then find a chair and sit for awhile. I stayed there for close to an hour. Now, some particulars: The chapel is small so they can't let hordes of people in. Ergo, there will be a long and slow queue. It's never short, so you just have to queue up and wait. It was not especially busy when we visited and it took us 45 minutes to get in. Just plan on it. Second item: When we visited they closed from 1pm to 2:30pm. Check the sign at the head of the queue. If you are in line when they close you are just out of luck and have to return later. Don't get in line less than an hour before closing because you run a good risk of wasting your time and not getting in."

So as I wandered out to the 1st Arr. to go to Notre Dame I run across Sainte Chapelle. Luckily it was part of my Museum Pass although there was not Fast Pass but the line moves quickly. So as you enter you are not sure exactly where you are going pr what it is you are seeing. That does not end as you enter the Chapel, I was taken a back a bit as I thought really this is what the big ta do was about. But DONT leave... the amazing part is upstaires. There is a small sign pointing to a stairwell leading upstairs. It is a bit of a windy staircase kind of reminds me of the staircase to the Blarney Stone. But once up there you will be awe struck. I cannot put into words enough how absolutely beautiful this place is. My niece told me don't try and capture it with pictures it just does not do it justice. Make sure you take the time and just look not through a viewfinder or with your IPhone but just your eyes. As I was looking my eyes starting tearing with just how beautiful it is. The story is amazing and the history behind the stained glass windows is so interesting. There are so many sights in Paris to see but this will go down in my top 5. Take the time, take your time and see this amazing site."

On our recent trip to France, we had the luxury of time and being able to enjoy Sainte-Chapelle not once, but twice.So many terrific reviews on TA for this sanctuary, I would only be repeating the obvious, however, here is a few things to know, if you go:- Sainte-Chapelle is only a few minutes away from Notre Dame on the Isle de la Cite.- Don\u2019t let the line dissuade you from going in! Actually, the line you see on the street is the security line. As Sainte-Chapelle sits among several occupied government buildings.- Once you are past the security checkpoint and scanners, follow the signs back to the entrance of the church, where you can buy admission tickets (8.5 Euros for adults), cash or credit cards- The box office, for concerts at Sainte-Chapelle, is located just to the left of the line to buy general admission tickets \u2013 if you want to buy concert tickets in person, please note they only accept cash.- The lower level of the church, where the bookstore is located, is almost as beautiful as the upper levels.- Once upstairs, you are surrounded by the beautiful stained glass panels, it\u2019s like being inside a jewelry box!- We attended a violin and harp concert at 8:30pm; it was a magical experience that was only shared with about 40 other attendees. Purchased VIP section seats at 30-40 Euros, however, ANY seat would have been just fine, as there was not a huge crowd.- Seeing the church late at night it a very different experience that during the day, you do lose the jewel box effect, however the church is just as stunning.Based on our experience, if you want to take lots of photos, see Sainte-Chapelle on a sunny day, if you want to an almost \u201cprivate\u201d experience enjoy a concert at night. I am glad that we captured the photos in the day, as it the ability to take them at night is limited."

It is one of Paris unique treasures and a must for any visitor to Paris. You should not miss it.The admission is 8.50 euro which is great for what you get. The lines were extraordinary long. We come back second time, as we stayed closed by, and it was even longer so third time, we got up early, and was there about 9am and had only a dozen in from of us as it opens at 9:30am. yes we had to wait 40 minutes but it is worth it, I promise. The church itself is situated in the centre of one of Paris many palace which is now used for government buildings, I think. You go through security, and then into a smaller courtyard area through to front of church, that's where you buy your tickets. There is two levels to this small church, the bottom level being gift shop area and an alster area, Then you go up a spiral staircase to nothing more than sheer magnificence, its beautiful. I am sure you can get on the internet and see for yourself, but not one of those photos have anything on seeing it real. its just breathtaking. Definitely, get up early, beat the line and see it before the crowds. Also do this church first then Notre Dame. Its easy to find just one street north (lourve direction) from Notre Dame. You'll see huge iron gates, entrance is just to left off them. Also keep in mind, while we were there plenty of people we going up with pre purchsed tickets and Paris Pass tickets expecting to skip the line but they didnt let them, so keep that in mind. So Go there, spend an 1/2hour or so and just take in the magnificence which is Saint Chapelle's Church"

A word of caution: They restrict the number of guests inside, so they only let in groups of 10 or so at a time. We were there on a Monday at 4 p.m. and waited more than an hour."

And boy was I surprised with Sainte - Chapelle! I had no idea what I was in for and I fell in love with it right away! The smell, the low light downstairs and the breathtaking stained-glass windows upstairs, the blue and the gold, the gothic in it and all the elegance: it just easily became one of the most beautiful churches I have ever seen!The Sainte - Chapelle is a definite must when visiting Paris and it is most definitely worth the usual loooong queue!"

They are just breath-taking. We were there on a sunny day, so the light pouring through the windows was stunning.We arrived to the line just in time for them to have closed for lunch (from 1pm to a little after 2pm!) So please time your visits more carefully than we did! By the time the chapel reopened after lunch, the line to get in was around the corner, down the street and looped back on itself all the way to the front of the line again! It is a small chapel, so they don't let too many people in all at once. It shares an airport-style security entrance with a justice hall, so don't let the other line/entrance confuse you.Once you exit the security area, you are in a courtyard area and it isn't terribly obvious where to go. Go around a smaller building in the center of the courtyard to the left side of the central building. On the far side of the smaller central building, you will find the entrance to the chapel.Inside the chapel, you enter on the lower floor, which seems kind of dark and disappointing. Turn to your left just inside the entrance and go up the small staircase to the room upstairs, where the beautiful windows extending up to the roof will greet you. There are chairs around the outer edge of the open room upstairs for you to sit and just gaze up at the stunning windows. When you have soaked it all in, then you can go down the little stairs to the left of the ones you came up and visit the room below before exiting out the entrance to the chapel.To get back out onto the sidewalk and street - follow along the side of the chapel and head to your left. You will go out a large gated area. It is a little confusing, but if you keep in mind that the chapel is inside the courtyard of a justice center, some of these unusual-for-a-tourist-attraction features will make a little more sense.Tips: The Paris Museum Pass doesn't seem to get you priority access - or it didn't when we were there, but it will save you waiting in line to buy a ticket.The courtyard area is partially cobblestoned and uneven, so watch your step.The staircases going to the upper room in the chapel are small and uneven and worn down, so step carefully.As with all museums in Paris, check the opening/closure times and closure days, so you aren't disappointed to arrive to find it closed. (Although there was no where that I read that Sainte-Chapelle closes for lunch, so that was a surprise!)"

It is 5 minutes from the Notre Dame and it is so beautiful when you get inside. The audio guide is really worth the money as it explains all of the windows. It is a stunning chapel but it is worth the audio guide as it was helpful to see where to look for certain paintings."

It is all the more fascinating whilst the stained glass is being restored. To see Before & After is a real experience. The evening concerts are a delight with the low evening sun coming through the windows. Tickets obtainable at the cafe opposite. You get a bonus as the entrance to the chapel is through the law courts building. Notre Dame is big and brash but to me Saint Chapelle is the real hidden gem on Ile de la Cit\u00e9."

I'd intended to visit the Musee D'Orsay that day, but the lines were insane so I opted for St. Chapelle (circa 1239), a 10 minute walk away. After waiting in a very slow moving queue for over an hour (I considered leaving on several occasions), I finally obtained my ticket to enter. I climbed the 40+ stairs from the entry point, and emerged into one of the most dazzling spaces I've ever seen. I literally gasped. The sun pouring through the 15 stained glass windows created a light more beautiful than I could have ever imagined. I'm not a particularly religious person, but I can truthfully say I felt the presence of the divine during my visit to this amazing temple."

If I'm in Paris with people who have never been here, I always bring them - but first thing, because it can be hellishly busy, with huge queues and - despite the 'silence' notices and shushing attendants - a fair amount of noise and people too busy taking selfies to look about them.Be there early enough and it is completely magical, like being inside a jewellery box - which, of course, you almost are, because it's a huge reliquary. Now that more of the astonishing medieaval glass has been cleaned it is even more amazing - sparking in red and gold and blue, with not an inch left undecorated. Wonderful, and even better if you let the magic work on you. Everyone I have brought has been blown away by it, but in other, busier, circumstances it could be horrible.Some people are reluctant to climb the spiral stairs to the main chapel. If you are uncomfortable with this, there's little point in visiting. There's some glass downstairs, and the sales area (of course), but hardly worth the effort. And the main chapel is not easily accessible, as far as I know, any other way. Upstairs - get there early."

The one hour concert inside the stunning Sainte-Chapelle chapel was romantic and intimate, and is a worthwhile experience for anyone that enjoys classical music. We booked tickets for the concert online a couple weeks before arriving in Paris. We opted for seats in the VIP section and ended up sitting in the fourth row, which allowed us a good view of the musicians and ample time to sit and appreciate the impressive alter and architecture without the distraction of hordes of tourists. The 800 year-old chapel's towering stained glass windows make for a beautiful and unique concert venue, especially if you can catch one of the sunset shows, and the acoustics were perfect. Music by Pachelbel, Vivaldi, and Vitali was featured, and many of the pieces were familiar to us. The musicians also played passionately and really seemed to enjoy playing together. The concert lasted around one hour and let out around 8PM time, and we were able to walk to one of the many nearby restaurants for dinner.The chapel is located within an important government ministry complex, so arrive early and expect a long line to get through security. Once inside, the seating is not assigned, so the best seats will be taken early. The lead violinist did wander down the main aisle during one of his solos, but it can be difficult to see the rest of the musicians unless you stake out an aisle seat or sit close to the front. The price difference between the VIP and regular seats wasn't much and puts you much closer to the front. The weather was also hot when we visited, and the ancient chapel became quite warm with all the concert-goers packed in, so dress appropriately. Lastly, there is only one public restroom stall located in the courtyard of the complex, and there will be a long line after the concert if you need to use it.We really enjoyed the concert and the beautiful chapel, and would recommend the concert to anyone that appreciates classical music and is seeking a one-of-a-kind experience during their tour of Paris."

I decided since my aim was to see the windows at sunset to book tickets in the least expensive area and at the earliest time. Those were good choices! 95% of the windows were visible and even though the day had been cloudy, the sunset shone through them. and, the music? It was wonderful! No, we didn't have a clear view of the musicians, but the music engulfed us."

The other option is you could purchase a combination ticket from the Conciergerie, another tourist trap next door where Marie Antoinette was imprisoned. The key is though, that this combo ticket will although costing you an extra 6 euros or so, let you bypass the line to get into the Sainte-Chapelle which at the best of times can be 45 minutes along the side of the church.It's not a big cathedral but it is an important one. The views are stunning and what you'd expect to see from a 13th century masonry wonder. It's part of the tourist collection on the island of Paris close to Cathedral de Notre Dame, and easy access from metro subway. One of the things you have to see in Paris if you like keepsake pictures or appreciate old and beautiful architecture."

Tickets can be bought a few days before at the tabac over the street from the entrance, or for a little more on line on the day. The concert was at 7pm so the stained glass windows were glowing with the setting sun. As the concert progressed, the colour slowly faded as it got dark. The musicians were first rate and the violin soloist who featured most of the time was extraordinary. The atmosphere and acoustics were perfect. If you can afford to pay a little more for your ticket, this is the best possible way to experience this breathtaking work of art, Sainte Chapelle. In my top five things to do in Paris.

Once you ascend the narrow winding stairs and emerge from the stairwell, the sight of the chapel which greets you is breathtaking. I'm no churchgoer, but the colors and that soft, warm hue which bathes the high halls of the chapel, illuminated by the sunlight outside shining through the painted glass windows... it's so amazing and beautiful.I could've just sat in there and gaped at those gorgeous, colorful painted glass windows for hours. And when the church crew turned on the chandeliers hanging from the ceilings, it threw the hall into yet another kind of bright, glowing beauty.Do take a look if you're in Paris.

I first saw it (both downstairs and up) three decades ago, and several times since, the last time in May 2015 for an evening concert. The concert itself was not bad (mainly Vivaldi, nothing adventurous), but the surroundings in the upper chapel are beyond compare. The upper chapel was executed at a time when High Gothic lay great emphasis on soaring arches and windows so large that the interior, notwithstanding the extraordinary stained glass that fills every inch of the openings, has light of almost daylight intensity. It is actually difficult to believe that this chapel was constructed almost simultaneously with nearby Notre Dame, in a style that is far heavier. Sainte-Chapelle, which along with the Concergerie (also worth a visit) is nearly the only survivor of the original Capetian palace, needs a lot of time to absorb."

I counted 15 stained glass that reflected the afternoon sun and provided illuminating multi colored rays to the insides of the church.

The only thing we couldn't help but notice was that some of the building was falling apart. Hopefully they are going to restore it."

Understandable, given the circumstances. The entrance is very unassuming, as the church is located inside the Palais de Justices de Paris, but once inside, the lower level certainly does not prepare you for the splendor of the upper chapel! The windows are amazing, and sadly, we visited on a cloudy day, so I can only assume how spectacular they must be on a bright, sunny day! Grab one of the information cards at the entrance to the chapel to pin-point each of the windows and its significance. Try to follow each of the stories from the bible. Sadly, our experience was marred by a large scaffold hiding the rose window at the far end of the room, but with buildings this old, there is bound to be some restoration work being done eventually, and I guess the scaffold is a good trade-off to Sainte-Chapelle closing completely. All in all, worth the wait, but I would definitely return on a sunnier day!"

Its architecture is amazing with a huge percentage of its walls made entirely of incredibly beautiful stained glass windows. It is a miracle they have survived for so many centuries!. The low ceilinged bottom floor [entry level] of the chapel is impressively ornate, but when you climb the twisty little medieval stairs to the second floor, the chapel reserved uniquely for the king, your jaw will literally drop. The soaring walls of richly colored stained glass will take your breath away. If possible go on a day that is not very sunny, as the bright light can diminish the richness of the windows' colours."

Saint Louis would go to mass there via a passage that went directly from his palace to the splendid upper chapel of the Sainte Chapelle. This chapel's walls are filled with very many stained glass windows, showing scenes from the Bible. During mass, Saint Louis sat under the stained glass windows showing the kings of Israel as provided in the Old Testament's books of Chronicles and Kings. Of course, this was an appropriate spot for a man who himself was a king. His mother sat across from him on the other side of this chapel during mass, a woman who had much responsibility for Saint Louis' holiness.  Over the altar at the front end of the chapel was the crown of thorns Christ wore and slivers of the cross on which he was crucified. Saint Louis had purchased the crown of thorns from the Byzantine emperor, who was in need of money at the time. Saint Louis built the Sainte Chapelle to put the crown of thorns in. (The crown of thorns is no longer in the Sainte Chapelle, though, but kept in a safe place in Paris' Notre Dame Cathedral.) I did not think the stained glass windows of the Sainte Chapelle, individually, impressive works of art, but all together they are impressive. To have the wall of a church filled with glass was a new and outstanding accomplishment in architecture at the time, and remains an impressive accomplishment today. There is a lower chapel in the Sainte Chapelle which was built for the general public in Saint Louis' day, but the upper chapel is the memorable part of this building."

There is no point in purchasing better seats, everyone is close and the acoustics are fantastic. You can buy tickets on-line with a fee or purchase them at the church. Don't expect to tour the church during the concert, you are basically lead in and then lead out. We visited earlier in the day and it is worthwhile for both trips.

Sainte-Chapelle is a masterpiece of Gothic architecture; the roof appears to be supported by stained-glass so that this magical space feels like the inside of a jewel. The stained-glass will leave you speechless. This is a MUST see. It took a while to get in because of the heavy security."

By the time we left (at around 11 30 something) the queue was hardly 2-3 people. The Chapel had an entry fee (around 13 Euros) but my wife and I really liked the place. The murals, their beauty, their precision, the details in them\u2026All of it was really worth it. A must visit. If you could read about it before going you may be able to appreciate it better"

The performance was very good with an interesting arraignment of the classic. The setting was almost the main attraction. We were seated while the sun was setting and the stain glass windows were still glowing and the acoustics seemed very good to my untrained ears. It's only about an hour but worth the money."

I've been here twice before, but my husband and I came here in February. The line was long because it was right before they close in the afternoon, so the wait was awhile even on a February weekday. But it was still as beautiful as I remembered it. I also like that they have the laminated guides so you can read what each panel is about. Note there isn't much seating. There's are also concerts on Sunday nights, so next time I go that would be a great way to see the chapel!A definite must see in Paris"

The \"Wow\" factor is universal. Built in the 1400s to house holy relics purchased from the declining Byzantine Empire it is a triumph of late mediaeval stained glass. How the walls with so much glass and so little stone has survived all Paris has been through is a minor miracle. Definitely a \"Must See.\" Don't leave Paris without seeing it, on a sunny day if possible. You have to pass through a metal detector so remember to leave Swiss Army knives etc. with the tobacconist across the street."

We jumped at the chance this visit to go to an evening concert there...Vivaldi and Pachelbel. This was scheduled for 7 pm, it was September and still daylight, therefore the magnificent stained glass windows could still be appreciated. Not so by the time we left.

We had a Paris Museum pass which didn't seem to matter even though there was a separate line for it (it was closed). Once inside however there was another line allowing us to bypass the ticket line. Go figure.Since the entrance is into the lower chamber be sure to climb the stairs in the back corner of the church to ascend to the top chamber where the windows are located.While I took a number of pictures I think with over 2000 photos already posted you get the drift of what this place is all about and posting them isn't necessary.Again, if you can make it while it's sunny it will be a better experience.We also visited the chapel in the Chateau at Vincennes, which is a smaller version of this chapel, and it does not compare in it's stained glass detail or colors to this chapel.Be sure to get a pamphlet which will describe how old this building is, and it's origins."

If you want to avoid the crowds and have a lot of time at the church, get tickets to see one of the evening string quartet concerts. The musicians are first-rate and the setting evening sun makes the windows especially beautiful. Tickets for the concerts can be purchased at the church; however, it's best to buy them in advance.

After our bags were x-rayed and we walked through the metal detector, we purchased our tickets (\u20ac8.50 ea) and entered. WOW! The sun illuminated the windows and the religious motifs were clearly visible. The public with us were quiet as they surveyed the beautiful pictures.Then we ascended the narrow circular stone staircase to the chapel proper.WOW WOW WOW!!! The vast expanse of stained glass windows was simply beautiful beyond words. The carved figures were incredibly detailed and we felt our spirits touched in this sacred place."

I was not disappointed by the building - it was everything i had dreamed it would be. It is the conception that is breathtaking - it is the medieval version of the modern architect's trick of reducing the scale of the walls of a building and maximising the acreage of glass - in this case filling the available space with stained glass. that so much of the glass has survived given where it is and what has happened around it is testimony to the efforts of many generations in protecting it. in itself, that is impressive. This was on my bucket list - it was a good choice.the chamber music was well performed - but was unchallenging.There is a lift."

I would recommend going to the conciergerie which is just next door and purchasing a joint ticket from there, not only does it mean you save money but it also allows you to skip the queue!!!"

Read the history prior to your visit- the stained glass renovation has recently been finished, and since more than 70% is still original- it is a real masterpiece. The queues can get long, so go early. Pay attention that the queues are for security only: so if people 'with tickets' try to cut the queue, send them to the back of the line! This has happened to me on several occasions.. Sometimes guided tours push their way ahead, which is very annoying. But despite the entrance sagas, I think the Sainte Chapelle is one of the top 5 most important and impressive sights in Paris."

St. Louis' private chapel, built to house his personal collection of relics, is a beautiful structure with fascinating narratives in glass built in the Gothic Rayonnant style at the height of its popularity. The bas \u00e9glise was extremely interesting and the only place I've seen a \"dry sink\" (where unused consecrated wine from the sacrament of Eucharist was disposed of) still in situ. The problem, predictably, with such a magnificent monument, is the number of people crammed into the structure. It was nearly impossible to take good pictures (I had specific windows I wanted to photograph) or just to stand quietly and take in the majesty of the space. My advice to anyone would be to ask around and find out the least popular times for tourists and go then. We waited in the pouring rain for twenty five minutes to get inside, and I would trade seeing the inside of St. Louis reliquary structure for anything, but I do wish I could have experienced the space without the carnivalesque atmosphere. On a completely touristy note, the gift shop (in the bas \u00e9glise) is fantastic."

This church is far smaller, and it's all about the stained glass, which is exceptional, I have never seen anything come close. There is an English handout explaining the Biblical significance of each panel of glass, honestly I have a fair amount of knowledge of the biblical stories, and they were hard to makes out due to the detail and magnitude of each panel. Thus, you may find it best to just enjoy the beauty, rather than straining to find a specific biblical depiction. There are also great statues of the apostles ringing the chapel. The fact that this church was built so quickly and in the 11 th century is in stark contrast to its neighbor, Notre Dame. The area in which this church is located is interesting because it is on the island in the middle of the Seine which is an interesting vibrant neighborhood with restaurants, people watching, and nice views of the Seine."

Instead of a sextet of musicians, there was an alpha male whose behavior was manicky and five supporting musicians. They raced through the concert. The leader turned pages for other musicians, engaged with other musicians as I've seen rock stars do and at one point almost lost his violin due to robust bowing. After the applause, we were ushered out to see the next suckers lined up for a concert. I really felt ripped off."

We arrived for our visit to find a somewhat-daunting line of people waiting to get in. As noted by other reviewers, the line moved fairly quickly. It seemed like they allowed around 20 people to enter every 5 minutes. It took us 35 minutes to get in, which was not so bad, given that the area where the line forms was shaded by tall trees and it was nice, sunny morning. Also, there was plenty of activity on the street that afforded some enjoyable people-watching. This served distraction enough to make the wait seem shorter than it actually was. Once through the main gate there is another, shorter line that we waited in to get into the actual chapel. One enters the church on the first floor into a fairly dark room with a low ceiling. It almost feels claustrophobic at first. It\u2019s as though this part of the experience serves as a contrast to what is experienced when one climbs the dark staircase to the second floor. That\u2019s where the light comes in. There is a sense of heaviness being lifted away as one enters this floor. Yes, it does seem like the walls are entirely made of glass, and yes, it is phenomenal. Photos I have seen do not allow one to experience the sensation of being in the actual space. There is a certain patina to the entire interior. This is especially true on the first floor, where the color of the wall decorations seems muted and rather dark in tone. It has the distinct feeling of gilded, medieval ornamentation, which I enjoy. It was worthwhile to browse around for a second time this aspect of the atmosphere when returning to the ground floor. The entire experience was \u201cabsolutely stunning.\u201d An interesting contrast between light and dark\u2026"

When you arrive, it almost looks like you aren't looking at anything that great. The outside had a queue for people to stand in and some signs and when you went into the courtyard, the building was really cool to look at but it left you wondering what you were getting yourself into. However, once they guided you into the chapel, it was immediately obvious what you were missing. The stained glass was absolutely breathtaking. For the concert, they had setup rows of seating and we opted for the VIP tickets so we had the option of the first few rows. While it is not the proper thing to do, we got the option to sit in the front row and did so. The people behind us moved (I'm tall and a big girl, so sue me) but if you tell an American they can sit up front, they're taking it. It was breathtaking being inside of the chapel but when the musicians started to play, it was my favorite thing to do in Paris, hands down.They played for almost a whole hour and you could tell they had great chemistry. On the backdrop of this stunning chapel, it was a great experience. Go, enjoy the music, take in the history and be as in awe as I was. It is still my favorite experience and I look forward to going again one day."

We tend to forget that all of these churches were painted when first built so to see these vaults and cross vaults done in royal blue with gold leaf accents impresses on the visitor the emotional impact on entrance for worshipers in those long ago days.

The Cathedral of Chartres gets all the hype for its stained glass windows but La Chapelle has more impact on me because it has such an overwhelming feeling of delicate, almost fragile, beauty unmatched by any other church in Christendom. No other medieval church I have seen (and I have seen a lot) conveys such ethereal beauty. Highly reccommend a visit and it's easy to do with Notre Dame because it is literally across the street from that hallowed church."

We had to queue a lot twice: to access the enclosure (security control) and to buy tickets but it was so worth when going upstairs and discovering those paintings on the glass. It is amazing, I have never seen something similar.The worst part is that, in my opinion, it is too expensive: 8.5\u20ac for a very short visit. If you plan to go to Notre Dame (for free), you may decide to skip Sainte Chapelle. It all depends on how much you love art and how much money you want to spend. Behind the altar in Notre Dame there are some windows which look familiar.Anyway, I would still pay again to visit Sainte Chapelle (despite I was amazed when I realized I had to pay, since most churches in Paris are available freely."

Walking into the chapel on a sunny day is like being bathed in a glowing, purple wonderland, and you cannot help but wonder how medieval architects and artisans could have built something so awe-inspiring. The best way to experience Sainte-Chapelle, though, is to buy a ticket for one of the concerts they offer during the summer months. I attended an evening concert, and had the singular joy of listening to Vivaldi on a centuries-old violin (pianoforte and recorder), while basking in the warm purple glow of the chapel windows. Not only was the music delightful, it was a pleasure to experience the chapel at leisure, when it wasn't choked with tourists. Highly recommended."

Even to the non-religious amongst us it is clearly a masterpiece of the high gothic period. Intimate, as a royal chapel should be, but enormous in the way that only a room higher than it is long or wide can be. The stained glass and the other decorations, including in the lower chapel, are quite magnificent. Suspending ones disbelief at the flamboyance, the colour and light, of the whole concoction and assessing the high chapel as a piece of architecture the question that comes to mind is: what is actually holding the roof up given that the windows seem to occupy 90 percent of the walls? Notre Dame might have been built to impress the peasants, but Sainte Chappelle was built for a King. Go and see it - you won't be disappointed."

I return to Sainte-Chapelle each time I return to Paris...and, it's Paris' gift to me...waiting since the 14th century! Many words can be written, but the words pale by comparison when you experience this gem, sitting quietly alongside the Palais du Justice on Isle de la Cite. Neither the largest cathedral in Paris, nor the most famous....but certainly worth the ticket price, and the wait in line, if there is one. The best rule of thumb...try to see Sainte-Chapelle on a sunny day! Walking in downstairs and you'll see vivid colors in the low-vaulted ceilings...but, this feels almost dungeon-esque. Then ascend the hand-cut stone steps to the second level. It's like opening the door in Dorothy's house, and walking out into the Land of Oz! The beauty is hard to put into words...incredible...absolutely stunning...pick an adjective, and it probably fits. Each stained glass window is different, and tells a different story from the bible. There are multi-language booklets that walk you through the scenes. Spend some time, take some pictures, and enjoy."

The entrance is into the lower chapel which was for the common folk \u2013 nice enough (oldest fresco in Paris is on the left side wall near the front over the door). Up the steps (back, left) and wow. The thin, colourful columns and the ceiling (that you may not even notice) are amazing but the floor-to-ceiling stained windows on all four walls are something else. The building is long and narrow but not large. A camera with a long lens and a steady hand will reveal hundreds of detailed scenes of the Bible; Old Testament (side and rear walls) and the New Testament (front wall). (Avoid flash as it will flatten colour, photograph the windows with good sun back lighting.) Take your time and soak it up. It is a holy building so silence is required."

Acoustics are stellar, music is chosen to fit the space, all performances are intimate and all seats are good so buy the least expensive tickets since there's no significant benefit in spending more for seats closer to the performers.

Sainte Chapelle is a first among equals in this regard.Intimate yet majestic, inspiring yet charming, delicate yet insistent, this church is a must visit when you are in Paris.But I have a suggestion: see if there is an evening concert scheduled in the chapel while you are in Paris, and have and experience that is sublime and the transcendent. When music fills the lofty airs of this amazing space, you suddenly understand something about why so many worked so long and with such care on this rare gem of a gothic cathedral."

We visited the Eiffel Tower, and Notre Dame, as well as dozens of other Paris sites, but this church was by far the most beautiful with all it's stained glass windows. We we fortunate to be able to attend an early evening concert inside the church as the sun was setting. Listening to classical music while the setting sun bathed the stain glass in golden light is something I will never forget. Absolutely breathe taking. If you have a chance to take in a classical concert in this church, do it. Not only will you be able to see the side of the church with way less people after the regular crowds go home, you'll also be able to listen to classical music in a lovely setting."

Each vertical panel of stained glass holds pictures depicting events in each book of the Bible. Starting with Genesis, it wraps around the room and ends above the doors in a circular glass monument to the Apocalypse. It is truly a magnificent reminder of the beauty man is capable of when funds are unlimited. Make sure to step out on the balcony for some of the earliest depictions of God creating the earth, animals and man carved into the stone. Sainte-Chapelle is located in the Palais de Justice so security is very tight, leading to long lines that move slowly. The Museum Pass that covers the entry fee does NOT let you skip the line. In fact we were told no one can skip the line. Plan accordingly but do not miss."

Accordingly, if you're there on a hot summer day, go early.Once you make it through all that, if you're not feeling warm and fuzzy from the amazingness of Sainte-Chapelle...I won't finish the thought.This is the kind of place that even on a crowded day in late June I could feel a serene awe and lose myself for a while. I think I spent 90 minutes looking around and would have spent more if I didn't have such a crowded agenda. There are placards discreetly placed near the exit; they can help you read the windows, but I found it pretty confusing. I'd do some advance research and print out paper that you can easily use. I think that would have really enhanced my visit and is something I'll plan better next time.Message me privately if you'd like to see a photo sphere that I created..."

This is because it is in the French Administrative Complex that houses the Supreme Court, so lines are long and slow due to security. I booked VIP tickets (first come first serve for the first few rows). I did not know what would be performed, just that we needed to be there by 6:15 for 7:00 pm concert and that it would last about an hour. I thought our 11 year old son could handle an hour and if not, it was his problem since Mom deserved this. Oh my goodness gracious. I was unprepared for the magnitude of our enjoyment. First, do get there by 6:00ish since they will start moving the line on time - around 6:15 and you want to sit close if possible to see the extraordinary musicians. Our concert was Folies Barouques with violin, flute and harpsichord. It included Bach, Vivaldi, Gounod and others and two versions of Ave Maria. We could see the violinists and flutists fingers and witness up close their amazing expertise. The concert is timed so that just as they finish the sun streams through the stained glass windows. I kept telling myself that I was going to savor the moment so that later when ever in trying, boring or difficult situations, meetings etc. I would remember that time and transport myself back to that church. It was glorious. It was one of the most spiritual experiences of my life and a highlight for me of our wonderful journey to England and France. Practical tip: go to restroom prior since only one in complex and far from concert. I purchased tickets online but you may also buy them across the street in the back of the elegant caf\u00e9 on the corner. After the concert I would suggest taking a walk to the Seine, turn left and walk onto Ile Saint Louis for dinner and ice cream them back by Notre Dame by that time lit up since dark. Very safe. Catch a cab to your hotel from Notre Dame. A grand evening was had by us all, including our 11 year old son."

We passed by many times hoping to find a short line, but it regularly seemed to have a 30 minute line all day long. The Museum Pass will not let you skip the line either, but it does cover the cost of seeing the church. The church consists of a lower chapel and an upper chapel. The lower chapel features a statue of the Virgin Mary, the sanctuary's patron saint and you will also find a small gift shop dominating one side of the wall. Stairs on each side of the main entrance lead up to the Upper Chapel. The Upper Chapel is what everyone comes to see here and it is surrounded by 15 stained glass windows depicting 1,113 scenes from the Bible. Each window depicts a book from the Bible and the most prominent of these windows depicts the Passion of Christ. There is an additional window between the two stairways depicting the Apocalypse. Honestly I had a hard time making out exactly what these pictures were trying to depict, but they were beautiful nonetheless. We came in the late afternoon, but if you come in the morning I have heard that the light hitting the windows is glorious. There were ample pamphlets in English explaining the general themes of the church/windows. This is a very beautiful intimate little church and it is a must see."

We started our Paris Museum Pass here at St. Chapelle. Just bought it at the door, no hassle and no problems. Truthfully the first floor was just OK - it turns out it was for the servants to worship, but the upper floor is GORGEOUS, and that's why people come here to visit. All of the stained glasses and just a feast for the eyes.Definitely come by and see for yourself."

The stained glass is unrivaled - more colorful and pictorial than any we'd seen throughout Paris. The tile work on the floors is equally fascinating and the outside is almost as ornate as the inside. Check out the fenced area along side the exterior and you'll see gargoyles and ornamental stone work that must have fallen or been removed from the building, providing a close-up look at these architectural details."

The handheld tour guide is a must to really 'get' what is on display and to undertand the role of the people and the church then - and now."

After waiting an hour in the queue we finally made it to the main church hall downstairs which was something to behold . After admiring this for 15minutes we were ready to leave when we noticed a small stone staircase in one corner leading to another floor upstairs. Upon getting there my son was genuinely speechless seeing the most outstanding stain glass windows that we have ever witnessed. If you visit the Notre Dame cathedral, a visit to St Chappelle is mandatory or else you will miss one of the truly beautiful sights in Paris!"

There's more glass than stone in the walls, showing off Gothic architecture so well. It's amazing that the windows weren't lost in WWII. Many of them have been refurbished and (current to this writing) the latest stage of restoration is complete, revealing some real beauty. There's a long line, one you can't skip with a Paris museum pass, so be patient. Ours moved quickly enough. I can't see how you'd get much out of the chapel and it's history unless you get an audio guide. While one is available for iPhone, their 'free Wifi' wasn't working this afternoon. (Perhaps try ahead?) I couldn't listen to every window explanation - there are so many and some are hard to see as the choir area is roped off. If you're going to the Ile to see Notre Dame, add this to your time there. I'd estimate about 1 1/2 hours to include line and self-guided/audio guided tour. While I didn't specifically see 'stroller parking,' I did see a stroller parked neatly inside the lower chapel while there was a toddler upstairs, so I assume the staff helped the family park it there."

Interestingly, although it is still used as a church, the buildings surrounding it are no longer a palace. Rather, part of the court system is here, and you may see judges wandering around in robes.

My apologies to Mick and Keith, but I want to help my fellow travelers avoid a long wait for what will be a very memorable experience. Firstly, this tip will ONLY work if you already have an entry ticket as in the Paris Museum Pass (well worth the purchase, by the way). Facing the chapel you will see next door on the right the Palais de Justice. Walk north along Boulevard du Palais until you reach Quai de l'Horloge. Turn left and continue to Rue de Harlay. Take another left and continue to the back entrance to the Palais de Justice. Walk up the steps and go in passing through the metal detector. Walk straight through and out the front doors. On your right will be Sainte-Chapelle. You've just avoided the long line. Now go in the chapel and enjoy the kaleidoscope of color shining through the stained glass walls. That's right..walls! These aren't windows. They are essentially walls. The light show will be all the more spectacular if you're fortunate enough to make it there on a sunny day. No matter what it's well worth the visit."

Yes, there may be a long line (we waited for about 40 minutes) but it's really worth it.

We queued for over an hour - the problem is that they only allow around 20 people in at a time and there were several large groups arriving while we were in the queue. Once you're in, no-one hassles you to leave so you can spend as long as you like wandering round. We didn't hire an audio guide which, with hindsight, would have been a good idea. Very narrow stairs up and down to the first floor so not good if you have mobility problems. The ground floor was much better than I remembered with really vivid colours.

Like others, when I walked in, my first reaction was \"this is it?\" However, you need to make your way upstairs to see the gorgeous stained glass window. There was a huge line up when I arrived around 5pm but because of the Paris museum Pass, we were able to skip most of the line - i love the pass! If you have lots of time in Paris, I would recommend stopping by here. If you only have 3-4 day I would suggest visiting the museums first. While I would line up for D'Orsay, if I didn't have the pass, I would not have lined up in the regular line up. We spent a total of 30mins inside, which I felt was enough for me."

Whenever I hear someone is going to Paris, I tell them they must find this church! It's on the same island as Notre Dame but does not have the crowds. To me it is so much more beautiful than Notre Dame because it is smaller, more colorful, and not as dark. It has the most amazing stained glass I've ever seen. So much that it's hard to believe the church can stand. Built by King Louis IX, later to become Saint Louis. The upper chapel was only used for he and his family. This trip I purchased the audio tour and it was so worth it to really hear and understand all about this amazing chapel. So glad I went a second time and did this. It can be a bit hard to find as it is located behind the Palais de Justice which was built in front of it at some point in time. There is a sign on a building just past the huge gate of the Palais de Justice telling you this is where the line for Sainte-Chapelle is. This also means that you have to go through extra security screening of bags, etc. not because of the church itself, but because of the security for the Palais de Justice. Not a big deal, but does make the line move a bit slower. Reading other reviews I cannot believe people say it's not worth it or the price of admission. Yes, I've been in some amazing churches in Rome, Sienna, Dublin, Pisa, Venice, London, Paris just to name a few over the years. If there is a church or cathedral, I want to see it as they all have a piece of history or something beautiful be it the alter, floors, chapels, paintings, sculptures, etc. Yes, this is not as huge as St. Peter's or Notre Dame, but to realize the stained glass tells the stories of the Old and New Testament running up and down the length of each of these stained glass panels...amazing! Honestly, if you want to go in and out quickly just to say you went, if you only have 1 day in Paris, or if you have small children with you and will be distracted, don't bother. Read the history of this place and I think you will agree it's worth your time."

I've been a few times and it is beautiful in all kinds of light. If you can, go at sunset....heartbreakingly beautiful play of light through the colored slivers of glass. Allow at least an hour.

My wife and I had never attended a classical concert before and we were delighted with the music and the setting. La Sainte Chapelle is a 13th. Century chapel sourounded by court buildings. You have to go through these areas to get to the chapel. However, once you are inside you are met by huge stain glass windows and beautiful architecture. We passed the chapel a day earlier and saw people lined up by the hundreds to get a look inside. The concert consisted of three violinists, a cello, and a harpsichord. The program was Vilvaldi's The Four Seasons. We were lucky enough to be seated in the Vip section (five rows back) because the musicians played off each other, sometimes funny and sometimes seriously. Their expressions at points were priceless. The building seemed as if it was meant for this music. I highly recommend you give this a try. One note of caution. If you just want to visit the chapel several people told us that they waited on line for a couple of hours before they got in. Frank44d"

However, at least during the summer months, the wait to get in is way too long. We struck gold when we found out that there are concerts in the evening, after the normal viewing hours. We heard a 7 piece string plus harpsicord concert of Bach violin concerto and Mozart's Eine kleine Nachtmusik,sitting comfortably in the magnificent upstairs chapel. The acoustics were very good, as were the musicians and of course sitting there surrounded by the early evening light flooding through the stained glass windows is magical. Getting tickets online was easy, though it did cost about 9 euro more, and we needed to have a way to print them out. You can also get tickets at several of the large department stores until the day before the performance, and some people even bought on site, though I would not have chanced that for fear of a sold out room. Sainte Chapelle is after all not that large.The only thing you do lose out on if you visit as part of a concert is the lower floor, which I also love, though the upper floor is the well known and loved view"

The downside is that the audio-guide is hard to follow sometimes because the track number and the item you're looking at number are sometimes hard to coordinate. Another con is that if you've got some mobility issues, the stairs are steep and dark and challenging. If you are pressed for time, skip this and go another day because sometimes the lines are crazy long. I've been here several times and it's pretty amazing."

The program was Vivaldi's Four Seasons and the musicians were excellent and amusing. The playing was intense and very good and the interaction of the musicians was terrific. The evening sun came through the stained glass windows in a myriad of colors. Unfortunately, we did not have time to return for a daytime visit to the chapel. No one should miss a visit to Saint-Chapelle and, if possible, attend a concert there. (It is advisable to purchase tickets online in advance to ensure availability of seating.)"

It is not just another huge Gothic Cathedral with a very tall nave. Saint Chapelle is not as big as Westminster Abbey. When you walk into the interior, all you see are dramatic floor-to-ceiling stained glass. The impression I had is that the supporting stone pillars visually disappear. The visitor is bathed in colorful light streaming in from the windows. Stories from the Old Testament, New Testament and the Life of Christ are portrayed in the stained glass."

Once you are in the upper chapel, there is a stack of guide cards (sitting on a stand in the corner) in various languages that you can pick up and walk around with to tell you more about each window. Sainte-Chapelle typically has very long lines. The first line at the street is only a security line. There is a second line inside security to purchase tickets and then go in. If you can purchase tickets in advance or use a museum pass, this will speed up your visit. You will still have to wait for security, but once past security, you will be able to skip the second line for tickets and go into the church."

There is so much of it, and all of it so beautiful, that it would take forever to look at and absorb it all. We visited with our two teens and they enjoyed it as well. We'd talked in advance about some of the biblical stories depicted in the windows, and it was fun for them to find Moses, Jesus, and some of the other people depicted. We arrived at the chapel just a few minutes before its opening time of 9:30. There was already a line to the golden Palace of Justice gate, and it took us about 20 minutes to get through the security check. The line had gotten even longer by the time we exited, so I would recommend coming as early as possible. Once through security, you walk around the outside of the chapel to the entrance (separate lines for Museum Pass holders vs. those that need to purchase). It's interesting to look at the foundation of the church as you walk and see how much the ground level has risen since it was built. Once in the church, we pretty much went straight upstairs to the Haute Chapel. The lower one is pretty but no comparison to the upper. We spent about 30 minutes looking at the glass, taking pictures, and enjoying the light. You can also exit under the rose window to see some of the exterior decorations. I love this church and make a point of visiting every time I'm in Paris."

This is without question the most beautiful display of stained glass we've ever seen, and we wouldn't think of coming to Paris without seeing it again. After our first trip seven years ago, restoration work began, and on two subsequent trips, one side or the other was covered up. This year we still expected the rose window to be behind scaffolding but we were pleasantly surprised to find everything clear. Whenever we visit we're always amazed again how brilliant the colorful display is. A lot of people like to see it on a sunny day, but for our money a bright, but overcast day works best since all the windows glow equally. Bring your wide angle lens and don't forget to bring your patience. This place is always crowded.A lot of people are put off by the line outside. Security is especially tight here, and even with the museum pass you have to stand in line for screening. It moves pretty quickly, so don't let it get to you. But, if you don't have the museum pass, you'll face a second line inside to buy tickets. The pass will save you 15 or 20 minutes of line-standing. Don't get sidetracked by the lower chapel when you first enter. Hurry on upstairs. You can see the lower chapel before you leave."

As you enter it seems very small after just walking through Notre Dame. The ceiling seems low and just seems like a waste of time until you go up the spiral staircase. You feel like you have just walked into a jewel box. It is breath taking as you are surrounded by stained glass windows that are right there within reach. If you have the Paris Museum Pass you skip the line and go right in."

The entrance is the former servants space, which in itself is stunning...but climb those spiral stairs and you are awe-struck. Three walls of stained glass, containing the stories of the bible. On a sunny day, it's indescribable. Don't overlook the details of the door locks or wood carvings. While they are adornments, they are just as magnificent. Be sure to look for the concert schedules here. Hearing Vivaldi here is like nothing on earth."

It's also strategically located close to the Notre Dame, so you can do them both in a relatively short time.However, the staff of the place really underestimate the volume of people the church can handle, so they overrestrict the crowd, making for gigantic lines. I was there in March and waited for over an hour in the rain (don't forget your umbrella!), imagine what it's like in the summer July sun when the line is probably twice as long.Anyway, even when you brave the line and enter, the entrance itself is very awkward. It's basically a courtyard with many huge garbage containers. It stinks a bit, and is generally unpleasant.The church itself is known for its beautiful vitrages (glass), and it's indeed quite something. However, it's fairly small and there isn't much to do there beyond ~15 minutes. If you come here and notice the line is very short, go ahead. If not, I recommend skipping this place."

Mostly it's the glass that makes the space worth visiting, but it also has the oldest surviving mural in Paris and some excellent bas-relief carvings. A must-see for history buffs, especially ones interested in the history of the Catholic church. and these is also a decent souvenir shop, complete with little Quasimodo figurines (wrong church, but close enough!)."

While the downstairs is relatively simple, you ascent a narrow stone stairway to the magnificent upstairs flooded with light through wall to wall stained glass windows. The starry ceiling is magical. While a relatively small church compared to something like Notre Dame, it packs a real punch visually. Well worth the wait in line to get in. Due to the size and the staircase, they need to control the entry to limit the number of people inside at any one time."

There is a lengthy security line to get in, as the building is within the Palace of Justice. We had planned on buying our museum passes here, thinking it would be less of an ordeal than at the Louvre or Orsay. Wrong. It took us 45 minutes to get through the security line. The chapel itself is small and underwhelming. The stained glass is about 1/3 obscured by a building that buts up against the chapel. The glass itself may have been fantastic for the time, but just seems adequate now. Half of the chapel seems like a souvenir shop. The Concergerie, where prisoners awaited execution next door, is more interesting in my opinion."

There was a bit of a line to get in, maybe 20 minutes or so, and they'd been closed for a few hours earlier that day. If I'd been on a tight schedule, I might not have been able to visit with the unannounced closing (not on the website that morning) and the line. As it was, I ended up in conversation with a lovely Canadian family so the time passed quickly.The church was beautiful, but there was some renovation work going on that limited access to parts of the church and its exterior. I know renovations have to be done, but that's always a bummer to me. Also, the steps might be a bit hard for people with disabilities yo navigate. It was a sunny day, so the stained glass was at its most magnificent. They also controlled the number of people allowed inside at a time, and that helped give everyone space to view and photograph without being so crowded. I didn't get an audio guide & don't recall if there was one offered, but I regret that I didn't have one. If you have a choice, always get the audio guide. It's worth a few extra euros. I did not care for the way the boutique was arranged at the church, but that is a personal preference. Long story short - go see this beautiful stained glass; it's one of the most beautiful examples of stained glass I've seen anywhere in the world."

And indeed Sainte-Chapelle lived up to its billing. It's a fabulous building, and the stained glass is, as advertised, breathtaking.

I first visited Sainte-Chapelle many years ago and couldn't wait to take my family. Rather than fighting the hoards, I purchased tickets to an evening concert. Although a tourist concert, it was quite good and provided the opportunity to enjoy the beauty and the serenity that Sainte Chapelle is meant to have. We had an hour to sit quietly and absorb the light and color of the chapel with a background of Handel and Vivaldi. No one should visit Paris without seeing Sainte Chapelle."

Located by the side of the Palais du Justice, visitors undergo stringent security check before being permitted to enter this building with its soaring stained glass panels in the upper chapel. You should coordinate visiting this gem with the one to the Cathedral of Notre Dame, which is located in the square opposite but hidden from view by the Police headquarters. The relics of the crown of thorns and the cross, earlier housed in the Cathedral are now kept here. They are open to public view once a week and on certain festive days."

To avoid too much standing in line for the Sainte Chapelle we opted to prebuy tickets to a 7pm concert followed by dinner nearby. We liked this option as we turned up as the city was quieting down, we arrived early enough to be near front of line (seats are first in, first seated, depending on section you buy), quick through security and up to chapel. Concert was professional and displayed great violin playing skills. And we had plenty of time to view and photograph splendid stained glass windows before and after concert. Light was great at this time of day too. Recommended."

From the outside, it is another stately old Paris church, of which there is no scarcity. On entering, one sees a bunch of well-preserved stained glass windows, half of which are hidden by a bunch of booths selling tchotchkes. Nothing prepares you for what is to come. You go up a spiral stone staircase, and enter this astoundng place. Soaring gothic ceilings (around 90 feet high) are held up by a few thin stone columns. The ENTIRE remaining space, floor to ceiling, consists of stained glass, illustrating in numerous panels the entire bible!! A truly jaw-dropping, beautiful sight, which puts every other church I have seen in Europe in the shade. Almost everyone goes to Notre Dame. This is a few steps away, and a shame to miss!!!!"

You should go in the late afternoon as the sun will be shining on the windows and it looks brilliant and the definition is fantastic. Please remember that this church was built in the 1200's. We had a line and even with the museum pass we had to wait. We waited for 1 hour and I thought my husband would want to bail as it was the end of the day before getting cleaned up for dinner. Afterwards he was thrilled that we had seen the glass. We both thought it was well worth it. One of the nice things for us is that we chose a hotel on the Ile Saint Louis and we just a few minute walk back. The line is on a tree lined street so you are in the shade as you are waiting."

You still have to stand in line as you have to pass through security, but you don't have to wait for the person in front of you to purchase their ticket (you are in the courtyard of the Justice Center?) We went there later in the day, and it didn't take long to get in. When you enter the chapel on the first level, you are wowed by the ceiling - the most beautiful blue and gold. The stained glass is beautiful in here, as is the rest of the chapel. But, ascend the small staircase and prepare to be overwhelmed by the most beautiful panels of stained glass you've ever seen. Be sure to get an oversized laminated card (free to use) with the description of each panel in the chapel. Each panel depicts a different book of the Bible. Even for a non-religious person like me, it is really moving. Do not miss this while in Paris. TIP: If you are in Paris for a few days, get the Paris Museum Pass - you really do get into places quicker. Be sure to get in lines for Passes (most places have separate lines)."

On a sunny day, the place is even better in the late afternoon than in the morning.On somewhat of a sidelight, Louis IX; \"St. Louis\", who build this place, might be one of the more overrated kings in French history. He was corrupt. He was a virulent anti-Semite, who burned copies of the Talmud and persecuted mightily the Jews of Paris. However, the Pope loved him because he gave LOTS of money to the Church, and thus his sainthood. But as a legacy, he couldn't do better than this, his private chapel.

After going through the Notre Dame Cathedral we found this church/museum to be light and bright with the most beautiful stained glass windows. We were disappointed that they had many pamphlets in different languages, but none available in English. They have a whole section of the church designated as a gift shops that were quite pricey. I guess it would have been worth having a museum pass to avoid some of the long lines at these venues."

Her sense of awe was exactly what I experienced in my recent visit. There is no other place like it. A drawback is the large crowds that throng to it. A suggestion: there are frequent chamber music concerts in the evening. We went to a concert of Mozart and Schubert. The combination of the music and the venue were incredible."

Be sure to either use the recordings, or for a shorter tour, grab one of the laminated cards by the upstairs exit (not sure why they are placed there) to get more out of your window viewing. The first floor is a little underwhelming, but the tour explains that this area was the worship space for the servants and the poor. The second floor is really what you are visiting to see. You will have to walk up a narrow stair to it, so be advised. This is where the royalty worshiped. I wish we had gone to an evening concert, as I am sure they must be magical. Next time!

We were given options of which type of seats we wanted - we opted for the cheap seats in the back as you don't really need to see the performers for a music concert.The church was beautiful - gorgeous stained glass windows.

Yes, there are a couple of lines to wait, but so what.The space is truly incredible. We felt so fortunate to enjoy lovely, classical music while watching the sunlight dance and dim across the stained glass as the evening progressed. The musicians, and opera singer, were very good an friendly -- They greeted their \"guests\" as we left for the evening. I can not recommend this highly enough."

Come to Sainte-Chappelle instead ... you can miss it from the outside, grubby and nondescript, but inside... oh, inside! One enters at the lower level, the level of the less important worshippers, which is lovely in itself, all painted and decorated walls. But once you climb the little spiral stair to St Louis's dream - oh! The world is made of light. It's a miracle today - imagine yourself in the Middle Ages, seeing something like this, walls seemingly all of glass, a rainbow of jewels, a ceiling arched to heaven. Utterly gorgeous."

Parisian friends tell me that the best way to see this is to get tickets to a concert or to try to get a reserved-entry ticket with set time, but warn that they've heard that the wait time to get in can be an hour or more even for reserved entry tickets. Wait time for entry was over three hours during each of the several times we passed by during our latest visit at the end of May, so we ended up skipping this sight in favor of other attractions where the wait time was shorter."

This is a beautiful little chapel built by Louis 9 (later St. Louis) to house the Crown of Thorns (which cost him three times as much to buy as the chapel cost to build!) You go to Sainte Chapelle to admire the spectacular stained-glass as there is almost nothing else in the chapel. It is worth buying the audio tour which explains what is depicted in the panels of stained-glass (which are upstairs and downstairs.) If you don't do this, then you are simply looking at pretty windows for 10 minutes and leaving. It is a good idea to get there about one half hour before the chapel opens (it opens at 9:30 a.m so be sure to be standing on line by 9 a.m.) The reason for this is that there is always a line and it moves slooooowly, since you have to go through a security checkpoint before going into the chapel. The entrance to the chapel is shared with the Palais du Justice (the French equivalent of the Court of Appeals) so security is tight. If you go to the chapel later in the day you will wait that much longer, perhaps up to an hour, and it is a hot wait in the summertime."

However as we were leaving we saw there was a concert on that night and bought two tickets at 30\u20ac each. The program was an assortment of popular pieces which would have been fine if they had been played properly (things are usually popular because they are beautiful - I'm not a snob) but the trio of a harpsichord, violin and flute were often very out of time with each other and sometimes even a bit out of tune. The concert lasted 50 minutes, just about an hour after the encore. I felt the musicians had no respect for their audience or for the music. I suspect that many people in the audience were not regular concert goers because there was lots of very undeserved applause. A rip-off."

When you exit the narrow, winding stairs you are surely treated to the most airy, colorful chapel that exist. The King built this Chapel to house a portion of Christ Crown-of- Thorns and the stained glass used in it's construction is breath-taking. It is almost as if the glass is floating. So much of the architecture of the the 13th century was heavy and bulky, but not this church. Definitely worth a visit."

So many tourist sights are hyped, but it's impossible to hype Sainte-Chapelle, which is one of the most beautiful churches on earth & certainly one of the 3 or 4 most beautiful sites in Paris -- all the more so since the stained glass windows for which it's famous have been painstakingly renovated; after 7 years of work, they're now on view. Two tips: first, go when it's sunny because the sunlight makes all the difference; second, be prepared to wait 45 minutes to an hour to get in because it's one of the top spots in Paris, along with the Louvre & the chateau de Versailles. But on a bright sunny day, it's worth it, with the light streaming in & creating a dazzling effect, like being inside a jewel box. You can get a ticket just for the chapel or for the chapel + the Conciergerie; I'd recommend the latter if you have the time; the Conciergerie isn't beautiful like Sainte-Chapelle, but it's fascinating & well worth an hour of your time to see the prison where 3,000 people were executed in the Terror during the French Revolution, including Marie-Antoinette. Best time to go: mid-to-late morning, between 10 a.m. to noon, or else evening, after 4 p.m. Both the Conciergerie & Sainte Chapelle have nice gift shops."

My highlight was a concert of Bach on unaccompanied cello. That music in that ambiance was unearthly - a heavenly feast for the ears and eyes. During my visits over the years, there has always been scaffolding up in various parts of the chapel. Now that the restoration is complete, the result is magnificent. The gorgeous blues and reds fill the interior with a wondrous light. My favourite practice is to take people there. I ask them to close their eyes before emerging into the upper chapel, all the while guiding them. Then I tell them to open their eyes. The gasps of wonder are worth it every time."

Lovely ground floor area, but then go up the stairs and be blown away by the beauty of these amazing ceilings. We forgot out binoculars which would be a great help to see and 'read' the bible stories in the glass. We are non believers anf loved it, I'm sure those with Christian faith would gain even more from a visit. And when we left mid morning there was no queue at all!"

As it turned out, it was for string ensemble playing Vivaldi. The procedure to get us all into the church was very drawn out; first security check for everyone then wait, then walk upstairs and wait and finally into the top level of Saint Chapelle. The cellist was running late so there was more waiting after that. I have to admit I had booked the concert for DH's enjoyment and I was just along for the ride but I actually really enjoyed it. Of course, the stained glass was just as amazing as the first time we visited."

My friend Annie and I went to Saint-Chapelle (Cit\u00e9 metro station) and waited an hour in line before getting our tickets and being admitted-there is always a long line and getting through security takes time. Also, due to the limited space, there seems to be some timing control at the entrance. As we slowly moved up to the front of the line, we saw a sign explaining that the ticket office closes for lunch! Not sure if this happens every day at 12:30 pm. Our visit was in late March, before the busy tourist season.The lower level space is being renovated so about half of it is closed off, but you still get to see the ceilings and the altar space. Be sure, after you walk up the spiral stone stairs, to pick up a plastic covered guide to the stained glass windows; it is quite helpful to understanding which panels depict which scenes from the Bible.I highly recommend reserving tickets to a classical concert at Saint-Chapelle. My husband and I attended one on a Sunday evening at 7 pm. You can choose a more expensive option and have reserved seating in rows 3-10, which for 20 euros, was well worth it. We heard Pachelbel's Canon and then Four Seasons played by a wonderful French string ensemble. Tickets may be purchased (and printed out) here:http://www.classictic.com/en/special/concerts-in-la-sainte-chapelle/216/Sainte-Chapelle is a beautiful cath\u00e9drale."

I went to a concert at Sainte-Chapelle on a whim with my wife at Christmas. We've walked past it dozens of times before and didn't even know it was there. We thought the lineups outside were for court cases. The concert was in the evening and only seated 150 people. After entering the courtyard entrance and clearing security we were led to and fro through the courtyard, past courtrooms then into a tunnel and up some stairs to the chapel encased within the court's building. When we entered the chapel I was stunned to see the towering, semi-circular stained glass windows curving up to a point above our heads. Some of the glass dates back to the 1200's. At night, with the lights and candles it was absolutely the most beautiful sight I had ever seen. We had arrived in Paris just hours before the concert. While listening to Pachelbel's Canon and Vivaldi's Four Seasons in the spectacular venue I was brought to tears. And that isn't easy! After the concert I said to my wife as we wended our way back out to the street, \" I could go straight back out to the airport and fly home tonight because It won't get any better than that\". And it didn't. Go!"

Once inside, we stayed for ~20 minutes. We didn't have a guide, and that was more than enough time to experience the magnificence of Sainte-Chapelle's stained glass. (It was late in the day, and we were trying to make it next door to Le Conciergerie before it closed for the day.) There are large handheld placards available inside in multiple languages that will explain how the windows are arranged, and walk you through the \"story\" they are telling. When you walk into the Church, you actually enter through the gift shop. Make sure you go up the stairs directly to your left (past the available audioguides- extra 5 Euro?), to enter the main church. Once inside, it's actually pretty small- but tall.

We traveled with a handicapped person and were unable to communicate the need for handicapped entrance to the security guards but once they saw our difficulty, our passage was eased through this check point and there was a bench where our companion could wait nearby. There was no sign for handicapped entrance at the ticket office, but we eventual realized our companion could sit near the entrance while we waited through the line. Once there, the lower level chapel is worth the look, but the entry to the upper level is via the traditional stone staircases that wind up and only have a handrail on one side (this made the visit upstairs impossible for our one usable-armed guest).For non-handicapped visitors, the chapel upstairs is very beautiful and holds concerts with folding chairs (we didn't attend one) but those chairs are removed during visiting hours.The bathrooms are at the exit gate (which is also the entrance for handicapped visitors) but most were closed except the handicapped bathroom and so there was a lengthy line for its use."

Expect long queue getting in... queue is because of some security checks, similar to airport where you will need to empty your pockets and have your bag scanned. However, the guards didn't appear to be looking at the scanning monitor - they were happily chatting among themselves, kind of wonder what's the purpose of the security check (?!)So weird way to start the visit; once passed the security, you will walk in the big courtyard towards the chapel. Just as noted by the brochure/website - the chapel consists of two levels... ground level is not too impressive; the walls look really old as in not being restored in anyway... but don't get put off.Going up to the next level.... as soon as you walk in - WOW!! The chapel looks simply amazing - it lits up because of the sun light coming through the stained glass. There are some (limited) chairs to sit down and enjoy the view of the stained glass panels.If you didn't hire the audio guide, be sure to look out for the thick plasticised info which give some brief info about the stained glass.If I knew better, I would had packed a pair of binocular or some sort to get a better look at the glass panels.Wheelchair access is possible to the top floor, ask the staffs for help - they will accompany you to the lift access.** 5-star for the staffs who helped us."

One to get past security (since the entrance also serves for some government buildings), then another line to get to the church. Sometimes these lines can get rough to wait in from what I hear. We probably waiting in total an hour or so. But we got lucky because the day we showed up they were allowing free entrance at night. That is why we had to wait a bit longer.

The first floor has a very fun virtual tour machine that allows you to experience the chapel as it was hundreds of years ago, tilting and zooming the display as you move from site to site. Be warned: the museum pass does not get you past the security line which can take up to 1 hour as it's the same entrance for the courthouse attached to the chapel."

This is not a large church or cathedral, so being able to see it without crowds was amazing. The first floor sets the stage for the chapel upstairs and the audio guide gives background to the visitor. Then follow the spiral staircase to the chapel and be prepared to gasp in amazement!

Unbelievably there were also stalls selling souvenirs, taking up one side of the chapel, with traders happy to discuss the transactions.

It is inside the Palace of Justice complex, so not visible from the street, and it's not much to look at from the outside anyway, but that plain exterior hides one of the most beautiful, richly-decorated spaces in the world. Every inch of the interior is ornamented - painted, carved, or made out of stained glass. There are guide cards available (for free) in multiple languages to help you \"read\" the enormous stained glass windows, but you don't need a guide to appreciate the overwhelming beauty of the space. There is an entrance fee now (8 euro for non-students I think), to support the foundation that maintains and protects the building, and you do have to go through some metal detectors because it is inside a government complex. It is well worth it!"

You see it, you take pictures, you maybe sit down & read the info sheet that describes the stained glass, & then you leave--there's nothing else to do or see. You can buy an audio guide for \u20ac4,5 but we didn't. Overall, the chapel is spectacular but the experience is rather underwhelming.

Then you go through security and are put out into a courtyard to find your way to the church, which is in the middle of the courtyard. But the church is simple on the outside (meaningful) which means it doesnt stand out from other buildings. Once inside there is a nice fresco room that is also the gift shop. Then you climb a tiny stone spiral staircase in the corner of the room to the second floor and enter the main room with the majestic and famous stained glass. The glass is amazing and if you hold still and take it all in, it made me feel like I was in a kaleidoscope. The room is relatively short though and is not a big church like other tourist trap ones. I would have enjoyed it more if it was dusted. There was a thick and hard to miss coat of dust on everything. This then hid the colors of the wall carvings and sculptures. The place isnt that big and shouldnt be that expensive to keep dusted. Outside they had stones and things piled up, so it looks like they may be doing some construction, but it also could just be cluttered storage. This felt like a forgotten church that was falling into disrepair. I'm glad I saw it as the stained glass was worth it and it didnt cost us anything since we had the Museum Pass, but I hope it comes under new management or something happens and they clean it up some to help preserve the highly ornate inside."

The place was packed inside with, I'd say, close to 300 people all jostling to get a view of the stained glass windows in this tiny chapel. You can't see them as there is always someone crossing in front of you, bumping you from behind or sticking a selfie stick in your face. My advice, open longer, don't let pre-pays jump the queue, manage the numbers in the building so that people have a chance to really take in the building"

This is all stained glass.When you enter from the lower chapel, your entire sight is of walls of stained glass. All the walls are just glass. You see Adam & Eve, Moses, the flood, etc.The rose window with apocalyptic images is overwhelming . Any of us could recognize a \" horned\" Moses or beheaded Baptizer, but the images here are harder. The palette lighter with mild greens and subtler blues.If you want size, buttresses, gargoyles, ribbed vaults, capacity, then go elsewhere . Notre Dame is just down the street.

If traveling to Paris, this is certainly in the top 5 must see attractions. Not easy to find, not easy to get into, but the challenges are worth it. Once inside the sanctuary, you will have a sense of peace and pure bliss through the play of lights through some of the most beautiful stained glass in the world. The entry fee is nominal, the time allowed to enjoy is unlimited and your future Chapel visits will always pale by comparison. Absolutely the one to see, savor and enjoy.Cheers and happy travels."

So be sure to pay a visit duringthe day.However, if you have the opportunity to attend a concert here in the evening, do not miss it! The acoustics are fantastic for a string quartet or quintet. We were fortunate to hear a very talented quartet play Vivaldi's Four Seasons. What a lovely ( and inexpensive ) way to spend an evening in Paris!"

It has the most stunning vaulted ceiling in deep blue and gold. Every time I see it, it takes my breath away. The first floor, or upper chapel, is more like a conventional church. Again, the decorated walls and ceiling are beautiful. But the 15 stained glass windows are spectacular and tell wide range of bible stories ranging fron Genesis, through the book of Job to the book ok Kings. It is great fun trying to spot the individual stories - take some binoculars if you are really interested as the windows are very tall.Sadly, the wall paintings are not in great state of repair in places.Overall, very well worth a visit. Try to get tickets online as the queues get very long."

However the experience of the evening was overshadowed by the extremely bad organisation of the event. Due to the fact that there has been only 1(!) security gate (at one of the most wellknown highlights of Paris) for hundreds of people queueing up the one hour lasting concert started with 50 minutes delay. Some people were leaving due to that delay. You better do not plan a timed date after the concert. Due to the very bad organisation of the seating (even in what they call the VIP area) and the disinterest and ignorance of the staff couples and groups could not sit together; we saw one couple leaving due to that. The biggest imposition however was that it has not been allowed to use any toilet before, during and after the concert. 300+ people many of which elder were not allowed to use the visible and close toilets!!! Over a period which lastet nearly 2.5 hours due to the late beginning. Despite various efforts with different members of the staff the use of toilets has been refused. Experienced travellers do not have high expectations regarding the customer orientation, friendliness and quality of France; but this bad experience topped many others. It was a shame not only for the customers but very much so also for the fantastic artists who had to suffer from the bad mood of the visitors as a result of the extremely bad organisation."

I've been to Paris several times, but this is the first time I saw Saint-Chapelle. What was I thinking? If you love architecture and history, Saint-Chapelle should be right at the top of your list of things to do in Paris.In terms of sheer beauty - it is exquisite. As you enter the royal chapel from the staircase from the ground floor you step into a soaring nave made of walls of stained glass, and decorated above by a field of gold stars on a vaulted ceiling.The chapel is itself a reliquary built to house one of the most significant relics in Christendom - the Crown of Thorns. Saint-Chapelle was commissioned and built by King Louis IX of France to house his precious relic which he purportedly purchased at a price that was more than three times the cost to build the chapel itself. Among the scenes depicted in the stained glass is one of King Louis IX receiving the crown of thorns - very significant! Images and carvings of the crown are abundant throughout the chapel. Note that the crown of thorns which Louis IX purchased is no longer housed at Sainte-Chapelle, but at nearby Notre-Dame Cathedral.TIPS: Saint-Chapelle is open every day of the week (except some holidays like Christmas) including Mondays and Tuesdays, days when a number of major museums are closed in Paris.While I was there I noticed that there was a concert (Vivaldi's 'Four Seasons') scheduled that evening. I can't imagine a more incredible place to hear a concert. Worth checking out before you go."

We could not have divined that this frail Gothic mini-cathedral that the devout Louis IX--Saint Louis--built in the 13th Century as the chapel for his long-gone palace could survived weather, wars and a revolution. There's more stained glass here, 6,458 square feet of it in the richest red, blue and yellows, than pillars and walls, Most is cut into such small slivers recounting biblical narratives that it seems woven of Belgian lace. We paid about $14 each for that."

I was inside for roughly 20-30 minutes, and it was very close to other famous Parisian landmarks."

There are many languages available to listen to. When we went upstairs the site was breathtaking. The glass is overwhelming. The room tells the story of the entire Bible with stained glass. The audio tour got confusing at this point and I did turn it off because I got lost in the view. If I ever return to Paris I will come here again."

The queue to get in takes a long time as they let in a few at a time for security checks and there are also coaches of Chinese tourists that get to skip the line and go straight in which makes the queue take a lot longer. Make sure you read how much it is to get in, as if like us you are and EU resident and are under 25 then you get in for free which is very handy. Once you are in it is clear that a lot of maintenance work is ongoing however when you\u2019re visiting an attraction as old as this is to be expected that there will always be some restoration work ongoing. The windows are beautiful and when you walk in you really get that \u2018wow\u2019 moment so definitely give it a visit."

This chapel, commissioned by King Louis IX of France, was consecrated April 26, 1248.It was once the home of \"Christ's Relics,\" including the crown of thorns. One of the most impressive features is the huge stained glass windows on the second floor, which in addition to paying homage to King Louis for relocating Christ's Relics to Paris, illustrate various portions of the old and new testament.While the chapel has largely been recreated due to damage suffered during the French Revolution - two thirds of the stained glass is authentic. Whether you go to see the gothic architecture or bask in the colorful glow of the stained glass on the second floor this is a worthy pilgrimage.I do suggest reviewing the warnings on the Sainte Chappelle website. Thorough bag checks are performed before allowing entry. Be sure not to be carrying any restricted items to avoid being turned away.Check the Sainte-Chapelle Website for pricing and hours of operation.Photos from my visit can be viewed by visiting http://www.acevedophoto.net/Portfolio/The-World/Paris.

It's worth trying to arrive half an hour before opening as a queue had already formed when I went 15 minutes early the last time I visited. Numbers inside are kept at a comfortable level and as you need to look up to see the windows, it's one of the attractions where a crowd does not really get in the way. However, I found the guard at the entrance to be rude and brusk, closing 15 minutes before the last entry time printed on the sign and without really any explanation. When people in the queue tried to query him he simply waved his hand in their faces repeating that it was now closed. His unapologetic attitude and rude behaviour certainly lived up to the stereotype many tourists have of the French. (*the other two spaces are the Lady and the Unicorn tapestry gallery in the Mus\u00e9e de Cluny, and the galleries housing Les Nymph\u00e9as by Claude Monet at Mus\u00e9e de l'Orangerie)"

It makes me wonder if these people bothered to go upstairs to Chapelle Haute, where you see the breathtaking stained glass windows from pictures. Yes, it's true: Saint-Chapelle is divided into a lower chapel and then an upper chapel. If you only visit the lower chapel, you may feel cheated for having waited in line for so long, as it's somewhat dull and not at all what you might've seen from pictures. However, there's a spiral staircase tucked into a corner by the entrance. Ascend these stairs, and then your mind will be blown. I literally stopped breathing when I saw the stained glass windows in the upper level. They are breathtaking. No words can adequately describe how stunning they are. You will be dazzled. I spent over an hour in the upper chapel because I simply didn't want to leave! There are chairs in the chapel where you can sit and drink in the beauty of the place. Be sure to pick up one of the laminated indexes in the back which tell you all about the chapel and the stories in the stained glass windows. This is one place you do not want to miss!P.S. Avoid the long lines by instead purchasing your ticket for Sainte-Chapelle from the Conciergerie next door. Once you do, you can actually go to the front of the Sainte-Chapelle line."

Stuck in the middle of a large police station complex (the Palais de la Citie), it is a breath-taking sweep of stained glass that makes you feel as if you're living inside a universe of color and light. To get to it, you have to go through a metal detector, so leave your pocket knives back in your hotel. Once you're inside you'll feel as if you've drifted back in time, and if you're like me, you won't want to leave. I missed Sainte-Chapelle the first 3 times I went to Paris because you can't really see it from the street, but it's well worth the trip."

The queue opens again at 2.15pm after lunch break. Gotta love the French lunch tradition!Anyway, this meant that by the time we got into the building and other tourists raced through to their next adventure, we virtually had the chapel to ourselves to enjoy the amazing stained glass panels in sparkling midday sun. As with most attractions, well worth getting the audio guide to explain all the history and detail of the artworks here, although there was some printed info in various languages inside the chapel.Also if you have time, duck into the Palace of Justice next door on your way out. No additional charge or security queues, but a spectacular building and you can see French justice system in action! Remarkable."

I can only repeat all of the glowing reviews of the beauty of this small chapel and its magnificent stained glass windows in the upper chamber. But my most memorable experiences have been the unique concerts that are held here. Depending on the time of year, these often occur just around dusk when the beauty of the chapel turns from bright to dim in the fading light from the stained glass windows. Large church candles set throughout the chapel then bring out the true character of the setting. My absolute favorite concerts are Vivaldi's Four Seasons performed by Les Violons de France, the violin orchestra of France. Concerts are performed frequently in this magnificent setting and if you're in Paris when one is available and fail to take advantage of the opportunity, you will have missed one of life's most memorable events! My favorite site for finding available concerts here is classictic.com. Just search there for \"Sainte-Chapelle Concerts\"."

We went inside and were still wondering why this place was so highly rated, but then we went upstairs. Oh my, there are no words to explain the awesomeness of the stained glass in this church. It is beyond belief, we stood there for quite a while in in awe of it. The stained glass goes through pretty much every story of the Bible and it was really fun to figure out what each piece represents. We probably spent about an hour just looking around at the glass in this church.Also, they have official shushers. So when things get a little loud, which is often, someone shushes them. Can't decide if I would like that job or not, or if I even possessed the required shushing skill sets to even obtain a job of that sort.Saint-Chapelle was by far the biggest surprise I have ever had when not knowing what to expect inside of a building.

It is 5.20pm, and happy I am able to make it, when an UNBEARABLE and IMPOLITE member of the staff start saying (should say scream?) FERME FERME (or how you spell it!)... \"the museum is closed...\". Now, first: you have a board along the queue that says \"last entry 5.30\" (picture attached!). You stop people 10 minutes before that could have clearly had the chance to enter by the fixed last entry time. And, second, you do it screaming and raising hands in hair doing the typical gesture used to send people away. That is frankly a TERRIBLE way to treat tourists that are paying to come to see your place and should be treated as host specially if they have been queuing for a while and they should still have the right to enter as it was NOT closing time.I am sorry that a beautiful place like this (where I had to come the day after!!!!) is connected to such a bad memory.

The only downside for us was that restoration work was in progress which limited the full impact of the experience..but when you see it you will understand why the restoration is so vital."

Dating back to the mid 13th century - originally built as a chapel to hold Relics - the distinguishing feature of course are the amazing windows which surround the chapel with bible stories arranged in 12 groups. The walk up the narrow winding staircase does not prepare you for the amazing beauty of these windows. The lines can be long - not very well marked the individual admission is on the right. Don't get caught up in the group reservation line on the left which often merges with the individual line in a chaotic mess. Also the Sainte-Chapelle line in right next to the door for the Palace of Justice and many people initially got into the wrong line. Also BEWARE of the long lunch hour closure so be sure to check the schedule. Small admission fee - the wait might be longer than the visit."

You have to go through a lineup, metal detectors, and a fairly high entry fee to get to it but it's worth it in my opinion. When you first enter you're actually in the 'basement' where the gift shop is so you have to take an immediate left up the staircase to get to the actual main room (we were thinking \"Is this it?!\" before we figured it out). To be honest I was a bit underwhelmed at first by the small size of the place, having just come from Notre Dame, but the more I looked up at those windows and came to realize the stories they were telling the more amazed I was. A very special place though I'd think 30 minutes inside would be enough."

The lower chapel which was for 'commoners' is also worth looking around."

As a wheelchair user, you approach the front of the queue and an attendant will take you through the security entrance for the nearby Palais de Justice in order to more easily access Sainte-Chapelle (there was a step into this area which security will help you with). As with most of the museums in Paris, wheelchair users plus a companion receive free entry. Once you've been taken around houses to get to the chapel itself, it really is like being inside a beautiful and most colourful jewel with 15 panels of stained glass detailing the old testament as well as Louis XIV's acquisition of the crown of thorns (now held in Notre Dame Cathedral). They are currently renovating the rose window but you can still enjoy the other panels of glass. The short, subtitled video and the free multi-lingual cards all help to explain the different panels, tell you how best to read the stories and point out the highlights. Definitely one of the best things I've done in Paris and the perfect accompaniment to a visit to Notre Dame."

It was built to house relics of Christ brought here by King Louis IX. The first level is quite lovely and has a little souvenir shop but it is nothing compared to the sight on the second floor. The chapel is under reconstruction so you can't see the rose window but don't let this stop you. The remaining windows are awe inspiring and are all tales from the Bible. The way the light bathes the interior is lovely. On either side of the chapel there are monitors. One is a video and one is a touchscreen that allows you to navigate around the site where Sainte Chappelle sits. It is close to Notre Dame and also the Conciergerie.

The stained glass is amazing and one of the claims to fame of this church (chapel) is that there is so much glass in comparison with stone to support the glass, so it was a challenge to build it Although I like audioguides, I felt that the commentary was often too long and it is hard to find the exact pane they are talking about in the elaborate windows, so give yourself permission to skip some of the commentary. Recommendation: Buy your ticket on Internet ahead of time (you can print it out) to avoid the line which can be fairly long. You can buy a double ticket to also include the Conciergerie which is on the same street (there is not usually a line for that, but your double ticket is cheaper than buying the tickets separately.)The other recommendation; Read a bit about the history of the Crown of Thorns before you go. They claim that the French king St Louis bought Jesus' crown of thorns and built this chapel to house it. I am a Christian but don't know what I think about \"relics\" in existence hundreds of years after the fact. Anyway, very interesting. So read about it beforehand and make your own decision. Thanks, St Louis, for building this amazing chapel."

Some areas are overcrowded due to its popularity, especially the climb up/down the spiral staircase and on the upper floor. Choose a quiet time of day to visit. The chapel needs some restoration work, as funds are available i guess. Interesting souvenirs in the gift shop. You'll need 30 minutes to see it all."

We went quite early in the morning (approx 9:30am) to avoid the super long queues that we'd seen the day before and only had to wait around 20-30 minutes before we got in. The stained glass windows are breathtaking - it's like being in a kaleidoscope. Highly recommend visiting Sainte Chapelle :)"

Go before 4:30, they say they close at 5:00 but really they close at 4:20, security let me through at ~4:15, but the chapel folks told us they are closed and refused us entry.Avoid going during lunch, their lunch is 1.5 hrs long. not wheelchair accessible, museum pass covers it. don't miss the wall clock on the outside of the palace of justice next to it."

What a wonderful suggestion as it was magnificent. Even with the restoration work there is a lot of the stained glass showing. It is just gorgeous. I also enjoyed the evening concert so much I went back a second time. The acoustics are amazing. As the violinist danced his way down the aisle and ducked behind the renovation scaffold it still sounded like he was up front. Really wonderful!Do be aware that the security line is for the law courts and other offices in the Justice building as well as for Sainte-Chapelle which is located inside the area. And yes, you have to go thru security for the concert as well.The bathrooms that open onto the courtyard where Sainte-Chapelle is located as well as the next courtyard are yucky. Go to the 2nd courtyard and up the grand steps to the government building and find the bathrooms in there."

Built between 1239 and 1248 by King Louis IX, it housed holy relics acquired and brought from Jerusalem. King Louis IX was later recognized as a saint by the Catholic Church: Saint Louis, King of France. Amazing legends of a magical and enchanted chapel, home of one of the most extensive and beautiful in-situ collections of 13th century stained glass windows of the whole world. In its interior, the contrast of colors and light will bring you moments of inner peace and self-communion. Organize yourself, check schedules and visit one of the most impressive monuments of Paris. Enjoy!"

The history of the church is also quite impressive, but this attraction is one where you don't need to do any homework. Just walk in and be overwhelmed by the windows!"

You have to take the entrance of the Palais de la Justice, but there is an extra entrance for the visitors of the chapel. Remember to leave your metal objects at home, as you have to pass a security control before entering. Either you only go for the Sainte Chapelle (8,50\u20ac) or you buy a combined ticket for the old chateau of La Conci\u00e8rgerie (12,50\u20ac). If you want to do both, I strongly advise to buy the ticket at the second place to avoid the queue at Sainte Chapelle.... The chapel itself is a beautiful gothic style, 2 story building: At the bottom you have the ground walls, the souvenir shop and a possibility to rent an audio guide (4,50\u20ac). This will give you heaps more information than the free big boards you can take from a box upstairs, when visiting the second level. This level contains the famous coloured windows, which are stunning and a sight you should not miss when in Paris. Every window tells its own story and you can look at them for hours. I enjoy going whenever in Paris, but I always go early to avoid crowds. Really worth going and I also find it a fair value for your money. please note that there is still renovations ongoing. They were supposed to be finalized by the end of 2014, but there is noise, dust and scaffolding, and the first 2 windows are covered up. The signs do not tell you how long this will continue."

It is way more intimate, yet its granduer and exquisite architecture are way more impressive than Notre Dame itself.Efforts being made to conserve and restore this ancient gem in the heart of Paris, are also extensive, impressive and can be witnessed first hand during your visit. With so much going on to preserve the upstairs interior as well as all the incredible stained glass windows, the work was not intrusive, but highly informative in relation to dilemmas conservationists face to preserve the original integrity of the building and its contents.Highly recommended!"

The stained windows are upstairs, and they have information about the history on both floors. (I think there were English pamphlets on the first floor, but only TV's with subtitles on the second). Sainte-Chapelle is quite small, but you can easily spend an hour admiring the restored glass windows. Even though it was overcast, the windows were still very pretty, and I can only imagine how beautiful it would be on a sunny day. It can get pretty crowded, but people come and go pretty quickly.

The entrance is through the lower chapel which was originally used by the palace servants. The king and his entourage used the upper chapel.

Then, up winding and narrow stairs to the top floor - for royalty - with the Flamboyant Gothic stained glass windows. Magical! Do go \u2026The Paris Museum Pass is useful if there's a line. Nice to travel in December when there are fewer tourists!"

My son and I decided to snatch a glance at Ste.-Chappelle on our way to the Louvre one Sunday morning - and what good fortune that we did so. I was enchanted by the lower level, particularly for its architecture, its proportions, its intricate carvings, its arched ceiling,and was satisfied (though mystified because the windows weren't that impressive). Only then I learned that we hadn't even started! - the Chappelle itself was a floor above, 32 (actually 38) dark, narrow, winding steps to climb to - a thrilling sight. Tall, glorious windows stretching up from the small floor space into infinity almost: the light pouring in just taking our breath away. On a Sunday morning, when entrance is free, there were too many people crowding in to enable any one of us to make the most of the experience, but it is forged beauty if I have ever seen any. We both felt thrilled like we had not felt in the dark, sombre Notre Dame a couple of blocks away."

Throughout its long history, it is best associated with religious (primarily Christian) art and was ideally suited for the windows of churches. The 13th-century Sainte-Chapelle dates back to a golden age of gothic architecture but also takes the art and craft of using stained glass for fill its many windows to an unprecedented level. Built by King Louis IX, primarily as a private chapel to house the relics associated with Jesus's passion, it has a jewel box-like quality with the most impressive treasures meant to be found on the inside. It's easy to use superlatives like stunning and breathtaking to describe the experience of seeing the stained glass windows but even these terms seem to be woefully inadequate. I can only describe the feeling of seeing the light show on entering the upper chapel (via the narrow winding stone staircase) as being similar to being smacked in the face and punched in the gut at the same time - morbid, I know but you'll understand it when you see it. There are a total of fifteen enormous windows that occupy the nave and apse but it's likely that not all will be totally visible due to restoration efforts. Each window contains almost seventy circular scenes on a background of coloured patterns. Look out also for a 15th-century rose window that dominates the western wall.Tickets are required for admission but it's possible to visit free of charge (at certain times of the year) or at a discount - look for the information on the ParisInfo website."

This is virtually a secret place, so often overlooked by visitors to Paris, simply because it's tucked away behind the grand Cathedral of Notre Dame.Being both European and a Catholic, I have seen literally dozens of historic places of worship in many countries. The stained glass windows here top the lot. They tell the story of the Bible, from Genesis onwards. Whether or not anyone chooses to believe that the true Crown of Thorns or part of the centurian's lance were ever found, kept and brought to France is entirely their own business, but that's why this church compound was built; to house the holy relics. It was commissioned and consecrated in the middle of the 13th century by King Louis IX, who was eventually recognised by the Catholic Church as Saint Louis - the only French king so honoured.There's so much more to tell than I can do here, so put it on your list of things to do, whether you are a practising Catholic or simply a lover of beauty and tradition. It's currently undergoing renovation, but it should be complete late in 2015, after several years of skilled work, but the consequent difficulties of access did not detract from our appreciation and enjoyment."

First of all, understand that I am totally non-religious. The idea of splendid architecture \"lifting my soul into heaven\" is a non-starter! On the other hand, splendid architecture of any sort does, indeed, lift my spirits when I consider what man can conceive and achieve. Best I tell you of a visit we made to Sainte-Chapelle with my mother (who was very religious!),..The entry is into the lower part of the building, a small medieval Gothic chapel which served as parish church for all the inhabitants of the palace, This lower chapel is dark with low vaulted ceilings and does not appear to offer much to the visitor, except for it's well preserved state (the whole building is 750 years old). However, upon ascending the short, spiral staircase, one arrives into the absolute breath-taking splendour of the royal Sainte-Chapelle. Had there not been a seat readily available, I suspect my mother would have simply collapsed because the experience quite literally took her breath away. In fact, she sat there, unmoving, for over 30 minutes without saying a word - just absorbing the surroundings.The upper royal chapel is a beautiful example of the 'rayonnant' phase of Gothic architecture... giving a strong vertical feel and yet achieving a sense of delicacy and weightlessness. The chapel is dominated by unbelievably tall stained glass windows with only minimal stonework between each, and every inch of that is, like the vault below, richly coloured and decorated. You wonder how it can stand up on its own!If you can catch it in late morning or early afternoon, you will get the best effect of the sunlight through these amazing windows. Well worth a visit and easily achieving five stars,"

You enter on the ground floor and cant help but be impressed by the fleur de lys painting but its when you go up the winding staircase to the upper level that the splendour hits you. TYhe Stained glass windows whcih are massive and are all round the building are amazing. They end up with a large rose window inthe middle. At the time of my visit there were a lot of renovations taking place but it didnt detract from the wow factor. The kids were also really impressed. Definately worth a visit and if you buy a combined ticket with the concierge and see where Marie Anotoinette spent her last days then the queues arent so long."

The entire place was disassembled, the alter, pews, etc., were replaced with flood lights, ladders, and saw horses. It was a construction site with only the lovely stained glass windows to see.I am glad it is getting a face-lift BUT it is terrible to pay full-price to see nothing!That was a waste of my time and Euros. There should be advanced warnings AND a reduced admission during construction.In addition, it is a very small space. Ground floor has a few exhibits, all of which can be seen in 10 minutes. The narrow spiral staircase to the actual chapel has very steep steps. 2 people in our group of 4 were unable to climb them. The chapel is also very small.Even after restoration, I doubt that this place merits a visit. The most unusual feature is the architecture of the ground floor ceilings and it's bright colors."

Today, the Conciergerie and Saint-Chapelle on Ile-de-la-Cit\u00e9 are the only visible remains of the oldest palace of the kings of France.When you enter, it will be through the lower chapel, which was where the palace staff worshipped while the king and his friends and family worshipped in the spectacular upper chapel directly above. The lower chapel itself is lovely and intimate but it is a pity that there is a small souvenir stand inside which somewhat ruins the atmosphere. They could have found someplace else to put this. The centerpiece here is a statue of Saint Louis. He was born in 1214 and was King of France as Louis IX from 1226 until his death in 1270. He was canonized in 1297.You\u2019ll then take the spiral staircase to the upper chapel of Sainte-Chapelle, which is 33m long and 10.5m wide and normally has 15 huge stained glass windows and a large rose window from the 13th century that contain 1,113 scenes. Supposedly 70% of the stained glass windows in Sainte-Chapelle are original, which is amazing considering they were made between 1242-1248.I can only give \"three star\" rating right now because many of the stained glass windows in the upper chapel are covered, including the rose window, due to restorations and so you don\u2019t get the full effects. I was quite disappointed but at least I live in Paris and can easily go again. If you are able, wait until restorations are completed to visit. Once it is complete it will certainly become a \"five star\" attraction again. They\u2019ve been working on restorations since 2008 (on a staggering 10 million Euro budget) and it is supposed to be done in 2014 but here we are mid November already. I don\u2019t know if they really will be finished by the end of the year. It would be worth it to try and check before visiting. Definitely try and go on a sunny day, you\u2019ll see the stained glass so much clearer and it will be better for photographs. Please note that there are no toilet facilities! I went early on a weekday (French holiday, 11 November) and there were no lines and I walked right in, but I hear the wait is long during high season so take this into account.A good tip - buy a combined ticket with the Conciergerie right next door to save some money if you want to visit both."

The exterior is rather dominated by the law courts and administrative buildings."

We booked reservations a few weeks out, caught an early dinner and made the nice stroll to Ile de la Cite for the show. The space, which is potentially gorgeous at night, was heavily scaffolded for restoration while we were there. I imagine the effect, and enjoyment of the convert, will be even greater when this work is completed.We caught a Vivaldi performance - The Four Seasons. And while the setting and material may sound like the recipe for a very sedate and staid evening, the show was anything but. The personalities of the six violinists were all on display, and the energy and back-and-forth interaction the performers displayed made the concert extremely enjoyable. They clearly enjoyed playing so much you couldn't help but enjoy watching them.The Sunday night concert at Sainte-Chapelle ended up being one of the highlights of our trip. We highly recommend."

There was a lot of construction going on (restoration of the inside and outside of the building), so we didn't get a lot of great photos, but we were able to see the windows and read about the history of this church. There was a fairly long line to get inside when we got there, so we waited for about 20 minutes before going through security. We first saw the lower chapel and then the upper. The whole visit was only about 30 minutes long, but it was a nice stop during our trip.If you're going there, watch for signs indicating where the entrance is. That was a little confusing when we first got there."

A second staircase leads down so there is no traffic jam in the narrow staircase. The windows on the left side were under restoration at present but there were more than enough on display to enjoy. Well worth the bus trip and the bus stop is almost directly in front of the entrance. If you can, visit during a sunny day for the best viewing."

Back in Paris this weekend, I booked another concert and was really looking forward to it. How disappointing it was! The back of the interior is currently covered in scaffolding, and the great rose window and much of the other stained glass is invisible. The remaining walls seem to be covered in temporary wall hangings and the window sills are covered in a thick layer of grey dust, presumably from the building work. The biggest disappointment though was that the visible stained glass isn't lit from outside at night, so you get no sense at all of how spectacular it is in daylight. (Naively, I had assumed that the windows would have been floodlit at night when the chapel is in use.) In short, if you're thinking of visiting, check whether the renovation is still underway and go somewhere else if it is. If you MUST go to Sainte Chapelle at the moment, go in daylight unless you like sitting in dark building sites."

The upper floor is wall to wall, floor to ceiling stained glass windows and on a sunny day, it's glorious. The narrow staircase is fun for kids and the history of the place is fascinating. It doesn't take long to see the whole place, but is totally worth doing. The small gift shop has many treasures, including great tapestry pillow covers. It's close to Notre Dame. A little further down the street at the bird/vegetable market, there's a wonderful shop for Provence tablecloths, and another shop has a huge variety of Christmas ornaments along with wonderfully scented soaps."

The stained glass windows are indeed breath-taking and absolute works of intricate art. They are perhaps seen to best advantage on bright sunny days in order to maximise the visual impact. The windows have been undergoing painful restorative work over the past few years and this should be totally completed by next year. The work of the master craftsman who constructed these windows really glorifies God and clearly depicts biblical scriptures in a wonderful pictorial form at a time when much of the population would have been illiterate to the written word."

It's hard to get past how sad it is to see a decommissioned church (which is what this is) but the glorious stained glass made it possible to enjoy this as a secular visit back in the 80s - when I last came. Nowadays, half the windows couldn't even be seen because they are under restoration making the interior dingy. The admission charge remains just as high as if they could all be viewed. Shouldn't this be reduced by proportion.Queuing time for this attraction is horrendous. This isn't due to the high volume of visitors, as much as security arrangements that were completely inadequate for the (quite predictable) numbers. Converting the lower chapel into a shop is insensitive beyond belief. They might as well put a burger stand there while they are about it."

The windows here are larger and more extensive than in any other church or museum I've ever been to, creating unparalleled luminosity. It is just a single chapel, but the walls are almost all glass - more impressive than the Notre Dame's windows, which are high up and separated by large sections of Gothic stonework (leaving it rather dark inside).Queue management is poor, signage downright bad (no notice that it was closed between noon and 2). If you get a Paris Pass, you'll jump ahead of the regular queue, but annoy a lot of people in the process, since the signage is unclear.There is not much else.

When you first go in, it is rather touristy with all the crowds and limited viewing of the incredible stained glass. Then we climbed the tiny staircase in a corner to the main chapel and were overwhelmed. The light shining through the almost total coverage of stained glass was beyond inspirational. Now, I know what heaven must look like. You were totally mesmerized by the panes of glass and it almost brought me to tears. This is an absolute must see, but get a Museum Pass, good for multiple museums and attractions or you will be disappointed in the long wait to get in.

The stained glass windows are truly works of art. They depict scenes from the bible. King Louis, who ordered the chapel built, had bought the Crown of Thorns of Christ. The relics of the Passion of Christ were kept in a structure within the chapel. The structure looks like a little chapel within the chapel.It is still undergoing restoration. Part of one wall was covered. Nevertheless, climbing the dark stairwell and then seeing the stained glass windows with sunlight streaming through them is a special sight."

The line to get through security was very long but it moved quickly. The church is very small so you only need to set aside about 30 minutes for the visit (that includes waiting in the security line). We went during the last week of September it might be busier in the summer. Entry is included in the Paris Museum pass. No restrooms inside the church but there are some located just outside (within the judicial compound \u2013 Palais de Justice).

An utter disappointment is how I can best describe this evenng's performance at the beautiful La Sainte Chapelle in the grounds of the Palace of Justice. We had previously attended a similar recital two years ago when the musicianship was of a high quality, the commitment to performance clearly outweighed any tendency to showmanship, and the players demonstrated an appreciation for the audience. Tonight (30 September) we had a first violin/concert master who belonged in a gypsy band or a Irish pub outfit; he bowed as if only ever second or third note really mattered, raced at breathtaking speed to get through the program (coffee going cold?), and played as if to a largely uneducated audience (Vivaldi after all is not the most complex classical composer is he). Fortunately the venue is superb and a joy to behold, again and again. Organisers be warned: if you put on a program of Vivaldi (The Four Seasons); Albinoni (Adagio) and Pachelbel (Canon), please ensure you have players who are committed to fijne musicianship, and not to playing up to the crowd. It was like a monkey leading the pack tonight, and they all sadly fell into his line. If the organisers ignore their audience, it will quickly dry up and go elsewhere."

We paid for the best seats 40E each, but they have no ushers so we ended up back in the middle of the crowd. We were at least 4 rows into the mid price tickets.

You will have to go though security as it is located in the same complex as the central courts. It is very small but with more Stained glass than you see in any other cathedral , church or chapel. As a stand alone visit I'm not sure if it justifies the effort to visit , however based on the fact that you can also visit Notre Dame and lle Saint-Louis while your here I would say it is worthwhile.The chapel is under restoration as much of the Stained glass is very old.

The windows tell many stories of the Bible and a little advance planning will enable you to look for familiar stories as the panels are designed to do so. You have to go up and down a narrow circular staircase to see the famous windows. This would not be a good place for someone with mobility issues as the stairs are the only way up and down."

The stairs up to the stained glass masterpiece windows are tight and there is often a wait. That said, I still recommend visiting this lovely, relatively small cathedral. Its history is fascinating and if you're lucky enough to attend a concert here, I've heard it's the best way to enjoy the beauty of the structure, although I would make sure to see the windows with light coming through them. I'm not sure how this works, schedule-wise, because I did purchase tickets to see a concert here, then they were stolen when I picked up my friend from the airport. I only looked away from my bag for a second to fix my shoe/nylons (I had gotten all dressed up to look pretty for my visitor) but when I looked into my bag, my important items were gone including my passport. I know this is a sidetrack, but please learn from my mistake and don't let your guard down. I was living in France at the time and allowed for myself to get distracted, so it was my fault, but still, i was very disappointed. Nonetheless, I did visit Sainte-Chapelle a few times, and enjoyed it for different reasons each time. Do check to be sure there isn't a major renovation going on because it does affect how much you may enjoy your visit. Also, try to go when it's not too crowded. Listen to locals when they share tips of when to visit."

If it wasn't such a pain to get into this chapel (hint: it's a chapel not a church so it's probably a lot smaller than you expect), I might have given it a higher rating. The circus tent ceiling and fatal overdose of stained glass are certainly impressive, but truthfully, only for those who really love those things. I think they're nice, but overall I thought this was a waste of my time. Here's why: Sainte-Chapelle is located within the gates of the Palace of Justice. Therefore, the line outside is for security, not admission, so yes, even if you have a Museum Pass you must wait in line. Once past security, there is another line for tickets -- this second line you can skip with a Museum Pass. Also, the chapel is often closed 1-2:15 pm daily. So, if you arrive mid-day, or if you're looking for the ticket line, or if you're looking for the Museum Pass entrance, or if you're trying to figure out which line is which (one is for the chapel, one for the Palace of Justice, another for tours and handicap accessibility), you're out of luck because none of this is straightforward on the outside.There is restoration work going on (much needed on some of the woodwork), and so some of the windows are covered, but again, if stained glass is your thing, this is still worth your while."

This is the oldest church in Paris and is being lovingly restored. The stained glass windows are a work of art to be enjoyed and a sight to behold. We learned how to read the stories in these windows which opened up a whole new meaning to them. A very humbling reminder to how things were revered in days gone by. Do not miss this hidden treasure."

Having so enjoyed the chapel on a previous trip (it's on the museum pass!), this year we decided to splurge (our last night in Paris) and purchase tickets to a Vivaldi concert - it was worth every euro. This was no staid classical concert- the talented musicians filled the space with amazing sound and energy to a standing ovation at the end. For us this was a spur of the moment treat- walking by the chapel we noticed a sign for a concert that evening- the friendly staff told us tickets had to be purchased (cash only) in one of the listed shops or cafes across the street and luckily there were seats available (but I know friends who had purchased tickets in advance) Note* the chappelle was under construction but didn't detract from the concert- this is a delightful way to view the windows as during a \"normal \"visit it can get quite crowded."

You are in a 13th century church that was built to house relics of Christ listening to classical music played by a virtuoso on a violin that was made in 1749. What could be better?This concert was a string quartet (Les Violons de France) led by Frederick Moreau. They started with Mozarts \"Eine Keline NachtmusikBazzinis \"Dance of the Goblins\" which showed of his expertise on the instrument. The chapel seats about 200 people so be sure to get tickets early (I used Classictic). The acoustics in the chapel are very good and I think you can hear as well in front as in back.

It is not in this road. The entrance is around the corner on Bd du Palais. Maybe this is only due to the renovations. And what makes it more difficult is that you expect to be able to see a church or chapel. We saw nothing until we spotted a very small sign by a very long que, so we asked and yes, we needed to wait for what felt a very long time in the mist rain, at least 40 minutes. It is not very full but obviously the numbers are limited and rightly so. A very high security check point was followed by a dark interior of what appeared to be a very low key church in comparison to everything else we had seen in Paris. One can easily miss the tiny staircase near the entrance which leads to an explosion of diffused light. What a beautiful sight awaits you. Unfortunately, renovations are in progress, but don't miss this attraction for that reason. It is definitely worth every effort to find this little chapel. The detail depicted in these windows is unbelievable and the impression of height that cannot be caught in any photo is amazing to experience."

I had downloaded Rick Steves audio guide on Paris for my iPhone, and just looked through the list of places he had listed. I'd never heard of Sainte-Chapelle and had no idea what it was. Now that I've seen it, I won't forget it.The lower floor (entry) is decorated ornately and one might think this was it, but when you step upstairs try to keep your jaw from hitting the floor. The best word I can make up to describe this is stained-glass-topia. The entire story of the bible told in stained glass from left to right, top to bottom is laid out above you in vibrant blue, red, green, orange and gold colors. I don't remember how many tiles the audio guide told me there were, but it must be hundreds. The ceiling is cavernous and cathedral style. The tile on the floor is ornate and it's worth kneeling down and looking up at the ceiling to be truly inspired. I'm not a man of any faith so I speak objectively when I say I think people of any faith or none at all can probably find this place impressive and moving either from a historical perspective or a spiritual perspective depending on how you look at it.In short, Sainte-Chapelle is definitely worth a stop if you've got free time in Paris."

Visitors to Europe will no doubt comment after a few days' that they are heartily sick of the amount of cathedrals and chapels they have to visit, and that they all look the same after a while! Well Sainte-Chapelle, I can assure you, will be very different from the rest. Visitors will be dazzled by the sunlit giant panels of wall-to-wall stained glass windows that give the chapel its fame. Those (such as I) without any religious affiliation and who may not realise the significance of the stories of Christianity depicted in those windows, can appreciate them from a simply aesthetic point of view. The other architectural aspect of St Chapelle that fascinates me is the gold-fleurs-de-lis-on-blue-sky ceiling in the basement. I make it a point to visit this site with each trip to Paris, so I've probably been there at least 5 times, and I won't be stopping at this number. Unfortunately, I found during my visit in 2013 that renovation works ere underway, and a quick visit to their website shows that renovation will only be completed in Dec 2014. Nevertheless, for those who will not be visiting Paris again, it might still be worth the 8.50eur entrance fee. There is also a combo ticket with the Conciergerie (in the same Palais de Justice complex as St Chapelle, but separate entrances), definitely not as beautiful as St Chapelle, much more gloomy in fact, but may be worth a visit for Marie Antoinette fans (this is where she spent her last days before losing her head). The nearby Cite Metro stop may be worth a peek too, as it is one of the few surviving original metro entrances from the early 20th century. There is also a cheery bird/ flower market on nearby Place Louis L\u00e9pine on sundays.P.S: To enter St-Chapelle, you first have to go through a strict airport-style security line +/- xray machine check. Sharp objects (and obviously anything deemed dangerous) will be confiscated."

The visit would hardly take an hour if there is no queue. You could also visit the Palais de Justice next to it. Just go for the sake of the Vitraux - fine stained glass. Each pane has a story. Though not much explanation offered, it was beautiful to see. There is an entrance fee.Free for the handicapped and the accompanying person. They don't even make you stand in the queue to get in. The French are truly considerate and un grand merci."

One of the recommended sights of Paris, this is a small chapel tucked away next to the Palais de Justice; the Conciergerie is the large building with the turrets facing onto the Seine. (To avoid the queues, buy your combined ticket at the Conciergerie ticket office - a little more expensive but worth it)The lower chapel is your first taste of the decoration of the interior of the building although there are some incongruous souvenir stalls cluttering up this room.Go up the small spiral staircase in the corner of the room to get to the upper chapel and prepare to be amazed! The chapel is a very tall and narrow room with gorgeous decoration of the lower walls below the tall Gothic windows and with statues and the painted decoration running up between the windows to the superb ceiling of gold stars on an azure background. But this is only part of the decoration as the amazing Medieval stained glass will take your breathe away; the rich colours and design are quite wonderful. (There are free information sheets in various languages to explain the stories portrayed in the windows). Some of the windows are being restored (August 2014) but this should not detract from the overall effect. The only problem is the crowds and the noise; guides talking loudly to their parties, individuals reading from the guidebooks/info sheets and talking to each other and the ever present attendants making more noise by \"shushing\" people every few minutes!Nevertheless, this is an absolute jewel of a building and should not be missed!"

I am going to preface this with the following; This is one of the Top 5 places in Paris I have wanted to see, and one of the bucket list must items I can cross off. For me as an artist, this once private chapel lived up to its expectations and even more. If you are an artist, have an affinity towards the arts of the period, or just like beautiful things, in particular stained glass, this chapel will astound you. I am both glad and sad that restoration was still taking place, so we were unable to see the Rose window and a few panels, but it makes little difference once you are upstairs in the \"chapelle\" bathed in glorious transcending stained glass light. For me an experience beyond words. The chapel itself is in among the Conciergerie area and dates roughly to the same period as Louis' chateau. It has weathered the ages fairly, but does need care, restoration, and maintenance. So for that fact your entry admission goes to a worthy cause. On access: Fair warning for bad knees or walking issues it's a steep narrow staircase about 40 steps, has a handrail and is do-able slowly: just no elevators.A magnificent example of gothic art and glassworks, this pearl should not be missed. I can give you a quick mini art history lesson here about it: it is worth understanding that the glassworks in here rival any larger and more popular church/s even The great lady- Notre Dame, that existed during that period and even into today. The chapel itself resonates with light, color, beauty and reverence. And I think would touch anyone.Lastly, I am going to make a point the local Parisians might encore, please respect the fact that a lot of these churches and chapels are still religious spaces or hold religious value, and should be treated as such. It's only respectful to the country you are visiting to be aware that flip flops, cut offs, shorts, and tees ARE NOT appropriate wear to visit these kind places. And, it can totally mar another visitor's experience. I'd go on to add in about taking \"selfies\" too at the right and place time, but hopefully the majority get it; just Respect the Art and History.You may find this place quite special."

The Lower Chapel is like many of the older European churches, simply done. This was the Chapel for the commoners. But the Royal Chapel is actually upstairs, and will take your breath away. With more stained glass \"walls\" than actual walls, each panel is a chapter in the story of the Bible, from the earth's formation until the end of the world. They are constantly renovating in an effort to preserve this world treasure which dates back to Medieval times, so if you expect a little dust and perhaps some portions to be blocked off, you will be less frustrated by this necessity. Indeed, what a tragedy if they were not so diligent about giving this beautiful old building the best of care!

They also had a great video of the method they use fir cleaning and fixing the glass which was really interesting. We waited an hour at go thru security at ten am."

Also, the bible stories portrayed in the stained glass are not easy to see since they are small and very high up. Perhaps bring binoculars.

There are about a dozen panes. You read the panes from left to right, and each pane from bottom to top. There are no words, just artwork. If you know the stories of the Bible (starting from Genesis), you will be able to \"read\" the panes and understand which stories they are trying to depict.

Well thats not entirely true. You still have to wait in the long security line for sainte chapelle, but you do get to skip the ticket line at sainte chapelle. We were surprised by this, since we were told we'd get to skip both lines. But everyone has to wait in the same long security line, even people with museum passes. By the time we were done touring the conciergerie it was pretty late around 4:30pm. Sainte chapelle closed at 6pm that day for a concert. By the time we waited in the SHORT security line and entered the church it was 5pm - it took us 30 minutes to get through a short line, so plan your time accordingly. We took some pictures on the 1st floor and then we went up the spiral stairs (which are not stroller or wheelchair friendly) to the chapel. The chapel was amazing (it was a sunny day and that really brought out the colors in the windows). Even my kids really liked it. When we got there around 5:20 there were still lots of people everywhere. But by 5:40pm the place had cleared out. I'm not sure if the tours left or people just left to get ready for dinner, but the place was empty. Our kids quickly pretended to be ballerinas and dance around the empty chapel. Its almost magical when you are completely alone in this wonderful space. I highly suggest going late and staying until closing time. In the summer the sun is still shining through the windows at that time and you can truly appreciate the beauty without a thousand people making noise and crowding you."

Alighting at Pont Neuf station and crossing the Seine along the bridge which gave the metro station its name took us to one of the two islands in the middle of the famous river, the Ile de la Cite, and the Quai de L'Horloge along which we walked to the Palais de Justice. Here we queued in light rain, puzzled by the total lack of wet weather facilities for tourists, so we could buy tickets (\u20ac12.50 each) to visit Sainte Chapelle (\"Holy Chapel\") and La Conciergerie.The former is located in the courtyard of what used to be the royal palace but is now part of an administrative complex known as La Conciergerie. These are part of an even larger complex known as the Palais de Justice. A medieval gothic building commenced in 1246, it was built to house Louis IX's collection of relics of Christ which included the Crown of Thorns, the Image of Edessa (an image of Christ similar to the Shroud of Turin) and some thirty other items. After passing through an extremely slack security check in the form of a brief glance into my backpack, we stepped into a small, crowded room that was lined with very old looking, painted timber panels and nothing else of much significance apart from a statue. Wondering about the significance of this place, we noticed people ascending some very narrow, winding steps from a corner of the room and followed them upstairs to what was a much larger room with a very high vaulted ceiling and it's highlight: fifteen tall, quite spectacular stained glass windows containing more than 1,100 Biblical scenes as well as a massive, circular 'rose' window. While there's not much more to do than look and take in the craftsmanshipof amazing artisans, I thought the visit worthwhile just from the perspective of connecting with it's history - as you do with most ancient or very old buildings."

It is best to see it when the light is coming through the glass. It is not handicap accessible as there is a narrow staircase up to the window area. We stood in the middle and just gazed at each panel. Highly recommend it!"

            "review": "The Stained Glass tells a Story. Cost: 8:50 Euro for Sainte-Chapelle alone or !2:50 Euro for combo ticket with the Conciergerie. Free under age 18. Covered by the Museum Pass. Hours: March-Oct 9:30 - 18:00, Wed until 21:30 mid-May-Mid-Sept, Nov-Feb 9:00-17:00. We bought a combo ticket here for Sainte-Chapelle and the Conciergerie. There was a long line. I suggest you buy the combo ticket at Conciergerie since there was no line there. This 13th century Gothic chapel was built to house Jesus' Crown of Thorns (now kept at Notre Dame and shown only on Good Friday and on the first Friday of the month at 15:00). It was built between 1242 and 1248 for King Louis IX. The stained glass windows are spectacular. Climb the spiral stairs in the corner of the first level to reach the sanctuary where more than 1,100 Bible scenes are illustrated. These cover the entire Christian history of the world. The spire is Neo-Gothic and was added in the 19th century.There are 15 separate panels of stained glass, two thirds of it 13th century original. Each panel tells a story. You really need a travel book to follow the story in each stained glass panel.It was crowded, but it was worth it. Check-out the outside balcony on the 2nd level. Nice carvings not to be missed. A book with color photos is on sale downstairs with the postcards."

Sainte-Chapelle was the highlight of my trip to Paris, and one of the most beautiful things I have ever seen (I seldom give 5-star ratings). I am not a religious person, but I am an artist, and when I entered the chapel I was moved to tears (not normal for me, I assure you). Never have I had beauty strike me like that. The beauty in and of itself was spectacular, but more inspiring was that such a work of art and engineering could have been done so many hundreds of years ago, and that it has stayed largely intact through two world wars. Some people might see it as just glass and be in and out in 10 minutes, but if art and beauty have the power to change you, this is a must-see."

I recommend buying the combined tickets for the Chapel and Conciergerie for 12.50 Euro each adult and kids free. You enter the chapel at the ground floor, walking past some nice carvings and statues at the door frame and side walls. Inside is a brilliant arched dome ceiling with pillars all painted in bright contrasting colors. A view alone which looks enough of a show stopper; but wait there's more -And if you climb the circular stairwell right now you also get an amazing view of cathedral arched ceilings equally painted in vibrant brilliance and surrounding walls of an elaborate kaleidoscope of stained glass windows. It's truly an amazing place. I would have enjoyed it more if it was not so crowded. Getting decent photos was very difficult. I patiently waited long periods for people to move out of the frame. Out the exit and to the left you should immediately see the line for the Conciegerie."

I thought a second revolution might start at any minute and none of the staff seemed to care.The church is under quite a bit of renovation. You enter the lower level filled with souvenir counters and ascend via a very narrow staircase to the upper chapel where the view is breathtaking. It houses some of the oldest stain glass in Paris depicting scenes from Genesis to the crucifixion. The Rose window is stunning.Purchasing the audio guide was a waste of money. Producing a good audio guide is quite the science and art form, in itself. This one was bad - information overload and boring in its presentation. The sound quality wasn't great either. I would recommend doing your own research before you go, maybe make a few notes or highlight your guide book. Like some other churches in Paris, this one hosts evening concerts because of the acoustics but given the limited space, we couldn't imagine where they would take place."

If this incident had occurred in the USA, or anywhere else, it would be an immense shame upon the site and could never be accepted. I am appalled that The Centre des Monuments Nationaux could tolerate such disgusting behavior toward visitors.On the afternoon of Thursday, 24 July 2014, my family and I paid a visit to Sainte Chapelle. We had received high recommendations from friends who have visited in the past, and were eager to see the beautiful 13th century gothic architecture and stained glass. We were a group of six American adults and waited in the general line with everyone else for over 30 minutes in the scorching afternoon sun to enter. As we approached security check, a second line began to form. There was a sign reading something to the effect of \"Museum pass holders this line\" with an arrow pointing to the second line, and at least 30 other people left the general line, thinking that the gate keepers decided to expedite the process to relieve the congestion. If this sign had been so clear, why did so many people make this \"mistake\"? We were less than 3 meters from the checkpoint and in this chaotic moment, we too left our post to join the other pass holders. As we approached, the security guards began yelling at us that our passes did not grant us special privileges, and that we need to go back to the end of the line. Although both were rude, the taller one (about 180 cm) was extremely belligerent, and began screaming wildly at me, no farther than 30cm from my face. As a 157cm tall 51kg small Asian girl, I felt it incredibly intimidating, disrespectful, vulgar, and insulting to have a 180cm tall man screaming in my face -- not just in English or French, but a third language that I did not know. Since the man had a middle-eastern complexion, I can only assume it might be Persian or Arabic. He was not using reason to explain. He was using size, volume, and station to bully and terrorize us.Since English was our primary language, he stopped speaking English to us -- telling us in English that he did not speak it. We tried to get back into the general line where we were, but all three guards refused to let us pass through the metal detectors without going through the entirety of the line again. We asked to speak with the supervisor, and one of them rudely told us that he was the supervisor (he was clearly not) and continued to insult us. When we asked to speak with the police, the gendarme who came was also extremely rude and would not listen to reason. Other people who got back in line were not turned away. Perhaps it was because we were from the USA and spoke English, or perhaps three of the six members of our group were East Asian (Chinese). Whatever the reason, we were the ONLY group that were denied entry at that point, and I am convinced their racial discrimination played no small part. As a first-time visitor to France, this experience gave me the most unsavory sentiment that the French --especially the gendarme -- have the least amount of class and respect out of all of the countries I have visited. If this is not true, Parisians should be more than ashamed to have men like these in their midst."

Summer in Paris is characterised by many wonderful concerts in a variety of churches. The concert we went to at La Sainte Chapelle was Vitali's \"Chaconne pour violin\"; Pachelbel's \"Canon\" and Antonio Vivaldi's \"the Four Seasons\". It was performed by Classik Ensemble who are world class performers. They played beautifully, engaged with the audience and appeared to be thoroughly enjoying their work, which in turn rubbed off on the audience. We found about about the concert on Sunday morning, bought our tickets on Sunday afternoon and attended the concert on Sunday evening. The next day we found out about a piano recital that was to be held in Eglise Saint-Julian-le-Pauvre, which is one of the oldest if not the oldest Church in Paris, on the following evening. The programme by Jean-Christophe Millot included works by Beethoven and Chopin. We bought our tickets at the Church a half hour before the performance and had another wonderful evening of superb music. Any visitor to Paris during the Summer season who is at all interested in going to wonderful concerts in astonishing venues should look for them in advance to take advantage of them. We paid 25 and 23 Euros respectively for our tickets which we considered to be wonderful value for what was presented. At both venues were were within 3 to 5 metres of the performers. Web sites that have information about concerts are www.euromusicproductions.fr for concerts at La Sainte Chapelle and www.concertinparis.com for concerts at St Julian Le Pauvre. Classical music concerts in Churches in Paris are also being held this Summer at Eglise Saint Ephrem in Rue des Carmes, Eglise de La Madeleine in Place de La Madeleine, Eglise St Germain des Pres off the Boulevarde St Germain and in Notre Dame Cathedral on the Isle de Cite."

If you are a serious lover of classical music and have a discerning ear, don't go to these concerts - it felt like the group just got together for specific purpose to make you suffer.

We had walked around it a few times, and it turns out that the reason that it had not made much impression initially was that a lot of it was covered in scaffolding and drapery as it's undergoing a major renovation. Because of this, be prepared that you will get to see the Lower Chapel, and you'll be able to see a very small portion of the Upper Chapel, but most of it is closed to the public. On the plus side, there is a nice video of how they go about painstakingly preserving and refurbishing the stained glass windows, which are spectacular, even in the limited view of the chapel.

Apart from Chartres (south of Paris), Ste Chapelle has the most stunning stained glass in all of Europe. The scale is awesome, and the colors are magnificent. The chapel architecture itself is lovely, but for me, this is all about the fantastic glass. Ste Chapelle also hosts numerous classical music concerts. If you have time and inclination, I recommend seeing a concert in this unique and beautiful venue."

It was fantastic to look at the beautiful stained glass windows while enjoying a concert. Unfortunately about a quarter of Sainte Chapelle is covered by scaffolding etc and cannot be viewed at all. I was just as glad we hadn't paid full admission price to just look at the Chapel."

It was a bright sunny day outside so the glass being hit by the sunshine simply sparkled. The only down side is the ongoing renovation to the glass meant that not all the windows were visible. Definitely worth seeing and not a place where you have to wander and wander. No getting lost here. Just grab a seat (if you can) and sit and marvel."

The narrow stained glass panels and the Moorish-influenced brightly painted columns on two floors, set it apart from any other church in the city or in Europe. It is unfortunate that those responsible for Sainte-Chapelle have allowed more commercial enterprise within the church. It takes away from the sanctity of the space. the construction underway in the spring of 2014 means part of the chapel is unavailable to visitors but it is still well worth a visit. If you plan to attend any church concerts in Paris, this is a wonderful space in which to do that."

Once inside the upstairs chapel, one is surrounded by fifteen or so gorgeous stained glass windows, each focused on a different section of scripture. The effect of the late morning light streaming through those incredibly colorful relics of 800 years or so was absolutely incredible. Unfortunately, the rose window was undergoing restoration and we were unable to view it, but I can't imagine it being any more breathtaking than it was when we experienced it. In addition to the stained glass, try to get a good look at some of the other ornamentation on the walls - there are small paintings, carvings and enamel or porcelain work throughout the room that really need to be looked at. It is remarkable to me that this structure has survived the years in such good condition. Don't miss this."

We paid our 8.5 Euros apiece and entered a small dark church with really nice stain glass windows and a gift shop. Okay... is that all there is? I knew that something was amiss when my sweetie volunteers to climb a spiral staircase to something called the \"upper chapel\". She hates spiral staircases. At the top was an unbelievable church with absolutely fabulous stained glass surrounding it's entire perimeter. Very little space was wasted with stone buttresses and mullions. I was transfixed by it's beauty only to learn that the piece de resistance, the rose window, was blocked from view as part of a restoration. Guess we'll have to go back next year after they celebrate the 800th anniversary of this wonderful church."

The stained glass is simply marvelous. One word of caution though. The chapel is undergoing restoration so expect scaffolding both inside and out. Not all the glass panels are obscured, just be aware that this exists.

Was not very crowded either! If you are looking for an attraction in Paris that isn't packed with tourists I would visit here. You may still have to wait in line to enter and run into tour groups but it will not be as crowded as Notre Dame. During my visit in April the building was under construction which is why it may have appeared to be so small, but you may need to ask for an elevator if you are arriving with a wheel chair. Worth the trip, and was so nice to see a \"small\" church in a big city!"

No trip to Paris is complete without a visit or two to Sainte Chapelle, the small church sharing the Ile de la Cit\u00e9 with the better-know Notre Dame Cathedral. But Sinte Chapelle is a masterwork of its own with extraordinary, building length stained glass that bathes the entire inside in a multi-colored glow. Try visiting either in the early morning or later in the day when the intensity of the sun isn a little weaker and the colors of the windows even richer. And if possible, attend one of the frequent chamber recitals or other musical presentations offered in the evening (tickets required) which are a magical event in this jewel of a church. As always with stained glass, bring binoculars to see details in the higher reaches of the windows."

We walked by at about 9A on the way to Notre Dame and the line was about the same length, so I don't think getting there first thing in the morning is very advantageous. I don't usually wait in line, but it was moving quickly. We waited about 15 minutes. There system to get in was a little irritating. There was more security to get in than into Notre Dame. There was a slow moving metal detector line that everyone has to wait in....including those with a museum pass (no cuts on this attraction). Once pass security you go inside the church...where they are selling stuff and there is some stained glass. You go up the stairs....and I was expecting some neat stained glass windows, but I was surprised HOW cool the glass was. It was better than I thought it was going to be and worth the 15 minute wait. They were making some repairs on some of the glass, but it was still really neat.If you have the museum pass and the line is pretty short, pop in. It's neat."

After waiting in a lengthy line, a museum worker put out a sign saying that the chapel would be closed from 12:30 - 2:00 for lunch (not sure of exact times posted, but the sign was put out after we had been waiting about 20-30 minute). The line seemed to be moving along, so we decided to chance it and continued to wait. We got in before 12:00 and entered the lower level of the chapel, which was interesting, small and very pretty, but you needed to go upstairs to see the amazing stained glass. We saw others heading for a staircase and followed along. The second floor was incredible!! I love to see beautiful stained glass and this was just amazing!

The small chapel enhances the slender windows as they ascend in graceful arches, flooding the grey stone in rich, translucent color! I make a point of going there whenever I am lucky enough to be in Paris. Last April, we were very lucky. As my sister and I walked toward the chapel, I saw a poster announcing concerts being held at Sainte Chapelle in the evenings. Reading closer, I realized Vivaldi's \"Four Seasons\" Concertos were being performed that evening. We decided to attend, and after having yet another wonderful dinner in this great city, we bought our tickets for about 15 Euros each and took our seats in the small pews of this exquisite example of Gothic architecture. Imagine light filtering in through stained glass windows as the first notes of Pachelbel's \"Canon in D,\" which opened the concert, engulfed the room. It was so beautiful, beyond words. There were only 5 musicians, all playing stringed instruments, and I couldn't believe how much music came from 5 instruments, they played the entire \"Four Seasons,\" and with the amazing acoustics, filled the church with delightful music! At one point, the lead violinist strolled up the aisle as he played, smiling pleasantly! Truly, this was a once-in-a-lifetime experience, combining beautiful visuals with rich sounds. I highly recommend an evening of wonderful music at La Sainte Chapelle! You will find info online, for 2014, I found events through the end of the year. This is a memory I will cherish forever, and hope you are able to have a similar experience at one of the upcoming concerts."

You can either buy tickets online or across the street from the entrance to the Ste Chapelle at the small tourist shop. You can usually also buy tickets at the door but not always. You should get there about an hour before the concert starting time since seating is first come first serve in three sections, depending on how much you have spent for your tickets. Remember that you have to go through security before you are allowed in. For concert schedules, Pick up a copy of Pariscop at the newsstand on Wednesday to find on what is happening that week.

The Sainte-Chapelle is located in the courtyard of the Palais de Justice - Paris Law Courts, on the Ile de la Cit\u00e9.It was built in the 13th century for King Louis IX (St-Louis).There are two chapels, the lower chapel used by the king\u2019s staff members, and the upper chapel, St-Louis\u2019 private chapel that contains the True Crown of Thorns.Both chapels are simply stunning!You\u2019ll find a wealth of carved, painted and gilded walls, ceilings and columns and an astonishing set of stained glass windows that seem to be suspended in the air.A true feat of architecture, and beauty at its best!You access the Sainte-Chapelle on Boulevard du Palais.Queues can be very long during peak season as the Sainte-Chapelle is one of the most visited sites in Paris.I suggest you buy your ticket online before hand, that will allow you to use the prepaid channel.However, even this channel can be a bit slow during peak season as more and more visitors tend to buy their tickets online.Most people visiting the Sainte-Chapelle want to visit the Conciergerie which is also located in the Palais de Justice, but has a completely different entrance.If you do so, I suggest you buy a dual ticket Sainte-Chapelle-Conciergerie, as you\u2019ll get a discount and won\u2019t need to queue for the second site.As the Sainte-Chapelle is located inside the Law Courts, there are very strict security checks at the entrance. You have to open your bags and have to walk under a portal, so don\u2019t carry any metal objects (scissors, pocket knife etc\u2026) as they will be taken away. You\u2019ll be able though to recover them after the visit but it would be a bit of a hassle!Be aware that you will not be able to take full picture of the stained glass windows of the upper chapel as it is under restoration until the end of 2014.Be also aware that they are narrow staircases involved to go up to the upper chapel.This might prove a challenge for people with physical mobility issues.You get there by Metro, get off at the station \u2018Cit\u00e9\u2019 on Line 4, it\u2019s just opposite the law courts."

We had plenty of time to see the Chapel without feeling that we were rushed. The famous Rose Window is under renovation; hence boarded up - you won't see it. The Gothic interior and other stained glass windows are stunning; particularly in the late afternoon sun. Sainte-Chapelle can be accessed \"free\" with a combo-ticket purchased at Le Conciergerie or the Paris Museum Pass. There are two evening concerts of classical music, held at 7:00 and 8:30. Advance tickets are available on-line, but honestly with the on-going renovation and the chance of getting a \"gloomy\" night, I don't know that the expense is worth it. Many reviewers have raved about the experience; I'm just not as sure right now with all the plywood! We went on an impromptu basis; the light was perfect and the people were few!

Go early before the lines get long but, regardless of the wait time, it is well worth the visit. Built during the reign of King Louis IX (also known as Saint Louis) in the mid-13th century, it was located in what was then a royal residence and complex. It is now part of the complex that houses the Palace of Justice. The King returned from the Crusades with religious relics (a piece of the Cross, the crown of thorns, the blood of Christ etc.) he wished to house in this royal chapel. Once you get through security, you enter a courtyard housing the Sainte-Chapelle and legal courts (another reason for higher security). You enter through the lower chapel (for those who served the King) with columns and beautifully painted walls before going up a narrow, medieval stone staircase to the upper royal chapel with its famous tall stained-glass windows and columns, each bearing at its base a statue of one of the 12 apostles. Take advantage of the seating along the perimeter and the explanation cards in several languages to read the explanations for each of the windows. On a sunny day, and if there is no scaffolding due to restoration work obscuring them, they are breathtaking and speak to you across the centuries! Please note there is a small staircase to get to the upper chapel one floor above but no elevator."

What a beautiful sight with the sun pouring through the glass. A must see in Paris. We also went to a concert in the evening on the 2nd floor which was great. My opinion is, if you go to a concert, is don't waste your money on the expensive tickets up front. The venue is small and you can hear the music just as well from the back."

Crammed in the heart of Paisian government buildings and with no edifice visible from the street , Saint Chapelle does not proclaim its importance or incredible status. A truly unique building and World Heritage site , you enter and discover the spiritual heart of the great French Medieval kings. The private chapel of French royalty its interior is full of the powerful and unfaded richness of Medival colour and pigments that were afforded by kings.With colours we have forgotten how to make let alone name , the Chapel ground floor is like stepping into a Knights Treasure chest  But all this is dimmed by your next encounter with the astonishing Medieval glass windows of St Chapell on the buildings first floor. Entering up a tiny stairwell your head emerges at floorboard height and your neck cranes to see the hurling reaches of the incredible and truly beautiful stained glass windows made by artistsans that time has forgotten . As window jewellers to the French kings these people were clearly the best craftworkers in Europe and understood the religios importance of their work.I know visiting churches can seem boring but this is an extraordinary exception and gives the viewer a direct insight into the spiritual life of the most powerful people in Europe- don't read the historical tracts on the walls just step up and experience the light..It's emotional ...!"

We used the Paris Museum Pass and were able to walk right in with no line. It is small but the windows are impressive and very different from other churches like Notre Dame.

We then, almost by chance, noticed some very tight winding steps near the enterance to the building and decided to go up and see where it leads. Exiting the steps at the top leads you into a large cathedral style room that takes your breathe away with the intracecy and immensity of the staned glass windows. It is overwhelming!.

We ran across the street to a caf\u00e9 where the waiter took 1 euro to hold the knife for us. At 5:15 we ran back but were told we could not get in as they closed at 6 and stopped letting people in at 5:30, which was not in any of the guidebooks. We returned another day and it is lovely; however, it us under renovation so the famous rose window is covered up and several of the other windows as well. Some people did not realize that the main windows are upstairs...the main floor is nice but just a taste of the best. It was cloudy and rainy the day we went...try for a sunny day to see the light coming in the windows. It must be spectacular. It's a gorgeous space, gothic arches etc."

The painted walls are of particular interest, definitely worth the queue and the wait. Suggest however to come early even though the best light is at noon, but then thats when the line snakes right outside and along the street!"

Also, there was a great deal of renovation going on and a lot of artifacts were covered, not their fault. You may never see so much intricate stained glass in your life time with such historical content. The location of the Chapelle is located in a very historic location with lots to see including The Notre Dame Cathedral.

The Sainte-Chapelle was originally the royal chapel and has 15 three story stained glass windows (some are being repaired) that are remarkable. With any natural light Sainte-Chapelle glows. We have not seen an equivalent to it. There is a lower chapel which is very attractive and then you must climb a narrow staircase to the upper chapel where the stained glass is located. The Sainte-Chapelle also hosts chamber orchestra concerts. The orchestra played Vivaldi in the chapel for over an hour and it was an inspired evening for us. Tickets for the concerts can be bought for cash at the main entrance or the nearby Deux Palaise caf\u00e9. They sell out quickly. A ticket at the back of the chapel (still a great view) costs about $25. We cannot recommend the Sainte-Chapelle enough."

Upstairs the chapel was for royalty and the court ,and is all coloured light, it is more glass than wall and I can only describe it as like being inside a kaleidoscope or an exquisite jewelled lantern. Not only is the glass impressive but also the painting on the walls. Currently the chapel is coming to the end of an extensive restoration and the rose window and some of the tall 50 feet windows remain covered but there is still more than enough to make the visit worthwhile and the restored and cleaned windows absolutely sing and probably look as good as they did 800 years ago. I can only hope that the authorities include restoration of some of the beautiful painting that is being very badly damaged on the narrow staircases."

I suggest you leave backpacks, large bags and so forth at home, as you will go through an airport like security station including xray.It is just a little way down from Notre Dame, on the Ile de la cite (the island in the Seine where Notre Dame is located). There is only one small sign, that I've seen, pointing to the entrance.A nearby Metro station is St. Michel. This is perhaps a five minute walk to the entrance.I highly recommend you attend a concert if you can. They are about E 25 to E75 depending onthe seating. Personally I think the cheap seats are just fine.When last I saw St. Chapelle, in early May, there were over 100 people in line to see it."

Most churches depress me: they are built to make the human feel small and insignificant and that is not my idea of us. This one, Medieval Gothic, elegant, graceful, endlessly pleasing to the eye, even though it\u2019s going through a renovation of the huge rosette window, is like a ferry-tale.  Staunchly devote King Louis IX built it in 1929 to host Christ\u2019s Crown of Thorns, which he had managed to buy from the impoverished Latin Emperor in Constantinople. The purchase price of the holly relic was about three times what the building of the church cost to His Majesty. It was built next to the King\u2019s Palace so he can step directly from His Kingdom into the antechamber of the Divine One. Ironically, the Palace was destroyed but the Church stayed. The irony is that the Crown is not even there anymore, it\u2019s in Notre Dame\u2026So much for historical preservation. Converted into administrative offices during the revolutions (Barbarians in all places and times are quite alike), it is now back for us to see and enjoy immensely.  Two lines to get in La Sainte Chapelle, one through security (it\u2019s adjacent to the Ministry of Justice) and one for tickets. The first one moves fast, the security gate is not working, but they don\u2019t care. The guard wants to know what\u2019s the red air duster in my photo bag, I tell him \u201ca hand grenade\u201d. Guard does not like that and pumps the duster, then lets us go trough."

At the entry level there is a small chapel with a statue and interesting wooden gilded ceiling. At the second level the beautiful stained glass with vaulted ceiling leave the visitor in awe. It will require some time to appreciate the details of the different glass panels. Also, there are medieval religious paintings on the walls and some doorways. There are also some wooden carved images around the room. Can also appreciate the intricate wood carved frames on doorways, windows, walls and arches.To get to the second level, needs to go up through a spiral narrow stairway. Take care when coming down.

I think the price is a bit steep for the shortness of the view (you have two levels) although I used my Paris Passport.

When I travelled in 2012, it was with my \"kid family\" and easy movement by foot is no issue. This time I travelled with my \"parent family\" and I suddenly realized how hard it is to get into Sainte-Chappelle. You see, in 2012 I had been so awed by the beauty of the stained glass that I carried away no recollection of the tight spiral staircase that leads from thenentry floor to the upper level. Honestly, I don't know what I was thinking! How else was one going to get from level to level in a 14th-century church? But sure enough here I was encouraging my mom and sister up the 30 or so steps to the upper chapel ... and then we had to come down again. It was not a good thing! What should have been an awe inspiring moment at the top of the stairs, was simply a moment of relief that the ordeal was temporarily over. Her comment? \"Is this all there is to see?\" I was so sad! It should have been an experience of awe and wonder, but instead it was disappointment. I had genuinely wanted to share with her what had been a transcendent experience for me two years ago, but crucially, I neglected to calculate the stairs.So this is my warning: do not take someone to Sainte-Chappelle if they cannot easily handle 30+ tight circular stone steps!Other than that, how was it, you ask? Beautiful, but not quite as radiant at 2012. The restoration now has the rose window covered and this really disrupts the light. On the other hand we were amongst the first to be allowed in after lunch, and we virtually had the place to ourselves, and I have to say it felt oddly intimate.If you can tough out the line and manage the stairs, then do not pass up Sainte-Chappelle ... and then schedule yourself for a return trip when you know the restoration is over."

The stained glass was breathtaking. As we were leaving I noticed a tiny sign about concerts in the chapel. WOW!!!!We bought VIP seats to an evening performance of Vivaldi's Four Seasons \u20ac40 (I think it was \u20ac30 for mid-seats and \u20ac20 for the back of the room). What an experience! While it wasn't the best performance I have heard (some may disagree) it was absolutely well worth the price and a truly wonderful experience to hear and see such a performance in a room like that (one that had already been around for some 475 years before Vivaldi wrote Four Seasons). I could imagine kings and other dignitaries hearing similar performances hundreds of years ago in the very same spot). I highly recommend attending a concert here. Even with VIP tickets go early to secure the seat you want."

A queue, of course, to get in - and note that pre-booking a ticket makes little difference, as the wait to get through security seems to affect everyone alike. The glass is indeed stunning, but the rose window and three others are currently being restored, the space covered in scaffolding. The guidebook gives lots of general information, but is a bit short on specifics in the reading of each window, so unless your Biblical knowledge is extensive you may have difficulty in making much detailed sense of the narrative of each window.Binoculars (or a good zoom lens on a camera with view-finder) make it more possible to see the higher windows.But an unmissable attraction."

But within a ten minute walk is the jewel of Sainte-Chapelle with its beautiful stained glass windows. The church is rather pedestrian on the outside because it lacks the ornate sculpture and architectural beauty of Notre Dame Cathedral. But step inside and you can't help but be overwhelmed by the ornate and elaborate stained-glass windows that are even more beautiful with the late afternoon sun streaming in. Although the church is in the midst of a multi year restoration effort that limits the view of some of the windows, don't let that dissuade you from this visit. The Paris museum pass covers the admission charge."

I'd advise going when there's plenty of sunshine outside, it really makes it all the more striking (although I only went the one time so can't really compare to a time, say, if it was raining and cloudy outside). The renovation is a little distracting but not a big deal...when I was there it was maybe 1/8-1/10 of the room/the panels.

It is a little difficult to get into because of its location within a government facility. I would not pay the price to just see this. Since I had a Paris Museum Pass that got me into most of the Paris museums, this was a very easy one to visit after seeing Notre Dame. It is only a few blocks away and next door is the Conciergerie and the Crypte Archeologioue is also nearby. It is an easy day to see all in a short visit and stop by the open air flower and bird market as well. This will take in four of the sites included in the museum pass and only take 2-3 hours. So if you buy a museum pass, I would include the chapel. If you don't buy a museum pass, I would probably skip this one for better sites to visit. There are quite a few stairs to climb to get to the upper chapel. Lines to get in can get very long because of security."

Celebrating its 800th anniversary this year (2014), and the 40-year restoration of the glorious stained glass windows in the upper chapel will be completed in time for the festivities at the end of the year. In the meantime, even though the north side is boarded up for the final touches of its restoration, you absolutely MUST see this gem when in Paris. In fact, if you do only one thing, do this!The engineering and the artistry of this chapel cannot be overstated. The windows, impossibly tall, seem barely to be supported by the thin stone supports between them. In fact, you can almost imagine the entire chapel floating in air, as if it is a real-life slice of heaven. Get a copy of the materials explaining the meaning of each of the sixteen panels, and linger as you study each one. In fact, have a seat on the floor, gaze up, and in 15 minutes you'll be in a state of contemplative bliss. Truly the most awe-inspiring man-made structure I've ever been in, and also the most spiritual Warning: the lines to get in can take hours and hours, especially in summer. Three tips to avoid the lines: 1) see it off-season, e.g. in January. On a sunny day it's every bit as spectacular in winter as it is in spring and summer 2) go on a rainy day. Rain seems to keep the crowds down, though not completely away, of course 3) best bet: wake up early and queue up an hour ahead of opening (that would mean arriving at 8:00 November-February and at 8:30 March -October. Bring a croissant and a coffee, and enjoy the early morning vibe on Ile de la Cite!! It's worth the effort!!"

Then you enter into a glorious, amazing opening of stained glass walls. There are virtually no walls, only thin ribs holding up the glass that goes up several stories above you. The sheer fact that this place survived not just 1 but 2 World Wars is amazing and a testament to the French people who lovingly sandbagged the glass to protect it from the bombings. If you are fortunate, the sun will come shining through the glass - but it truly does not matter if it does not. The place is so awe inspiring even on a cloudy day! And do remember it is still a church. When people become too loud, they have people there to remind you of that fact and provide the proper \"shhhhhhhh\" to be quiet. Truly, do not miss this place.

It's small with a lot of people but you're still able to see its splendor. The lower portion with a low ceiling was for commoners to worship. Upstairs was for royalty. There are printed guides in various languages that tell you what the windows depict and you can make out a few figures but you really want to take in the overall view. There is construction and renovation inside and outside but it's still enjoyable. Don't miss it."

It was built by Louis Xlll to accommodate his Holy Relics, many of which are likely to prove valueless. More than 30 in number, including fragments of wood said to be parts of the True Cross and the Holy Lance, the most revered is the Crown of Thorns thought by some to have been worn by Jesus at his crucifixion. The Children of the Revolution didn\u2019t have much respect for the relics or the chapel. Parts of the latter were destroyed, and the former were dispersed, although, some have regained safe keeping in the nearby Cathedral of Notre Dame. It really comprises two Chapels: Upper and Lower. The latter is dedicated to the Virgin, of whom it contains a very attractive statue. Its low vaults are supported by 12 pillars each containing a medallion of one of the 12 apostles. The ceiling is star-spangled to represent Heaven, while the floor contains tombstones beneath which rest the remains of ecclesiastic personages associated with the Chapel. The Upper Chapel is a marvel of light sharply-pointed arches forming a dramatically inspiring tracery reminiscent of King\u2019s College Chapel, Cambridge, but these are complemented by some of the most superb stained glass windows of any church I have seen, and the wall-space filled by glass vastly surpasses that of wood or masonry, so that the entire interior is filled with a joyfully spiritual multi-coloured light that is nothing short of breathtaking. There is also a dramatic and contrasting Rose Window facing West. The 12 Apostles feature here, too, but in the form of beautifully carved statues. The whole gives the impression of an enormous jewel-box, fitting for the so-called religious treasures over which it stood guardian until their dispersal. "

La Sainte-Chapelle (The Holy Chapel) is a royal medieval Gothic chapel, located near the Palais de la Cit\u00e9, on the \u00cele de la Cit\u00e9 in the heart of Paris, France.Constructed around 1246 the Sainte-Chapelle is considered among the highest achievements of the Gothic architecture. Its erection was commissioned by King Louis IX of France to house his collection of Passion Relics, including Christ's Crown of Thorns - one of the most important relics in medieval Christendom. Although damaged during the French revolution, and restored in the 19th century, it retains one of the most extensive in-situ collections of 13th-century stained glass anywhere in the world. Sainte-Chapelle stands squarely upon a lower chapel which served as parish church for all the inhabitants of the palace. This chapel, which is rather plain, is dedicated to the Virgin Mary. The most visually beautiful aspects of the chapel, and considered the best of their type in the world, are stained glass windows of the upper chapel, surrounded by delicate painted stonework. Fifteen huge mid-13th-century windows are in deep reds and blues and illustrate 1,130 figures from the Bible. The large rose windows with Flamboyant tracery added to the upper chapel in 1490.We waited in long line to get inside and after were another line to buy tickets. But it was absolutely worth waiting.

Trying to navigate a new city and language can be difficult but become a bit more difficult with a child. We stopped here because it was free with the museum pass and we were not knowing what to expect. However, it quickly became one of my favorite sites in Paris.First, it was extremely easy to navigate where to go to skip the ticket queue and we got right into the lower level. Right away, a guide saw our stroller and directed us to the stroller storage area (roped in, secure and under supervision from theft) and had us put our stroller in.Second, when you exit the stairs into the upper level you will immediately be stunned by the quality of the stained glass. It is unlike anything I have ever seen. I am not an \"art\" fan and am rarely stunned by art but the amazing mix of art, architecture and engineering that went into the creation of this stained glass is simply stunning.You could stay for an hour or be in an out in fifteen minutes. Either way, Sainte-Chappelle is a must see in Paris and I will surely be stopping back in in the future."

My husband had a pocket knife and our friend had a sealed bottle of wine and a corkscrew. We were told that we could leave those items with the guards but would not be able to get them back. There was no mention of these restrictions in any of the materials we had read nor was there anything posted at the site.

Nestled among the buildings of the Palais de Justice, Sainte-Chapelle is worth searching out and in many ways holds its own against the larger cathedral on the island. Built between 1242 and 1248, the chapel was originally meant to house the relics of the Passion of Christ that Louis IX purchased in the years before its founding. Adding to the prestige of both France and Paris, the relics also obviously added to the significance of the structure that housed them; after two visits here in four days it is easy to see why. There are two parts to the visit: the lower chapel and an upper chapel. The former also functions essentially as the entrance with audio guides available for purchase and the usual assorted souvenirs. It is worth a few minutes to look around as a statue of the Virgin Mary greets visitors at the portal and the ceiling has impressive openwork struts linking the aisle columns to the lateral walls. A winding staircase on the left leads to the upper chapel which is \u201ca truly monumental and sumptuously decorated reliquary\u201d as the free printed guide says and for once I must say this isn\u2019t hyperbole. Fifteen stained glass windows up to 50 feet high depict no less than 1,113 scenes telling the story of mankind from Genesis through to the Resurrection. The great shrine at the apex of the chapel is the area where the relics used to be displayed and there are statues of the 12 apostles between the windows that add to the general atmosphere. An impressive western rose window rounds out the major highlights of the interior. A video in French describes the ongoing restoration work and plastic descriptive boards are available for free at the rear. Overall this was a worthwhile visit even with the restoration work, without which this easily would have been a 5/5 attraction. I was the first person through the door on my second visit and had about 30 seconds of precious solitude in the upper chapel\u2026. until the jack hammers started at the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd windows. An obvious necessity, the restoration work does detract a bit from the whole experience but you can also use that as a learning tool to study the techniques of period refurbishment, right? The audio guide wasn\u2019t really valuable as it often made reference to windows that were too high to see from a ground vantage point, and much of the information was found on the free material available at the entrance. By no means should any of these quibbles discourage a visit. The sheer beauty of the interior of the upper chapel make up for any (well, at least \u201cmost\u201d) drawbacks of the restoration. Anyone coming to see Notre Dame should stop here right afterwards. Thumbs up."

One entire wall and a half was covered for restoration. Also, the staff is extremely rude. We don't speak French (their English was just as bad), the instructions were not very clear and we were not treated nicely when we didn't know what to do. Don't get me wrong, the view of the stain glass of the chapel is amazing. Also on the plus side, no guide is needed to understand the works inside the chapel as there descriptions in all languages. My recommendation would be to read what we you are going to see beforehand so that you don't get this bitter feeling of \"I paid too much to see this\""

            "review": "Sainte Chapelle is an architectural masterpiece. Saint Chapelle is a 13th century building of gothic and medieval design that is an absolute masterpiece of its day and age. It is often referred to as one of the most beautiful standing buildings from this time period. Saint Chapelle is located on the Western side of Ile de la Cite, just a few minutes walk from Notre Dame Cathedral is very much worth visiting. Entrance is \u20ac4.5 per adult and the attraction is included as part of the Paris Museum Pass. Saint Chapelle is actually a small attraction with only two main chapel halls to visit. The downstairs chapel, known as the Lower Chapel, was created as a place for commoners and servants to worship. This room is well decorated with low vaulted ceilings and makes a nice place to look around before making your way to the celebrated Upper Chapel. The main reason for visiting Saint Chapelle is to see the Upper Chapel, which houses 15 large stained-glass windows, made up of over 1100 religious scenes, created on individual panes. When the sun pierces through, it creates a kaleidoscope of colour and spectacular sight bound to impress even those with the least interest in visiting historic churches. Overall, Saint Chapelle is a historically and architecturally important attraction and a remarkable place to visit in Paris. For first time visitors to the city, we would highly recommend adding this to your must-see list of places to visit. Hint: You can comfortably visit in 20-30 minutes but don't underestimate the time spent in queue to get inside, particularly during late morning to early afternoon when the sun is higher in the sky. Do consider obtaining a Paris Museum Pass, which includes entry into Saint Chapelle, in order to reduce the time you must queue to see this attraction. Hint: Make sure to bring the brochure, available in the Lower Chapel, which highlights the 15 different windows in the Upper Chapel. This will help you identify what you are looking at when upstairs. Hint: If you visit the Musee du Moyen Age, you can see some of the original panes from Saint Chapelle on display. This provides a great opportunity to view and inspect panes up close, something you can't do at the chapel itself."

The problem was that it was a blistery cold evening in April and the church has no heat. Everyone in the church was dressed head to toe in winter gear and still shivering. The atmosphere and music were truly exceptional but the cold made it difficult to sit and really enjoy it all. We know a lot of older buildings in Paris are without heat or air conditioning but you're usually moving about. Just sitting for an hour in the cold was tough. I would recommend that if you're going for a concert, go in late spring or early fall. Sainte-Chapelle is a must see either way."

The downstairs is dark with little to recommend unless you are in to architecture of religious buildings. But the upstairs is three quarters stained glass.

Moreover, our guide was excellent and has adequate knowledge about history, informative about all sorts of things, i.e, tips about to eat and more.

Read up on this fabulous gothic church so that when you visit, you can just soak in the beauty and the faint but imaginable medieval intentions and experiences lived by people in this place long ago that lie just beyond our grasp in the memories of time.

The Sainte-Chapelle or 'Holy Chapel', in the courtyard of the royal palace on the \u00cele de la Cit\u00e9 (now part of a later administrative complex known as La Conciergerie), was built to house Louis IX's collection of relics of Christ.With the Palais de la Cit\u00e9, today called La Conciergerie, the Sainte-Chapelle is one of the surviving buildings of the Capetian royal palace on the \u00cele de la Cit\u00e9. Although damaged during the French revolution, and restored in the 19th century, it retains one of the most extensive in-situ collections of 13th-century stained glass anywhere in the world.We attended a live concert intitled \"A Little Night Music\" on Sat November 16. Walked from our hotel in the cold and waited in line briefly. Then through a bag check and then walked across a small courtyard and then into the building where the Chapel is located. We took out seats and had time to absorb all the details that the chandeliers hanging over heard illuminated. It was very cold inside and poofs of white floated on the air as all of us breathed in and out \u2026.. At the Alter area were the chairs for the Musicians. Hearing Pachelbel's Canon played by 3 violins and 1 cello was the highlight for me but credit must be given to the Opera Singer as well.If you can, check the website for future concerts and Go!"

We've visited this magnificent church on three different trips to France, and without question, Sainte Chapelle is our favorite cultural attraction in Europe. We were fortunate to visit in 2008 before the scaffolding went up for the long term restoration project, but even with portions of it behind the canvas, this is the most spectacular stained-glass display you will ever see. Actually, work on the last section was just getting underway when we visited in October. If you're planning a visit for late summer in 2014, maybe you'll get lucky and you'll have 360 degrees of brilliant stained-glass artistry. Although nobody ever mentions it, the lower chapel is pretty impressive on its own. Spend some time here before you go up and you'll be especially impressed. Nothing else will impress you after you visit the main chapel. Here are some things to remember. Buy the Paris Museum pass, and you'll get to skip the ticket line. You WON'T get to skip the security screening line which can move slowly, but once you get through, you won't have to stand in another line to buy tickets on site. One way to avoid this (or at least minimize this) is to arrive early. Don't arrive late. If the sun goes down before you get inside, you'll miss out on a lot. If you're planning on shooting photos of this place (and you will) bring your widest angle lens. The inside is smaller than you think, and you'll be frustrated if all you have is the usual zoom lens that comes on most DSLRs these days. Most point and shoot cameras have a very wide angle setting that will work just fine. Camera phones, of course, have nothing but a very wide angle lens. Most people think you have to have a bright, sunny day to get the maximum effect, but in some ways, a cloudy-bright or overcast day works better. The lighting is more even. But don't pass it up just because it's a beautiful sunny day. In fact, get ready for an astonishing sight.Don't forget that Sainte Chapelle hosts a number of evening organ concerts. That's a good reason to come back for a second visit after dark."

The chapel is quite large by chapel standards, but obviously can't be compared to the grandeur of a cathedral. Once inside, the comparison becomes irrelevant. The stained-glass windows of Sainte-Chapelle form a wall of glass around visitors and bathe them in a sea of ros\u00e9 light.

Once we got to the church we waited maybe 5-10 minutes to buy tickets. Museum pass holders went right in without waiting. We had a cloudy day but the windows were still bright and beautiful. I was worried about this as I heard you needed to visit when it's sunny but that really wasn't the case. The upstairs chapel is beautiful even with the left side covered in scaffolding. It's neat to see the video of the painstaking effort taken to restore the glass. You can see the difference when you look at both sides of the room. The downstairs chapel is also very nice with the columns and decor. Overall it was less then an hour visit but well worth it. We also went back to Sainte Chapelle to hear a concert at 7:30pm. Honestly I wouldn't recommend it at this time of year. It was so brutally cold inside and with no light the windows look dull and the lighting was very low in the church. The music was beautiful but we could have been listening to it anywhere. We were very anxious for the hour to end so we could warm up. If you do decide to go make sure you have a hat, scarf, gloves, warm coat and maybe a small blanket to put over your legs. Also you can buy tickets while you are in line and if you buy online don't worry about what tickets you get because it's open seating anyway."

Then, you can climb the circular stone stair case to the upper level - the king's level. Glass, glass, glass - a chapel of natural light. Unfortunately, when we were there, a major restoration was in progress and one side of the chapel is nothing but scaffolding, tarps, and workmen.

I know that Vivaldi's Four Seasons is popular in Paris and one can find it being performed somewhere at almost any time, but the performance by Classik Ensemble with David Braccini was beyond great. His violin is so light and animated that he makes other performances seem boring by comparison. My biggest regret is that I did not buy a CD on my way out and if anyone knows where I can get a copy, please get word to me through this site. Aside from the concert, the chapel itself is a place of remarkable beauty and should be seen during daylight to appreciate the light through the stained glass."

I think that had I arrived on a day without that I would be more impressed. NOTE: After getting to the front of the line up you will see a 8.5 X 11 inch paper identifying objects which are not permitted within the chapel and which will be confiscated and discarded should they be found upon your person - this includes, among other things, cutlery. Since we nearly always carry our picnic pack, that notice facilitated a return trip the next day without any of the forbidden items."

While Sainte-Chapelle would appear to be overshadowed by Notre Dame, and everyone has to see Notre Dame, this chapel stands on its own as something that must be seen. The scale, it is a chapel, makes the incredibly beautiful windows all the more spectacular. Be sure to go with a guide. The information provided ties it all together beautifully, from the more simple chapel downstairs to the gorgeous one upstairs."

We took the metro to the St.Michel stop, crossed the bridge, and walked a block up to a very impressive building with huge stairs and definitely a police presence. I looked to the left to see a line of people walking into a small entrance and asked if this way the way to the concert. All smiles-it was one of the performers. Security is tight here. We followed the people and walked up a flight of stairs and walked into one of the most beautiful chapels I have ever seen. The sun was setting and we watched it wane over exquisite stained glass windows. These 13th century stained glass windows are the best and oldest examples in the world. The small chapel was commissioned by King Louis IX of France to house Christ's Crown of Thorns.Because it was built in less than twenty years, everything is very symetrical and coordinated. The chapel is under renovation so parts are a bit dusty and some covered, still the beauty shines through. Next we sat to ready for the concert. The lights dimmed and the performers came on stage and began. Absolutely fabulous. The lead violnist is superb. He walked up the aisle and my sweetheart who rarely is impressed clearly was. Vivaldi could not have been performed better. If the weather turns, bring a coat. Keep in mind that central heat was not available even to kings as far back as the 13th century. Look at YouTube to find clips of the performance."

Not to mention you come up a small, spiral staircase and are greeted to brilliant reds and blues. The Blue in the stained glass cannot be reproduced, though some have tried, and found no place else on earth. Especially a treat if they have a choir singing.

The stained glass is beautiful and it is massive. Each piece seems to tell a piece of a much larger story and the longer to stare at it the more details emerge. To be honest, we rounded through fairly quickly. We did go upstairs to the upper chapel and enjoyed the beauty and tranquility of the space.Since this was covered by the Museum Pass, I felt that it was worth the trip. However, if I had to pay separately for admission I might have reconsidered. It was easily visited before or after a trip to Notre Dame because of the close proximity."

I wanted to see the inside and thought going to a concert would be a good way to both listen to beautiful music and see the breathtaking stain glass. I mistakenly thought it would be more lighted inside the cathedral and it wasn't. There was a lot of construction material on the ground besides the chairs and you couldn't see the colors in the windows at all. The music of Bach was beautiful (solo violinist) but otherwise nothing to see. Go to an earlier concert booking where it seems you'll get the illumination of the last light of the day. Buy tickets at the trinket/souvenir shop across the street from the entrance."

            "review": "Breathtaking. Even if you're not into stained glass windows or Gothic architecture, Saint-Chapelle is an absolutely stunning place to visit. Saint-Chapelle was built as a private chapel for King Louis IX (who was later canonized as Saint Louis) to house various holy relics he brought back to France following the Crusades. Since the chapel was designed to be the personal royal chapel to the King and his family, the whole place itself is quite small, but the stained glass windows are truly a sight to behold. You can rent an audio-guide for 4,50 euro, although simply reading up on the church beforehand will probably be enough for most visitors.I have only rated this sight as a four out of five because there is a lengthy wait to pass through security before you access the ticket counter at the chapel. The chapel is situated on grounds shared with a major courthouse in Paris. All visitors, even those with the \"skip the line\" privileges of the city Museum Pass must wait in this security line. Thankfully, the line moved fairly smoothly when I visited (I waited approximately 15 minutes), but I would imagine that the wait-times would be much busier during the summer."

I agree with another reviewer who said the entrance was difficult to find, as the chapel is in the middle of a government complex and can't be seen from the street. You will have to go through security to get in, then there's another line to wait in to get into the chapel. (Although our museum pass allowed us to go right in. We got some nasty looks from people in the regular line.)This chapel is one of my \"must sees\" in Paris. The stained glass windows are breathtaking. When we were in the highly decorated downstairs, my mother didn't quite understand why I wanted to go there. But when we climbed the little spiral staircase and came out into the upstairs chapel, and I turned to her and said \"THIS is why,\" THEN she understood.I also agree with the reviewer who said the audio tour drones on and on and on about the windows. I don't need to know what each panel of the window describes. And with so many windows in the chapel, we would have been there for hours listening to the complete tour.Renovation work is being done on some of the windows. I found it to kind of spoil the effect of the upstairs chapel, but when restoration needs to be done, it needs to be done. (We found that in early/mid September, many places were starting restoration work.)"

But, I was not prepared for how overwhelming the chapel was. My husband and I were able to get tickets to attend a concert of Vivaldi performed in the chapel by a chamber group. When we walked through the door, the stained glass was catching the last of the day's sun. It was truly breathtaking and I think I held up the line as I tried to absorb the impact of the windows. The several hours we spent inside the chapel surrounded by the beauty of the glass and listening to Vivaldi was wonderful, certainly one of the highlights of our stay in Paris. Even with the renovations (and I ended up seated beside a big pile of construction equipment), the chapel is a not-to-be-missed stop in the city."

The great room is up the little staircase and is not the room you first enter, as interesting as that room may be. Also, the headsets can only be rented at the ticket booth (no signs that I recall), and not at the actual headset booth inside St. Chappelle. Also, as with most Paris museums, skip the long wait for tickets by purchasing a multi-day museum pass and skipping to the front of the line.

My husband and I climbed these narrow stairs and our mouths hung open as we indeed came upon the awe-inspiring second floor room of floor to ceiling stained glass.

Some structures overwhelm you with their size and power. Ste.-Chapelle is intimate but powerful due to the sophistication and lightest of the stone work that holds up so much glass. Definitely worth visting first then going to the larger and heavier Notre-Dame. I suggest you will get more out of your visit if you do take a little bit of time to study why the construction of this church was/is so remarkable and to compare it to Notre-Dame."

Its massive high cathedral like ceiling with big gothic spans have some weird acoustic value that is seen to be believed. Being Australian I cannot believe the sophistication of this place 500 years before Australia was even discovered.Tip is to go early before the tour buses get there which is around 10am to 2pm.

The chapel is under renovation and is a bit smaller than it appears in the photos, but it truly is beautiful. What a wonderful setting for an intimate concert. I thought the acustics were very good, though I've read reviews stating otherwise. Possibly my ears just aren't that trained. Additionally, we were sitting close enough to witness the wonderful back and forth action between the musicians. The first violinists performance took my breath away! We had no issues finding the entrance to Sainte Chapelle and the concert kicked off exactly on time. Sainte Chapelle is very close to Notre Dame and the entrance is accomodated through the Ministry Building, which is beautiful as well."

The chapel on the second floor was our main interest. There are fifteen panel windows of hugh stained glass from the 13th century. The story is told from left to right in the windows, however, they are so very tall, it is hard to see all the way to top. We just stood, enjoy the light coming through and absorbed the beauty.

I think it's in the Palais de Justice, which is closed at weekends and securely patrolled on a Monday morning. They were repairing the fabric of the building, when I went; that was December, 2012, so the work may be complete by now. The beauty of the Chapelle lies in two things: its seemingly impossible, soaring architecture and the astounding stained-glass windows. The architecture is easy: the architects, who hadn't a clue about scientific architecure, just happened to get the details right, but the glass is another matter. It is utterly glorious: similar to what one can see in Notre Dame, but the visitor to Sainte Chapelle can appreciate the colours, the message and the detail far better. British stained glass of this era perished, I think, in the English and Scottish Reformations (if not then, in the Civil Wars of the 1640s). If I go back to Sainte Chapelle, I'll take a small pair of binoculars, to view the higher panes. There are good guides available."

Unfortunately, I had to use my vivid imagination to recreate a considerable part of the cycle of biblical stories depicted on the astonishing stained glass windows of the Holy Chapel due to present restoration works. Apart from this inconvenience, the Holy Chapel is to be visited. It was located in the courtyard of the then medieval Royal Palace (today, an administrative area) and built to house some precious relics of Christ. Nowadays this building remains one of the most striking example of Gothic architecture. In the lower Chapel the statue of Louis IX, in addition to the immense rose window and the walls dominated by blue, red and gold colours, can be admired. The second floor is brighter and all architecturally projected towards the sky in a metaphorical attempt to reach God. The rooms are quite small and the presence of many people can make your visit less enjoyable."

I found the audiovisual display in one corner very distracting and could have done without it, but most of the other visitors made a bee-lilne directly to it so I am obviously in the minority. It is the glass most visitors come to see but the gilded statues are interesting and the carvings on the upper door are stunning and really well preserved. Tthere was restoration work ongoing which meant several of the windows were boarded up and there was constant background noise - the price for preserving such a beautiful place and ensuring we can still be visiting in twenty years!

I love this small, Gothic-style chapel located beside the Conciergerie, a short walk from Notre Dame Cathedral, for its beautiful stained glass windows, well-known for the fact that there is little space between the frames that hold the panes of stained glass, thus creating the effect that you are enclosed in stained-glass majesty. So, I was disappointed this visit to see that only half of the windows is visible because restoration and cleaning is currently underway on the left side as you face the altar. The side that is open to viewing appears to be clean and in good shape. I was just disappointed that I couldn't see the entire stained glass display, since the cleaning is enclosed in a wooden box-like structure that obstructs the view of those windows from the public. If this is your only chance to see Sainte-Chappelle, then consider your options. The bookstore inside Sainte-Chappelle does offer many materials that contain color photos of the complete interior, so this can amplify your actual visit during the cleaning process."

This should be available to check on security cameras too.After passing through the security check, due the negligence of the security stuff, the box containing my personal items fell on the floor resulting in serious damage to my DSLR camera \u2013 body and lenses.The security stuff advised me to send a letter as soon as possible in the attention of Monsieur le Secr\u00e9taire General de la Cour d'appel de Paris, having the equipment invoices attached, with the assurance that I will be compensated for the damages.The camera model is Nikon D7000 with the lenses Nikon 18-105mm f/3.5-5.6G AFs VR DX. After the incident I checked with the security stuff the equipments and concluded the damages.I asked if it was necessary to give them the equipments as a proof, but they advised me that sending the letter with the printed invoices would be enough.I attached to the letter my personal details, address and contact information.Nothing happened since then, not a single phone call.So, this is how the things are working in France, especially near the Cour d'appel de Paris - where Sainte-Chapelle is located (what an irony ...)"

They are located on the second floor and there are about 30 steps to trek up but it is not too hard of a climb. The stained glass depict the stories of the Bible and because it was done in glass it was a real accomplishment for that time period and a \"first\" for a church to have \"walls of glass\"... It was a modern wonder for that era."

Once inside the courtyard, signs will direct you to the chapel entrance where you can purchase tickets. Even with a long entrance line, there were few people inside the chapel making it an enjoyable experience. You will need to climb stairs to enter the main hall with the stained glass. Half of the window are currently undergoing renovation/preservation, but the remaining half are breathtaking. The first sight after entering the main hall is amazing! Be sure to pick up a placard near the opposite side of the room (near the exit) that explains what each window is about."

So this church was built by Louis the 14, just to house the crown of thorns \"relic\" he bought for more than the cost of the building. (the relic is still displayed periodically, but not at this church. you have to go to Notre Dame to see it...) The 1st story has a very ornate, low, vaulted ceiling, and it's got some things to see, and a gift shop. Once you go upstairs, though, you come out of a spiral staircase, and are struck with the huge stained glass walls, starting at about 8 feet up, and continuing to at least 30 feet from there. Most impressive. This space is worth the trip to Paris by itself!The entry is covered by the Paris Museum Pass (highly recommended)."

The interior of the church is undergoing renovations, but despite that, it's beautiful and contemplating the glorious windows while listening to Vivaldi, Handel and Albioni was a real treat!"

My wife and I have been to a number of concerts at the Sainte Chapelle over the years and all of them have been quite serviceable. In the past the advantages have been the opportunity to watch the sun set through the rose window and the joy of being able to walk straight in (after passing briefly through security) and look around without the need to queue. However, on our latest visit we turned up 40 minutes prior to commencement (as instructed) then waited half an hour in a stationery queue outside the venue for no discernible reason. On the plus side, I think the current renovations are being undertaken very sympathetically and didn't diminish my enjoyment of the experience. A spectacular venue, but the unnecessary wait was very annoying."

Walking up the spiral staircase and being hit with the spectacular view of stained glass windows totally surrounding me was an experience I'll never forget. The stone in both the upper and lower chapels is also painted with rich colors, so you get a feel for how the church looked originally. While the security check to get into the restricted government complex surrounding the chapel can be a bit long and annoying, it is more than worth the headache to view this gem!"

Come on a sunny day to fully appreciate the effect of natural light in the building. Its remarkable....almost enough to keep my tear ducts moist. at the Duck in through the Palais de Justice and be amazed by the soaring sight of flying buttresses,which does it for me,anytime. Yet, its the fleu-de-Lis ornamentation that takes your breath away. But wait....there is more.... For sheer poetry,climb the narrow spiral staircase and gaze at the most beautiful gothic Chapelle Haute. The 15 stained-glass windows seem to glow with red,wine and blue colors and its hard not to acknowledge spirituality seeping into your heart.. The walls are made of glass and make the anthology of scenes from 'Eden to the Apocalypse' outstanding,not withstanding the lovely rose window. Book yourself in for a concert,because the acoustics are remarkable and the pleasure immeasurable."

However, in saying that we noticed that those visiting the court entered via another adjacent security entrance without delay and came out into the same courtyard area.

Get there early - In the summer, it opens at 9:30a. If you get there and find the lines too long, go to the Conciergerie just a block away towards the north bank of the river and purchase a \"jumel\u00e9\" ticket for both sites. There's usually no line to get in, and the visit is worthwhile. You'll get to see the cell where Marie Antoinette was held and the private chapel they built for her while she was there. Then take your ticket for Sainte Chapelle and \"jump the line\" by going in on the left side of the entrance. You can also use this entrance if you have a museum pass, but I don't recommend getting the pass unless you're willing to do 3+ museums a day during your stay.When you enter on the ground floor, take a few moments to look at the small chapel and small stained glass windows on this level. Skip the gift shop - you can do that on the way out. Then trudge up the circular staircase into the main chapel and be prepared to be awed. Malcolm Miller who is the resident expert guide at Chartres (not to be missed if you have time to do a day trip out of Paris) told us that because most people were illiterate, the churches and cathedrals all told the story of the bible in their glass. Big places like Chartres Cathedral and even smaller ones like Sainte Chapelle have enough windows to be able to let you \"read\" the entire biblical story. They are the \"libraries\" of their time.Grab one of the explanatory placards on the way in and spend as much time as you like gazing at the art and the story in the glass. If you want to try to grab a photo or two of the glass, set your camera to *under* expose by one or two f-stops. Use a normal exposure to shoot the length of the chapel."

Compared to all the other famed cathedral and churches in Rome, Florence, Paris and Warsaw, the Sainte Chapelle's stained glass windows still strikes me as the most impressive and exquisite!However, when we visited on the 4th July 2013, almost half of the 15 panels of window were closed off for cleaning and restoration. (Still, the admission fee was full-priced, Euro 8.50)But even then, the light pouring through the remaining window was impressive. However, my fiancee was most dissappointed and annoyed because he felt deceived. Having been there some years back when all the windows were unobstructed and seen the stunning effects, he wanted to share with me the same wonderment of such light play. It was a shame I never got to experience the same. How is it that Sainte Chapelle do not post updates about restoration work so foreign visitors like us are informed beforehand so we can prioritize selection of sites to visit."

The windows are made up of so many panels it is confusing. Better to just go in, and soak up the beauty. We went around 2 or 3 PM, no line, no crowds."

Fascinating to watch people in front come out the police security check and the look on their faces is sometimes \"Huh? I'm in the middle of a courtyard, where is the chapel???\". There was soon I guess a couple of hundred people in there, but plenty of room for all.The ground level where the staff went to church is quite elegant in its own right, but the reason you re there is to climb the narrow winding staircase - me with my walking stick - to what I once saw described as \"like being inside a jewel\". I think thats going a bit far, but it certainly is spectacular. Some of the panes are a bit dark where the sun doesn't reach, and naturally some panes were screened off for cleaning. The bench seating along one side is a good idea, allowing you to rest your neck for a while looking up at the same time. All but the lowest are too high to actually see the story they tell.Don't miss the outside balcony - some really interesting statuary at eye level.Good value on the Museum pass, so much else to see within 100m (Conciergie next door, flower market around the corner, Notre Dame and Crypt just down the road, several nice picnic spos on the Isle)."

We waited around 15 minutes to buy a ticket. Upstairs one can find the amazing window each depicting a story out of the bible. One can also learn how the windows were originally made and how they do get preserved. The seem also to have concerts there which must be fantastic."

This is one of the most famous Gothic structures anywhere and is truly a high point of the art of stone and glass, allied in the most extraordinary way.As advised by others, a Museum Pass is the way to go for this and other sites in Paris. It enables one to avoid queues at most destinations and represents great value. One tip for first-time visitors: select what you want to see and aim for two sites a day. If you don't have time to see all the sites you want, save them up for the next time. Generally, although it has it's challenges, Paris will draw you back time and time again even if the tourism and site authorities need to get their collective acts together."

The price King Louis paid for the Crown of Thorns greatly exceeded the cost of the church itself. This relic is now in the Notre Dame museum and presented to believers for veneration on the first Friday of each month. As other reviewers have noted, a good part of the church is currently being renovated but it was still a worthwhile visit especially if you appreciate Gothic architecture and awesome stained glass windows. The gift shop was better than most; I bought several lovely medieval style tapestry pillow covers there."

It is a small building, originally built to hold religious artifacts owned by the king, and is sumptuously adorned with painted walls and ceilings that complement the beautiful stained glass windows. If you come into the main sanctuary from the undercroft you are visually transported into the holy. I enjoyed watching the faces of others as they came into the upper room - almost everyone said WOW! and all had smiles. It is that kind of place. Please note too that there is a series of concerts at Ste. Chapelle (ticket purchase required) that might be of interest."

The floor below is nice enough but the one you must go upstairs to see is incredible. To get upstairs you go up a narrow circular staircase and when you get to the top and see what's there, well, wow! We had been there a couple of times before so we knew what to expect. We started watching people when they got to the top of the stairs and how they reacted. Their mouths were often wide open and eyes wide open as well at all the colored stained glass. The glass extends all the way around the room. Not just stained glass here and there but all the way around a rather good sized room. The idea to build this special chapel was the idea of well known king Louis IX and it was all built in only three years in the 1200s. Amazing! However, right now part of it is under renovation so that about one third of it is blocked off to view. There often is wait to get inside. The Paris Museum pass gets you inside for free and you are often able to shorten your time in the line. It's also very close to Notre Dame with perhaps a five minute walk from the middle of the Ile de la Cite to the eastern end. The Conciergerie is also quite near. One bit of advice- go on a sunny day to really do justice to seeing the stained glass."

There was only one lady selling tickets and then a guy who took the tickets and 2 others just standing around, not very efficient. Yes the windows are beautiful and impreessive but the rest of the Church is in an appalling state. They really need to start restoring the columns, walls etc inside the Church. You can see just as beautiful if not more beautiful stained glass windows in other areas of France. I was very disappointed with this visit."

There's usually a 40 minute line to get in, but it's worth seeing. The lower part is extremely beautiful, but it's nothing compared to the top part of the chapel. Stained glass windows take up most of the walls - it's breathtaking. Unfortunately they are under renovation until around 2015 so some of the windows were covered. We spent about 30 minutes there, not including the line."

The large stained glass windows, of which one fifth is currently covered, are fabulous and depict books of the Bible. The info card near the entrance sheds a little more light on the windows, or this attraction risks becoming no more than another photo fest for tourists who like to have Paris bragging rights. For another 4 euro (purchase of a combined ticket), the conciergerie is also very interesting and kept my husband enthralled when I chose to continue gazing at the beauty of the large coloured glass panels in Sainte-Chapelle. Lined up for around 30 minutes, first past security check, then the ticket purchase queue. You first see a shop in a small chapel, so go up the spiral staircase directly to your left to experience the craftsmanship and beauty of the stained glass windows."

Despite having reserved tickets for any of the first nine rows of seats, a very officious young man would not allow us to sit forward of the eighth row...sorry those seats forward are reserved. Note that if you want to sit close to the performers, get to the site extra early. For my money, I would not do this concert (e.g., Four Seasons) again.

If you want to see the windows at their best and hear a cheesy classical concert, go to one of the early evening concerts they have there regularly. For the price, I expected a better performance. I don't want to sound like a musical snob (but maybe I am), but the classical music performed was done pretty badly. Technically, it was played well. Artistically, it was terrible. There is a difference. Regardless, seeing the church windows at sunset with the light shining through is worth putting up with bad music! This is a masterpiece."

You enter the small downstairs chapel first and while it feels like many you may have visited in the past, be sure to go upstairs to feast your eyes on some of the most magnificent stained glass you've every experienced. What is unbelievable is that it tells the entire story of the bible in 1113 scenes in 15 windows. The building was built in only 6 years. It's a quick stop with other worthwhile stops very nearby, like the prison where Marie Antoinette was held and a collection of awesome gardening shops."

This queue was in fact security screening. Once past this, we walked around to entrance to Sainte-Chapelle itself - no queue there - and bought tickets. Kids were free - always a good thing.Entered Lower Chapel first - thought this was beautiful, colourful decorated wood panelling etc, very ornate, and a number of stained glass windows, plenty to absorb.Then up a narrow circular staircase, to the Upper Chapel. Wow. You are immediately hit by the colour from almost continuous stained glass windows in this area. Very beautiful indeed. Again, lots of other decoration as well, so it is very sumptuous. At the moment there is an area covered up for renovations along part of one side only, the other side is unaffected, as is the front of the chapel. There is a small balcony area where you can retreat and view through the doors - also plenty of carving here.Not a huge area, but a lot to take in. Back down other circular staircase to exit to Lower Chapel again, with gift shop area along one side.Would certainly recommend as worth seeing, if you have the time."

We had to wait quite a while to get in, then lead through a maze of corridors before arriving at the chapel. There was renovation work being done on one wall.

Huge stain glass windows - these the best I have seen anywhere! Note: There is a major renovation going on (2008 to 2014) and about 20% is covered up at the moment. It looks like 60% has been completed, and these windows look great, and 20% remains, and these look very 'dirty'.This attraction is a great experience and I recommend to all.Info: We got a combined ticket with the Conciergerie for 12.50 Euros, normally 16.50 if purchased separately."

These guys were masters of elements; they had to mix sand, wood grain, and elements such as cadmium (yellow) or cobalt (blue) to get the correct colors. What is more is that each stained glass panel tells a story of the bible, from creation of the world to the end of the world! So you can imagine there are a lot of panels.

The upper chapel has one of the most extensive collections of 13th century stained glass having survived the French Revolution. Chairs are provided for soaking up the atmosphere and just gazing at the amazing stained glass. Plan to spend a couple of hours here. There can be fairly long lines to enter so either come early or go through the line for the adjacent Justice Building which is usually shorter and allows you to go through the chapel as well."

The walls so none existent people wondered how the roof stood. This lack of walls allows for an amazing array of beautiful stained glass windows. Despite damage during the French Revolution and in an ill-advised retrofit for use as an archive depository in 1803, two-thirds of the windows are original, and thus the program for the narrative of the windows can be discerned. Commissioned by Louis IX to look like a reliquary, the windows use biblical stories to portray a model of kingship and warnings of bad kingship. Whether or not you understand medieval narrative or iconography does not matter, the sheer beauty of the interior is breathtaking. It is small compared to Notre Dame, but so much more beautiful and inspiring. Worth a trip for this alone. It is one of the only things I regularly visit when I come to Paris."

Nowhere is this more apparent than at Sainte Chapelle, near Notre Dame. After several attempts, in what is supposed to be a down season for tourism because of cold and rain, we simply gave up. Our idea of a vacation is not to stand with the other sheep in the rain -- we can be damp, cold and miserable at home. The piece de resistance was a sign informing those foolish enough to buy the Paris Museum Pass, which is supposed to put you in another, shorter, lineup, that the Pass was being disregarded. Get in line and shut up. For those dumb enough to buy the Pass, Beware. It may (somewhere other than Sainte Chapelle) abate your misery, but it will not solve it. We cooled down (figuratively, not literally, because it was 10 degrees C and raining) by doing a walking tour of the adjacent parts of the city, which is still to be recommended.

The chapel has two levels, a smaller chapel below, a larger one on top with high ceilings. There's a restoration project going on now until 2014 I think, so one side of the window was blocked when I was there. Despite this, I think it's still worth a visit.

In fact, we couldn't believe that there could possibly be anything more beautiful to be seen on the upper level. Of course, we were wrong. We were stunned by the magnificence and beauty. We didn't visit with a group so it meant we could take all the time we needed to truly enjoy this experience.

It was just beautiful.We only found out it was happening due the seeing a flyer posted near our apartment - and literally had 30 minutes to get there in time for the show.

Tour books said to pass through the\" relatively plain lower level.\" This, too, is an error.First of all, that lower level is only plain in comparison to a Bernini-decorated Baroque church in Rome. Don't run past the lower level en route to the upstairs! You've waited a long time in line, so don't by pass this.There is no way to adequately describe the upper level. More window than wall, the structure is very nearly luminescent. Even from the outside it doesn't seem possible that the roof can stand on such slender pillars with no visible arches or buttresses or support of any kind. As we came up the small spiral stairs from the lower level, the sun suddenly came from behind the clouds and I went absolutely weak in the knees from the beauty. Even with several windows blocked for renovations, the light was complete.A word about the lines -- I know this is very difficult for the authorities because Sainte-Chapelle sits in the courtyard of the Supreme Court and Department of Justice. Permitting access at all must be a tremendous challenge for security of all the spaces. There are several steps to the security, and once inside there are few facilities. I'm just saying that the access and visiting is really hard to negotiate, but even with this you simply must allow time and patience to see Sainte-Chapelle. It's a miracle that it survived the Republic! It is a gift! Enjoy!"

This was my first to Sainte-Chapelle and it has spoiled Notre Dame for me forever. Sainte-Chapelle is a small chapel. Though it is very close to Notre Dame and they are both Gothic architecture, they are quite different. Sainte-Chapelle is a small jewel in comparison to the hulking Notre Dame. The beautiful light pouring through the ancient stained glass windows of Sainte-Chapelle dominates the interior. Much of the glass in Sainte-Chapelle is original to the 12th/13th century and is extremely bright and colorful and tells an intricate Biblical story, whereas most of the glass in Notre Dame is much more modern and much less colorful and beautiful and is just somewhat boringly patterned. The walls and ceilings in Sainte-Chapelle are beautifully painted and decorated. There is a good chance that Notre Dame was beautifully decorated in the past when it was built but much of that decoration is now gone. Sainte-Chapelle has very little stone structure to it as seen from the inside - it seems to be mostly glass - whereas Notre Dame, though a Gothic cathedral and thus glass rich, has comparatively much less glass. Sainte-Chapelle is now undergoing restoration of its stained glass windows so a large part (maybe 1/4) of the windows were covered and not visible. That was disappointing but it will ensure that the beautiful glass will endure and be visible long in the future. Also, the interior painting could use restoration. In many places it had blistered and peeled off. Hopefully, someday that will also be restored as it was a couple of hundred years ago to make it look new again. Sainte-Chapelle was well worth a visit and I probably will never pass it up again when I visit Paris."

There is not always someone outside watching the line and setting up a separate priority line for pass holders, so be prepared to wait even if you have a pass. Once we passed the security check, we were luckily able to skip the long line for tickets, which was just as long as the first line.It was an on-and-off rainy afternoon, so our visit would have been better timed on a more sunny day to fully illuminate the windows. The stained-glass windows were still impressive, but it was disappointing that maybe one-fifth of the windows were covered while undergoing restoration, and we could hear construction going on. Still, considering that our Museum Passes lessened our waiting time in line and paid for our admission, visiting Sainte-Chapelle was definitely worth it, and I knew I would have regretted missing it if we didn\u2019t go."

I'll leave it off the itinerary next time. We went towards the end of the day but plenty of daylight to see the stained glass. I was surprised at the cost - 9.50 euros to get in. Definitely not worth it. Although half of the chapel was under construction and the windows on that side were not visible, even if they were, I don't think it is worth $13 dollars. We walked in, nodded our heads a few times and were done. Frankly, the stained glass windows in Notre Dame are as good or more grandiose. I also would suggest that they provide some sort of signage to guide you where to go after going through security. With how many visit, you would think you could find the chapel without having to ask where it is. Again, perhaps some people really like this, but for the price, I don't think it is worth it."

The lower one is quickly visited, the restoration works are very unbalanced with a splendid ceiling but poorly maintained painted murals. The top floor is much more impressive with its very high and narrow stained glass windows and rose, but about one third of the windows were undergoing refection and are not visible. Whereas in other historic sites the invisible area is covered by a copy of the artwork, the whole area here is boxed in white planks and the logo of the sponsor, and that is quite a terrible thing to see in one of the holiest and most emblematic places of worship in Europe. I would recommed you'd pass until the restoration works are over and buy instead postcards of the chapel as its most beautiful."

It was a feat of gothic architecture to move the weight of the roof via flying buttresses to the ground and so free the walls to be thin enough to be mostly stained glass. The colors of much of these windows were a trade secret which even modern science can't replicate. Go even if the line seems long; it moves quickly, and for god's sake do not let them know you are more than a group of 4 (spread out a little if you have to) or they may refuse you admission. This is free the first Sunday in each month and also to kids under 18 with international student ID.

We chose the most expensive tickets since it was a special occasion, and since within the ticket categories the seating is first-come first-served, we ended up with front row seats! I was thrilled. The players were lively and the music was beautiful, as you would expect it to be. A few additional pieces were played in addition to Vivaldi's, making the concert about 1 hour long. I would really recommend this to classical music fans - it is one of THE most beautiful places you will go to see a concert!One note - no heating or A/C in the chapel, so dress for the weather (hat/gloves or small hand-fan, etc)."

You can use your museum pass, which if you plan to visit a few museums and/or cathedrals, that is the way to go. We bought our pass here since it was the first place we hit, but it would be smart to buy your pass at one of the other museums first since we could have went right in and not have to wait in line if we had the passes first. The chapel is on the grounds of the justice palace, so you do have to go through security and there are sign everywhere of what you cannot bring in. Leave your forks at home or else they may be confiscated. I was worried about my cork screw (as I always have one in my purse), but they never took that. You enter on the ground floor. It is a bit dark, but the colors are amazing. They have their souvenir shop right in this area which distracts a bit from the beauty of the chapel. Once you have viewed the downstairs, you can take the spiral staircase to the top. It was not that difficult of a climb and there were a lot of older people that made it up to the top. Breath taking. The stained glass is incredible and it is hard to take it all in as there is so much to see. Each of the stained glass windows tells a story, but if you have any ADD, you will have difficulty focusing to get to that story, well, at least I did, anyway. I think if there were not so many people there, I could have stayed there for hours. They are restoring and cleaning the glass, so one of the panels was completely covered. You can see where they have and have not cleaned yet. I imagine if you time your visit right and get there when the late afternoon sun beams through these windows the reflecting light must be spectacular. It was breathtaking when we were there and it was a cloudy day. Once you exit, you leave through the justice court yard. The gates here are amazing too. Worth a photo or two."

If you visit Notre Dame Cathedral, by all means take a walk a couple of streets to the West and find La Sainte-Chapelle. We were there on a sunny day in May, and there was a line, but it moved fast and there was no charge. At the entrance around back, notice the Biblical carvings of Christ, Noah\u2019s Ark and others. Looking at such an array of depictions, it was very nearly the Bible told in stone. As we stepped inside, there were people just standing and gazing up toward the high stained glass windows. We soon followed suit. No one can help being in awe of such a colorful setting. You can take your time, as there was no time limit. La Sainte-Chapelle is on the island of Ile de la Cite in the Seine as Notre Dame Cathedral."

However, I'm glad I got to see pre/post reno stained glass. There is a video playing showing the process each piece of glass goes through and it gives you an incredible appreciation for the already-finished pieces and what they are currently undertaking. This place is a gem, and it is located just a few blocks from Notre Dame and close to other places like Pont Neuf.

The ground level is all hand painted in beautiful colors and is where the common people worshiped. Up a winding little staircase to the second level is a grand chapel painted in light streaming through a multitude of stained glass windows where the rich and royal worshiped.

We went over while passing the \u00cele de la Cit\u00e9 without even planning to get in there (we had planned it a few days before, but it was closed at that time). The line was not as long as most people tend to state it is, so we decided to try it out. As EU citizens under 26, we did not need to pay anything for the tickets. But even if one has to pay to enter, it is definitely worth it.The security seemed tight, but the people working there were nice and it was not a bother. But they would take dangerous stuff from people trying to enter and would never return it, so be advised if you wish to have a kitchen knife or something like that (for what ever reasons). The bottom floor was not too special. I have to say, as a person who had not done much reading about the Chappel, I was a little bit disappointed at first. But once we got up to the next floor, it got breath-taking. It was easily the most beautiful Church I had ever seen (and I have seen quite a few). The only downside was the fact that the windows were in the process of renovation. Most of them had already been cleaned, but a few were covered (because the glass was taken out for cleaning) and some had not been cleaned yet. So it was not as amazing as it could have been. But that was a few months ago, so I guess it should be finished by now.P.S. Before you leave the area, make sure you enter the Palais de Justice. Going through the security for Sainte-Chapelle is the only way for unauthorized personnel to enter the palace. It is not exactly a tourist attraction, as it is actually a working court palace, but the sheer size of it and the architecture is something worth seeing. Especially since it is free."

The lower is pretty much devoid of light but the intense decor and colour is impressive. The upper chapel is where the stained glass resides that everyone raves about. It is impressive and vast but there is little else to see if stained glass is not your thing. I think three of the windows were being restored as part of an ongoing project while we were there and were completely covered, so we did not get the full effect."

In the chapel itself, you have to climb some narrow spiral stairs to get into the main Chapel, where you are met with THE most incredible stained glass you will probably ever see. Incredible stuff. One wall is being renovated, but the rest are all there in their ancient, shining glory. Amazing."

It is very small but make sure to go to the upper room. There are some small stairs to go up and then BAM there are these beautiful stained glass windows that are stunning. Again some people gave some bad reviews but that is really the only reason to come here. If you aren't into this then it might not be your cup of tea. Plus the morning sun was coming in and it lit up most of the windows. My Dad creates and build stained glass windows so this was a treat for us.

Also, the ticket includes the Consierge next door so its worth the price for two! Go and enjoy!"

The ground floor level (for the commoners) has some stunning frescoes, but is the upstairs royal chapel that really takes your breath away. The walls are almost entirely stained glass, extending right up to the vaulted ceiling, and with only narrow columns between. As mentioned by other reviewers, restoration of the glass is taking place, so a good quarter of the windows is hidden behind a screen - this does detract from the sensation, but it is still well worth seeing. We went on a dull, overcast day, and I would suggest that (as all the illumination comes from outside) a bright sunny day would be even better.We also attended a concert which was excellent, but very very cold. Make sure you are rugged up in winter, and try to get there early for the best seats.On your way out, take time for another look at the ground floor - everybody is in a hurry to get upstairs to see the glass, and the exquisite quality of the little chapel is often overlooked."

When we were there, the air in the upper chapel was filled with dust because of work being performed.

It is hard to believe that people could conceive, design and construct this gem in the Middle Ages. It is perhaps equally hard to believe it survived through so many wars and revolutions. It loses a star as a tourist attraction not for any shortcoming in the work of those artists and builders, but for the way it is run. The admission cost is a bit high for such a one-dimensional attraction, although I suppose the long lines mean the market bears that price. The vaunted museum pass does not get you ahead of the long line to get inside, although it can save you time on the second line once you get through the first. A dedicated entry for museum passes would be preferable. The concerts are wonderful (we attended Vivaldi's Four Seasons; the musicians were excellent and the venue is, as noted, beautiful) -- but they are fairly expensive and are marketed in three price tiers to snare unsuspecting tourists into paying up to 15 Euros extra for essentially the same seats, given that the venue is so small that no seats are that far apart. Finally, there is no mention before you pay that a huge scrim is blocking a quarter of the beautiful stained glass walls, which are under restoration -- and this certainly must be a relevant factor that should be disclosed when they are using the beauty of the venue to induce the expensive ticket sales in the first place. That doesn't mean I wouldn't go anyway -- I'd go again, for sure -- but I don't see the purpose in leaving me with the feeling that I've been a little bit taken, when I could have been left with the feeling that I'd been treated well. Anyway, that's my story and I'm stickin' to it."

Unfortunately, it is a Gothic cathedral, and, while magnificent, central heating is/was not an option, and tonight was particularly chilling. I brought a scarf and wrapped it around my head. If you go, even in spring, wear boots, heavy socks, etc. Believe me, it is worth it!The church was damaged during the French Revolution, but managed to retain a lot of the stained glass.

Apparently per the pamphlet, \" 22 relics..., including the fragment of the Holy Cross and Crown of Thorns used to be displayed,... but were melted down during the Revolution\". The stained glass is nice, but I'm not sure it is worth 8.5 Euros. I spent more time in line than reviewing the fresco and dusty statues. Also, you can purchase an audio guide for like 4.5 Euros or download the app from the App Store. Don't do the app. They have a weak WIFI signal, and it would have taken an hour just to download the images, so I gave up after 20 mins.I did not see a concert, was not an option when I was there.

While checking the top rated attractions of Paris on tripadvisor while planning my trip last august, I saw Sainte-Chapelle was rated very high, somewhere in the top 5 Paris attractions (I think it was in the top 3 in august), so I though it must be a must-see attraction. As far as I'm concerned this was one of the underwhelming attractions in our 3 days in Paris as my expectations were probably too high (maybe seeing the top 3 position on tripadvisor in august 2012 made me expect too much). The queue was long enough to be annoying (40-50 minutes), the price quite high for such a short visit (about 8.5 euro for a 20 minutes visit) and the experience was not a top one. To me it seems like this is not a top 5 Paris attraction. I really loved Paris, probably the most from the cities visited so far, but neither Notre Dame, Saint Chapelle, Sacre Coeur or Madeleine interiors succeeded in leaving me a strong enough impression, at least compared to some italian (and other) churches. And at least Sacre Coeur and Notre Dame have better settings and are much easier to admire from outside than Sainte Chapelle, which is crowded between other buildings (otherwise the outside architecture of the chapel is beautiful) . Don't get me wrong, the upper chapel with its stained glass is quite nice (but did not seem as nice as I've seen it in some pictures), I just feel the queues and the high entry fee (compared with length of the visit) spoil the experience. I wanted to give it a 3 star rating based on my experience/impressions, but objectively I think this is a 4 stars attraction which is dragged down by some negatives."

When I saw the long queue for Sainte-Chapelle at 1pm, I considered skipping this but I am so grateful I went inside. Both the downstairs and upper chapel are beautiful. I took many pictures, but doubt any of those photos could capture how beautiful this chapel is. I only wished that it was not so crowded. As the main attraction is the stained glass, I agree that a sunny afternoon is a good time to visit. Nevertheless, I noticed that before 10:00 there was no queue. Please note, the inside of the chapel can get VERY cold."

After 4 hours, I still did not want to leave. There are free guide tours (in French), otherwise you can rent an audioguide (which is very helpful). You may need to brush up on your history and religion classes before coming here, or come back again and again. At this moment, a small section is closed for restauration. A MUST."

This might be my favorite church of all of the ones I visited in London, Paris, and Rome on this trip. I knew little about this church other than it was one my husband wanted to see based on guidebook reviews. It is in a government complex that houses courts, so there is a security screening on the outside of the complex. After we got through that, we used the Paris Museum Pass for entry and walked right in through the downstairs entrance. Once inside I thought, \"okay, this is a pretty little church, lovely windows and altar with a nice little gift shop. Not that big of a deal.\" We looked around for ten minutes, took a couple photos, and turned to leave. Then, as we walked to the back of the church, we noticed two small staircases on either side leading upstairs. To the upper chapel. Duh.A few short steps up and we understood what all of the fuss was about. Over sixteen hundred square feet of panoramic stained glass in vivid color. Just gorgeous. Even with 1/8 of the panels covered for reconstruction work, this chapel had our jaws hanging open. When done at Ste. Chapelle, you can take a look inside the Justice building also in the complex if interested. As for Conciergerie on the shared ticket with Ste. Chapelle and also on the museum pass, I would only go there if you had nothing else to see that day, as we didn't find that particularly interesting.If you do want to see the Conciergerie, you have to exit the complex security gates and go left about half a block to get to that entrance. Don't bother looking for signs inside the complex to direct you to the Conciergerie, as there are none."

It's not as well-kept a secret as it used to be, though the entrance through the Police prefecture makes it a bit of a trek to get through. The stained glass windows are incredible, as are the painted walls; however, I was disappointed this time around that a large section of one wall is covered in scaffolding for window restoration. Unlike many restoration projects, where the scaffolding is just on the outside, this scaffolding is also on the inside of the chapel, contracting the already small space and limited the amount of light that streams in through the windows. It's worth it, of course; the restored windows are absolutely stunning. It's still not to be missed, but if you haven't seen it before, make sure to come back in a few years when the restoration is complete!"

There's a line for the security check, but nothing too long, and if you appreaciate stained glass art or are a religious person, am sure it would be worth the waiting even if the lines were long.

Though you might be surprised that you waited in a long queue and paid almost 10 euro just to get into small chapel for several minutes, don't be sorry, this place has a history and is really beautiful. Maybe a little too many shops for such space, but hey, they need money to renew all of it, right?"

I'm grateful we persevered because the architecture, stained glass windows, and gorgeous artefacts are stunning to behold. I've been to several churches throughout Europe (including the Vatican) which are all gorgeous in their own right, but Sainte-Chapelle is stunning in its own way. Every time I find myself in Paris, I will be visiting Sainte-Chapelle."

The upper chapel has full-length stained glass windows that make you feel as if you are in a box of jewels ... and every surface is painted in ethereal blue and gold.

Sainte-Chapelle is an often-missed attraction in Paris because it is hidden inside the police compound, and is not a very big structure compared to nearby Notre Dame. But you MUST go in, because there is nothing else quite like it. It is a 13th Century jewel box of stained glass! Downstairs is a small chapel with a patterned ceiling, and upstairs is the chapel itself. The columns and buttresses that hold up the roof are so thin and the 85 windows of glass 50 feet high are so vast and beautiful that colored light seems to be born in the room.Since Sainte-Chapelle is just across the street from Notre Dame, it is very convenient to visit. You can also visit The Conciergerie at the same time. The latter was a palace turned into a prison at the time of the French Revolution, and many condemned people spent there last nights there before being taken to the guillotine. The Conciergerie has various related displays, including an old guillotine blade.There are stairs leading to the upper chapel of Sainte-Chapelle, and I don't remember if there is an elevator for people in wheelchairs. There is a gift shop with some very nice books on the chapel, post cards, etc.In 2012, the entrance fee for Sainte-Chapelle was $9 USD, but if you buy a Museum Pass when you arrive in Paris, you can visit as many of these sites as you want over a week-long period and not be concerned about entry fees or standing in line. We have never been to Paris without stopping in to have our breath taken away by Sainte-Chapelle, and we have never taken anyone there without them being grateful."

La Sainte-Chapelle is a royal medieval Gothic chapel, located near the Palais de la Cit\u00e9, on the \u00cele de la Cit\u00e9 in the heart of Paris, France.Begun some time after 1239 and consecrated on the 26th of April 1248,[1] the Sainte-Chapelle is considered among the highest achievements of the Rayonnant period of Gothic architecture. Its erection was commissioned by King Louis IX of France to house his collection of Passion Relics, including Christ's Crown of Thorns - one of the most important relics in medieval Christendom.With the Palais de la Cit\u00e9, today called La Conciergerie, the Sainte-Chapelle is one of the surviving buildings of the Capetian royal palace on the \u00cele de la Cit\u00e9. Although damaged during the French revolution, and restored in the 19th century, it retains one of the most extensive in-situ collections of 13th century stained glass anywhere in the world."

You enter the lower chapel which was for the ordinary folk and climb up a steep winding stair to the upper chapel where used to be the shrine for relics from Jerusalem. The overall effect of the tall thin stained glass windows is memorable. Most of the glass is original and important for its early date. But some of the lower panels are reproduction. The scenes in each smallish oval panel are difficult to read without binoculars and some kind of guide is essential. These glass walls are definitely something to be seen but strangely it did make me uncomfortable that these gorgeous treasures were so exclusive and solely the preserve of the King and his court."

The initial room is mainly just the gift shop, you will need to climb the staircase which is slightly hidden in the corners of the main room. Once you get to the chapel, you will understand. It is made up of almost floor to ceiling stained glass windows covering every wall. On a sunny day, it is absolutely breathtaking. Even on not so sunny days, the windows are just gorgeous.

They could do an entire fundraising campaign based on photos of the looks on people's faces when they first enter the space. I second a former review about accessibility as there are many stairs - understandable as this is a historic site but definitely something visitors should be aware of.We came back later for a concert - overrated as the musicianship was fine but nothing spectacular. Buy the Museum Pass and come midday when the sun will be shining through the windows."

This is why lines are long you must go through security you are entering a secure area. Its similar to the airport security. Walk through metal detector and pocket stuff and carry items go in bins to be x-rayed. Knowing this the line will go faster if you have pockets emptied and everything ready to go in a bin. Tip: The restrooms are in a building to the far left with an underground entrance. If they are closed you can turn right and go in to the courthouse for restrooms on the main floor far right. The wait is worth seeing what is truly the most magnificent stained glass in the city. All the years I had seen this jewel box of a place on TV it didn't prepare me for the overwhelming feeling of seeing it in person. The main floor is the gift shop area and your first glimpse at the beauty of the painted walls. You then climb a small winding staircase to be met by immense windows. We were the last tour of the day so we watched the sun start to set and the room grow darker. The building is under a major restoration and conservation. There will be a section blocked off as they work around the room until 2014. Its a learning experience to see the work rather than a deterrent to see this beautiful piece of history."

First, there is usually a line to get in as the church is on the grounds of Ministry of Justice, so there is extra security. Then, you head over and out to the church where you pay and enter. You enter the gift shop, which you usually see at the end. It was nice with some good looking items, but I still had no idea what to expect. As you head up to the chapel itself, you can see why it is so very impressive. There are cards which explain the panels in many different languages so you can get the most out of the visit. Don't just walk in and walk out, but take the time to really see the details, to really look at this masterpiece. This is a must see when in Paris."

For my money, the Sainte-Chappelle blows Notre Dame out of the water. It's much smaller and not as much of an architectural feat, but its beauty cannot be understated. The stained glass reaches from floor to ceiling and goes around 360 degrees. This is a must see in Paris.And don't be fooled when you first get there by what's on the ground floor, you have to go upstairs to see the stained glass."

As with a number of attractions in Paris, you have to go through a security scan to get access to Sainte-Chapelle since the church sits within a complex of judicial Buildings. The minor inconvenience is worth it however. The ground floor of Sainte-Chapelle is interesting enough as a spectacle, even if it is a bit dark, but the real significance of the building lies up the winding stairs in the corner of the ground floor room. On coming out of the staircase you enter a magnificent room that is dominated by massive floor-to-ceiling 360 degree stained glass windows. It was overcast the morning we visited but the light in the room was still breathtaking. One can only wonder what it would be like to see it all on a sunny day. It must be truly magnificent. The crowds may have been along the way at Notre Dame. We were with the discerning few enjoying the stunning beauty of Sainte-Chapelle."

You will be dazzled by the floor to ceiling, 360 degree stained glass windows of rich ruby, sapphire, emerald, amethyst... This is the most magical human-made space I have ever experienced. Even if you are not a religious person, you will feel a sense of awe and spirituality here. It simply is impossible to be disappointed by Sainte Chapelle\u2014just make sure to go to the second floor. This is where the actual chapel is. I\u2019ve seen people who mistook the first floor as the chapel, and they walked away angry. Don\u2019t do this! Climb the spiral steps; and when you make the final turn of the spiral, you will emerge into a breathtaking piece of heaven!TIP: The chapel is a little more difficult to find than most Parisian landmarks as it is hidden inside the huge justice complex. There are small signs, however, to point the way. You will also have to go through some serious guards and a metal detector\u2014since this is an operating court. Once you are inside the complex\u2019s courtyard, there will be bathrooms in a little sunken area to your left (I believe)\u2014take your own toilet paper and purrell, just in case! You\u2019ll likely see the line leading to Sainte Chapelle on the opposite side of the bathroom area. I advise that you get to the church as soon as it opens. The light filters in most beautifully through the morning angles. Plus, the empty church allows you to soak in the beauty a little more deeply. You might also revisit the church at night during one of its many concerts. The windows will be dark, but the atmosphere will still be divine."

Entrance is free for under 26-year olds (It was my 26th birthday that day but they let me in for free). Still worth the price though if you have to pay. Very steep spiral staircase to go to the upper level. Go on a sunny day to really see the beauty of the stained glass windows. Some windows are currently being restored so can't be seen."

Instead it was intimate. Because of this intimacy, it was possible to imagine the king worshipping there in private. It's well worth a visit, especially if it's a sunny day and the stained glass can really glow. It was impossible to capture the \"reality\" of the place\" in photos, so I'm included my impression with these swirling photos.

You line up on the street just to get into the complex and then continue to line up to actually get into the building. There is no separate line anywhere for museum pass holders although they are supposed to be able to skip the queue. I took my chances and went to the front of the first line and a nice pair of ladies let me go ahead of them when they saw my pass. I thanked them and told them that if I was not entitled to go ahead I would go back to the end of the line. We continued on to the second line (again no separate area for pass holders) and a woman came out and shouted for pass holders to go with her. About 6 of us stepped out of line and followed her right into the church. I saved myself at least an hour of waiting in the rain. Once inside I found out that to have an audioguide you must buy a ticket from the booth outside....I asked if I needed to wait in the ticket buying line and I was told to just go to the front of the line and pay and bring back my receipt. I did and it went very quickly. While I was very happy to not have to wait, it was very awkward to keep jumping in front of people in line who had been waiting a long time to use the benefits of my pass. It would be better if they had a separate line for pass holders.All of that being said, it is a wonderful building. It is absolutely majestic. The windows are amazing and much more intensely colored than any others I saw in Paris (in MANY churches). The history of it is also very interesting particularly if you make the trip to Chateau Vincennes and visit the Sainte Chapelle there. It is not a huge place but it has a wonderful feeling to it.There are concerts here occasionally, they sell about 200 tickets and the concerts are held in the upper chapel. If you just want to get a peek this is a way to see half of the building and see a show at the same time, minimal waiting in line required. I used the web site www.classictic.com and was able to print out a ticket at home. My second visit to Sainte Chapelle was for a concert of Vivaldi - Four Seasons, Handel - Serabande and Albinoni - Adagio. The acoustics were wonderful and the venue was perfect."

Really take your time to examine the upper level, grab one of the laminated pages in the corner with a detailed description of each pane, watch the video on all the intricate work that goes into making stained glass windows like these. It will really increase the \"wow\" factor. One helpful note - there were two queues to get into the Sainte-Chapelle area: one for the church and one for the Palace of Justice. The Palace line was markedly shorter, but came out into the same square as the longer line for the church. Note that this was not in peak season and might be somehow different in the summer, but if the lines are very uneven, hop in the Palace line and it will still get you to the church.Also - this is free with a museum pass."

It is a chapel that held important religious relics, including, at one time, Christ's Crown of the Thorns. It was designed in the Rayonnant style, a form of French Gothic Architecture, in the 13th century, when the goal of Gothic Art was to extend farther into a kind of lightness, to reach higher to God, if you will, and to create an artistic manifestation of this quest for the spiritual, through exquisite and refined architectural details and beautiful stained glass windows that illustrated the Bible for the public. The \"walls\" of glass of the Sainte-Chapelle are a superb example. By now, anyone traveling anywhere, should expect lines and security when entering well-known, and important historic and cultural attractions. We in the United States are used to it in Washington, DC and New York City for example. France, England and other parts of Europe are no different. If you are pressed for time and are trying to cram most of Paris into a 3 to 4 day visit, this may not be an attraction to view on a visit first. It may be better kept for a return trip when you want to do more than just scratch the surface or see \"highlights.\" It is a magnificent and inspirational architectural masterpiece of the Middle Ages, and the stained glass windows, well, they will just about knock your socks off!"

It's the summit of the so-called 'radiant' gothic style, and gives you a stunning look into the architectural capacities of the 13th century medieval chuch builders. The famous saint/king Louis IX built it as a depository for the many relics he imported after his disastrous crusade to the Holy Land in the late 13th century. It's actually one big ornamented case in stained-glass, every inch is beautifully decorated in gothic style. It gives me a magic feeling knowing all the late medieval French kings had their prayers here. There were restorations going on (almost always, unfortunately), but these were nicely hidden and didn't ruin the atmosphere. Only the crowd of tourists may have been distracting and sometimes annoying. As students we didn't have to pay. Terrific experience!"

An information board gave details of the renovation process: how they were restoring the glass to its former glory. Once these renovations are complete this place will be truly magnificent.As it was, it still held a magical quality, and you couldn't help but be truly awed. If there's a more beautiful church in Europe, we didn't see it; and we visited quite a few. This place is a must do while in Paris."

Nearly half of one side is being refurbished so we could not see it, it seems that this church has undergone refurbishment for as long as I can remember.Still, seeing the stained glass is great and always memorable. There used to be more places to sit and just marvel at the glass, not as much any more.A not to be missed attraction which will take your breath away."

However the hidden gem and the breathtaking part is to come right after climbing some steps up to the upper floor. Any stained-glasses lover would die for a glimpse of them.Depicting the whole Bible stories, it really worths the visit. Just take a seat and gaze into the glasses and let time pass.Warning 1: They have been doing restoration works which means some windows are covered nowadays.Warning 2: Come early or stand in a huge line. Or, cleverer, buy your tickets in advance, jump the queue and save lots of time!"

People line up to pass through security (this line cannot be jumped) but once inside, a second line can be jumped with the pass.Once inside, ascend some spiral stairs to the upper level and enjoy the wonderful stained glass. There are information boards as you enter the room that explain the pictures in the glass.

The official start of the show is 7 PM, the Classictic.com advises to arrive early, at 6:15 PM. We would take it even a notch early, especially if the intention is to get best seats available in your section/category. The lines are quite long, one has to move through almost the entire Palais de Justice to reach the La Chapelle. The interior is fabulous, and so are the acoustics; the musician were doing a very good job.

It was absolutely more beautiful than stained glass that I had ever seen elsewhere.Plus, this museum is located about a one minute walk from the Consergerie - where Marie Antionette was kept until she was killed. If you are visiting Notre Dame, it's about a 5-10 minute walk. It's gorgeous and also convenient to other sites. Don't miss going to Sainte-Chapelle."

There are 2 levels to the chapel - the bottom (entry) level is where the common folk would be allowed to pray, and it is still gorgeous and dramatic, with a beautiful medieval arched ceiling. But it's the upper, royal level of the chapel that takes your breath away. It is the most dramatic display of stained glass I've ever seen, reaching from the wainscoting all the way up thirty feet or more, on all 4 sides of the narrow building. The stained glass is undergoing a much needed cleaning and restoration, which is really the only good thing about missing it all those other visits, since the unrestored section doesn't yet have the jewel-box brilliance of the restored sections. There is intricate detail on every surface from the floor to the ceiling, on the altar canopy, over the doors, etc. I am not a religious person, but this building is a testament to mankind's artistry and engineering skills. Do not miss it! It is well worth the wait in line to get in. (Be aware that they check very carefully for anything with sharp edges and will confiscate anything that could be damaging, like penknives and tweezers, etc.) You can combine a visit to Sainte Chapelle with a visit to the Conciergerie, which is worth the visit if you are at all interested in Marie Antionette and/or the French Revolution."

Louis IX had this Gothic masterpiece built in the 13th Century to originally house the relics of the Passion of Christ. You start in the lower commoners' chapel, dark and richly decorated with intricate columns and arches but nothing prepares you for the King's upper chapel surrounded by soaring stained glass windows (over 6000 sq ft) that seem to defy any rules of architecture. They are dense and richly coloured and depict every story in the bible with the famous later 15th century Rose window telling the story of John's revelation. The audio guide was Euro .5 and went into extraordinary detail of each window if you are interested. There is a marvellous film about the restoration of the windows, which is going on at the moment and covering a section of the chapel but I think is additionally interesting rather than detracting from the beauty.Even on just a weekend trip, this would definitely feature as a MUST-DO - it's extraordinary."

I don't think a static image could faithfully reproduce the awe anyway. The chapel is an integral part of the Palais de la Cit\u00e9, originally the Palais de Saint-Louis for Louis IX who had it built and went on to become a saint. He bought the relics that were once housed there, in 1239, for the \"considerable sum of 135 000 pounds\" which contained Christ's crown of thorns. It's a veritable joy to find yourself within the chapel's walls."

They play easy listening baroque (Four Seasons, Pachelbel Canon) so you know the musicians are slumming it, but they were spectacular even so and gave it there all. You can buy tickets at the door, which is cheaper than paying online or through your hotel. We bought the 30 euro seats, which is right behind the front VIP section. Oh, be warned, right now in September, half of Saint-Chapelle is under renovation, which blocks half the stained glass. So you may want to wait a while before going.

Its covered by Museum Pass but the pass will not help you with the security line - you can skip the ticket line but that is rarely long.If you don't want to spring for the Pass, think about getting the dual Sainte-Chapelle/Conciergerie ticket..

The violin performance was fine, however, instead of the concert being in the main sanctuary, it was in another room with some stained glass and construction work. We had thought for paying 25 Euros for a one-hour concert, advertized as being at Saint-Chapelle, it would have used the accoustics and grandeur of the sanctuary, but not so. The price of the concert did not even include a visit to the sanctuary, so we skipped this during our one-week visit to Paris. This was very disappointing. A tip is to skip Saint-Chapelle - Notre Dame is free, as is Saine-Genevieve and many others."

The wait could be a hassle but I had a museum pass and walked past the ticket line and could have gone in a separate security entrance to bypass that line too if I had entered the queue from the opposite direction where a sign directed ticket holders to enter. This time it was still beautiful but with almost a third of the glass under construction it's not as nice. The symmetry of all the stained glass reaching to the peak of the roof was part of what I liked. With some windows covered it's still stunning but some of the effect is lost. The chapel is small so size isn't impressive, it's the lavish stained glass that is so good.  People were thoughtful and mostly quiet the day my daughters and I visited so it was a good visit. I would still recommend seeing Ste Chappelle. I haven't seen that concentrated amount of stained glass anywhere else before. I like Notre Dame, and Sacre Coeur also, but Ste Chappelle is unique in it's being almost completely stained glass, instead of the usual stained glass scattered about the churches. It's a stairway walk up to the glass windows, I don't think I saw an elevator or alternative approach for the stairs. If you don't go up the stairs and see the stained glass in the second level you will miss the real reason to see Ste-Chappelle."

It was nice being the chapel when it was not crowded but unfortunately, the chapel is undergoing renovations and so about 25% of the gorgeous windows are under wraps. It's been a lengthy process and I'm surprised we were able to view the entire chapel when we were there last year.

Some of them are closed off as they are doing them up but its still worth paying the entry and seeing this beautiful sight"

What amazes me most about St. Catherine Laboure is her heroic humility. She was an amazing woman and truly worth reading about her life. I do not think anywhere in all Christendom is there a more humble saint to be found. She was young when Mary visited her and died an old woman who never spoke of her vision except to her confessor. She worked at the humblest of tasks with the cows! I love this small corner of Paris. It is peaceful."

Don't be fooled by the \"plain\" windows on the first floor that you see as you enter. The second floor is where the kings used to go to church, so that chapel is worthy of royalty.

We didn't think it was difficult to find. It's basically just down the street from Notre Dame in the Palais of Justice. There are signs also where to line up. You do have to go through a security checkpoint (probably because it is inside the Palais of Justice). It's your average security checkpoint, you are allowed to bring in bags, just not weapons of any kind. A tourist immediately in line in front of us had to throw his pocket knife in the garbage. We went right when it opened in the morning on a Friday and didn't experience any lines at the security checkpoint or at the entrance gate. None of the employees stand out in my mind, they were neither especially rude nor especially friendly. The chapel doesn't look like much from the outside and when I saw the entrance hall on the bottom level, I was still wondering what everybody considered such a big deal. Then we climbed up the winding staircase and when I turned the corner it took my breath away! So beautiful! They were the most amazing stain glass panels I have ever seen in 30 years of traveling in Europe. Incredibly impressive--a true must see! One of the panels was covered for restoration, but most were recently cleaned and displayed in splendor. There was information in many languages on the pictures and stories on the windows and on the restoration process. It's included in the Museum Pass (which is absolutely worth getting) and children up to 18 are absolutely free. One of the highlights of our visit to Paris! I would recommend going early in the day to avoid lines."

However, we were so surprised on how small the church actually is. Basically you can see 2 small rooms about 2000 square feet each. I think admission is included if you purchase the museum pass so if you have that, it may be worth it as there is not much of a line-up to get in. Otherwise skip it."

I thought it would be wise to give folks a heads up that there is a major renovation underway inside the chapel. Although this is to be expected at times with antiquity, it really does take away from the beauty and serenity of Sainte Chapelle. The chairs that use to line both sides of the chapel have been removed and one can no longer sit in quiet contemplation while soaking in the beauty of the stain glass windows. On a sunny day with the light streaming through the panes of glass, it is still a breath-taking experience. So, go but be aware that unti 2013 you might not get the best of Sainte Chapelle."

This 13th-century chapel built for Louis IX was designed to resemble a medieval reliquary -- a kind of jewel box on a giant scale.

The is no secret that the cathedral is a masterpiece of Gothic architecture having one of the most extensive collections of 13th century stained glass anywhere in the world.The queues are usually long and waiting times may vary because you have to do a security check as the cathedral is in the garden of the Justice Palace.TIP: if you want not to wait in line too much and optimize your Paris visit I suggest you to choose a combined visit: Sainte Chappelle and Conciergerie. It costs 12.50 euro together for an adult but it worth the price. First go to the Conciergerie, 100m far from Sainte Chappelle entrance on the same street. As an indication, compared to the golden gates of the Justice Palace, Consiergerie is 50m on the right and Sainte Chepelle 50m on the left side. Buy there a combined ticket and visit Conciergerie (20-30 minutes visit time; TIP: don\u2019t end your visit here after you see the 2 big halls, continue with the rest after you pass through the souvenirs shop. Strange map, I know). After You visit Conciergerie, skip the big line of the Sainte Chapelle and go directly to the special one in front.If there is no clerk at the special line go and find the guardian that\u2019s between the 2 lines (Sainte Chappel and Justice Pallace share the same entrance and security check) and tell him you have already a ticket and he/she\u2019ll direct you. This way you\u2019ll save at least 1 hour of waiting time and see an additional monument too. Remember that between 13.00 and 14.00 Sainte Chapelle is closed."

It was commissiond by King Lous IX of France to house his collection of Passion Relics, including the Crown of Thorns -- one of the most important relics in medieval Christendom. I was able to stand in the middle of the chapel and video tape 360* of incredible Gothic architecture. It blows your mind that it first started to be built in 1239, and 9 years later consecreated! If something today takes 9 years to be built, it wouldn't be built; but then again, nothing like this has been built for centuries upon centuries. It is a must see of Paris! Words cannot describe the detail and depth of this chapel! One of my favorites of Paris!!"

We had a Paris Museum Pass, which saved us buying tickets but there was only one queue to join for the security check - we picked a time mid afternoon when it was less busy than we had seen it earlier in the day. My only observartion is that we did visit the Sainte-Chapelle straight after visiting the Notre Dame, so I think it did not seem quite as fabulous as it would have, if we had seen the Sainte-Chapelle first or had seen it on a separate occasion. Understandably it did seem quite small in comparison. It does not take a lot of time to look through but was well worth the visit."

They do not rate high mentions in the tour guides, however they are both well worth a visit, for different reasons. Our visit was in early December, so relatively low season, but still incredibly busy. There was to be a function in the afternoon, so there was a note advising that the venue would close within two hours; slowly the queue inched closer and closer, and we were sure that we would just get to the doors and they would be locked. We watched the time tick away, and we queued for almost two hours - but made it in!This is such an impressive building with ornate walls and ceilings in the chapels, gilt everywhere, and so much history. The stained glass windows are amazing. Do get an audio guide - you may feel, like us, that you have heard so many of these over Europe that you are well and truly over them - but you will miss such important information if you don't.We did have some trouble in the gift shop, trying to by certain postcards, as the women behind the counter either did not speak any English, or chose not to on that particular day, despite my feeble attempts at French and many hand gestures. In the end I just gave up and purchased something else."

We spent about 30 minutes taking it in - really beautiful. It is worth getting the museum pass to save time as you go about Paris - we didn't and we waited for about 30 minutes which wasn't that bad...but get the pass if you are going to several places and save yourself loads of time."

Once inside you will be treated with the amazing Sainte-Chapelle and its 13th century stained glass. Later you can pick out the chapel itself back on the street from its classic gothic style - it is the sole survivor of the Capetian Palace of Louis XII which once stood on the same site."

You have to be careful when you go for a concert, because the entrance is not the one used for the daytime tours. You actually enter from the ministry of justice down the street. There are signs, but it is confusing.The concert we attended was a selection of church music performed by a string quartet and a mezzo Soprano. The music was well performed, but it was all serious music with vocalist and accompaniment. It would have been more effective if there had been some instrumental music and perhaps something secular music from the period that provided a change in color.The chapel itself is shimmering walls of stained glass. It is a testament to the piety and devotion of those who built it."

The museum pass does not allow you to skip the queues as you still have to go through security. As said before, the enormous stained glass windows are awesome, but I found them difficult to interpret so I just enjoyed looking at them and contemplated the work and effort put into them. Some windows were covered due to cleaning/restoration, which did diminish the experience a bit. I admit to being underawed on entering the building, as all I could see were a few statues and a souvenir stand. But once upstairs I was pleasantly greeted by the windows. It may be worth waiting for a sunny day to view this church as it is quite gloomy, especially downstairs, and the windows might be more 'alive' with the sun shining through."

The BEST bit of information we found during our honeymoon week was a flyer announcing a free performance of Vivaldi's Guitar Concertos in a church called Saint Chapelle. We had no idea that we were in for such a treat. The acoustics were amazing, but the light was spectacular. As the tones of the small ensemble and the glorious classical guitar wafted toward the heavens, the sunset turned the stained glass windows into a kaleidoscope of light and color.

The entrance to the spectacular chapel above is via an ancient winding stone staircase. (Note: For special events there is access/egress to the main chapel level from a building next door.) The ancient stained glass surrounding all sides and soaring into the heavens is inspirational. My architecture history professor once declared it the most beutiful chapel in the world and I believe he was right. I wnet during the day when the exterior can be seen and the sunlight ours into the wonderful strained glass windows, but I was fortunate to learn there was a live chamber music performance in the chapel that very evening. I spent my last night in Paris listening to Vivialdi's \"Four Season's\" at Sainte0Chapelle. (Check out \"Music at Sainte-Chappelle.) The fabulous setting, great acoustics and lovely music brought tears to my eyes and to most of the audience. It was the highlight of my visit and a magical way to end my few days in Paris."

            "review": "Sainte-Chapelle is also a Music Box. First I have to agree with the reviewer who called Sainte-Chapelle a jewel box. Unlike Notre Dame and Chartres, the windows dominate the walls giving you the effect that the whole thing is one big stained glass window. This alone makes it worth the trip even if you've already visited dozens of cathedrals in France and Europe. But Sainte-Chapelle has the added bonus of floors that have been designed to also look like windows. This is no help to your neck because you will find yourself straining it looking up and down, and in your amazed state you will probably run into that many more people (although at least you won't step on their feet).There are two ways to visit Sainte-Chapelle. You can line up on the street and pay 8.50 Euros for adults. Or you can buy tickets to see a classical music concert in the church and visit in the evening. These tickets range from 16 Euros on up and are free for children under 10 years old.We chose the 25 Euro tickets. We bought them two days in advance (recommended because the concert was definitely sold out on a Thursday night). We purchased our tickets at the Tabac/tourist shop across the street from the Church entrance (location clearly marked on signs at entrance). The woman at the Tabac was incredibly helpful, but she only accepts cash. We arrived at the Church about 30 minutes early and entered further down the street (at #4 on the other side of the ornate gates for the Palais du Justice). At this point it's like entering an airport (except you don't have to take your shoes off) since you are entering the court building. Everyone was nice and helpful though, and you end up circling back through the court building to the back of the cathedral.Now, about the concert. Was it worth the 25 Euros? I'm on the fence on this one. Of course you can't find a more beautiful place to listen to classical music, and you will leave having noticed a lot of the fine details of the Sainte-Chapelle that you wouldn't otherwise have seen. But we were in the cheaper seats towards the back, and the weather didn't cooperate. It rained hard while we were in there and that combined with the noise on the street made it hard to hear the music well. The concert also only lasted one hour which was good news for my son, but classical music buffs might feel a little ripped off. Of course, 25 Euros is pretty cheap for classical music, so maybe it all equals out. Sainte-Chapelle is still being renovated. If you look at my 15 second Tout video clips (addresses below), you will see that part of the church is hidden by a big box. And yes that detracts somewhat from the experience, so it might be a good idea to plan another trip to Paris when the work is done. I'm just glad to see that the French are working hard to preserve their national treasures.Tout clips:http://www.tout.com/m/osn7ylhttp://www.tout.com/m/ju4mlvhttp://www.tout.com/m/hjvwe1http://www.tout.com/m/uq0zlihttp://www.tout.com/m/jw8zt7"

Sainte-Chapelle was under construction in May 2012 when I visited, but it didn't take away very much from the overall experience.It's a relatively small chapel, built to house one of the instruments of the passion (the crown of thorns) in a small altar. The upper level, with the altar, is covered with amazing 15-or so foot tall stained glass windows on all four sides. The room is absolutely breath taking. The place is small, so it can get congested, but it's certainly worth visiting."

Still extremely beautiful now. The bad: Gift shop on first floor seems crass and takes away from the historic and religiously important room. \u00a0Not much to see beyond the glass. The few relics not lost in the revolution are now housed in the treasury at Notre Dame. Info: \u00a0I was surprised at the fee to enter \u20ac8.50, but because it is not an active church and the great work being done, I understand. However, if money or time are limited, I would prefer the free access to Notre Dame a block away."

This church was commissioned by Louie IX in 1239. To see a structure of such beauty built so long ago was just amazing. The colors are vibrant and the entire structure is a feast for the eyes. It's one of the smaller churches, but it's not to be missed."

I did not have to wait an hour in line like all the other pissed off tourists who obviously did not read this site. Outside on the sidewalk of the complex that houses Sainte-Chapelle, there are two lines. The very long one on the left is for Sainte-Chapelle. There is a much shorter line, sometimes no line on the right, that goes to the Palais du Justice. They both go to the same courtyard, but most people do not know that you can just wait in the Palais du Justice line. You can. And doing so will cut your idle time by at least an hour if not more.That said, I don't really recommend this church unless you have an inclusive package like the Museum Pass and are in the Ile de la Cite to visit Notre Dame anyway. I would not place this church on my A list of places to be. Yes, it is really pretty and you can take a lot of nice photos, but unless you are really into churches, I think it is something of a ripoff at 8.5E just because there are so many free churches in Europe that you don't need to pay so much to see this one. In my opinion, the photos you see of this church is pretty much it. But admittedly, I am somewhat ambivalent to buildings, even very pretty buildings. I mean, it's not as if you did not see Paris if you missed this particular church. Also what soured my trip was that the first time we went, all the workers in the Ile de la Cite were on strike. That meant that we waited for half an hour outside Notre Dame only to realize it would not open at the time it was supposed to be open, and might not open for the rest of the day. Sainte-Chapelle had a similar strike. So when we came back the next day, both probably had more people in line than normal. With that aggravation, this church had to be pretty special for me to really root for it, and honestly it wasn't."

St. Chapelle is definitely something that needs to be on your visit to Paris if you're staying for a week or longer (if you're only there for a few days it's alright to skip). The line to get in is very long, but for a few euros more you can get tickets at the concierergie (the prison where Marie-Antoinette was housed) for both attractions, and then just go right into the chapel after seeing the prison! Anyone who is a stained-glass fanatic (as well as anyone who isn't) will marvel at the almost floor-to-cieling stained glass panels. Also worth the money if you're there for a while is to see a concert there. We heard Vivaldi's Four Seasons there in the evening and it was absolutely magnificent.

The upper chapel has one of the largest collections of 13th century stained glass in the world\u2026it is truly breathtaking! The soaring vaulted ceiling seems to float above magnificent stained-glass windows. Check-out the sculpted statues of the 12 apostles which lean on the columns. The lower chapel, dedicated to the virgin Mary, sports low vaulted ceilings. The walls are decorated with trefoiled arcades with 12 medallions which represent the 12 apostles. TIP: As Sainte Chapelle is so close to Notre Dame Cathedral and La Conciergerie, you may want to see both Notre Dame & Sainte Chapelle on your same trip. Queues seemed longest on the weekends. If possible, go on a week day near opening time and you should experience no wait.Location:4, boulevard du PalaisFee: 8.50 eurosOpen daily from 9:30 am to 6 pmMetro: Cite station (line 4).

Be prepared to stand in line to get in - or get in a much shorter line with the Paris Museum Pass. The incredible stained glass windows are the star attraction of this small chapel. We spent about 30 minutes here and that was more than enough time to take everything in. The only downside was the construction/restoration work that is ongoing. At the end of May, there was a big white covering on one side of the interior that makes it hard to take good pictures of full interior. There is also scaffolding on the outside that makes it hard to get good pictures of the beautiful steeple. It's still definitely worth a short visit though!"

Construction was ordered by Louis IX and was under the direction of a single architect hence there is a uniformity of design not seen in the majority of cathedrals. It was built to house the alleged crown of thorns from the crucifixion of Christ that allegedly cost Louis IX more than the cost of the chapel! The big draw is the fantastic stained glass windows that are being restored with the work 75% complete. We visited early in the day and had less than 30 min wait."

Located in the heart of Paris on Ile de la Cite, Sainte-Chapelle is part of the La Conciergerie complex. We arrived and were met with the longest (and slowest line we encountered during our trip). The security is some of the most thorough you'll have to go through in Paris and that's the main reason the line moves so incredibly slow. But it's worth it.Once through security a very short unmarked walk takes you to the entrance. It's hard to really admire the exterior of Sainte-Chapelle but the inside is where the real attraction is. Once through the entrance you come to a sounvenir stand and a pretty first room. But a narrow spiral staircase in the corner of the room takes you to chapel's real treasure, the stained glass. We were amazed at the incredible glass that dates back to the 13th century. Each huge window is dedicated to a book of the Bible and tells different stories from those books. It's truly breathtaking.There were some renovations going on upstairs so we didn't get the full effect but our experience was unforgettable. We visited a lot of churches in Paris and Sainte-Chapelle was one of the best. Make sure you make time to see it!"

The lines weren't super long, about a 20-minute wait to enter. We opted for the audio tour so that we could get the story on all of the stained glass panels, and we are glad we did.The left-hand side inside the chapel had restoration work being done on the stained glass, so mostly the right-hand side was available to view. It was rather crowded, but it is possible to see each panel and hear about it if you have patience (and can ignore pushy tourists).Overall, I would recommend this because it is a different church experience than Notre Dame. This was the chapel of the kings, and was the site of the relic of the \"crown of thorns\", brought back to France from one of the crusades. For those who are religious in nature, it is a wonderful site to view the biblical stories in stained glass.Tips:Best to go early, around opening when it is not so crowded.Best to go in the middle of the week.You must go through a metal detector since it is next to the courts buildingTake the audio tour so you can understand what you are seeing, and take the time to hear about each panel.Do not go on a dark, cloudy, or rainy day - you won't get the marvelous view of the stained glass.Overall, I'd go again; especially to view the panels that were under renovation. I would recommend this to family and friends."

At any rate, it is the amazing stained glass, with its intense blues, that draws people to the chapel. Lines can be long in the morning, but by mid afternoon, it doesn't take too long to get inside. The chapel is still consecrated, so it's not a place for loud voices or flash photography. But, on a sunny day, the light is sufficient for regular photography and it is a photographer's dream. The color scheme of the pillars and walls is also extraordinary. It is one of the three most extraordinary chapels of early Gothic that still survive (St. Martin du Champs and St. Germain de Pres are, I believe, the other two). It's worth it to buy the extra admission to see the Conciergerie as well, where Marie Antoinette awaited her execution."

On the ground floor the sales area obscured some of the architecture. It cost 8.50 euros to enter, and no doubt this goes towards upkeep and repairs, but if you have to choose, go to Notre Dame instead and make a donation!"

It was built in only six years, truly amazing when you see it and consider that construction took place in the 14th century. The stained glass windows are truly marvelous.Suggest you arrive early or just before reopening after the lunch break. The museum pass doesn't work for the main entry and passage through security (make sure you use the Sainte-Chapelle line and not the adjacent line for the Ministry of Justice). But it works for entry into the church itself. Take a look around the downstairs chapel for the palace staff, then head upstairs and prepare to be amazed. Don't miss it."

There was a long line with signage for the church and then another line for the justice department.

I had read about Sainte-Chapelle and how it was built to house the Crown of Thorns (and other relics from the Passion), so was looking forward to seeing the Crown of Thorns on my visit. I guess I didn't read close enough as these items are no longer housed at Sainte-Chapelle, but have been transferred to the Notre Dame Cathederal Treasury where the Crown of Thorns is displayed the first Friday of every month and on Good Friday during a service, \"Veneration of the Crown of Thorns\" - so if you are looking for the Crown of Thorns (as I and a few other visitors were), you won't find it here. What you will find however, are beautiful stained glass windows, that are worth the visit.Also, regarding the security line and other comments that I've seen posted: we did not have the museum pass and waited in the lengthy security line. While there was not separate signage posted, those people who had the museum pass were given priority over those without (i.e. if they came to the front of the line and asked, they were allowed immediate entry through security - we saw many people with museum passes do this while we were waiting to go through security)."

Now, I can appreciate the beauty of this place, but, when you first go in you kind of think \"is this it\", then you realise that to the left of the entrance is the staircase up to the next floor. When you get to the top of the stairs, you do get a \"wow\" factor. The stained glass is amazing, but there's only so long you can look at the same windows... the guides say to allow 1hr for your visit inside...i'd say more like 30 mins.

If you are a first-time visitor, don't let that put you off - its still worth going as is.And a tip for getting in. The queue on the street is just for security. Once you are inside, there is typically a long queue to buy tickets. For \u20ac2 more than the price of the admission to Ste-Chappelle alone, you can buy a combined ticket to Ste-Chappelle & the Conciergerie (buy them 50m down the road at the Conciergerie ticket office - usually no queue). With the combined ticket, you can completely skip the queue to get into Ste-Chappelle. It's worth at least \u20ac2 to save up to an hour of queuing time, especially in the rain or blazing sun."

Sainte-Chapelle (literally, Holy Chapel) is architecturally spectacular and unique amongst the many European churches and cathedrals open to the public. It is small, tall, and absolutely gorgeous! We've toured many cathedrals, churches, and tiny mountaintop chapels and this is just special.Sainte-Chapel has good if slightly echo-ey acoustics, and features string ensembles performing classical music many if not all evenings. Built by Louis IX in the mid-13th century and originally surrounded by his dynasty's Capetian royal palace, a down side to a visit here is that the palace is gone and the Chapel is now surrounded by, and must be entered through, the Justice Ministry -- so you wait in a line, sometimes in Parisian rain, and pass thru a gendarme-manned security checkpoint to enter.The other downside is access to the one-at-a-time, not-very-private toilet outside the Chapel and in the Justice building -- for which you have to wait in a line in an unsheltered courtyard. Not fun in the rain.BUT Sainte-Chapelle is worth it! Just gorgeous, good music, and very close to Notre-Dame, transit, cafes, and walkable to most central hotels.Located near the metro station \"Cit\u00e9\" on the Ile de la Cit\u00e9 in the middle of the River Seine, in the heart of Paris."

The chapel is within the Palais de Justice complex so there are queues to go through security and no separate entry for Paris Museum Pass Holders.

Tour the Conciergerie first (where Marie Antoinette was held before being taken off to lose her head), then take your ticket for Sainte-Chapelle and go in the much shorter line on the left reserved for people who have tickets and passes.

The line was quite long and I think we waited somewhere between 20-30 minutes to get in.There was another line to get into the Palais de Justice and it was considerably shorter. There is a security check-point before getting into the property which causes the line outside. A couple of Japanese tourists used the shorter line and snuck into the line for Sainte-Chapelle at the security check. It really annoys me that people are so sneaky, but I didn't want to cause a scene so I let it be.Inside in the courtyard you can buy tickets. I think it was 8 euros per person, and it's free if you're between the ages of 18 and 25 (and from Europe). An elderly French couple spent ages before us, paying with check and it seemed like they tried to get a lot of information on the site from the woman sitting at the ticket booth. She should've told them to speak to someone else as a long line was forming.The sight; you arrive at the entrance of the lower chapel. It truly is a wonderful sight, but the real magic is on the upper level. It was breathtaking. Unfortunately parts of the chapel were covered due to maintanence, but it should be finished by 2013. Other chapels will not impress me much after seeing Sainte-Chapelle! It was a long wait to see the two floors, but I'm glad I did it - even though I probably won't do it again.If you have pre-bought tickets you should not have to stand in line (I saw a lot of people with pre-bought tickets waiting in the same line with us until a guard informed them that they could cut the line, good to know!)"

We almost didn't see the small staircase leading up to the main church - at first we thought \"is this it?\" But having seen pictures, I knew it wasn't and spotted the small sign leading to the staircase.

You have to stand in the same line as everyone else. The whole experience was not worth the wait. The chapel is small, true that it has some amazing stained glass work but it is similar to work that we have seen in chapels all around the world. Go on a sunny day otherwise just skip it. do other important sightseeing sites of Paris first. Go here last if time permits. we were very enthusiastic before we went there but it was a bit of disappointment. So it is your call. If chapels are a must do on your itinerary than go for it otherwise enjoy many other charms that Paris has to offer."

It seemed small and was rather dark. Once we had looked around on this level, we then climbed up to the upper chapel. This chapel was the reason I had included this church on our must visit list given DH's interest in stained glass but even I wasn't prepared for the sheer size of the windows in this chapel. I got a crick in my neck looking up to the top and these windows were full length nearly to the floor. They were massive and the colors and scenes depicted so amazing. It was an Oh Wow! moment.

We went late one afternoon, hoping to avoid crowds. wrong! The person monitoring the line told us to come back first thing in the morning because there is no line. Wrong again! We still had to wait an hour. Part of the backup were two tour groups which got to go to the head of the line. Going through security is laborious. I would still recommend getting there first thing in the morning. By 10:30 the cathedral was packed. I later read in Rick Steve's guide to Paris that Easter Monday is a national holiday. Many French people take off the week on either side of that weekend. This was my 5th time to Paris, and I had never seen lines like we encountered at the monuments and museum!"

These windows are literally walls of dazzling color, most created centuries ago in an era of deep faith and belief in Divine Right of kings. The bad news: Originally, this place had to be funded by declaring yet another Crusade. It still needs funds. Not an active church anymore, there is a hefty entrance fee (as opposed to the other, free churches in Paris), long lines and a Sistine-Chapel crowding in the space itself. Forget any aesthetic contemplation - people are jostling about and are quite noisy. Also, there are concerts held regularly there, mostly Vivaldi's Four Seasons (which has nothing to do with the place). Don't go. These are simply tourist-trap concerts, played by rote. And the space was not built for Vivaldi, so any of his music gets lost and muddied. Check out St. Suplice instead; you can listen to a free mini recital on the best organ in Paris at 11:30 AM most Sundays, in between Masses."

We picked a performance including Vivaldi's Four Seasons. Bought tickets across the street at the Tabac store, the cheap seats, on the afternoon of the performance. Seeing the crowds waiting in line to get in that afternoon had me concerned about access to the chapel in the evening, but it was misplaced concern. If you have researched this particular concert, you will know that there is an online web site that will also sell you tickets, but only for the first 2 front sections. We were fine with where we sat. For an April evening, there was no problem getting tickets on the day of the performance. For the 7:00pm performance you are told to be there at 6:15pm, and at 6:10pm there was only a short line waiting to get in entrance #4. This allowed us to be in the first row of the last section, and since the last 2 rows of the section in front of us were not filled, there was a little breathing space. YMMV. The acoustics of the cathedral were excellent, and the performance exceptional. It was a great evening."

The stained glass is really amazing. When the glass comes in through the windows, it createa very cool atmosphere. However, a few things made this visit less memorable and (almost) not worth the time:- Line to get in. We got there at 9AM, opening time, and still had to wait 1 hour to get in through security. The Museum Pass doesn't help you get past the queue in this case. I guess this is normal for the famous landmarks in Paris, but it still wasn't fun. We did walk by later at different times and saw both shorter and much longer lines than the one we experienced, so it seems to be sort of hit-or-miss. Recommend moving on to something else in the area if the line is outrageous as you probably will find it shorter at another time (at least in April).- Construction. The church is under construction through most of this year. It doesn't diminish how impress it is but it made it harder to enjoy. We couldn't see an entire side of the church and the noise was very distracting in what should be a very quiet environment.Overall, it is something interesting to see but not as inspiring as some of the other sights in Paris."

I would come back to see it again, even if it's a relatively small place and I surely saw all of it when I went -- just to be surrounded by those gorgeous windows. Anyway, here are some tips!1. It's a block or so away from Notre Dame, and between the Palais de Justice and Conciergerie, so you can see all four sites at one time. Excellent! 2. Check opening and closing times. They also close from 1 PM to 215 PM, so consider this when you line up (there's a long line) after noon.3. Speaking of the long line, there are plenty of evil people who will cut line. Be aware! Remember who are the people in front of you and behind you.4. Security will check your bag thoroughly with metal detectors and stuff, probably because it is adjacent to Palais de Justice.5. Groups cannot just walk-in. Please check this requirement if it applies to you.6. It's small so if you don't dawdle, you could be in and out in 10 minutes (not counting the time you line up).7. They have a gift shop! Food and drinks are not available.8. Photography is allowed.Don't miss this!"

I'm not normally interested in classical music, but the performance was WONDERFUL. Beautiful music & voices. And the setting was amazing. It was still light at 7 pm so we could see all the colors of the stained glass windows. We then went back on Tuesday as part of a tour, so we got to see both the lower and upper chapels. There is some restoration still going on, but it is beautiful to see."

The stained glass is beautiful and in most months it is still dusk at 6:30 when you enter for the concert. It is classical music and they performed favorite baroque pieces such as Vivaldi's Four Seasons and Pachelbel's Canon. We purchased tickets online prior to our trip. We entered at #4 for the concert. It's just left of the gates of the Palace of Justice (golden gates). We also toured the Concegerie prior to the concert and had time for wine and cheese at Les Deux Palais across the street before the show. You do go through security prior to entrance. The music was beautiful in a gorgeous setting and I found it far more memorable than walking through for an hour. It is a miracle that so much stained glass has been preserved over so many hundreds of years. Some people don't realize that every color of glass is hand cut and leaded- read about it before attending a concert to appreciate its significance."

If you're planning a trip here I have three tips:Wait: There's currently restoration taking place to the entire church. We went on a very sunny March afternoon and all along the north side the light was blocked out by scaffolding. Obviosuly this can't be helped and is essential to the maintiaing the glass but if you can - visit it another time.Visit either early or late: The stained glass it at its best when the sun is either to the east or west. I would recommend a visit just after it opens or at about 6pm.There was a little confusion on the way in also - just to let you know that firstly you go through a security check point (as the chapel is located within the grounds of the ministry of justice). THEN you follow the signs to the church building (straigt ahead and turn right). At this point don't go straight to the booth by the door unless you bought your tickets before the visit. If you are buying your tickets on the day you need to go behind the booth to the ticket window where you purchase tickets first. Lots of people didnt relaise this and ended up queueing twice.Luckily I live in Paris and can't wait to return once the work is complete to see this stunning church in all it's glory. It's also worth taking a guide book or some notes with you to give you the details on the windows - I used 'Paris Top 10' which gives some really interesting details that you may otherwise miss."

After climbing the winding stairs, you will step out into a large space totally enclosed with the most beautiful stained glass windows.

Although shown on many maps, it's not immediately clear that it's actually INSIDE the Palais de Justice and you must go through a security checkpoint to reach the interior courtyard which surrounds the church.When entering the church, you first go into the Lower Chapel which is quite nice, but the Lower Chapel pales in comparison to the stunning beauty of the Upper Chapel. Recent restoration work on the windows and the interior has brought out striking details. We were simply awe-struck.Chairs are placed along the sides of the Upper Chapel for occasional music concerts.

Since many people couldn't read then they used these windows to tell bible stories to the parishoners. Quite beautiful when the sun was streaming in. Notice the floors, they are also pretty and beautifully colored. The only negative aspect of this church is finding it.

It is a room bathed in wonderful colors from many stained glasses. Each stained glass tells a dramatic story of the bible. The visit can be done in 30 minutes as there are only two floors with exhibits. The second floor is simply amazing and awe-inspiring. It is one of the structures that makes me wonder about the talent of craftsmanship from a long ago time. The dedication and artistic narrative represents human triumph and beauty.This is a great attraction to see with the Paris Museum Pass. The Pass covers the cost of entry, gets you to the front of the line, and allows you to visit at different times of lighting. It is also a good visit for when you are a little tired of walking. The stained glass floor contains ample seating, so you can sit and take in all the marvelous colors, stories and artwork."

There is a lower chapel, with a painted Annunciation. After climbing the narrow confined stairs in near darkness, you are greeted by a purely verticalized space, the Upper Chapel, filled with 15 tall glass windows done in the Rayonnant Gothic style, as you enter the upper chapel where the royals worshipped during pre-Revolution days. Here on the stained glass, there are more than 1,000 scenes of the Passion of Christ and Old and New Testaments. It's a startling effect and you're gawking for a few minutes. A really one-of-a-kind experience in this city full of unique experiences. Go on a weekday and pair the visit with one to the Conciergerie nearby and to Notre Dame."

The relics have since been moved to Notre Dame. There is an 8.50\u20ac entry fee, which i found unusual for a church. Because it is in the courtyard of the Justice Department you have to go through security clearance.  I would recommend this chapel if you have extra time.

We only had an hour to visit the church, but that was more than enough time to view the majestic stain glass windows on the second floor. Because it was the late afternoon, we got to see the sunlight filter through the western windows and play off the walls and ceilings. You may be tired of visiting churches after a trip to Notre Dame. However, I recommend this experience because it is completely different. Sainte-Chapelle is smaller, so the experience is more intimate. You are literally closer to the stain glass windows. Also, the windows are longer and take up most of the walls, which means that more light shines through.Lovely."

When you first walk into SC you may be surprised to find yourself in a dark low roofed arched chamber which comes to life through the extensive mediaeval wall paintings. This isn't what you've read about although it engenders a strong sense of its past. Then you see the stone staircases that do take you up to Sainte Chapelle itself. Several people I have taken to SC have found themselves without words when first confronted by the experience. It is visually stunning. The narrow stonework thrusts skyward toward the apex of the roof and in doing so creates sense of speed, lightness and movement. As they reach upward they are so slim you feel they are defying the gravity that must be pressing down on them , Between them these narrow stone arches also support the huge expanses of window that create the effect of glass walls or better still walls of light. The overall effect then is of light as an almost tangible substance that as it strikes the stonework and the people within, seems to give them an appearance of existing simply because of the light.There is also a crown of thorns that was purchased by King Louis IX (St.Louis) who built the SC. in 6 years starting in 1242. The crown of thorns was bought from Baudouin Emperor of Constantinople and cost 4 times s much as SC, Rip off if you ask me."

The stained glass is amazing, one of the best I have ever seen in the world, and the whole interior looks like it's a Faberge product. My advice: plan your visit for the low season, otherwise the queues are enormous. I was there on a November weekend, there were only five people at the ticket office, and about two dozen inside the chapel."

Definitley a little gem and worth a visit."

Notre Dame may have the name, Sacre-Coeur may have the views, but the Sainte-Chapelle is a stationary fiest for the eyes. The pictures of this can be found on the Internet, but like most sites, in order to be truly appreciated it has to be seen in person. I am surprised more people and travel guides don\u2019t have this rated higher. It is not an all day visit or even one you can linger around like the Louvre or Eiffel Tower, but it is still something that will leave a lasting impression on you. I would also recommend a magnet or even a stained glass ornament to take home for the memories."

Unfortunately, access to the upper level is via a very narrow spiral staircase so this, like many Paris attractions, may not be accessible for some. From the outside, it doesn\u2019t really look beautiful, more functional. The windows just look leaded; but inside, with the light shining, they are beautiful! In the main sanctuary, there are 15 panels of stained glass with over 1,000 different scenes that cover the entire Christian history. Some of the scenes are too high and too small to see, binoculars might be useful? The altar was built to display the Crown of Thorns (now at Notre Dame). If you like Sainte Chapelle, I\u2019d also suggest a trip to St. Denis to see the Bastille. "

The royals may have \"let them eat cake\" (or brioche), but they sure knew how to spend the wealth of their countrymen on fantastic treasures!"

And then, someone draw a curtain behing those tables to discover a small wing chapel which was used as a kitchen and storage space! That really was incredible! I couldn't believe that such a beautiful place was used like that. Besides, the floor was very dirty, I imagine as a result of the maintenance works going on."

When you go to Paris, check the internet for concerts as Sainte-Chapelle regularly hosts classical music performances. We saw a marvelous performance of Vivaldi's four seasons. It is an intimate yet soaring space. The music combined with the sacred beauty and history is simply too much to adequately describe. I cannot recommend enough.

You need to enter through the municipal offices, requiring security screening. You first visit a small chapel under Sainte-Chapelle, then you walk upstairs to the main chapel. It is truly stunning, the very high eiling seems to be held up by walls made entirely of stained glass windows, the supporting stone columns are thin and are barely noticeable amid the splendor of the windows.

It is now surrounded by the Justice Ministry and thus entry requires security checks (no sharp objects). Go early as the lines form up out on the road. Admission by the Paris Museum pass is included and allows one to skip the ticket queue inside the compound, but everyone is in the same line for security. On entering the building, one comes into a rather dark room with some decorations and a gift shop. Then climbing a very steep circular staircase, you enter the upper chapel which is mind-blowingly beautiful, especially on a sunny day. Much of the walls of the structure are tall colored glass windows that illustrate biblical stories. The color and craft have to be seen to be believed. It is possible to \"read\" the windows--some cards in various languages provide the deails. Access is controlled--so one could, in high tourist seasons--have to wait on line for maybe two hours if very late into the day. Again, the museum pass does give you a queue-cut in the inner courtyard by the ticket booth."

The Sainte-Chapelle is the only surviving building of the Capetian royal palace on the Ile de la Cite, and is now part of the Conciergerie complex. It was commissioned by King (now Saint) Louis IX to house his collection of the Passion Relics, including the Crown of Thorns. Its exterior is not as impressive or grand as the Notre Dame, but its interior is breathtaking in its beauty, especially the second floor. The walls are dominated by stained glass more beautiful than the Notre Dame\u2019s, and the remaining surface is richly decorated, even the floor! The ceiling of the lower chapel looked like the inside of a jewelry box. The Sainte-Chapelle is open from 930AM to 6PM from March to October, and 9 AM to 5 PM from November to February. The usual entrance fee is \u20ac8, and the usual combination ticket price for Sainte-Chapelle and the Conciergerie is \u20ac1. Note however that if you have the Paris Museum Pass, you can enter for free and do not have to wait in line to get in."

In fact, the majority of the walls are made of stained glass which makes the entire church just breathtaking. You can make the tour as long or as short as you'd like. We did audio tours when we went; however, the teenagers stopped paying attention after 10 minutes. It does provide interesting history. I would suggest only paying for an audio guide if you are a history fanatic, otherwise information provided at the info desk and in travel books will be sufficient. I would highly recommend visiting Sainte Chapelle!"

And at the end of the hall is a vision of end-of-days.I did not understand the translation of the symbols, but the vast expense and excellent workmanship, both examples of France's considerable excesses, are not to be missed.

I personally liked Notre Dame way more and I thought it was much cooler, we spent over an hour walking around the inside of Notre Dame and about 5 minutes inside Sainte-Chappelle. What made it worse was that it closes during lunch and we actually waited about a half hour before we got in. The windows are beautiful, and they actually have some brochures that explain what each window depicts. I am very into history and architecture but I found myself bored here, it's basically just one big room with a lot of stained glass. Maybe if you are very religious you'd appreciate it more than I did. Again if you want to stop by quickly and see it go ahead it is neat for a few minutes (especially if your using the Paris pass and your visit is free), but I'd rather spend my time visiting the Louvre, Musee d'Orsay, Invalides, Versailles etc. Overall this was my least favorite place we visited while in Paris, though my dad liked it a lot.

Now there are lines, there is a gift shop on the first floor, but when you walk up those circular stairs in the corner of the room andthen see the fabulous main chapel it takes your breath away. It is like a wonderful jewel with huge stained glassd windows on three sides and the ceiling is navy blue with gold fleurs-de-lys. It is truly an exceptional vision."

It consists of the most beautiful stained glass collection in all Europe. It is unbelievable when you consider the time where it was built.There is a waiting line since you have to undergo a security screening (like the aiport) since this building is situated in the interior court of the courthouse.Since this attraction is related also to the Concergerie (2 doors down) you can buy your tickets at the Concergerie for both attractions and cut the line at the Sainte Chapelle. Really smart thing to do!ENJOY!"

We got in line for 15 minutes and had the line cut off not too far behind us.Once we went thru the metal detectors there was another short line to buy tix outside the chapel. First you go into the lower chapel, which is interesting in its own way. But then, up a very narrow winding stairway, the upper chapel will just take your breath away. We spent 30 minutes inside looking at all the bible stories on the windows, and since the line had been cut off behind us, gradually the crowd inside the chapel began to get smaller. Soon we were just about alone in this beautiful place. We were in and out of there in just about 1 hour. I can see where the visits could take much longer if you were not as lucky with your timing... but look online for the site to buy tix in advance."

Purchase tickets next door before you line up to enter, and go early as it is very popular. We avoided long queues by reading the signs and buying the tickets at the separate ticket office before going to the church entrance. The Conciergerie (next door to the church) is also well worth a visit and you can buy tickets to see both at the same time.

I chose Vivaldi's Four Seasons concert, as I am familiar with it. Arrived a little early, as it was open seating. Sat mid-way in the back, to take in the ambiance and look at the stained glass. As soon as the music started, my mother started crying - it was so beautiful, the acoustics were so good, it was that emotional for her. The program lasted an hour and we left very inspired."

There are good signs on the outside of the building. Lines are usually long due to the fact that everyone must pass through the metal detectors, just like in the airport, although you can keep your shoes on. So don't bring any sharp objects. Also no smoking, eating, drinking, or gum chewing in the church. Cost about 8 Euros.You first enter the lower church which is relatively unexciting and shopworn, but then you climb the tricky and steep circular stone medieval staircase to the second level and it will blow your mind. The 15 stained glass windows contain over 1000 scenes from the Bible starting from the bottom left and continuing all the way around. Every one of the windows has different designs in the stonework and leadwork supporting the glass. There are large handouts telling you what each window displays. When the sun is shining, the view is spectacular. But don't go on a cloudy or rainy day as you will lose the effect.Because the courts are built so close around it, the exterior is not as easy to view or photograph without a very wide angle lens."

We then walked past a line that extended at least two blocks to the Sainte-Chapelle entrance, receiving immediate access! Saved at least one hour in line and what a fabulous visit.

My francophone wife asked one of the guards how much longer our wait would be and he, almost immediately, let a bunch of us through.We walkwed onto the Palais de Justice grounds and saw the church from the outside. When inside we marvelled at the colourful stained glass windows and painted ceiling and decorated pillars. When we were ready to leave both of us wondered about what happened to the very tall windows we had glimpsed when walking by the church. Luckily we spotted small staircases on either side of the entrance with people going up and down on them. So we went up. I was walking behind my wife and when she reached the top of the stairs she stopped as though stunned. she had her hand over her mouth and just stood there awed by the brigh and colourful scene in the upper part of the church. Because we happened to be there toward the end of a sunny day, the rays of the setting sun amplified the brilliance of the colours of the windows and decorations on the inside of the church. An amazing sight! A single row of charis on both sides of the main space allowed us to sit and contemplete the beauty of the windows and ceiling. Don't miss this spectacular site!"

So the first thing you will see is a security line where you have to strip off all your metal and put them on the tray to be examined through an x-ray machine and then walk through a metal detector. When you get past this checkpoint you walk in and over to the line for the tickets (unless you were smart enough to have bought the museum pass, whereupon you can just walk right in!)The downstairs includes a store and you look and you are wondering... what the heck am I doing here, nothing special... and then you notice an unassuming staircase in the corner and you walk up and then you realize what everyone is talking about and why everyone is here.... it's wall to wall stained glass. The first five panels are the most difficult to see and are soon to undergo restoration, but they are magnificent and well worth the wait."

There is a moderate crowd in the church which bothered some in our group (it is not unlike the crowd within the Sistine Chapel in Rome). We were lucky enough to see it on a very sunny day and I suspect it would not be so impressive on an overcast day.BUT the line outside lasted more than two hours on a weekday morning. Since it is in the main court building there is a airport like security check which seems to cause the delay.Despite the fact that it is stunningly beautiful, I would not recommend it to anybody who is does not have a particular longing to see it as it will eat up half a day, 80% of which is spent standing on a sidewalk (with a rather dull view too)."

It was 4 violinists and one cello player in the chapel. We booked over the phone and got there early as the seating was first come first serve, except some VIP's in the front row. We were in the third row, smack in the middle. We asked one of the men directing us where to go for an elevator, and we were escorted right away, although a bit of a walk. There are a lot of steps otherwise. I forgot my camera but many took pictures of the rose window and chapel before the concert. The concert itself was absolutely SPECTACULAR. It was fascinating being so close to the performers and watching their faces as they played. The program included Vivaldi's Four Seasons, Canon in D, and a soprano who sang both versions of the Ave Maria. I will never forget it. These concerts are open to the public and are offered several times a week, I think. Unfortunately I forget the exact price, but I think perhaps 30 Euros. Well worth it! The head violinist even did a duet with the cellist that was not even on the program..I have never heard anything like the sounds coming from his violin. The setting is also a dream; a must see, in my opinion."

There are chairs positioned so that visitors can sit down everywhere and have a good view of the windows which towers above you. Both levels of this building are fabulous and absolutely worth a visit when you are in Paris. Do a bit of homework before you go, in order to appreciate the interesting history and all the art , including the beautiful statues, paintings and sculpture of this relatively small cathedral that comes with a punch you won't easily forget!

Cost is E11 compared to E8 for Ste- Chapelle and E7 for Conciergerie. Visit Conciergerie first - it will take less than an hour and then go to St- Chapelle. You do not have to line up. Go straight to the front and go through the security check. Once inside, there is another long line up to actually buy tickets. Again, just walk past this line and walk to the front.

What it lacks in size and structure it makes up for in beauty. It is virtually impossible to stand in the center of the church and not find your jaw drop just before you say, \"Wow, this is amazing.\" It's easy to miss from the outside and took longer to enter than many other churches, but it's worth the effort to find."

I visited Sainte-Chapelle twice on a recent trip to Paris; first as a tourist, checking it out during the day, and second as a concert attendee in the evening. Both were fantastic! Visit the church on a sunny day to REALLY get the most out of the amazing stained glass windows. I still cannot believe how magical it felt.... Also, if you're into classical music in a very unique setting, by day-of tickets (you can't buy them any more ahead of time than that) to see a concert. We attended a 5-piece string concert that played Pachabel and Four Seasons, and in such a setting, it was incredible. I'm not a church kind of girl, but this one is now in my top 2 of all time (along with the famous one in Reykjavik, Iceland). Worth the wait in line!!"

It represents some of the finest achievements in high Gothic architecture and stained glass fabrication. It is a small chapel built for the royal family to house Christian relics. I was not disappointed. Because it is a small structure, it is much easier to take in and appreciate the detail, workmanship and beauty of the place than many of the larger churches. The line to get in can be long (we waited 50 minutes), but the beauty, warmth and intimacy of the space is well worth the wait. I recommend Sainte Chapelle even ahead of Notre Dame, Sacre Couer, etc."

The upstairs is also wonderful because the entire walls are stained glass and its more interesting if you know the stories being depicted in each vertical panel. Definitely go.

The line could be as long as 45minutes long especially since school groups always managed to get preferential treatment in queues. In spite of the line, seeing the windows itself is a wonderful reward and no matter how many pictures you may have seen in books etc, it will surprise you even more in person (unlike a little painting housed in the Louvre).Highly recommended."

Saint Chapelle is one of a kind I'd say.. a wonderful Gothic church with exquisite stained glasses, through which the passing light creates heaven-like iridescences, uncovering the well-known Biblical stories.. The best moment for visiting is late afternoon, when the sun is going down.. Then the stained glass above the main door is breathtaking.. Also, I noticed that, no matter how many people are inside at one given time, if you take a sit for a while, you have the feeling that you are there alone, but not feeling lonely.. You feel surrounded by a profound immemorial love..As for practical aspects, the best time to go is early in the morning or during lunch time.. The lines are always huge, but those moments seem to be less crowded.. Be aware that groups have priority :D (as everywhere else in paris or versailles), and that having a paris pass won't help you skip the lines (again, as everywhere else in paris or versailles, except for Arc de Triomphe - if you ask - in French :) - why they don't comply with that as promised when you've bought the pass, they usually become rude)Also be aware that you are not supposed to carry anything sharp in your bags.

            "review": "A beautiful little jewel. This is always one of my highlights of Paris. I think this is my third visit to Sainte Chapelle but I love it so much. There are a couple of things to point out, if you have not been before. There is very tight security to get in here because it is within the grounds of the court of justice. Therefore, you firstly have to go through an airport-like security screening process. Pick your time because the line/queue to get through this process can be horrendous at certain times of the day. The earlier you go, the better chance you have of missing the big crowds. Once inside, if you do not have a museum pass (which is invaluable in Paris), you will then have to queue up for tickets, which I think are around 12 Euros. If you do have the museum pass, you can walk straight through (once you have cleared the security area). However, this beautiful little jewel is worth it. The Kings Chapel, in the upper part of the church is not to be missed. You must climb a narrow stair case to get up there, but once you are up inside, you can grab a seat and just sit and wonder at the beauty for ages. Virtually all of the upper level walls are stained glass. It is particularly stunning in late afternoon, when the sun in shining through the stained glass windows. It is only a tiny church but stunning (in the upper chapel). Once you are up here, it is up to you how long you sit or stand and admire it. It is tiny, so you can see if very quickly. The longest part is getting through the security (and ticket) queues."

The French kings had their palace here before they moved to the Louvre. Now they have law courts in the buildings. King Louie IX was the king who built the royal chapel. He is known as St. Louie because the Church canonized him. He built the chapel around 1238 to house the relics he had bought from the Frank king of Constantinople. These relics are the crown of thorns that Jesus wore and part of the true cross. He bought these relics for a large fortune.The lower chapel were for the people who worked for the king. This has a low ceiling and is not very impressive. The windows have a lot of stained glass. Then you ascend to the second floor by a very narrow and claustrophobic stone staircase. On the second floor is the royal chapel, only for the king. The beauty and amount of stained glass from the middle ages is very impressive. The building is very light and the colors from the stained glass windows are overpowering. The ceiling is very high here. At the end of the room is a rose window, also of stained glass. The glass has more than a thousand panels that you read from left to right and from down to up. They are scenes from the Bible, from the Book of Exodus to the Book of Apocalypse. This is truly a remarkable place to visit.During the French Revolution, the chapels were damaged. It was during the 19th century that they restored the chapels."

After reading what this Guide, which only costs \u00a36.95, says, we decided we must definitely see it. I am so glad we did as it proved to be the highlight of our trip. I could have sat looking at the wonderful stained glass for hours \u2013 until you are surrounded by it as here you do not realize the full impact of it. For the record, in case it proves helpful to anyone else who does not want to get overtired, I would like to recommend the boat trips on the Seine by night (we went twice, once on Bastille night when we saw the spectacular firework display, and once the following night, as my son was disappointed that because of the fireworks the boat didn\u2019t go as far as the Eiffel Tower, and he was looking forward to seeing it at close quarters when lit up). I could also recommend the Open Top Bus Tours of the city \u2013 though don\u2019t leave it too late, as the driver will stop as soon as the finishing time comes, and you will have to make your own way back on the metro! Since I am both a history nut and a Catholic we also visited the great Churches, Notre Dame, St Sulpice and Sacre Coeur Basilica, and Sainte Germaine des Pres, the oldest Church in Paris, though we did have to give the Church of St. Denis a miss, which was a pity, as it is the burial place of the Kings of France. Our favourite was Notre Dame, in which we also attended Mass on the Saturday evening and was very impressed by the precision and magnificence of the Mass and how well trained the young servers were. We unfortunately chose the hottest day of our visit to see Pere La Chaise, and had to climb uphill to see the graves of Chopin and Sarah Bernhardt and Oscar Wilde. I was very sad to see how this latter tomb has been defaced with numerous inscriptions, some in very dubious taste. However, I would not have missed this visit for the world. We also had to give Versailles a miss to my disappointment. We consoled ourselves with the Luxembourg Gardens, as it was very near to our hotel and spent quite a lot of time there. I hope we shall be able to see St. Denis and Versailles on another occasion. I think, after Sainte Chapelle and Notre Dame, possibly what I liked most of all (though I loved every moment I was there) was just sitting with a cup of cappuccino outside one of our favourite bistros and just soaking up the atmosphere. I am now absolutely in love with Paris."

I turned around as everyone was entering the main chapel to \"Wow\" \"Whoa\" \"Wow\" and another \"Wow.\" Nothing I said could even prepare my family for this amazing place. As you're here, take some time to look at the story being told in each stained glass panel. It's truly an amazing work of art. The colors are so vibrant, which has a powerful impact on you, even for someone who isn't religious, like myself. Like many of the places in Paris you're transported back to a different time, amazed at how something so grand could be constructed (and in just six years for Sainte Chapelle) without the technology that we have today. Don't forget to look down at the floor, as that has a lot of detail as well. You only need about an hour to view this amazing place, and I would highly recommend it. Go on a day that's sunny and you won't be disappointed."

Well, it was beautiful! The first chapel you enter is not that spectacular....especially after you have just left Notre Dame. However, once you begin climbing the circular stairway you suspect there is much more to see...and there is. The upper chapel is splendid. There is much more stained glass than stonework. The windows tell the stories from the Bible, beginning with Genesis and covering many of the remaining books. There are explanations for the windows available in many languages. There are chairs lining the room to allow those out of breath after the climb to sit and rest, or to just stare in awe at the way sunlight is dispersed by the glass.I am told there is usually a wait to get in, and we did wait for around 30 minutes. The fee is 8 Euros too. However, the wait and the cost are certainly worth see the splender of the upper chapel."

We decided to go to the concert and this was one of the greatest moments in our Paris visit. The quite small chapel has very impressive stained glass windows that enter beautiful light into the building - great atmosphere. We also very enjoyed the music that was played there. Please note that you have to be there early because the chapel is within the area of Palais de Justice and you have to pass the security examination that may take time."

So this meant that we had to collect our ticket at a FNAC outlet.Our concert was at 7pm but we got there a little earlier in anticipation of having to go through the metal detectors and the possibility of queues (that seemed to be a recurring theme around anything touristic in Paris). But we were pleasantly surprised to find that there were no queues at all. We struggled a little to find the entrance and had to ask around before we were told the entrance was via the Palais de Justice.The interior of Sainte Chapelle was beautiful. The stained glass was all aglow with the yellow light of the evening sun. It really looked like a slice of heaven.Our program for the night was Antonio Vivaldi\u2019s Concerto for 2 Trumpets and Orchestra and \u2018The Four Seasons\u2019, performed by Les Violons de France and soloist Frederic Moreau. The entire concert was about 90 minutes. The performance was world-class. Even though hubby is a classical music neophyte, he enjoyed the entire performance, made even more glorious by the beautiful surroundings. After the concert, there was an opportunity to meet the virtuoso Frederic Moreau himself. After congratulating him on a fine performance, we purchased one of his CDs and got him to autograph it.We both thought it was a wonderful experience. The concert really added to our experience of Sainte Chapelle."

The first floor is gorgeous as well, just no stained glass. A gorgeous spot for quiet contemplation. I've been there twice and can't wait to see it again!

If you are visiting this summer, look for concerts held in the evenings. We discovered this while waiting on line to go in, There was an A-frame sign advertising the concert that evening - a concert of various Ave Marias, including Caccini's. Tix were 20euro and could be purchased at the little souvenir shop across the street. If you are a music lover, I highly recommend it. Instead of paying 11 euro to enter just to see the chapel, pay 9euro more and hear beautiful music played in one of the most beautiful chapels in the world. Concerts seemed to be held frequently both there and at Notre Dame. Definitely worth it."

So I had plenty of time to read all the signage on display, about opening hours at carols seasons, entry prices, the restoration of several of the famed stained glass windows. Absolutely nothing about having to pass through a security scanner like a terrorist about to board an aeroplane.Not that scanners are uncommon at major tourist sites - I and my small penknife had passed and granted to The Louvre and the Musee d'Orsay in the preceding couple of days.So I was a bit astonished and nonplussed when the gendarmerie refused me entry to Sainte Chapelle unless I tossed away my pocket knife (a necessary item in France, for slicing fromage and removing corks from wine bottles- the stelvin closure has not made much impact on the French wine industry). He wouldn't 'mind' it for me and I wasn't about to go out and queue up again, as the queue was by this time out around the block. So I missed out.Of course the French have every right to apply what ever conditions they wish to visitors of their national treasures. I just wish they could have included this particular and critical condition on the sign up front, so I could have made appropriate arrangements and not wasted my morning. But I suppose when you count your annual visitors in the millions and they just keep coming, you don't have to bother much with notions of visitor experience and customer service."

            "review": "Parisian Paradise - la Sainte Chapelle's Wednesday Evening Hours. La Sainte Chapelle is one of the world's most spectacular cathedrals. The upper chamber's stained glass windows, radiating intensely with a pervasiveness of carmine reds and cobalt blues, punctuated with splashes of amethyst and jade, canary and white, draw huge crowds that line up all day long awaiting their chance to pass through metal detectors to enter and enjoy the play of light against the cathedral's spiritual glass walls.For years my wife and I have been visiting Paris and, on each trip there, we make it a point to visit la Sainte Chapelle as frequently as possible ... sometimes to join the daytime crowds, at others to attend one of the many choir or violin concerts that are periodically staged in the evenings there throughout the year.On our most recent trip, however, we discovered, and quite by accident, that there is another way to enjoy the Cathedral's wonders ... and that is on a Wednesday evening during the summer months, from May through September, when la Sainte Chapelle has extended hours and is open with special entry times from 6-9PM. Because Paris is situated in a northern latitude, the light, which is a prerequisite for appreciating the building's stained glass, remains bright well into the evening and bathes the cathedral's upper chamber with a brilliant, yet softly subdued, glow. The bonus that one receives from visiting la Sainte Chapelle during one of these extended-hours Wednesday evening openings is the utter lack of crowds that flood the cathedral during the day. On June 1, when we entered at 7:00PM, there were no more than a handful of visitors and we all had uninterrupted, un-jostled, un-flash punctuated opportunities to slowly examine, study up close, and reflect upon the biblical scenes and interplay of prismatic light that bathed the upper chamber in a tapestry of colors. As a matter of fact, there were more guards than tourists in the cathedral that evening.BOTTOM LINE: If you are in Paris on an in-season Wednesday evening, avoid the long lines and visit la Sainte Chapelle after 6:00PM. You will be rewarded with all of the beauty of the cathedral's stained glass, but without the intrusion of the crowds."

The line is staggering- but if you have a museum pass you can skip ahead of security (the first long line you must wait in) and again you can skip the ticket line (the other very long line). It closes at odd hours during the day, so make sure to check the times before you go. Also, there is often a long line outside, so make sure you are smart about the time you decide to go. We tried going on 3 different occasions- once the person at the line said our museum pass would not let us skip the line, the other time, it worked. So- I would suggest that you keep checking. Make sure you bring some sort of materials that will explain what the designs on the stain glass signify- it is much more interesting to know what you are looking at. I would also try to go at a time when there is a lot of light- it is staggering how beautiful it is! The chapel is very small, so you could spend a very quick visit, or you could spend a long time really looking at all of the designs. If you have time, I would also go next door to the Conciergerie and see where Marie Antoinette spent her time in prison. They have a mock prison cell and have decorated the area as it would have been in the past. Again, make sure you have a book or a tour or something to really give you context into what you are looking for. There is a restroom and there are a few stairs. I think Rick Steves has a GREAT audio tour that can explain everything in St. Chapelle and the Conciergerie."

But it is the upper chapel which will make you gasp and take your breath away. The magnificent stained glass windows are 360 degrees around you , and extend almost from floor to ceiling. There are 1,113 scenes illustrating the story of mankind from Genesis to Christ's resurrection, shown in 15 enormous windows. Prepare to wait in line outside for entrance. We waited about 1/2 hour, but it was well worth it. The windows are best seen on a sunny day."

The reviews here are absolutely right, as soon as you get to the 2nd floor of the chapel, one glimpse at the windows will *literally* take your breath away! This was one of the most beautiful attractions I have ever seen, and I have been to London, Rome, Amsterdam, Barcelona... Pictures definitely don't do this justice, trust me! If I could go back to one place in Paris right now, it would be the Sainte-Chapelle. Do NOT miss this when visiting Paris!"

The cost is 8 euros per person. Seeing the chapel where the royals worshiped requires that you walk up a narrow winding staircase, I did not see an elevator. We fortunately had some bright sunlight that day and the stained glass was brilliant, over 6,000 square feet of it."

A beautiful chapel with so much strong theology throughout. Excellent in every way. It's hard to believe this was built in 1245."

Just have in mind simple things visiting this place.Go there first thing in the morning, before visit other museum or attraction. Every single visitor is passing by access controls and scanned for metallic or forbidden objects. Put all your coins or metal objects in your bag. Be prepared as going to an airport with destination to US. No need to lose objects, or lose time in that.Museum pass card can be used in here.Sainte-Chapelle has an entrance level and the well known upper level. Before you go up from the staircase on the right of the entrance, finish anything you want to see on the ground level. If you see the upper level, you will not want to see anything else from the base level and perhaps miss some interesting vitraux in there.See the signs about which staircase to use. There are 2 that have room only for 1 person at the time, one for going up and the other as exit.You can use your camera, but not the flash.The number of vitaux is big to spend time taking photos, buy an album if you want but don't waste time photograph all you see. Something special yes, not anything.There are some very well written cards about Saint Chappele on the upper floor in 5-6 languages. Pick-up one in your most familiar language and read some interest things about what you see. There are some interesting things about this place. There are 15 chapters that have different thematic synthesis from the holy books to the story of how the objects were taken from the french king during the crusades. It is an interesting story and the reason why this chapel was built at first place. To gather the holy objects taken from Constantinople during the capture from the crusaders of the eastern roman empire's capital.After you finish your upper floor visit and exit Sainte-Chapelle have a look at the wonderful made gargoyle's and demons on the top of the building.WC are next to the exit on the other yard that you came in first place. Remember that you will exit from the other yard than the first you enter.This place is a nightmare for a disabled person to visit, as i can tell. Except the checks that propably will simply not let you in, the place itself is build in a way that no disabled person can access. Do not even try to go there at first place.A must see for crusades thematic travelers and medieval history lovers.As someone wrote, \"If you have time to visit one cathedral only, choose this one if you can\", i agree on that too."

It is on the same site as the Palais de Justice and access to the Sainte-Chapelle, which is a national historic monument, is controlled by the gendarmerie and it is strictly forbidden for visitors to be in possession of any metal objects such as knives, scissors and any other pointed or sharp metal instruments. This can prolong your waiting time - especially if like us you get behind someone who wants to take a spoon in with them (I kid you not). They will confiscate anything they find, and you don't get it back - so be warned if you want to take cutlery with you (!)But, once inside...stunning, breathtaking, stupendous - can\u2019t think of any more superlatives that are adequate. It is a really special place. The lower chapel (originally for servants and lower orders of the Royal Palace) is very beautiful, but the real surprise awaits you upstairs in the upper chapel \u2013 the visually striking stained glass windows, that soar up to the gothic, vaulted ceiling. The windows are in the process of being renovated at the moment, and from the parts that have been finished you can see just how stunning the chapel will be once the renovations are finished. Literally took my breath away \u2013 I didn\u2019t want to leave. I could have sat there all day just taking it all in.Will definitely go back in a few years once the renovation is complete."

From the outside it does not look as extravagant as Notre Dame, but the inside is breath-taking. When on the ground floor walk to the end of the church (past the gift shop area), look up and to the left... there is a painting of (I believe) Gabriel Angel and Mary.... this is the oldest wall painting in all of Paris.When you reach the 2nd level (french 1st) and see the windows, it is absolutley amazing. It is one thing to see pictures and postcards of it, but they're nothing like the real thing. There are restorations going on until 2011/12 but it is still worth the visit. Everything about this church is nothing short of astonishing.TIP: When in line... there is a line for the Palace de Justice as well one for Sainte-Chapelle... they both go to the same place so you can just stand in the shorter line. As well, there's a line for people with passes and one for people without passes, no one checks if you have a pass until you try to enter Sainte-Chapelle so you can stand in any line."

The hold up seemed to be the ticket window, which we never got to because after getting within 25 feet of the ticket window they allowed museum pass holders to enter through a separate line for advance reservation holders. Not sure why they can't just have signs that allow museum pass holders to use this line. This would shorten the line considerably.Once we got in, we were amazed by the beauty of the interior. They are redoing the front seven windows until 2013, which is a little disappointing but you can still get your fill of stained glass by looking at the rest of the church. After visiting so many huge churches in Paris, it was a nice change of pace to see this different design. There is so much stained glass in this church, you wonder how they were able to build the walls so high without it falling down. It is kind of amazing to think that for hundreds of years this was the King's private chapel and now you are able to stand in the same place as the Kings of France."

We had a pre-set reservation for our group, and were able to bypass the long line b/c of that. But, at the ticket window inside the courtyard, I had quite a problem with the worker. Our pre-printed reservation had one price, and I had a check from a French bank written for that amount. She disagreed with the pre-set tarif, reserved in advance. She made me pay more. Then she refused the check since the agent had written 60 in English and not French. She was rude and unhelpful. It put me in tears. The girl at the booth taking the tickets was most apologetic. I was shocked to be treated this poorly, especially at a church. BUT once we got inside, the magic of Ste Chapelle erased the bad attitude outside!!"

It was actually a great time to visit, because you can compare one wall of stained glass windows which hasn't been restored since it was installed in 1200, and a wall of stained glass that was painstakingly restored piece by piece. If you are looking for a grandiose cathedral like Notre Dame, you will be disappointed, like some reviewers on this site, and consider it a second class site. However, it you understand that this was the King's private chapel, built next door to his Palace, and he had it built in a mere five years, you will be amazed. The stained glass walls tell the story of the bible, beginning with Adam and Eve and going through the Old and New Testaments. Consider that some of the other churches in Paris are supported by huge columns. This chapel was a real advancement in building technique at the time. The columns are so thin that they almost disappear and the walls appear to be made of stained glass. It was a huge technical feat in 1248 and remains a masterpiece of Gothic architecture. If you can't appreciate this, and the craftsmanship in the stained glass, you will run in and out in five minutes and wonder what all the fuss was about. I would recommend visiting the Conciergerie next door and buying a combined ticket. You will need to go through a security check, because the chapel is located in the middle of the Paris Supreme court buildings. After seeing the chapel, you might want to take the time to walk up the stairs to see the Paris courts and the attorneys standing outside for a smoke in their black robes. We walked right in and peeked in at a tribunal that was in session. As for the cost, I was pleased to support the restoration of this important site."

The glass tells bible stories, I have read that it was the 'bible of the poor' in the Middle Ages - one did not have to know how to read to relate to the stories. We noticed that there was a violin concert happening that evening in the church (le 9 violins de France). We went and it was wonderful. We wanted to go all over again on the next performance! The fact that there was plastic, etc. hanging behind them did not matter - the contrast of the tuxedos against the plastic was rather interesting! I will have to dig out my photos and post a few.

The line was long when I arrived around 11am, but I later found out it's because everyone is slowly being led through a metal detector that must be run by the good folks at TSA. No way to skip this queue with the Museum Pass (or with the intention to purchase it as I did) and it actually moved pretty quick. If you're hungry, there's a couple places to grab food to go right across the street while in line.Once past the metal detector, you're led into a courtyard where the outside of the church becomes more visible. It's a fascinating structure from the outside and the numerous carvings in the arches are a sight. Just a little longer in the queue for a ticket (8 euros or 12,50 including a visit to the Concierge) and I was inside. It is a beautiful chapel with a statue of St. Louis where the altar would have been and some very nice stained glass that has survived remarkably well. There's a large gift shop right there as well. All in all, I was thinking \"this place is nice, but what's the big deal?\" Then I happened to see some folks going up a staircase which is pretty easy to miss in the corner of the room and followed them up a narrow spiral staircase (wondering if anyone misses this and actually leaves without seeing the top...I almost did). The worshipping area on the second floor is the most beautiful thing I have ever witnessed. St. Louis must have paid a pretty penny for Christ's crown of thorns (reportedly 3 times the cost to acquire of building the church which was meant to house it), because this place is awe inspiring. Stained class windows everywhere and if you're there on a sunny day as I was lucky enough to be, the whole room lights up in a pretty awesome way. Words cannot possible describe how one will feel when seeing this marvel. Do not miss this amazing site!"

The downstairs is very understated but feels like you are inside some kind of Moorish tent. The upper level with the stain class is stunning. Even on a dull day the whole room was awash with colour.Downside: it can take a long time to queue to get in because of the security measures. It doesn't actually take that long to go around the chapel so it might be worth waiting until nearer closing time when I guess the wait would be shorter."

This is one of the smallest, most challenging to enter, yet most memorable. Most old churches are gray and somber, with spots of gold leaf and some colorful stained glass. A few have visible remnants of faded interior paint. Entering the upstairs of Sainte-Chapelle is like walking into a kaleidescope the size of a basketball court. Rather than side walls, spaces between the columns are filled with vibrant stained glass windows. The remaining interior surfaces are covered with vibrant colors and patterns or gold leaf. This church helps you understand the exuberant religious message other churches had when their interiors were brightly painted showplaces, rather than the bare, dull stone interiors we see today. As others have said, plan for a wait on the sidewalk to pass through the metal detector/bag x-ray. I had a museum pass and had no wait at other Paris attractions, so this unexpected wait put me in a bad mood. But I forgot about it when I got inside."

While this was a beautiful chapel with all of the stories of the bible depicted in stained glass, I was sad to see that the stories that they were depicting were not being practiced in this building. It seemed as a picture of what is happeneing to the church overall in France. They had hired a man to keep silent reverence but for what?? There was no alter, no worship. Even a rude French woman sitting next to me gave our child who was not loud a \"shhht shhht\" I was quite offensive. This was the third time on our trip to Paris where the French were rude in my opinion. I had always thought the rude french generalization was just that and it would not be so. I found however esp in this building that it was. Honestly the government would do better handing this one over to the church. If you have a museum pass though it is worth the line if even for what this chapel once was. . .:("

Take time to read the detailed information available in the upper chapel and understand the complex lecture of the stained-glass windows. To avoid long lines come early in the morning (best light of the day for reading the windows). The entrance to the chapel is also that of the law courts of Paris, hence the long lines! Priority is always given to those who are called to attend court. The concert season of the Sainte-Chapelle runs from 14th March through 11th November, two concerts are programmed every evening at 7pm & 8.30pm. The concerts are not organised by the chapel administration, the chapel is rented to private orchestras. The chapel is not heated, due to conservation restrictions, so be warned that concerts in early spring and late autumn can be a chilly experience."

The line was long (but not terribly) and you do have to go through the metal detectors. My advice is get the ticket for both the Chapel and the Concergierge (Prison). The ticket is around 13 Euros for both. If you do not by them together, you end up spending almost 18 Euros and that is WAY too much. The Chapel is quaint but small and should be free for what you see. We also went on a partly cloudy day and while the glass is probably pretty vibrant on a sunny day, it was less than that when we went. I also suggest you skip it if pressed for time."

Yes there is quite a bit of stained glass, but let's face it, only a small portion will be backlit during any time of the day. The rest does not look like much. There are more than a few awkward moments at this site. The entrance requires you to go through metal detectors and there are many guards. Once you get through the guards, you enter a enclosed courtyard type area and it is not clear where to enter the chapel. Finally, once you get inside the church, you are inside a small gift shop area and it take a while to find the spiral staircase that lead to the main part of the attraction. Once you get there, you realize that it was probably not worth the effort.The inside of the site was under renovation and there was scaffolding blocking some of the glass. The place was very dusty. Don't know if that was due to the renovations, but it did not look nice.If you have plenty of time, go for it, if pressed for time, you can skip this one."

It also has lots stained glass and history. The line-up for the Sainte-Chapelle was quite long and it is not cheap. I would only suggest you visit if you have the Paris Museum pass since I doubt you will spend more than 30-60 minutes inside. Perhaps this has special significance to the religious, but to me it was a sub-par attraction."

Sainte-Chapelle is the jewel of Paris.....yes, everyone goes to Notre Dame, and it is the Catholic center of Paris, and etc, etc etc......but Sainte-Chapelle truly feels more personal. I am not of the Catholic faith, but the artistry is overwhelming....almost Byzantine compared to its Gothic equivalents.Yes, it is small, and basically one chamber (the altar was under reconstruction when we saw it) and the lines are long for admission.....this may make some think it is not worth the wait, or they are expecting to see more. What you are experiencing is the intimacy, beauty and splendor of a medieval chapel....if this is not your thing, then no need. It is quite a different experience than Notre Dame, so if you appreciate stained glass and magnificence, then do see it.A note of warning: if you purchaes the Museum Pass, you will NOT have any special access to Sainte-Chapelle. We had to learn this the hard way, as there are seemingly two lines for access, but one line is dedicated to the Palais of Justice, which I believe is a government entity. They will be VERY cranky with you if you try to enter Sainte-Chapelle through this way. The reason the lines are so long is because there is an airport-security type checkpoint before you can pass (the entrance is shared with the Palais of Justice). This can deter lots of people and causes for a LOT of confusion. If you choose to go here, try very early in the morning."

I suspect none of them actually spent any time to appreciate the chapel. Most comment on spending 5 or 10 minutes. If you\u2019re only spending 5 minutes it is a waste of money. I am not a religious person at all but still found it unbelievable. If you actually know what you\u2019re looking at, it\u2019s breathtaking. The lower chapel is unassuming, used for the lower class of 13th century (Yes, 13 Century, it is over 750 years old. Yes 750!!) French society. However the upstairs Royal chapel is fantastic. Each panel of stained glass is a book from the bible. and each pane in each panel tells a chapter from the books. EVERY thing in the bible is there in stained glass. You can \"read' the bible in stained glass. The colors are phenomenal. Each pillar is a carved with an Apostle. The photos on someone's review don't do it full justice. This chapel is also the original vestibule for Jesus' Crown of Thorns and a piece of the cross. The actual crown of thorns!! So deal with the lines and security (it's on the grounds of the Palais du Justice). TAKE YOUR TIME AND SIT AND STARE AT THE WONDERMENT AROUND YOU. This isn't Disney World or Times Square. So you can see why those who spent 5 minutes didn't get much out of it. I like this chapel better than Notre Dame and neck and neck with St. Sulpice."

To those who complain about the cost of seeing this lovely place while being elbowed by hoards of people, at a high ticket cost, I sympathise. By accident, we found the absolutely perfect way to see and enjoy it, at a reasonable price.First, it is true that the lines during the day (in tourist season) are long just to get though the metal detector. But, once inside go to the ticket booth and see what the concert schedule looks like (sometimes confusing, as there may be an early and late concert the same evening, e.g., 7:00 and 9:00). This still will require waiting in line to get the tickets (but my recollection is that there is a separate window for concert tickets, over to the side near the doorway into the Palais de Justice), but it's worth it. Also, I seem to recall that when you show up for the concert, the entry is actually through the big wrought iron and gilt gates of the Palais de Justice as well.The best time to hear music is in summer when there is late sunlight. One of my very favorite Paris memories is a concert at Sainte Chappelle on the night of the summer solstice, listening to a chamber orchestra play Vivaldi and just gazing around the room. It made me feel that I could sense what it would have been like 700 years ago for those who went there for a quiet time of contemplation, or for those who served there as the clerical staff. When the late evening light is coming through the stained glass, and the music is playing, it's absolutely magical."
