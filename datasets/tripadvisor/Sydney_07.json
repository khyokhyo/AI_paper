Apart from the paths through the garden, there is a path that follows the water from Woolloomooloo to the Opera house with the most spectacular views of the harbour and the city. It is also a wonderful picnic spot."

The place is quite big so even when it's busy you can still find a quiet area to have a picnic or just chill out. You can also walk round and get a great view of the opera house and harbour bridge.Would definitely recommend a visit if you are in Sydney."

There was a cute train that you can buy tickets for and the ride is about 30 minutes long. Since we did not have unlimited time, this was a wonderful way to see much of the gardens. Also very convenient for those with small children or elderly due to the amount of walking you would do to see the gardens."

A magic place to stroll through and a wonderful great showcase for the trees and plants of Australia, as well as some other countries. The layout is exceptional and as with everything in Australia, well maintained to a high standard. There are also water features that you can stop and sit at to relax with the sound of the water bubbling away in the background. Or you can stop at the caf\u00e9 and have a coffee or snack on your way round. The paths lead you around the park and eventually to the Opera House and Harbour Bridge."

Take enough time to find not only trees, but to watch the antics of the sacred ibises, the cockatoos, and find the eels who live in the pond near the harbor shore--they actually slither to the pond from the ocean on high tide nights. When I first came years ago, I was mesmerized by the tall and unusual trees--now I enjoy seeing the unusual sports played on all the lawns. Think twice about the new Calyx building--you pay $20 to read posters about how chocolate is grown and eat a \"free\" chocolate chip--just pass by and enjoy your stroll."

The three colours of Wisteria are spectacular to walk under in spring. Take your own picnic or have lunch at the cafe or restaurant located in the gardens. There are public toilets.

The RBG is a drop-dead gorgeous spot to spend at least three hours when it's a fine day.The gardens are a tranquil spot, ideal for a picnic lunch to be enjoyed on the grassy slopes overlooking Sydney Harbour. There are many rare and exotic plants and there are usually plenty of volunteers on hand to answer any questions.On this visit we went through the new Calyx exhibition space that replaced the old glass pyramid. It currently houses a living green wall made up of thousands of plants that illustrates the history of chocolate. Beautifully presented, with many interesting exhibits. Also of special interest is the Fern House and the nearby Orchid House.Free entry to the gardens but there is an entry fee to Calyx, with a discount available if you book online. We dined at the very good cafe onsite. An excellent meal for reasonable cost; wait staff, who seemed to be mostly young backpackers, were pleasant, very friendly and courteous. Highly recommended."

Too many tourists lined up for a good picture of the Macquarrie Chair. People forget others want a chance too. Saw a few wedding parties there for photos and one ceremony. Great view of the Opera House and Bridge from the bay. I think there needs to be two gates open to access Government House. I realize it is probably for security reasons, but we walked all the way around the whole darn thing and then found we were too late for a tour."

( I use to come as a child regularly, my husband and I use to come here for romantic picnics, out door movies , and a few glorious weddings all pre children) On Sunday with Sydney weather at its glorious , I decided that the family could be out in the sun shine , walking and taking in the rose garden , the duck and eel ponds. Seeing incredible ferns, the chocolate exhibition( who doesn't like free chocolate and a chance to see a wall of Lindt chocolate whilst learning incredibly interesting history about chocolate. )not to mention the incredibly gorgeous indoor vertical gardens Whether your a visitor to Sydney or have the gift of having this beautiful parkland on your doorstop. Take advantage We walked , we marvelled , we ate at the cafe , we all got out in the sunshine ( without the internet ) and got reacquainted with a priceless gem. I have visited many botanical gardens throughout my travels around the world. This one is special as it shares space with our magnificent harbour. Looking forward to returning soon. It's just like catching up with an old friend you haven't seen in a while and picking up where you left off. Questioning why you don't make the time to truly enjoy yourself more often. Highly recommend"

You can walk along the shore of Sydney Harbour right next to the Sydney Opera House. In the gardens there are specimens of all kinds of trees, bushes and flowers. You can even take a tour with a guide if you want to and even ride a road train around the gardens. If you want to see all of the gardens you will need to give a couple of hours to see everything. Take my advice and after seeing the gardens walk along the harbour side promenade around to Mrs Macquarie's Chair about 5 to 10 minutes away. The Governor's wife in the colonial days used to sit here and look out over the beautiful harbour - I wonder if she was dreaming of home?"

It really is a very small garden inside a temperature-controlled environment. Nothing like what you see in Gardens by the Bay in Singapore. The tour would not be more than 15 minutes. There is a feature called Sweet Addiction which is a slightly unique offering and you get free chocolates which is a plus. There is an interactive video area which we tried and enjoyed, however, a rude staff named Annaleise told us to hurry up and leave as she has a class to do for a small group of kids! There was no sign anywhere indicating that if a class was to occur, visitors should leave. Besides, we were there first and no one else was in a queue waiting for their turn. I got upset and gave my feedback but there was no manager there so I had to write my comments on a piece of scratch paper which the other staff gave me and I was so sure would not be passed on. Granted this was the only thing we enjoyed in that experience, it was such a disappointment to get that kind of rude treatment from their staff. Please, more training on respect and customer service!"

This exhibition seemed a bit overpriced, although the glasshouse of Sth American tropical rainforest plants was worthwhile. We also visited the glasshouse which told the tale about the Palace that was built in 1879 and then destroyed by fire three years later. A fascinating part of Sydney's history.The highlight of the day was watching some young men strip down to their undies and jump into the harbour to rescue a small flock of very young ducklings while the duck parents wandered about looking for them.If you have an hour or two to spare, I would strongly recommend the gardens at present. The shop is worth a visit as is the cafe."

It was a wonderfully interesting and informative experience as well as enjoying the beauty of the wall gardens. A most original concept. The gardens were so well maintained except for the herb sections which were in need of some rejuvenation and new plantings as well as better labeling of plant names.As there appears to be only the restaurant and one other cafe in the gardens it would be beneficial to have either a coffee cart or pop-up food outlets around the waterfront and other places to serve refreshments.We also wondered about the difficulties of elderly people accessing the gardens as it is a massive area for aged people to walk around. Are there any transport options for elderly or disabled people to use?On a positive note we thoroughly enjoyed the wide open spaces and the feeling of total relaxation as we discovered many little hidden areas as well as the magnificent old trees which must hold a wealth of history in their branches.We'll be back for sure!"

After all, it's right next to the Opera House, and you're probably going there anyway. In late May and June, part of Vivid Sydney is in the gardens, and that is certainly a sight to see.

It also had my hubby and I in tears with the history boards, quite profound the paradigm of effect from our own history books or lack of the opposite coin recorded. I was not impressed by the cafe, thought it could be so much better given the amazing surrounds and captivity of visitors...maybe that's the problem! We wandered through the shop and spent some coinage there then continued through and out the gardens to the art gallery.My one disappointment this time (2nd) was the lack of bats, I was mesmerised by them on my 1st visit a few years ago. I so wanted to give my other half that same experience but it seems they were the cause of much mischief and had to go...I can imagine, if I were to work near by, this would be the place I'd have my picnic lunch with a good book, if I could take my eyes away from my surroundings...also a place to enjoy photography/sketching/painting/discovering..."

This review has two parts: one with an appeal to Sydneysiders and one to travellers.To locals: we often tend to forget to enjoy some of the local spots of our beautiful city, which is a complete shame. I've overheard so many saying \"One day is more than enough to get to know Sydney!\" and I think to myself... \"What?\"Sydney has heaps to offer (sadly for night party animals this city might be a bit dull as some of our rulers are complete idiots), from the parks to the sights to the food. Out of all these I love the Botanic Gardens. After I've been to a meet up or going to the CBD for any reason I spend a while walking around the garden, laying on the ground or just looking at the beautiful sight.To travellers: once you have walked to the Sydney Opera House, you are (literally) steps away from these beautiful gardens, lots of local fauna and an enjoyable relaxation time. Walk from SOH (Sydney Opera House) to Mrs Macquarie Chair, the breeze takes almost any problem away (with the exception of feeling cold if you are not properly suited) while you walk away from the noise of the city. Once on Mrs Macquarie Chair, look back at the Opera House and be amazed at the beauty of this the scene, with the Harbour Bridge as the background of it all.At that moment, you could escape for a quick swim on the lovely pool next to it (you'll have to pay) or get a cultural afternoon and just escape quickly to the Art Gallery of NSW.Best views are around dawn and sunset (I prefer sunset).Enjoy!"

From the Opera House it's a walk down the steps and a turn left and you're in the Botanic Gardens, which also overlooks Sydney's beautiful Harbour. Obviously best on a sunny day. The Botanic Gardens have several sections of different flora. There are Cafe's and in the Summer, many events, such as outdoor plays and Open-air Cinema. If you walk \"too far\", you will end up at the NSW Art Gallery or another wonderful \"play\" area of Woolloomooloo."

Of course you cannot miss the Royal Botanic Garden - a major botanical garden located in the heart of Sydney. The garden was opened in 1816 and it is the oldest scientific institution in Australia and one of the most important historic botanical institutions in the world. It is open every day of the year and access is free. It is positioned on Sydney Harbour and immediately adjacent to the Sydney Central Business District, the Sydney Opera House and the large public parklands of The Domain. You can spend hours in this garden. There are many walks with beautiful views of Sydney Harbour and Central Business District. A lot of different birds and specifically Cacadu parrots are everywhere and very noisy bunch. Beautiful garden with beautiful views! Highly recommend!"

Birds singing, a slight warm breeze, families young & old, individuals all wandering to look around. Most amazingly was the noise level was so low. From various angles we could see Kirribilli Point where the Prime Minister \"stays\" during their time in government; Pinchgut Island, snippets of houses across the harbour.It was so amazing that amongst all this, the noise level was so low, you wouldn't believe that just over the rise was the Opera House full of visitors walking along Circular Quay, many others having a drink or something to eat!The ferries sounded more like a loud hum as they took passengers to or from their destinations as we approached the end of our walk. The little gift shop was a delight to visit with so many treasures to choose from; without a doubt you certainly walk out with something not only for yourself but other family members!Staff members willing to answer any queries about the gardens, sign posts to help with plant names, maps to show where you are within the gardens or a small map to carry with you so you can go any way you like!So if you have some spare time, go for a walk, you'll feel refreshed & better for it!

The glass house (paid entry) is home to beautiful tropical plants and is closer to Elizabeth street. There is a cafe in the centre and a restaurant with small take away cafe attached near the free art gallery. Parking is very expensive so try to walk or bus. Easy access for wheelchairs/prams. Sundays Government house is open for tours well worth a look. Small train tootles around, for a fee , on weekends. Can be busy with weddings and tour buses run constantly up and down the single file Art gallery Road. Friends of gardens have their own shop and there are often botanical exhibitions and talks in the Maiden theatre. Summers has plays and outdoor cinema/opera so it is well used. As it backs onto the Opera House great for a meet up before a show although beware gates close at sunset."

I used to stop in at David Jones Food Hall on the way for great bread, salads, dips, olives & vino. It is just near St James train station & you can stroll up to gardens via Hyde Park and the Archibald Fountain & magnificent St Mary's CathedralEnter via the Domain & stop in at NSW Art Gallery (if you have an extra hour or so), then along coastal route to east past the Andrew (Boy) Charlton pool to Mrs Macquarie's Chair. This is great view back to the Sydney Harbour Bridge & Opera House. Keep following the coast path back south to Farm Cove. This is where you'll officially enter the Botanic Gardens from the DomainFind some higher ground & enjoy your picnic. If you find the right spot you'll be able to see Harbour Bridge &/or Opera House, plus all the sail boats and ferries. Then continue around the Farm Cove coast to the Opera House. It's a great way to spend 3-4 hours, but you can walk it in around 40-60 mins otherwise. Have fun!Note: opening hours are available on the website & gates into the gardens will be locked (The Domain is never locked). Unfortunately, they don't open early enough in summer (7am, yet sunrise is 530am). Such a waste of a fantastic walking track"

Apart from some very majestic and certainly mature trees (one of which is simply stunning) the plants, bushes and flowers have been carefully selected to maximise the visualise brilliance of this area. (I was saddened to see a sign saying that if you see any thefts being carried out, you needed to report these to the authorities.) Simple seating, benches and unobtrusive arbours are available for relaxation. Lots of opportunities here for ornithologists - and budding artists."

We went on a beautiful day.The garden was lovely, I just wish it was a little more colourful, perhaps during the spring and summer it would receive full marks from me.I have nothing to complain about and would look forward to seeing it again. The best part of it is that it is so big with so many trails that you can go multiple times and enjoy new sights.If I go in the future I would try and get a free tour thata run at 10;:30 daily from the info kiosk."

A sunny Monday morning in Sydney was the excuse for my son and I to visit the Royal Botanic Gardens.Arriving just after 10am, the weather was absolutely gorgeous with clear blue sky and a warm 20 degrees as we strolled around enjoying the great range of plants that the Garden staff carefully maintains. We also walked to Mrs Macquarie's Point for the fantastic views across the harbour to the Bridge and Opera House. I guess the Gardens will delight both the enthusiastic amateur (like myself) and those with a serious passion for horticulture. As lunchtime approached, the Garden filled with tourists, and Sydney residents taking a run around the Garden. There was also a big film crew filming what looked to be a 1920/1930s period piece. For me this is one of Sydney's real treasures.Entry is free and it's a wonderful civic amenity holding informative events regularly throughout the year, which complement the standing educational displays. Breakfast, lunch and drinks are available in the Garden's Restaurant and Cafe. There's also a Garden Shop and Plant Sales. A terrific place to spend a morning, afternoon or all day that should be on everyone's Sydney 'must do' list."

Public transport to the gardens is easy but it is just as easy to walk from the Opera House or Circular Quay railway station to get there. The gardens are adjacent to Government house and to the Conservatorium of Music so there is much Sydney History to be done just getting there. We spent a lot of time at the first encounters garden and although there is a guided tour explaining the early Sydney landscape at settlement there are also excellent boards highlighting the history of the Cadigal people at the time of colonisation. Food and drinks are available from stalls in the gardens and I personally found the tour both educational and extremely interesting. Well worth a half day visit."

I thought, this better be good!On entry, we received a single ball of Lindt chocolate each, and didn't receive any more throughout the whole exhibition! This attraction is LAME!!!As Lindt is a company with lots of money, and they were sponsoring this attraction, I would think that they would have been able to spare a little more chocolate then one piece each... I mean come on! It's meant to be a chocolate garden!!!Yes, it was full of jungle plants, but when Dad exclaimed in excitement at seeing a real cocoa plant, Mum was quick to point out that the cocoa beans were literally tied on with string!!!It also had some panels full of information about cocoa bean processing, and a few interesting facts, but none of this information washout the Australian cocoa industry. Finally, the whole thing was mainly advertising for Lindt chocolate. I strongly advise you don't waste money on this!!!!! DISAPOINTING."

Kids playing hide and seek around the bases of the large trees, playing catch in the vast grassed spaces, joggers running along the paths, and older folks just strolling along the sea wall watching for fish on the harbour's edge. Great on a sunny day, not great on a wet one. The gardens are full of native plants from all over the world. There are enormous trees covered in vines and beautiful roses in beds near the entrances. There are stone covered shelters for humans to protect you from the hot sun. There are loads of places for picnics, too. Even fauna abounds, including fruit bats in the evenings. There are free guided walks around the gardens every day at 10.30 am, but look at the web site for other times. The park is very romantic and would be a great place to propose marriage or have a romantic meal at the restaurant. Even on busy days, I find the park a tranquil place to think and ponder life. If you are botanically minded you will love reading all the labels on the tags on the plants and trees all around the park. Also visit the Growing Friends' Nursery at the rare and endangered plants. Lots to see if you want to and a good place to relax if you don't.A place that is highly recommended."

I've travelled a lot (yes thats a boast), I've seen some of the most stunning places on earth, natures beauty at it's most raw from Africa to the US and back again. However I've never found something manmade quite as calming and beautiful as the Botanic Gardens.I'm going to be honest here, I get terrible hay fever, so plants etc are not really my cup of tea. However I was staying at Potts Point and thought a nice walk around to the bay would be the perfect way to see the Harbour etc. I wasn't actually that fussed about walking through the Gardens until I got in there. The animals, the plants, they all just took my breath away, and as you follow the water around you get some stunning views of the Opera House and the Bridge.I stopped for some food in the cafe in the gardens (one of the best chocolate brownies I've ever tasted) and sat outside on the benches. A kookaburra decided it wanted to share my brownie, as did a couple of other local birds. I felt like a Disney princess! After the rest I walked the rest of the way around the bay, in some of the most beautiful scenery on earth. It's a stunning place..as long as the sun is shining obviously."

The Calyx is a long living wall of plants, in itself of some interest, but currently there is an associated attraction called Sweet Addiction, The Story of Chocolate.It cost around $17 each to enter the facility, were we just interested in the living wall, but we still had to pay to see it. We were in and out in 5 minutes. it was most disappointing - we simply had to regard the entry fee as a donation to the gardens.Why not provide free entry with a donation box as occurs with many overseas institutions.Please do your homework before you go, we could not recommend this \"attraction\" to anyone at this price."

When I was first in Australia about 10 years ago I spent a fair amount of time at the Botanical Gardens as it was close to where I was staying and there was a lot of nice scenery plus a lot of great plants that we don\u2019t have in Canada so it was quite interesting. It\u2019s a great place to sit under a tree, read a book, chat with friendly co-eds and enjoy the outdoors, there\u2019s always someone looking for an extra person to play soccer or ultimate so it\u2019s a good social exercise. The Royal Botanic Gardens is celebrating its 200th anniversary this year so that is very cool and it is in great shape thanks to the dedicated groundskeepers. Great way to spend an afternoon walking the paths looking at the flora and close to the Opera House and Central Business District."

It's a big place with lots of nooks and crannys to have a picnic, play a game or just hang out in the sun.

A big garden in the mid of Sydney CBD with thousands of trees, some are very old more than 200 years old, and this garden just recently celebrated its 200 years anniversary. It covers more than 30 hectares as well as the domain approx. with the same size. It is truly a green oasis in the mid of surrounding concrete buildings. Moreover, the visitors can also use the garden walkways with undulating terrains as the physical exercises paths for run, brisk walk or simply relax strolling around the garden. Simply, it just a free park for the family, some just use this place for a big family gathering, nice. A small train \u201cthe Choo Choo express\u201d run every 30 minutes in this garden for visitors with $10 ticket adult, for 25 minutes exploration. Next to the water front and adjacent to Sydney Opera House visitors can combine these two places in one trip."

The Botanical Gardens were right next door and offered a great opportunity for a relaxing stroll among lots of trees, shrubs etc. Plus an opportunity to see various kinds of birds. A great vantage point for some different pictures of the harbour and the Opera House. Also worth just putting a jacket down and relaxing for a few minutes to watch the locals go by. Its a very popular place to exercise There are no entrance charges and once in the park there many exit points for you to enter the city. So you can cover a lot of ground in 1-2 hours of strolling around. There are places to buy ice cream or cold drinks.2016 is the 200th anniversary so there are some special exhibits to look at."

Easy access is gained from Circular Quay train station, ferries or buses. I highly recommend a visit.The gardens are beautifully laid out, have seats and expansive grassy areas for resting, picnicking or admiring the world class views. In Spring there are stunning annual garden beds.There are water features and ponds which attract a small range of water birds.Sometimes there are botanical art and other exhibitions on site.Often there are plants for sale run by volunteers but I'm not sure if this only occurs on weekends or not.The gardens have a basic caf\u00e9 which could improve in food variety and quality, and a restaurant which I haven't tried."

I took the free 1 1/2 guided tour from the Opera House gates at 11am. Mostly they leave at 10.30am and it's a good idea to book the tour. Our guide was excellent. He was considerate finding shady places to explain the trees and monuments. His commentary was informative and interesting and sometimes funny. I've been here before but never noticed the eels in the pond which he told us come on ocean streams from New Caledonia and return there to procreate and die. If you don't have the time for the tour it's a wonderful place to wander around and bring a backpack lunch to enjoy. There is a caf\u00e9 near the pond which serves coffee and snacks or a restaurant if you want something more substantial. There are several entry points and the one near the Mitchell Library has a statue of Governor Philip - the first governor of NSW. The gardens are extremely well kept and have plants from many exotic places. If it's history you like, beautiful views of Sydney Harbour, a horticultural buff or just looking for some peaceful place then this is the place for you. Best of all it's FREE."

The smell of their droppings was revolting and they shrieked and squealed all day. No-one would touch them because they are a protected species in New South Wales. But common sense has finally prevailed and the bats have been moved on (don't ask how, Greenies may be offended) and the gardens are again the most beautiful and relaxing spot in Sydney.

At first you might say, why walk thru another park, but the beauty and calm of meticulously manicured lawns and flower gardens and spectacular trees is a treat for the eyes. Do this in conjunction with a visit to the Opera House. From the front steps of the Opera House, bear left and thru the gates less than 100 meters. The area is narrow as Macquarie St. is on one side and the harbor the other, so you are able to view most of the Gardens. Good pathways also. I was blown away by the trees, shapes, and unusual and rare species for this part of the world. Nice coffee shop/restaurant to take a break."

The Fruit bats live here, so if you think it has started to rain, look up, there are probably hundreds dropping things on top of you. Watch the beautiful sight as they curl up in huge numbers at night and fly around the city, truly a sight to remember.

The gardens hold a wonderful collection of plants from all over the world but also from throughout Australia's past. See the Farm Cove garden plots which show what was grown by those on the First Fleet while also learning about the impact on the indigenous people at the time.Dotted throughout the Gardens are rotundas and picnic shelters. It was raining, on and off, while we were there but we weren't bothered. It was a great nature break in the midst of a longer city break."

You have the gardens with ponds, Palm Groves, Palm House, Begonia Gardens, Succulent garden, Pioneer Garden , Rose Garden, Oriental Garden, Old Mill Garden. Palace Garden Areas of vast Lawns with harbors and trees and benches, Rockery and fountains. A wonderful stop in the middle is the Cafe and shop. Also found is the Maiden Theatre, plants growing and sales, Sydney Fernery, Education Centre, Government house and Parade grounds adjacent to Palace garden, Rathborne Lodge, Well thats a lot so i will post a pic of the grounds map and some of the things we saw. Kids will like the walkway train. Enjoy the bayside walk and work your way into the gardens on top of the hillsides and work your way back under the shade of the trees to keep cool.

There is an indoor rainforest experience (entry fee applies), a large cactus garden, ponds, wildlife, and stunning flowers and fauna. There is a restaurant, shop and kiosk, but it is lovely, and cheaper, to just take your own picnic. Start from the city gates and work your way down to Mrs Macquarie's Chair and Point. Take in the stunning harbour views as you walk down to the Sydney Opera House. Lots of photo opportunities. To fully enjoy everything on offer allow yourself 2-3 hours, longer if you are having a picnic. Great place to relax, recharge, and take in the ambience of amazing Sydney. Fantastic free activity for all ages."

When working I jogged through them most days so beautiful. Lunch time office workers and running clubs use the road way and stairs to keep fit and the run along the water is so relaxing. There are beautifully decorated bubblers to drink out of as well. Walking around you will come across a garden people can touch, taste, and smell herbs, chillies and lemons and other things. The rose garden has wonderful array of colours, you can walk around an old fashion vegetable garden, see fruit trees from other parts of the world, follow a small creek with gentle water falls with their family of ducks, to delights little children, and enjoy the beautiful flowers. Walk far enough up the back and see the many bats hanging from the trees. Also the glass house with exotic plants, and insects. The gardens are full of so many different things your day will be full. The gardens are for everyone to enjoy."

All found descriptions were presenting this place in not too attractive ways.Living in nearby hotel one morning we decided to reach Opera and Circular Quay by walking through the Garden. It is so nice, green and peaceful place that it is impossible to omit. If you are not in hurry you can easily appreciate atmosphere and character of this park. Combination of blooming flowers, huge green areas beautifully maintained with blue color of sea and sky makes you soul be happy.We were very delighted to be there."

We also found the Government House and went on a free tour (RECOMMENDED!!) You can get to the Gardens by walking behind the Opera House or there is a small tram that will take you there. It loads near the overhead train on the dock, closest side to the Opera House."

You can in fact have a guided tour in a small train from the Opera House around the gardens and back. If you have time the walk is worth the effort. There is also a kiosk for a coffee or lunch break.

Also the Art gallery of NSW is about a 10 minute walk. Theres no entry fee for that either so once again a great place for travelers on a budget. if you circle around and find yourself near Wooloomooloo, try out a hot-dog at Harry's cafe de wheels. Once again you'll get a cheap great meal with a view of the navy ships. if you are a hardcore nature lover i suggest you also visit Wendy Whitelye's secret garden, its well worth it."

Once we left the tour we continued to walk. Stopping to sit on a bench or rest in the grass and take in the views. We saw local joggers, kids on school trips it was fun. As we meandered on we made our way to Ms. Quarles' bench and then finally to Wooloomooloo. Don't ask me how we got there but it we did.

We saw Bottle Trees, Gingko Bilhoba Trees, learnt where the phrase to knock on wood came from and many interesting facts.There were the gardens of the first settlers and the herbarium where they store all the seeds from the past for future generations and for scientific research.It would be great to revisit and do it when our feet weren't so tired....."

Everybody seemed to be having a great time.The walk from the Sydney Opera House to Mrs. MacQuaries point will take about 90 minutes, but will provide you with excellent views (and photo ops) of the opera house, Sydney Harbor and the Harbour Bridge. Its well worth it.The Royal Botanic Gardens are very clean, well maintained and safe. However, they do close at night.The gardens are celebrating their 200th anniversary in 2016.

We entered a magical world of pagodas, fire breathing Chinese dragons and 5 story high towers looming down on the audience high above the purpose built stage. Turandot is the age old love story of love finally conquering all but it has many overtones of traditional east vs west distrust. It is a wonderful spectacle with a huge cast combining elements of traditional Italian and Chinese Opera directed by Chen Shi-Zheng. It is sung in Italian but there are subtitles in English and Chinese. Outstanding performances were from Hyeseoun Kwon who play Liu, the ill fated slave of Prince Calaf who is wooing Turandot at great stakes. She sings with passion and great beauty. Riccardo Massi does a beautiful job of the famous aria \"Nessum Dorma\" meaning no one sleeps while he waits for an answer regarding marriage from Turandot. Dragana Radakovic playing Turandot could bring more passion to the piece but she is playing an \" Ice Princess\". The three advisors to the Emperor \"Ping, Pang and Pong\" provide excellent comic relief. As the sun set on the stage before the performance it provided a wonderful spectacle with the backdrop of the Sydney Opera House and Harbour Bridge. We dined before we came as we found food was expensive and limited choice. It is nice to have a drink at interval gazing over the harbour. We took cushions to make ourselves more comfortable. We parked in the Domain carpark and caught the shuttle bus to and from the venue which worked fairly well. A memorable experience for 35th wedding anniversary!"

The gardens are really extensive, they seem larger than Central Park in NYC, and really quite beautiful. It's so peaceful, and for someone like me who loves to explore the flora of the place I am visiting, it was really special. I was in awe of the large fig trees which seem almost surreal and alienlike - so different from what we have in upstate New York. On my next visit I will be sure to take a good book and maybe a bottle of really good Australian wine and sit under a fig tree for the afternoon."

You can sit and relax, no need to rush. also head to the Art Gallery from here but the best way is to go via Lady Macquaries chair and follow the path that runs along the sea towards Boy Charlton pool then up to the AGNSW."

All areas (rest rooms, dining, etc.) were \"a 1 minute walk\" but then the trails wound around so deviously that things were difficult to find. Even a sign for the rest rooms from the dining cafe was off: it said to go around the side of the \"gift shop\" for RRs, but they named the gift shop a \"Garden Shop\" so it was confusing. Plants were not groups pleasantly or marked consistently. It's just fine for a park, but not the greatest for seeing a great variety of native species. That said, the walks just out side it (to Mrs. Macquaries' chair, for instance) were lovely!"

Look at a map of central Sydney and you will notice that the city has been blessed by sharing as much open space and parks as it does with the built up landscape. The three major green spaces that make up much of this area, Hyde Park, The Domain and The Royal Botanical Gardens are all linked and not unlike St James' and Green parks in London, flow naturally from on to the next. In Sydney's case however, it is down towards the Harbour that you are drawn.It's a great way to relax by strolling through the whole green space or start outside the old Sydney Hospital at the top of Martin Place, cut through this historic precinct and out onto the Domain which also doubles as playing fields for the \"office bound\" to let off steam at lunchtime. Directly across the Domain is the Art Gallery of NSW - worth sometime on its own - or turn left (North) and stroll into the Botanic Gardens where in the early colonial days, gardens were established to help feed the infant Sydney Town. One of the early Georgian gardens declared in 1816, the \"RBG\" is a priceless jewel for any city and is still an active botanical laboratory. Shaded palmways, bubbling creeks and sweeping lawns head down hill to the semi circular stone harbour wall. To your left is the Opera House, the right hand point is \"Mrs Macquaries Seat\" named after the wife of Sydney's most progressive colonial Governor, and arguably Sydney's finest viewpoint.There are a couple of reasonable food outlets, great for a sunny lunch, and in early Autumn, there is Grand Opera performed on floating stages along side Farm Cove with the Opera House and Harbour Bridge as a magnificent backdrops. 2015 was Aida - the best Ive seen - 2016 is Turandot...not to be missed.Feel like a swim on a warm day, visit 'Boy' Charlton Pool on the Harbour's edge. A swank public pool that enjoys a reputation for eye candy!So The Botanical Gardens in Sydney - a green lung for the city that overlooks it..."

There are many beautiful gardens- I love the rose gardens when in season. There are wonderful views from behind the Opera house or Mrs Macquaries chair where on the weekend you can see yacht races. If you have children there is enough space for them to run wild without getting in the way. As you enter one of the entrance gates have a good look at the map to work out where you want to go.

We had quite a large tour, probably 15-20 people (the guide said it was the largest he had ever had), but it worked well. The guide answered all questions and there was plenty of time for pictures.

The views are to die for and there are many places to sit and just watch the passing parade. We put a picnic basket together and spent bout 4 hours here. Could have spent the whole day very easily!! Come and check it out. You won't be disappointed!!!"

Even as locals we tend to visit the Botanical Gardens every few years, not only as a relaxing, peaceful stroll but also to see the various seasonal changes and to take in special events that are held there on a regular basis. Then there is the backdrop setting of Sydney Harbour, a sight in itself. Our last visit coincided with the Sydney Tomato Festival. We bought some produce but overall it was on a small scale.GL"

The botanical gardens were recommended by a good friend and it certainly lived up to the recommendation. There's something here for everyone, great wildlife, water features, stunning scenery and above all a place to take time out relax and enjoy the stunning views. We thought the garden cafe was very good value for money, with quality menu choices over and above the standard expectations. The sunshine made it a very memorable day, so what are you waiting for, get going and see for yourself !"

I would suggest that you splash the cash and first take the little Choo Choo train which winds its way around the main attractions in this extensive garden to gauge which areas you wish to explore further on foot. There is something to please anyone with a love of nature from historic trees to displays of agricultural methods, not to mention the many sculptures dotted throughout. Appropriately, there are several establishments available in the grounds for much needed refreshments. After immersing yourself in the history and culture of the Harbour Bridge and Sydney Opera House what better way to chill out than in the beautiful and peaceful Botanical Gardens?"

Staying at Ovolo Wolloomooloo on the pier, this was a quick 5 minute walk, on the harbour peninsula directly east of the opera house. I have toured many botanic gardens around the world and this one did not disappoint! A very enjoyable section was the tree fern garden, showcasing at least 12 different species, many of which I have never encountered in over 30 years in the horticultural industry. The succulent garden was equally impressive, covering a large area with high diversity. Definitely worth a repeat visit!"

So peaceful away from the hustle and bustle of the City, extending to 75 acres of some of the rarest plants in the world so beautifully presented. If you are not one for a lot of walking, there is a very pleasant little train to ferry you round which you can get on/off as and when required. A particularly pleasant cafe and gift shop is one of the ports of call to quench thirst, dine or simply take in the atmosphere.One must always mention Mrs Macquaries chair is perhaps the most famous of all icons in Sydney and is a must for a photograph !!!So much to see and do and all free. To think that the first settlers only came into Sydney in 1788, so much has been achieved both in the city and more over in the incredible Royal Botanical Gardens. Enjoy."

My wife and I were spending our first morning in Sydney as part of our tour of Australia and strolled down to Circular Quay in the early morning sun and made our way to the botanical gardens.It was a delight. The gardens are beautifully laid out and ibis proudly paraded the greens in search of food oblivious to the many tourists taking photos of them. We saw beautiful jacaranda trees which were in flower and which were in abundance here and indeed everywhere we went in Sydney. Water features and statues abound. The flower beds are beautifully tended. Amorous couples smooched on the green lawns. There is something extra special about a park in a big city and the botanical gardens are no exception. As we made our way towards the Opera House we encountered the wonderful panorama of the harbour below us. This is an excellent walking experience, colourful, serene and tranquil with points of interest everywhere."

Maybe I just had high expectations, but I thought there would be more blossoms of different flower varieties to see. What was there was attractive, but it just seemed more like a giant park with lots of open green space and a few flowers.One cool thing, though, was the lake which is full of eels...and which the interpretive board says was cleaned out of eels but then mysteriously they came back within 2 weeks.

The botanic Gardens is the natural link for visiting a lot of beautiful places in Sydney. In other words get a map and think in terms of using the Gardens as a route to enjoy for getting to places. The very best view of the Opera house and Harbour bridge and harbour is to be had from the end of the peninsular at Mrs MacQuarie's chair... its the pic you must have if you come to Sydney.The Gardens in themselves are just beautiful.. natural calm fascinating exotic and native, framed by the harbour. good signage tells you what its all about and a great little kiosk is a perfect place to have a quiet rest or snack or lunch.If you leave Sydney without seeing the Botanical Gardens then you have missed a real treasure by world standards... and its free and its there for you to enjoy..

On a dry day it's a pleasure walking especially on the seawall path towards the Opera House and watch the Harbour traffic.The Garden, a large natural amphitheatre, is divided in 4 parts:Lower, Middle, Palace Gardens & the Bennelong Precinct. In the Palm Grove you'll find a Cafe, Garden Shop, a Restaurant and a bookshop.Huge trees like the Moreton Bay Figs, birds like sulphur-crested cockatoos and Australian white ibis, many pic-nic areas, beautiful pavilions and many sculptures like the Wuirrunbgwuri ecological creation, a rose garden and historical buildings to visit like the Government House and the Conservatorium of Music. Try to find out what suits your interests and choose the gate you'll start exploring the Garden, as there are many entrance gates and there is a long distance between them. There is also the Choo-Choo-Express, a hop-on hop-off train with 4 stops around the Garden. 3 carriages with 30 seats. The tour lasts 25 minutes and tickets are available at the Queen Elizabeth II Gate."

A long and relaxed stroll through an informal park that's more than a park, with frequent views onto the harbor, plenty of benches to rest on when its muggy, it all goes to make these gardens a pleasure. Wandering ibis, colorful parakeets, ponds with fish and eels plus trees full of 'flying foxes'/'fruit bats' keep kids and adults amused. For the more serious botanists there's a 'fernery' and a great 'herbarium' (is that what they call it?) with interesting information labels for herbalists or cooks. The park is not just Australian but has many tropical specimens from around the world. I find it more mature and also more densely packed with interest than the gardens in Perth, far larger (for good reason) but also much more varied than the gardens in Singapore, and more 'accessible' and 'informal' than Kew in London, to give some comparisons. There's also an excellent park cafe and occasional displays. A very pleasant place to stroll, rest, picnic or chill and a must do on the Sydney scene. Hey, it's all free too!"

This year marks the two hundredth anniversary of the opening of the gardens and it has provided an oasis of peace and serenity for Sydneysiders ever since. .The well maintained gardens contain some magnificent trees and shrubs and an abundance of wild birds. Entrance is free, and you are positively encouraged to walk on the grass and even hug the trees!Tourists mingle with office workers on their lunch break, picnickers and sun bathers lie on the grass, local joggers speed past and peculiar ibises take it all in and will steal your food if you leave it unattended!There is a pleasant cafe near the centre of the gardens, an RBG shop and ample public toilets. There are free guided walks (although we did not have time to take one) or for 10 Australian dollars (5 for children) you can ride through the gardens on a motorised \"train\" and listen to a commentary from the informative driver.Sydney is justifiably proud of its magnificent Botanic Gardens and if you plan to visit this vibrant and picturesque city you should not miss it."

As it was hot opted for the choo train ride through the gardens which stops at four well spaced locations with on board commentary. You can rejoin every 20 mins or so or just stay on board for the 30 minute ride for $10. Like all gardens there are fern groves, herbs, rare plants etc. But being such an old garden it is the very old and large trees that I enjoyed. Look out for upcoming special events.

The Gift Shop is worth visiting as they sell Honey from the hives in the Botanic Gardens where they have access to all of the flowering plants. We had a really nice breakfast at the cafe which served a yummy bacon and egg roll and coffee and sat out under the trees to eat it. Definitely worth visiting the gardens which provide a peaceful break from the hustle and bustle of Sydney."

I opted to take a different route each time as it's so big that there is plenty to keep you occupied for an entire morning/afternoon. The only negative I have of this place is the service in the cafe that is situated within the grounds was painfully slow. I had to wait around 15-20 minutes for a coffee."

They can be accessed from just outside the opera house and you can continue to walk to the viewing point at Mrs Macquarie's Chair. Refreshments are available at the top of the hill where you can also get great views of the other side of the bay. You can also get the little land train around the gardens if you don't fancy walking it, this is guided but chargeable and leaves every 30 minuites from the gates near the opera house. Pick up one of the free maps available around the gardens to make sure you see everything they also include information about other guided walks which are free. We even did some celeb spotting whilst we were here, Def Leopard were doing a bit of sight seeing too!"

The spectacular, rolling, green expanse of the Botanical Gardens was so haunting it beckoned us back a second time during our 6 day stay in Sydney. I keep re-living that first day of our stay. We decided to explore the neighborhood on foot. With some helpful directions and a street map from the friendly reception guy at our Holiday Inn Potts Point abode we walked down Victoria Street and took the steps down to Woolomooloo Bay then walked on past the Finger Wharf to the steps leading up to the Botanical Gardens. The sheer open vastness of the Gardens, the immaculately laid out greens and the quietude relaxes, energises and romances you, more so if you are with your partner. Plenty of helpful signboards along the way to guide you along because the walk through the Garden also leads you on to the Sydney Opera House, the Sydney Harbour and Circular Quay. What a splendid day that was, absolutely amazing, romantic and memorable. There was even a marriage ceremony going on in the Gardens that day (November14) !! Hundreds of plant species around but you'd need a guided tour to comprehend those. On our second visit, the next day, we lost our way as we did the reverse direction, walking from the Harbour back to our hotel, through the Gardens. It was dark and we missed the signboards and came out on the wrong side of the road, looking for those flight of stairs down to the Woolomooloo Bay which we just couldn't locate. However, thanks to some splendid help from a group of passers-by one of whom whipped out his smart phone with google maps, we eventually made it to those steps !! Yea, we had several instances of getting lost during our wonderful Australia trip."

There are herbs and rose gardens of different varieties you can look at. A real nice tranquil place you should visit. It also offers a nice unobstructed view of the CBD buildings at various locations. You can read about the history of Australia along the way while enjoying the flora and fauna. If you are feeling a little adventurous, do walk a little further to Mrs MacQuarie's chair and you will see a gorgeous view of the Opera house and the harbour bridge. Just make sure you take note of the closing hours of the gate so you do not get locked in when night falls."

What follows is a short precis which I found very useful for this Visit.As keen plantsmen were really looked forward to seeingThe Royal Botanic Gardens.It's located in the heart of Sydney, Australia close to The Opera House and Cafe Sydney. It opened in 1816,and the garden is apparently the oldest scientific institution in Australia and one of the most important historic botanical institutions in the world. It is open every day of the year and access is free. Its stunning position on Sydney Harbour and immediately adjacent to the Sydney CBD, the Sydney Opera House and the large public parklands.The Gardens have much to offer from the rare and threatened plants of the world to the romantic rose garden, the themed garden areas show the diverse beauty of nature. Special features include: Cadi Jam Ora - first Encounters is a garden display that remembers and acknowledges the Cadigal - the original inhabitants of Sydney's city centre - and their relationship with this land. There are Free guided walks daily 10:30am - check this out first though.There's also a restaurant there with usual facilities and the obligatory Shop, which is where the guided walks start.Would highly recommend this just for views of The Opera House and Sydney Harbour Bridge alone!!"

So picked up a ferry in Darling harbour to take us to circular quay about 15 minute ride but boy what a spectacular view under the bridge and past the opera house not a bad start to the day. So we decided to walk through the botanic gardens and take in the sights on the way back to our hotel. Firstly the gardens are free to enter and are immaculately kept. You senses are awakens by the sound of birds calling and then you eyes are treated to the sight of a beautiful array of different coloured birds . We were then treated to the sight of a kookaburra bathing in the bird bath. There are lakes and beautiful coloured trees lining the gardens. The governors house is situated on the headland and overlooks the harbour. If you walk to the headland and follow the path round you come to Mrs Macquaries seat a huge stone seat carved out by the convicts so that she (the governors wife could sit and watch the tall sail ships arriving from England. Well worth a walk through."

When I worked in the CBD a place I would often go to just unwind and eat a sandwich and have a coffee in the middle of the working day but also a place to go for picnics on the weekend. Generally the gates close around dusk however in summer when the open air cinema is operating you can take in a film with the Sydney skyline as the backdrop and enjoy some light food and a drink. The gardens are situated in a beautiful north facing aspect and run from the eastern edge of the CBD to the Domain Lady Macquarie's Chair and the Art Gallery in the East. The gardens feature many lawns and established trees as well as greenhouses and specialised plantings - less emphasis on flowering exhibits than say Adelaide - the main gripe is that the fruit bats have taken up residence in plague proportions - while wildlife should be protected the fact that this is largely an exotic garden seems to fallen been forgotten this wasn't their natural habitat before the garden was created."

And oh how well the City maintains the space and astounding greenery and trees. (And did I mention the live music concerts?)"

The RBG plays a vital role as the lungs of the city, links the harbor, the Rocks, domain and central business district. One can walk along or inside the RBG at any time of the day and of the year. A lot of office workers go for a run at lunch time and definitely veer through the popular gardens."

Unlike most of the world this park area is comfotable & accessible all the year round other than the few days when rain makes it unpleasant. However even in winter the views & the access is generally very good & inviting."

Whenever work load permits, I go for a 35 mins walk in the park at lunchtime. Every time without fail I marvel at how beautiful the harbour and the park are. I like walking in the middle of the park instead of just the walkway along the water. The latter is relatively busy with joggers. There are sections of the park in various themes - rose garden, Asian etc. some spots have nice views of the harbour, Opera House and the Bridge. Refreshing indeed"

If you want peace and looking out to spend some quality time with your family or partner then this is a perfect place. It is very well located, cool and of course shady because of all the trees they have. You can easily access it via train.You can find trees and plants from all over the world here. Even if you are not a botanist I am sure the trees, plants and flowers will definitely attract your attention. You can see the Harbour bridge and the Opera house from one end while you can also walk along the sea shore from one end to the other but the real treasure is in the garden. It should take an entire day to explore the garden.Take an entire day out to visit this place."

It is right next to the Opera House and overlooks the harbor, so the photo opportunities are second to none.They have such a great variety of plants and trees, laid out in a beautiful garden. They also have a large variety of birds, many of which we only see in cages in the US.The garden is easy to get to and very walkable, some stairs and steps, but nothing too strenuous. We visited on a cloudy day and thought it was great, so must be even better in the sun."

Get out in the sunshine and bring a picnic.A word of warning though - look out for Cockatoo #12 - he's a vicious little bugger! My other half was taking photos of a group of other cockatoos and #12 was running around chasing pigeons off. Next thing we know he runs right at my other half and bites one of her toes (she was wearing flip flops) - she tried to back off and run away, but the bird just kept chasing after her until I managed to wave it off."

The park isn't astoundingly beautiful and doesn't have any amazing botanical species that will strike you as incredibly special, but it is a tranquil environment to stroll safely through as the heavy Sydney traffic sits outside in the surrounding roads. The walk down toward the Opera House is very scenic and that in itself, is a botanic garden view that you will not see anywhere else in the world. We exited through the gate nearest the Opera House and this was a great walk to start the day. We were there at 7.30am and the park was very popular with runners."

You will see where the Australian Navy parks it's ships and where the horses in WW1 sailed past here from Wooloomooloo Bay never to return home which brings a tear. There is a kiosk near Mrs Macquarie's chair for a stop. The Botanical gardens are very established and lovely with a cafe and shop.

We spent much more time than we expected to here just wandering around snapping photos. The best views of the Sydney Opera House can be found here. One thing happened that may scare off some people though. A magpie attacked my baseball cap. He was hovering over me, squawking and pecking my hat. I guess he wasn't a Patriots fan! I was told later that that's pretty common with Australian magpies. I found it amusing but I know some people have a fear of birds."

Although there were some interesting trees and shrubs, we were a little disappointed that much of the garden is being refurbished for the 200year anniversary next year. The Harbour side walk is pleasant. There are also interesting historic houses,.Governor's House, oldest greenhouse. We would probably have seen more on a walk. Unlike others I cannot fully recommend this attraction.,...and I am a very keen gardener."

Even if your tour doesn't include it, it is worth walking out afterwards to Macquaries Point to take in the lovely view.The cafeteria serves a good range of light fare and there was plenty of seating available.

In a fantastic location behind the Opera House, I could visit the Government House and Art Gallery within its grounds as well. The gardens are so well looked after, full of perfect green field and colourful flower arrangements, it's full of photography enthusiasts.Also worth mentioning the security personnel around the Government House that were terribly nice and eager to have a chat about the building and functions held. And the little shop and caf\u00e9 which were a great discovery."

I was short-cutting from the harbour to my hotel in Wooloomooloo and ended up extending it zig-zag and wander across the gardens up to Mrs Macquarie's Chair. A 20 minute journey ended up taking an hour and a half because I got so waylaid. Some of the plants, birds and trees here are incredible. On the outdoor edges you look one way to the lush greenery and cockatoos and look the other to see a bustling city. A couple of minutes of walking further in though and the city is long forgotten.The view across to the harbour bridge and opera house from Mrs Macquarie's Chair is one of the best. Was lucky to be there at sunset."

Many water features dot the acreage which attracts plenty of ibis, ducks, and other water birds, and one pond was full of carp and eels. Flowers were plentiful despite it being winter right now so I cannot image how colorful the park is in the spring and summer. We lucked out and got to watch a pair of rainbow lorikeets eating these red flowers off a shrub, and had a close encounter with a couple dozen cockatoos who are not shy about landing on your arm or head! There are restroom and restaurant facilities in the middle of the park, and there's a gift shop with very nice items. Walk the entire waterfront perimeter for all the views but be sure to venture into the interior to enjoy all the gardens. We also saw lots of people enjoying a picnic lunch, jogging, playing games, and even one wedding. Gorgeous!"

The array of plants is amazing, the lawned areas ideal for a picnic and the views of Sydney Harbour sublime. My mother brought me here regularly as a child and I have fond memories of every visit. I regularly make this a must on return visits. There is a great little restaurant within the gardens precinct and you are only a stone's throw away from the Opera house and Circular Quay, with its bistros. But my recommendation is pack a picnic lunch,walk into the gardens through the Domain enjoy the surroundings and exit via the Opera house gate. A fantasic day out & one both you and the kids will enjoy. Whats more, it's free."

Some speciality trees where parrots/ hang around.the only disappointing thing is the train journeys are not as frequent and make you wait for a long time, also with limited capacity leaves a lot of folk disappointed.What you need to watch out for is the limited (only One) toilet deep inside the park, and has long queues.

I was taking a picture of my wife by a rock sculpture when a cockatoo landed on the rock. This was followed by another and another. One of them landed by my feet and I had a cracker in my bag that I gave it. Well, the next thing we knew, we were in the midst of a large flock of cockatoos. I've never seen them in the wild, so this was awesome. A few landed on my wife and myself and I even got one to mimic my talking. This was one of the highlights of our trip to Sydney."

Would not recommend this restaurant to anyone at all. Shame really as this is SYDNEYS BOTANICAL GARDENS and that is why we went there in the first place."

Went there for a short walk and decided to take the Choo Choo rides which last for about 25 minutes and going to 4 key stops. IF you're someone who wants to take nice photographs of the park, DO NOT TAKE THE RIDE. It's not that the ride is not good, but it does not stop at all and you have zero opportunity to take a nice photo. You will end up wanting to walk back to the location you past by to take nice photos. However, DO TAKE THE RIDE if you just want a quick overview of the garden, having some fun and not keen to take really nice photos of the view, the flowers, the fountain, the trees etc. For children it's 5 bucks and adult is 10 bucks. Even though my ride is at 4pm, I got to be seated as early as 3.30pm as the seats are \"first come first serve\" basis. Since I'm not into taking those really nice picture, I think the choo choo ride experience was fine."

The Royal Botanic Gardens, which semi-circles the magnificent Sydney Harbour, is a wonderful retreat from the hustle and bustle of the city. At lunch time, especially during the summer, many office workers will make the effort to come to the gardens with their sandwich lunch, sit under a tree, and just enjoy an hour of quiet and relaxation.Alternatively, it is a wonderful place to slowly walk around part of Sydney Harbour then meander through the various themed gardens.For those seriously interested in flora, the gardens have an astonishing array of native trees, shrubs, plants and flowers., including some glass houses for ferns, orchids and other plants that will not grow outside in Sydney's clime, benevolent as it is.In January, during the Sydney's Festival of Arts, there is a special treat for kids (or parents of kids who want to entertain them for the day during school holidays). The Australian Elizabethan Theatre Trust stages an al fresco performance of \"The Wind in the Willows\".This hour long performance has the kids totally enthralled, although when I took my little granddaughter to the show a couple of years ago, she expressed instant dislike of Mr Fox. (NB: There is no fee for entrance to the Botanic Gardens, but tickets for the Wind in the Willows show are about $25 from memory)."

The birds were amazing, so different from the ones we normally see.The views of Sydney Harbour and the opera house were amazing.There was a cafe that had good food although very expensive. Also where was lots of bathrooms and the one near the gift shop was very clean. I didn't see any of the others. The gift shop had many lovely things and prices varied.The only problem we had was the website said that wheelchairs were available. We went early in the morning so we would be sure to get one and when we got there we were told they only had one and it was booked already. The website said nothing about pre-booking it. When I asked why they only had one I was told the others had been stolen. This is a simple problem to solve, ask people for a large deposit on their credit cards or have them leave a drivers licence that will be returned when the chair is returned."

I just used Google Maps to plan out the route. However, the gardens are absolutely gorgeous. There are tropical plants that I was surprised to see thriving in an allegedly temperate environment. There are also gorgeous artsy sitting areas. Although I used the gardens as a quite and scenic alternative to the typical city streets which I spent most of my time in anyway, the Royal Gardens hosts plenty of free events throughout the year. It's easy to spend several minutes in or an afternoon in. I encourage everyone to grab a coffee and snack and just enjoy the views. I found a nice spot that I could watch the ocean and Sydney Opera House from.Have I mentioned that it's free to go in the gardens?"

Here not only will you find yourself on a journey through an amazing range of environments, such as the hot house, the tropical jungle, the stands of local trees as well as exotics, but you can find a fantastic walled cactus garden and replica of the first farm gardens in Sydney's early European Settlement. There are ponds with ducks and water plants, there is a restaurant and a tea house. There are walkways with some elevation looking down onto the harbours, just behind the Conservatorium for Music, and there are harbour side walks where you may find busy city workers taking their lunch time run. For those with less orientation to the aerobic side of life, there are lawns for having picnic lunches where office workers and families with young children mingle. There are guided tours if you want to hear more in depth about the gardens, and if you don't there are quiet nooks and crannies where you may find lovers seeking privacy, or people contemplating the meaning of life, the universe and everything. Sometimes there are events, like Shakespeare's \"A Midsummer Nights Dream\" performed here at night in the summer. Some of the best ground level views of the harbour are from the Gardens. Tour buses often stop at Lady Macquarie's Chair to take photos of the Harbour Bridge and the Opera House.There is parking along the road that runs between the Art Gallery and the Domain. There are clean toilets and easy access for everyone, including wheelchairs."

There is aa colony of flying foxes that live in the trees, and an abundance of bird life, from cockatoos to ibis' as well as many other varieties that a green oasis like this must attract. There is a lovely cafe/restaurant at it's heart but you know, a picnic hamper and blanket is all you really need. Don't forget to check out the glass pyramid green house, the succulent garden as well as the pond down by harbour. This pond is a known breeding ground of eels (that periodically need clearing out as they would feed on the ducklings) that some how get back into the pond each year. There are some great walking tracks all through out the park but once you're done, exit the gardens via the Opera House. Always a lovely site to finish a wonderful treck."

For fabulous harbour views, walk through the gardens along the harbour wall to Mrs Macquarie's chair, a promontory which juts out into the harbour. There is also a cafe and shop with lovely handicrafts. Avoid taking a car as the parking fees are exorbitant. Use public transport and walk. The nearest train stations are Martin Place and St James, which are on the city circle network. There are also free buses stopping outside the Art gallery of NSW which is located across Gallery Road nearby. There are free guided tours available most days of the week at lunchtime.

These buildings house some little surprises - you should go and see!Of note are the large amounts of bats that roost in the trees during the daytime. At dusk and dawn, you can see their exodous which is quite spectacular. Furthermore, if you look carefully into the trees, you'll see some huge spiderwebs and spiders; certainly gets your hairs on end the first time you see them!Overall, the gardens are a great place to stroll, wind down a little and enjoy the often brilliant weather. Kids will love it too. You can use the gardens as a thoroughfare from Circular Quay to the domain and the Art Gallery of NSW (very good) or Woolloomooloo and the superb restaurants (for lunch or dinner) on Woolloomooloo wharf.Happy trails!"

SYDNEY\u2019S ROYAL BOTANIC GARDENS \u2013 THE EDEN OF THE CITY.Most cities across the world have their own botanical gardens showcasing a picturesque garden variety and lush lawns with an abundance of spots to stop and rest.However, none come close to Sydney\u2019s Royal Botanic Gardens. Its watery boundary stretches from the brim of Circular Quay, following the harbour line right around past Andrew Boy Charlton pool and up to the Art Gallery of NSW and the Domain.Home to the Conservatory of Music, Government House, Herbarium Buildings and the famous landmark 'Mrs Macquarie\u2019s Chair'. This historic sandstone chair was carved out of a rock ledge for Governor Macquarie's wife who loved to sit and admire the panoramic views of the harbour. Who can blame her? One lucky lady. During special events, the gardens come alive with people camping for days to secure their spot. Summer time offers movies under the stars, Wind in the Willows family production (at a fee), high tea at the caf\u00e9 and a train which provides commentary of its flora and fauna within the gardens.Rose gardens and formal gardens are located at the top (up by Bridge Street and the Conservatory). With over 4000 trees in the Gardens, it provides plenty of shade to both the paths and steps down as you head to the foreshore enjoying the sea breeze and the views of the harbour around to Opera House and the Harbour Bridge. There is plenty of private nooks to picnic with your family and friends.It\u2019s a great spot to people watch and have a bite to eat from the busy hustle and bustle of city life. It\u2019s just another hot spot to add to your list of \u2018free stuff\u2019 to do with the family. Who said that everything costs money these days?"

Beautiful gardens but even better fanastic views of Sdyney, Harbour, Opera House & Bridge. Especially from Mrs. Macquaries point/Chair. Gardens are free.  The following information might help, if you want to cover all of the garden. We are active and healthy 68 year seniors who do a lot of walking. And the paved walkways are very nice. But a 74 acre Garden, with some inclines and some steps on a warm and hot day can be a little much. The Garden is divided into four parts, Lower Gardens, Middle Gardens, Palace Gardens and Bennelong precinct. And each of the gardens contains smaller individual gardens, rose, themed, etc. etc. with different features and large amounts of trees and lawn areas. Located in the middle of all the Gardens is Palm Grove Center which has a restaurant and a small cafe, garden shop, visitors center and restrooms. There are Free guided walks daily 10:30am starting from the Garden Shop and some other special interest tours as well. The cafe and restaurant at the Palm Grove Center Cafe serves sandwiches and the Restaurant serves more meals. TRAIN: - There is a small train \u201cChoochoo\\Express\u201d runs 10:30 to 4:30, Which starts and finishes at Queen Elizabeth II Gate, which is close to the Opera house. Trains room every hour and half hour. If you just want to ride though the gardens, the complete circle tour takes about 30 minutes. And/or you can hop on and off if you have a train ticket and reboard as well at any of the following four stops. 1. Tropical centre/rose garden.2. The Woolloomoolo Gate/ Art Gallery.3. The restaurant Cafe/garden shop and information center.4. Mrs. Macquaries point/chair.  THE ONLY PLACE you can buy tickets for the train is at the QUEEN ELIZABETH II GATE, the entrance by the Opera House area. Tickets are not sold any other place in the park and you must have a ticket in hand. We entered the garden though the Art Gallery entrance. But If we had known about the train etc etc. We would have taken it. Not sure but think train ticket cost $10.00 per person."

We spent about two hours in the gardens, but if you're a real plant lover you'll want more time."

It is right next to the Intercontinental hotel where we stay, and it is surrounded by many attractions, most of which are free. You can spend a week in the area and see lots of wonderful things, from nature and wildlife to cultural exhibitions that focus on Aboriginal culture. The park has all sorts of vegetation, from rain forest walks to harbor view walks of the opera house and harbour bridge. It was the first place we went from our hotel after a long flight and arriving early in the morning. It helped keep us away, got some fresh air, and we were well on our way to dealing with our 14 hour time zone difference. Many of the local people enjoy the park, so it is a great place to immerse yourself in the local culture as well."

However this was the first time I had visited Sydney's gardens since I was a child. These gardens are so beautiful that I actually went twice in the week that we stayed in Sydney. I always find that there is a great sense of peace and tranquility in a garden and Sydney's is no exception. There is a path around the perimeter that leads to Mrs Macquarie's seat, where you can sit and have someone take the obligatory photograph! It's a lovely walk, and much more peaceful than the walk around Melbourne's gardens where you are likely to be mown down by joggers! There is a large variety of plants, many of which have information signs. There are statues here and there, Asian gardens in the middle: they are just gorgeous! There are lakes and ponds, places where you can get food and drinks (though we didn't). The rose garden is a particularly spectacular feature. There is a large gazebo set in the centre. It is surrounded by different beds of roses, all named. On one of our visits here, there was a wedding taking place. Truly a lovely setting for it, if you are that way inclined! I'd love to visit again in a different season to see the changes!"

The garden is fabulous, unfortunately we weren't able to spend as much time as we wanted here. So we saw just the small portion on the garden but it really impressed us. It's a great place for picnic, lunch or just meeting friends too, cause there are lots of grass areas where you can rest your foot and at the same time enjoy views to the water. All is totally free! We also walked to the Macquaeries chair and enjoyed views of the Opera and Harbour Bridge. Lots of people, but the place didn't feel owercrowded or to noisy. If you have more time, definitely pack your lunch bag and go here for a longer walk - so much to see!"

We did not want to leave and sat for a while on one of the many benches they have available and just enjoyed the wonderful weather and the faboulous views."

It's easy to get lost, and you feel like alice in wonderland with all the different plants and signs pointing everywhere. There are apots with a 'fairy hunt', I believe there was a cafe, there was a bamboo garden which you can climb amongst. It's fun for the kids.Wilife is everywhere, on the grass and next to the water spots. Little dainty bridges and paths make it all very fun for kids. I would recommend taking a picnic and choosing a spot somewhere. There are hundreds of areas. Be sure to clean up after yourselves though because your litter would be noticed from a mile off, as the area is clearly maintained well.Just go and be at peace. Or enjoy the walk."

It has lots of things to offer: beautiful and big flowering plants, trees and ferns; several entrances and accessibility, walking \"connections\" to the Rocks, Sydney Harbour and its attractions, and Opera House; lawns for picnics; benches to sit down to admire the views located inside and outside of the garden; fountains; statutes; rest rooms, etc. Best view ever - towards the end of my walk of the Garden, starting at the Mrs. McQuarie Street, I saw the best view ever - the Sydney Harbour Bridge and the Opera House. Excellent place for one's photo shoot!Tip: If you get tired walking, take the little train that goes around the Garden or just simply sit down at one of the benches."

The trunks of the various trees were like works of art, so many intricate details in the trunks alone. I have never considered myself a tree lover but I may feel differently now,  We saw the most beautiful birds too. The lorikeets were among my favorites. We also spied some amazing spiders with enormous webs . Although we didn't ride the little red train that ran through the park, it did look like fun.

There are fantastic photo opportunities, both within the gardens and of the harbour.Sadly we missed a cup of reviving tea in the cafe as it shut early for some reason, but another time a picnic would be a great idea. Around every corner was something interesting - a rain forest walk, a kookaburra, a rose arbour, a fern house, a cockatoo, a new view of the city. We managed the whole thing in an easy stroll without the need for the tourist train, but if you have trouble walking or get tired easily, that would be good too.Highly recommended.Take comfy shoes, refreshments and an empty memory card in your camera."

We've visited many botanical gardens in various countries...Greece, M\u00e9xico, Australia and the U.S. These gardens in Sydney are among the best we've seen, with lots of plant variety and clear interpretation signs (some signs are badly weathered and should be replaced). Free admission is a very appealing enticement to visit these excellent grounds. Although not part of the floral displays, we found an amazing interpretive series there, dealing with the aboriginal people of the Sydney area. After taking a leisurely stroll through the different sections of the gardens for about 90 minutes, including a stop in the excellent gift shop, I decided to ride the $10 \"Choo Choo Express\" trackless train while my wife explored other sections. The loop trip lasted about 25 minutes. Despite the scripted live narration by a personable young driver, it was a complete waste of time and money. Hardly any interpretive information was given, and that was for just a few of the thousands of plant specimens in the expansive gardens.Overall, we thoroughly enjoyed our half-day visit to the Royal Botanical Gardens, and can recommend it as a good way to spend time away from the hustle and bustle of the city of Sydney. Just don't bother to ride the trackless train. You'll learn more by walking around and reading the interpretive signs."

Indeed, after 5 minutes of hearing about buildings, my husband queried when we might hear anything about the gardens themselves!

The trees therein are amazing and the Gardens are beautifully kept.there are good facilities too and entry is free,always a bonus! We had a nice lunch in the cafeteria on our first visit,but were disappointed on our second visit to arrive at the cafeteria gasping for a cup of tea at 3.50 pm only to find the place closes at 4pm. and we were unable to have even a glass of tap water!! It would be good I feel that the cafe should stay open until 5pm,and certainly during the long lovely summer days."

The gardens, and the life within (birds especially), was wonderful. Lots of areas to explore and to experience. However, most frustrating is the signage used to provide direction. Many of the signs don't direct one to where they say one is going. As one of the gardeners said, most point as the crow flies, which isn't the direction taken by the paths. Anyway, the best thing to do is to wander through the garden and see where it takes you -- going with a plan is frustrating and disrupts the calm."

We didn't see that many different flowers and trees from all over the world at one place yet. You can come here to learn about the different species, you can come here to have a nice pic-nic, come here to do your yoga .. you can do everything in this wonderful area.All the detailed work by building the different areas like the roses, the orchid, the oriental area ...And everything without any entrance fee.If you reach the back of the gardens you can probably take the best photo of Sydney with Opera House and Harbour Bridge in one picture."

We wanted to find the ideal spot to watch the New Year's Eve fireworks and after lots of research we found just that!The Royal botanic Gardens have three areas to watch the fireworks from.Two are over 18 events and one,lawn with the view is a triangular area of grass on a slight hill.Tickets where \u00a3140 each (no consesions for children) and worth every penny. We registered our interest on the Botanical gardens web site in March last year and in doing so had access to tickets 2 days before they went on general sale. Thank goodness we did as it was an instant sell out. We qued for 40 mins at the enterance to the park before the gates opend and it was very orderly. You were provided with a hamper on entering the park which contained enough delicious food to feed two let alone one person and a bottle of water. You could pruchace alcohol from the tent inside.The views were amazing we overlooked the opera house and had a clear view of the bridge. It was so close you felt you could reach out and touch it. Because the area was sloped everybody stayed seated on their picnic blanket and everyone had an equally good view. As you can imagine the atmosphere was electric.Anybody that saw the 2015 fireworks on TV will know that they were spectacular. There was an added bonus that at 9 PM they have what they call the family fireworks which is another huge display lasting 20 minutes for people that do not want to stay until midnight.There were plenty of portaloos which were constantly cleaned and the stewards did a marvellous job of making sure everybody had a great time.After the event the way that the police and stewards guided the crowds to bus/trains etc was impressive. There was no charge on transport and as one bus was full another replaced it. By 1am you would never have guessed that there had been millions of people in the city.We all can't such a wonderful time. It was a night but none of us will ever forget"

Ten Chinese brides were being married in a group ceremony. Runners were using the gorgeous old, wide sandstone steps to train. The Festival of Sydney had it's open air screen and seating all set for the evening's event. People were picnicking in the shade or lying in the sun.

I would appreciate more bathrooms as my son peed his pants due to the bathrooms being spread so far apart. There was a nice Japanese garden that the kids loved as they coukd rake in the zen garden. The walk took us right around to the Opera House. Finding the way we came in was hard so we couldn't go out the same way. We dropped in to Government House while we were there which was free.

There are lots of yachts and boats, helicopters and old planes everywhere at this point, so if you enjoy watching other people enjoy, try this place.

You are encouraged to take a picnic with you for before or after. The actors are from the Shakespeare company and it was just captivating. The animals are wonderfully presented with amazing costumes. You can hear well and there are lots of jokes too.This year I took our 4 grandchildren and about 20 years or so ago I took my three children who still remember how good it was. You can book (www.shakespeareaustralia.com.au) and tickets are for sale at the pond. Cost this year was $25 or family of 4 $90. There also seemed to be a few adults there with no children!"

The varity of plants are amazing; and the most importantly you do not see as many people as other places around inside the gardens, I really don't know why."

A wander around the gardens is a great way to introduce yourself to the plants of Australia. From desert plants to rainforest, this has it all, and some of the specimens are older than the visitors. The sad part of my latest visit was the notice that several very old trees were dying and they were to be removed soon. At least the notice beside the trees gave an opportunity to say goodbye. Meanwhile the colourful flowers throughout the gardens provided a happy scene and the birds, spiders and reptiles living amongst the vegetation added to the Australian experience. To top it off the shop has an excellent array of botanical books and gifts while the caf\u00e9 with its friendly staff do a good coffee."

            "review": "NYE Under the Stars Dec 2014 at Botanic Gardens. Firstly, let me say that if you can afford a ticket to an exclusive viewing area for the fireworks, BUY ONE. Read as many reviews as possible about the different events offered at the Botanic Gardens (NYE Under the Stars, Midnight at the Oasis, Lawn With a View, The Point) and decide which one suites your needs best. I chose NYE under the stars and I'm very pleased with my selection. If you can not afford a ticket, and plan to get a great vantage point on the free viewing areas, be prepared to be in line/queue as early as 7 am even though the gates don't open until 10 am. This is if you want an unobstructed view free of trees. Prepare for hot weather during the day, possible rain, and very cool weather at night. Be prepared to use portable toilets that will get more and more filthy as the day wears on. Be prepared for extreme crowds that may get rather rowdy. Pack smartly for a LONG day outdoors in the elements. I researched my options thoroughly and finally decided on NYE Under the Stars because the tickets to all other venues were sold out. Search The Royal Botanic Gardens & Domain Trust and www.sydneynewyearseve.com for official events. My experience: I only queued for two hours. (This was by choice because I wanted to make sure I got a good spot on Tarpeian Precinct North to view the fireworks. The gates opened at 6:30 and my friend and I chose to wait at the gate for 2 hours. There were ~ 30 people ahead of us and about a hundred people behind us. Coming early paid off because we were front and center on the lawn once the gates opened). We very well could have arrived at 7 pm or later and still got a great spot for viewing. Honestly, no spot was a bad spot for VIEWING, but the farther back you are on the lawn, the more likely you'll be in the high traffic areas with people passing over you to get to the food/drink stands and toilets. Having people stepping over you all night has to be annoying!All inclusive food and drinks were included in our package. The food and drinks were good and plentiful, but lines were long earlier in the night and tapered off as the night went on. There were servers who circled the lawn delivering food/water, but they typically ran out of food before they reached patrons at the front of the lawn since they entered from the back.They were bathroom attendants who directed traffic which was extremely helpful! As the night went on, the bathroom line was longer than the food & drink line. The viewing area was SPECTACULAR and worth every penny!! It cost $395 AUD. The lawn could accommodate ~1500 patrons. The lawn is large and there is no bad area for VIEWING, but there is a large tree that can obscure views. I would suggest the following improvements for next year:1) there needs to be several CLEAR walking paths where sitting is PROHIBITED. Once the lawn got crowded, it was nearly impossible to walk around to get food/drinks or get to the bathroomIt would be great if these walking paths could be illuminated by outdoor bulbs2) there needs to be consistent rules as it relates to chairs being allowed. I enjoyed sitting on my beach towel, but a beach chair would have been more comfortable. I was envious of those who had small chairs. 3) the DJ may not be needed. There's so many parties in close proximity that it seems to be a distraction I loved that standing was not allowed during the fireworks. I hope this rule remains. Overall, I think this event and vantage point was worth EVERY dollar spent! If I'm ever in Sydney again, I wouldn't hesitate to attend again. But I would definitely arrive 2 hours early and wait for the gates to open."

I actually only ended up seeing only a small part of the gardens.I had read on their website that there was a free daily tour of the gardens at 10:30am and decided to do this. The tour was very informative and was actually very like a lesson. We looked at a few different trees and plants and learnt about their history and how they grow. It was very interesting but as I said we only saw a tiny bit of the garden. There was not a lot of walking around the garden so you didn't see as much of it.The tour was very good, just not what I had been expecting. For me I would have preferred to have walked around the garden more instead of examining a small area in such great detail."

If you near the Circular Quay or visiting the Opera House, the Botanic Gardens and the domain is a great way to spend part of the day. Even if all you do is walk or jog the shore path from the Opera House to Mrs. Macqaurie's Chair it is worth it. The walk is about 3/4 mile each way with some of the best across the bay views of the Opera House and Bridge with Sydney as the background. On the opposite side is the Botanic gardens, an expanse of green lawns, huge variety of trees, plants and gardens throughout. I would recommend going to the \"chair\" either early in the day or late in the day, to avoid the \"sea of tourist buses\" getting there. You can take a bus or taxi there as well.We visited the gardens on the first day we arrived (noon), checked in, rested a bit and toured the gardens. Our hotel was right across the street so we started there, had coffee and a snack at the Garden restaurant, then to Mrs Macquarie's chair, took a lot of pictures and headed back along the shore path to the opera house, visited the opera house, had a light dinner at one of the cafes along the Quay and headed back to the hotel. You could go the opposite way and head into the city exiting the Government house or palace garden gates.For us it was great way to spend the first day, keeping us awake but not too demanding, just taking in the scenery. After spending 25+ hours on a plane, this was a great way to take our time, stretch the muscles and causally enjoy Sydney. It was a great start to a wonderful holiday."

Each year the Botanic Gardens in Sydney close down in order to host a set of New Year's Eve events that facilitate the viewing of the incredible Fireworks display put on by the city of Sydney, Australia. As an American, I have only observed what is shown on national news clips which usually feature about 20 seconds of content (the 10 second countdown and about 10 seconds more of initial fireworks.) While this is exciting, it was nothing compared to the actual fireworks display that finishes up the midnight sequence. The last two minutes of the show are unlike anything I have ever experienced. It was phenomenal and worth every penny of the pricey tickets needed to get into this event. I will say you can experience the fireworks in a far less pleasurable, but much cheaper way on the public street, but after spending a great deal of money to travel thousands of miles, I wanted a more secure spot where I knew I would be able to savor this moment, and I have no regrets about doing so. The event we went to provided a substantial basket dinner which was innovative in concept although not as delicious in execution as I had hoped, and each patron must provide a \"rug\" (translation for Americans=blanket) to sit on the lawn, so if you find it difficult to sit on the ground for five hours, you might want to spring for the even more expensive tickets which offer a table and chairs. But overall, this was (by far) the best thing we did while in Sydney and will remain an amazing memory to hold on to for the rest of my years."

The selection of flora is fantastic, with sections dedicated to certain world regions. There are ornamental lakes with some big eels in residence and bird life to look at as well. The views over the harbour and the Sydney Opera House are wonderful from the gardens. Definitely worth visiting next time you are in Sydney."

It is usually hard to convince my husband to go to gardens with me since he tends to not be impressed with flowers but he was easily sold within minutes. The best part of the park is that you are able to see the bridge and opera house at several different spots. Its perfect for some good pictures of the skyline."

The hotel that I booked was right across the street from the garden, so we had easy access. The first day, my husband and I just walked around the park, exploring and trying to get our bearings for it is an extremely large area. It is close to the Sydney Opera House. I knew that I wanted to return the next day for a guided tour and I was trying to figure out the best way to get to the designated meeting area.The following day, I went by myself to the Garden Shop at Palm Grove Center. I met our guide, Glen. There were about 7 of us in the group. Glen was a volunteer who was very knowledgeable and passionate about the garden. He certainly knew his material. Not only did he talk about the plants, he also talked about the history of Sydney and Australia. He pointed out some of the brick work that had been done by convicts. When it was time for the hour and a half walk to be over, he asked if we would like to continue. All of us were eager to do so.Because their seasons are the opposite of ours in the U.S., we were there for the Spring Walk. It was absolutely magnificent! The Spring Walk is a tradition in Sydney that has been going on for many years.I would advise everyone who visits Sydney to visit the Royal Botanic Gardens and, if they have the time, to go on at least one of the guided tours."

Note this is a review of the NYE Midnight at the Oasis event, not the Royal Botanical Gardens themselves.As we were coming to Australia, and to Sydney, for the first time and were here for NYE, we wanted to do something special and didn't want to have to queue all day. After much research we chose MatO as it had the best views. And we were right to do so. The views were amazing. We had a direct view of the opera house and the bridge from our table and were sat with some really nice people, so all in all we had a great evening. But...On the website it said because it was a ticketed event and doors didn't open until 7pm, there was no need for us to turn up early. We foolishly followed this advice and turned up just after 7pm to find an enormous queue. We then stood in this queue for 45 minutes before we were admitted. We were given our starter box, which we took to the table. We admired the fabulous view for a few seconds and I then left to get some drinks. Another queue. There was, it seemed, one bar for the entire event and approximately 10 people serving. I queued for another 45 mins to get to the front, and when I was finally there I was told by the bar staff I could only order 1 bottle of wine (as there was only me in the queue, my boyfriend had stayed at the table to look after our things). I just wanted a bottle of wine and a bottle of champagne for me and my other half to see us through until midnight. I nearly cried at this point. Fortunately people around me came to my aid and I was able to buy what I wanted. I got back to the table and my boyfriend had to immediately leave to join the queue for the main courses. This took him away for approx 1/2 an hour. The desserts queue was much better and only took 10 mins, but between us we queued for over 2 hours, during which time we couldn't enjoy either the view, or each other's company. On NYE. At an event that cost AUS$385 (approx \u00a3200) per person. This event has been going on for years. I am appalled at their lack of organisation not to say a little angry. I cannot overstate how amazing the view was, and of course the fireworks, and I refused to let it spoil our evening. However if we are ever lucky enough to be in Sydney for NYE again, we will certainly not be going to this event. All I can say if you do decide to go is don't believe the advice on the website, turn up early. And if you turn up on time, be prepared to queue."

The organisers were so kind they even decanted the bottled wine into prepared bottle for these dumbo's, I would have kept it as compensation for dealing with ignorant morons. However the organisers still allowed the tents,chairs that had spike legs not curved , which was a shame, I would have loved a chair to be a bit more comfy over the 7 hrs, but silly me I followed the rules & requests. Even though it was self catered as stated in said paper work there was a coffee van which sold pies, sausage rolls, rolls with mixed fillings, chocolates.

It can be accessed at various points: the gate behind the opera House and the lovely foreshore walk; the main entrance at the top of the hill and a couple of minor entrances in the perimeter fencing.The garden is beautifully set out with various garden zones. The planting is luxurious but with really helpful plant labels. Paths are mostly sealed and easy pushing for buggies or wheelchairs. Some of the minor routes have a bark covering. There is an enormous amount of space. Seats are sited around the gardens in abundance. Guided walks leave regularly. The shop and visitor centre have lots of information. The garden is very well signposted so finding your way around is not too much of a challenge. The caf\u00e9 is well sited. There is a land train every half hour around the garden. The main stop for this is at the Opera House gate. The views from the garden over the Harbour and the opera House are stunning. Don't leave Sydney without enjoying this free attraction."

Such a vast array of plant species set in an incredible landscape that is Sydney Harbour, and only a short walk from the city. The gardens can be accessed from several different areas so it's worth getting a tourist map or check online to get your closest entrance. If you are a tourist to Sydney, make time to visit the gardens, but not just an hour as there is so much to see. Individual gardens contain a large amount of cacti from various countries, some of them huge, enormous Moreton Bay fig trees with large butruss roots that children love to play around. There are many varieties of palms and bamboo, sensory, rose and herb gardens, and a modern glass house with tropical plants - so much to see. There are also older glass house containing orchids and other species. A large colony of fruit bats resides within the central garden area that a lot of visitors would not have seen - they remind me of broken umbrellas hanging in the trees. There is a coffee shop and restaurant available within the gardens when you need a break. The Lion Gate Lodge occasionally has art exhibitions so it's worth checking at the information booth. Throughout the gardens you will get wonderful views of the harbour and city so ensure you take your camera. In the Garden House, an impressive sandstone building near the cacti garden you are able to buy souvenirs and books etc. Walking through the gardens will take you down to the harbour and on to the Opera House and Circular Quay, so if you are staying in the city you can make it a circular walk. All in all a great place to spend part of a morning or afternoon in Sydney."

You can forget that you are not in a forest or jungle as you stroll through this wonderful place. The only thing that gives away the fact that you are not in some lost world is the numerous name plaques of different species of plants and trees. Walking on through the gardens, you emerge at Mrs. Macquarie's Chair, a seat cut out of stone, looking out over the harbour with the Sydney Opera House on your left and the harbour stretching out to the right tantalising you to get on a Manly Ferry and explore what is 'down harbour'. At dusk, the enormous fruit bats emerge to come and gorge on the fruit of the Moreton Bay Fig Trees which are in abundance there. As the sun sets beyond the Harbour Bridge, you have completed a day and you can 'sigh' just as the land does at the end of every Australian day."

The Royal Botanical Gardens are open from sunrise to sunset, and if I was a Sydneysider I would be a frequent visitor: all times of day and seasons of the year.The native plant section on the north end, closest to Mrs. Macquarie's Chair, was the most interesting to me, since many of these plants are unlikely to be encountered north of the Equator.However the Aussies have taken some immigrant flora to heart, such as palm trees from Baja California, the spectacular jacaranda from Brazil (you can see more in Hyde Park and south of Darling Harbour, as well as a pair of fine ones bracketing Sydney Town Hall. Birders will have fun: shrill cockatoos, nose-to-the-grindstone ibises, and plenty of others.Keep a sharp eye out for the First People-style carved tree trunk, and the overturned dragon's blood tree. Actually, there's an almost limitless amount of flora that's worth keeping a sharp eye out for. No need to keep a sharp eye out for those pesky little flies: even if you don't, they'll find you!"

Given the amount of others that I also see running on their lunch breaks, the gardens would benefit from adding a few more water bubblers."

The botanical gardens is a must see if you are interested in exploring around the rocks, circular quay, opera house, etc as they are all relatively close. Assign about an hour to explore the gardens plus additional time for some of the other adjacent sites including the state library, government house and the art gallery. Some of the more memorable experiences was strolling through the herb garden, learning about the imported crops from the UK and laying in the grass more concerned about being bitten by an ant, near the big triangular looking pyramid structure Overall the gardens are beautiful.

You feel like you could be out of the city while walking through them. Such wonderful gardens right in the city, perfect for a sit down lunch or romantic stroll.Spring flowers were out when we were strolling through, so we spent a good couple of hours out and wondering through on our first visit. Truly lovely."

The Royal Botanic Garden, Sydney, is a place of natural beauty, where people come for peace, relaxation, education, and to learn more about plants and horticulture. The surrounding parkland of the Domain is a place for sport, entertainment and recreation.It is situated near Opera house and you can view both Opera House and Harbour Bridge from here. You can easily reach here by train,ferry or bus.I have been living in Sydney for last forty years but every time I get new thrill when I visit it. In my opinion it is one of the best sight in the world to explore, enjoy and experience. I was there yesterday and the garden is full of spring flowers of various colours.Families with young children were sitting and enjoying while joggers were on the foreshore sharing the space with walkers.Great place and FREE."

The grounds are immaculately clean and we'll kept with signs and information plaques on all species.The foot paths are all well signed so getting lost or confused as to one's direction is impossible.The only reason we didn't rate this a five star experience is that there were so many areas that were roped off and there was also quite a bit of construction going on. This caused some foot paths to be blocked off. There was also a stagnant pond near the Chinese Lions that was most unattractive.Well worth a walk through as you explore the harbour area."

My mom, sisters and I didn\u2019t have the botanical gardens as a \u201cmust do\u201d on our list of things to see in Sydney because we figured it wouldn\u2019t be the best time to go. With that being said, when we arrived at our hotel and found out it wasn\u2019t ready yet, we had to find something to do. The gardens were not far from our hotel and we figured we could walk through leisurely and for FREE. The gardens really are beautiful. It\u2019s too bad we were visiting in winter. I\u2019m sure they are gorgeous in spring/summer. There were some plants that were just starting to flower, which was nice to see. We enjoyed the oriental gardens and enjoyed being able to walk around at our own pace.There are many bathrooms around the gardens, which we also appreciated. There were cafes also open with outdoor seating despite the cool day. One thing I was disappointed in was the greenhouse that wasn\u2019t open. It would have been nice to see more flowering/tropical plants.The gardens really are centrally located. You can easily walk to the Sydney opera house and along the river. I would recommend going!"

Overlooking one of the prettiest harbors in the world, flanked by the Sydney Opera House at the bottom and the Arts Gallery of New South Wales at the top, this park is worth the trip just to savor nature at its best, all within a short stroll from the hustle and bustle of the heart of Sydney CBD. The garden is large (about 30 hectares) and diverse enough to appeal to all ages and interests, be it a simple jog through the well maintained pathways, have a family picnic on the beautiful lawns or explore the rich world of plants. In additional to the wide varieties of plants in general, there are a number of special sections, for example on herbs, tropical and succulent plants and palms. There is plenty of literature to guide potential visitors to the highlights and features of this magnificent and significant piece of greenery, and depending on the interest and available time it would be easy to work out a suitable itinerary, be it a short trip or a daylong outing- all free too."

The train to Circular Quay gave us a short walk to the gardens and wonderful views along the way of the harbour life which is always interesting, as well of the dominating structure of the famous harbour bridge.From the station walk east past the ferry terminals and you will see a lift to the garden level. Alternatively you can take the longer route past the Opera House.The gardens are timeless and always new discoveries to be made. Take your picnic and enjoy the relaxing atmosphere with camera at hand, or purchase your needs at the caf\u00e9 in the centre of the grounds. Allow time to walk along Lady Macquarie's Chair. For your return you can consider the alternative transport of bus or taxi from the top gate. Allow at least half a day."

They are so peaceful, and beautiful. You really do not even go out of your way - these fabulous Gardens are literally in between the Opera House and the Fleet Steps / Mrs. Macquaries chair. One of my favorite Sydney photos is of the Ballerina statue at sunrise, if you take the photo looking towards the Harbour, the sun peaks through the trees with an orange glow and the ballerina looks like she is smiling towards it. Stunning. It's a garden of many interesting trees and plants (I visited in winter). Check out the Wishing Tree, make a wish, and learn where the phrase \"touch wood\" came from. See the tree blown on its side from the strong Harbour winds. Check out the terrific views of the Opera House with the Harbour bridge right behind it, from over near the Fleet Steps. It's just beautiful here, with benches all around for taking it in. A highlight for me in Sydney."

Sydney's Royal Botanic Gardens is a must for all international and interstate visitors, and for Sydney residents as well.First, it is located near most of the most attractive icons of Sydney such as the Opera House, the Harbour Bridge, the Rocks, etc. Thus, it is convenient to walk to the Gardens when you are visiting Sydney's Opera House.Second, it is accessible by a variety of public transport such as buses and subways. If you get there by car, you can find metered parking at reasonably low costs.Third, the Gardens are very attractive in their own right. There are a variety of plants, trees, shrubs, and flowers from all over the world, including native ones. In fact, there is nothing more enjoyable than walking in the Gardens on a sunny afternoon, regardless of the season. Inside the Gardens, you can take photos with the beautiful Opera House in the background. This will serve as a nice reminder of your trip to Sydney.To us, the most enjoyable thing is the opportunity to feed birds including rainbow lorikeets and cockatoos. If you plan to do this, come with some mixed bird seeds although the cockatoos' favourite foo id sunflower seeds. You need to come to the right spot and If you are patient enough, the birds will come for sure.Importantly, there are no fees whatsoever to enter the Gardens.In short, if you are visiting Sydney, especially for the first time, please include its Royal Botanic Gardens in your itinerary."

Relaxing ambience among an exquisit selection of well kept flora some of which was plant possibly up to 200 years ago. Most plants are labelled. There are places to sit, lie down and relax or even a venue to jog and get fit."

We entered the gardens by Opera House and were amazed at the collection of flowers, shrubs and trees.It was wintertime yet still colourful flowers to be seen and each plant/tree was labelled and some information given so you were not thinking 'what was that?'. There are free maps of the gardens with clear routes around the main attractions but it is too easy to be distracted and amble elsewhere, as we did a lot! Even for those not keen on gardens it is hard to dislike this place as it has hidden statues, artwork and great views and photo opportunities of the Sydney skyline. It is also not far from Mrs Macquaries Chair which is worth a visit!A highlight was feeding wild lorikeets and cockatoos which make the gardens their home! Also look up high in the trees, you might see flying foxes sleeping!"

This is a huge garden, so it is sort of impossible to walk the whole thing, so we took the train that takes you around the garden. You can get off and on when every you wish. They stop at all the main points. There are very few places to grab a drink or meal. There is very limited choice however. I would suggest you buy food before entering the gardens and you can have them while enjoying the views. The gardens provides probably the best view of Sydney harbour. We had a good half a day in the gardens. It is best to visit in the evening as it can get very hot and sunny during summer mornings."

If you want to get cerebral , you can study-up on the botanical names, of some of our most loved and iconic trees and aussie flora, via the well maintained signage all over the park.See the Opera House and the Harbour, from a totally different angle.Villa Borghese and Hyde Park are all very nice in their way, with a sense of history that is unmatched, but on a warm, summer day in the city , nothing can put you more in-touch, more quickly, with the notion of what it's like living in Australia, than an a few hours spent exploring this living gem."

Sydney's Botanic Gardens has many precincts and any moods: It has its waterfront which buzzes with people perambulating, jogging and enjoying the views of the harbour. It has large open grassy areas with duck ponds and nearby kiosk where families love to picnic. There is a glass pyramid for plants requiring a specially humid environment. There is a jungle area to get lost in. I love the First Settlement Garden, complete with scarecrows, which has attempted to replicate the plants which were grown at that time. The Museum is worth a visit. Nearby you can purchase plants instead of surreptitiously taking cuttings from plants on your way around. It is from here that you can join tours of the gardens, also worth considering. Near to the Museum is the walled Succulent Garden, which is locked up at night. I love this precinct and over the years have watched it grow to maturity. The Succulent Garden was my destination on this day when I slipped into the gardens while I was on a visit to the nearby Art Gallery of NSW. Some sculptures have been added more recently which provide an interesting counterpoint to the myriad of cacti to be found there. In my mind succulents remind me of undersea plants which seem to have to solve the same challenges as cacti: how to retain moisture and withstand a high salt environment. I love the structure of succulents. In a way they look almost like alien creatures lost on a distant world. This part of the garden has now created its own ambiance, and when you enter this gated garden you feel as though you could be slipping into another dimension. It seems so far removed from anything else in this temperate zone in which Sydney sits. Photo opportunities here are surreal."

It's a completely free and huge public park, complete with rose gardens, gazebos, an orchid greenhouse, as well as several additional greenhouses for specific plant genuses. The park is also home to giant flocks of cockatoos, and a couple thousand flying foxes. Look up into the treetops as you walk through the park and you'll see them hanging, waiting for dusk. If you are near the park at dusk, stick around for a few minutes and watch the bats depart, off to find food. Watching the swarm fly overhead is pretty amazing. I have to caution against feeding any of the birds, though. You'll think it's fun and endearing until a few hundred cockatoos surround you (several of which will land on you) demanding food for themselves. I saw many tourists get mobbed, and it wasn't pretty. You've been warned."

What a wonderful position with views of the harbour and Opera House! The gardens are beautifully maintained and full of interesting exotic and native plants, many with labels and information signs. It includes the site of the first farm in Australia made by the \"First Fleet\" in 1788. It's worth looking for the spot near a little bridge over the creek. The kiosk wasn't great (only place to buy food) but I think there are renovations taking place there and the pyramid grreenhouse for exotic tropical plants is being rebuilt. I recommend the Botanic gardens to visitors to our city and aso to residents looking for a pleasant walk or picnic."

I've worked in the Sydney CBD for over 20 years and for the last 15 years located in building directly across from the main entrance to the Gardens. I visit the Gardens at least twice a week, all year round. Here are four suggestions on how to enjoy the Gardens: (A) Walk from the Opera House around to Lady Macquarie's Chair. For the return walk, choose a random side path up into the Gardens, checkout all of the unusual plants and try to find some random quiet spot. Nice!(B) Walk on the grass. There's lots of grass, an unlike parks in other countries, you can walk on it all. Or sunbake. All with a view of the harbour. Relax!(C) Have breaky or lunch at the Palace Gate Cafe. This little gem is located on Macquarie Street just outside the Palace Gate entrance near the rose garden. It's cash only, very inexpensive but good value, great owner (open daily weekdays 8 am-5 pm and Saturdays 9.30 am-4.30 pm, closed Sundays). You have to like 'rustic' to enjoy the cafe. Yum!(D) Go running. This is how most of the locals enjoy the Gardens. You can choose any path you like, and also try sections of the Domain (a park located East of the Gardens - just as scenic though!). Help to work off that yummy cafe meal!"

We went up for the Tomato Expo, and the highlight was Costas joining us when we had our lunch (home-made sandwiches) . My friend used to own a garden nursery, and when visitors to the gardens realised she knew the plants, our progress was slow but we met some great people. When we got tired we had a cup of excellent coffee at the cafe, we sat outside and watched birds playing in a little water run- off. Then home. A long day but memorable."

My daughter held her wedding reception here following her wedding in the gardens last October.From the first contact with their wedding planner to the last of the actual evening, the staff were considerate and helpful with all our needs.The food tasting was a definite highlight and enabled tasting of the whole range of courses available so that we could make our selection.The actual menu was a great success with our guests (including the vegetarian options that were needed).The service on the evening was excellent.I would definitely recommend the venue for a wedding reception. The view of the gardens through the open verandah was beautiful and relaxed and just the atmosphere that my dughter was looking for.Having the whole gardens to ourselves at night was magical. We were lucky enough to have booked on a night when there were fireworks in the harbour and the wedding party went down to the harbour's edge to see them with the best view in Sydney all to themselves-very special.A few things to think of though.Getting out of the gardens at night you must leave by only one gate near Mrs Macquarie's Chair end which can be quite a walk for elderly or disabled guests (the restaurant arranged for the security golf cart for those that needed it but depending on numbers can be a bit of a wait). There are few taxis availble late at night. Parking is limited at the exit area although you can purchase parking at a reduced price from the normal meter price from the restaurant in advance. The Domain parking is closest and you may want to send the driver on ahead to collect the car and drive back to the gate to pick the passengers up.Guests may need some refreshments after the ceremony if there is a gap between the actual ceremony and when the restaurant opens for the evening especially if the weather is warm. There are companies that service this for weddings in the gardens.I would certainly recommend this venue for those seeking a smaller (we had about 85) wedding reception, (but they can do larger numbers and also cocktail menus for large groups)-fine also if there are children- that still retains an intimate garden atmosphere in a modern setting with a beautiful, stunning environment as a major bonus.We also had a meal at the resturant during its normal opening hours as a trial prior to selecting it and we were equally impressed then."

We had visited the Botanical Gardens on our previous trip and had been really impressed so, this time, we decided to take a free guided walk. These are provided by volunteers and start at the Information booth outside the Garden shop at the Palm Grove Centre at 10.30 am everyday or 1.00pm weekdays (The Palm Grove Centre is well signposted in the garden). You don't need to book. Just turn up before the start time. We did the morning walk, which was supposed to last 90 minutes. But our guide was so interesting and enthusiastic and had so much to tell us about the plants and trees and the role the site had played in the development of Sydney that we were with him for over 2 hours and had never ventured more than 200 yards from our starting point. This was a great introduction for a European to the flora of Australia and the problems which faced the earliest colonists and is a ideal for anyone who would like to understand the unique Australian landscape."

Originally used by Governors Phillip and Macquarie as a private reserve, it was planted as a botanical garden beginning in 1817. By 1831 all of the roads and paths have been constructed to allow public access. This large space, comparable with New York Central Park, hosts a rose garden, rain forest walk and palm grove. I first traveled out to Macquaries Point to get some of the pictures of the Opera House and Bridge .I walked the entire length of this park, marveling at the details. There are vast open spaces that are used by families for picnics, etc. While walking the rain that threatened began to fall. I found a small bench in a grove of palms and trees \u2013 incredibly trees \u2013 and waited out the rain in the blissful sound of lightly falling rain. An incredibly relaxing area to stretch your legs (especially after a very long flight) and to see how nature and usefulness can be coordinated."

They promote you being on the grass, so this would be a perfect spot to camp out if you need a rest. Bring a packed lunch, or toys for the kids! I was lucky to have gone there on a day where they had a tent with local art for sale, and got a great painting of an Australian beach. If you walk all the way over to the far side of the Gardens, away from the harbour, you can get a good view of the Opera House and the Bridge together. I went when it was late afternoon, so I could not get a good picture due to the sun gleaming in my eyes and in the camera, but i you go before noon I'd suspect you'd get a great shot!"

The admission is free, the weather is usually amazing, and the views are spectacular from virtually anywhere inside the Gardens. What more could you want?I walked from my hotel in Darling Harbour to the Circular Quay area of Sydney Harbour, which took around 30 minutes. However, the walk was very pleasant, and I got to stroll through the historic district of The Rocks enroute. When at Circular Quay, it is only a matter of minutes to the world famous Royal Botanic Gardens of Sydney. The gardens are as much noted for their views of the resplendent Opera House as they are for its flora and fauna.Aside from the omnipresent seagulls, I saw lots of cranes and cockatoos when I was walking through the gardens, although to my disappointment, I did not see any lorikeets. However, it was still enjoyable to see those wild birds in such lush foliage as we see here at these gardens in Sydney. It must be heaven for birds in this park, with so many trees on which to perch, and so many little nooks and crannies in which to hide from the tourists.Another thing that impressed me here was the use of life-size statues to add character to the gardens. Not one hundred paces went by without seeing another eerie statue staring at me. I took plenty of photos of each of them, and occasionally you would get a great big tree or tropical plant next to one, which works wonders for photography!Although I did nothing but walk around these amazing gardens, and admire the views from within and across to the Opera House, I hazard a guess that it must be a very nice to have a picnic here in the autumnal sunshine. There is a caf\u00e9 in the park, which gets very crowded throughout the day, but if I ever went back here I would pack myself a lunchbox and just sit around and people watch for an hour.

There's plenty of opportunity for food and drink and bathroom facilities. It's possible to mingle or be alone.

If you start at the Finger Wharf as we did, follow the water around Mrs Macguires walk to view the harbour, then around the next headland to the Opera House. This will give you a taste of the size of the gardens. We walked these gardens every day for five days and discovered more...an absolute treasure!"

There was an African music concert taking place and I assume there are many activities that occur in the area on weekends. Stoll to the point of the park and get a good look at the Sydney Opera House and the Sydney Harbour bridge from a different perspective. Also you will be able to see Fort Denison from the tip of the park. Enjoy"

Though these can be hot and humid.Grab some food at the restaurant in the middle of the park, it's a little pricey but top quality.If you prefer, the snack bar underneath has pies, sandwiches etc at reasonable take away prices.Depending on your interest, you can spend a couple of hours to a whole day at the gardens."

Its definitely must see place while you are in Sydney!"

However we had less than a couple of hours to wait before our tour of the Opera House so walked over to the Botanic gardens, so glad we did. We saw the Choo Choo train and as this trip only lasts 25mins booked two seats on the next train as best way of seeing the park hi-lights in a limited time. You can get on and off the train at four different pointd in the park, have a wonder around and jump back on the next train. Loads of unusual plants, trees and sculpture pointed out whilst on the train by the driver. Would have been great to have spent a half day here but time didn't allow, a relaxing spot in the busy city."

Our kids had a great time scampering around the boulders and paths as well as stopping to see some of the unusual plants. There was always another statue, pond, or flowerbed to see around each corner along the path. We walked out along the point to Mrs Macquaries Chair and enjoyed the great views of downtown Sydney, the Opera House, and the Harbour Bridge across the water.

            "review": "NYE's in Lawn with a View in the RBG. When we decided to spend NYE\u2019s in Sydney, we decided to look around and see if we actually need to pay to get into an event, or if we can just stay in one of the free vantage points. On further research, we learned that to get a good spot to view the fireworks, we would have to line up early on the 31st of December \u2013 and I mean as early as 9am. The advantage is that it\u2019s free \u2013 the disadvantage is more than 12hrs wasted on lining up and saving our spot, crowded public toilets, crowded spaces, etc, etc.So we decided that since we are just visiting Sydney for the NYE\u2019s celebrations, might as well make the most of it. We chose the Royal Botanic Gardens\u2019 (RBG) Lawn with a View Event for 2 reasons: It still had good views based on the photos, and it is the least expensive of the 3 events that RBG offers. We paid ~$250 each for the privilege of not having to line up early \u2013 we only went to the gate at 6.30pm and were there with plenty of time to spare before the gates opened. We managed to secure a good spot (sort of in the front, but with the view above the grills covering the harbor bridge. There seemed to be a sufficient amount of space for the number of people allowed in. Our only gripe is around 8pm \u2013 a large group of Brits decided to squish themselves on the small amount of space between our blanket and the next group\u2019s \u2013 if it was just 1 or 2 people, it would have been fine, but they were 6 or so. This drew the ire of the people around them, but they didn\u2019t care. They were very loud and drunk early on and didn\u2019t have any respect for the people who were there first. There were more than enough spaces further at the back which would have accommodated them. I think since we all paid a good amount of money, there should have been some intervention from the many staff in the area to prevent incidents like this.The entrance fee also includes a gourmet picnic dinner \u2013 which was quite good. It had a bottle of water, bread roll, bread sticks, dipping sauce, fruits, dessert, and roast chicken for the mains. One hamper of food was sufficient for two people. The other hamper ended up being partly eaten halfway through the night. There\u2019s a licensed bar inside the venue which sells alcoholic beverages for a reasonable price \u2013 1 bottle of sparkling wine was $38 \u2013 shared among 4 people, this wasn\u2019t so bad.There was live entertainment through the night care of two guys. This went on until about 9pm \u2013 before the first fireworks show, and until 11.30pm before the main fireworks.The view was quite good \u2013 we were very near the harbor bridge. However, because the Opera House was also right in front of us, we didn\u2019t manage to appreciate the scale of the fireworks encompassing the whole harbor bridge/opera house section. From the photos we saw afterwards, we now realize why Macquarie\u2019s chair is a popular spot, and why the other two events hosted by RBG near that area are more expensive.Overall, I would say this is a good event to go to if you want to have good views of the fireworks on the harbor bridge and if you want to save time in lining up and waiting for the fireworks. For another extra $50 or so though, I think the Midnight at the Oasis would have been a better value event as you can see both the opera house and the harbor bridge light up with fireworks."

A large number of the trees and flowers have details of their botanical names and there is a large rose garden which was in full bloom during my visit.Wild life abounds and the birds (I'm sure I heard a kookaburra...) have become use to people and relatively tame. There are quiet places but, with the city, harbour and small dockyard surrounding the gardens, it can be a little noisy in places but quieter corners do exist. Definitely worth a visit.

I saw many people laying in the grass, reading books or taking a stroll through the gardens. Several people were having picnics. I don't have much training in botany but it seemed to have lots of diversity in the gardens. Many species were labeled which was interesting.

The plants themselves are interesting enough and the grounds are well kept. There are all the appropriate water features and a few labels on plants as you would usually find, but these botanicals are a lot more park-like than those found elsewhere. There's lots of room for picnicking and there's lots of wildlife like cockatoos that will come down and join you. The views are also great, you get some different angles of the water and it always sparkles in the sunlight!It would have rated higher if the information and labeling was a little better - sometimes you could just not find out what a plant was - and if there were a few more garden display parts rather than parkland. I guess I should time my visit to one of the tours."

This park is definitely made for people to enjoy and the whole philosophy of the \"friends of the garden\" is that when people learn to appreciate and recognize plants, they will care for them and possibly grow their own. Their mission is accomplished because they have created a beautiful place to wander through and enjoy plants. There is a native plant section, a herb section, and an interesting area of succulents. Winding paths, well-situated benches and lots of shade trees make this a great place to spend a relaxing half day."

Not overwhelmingly large garden so easy to take it all in with plenty of opportunities to stop and rest as needed. Grab a brochure at the visitor center that provides a guide to the numerous birds. Incredible views of the bridge, opera house and downtown. And take a few extra minutes at the pool with the eels...they jump out of the water occasionally..crazy! Also, we had the burgers at the cafe in the gardens (the one underneath the pricey restaurant)...surprisingly good. Be warned if you sit at the tables outside the cafe to eat (we didn't)...the ibis' get aggressive and jump on the tables to get the food."

The domain and botanic gardens melt into each other creating huge green spaces. It is located very close to the opera house and easy transit by ferry, bus or car. We esp. like Mrs Mrs Macquaries {the wife of the New South Wales Governor} seat. It was a seat carved out of the natural rock where she used to sit and watch for ships coming from England. There is an aboriginal tour offered that shows you how the original natives used all the botanical plants for food and medicine-that was awesome to see and hear. Lovely spot for a few minutes, hours or a full day. Some of the trees are full of fruit bats who just hang out {upside down from the branches} during the day and then go out at sunset-truly a site to behold."

Take a banana or two and you will have new friends. The flying foxes are amazing, they hang upside down in the trees and when they fly around the shadow they cast is huge. There is a wide variety of trees, flowers and other greenery. If you are there on a weekend visit the Government House, it is the office of the provincial governor. They offer a short tour of the building and offices for free and share the history of the state and federal governments in Australia. Sydney is a busy city and the gardens offer a chance to relax and enjoy some amazing views. I recommend spending 3 to 4 hours for a relaxed visit."

One of these spots I went to was the gently sloping field where the small 'Stonehenge'-looking sculptures are. Here, you can take nice candid shots or casual group photos as well as have a short 5minute to sit & laze before continuing your walk. Other than that, there are also many animals scurrying or flying about. If you're lucky, you might get close-up shots of them as well. Best thing of all, it's free.Firstly, be sure to grab the photos of the white/yellow cockatoos in the garden. Secondly, be sure to find some great spots or sculptures where you can grab nice photos. Thirdly, go there at the end of winter/start of spring so that the temperature is cool & not warm, which may irritate you.Very good experience."

You could wander around this place for days on end and still now truly appreciate the depth and breadth that is captured here. For a great overview and to satiate the kid in you (or even better, if you have kids with you), take the Choo Choo Express. For $10 it stops in four key spots around the Gardens (we joined it at the Opera House stop); and, you can \"hop on hop off\" all you'd like for your ten bucks. What a deal! You'll get a good first look around and then you can decide how best to stroll the property. Don't miss the flower gardens in springtime -- so many beautiful tulips and flowering shrubs. Bring a frisbee (oops, a boomerang, perhaps!) and play on the many massive lawns. Pack a picnic lunch and blanket to enjoy the warm air and fresh green grass. Too hot? So many beautiful, gigantic shade trees you'll feel like you're on your own country estate.Great place for contemplation, a romantic walk, a serious talk or just fun with friends.

They are an easy walk from the CBD or the opera house, and much of the garden is wheelchair accessible. Take a picnic lunch and plan to spend a few hours. There are also cafes and restaurants, but why dine inside when the outside is so gorgeous?The Royal Botanic Gardens adjoin the 'Domain', which is additional greenspace that is well used by the people of Sydney for sport, family activities or just lazing about. A good way to start a visit to the gardens is to walk along the water's edge from the opera house, around Farm Cove and on through the Domain to Mrs Macquaire's Chair for magnificant views back to the opera house and harbour bridge ... followed by an icecream. Then return via one or more of the many paths that meander through the botanic gardens. If time permits, do as we did and then visit the art gallery of NSW at the south-east corner of the gardens, in the Domain."

I never miss a visit to the Botanic Gardens when in Sydney, whether its a whole afternoon simply rambling around the collection, or a quick stroll through between the Gallery and Circular Quay, the Botanic Gardens is where you can escape the city, but not the Harbour.The Harbourside Walk is to be recommended. Ditto perusal of the succulent and fig collections. You can even see a Wollemi Pine, a plant indigenous to the Blue Mountains that was only discovered in the 1980s. It dates back to the days of Gondwanna Land, when Australia and and South America where yet to set adrift and is amongst the most ancient of tree forms on earth.Try not to miss Lady Macquarrie's Chair on the Opera House side, or the impressive Botanic Garden Gates on the Gallery side. And drink in the greenery as well as the scenery!"

I've been to a few bontanical gardens in my day, but this one destroys them all--there are trees in this garden that are bigger than some whole botanical gardens. It's also old, I think it was founded in the late 1800s--so it has some huge old trees. There is so much variety--sometimes I had to stop and focus just trying to take in some of the individual species. My daughter did this really well. We came after a big rain storm so there was a fair amount of plant matter that had been knocked onto the ground. She collected pods and seeds and flowers that were fit for a fairy wedding. The gardens also attract a lot of birds--the air was filled w the flight (and screech) of cockatoos. We also saw what I think we're Ibis and some other waterfowl. At one point we looked over and saw a section of the garden swarmed by white butterflies. We walked over and read that this is the only known colony of this type of butterfly in NSW and it typically always lives within 20 meters of a certain pomegranate tree in the garden. The gardens flow down to the opera house. What more could you want in for an incredible day in Sydney."

Unlike the Botanical Gardens in New York that you must take a train to access, this is right in business district and has great views of the city and waterways as well.

And I would suggest bringing your lunch to eat in the parks. Just pack a sandwich, and sit on the lush green lawn (especially the ones facing the Opera House)...Perfect!"

Sydney Harbour is the central feature of Sydney and siting the Botanic Gardens with the Harbour forming one of the sides was total genius. The gardens are beautifully kept, but they encourage visitors to walk on the grass. What a change from the precious \"Keep Off the Grass\" signs we see in parks and gardens in Europe. The range of plants and shrubs is just too numerous to itemise. But we particularly loved the camellias, the massive Yuccas and what we call the Angels Trumpet tree in one of the smaller areas. Everywhere we looked there was colourful blooms, varied foliage and birds, lots and lots of birds. It was in the Botanics that we saw our biggest flock of white Cockatoos. (And we know, they are considered a pest species, but we loved how the underside of their wings are tinged with yellow to match their crest!) The views of the Opera House and the Sydney Harbour bridge are spectacular. It took our breath away to come up along a beautiful lawn and suddenly we could see both framed by a wonderful sky on top, the harbour to the right, the City of Sidney on the left, and lush green grass at the bottom. It's the perfect spot for a picnic or a relaxing lunch - or at least it is if you stay out of the way of the manic runners who crash through the garden focussed only on their own agenda. We found them aggressive and lacking in consideration and they certainly did not impress me. I just thought they were crazy not to be able to enjoy this beautiful place. When they've driven their joints to dysfunction, I hope they'll be able to take the time to just enjoy what they have all around them.The runners were a complete contradiction to the people we met in and around Sydney. They were charming, helpful and informative. And the same can be said for the staff in the Botanic Gardens. If you go to Sydney, make sure you take the time to walk around this beautiful place. And above all, enjoy the peace and beauty."

This year I came across an interesting planting of grasses showing popular lawn varieties! I know sounds thrilling! However it was interesting to see such variety and why some are used for different things. There are also gardens showing the impact of the first settlers and why their first crops failed. I visited three times over several days, spending an hour or so wandering different parts. I have been coming for almost twenty years and I doubt I will ever tire of the gardens."

My wife and I most recently visited this attraction in March and again in April 2013 as a cruiseship-walk before dinner...and before lunch\u2026and before drinks, although not necessarily in that order. In other words, this attraction is within easy walking distance of the ships, is free and is \u2026great! We particularly enjoy the sheer proximity to the city, with the contrast between the hustle of Circular Quay, The Opera House and the railway station being especially poignant on a balmy evening or early morning. The Sydney-siders are very blessed to have such a facility on their doorstep. The beauty of the gardens is amazing to be within a major world city within walking distance from the CBD and cruise terminal. Attractions abound, including fantastic trees and all indigenous plants, usually well labelled and identified. The gardens also host a great botanically themed gift-shop with sensibly priced souvenirs. There is also a Mini Train for those with difficulty walking, although you are more likely to see a procession of joggers, walkers, dedicated and seemingly under-nourished marathon runners than overfed cruise passengers (like us) who rarely seem to get that far\u2026go for it guys\u2026this is iconic Aussieland\u2026Good on yer mate!"

You have drop dead gorgeous views of Sydney Harbor from the park and there are great limestone (or similar) outcroppings that you can duck under if it happens to be raining.

You can spend a lot of time wandering around the extensive area, looking up to see the flying foxes, admiring the various plants or just sit down & people watch.I would recommend joining a free guided walk from the Garden Shop at 10.30 or 1pm Mon-Fri. Our guide was very informative & passionate about the flora & fauna. She showed the small group things we would never have spotted without her. Well worthwhile if you have the time. It takes about an hour."

In the heat of a Sydney summer this is the perfect place to unwind although don't be surprised to see a non-stop parade of runners and joggers along the water's edge whatever the time of day. Without a 'keep off the grass' in sight you're pretty much free to wander wherever you please which is great because there are plenty of hidden surprises tucked out of view. The sculpture trail (details in the gift shop) makes for an interesting distraction and if you've got the time to dwell a walk up to Mrs Mcquaries Chair and the less manicured Domain is definitely worthwhile for more photo opportunies.This side of the bay also has an open air cinema during the hotter months - we didn't have the time to go but it's worth asking your hotel for details of what's showing and booking ahead. Against a backdrop of the Harbour Bridge it would certainly be memorable."

My 7 yr old had a good time too, however for lack of time I was forced to leave earlier than I desired to. The small pond with lotuses by the cafe was an awesome stop to take in the beauty of nature. The roses were breath takingly beautiful. I highly recommend this place to all nature lovers visiting Sydney"

Its a one minute walk into the gardens from the Opera House. There is a hop on hop off train that kids love that gets you around if you are not up for walking. A lovely restaurant. Great picnic places. All smack in the middle of the city. Walk one way and you end up at the Art Gallery. Another and you end up at the Mitchell Library. Its a wonderful location full of beautiful native trees and flora."

Set right in the heart of the city, these gardens provide a sense of calm in this fast, hurried city. Gardens are very well maintained and neatly kept. Some of the varieties grown here are very rare and some are native to Australia. It was a delightful experience for me. I walked through the botanic gardens starting from Hyde Park and ended up with a beautiful view of Opera House. Long walk but very pleasant."

It has open lawns, fern walk through, cactus garden and trees of all sorts with information. There is a cafe and greenhouse area (significant charge) and on a sunny day has a real community feel. The art gallery of New South Wales is also in the gardens and worth a visit. Take a picnic, visit the art gallery and walk for a couple of hours to really unwind. Great."

The plants and trees to be found here, because of the climate, are very different from what one would find in most US and European cities, and that adds to the pleasure of this visit. These gardens are very well maintained, and there is no admission charge."

It does take at least half an hour, but it's totally worth it. Like with any Botanic Garden there's lots to see in terms of plants etc, but unlike others I've been too, there is more wildlife. Lots of spiders (harmless), a lot of birds including Parakeet's and Cockatoo's. I've also spotted a few Possum's in the evening.Best time to visit is dusk. Beautiful views over the Opera House and Harbour bridge. You also get a swarm of bats flying above the park (they roost in the trees at the gardens). The sky was thick large fruit bats, it was quite amazing too see, coming from the UK I'd not seen anything like it. You cannot go to Sydney without walking round the gardens.

The Ibis, quite large/tall, and their long curving beaks hoping you will give them some food! Great place to stretch your longs after a long haul flight. Make sure you walk around to Mrs MacQuaries point to get one of the most stunning photo opportunities of the Opera House and Harbour Bridge in the same shot. PS the gardens have free entrance."

The scent of the blooms hangs heavy in the warm air. There used to be hundreds of flying foxes hanging upside down in the trees but they are absent this year. They were an interesting sight but they smelt awful and I'm glad they've gone. The ibises are scavengers and pests but the rainbow lorikeets and the sulphur crested cockatoos that fly about there are glorious. There is a huge old Moreton's fig tree that is splendid. There are lotuses in the lake. The pathway along the lower gardens runs right along by the sea. Fresh salads, good sandwiches and hot food can be bought at the cafe by the shop. It's pricey but worth it for the ambience. I have spent hundreds of hours in these gardens and never tire of them. If you don't have a lot of time hop on the little red train for a tour with commentary. It leaves from the opera house gate."

Only a stone's throw from the Central Business District and behind the Opera House, the Royal Botanic Gardens make a pleasant break from the hustle and bustle of Sydney. Be prepared for a bit of a walk - the gardens are extensive and if you want to take it all in you will need a few hours. We'd recommend the morning as it is slightly cooler, plus you can stop at one of the pleasnt eateries within for lunch. The gardens are beautifully maintained and there is much to interest even a non-gardener like me! I found the Herb Garden very interesting and whilst the Rose Garden did not impress me at first it was only when I understood the difficulty in growing them here that its significance sank in. One of the things I really liked was the city skyline visible through the tress at certain points during the walk - so close by and yet so peaceful inside the gardens. Lots to see and do here, too numerous to mention. Give it a go!"

While in this area make sure you go to the central coffee shop and look up into the trees - you will see fruit bats (nocturnal) sleeping upside down and hanging from the trees. In summer as the sun sets thay migrate south and the image across the sky as they fly is amazing. The western edge (Macquarie St) has rose gardens and small hills. Northern edge fronts the harbour and has duck ponds. Bring a picnic to save money.

First off there is the complete lack of decent parking. The SBG website suggests street parking or covered parking at the hospital ajacent to the park but there are few available street spaces and the hospital charges $30 for one hour! We finally found another garage that charged $8 for an hour and $20 for 2 hours and more for more hours. Really a robbery!Then from the garage we walked about 2 K and finally entered the grounds. Nice layout and big trees but not much in the way of flowering gardens, even for October. There was more at the one in Melbourne and that was a month ago in early spring. So far we would rate the one at Geelong the best."

My favourite is one leading from the Gates in Macquarie Street, next to the Conservatorium of Music and ending up on the Finger Wharf in Wooloomooloo. If walking back, make sure you do it before 7pm as this is when the gates close."

The trees are so old that sometimes they lie down with their crowns in their arms. There are landscaped gardens with new plants and older areas with plants that predate the colony. This is a magical place for any time of the year. There are statues in the grounds and there are ducks on the pond. Come and see for youself why people love it."

The view is fantastic, take your pick either of the water or the opera house or the garden itself. Perfect. They are free to enter which I thought was amazing and great. We ate al fresco at the restaurant there, the food was good. Many photo opportunities. Interesting to see the the huge bats hanging on the trees and then all of a sudden we hear this caos up in the trees, we were there at the right time when the white wild cockatoos come to feed & rest and get on the same trees as the bats and kind of start shrieking and fighting for space on the trees. The bats leave to feed on insects while the cockatoos mingle with the people on the grounds. Amazing. Be careful & watch out as these lovely birds like to bite! Wear a hat that covers your ears as they will get on your head & might want to take a nibble. Loved and cherish this memory. Great experience."

I would recommend that you start from Circular Quay, heading towards the Sydney Opera House, where you can spend an hour or so touring it. Just five minutes' walk along the shore, you will reach the Royal Botanic Gardens, a lush and vast park where they invite you to walk on the grass. It is filled with many species of plants and herbs. Stop by the central lake where you can see birdlife as well as eels swimming along. Better yet, bring some food and wine and have a picnic. A lovely way to spend a spring morning."

The RBG was a good choice to spend a lazy afternoon as it is quiet and huge with a number of themed gardens showcasing their respective plant collections. Even though some of the outdoor plants were covered in nets (it was winter), it didn't ruin the experience one bit. Before you start your stroll in the park, pay a visit to the Art Gallery of NSW then walk your way into the gardens. Explore each seemingly wrong turn only to discover something beautiful. When you reach the other end, get a stunning view of the Sydney Opera House and the harbor. We chose one of the benches on the elevated ground and nicknamed it \"our spot.\" It was one of the best (and cheapest) dates we've ever had."

Very interesting flora and unlike many other gardens, the public is invited to walk on the lawns. A huge flying fox colony has been roosting in the central part of the gardens for years and has destroyed many heritage trees. As a result, a noise eviction programme was undertaken in June 2012 to disturb the flying foxes so they roost elsewhere. This eviction programme has proven successful to date. The Gardens are next to the Sydney Opera House and Mrs Macquaries Chair."

You can combine a visit with a visit to the Art Gallery or the Opera House.

Food in the cafeteria was good - choice of hot stuff and sandwiches, cakes and fruit salads, and not too pricey. My only peeve - they close the gates too early - it is still too light to take pictures, and one can't cut through the Gardens.

The Royal Botanic Gardens are at the northern end of Sydney CBD's green space & gardens, which begin with Hyde Park, run through the Domain and end at the harbour, beside the Opera House.It's an interesting area; the Cadigal people held initiation ceremonies near Mrs Macquarie's Chair, and there are many Aboriginal exhibits and displays in the Gardens today.Governor Phillilp wanted to farm the area to feed the fledgling colony in 1788, but the infertile soils couldn't support the fruits & vegetables, and in 1816 Governor Macquarie founded the Royal Botanic Gardens on the site. For 21 years from 1862, it housed our first Zoo. Today, it's a serene green oasis, home to native and imported species from all around the world. And the oldest scientific institution in Australia. Flowers in season provide colours, ducks & kids love the ponds and locals & visitors can be found walking, running & jogging along the paths in the early mornings & evenings. Or taking a more leisurely approach & lounging on the grass, picnicing or enjoying food from the cafe or amongst the tree tops in the restaurant.Few views can better watching boats on the harbour or the sun set behind the Opera House & Bridge from the gardens."

We therefore decided upon a serpentine route to reach the gallery, through each of the Gardens exemplar sections.

Budget at least half a day to walk through them and take it all in. The only specific pieces of advice I would give to anyone visiting are: allow enough time; if you're eating there, visit Botanic Garden Cafe in the centre of the garden and NOT Pavilion on the Park near the NSW Art Gallery, which we found overpriced and very sub-par; and if you're afraid of bats then be sure to find out in advance where the flying foxes live, as there are hundreds of them in certain sections.

They have free volunteer guided tours that run 1-2 times a day or maps for self-guided tours. For those who want an alternative, the Choo Choo express is a train that brings you all around the gardens, takes about 30 minutes and the driver gives commentary.Lots of beautiful plant life and interesting wildlife, mostly birds. We saw a family of ducks and cockatoos flying free. A word to the wise: be aware of the runners! They share the same paths but if you stick to one side, everyone will be happy.

The Aussie are a fit group and the park is always full of people running, kick boxing and doing yoga. Still not enough? Bring a ball or a Frisbee, or bring lunch and have a picnic. The RBG offers some of the best views of Sydney Harbour, you can even tour the Government house for a bit of history and it's all free."

We discovered that they are becoming a nuisance - their constant coming and going strips the leaves and buds off the trees and in fact is killing them, including magnificent 100 yr + trees. The Gardens are now using methods to discourage them and to get them to move elsewhere.

Mrs. Macquaries chair is interesting, but seems to be often swamped with bus tours. On my visit, there were about a hundred people up there and maybe fifty scattered through the rest of the Gardens.Good to make this part of a day worth of walking, as it's right next to the Opera House. I made it part of a loop from Hyde Park, up through the east side of the downtown area, through the Gardens, Opera House, down to the Circular Quay. From the Quay, you can hit anywhere in the Sydney area.Anyways, worth seeing for fans of flowers, bugs, birds, taking pictures and relaxing."

What a lovely, peaceful garden with a path that follows the harbour edge so the views of the Opera House and Bridge together are seen from Mrs. Macquaries Point. Also we got a peek at the outdoor stage the Opera is building.The trees, vegetation, birds and bats (flying foxes) were amazing. The trees were identified by placards. And there are many beautiful and interesting trees.There are multiple paths that can be taken. I would suggest going to their excellent website and printing out a map or two before you go so it is easier to find your way around, particularly if you come into the park from the north side near the Opera House. They offered guided walks which are free, that I wish we had had the time to take."

Usually I don't like going off to places without someone to share them with but I spent 4 hours here and it still wasn't enough time to enjoy the beauty of the place. Walk around, get lost and enjoy the beauty because every cornf you turn there is something new to surprise you. I have been to botanical gardens around the world and this is by far the best one. It has the most variety and it,s the most entertaining, make sure you get a map. And yes, totally pay the fee for the tropical gardens, it's completely worth it. You,ll need about 6 hours if you want to see the whole thing leisurely."

The Royal Botanic Gardens, situated on about 75 acres, is comprised of over 15 separate garden themes and terraces, including the Begonia Garden, Palace Rose Garden, Herb garden, the Rainforest Walk. If you have a nice day, plan to spend at least 3 hours here.If you start from the Bridge Street side entrance, you will eventually make your way to the Sydney Harbour and striking views of The Sydney Opera House, The Sydney Harbour Bridge, and The Rocks. If you go in the opposite direction of the Opera House, you will see tons of joggers, an outdoor movie theater, and eventually Mrs Macquaries' Bench. You have to have your picture taken on the bench!In addition to numerous birds, including Ibis, you will be wondering about those big things hanging from so many of the trees. These are fruit bats that can have a wingspan of one meter. Specifically, the bats are Grey Headed Flying Foxes. If the day is a hot one, these critters will flap their wings and you will see how really big they are. If you are lucky, as we were, you will see the \"foxes\" fly from one tree to another. They are big!Plan to end your time here by walking toward the OPERA HOUSE. As I said, this is a beautiful view and it gets better the closer you get to the Circular Quay (the area at the end of Sydney Harbour that is bordered by the The Rocks, Opera House, and Sydney Harbour terminal)."

This is a lush oasis in Sydney. Sydney has a large collection of green parks but this one is dedicated to horticulture. This is one of Sydney's free attractions.Time required - Leisurely walks with picture talking can be finished in an hour. Guided tours are free and available. Check the Botanical Garden website for current times. Terrain - Mostly there are gradual slopes on paved walkways. There are some steps near the harbor but no more than two storey. During a hot day there is comfortable shade to be found. There are plenty of places for a picnic. On sunny warm days you may see a wedding or two in progress on the green lawns.On some occasions in the summer there are movies by the harbor side. Services - Bathrooms are available. There is a restaurant for good dining with views of the garden. There also is a souvenir/Botanical Garden shop located in the center next to the restaurant. At the edges of the park are vendors with drinks, ice cream, and sandwiches.Do not discount a visit here in the winter as the green house is a great place to be during the colder days."

I definitely remember how beautiful they used to be with the magnificent Azalea displays and many more flowers and a lot less paving than the Gardens have now. The current ethos is to concentrate on a more drab display with a leaning towards spiky unfriendly bushes and palms. Still worth a visit to just lay on the grass and watch The Harbour. It's not quiet, though. Leaf-blowers and petrol carts are part of The Gardens' new ethos. It can be crowded, especially on weekends, but just sitting-back and observing the people is fun in itself."

As with every person going native, after a while you take certain things for granted and don't appreciate them as much as you should. That's how I always feel about the Royal Botanic Gardens, whenever my Mum comes over for a visit from Germany. She absolutely loves them, and usually goes several times, just to wander around between the beautiful trees and wide open spaces. As a tourist, Sydney can be a little stressful at times, so she takes a book with her, and when she's had enough of the city, she just sits herself under a tree and reads for a little while.And the gardens are gorgeous in their lazy display of everything that makes Sydney so special. They have a huge part of the waterfront, with gorgeous views of the Opera House and the Bridge (the last 5 minutes of the 3rd Matrix instalment was filmed there). You can see LOTS of flying foxes, HUGE native trees, some art and statues, but mainly lots of nice open space to kick back. I would definitely recommend to every tourist to take a couple of hours to explore!"

They are a well organized and have all the goodies of most BGs, without being particularly spectacular or unique. The slight downer is the people pressure, which is inevitable and expected. Enjoy early as much as you can. Watch out fot the bat haven .. You will hear them, just don't walk underneath them."

For animal lovers, there is plenty to see: ibis; cockatiels, flying foxes were spotted. Geological sites to see include Mrs. Macquarries' point (as well as her chair). Fishing along the walkway along Farm Cove was fun to watch and made me want to buy a fishing rod.All of this is available for no charge minutes from Sydney's CBD. A true gem."

The Government House gardens are open every day and are lovely, and you can have a good look at the magnificent old building itself while you're there. Views back to Sydney from this location are brilliant. I think there are guided tours inside the House on some days (weekends mainly) which would be good. I did one of these tours many years ago and it was very interesting, and again very reasonably priced, if not free as well. From the gardens you can walk out along the Harbour down to the Opera House for some absolutely spectacular views, with the Harbour Bridge as a backdrop to the Opera House.

There is parkland adjoining where you can lay down on soft grass in the shade and enjoy the surrounds. The harbour is very close which is another benefit. The gardens are an easy walk from inner city hotels, of from the Cross and Darlinghurst and train stations. The Opera House is nearby as well as are department stores, Hyde Park, The Rocks."

Clearly they reflect how well maintained this huge park is.

There was a beautiful viewpoint on the way with the Sydney Opera House and the Harbour Bridge. At Mrs Macquaries Point we could admire strange coastal (sand?)stone formations. And we got extremely tired on the way back as the path went up and down numerous times. I would recommend visiting the Sydney Tropical Centre with a glass Pyramid - it looks like the Louvre Pyramid filled with palm trees.To sum up, this trip encouraged us to visit the Royal Botanic Gardens again - in order to see the feature gardens in more detail!PS.

Whether you're just passing through on your way to somewhere else, or you've come there to admire the gardens and stroll around, there's a lot to see and enjoy.Among the many gardens are a palm grove, an herb garden, an aboriginal garden featuring native plants that were on the original garden site, a famous Wollemi pine, an Australian rockery, a succulent garden, a rose garden, and an indoor tropical greenhouse. Joggers and dog-walkers abound, and you'll see lots of cockatoos, parrots, kookaburra, and ibis casually wandering about. The \"flying fox\" bats are a breathtaking sight if you're not afraid of bats \u2014 they fill the trees by day and come out at dusk to hunt.In addition, there is a gift shop, a couple of restaurants and cafes, and lots of sculpture and art in various buildings around the site \u2014 I wish we had known more about what was there! Definitely print out a map from their website and highlight the areas you want to see, because the grounds are huge and you may miss a lot otherwise!"

I saw my very first Bat \u2013 there are a few trees in the garden that are full of them and of course at 2 in the afternoon they were all wrapped up in their wings and sleeping. These bats were called Grey-headed flying foxes. We walked over to the Pavilion Kiosk and had a light lunch then we stopped in the Palm Grove Centre for a little shopping but we did not purchase anything \u2013 we just found everything over priced. We walked for about 2 hours and we barely saw one quarter of the garden. We actually were getting tired from all the walking so we decided to head back to our hotel.

The gardens are vast, stretching from the Opera House to the Mint, and they're full of well-maintained trees, flowers, and shrubs, many of which you'll never see outside Australia. You'll also see wild animals that most people have never seen outside of zoos, such as cockatoos, ibises, and flying foxes.The gardens reminded me of Central Park in New York because of the many \"special locations\" within the gardens, such as a rose garden, an herb garden, countless fountains and statues, a collection of succulents from around the world, and an oriental garden with lily pond. Non-botanical locations within the gardens--which, incredibly, are free of charge--include Government House, the restored mansion of the colonial governor, and the Art Gallery of New South Wales.The gardens are open seven days a week during daylight hours. Once I discovered them, I made a point of strolling through them each day, even if I was ultimately headed elsewhere. The winding paths through the gardens are a delightful eastern route if you're walking from the Opera House or Circular Quay to Hyde Park or the Central Business District, for example. If you're in Sydney for even a brief one-day trip, the gardens should make your must-see list if you have any interest in plants, wild animals, or natural beauty."

I particularly liked the area where the early convicts had a garden that didn't grow anything (I could definitely relate to that, it's a bit like mine LOL!)....Sorry I'm regressing :) The bats were stinky, but sort of cute & I made sure I didn't stand under any trees, if you know what I mean.

When we were walking the gardens, however, you come to this path that leads through a mini-forest. As you come closer, you here this loud screech, squeaking which sounds like a pack of rabid birds....what is it I wondered? Bats...and not just your ordinary tiny american type bats, but giant fruit bats...Lol...there were hundreds if not thousands of them hanging from the trees. Not sure if this is just a fall season thingy, but good lord they were every where!! It was broad daylight and they are as active as ever. It was totally cool!!! If you are bat sensitive or odor sensitive, I suggest you stay away...haha...but for those of you that are fascinated with that kind of thing, it's awesome to behold.

We were not going to visit the Royal Botanic Gardens this time in Sydney because we've seen beautiful gardens around the world and were exhausted, having already walked for days around Sydney. But when someone told us about the bats and cockatoos, my kids wanted to go. Well, once in the jungle section, we looked really hard for the bats in the trees hoping we wouldn't miss them. We had no idea how big and plentiful they were - and impossible to miss. There were hundred hanging up in the trees around dusk. The only disappointment is that we didn't see any flying. Then, we made our way over to the cockatoos (after asking a docent where they were) and had quite a treat! Other tourists were feeding them Pringles and candy but we happened to have almonds which, we soon found out, they LOVE. After making the rounds with the nuts and getting our fill of photos, the birds actually starting chasing after my son when they saw he had a pocket full of almonds. It was like a scene from \"The Birds\" but my son, thankfully a fast runner, had a good time with it. If you go, please take a natural food that the birds can eat - not junk food."

Pros:+ Not your ordinary park: we were amazed to see so many Flying Foxes (bats) hanging from every tree - almost as normal as seeing birds! That's something you don't see at a regular park everyday!+ friendly parrots. we were shocked to see so many white parrots flying around too. We saw a group of kids and parents feeding them in the middle of a field.+ the park was clean, safe and well kept. + There was an outdoor theater which we regret not buying tickets for. A must-see if you can get tickets beforehand online - especially during summer nights. The seats are facing the bay with a screen propped up near the shore. + plenty of australian flowers and trees to see, so you are never bored. + great view of the bay and the city!+ Free - unless you want exclusive tours at their special green houses. CONS:- none! take out one hour of your time after dinner or lunch to stroll around the park - you'll definitely find something beautiful or interesting."

Lots of wide green areas, lots of flora species, BATS, birds, pond, views and cafe are there to make you relax and calm. (exclude bats! ;) )Also, the previous Government House was located there and you can have a indoor free tour. Besides, there is a small part for rare floras of the world.In almost all of the Sydney top attractions, you didin't see this landmark. But if you have a little time, I really advice to see this place.Enjoy your visit!Pejvak"

It has wild cockatoos that my family enjoy playing with. They will fly and land on your arms. You are not supposed to feed the birds but it is obvious that they have been hand fed by the visitors as they are very friendly. There is also bats flying from the garden towards the opera house at dusk that my family enjoy watching. Good place to relax. Great view from the 'Mrs Macquarie' point. Enjoy."

The larger iconic buildings of Sydney\u2019s skyline are easily seen from many places in the Gardens, but there is a sense of peace in the grounds that can only really be found by getting close to nature.

The garden boasts some of the biggest, most diverse trees and other plant life. You try to capture these on a camera, but it just doesn't do it justice. In the end, it's best to pack a picnic and spend an afternoon lounging around and enjoying the views, sounds, and smells (mostly good but a bit foul near to where the flying foxes are residing, but they should be gone soon as the city will be moving them in May). There are a variety of birds roaming around which include the ibis and white cockatoos, the noisiest of the bunch but quite fun to watch. Don't miss out on lovely sun sets, which present some of the best photo opportunities. You can spend either a couple of hours or a couple of days in these gardens; it all depends on how you structure your day. There's also a little red train people can take to tour the gardens, but I didn't bother since I like to take my time and see everything at a rather slow pace. This is a place that you can go to at any time as admission is free, so if your day in Sydney has even an hour gap, go and hang out."

We set out with the intention of visiting the Opera House, the Government House within the Botanic Gardens and the actual gardens without realising how long it would take. The Gardens are huge, so make sure you take water and even some snacks if you want to stop for a mini picnic. We set off after breakfast (maybe 9.30am)and lunch time had well and truly passed by the time we ate at 3pm.I was quite surprised by the strong exercise culture that Sydneysiders seem to have. I have never seen so many people jogging, stretching and doing other muscle related activities during the middle of a weekday. The Botanic Gardens seem to be more about being a space for public use than beautiful gardens, but I guess that's really nice too. Seeing Mrs MacArthurs chair and lazing in the grounds of Government House were my highlights."

It is definately the most beautiful urban park I have visited. There are hundreds of exotic trees and plants all with signs of information. Paradise for a botanic freak. The views of the Sydney skyline is amazing itself, along with the harbour and small lakes and benches in the park this is the place to relax in Sydney central business district. You could bring your own food and have a picnic under a tree or go to one of the cafes in the garden. The cafes are very expensive - I think I payed 6 AUD for a 0,33l istea. Be sure not to litter the park, you will be spoken to by an angry parkguard. Be sure to spot the flying foxes (bats). There are hundreds of them hanging in the trees. Also, look out for Sulphur-crested Cockatoos! These beautiful parrots will be all around you if you bring them some food - they love grapes but even bread is good. Fun! There are also smaller very colourful parrots that can eat from your hand. Coming from Norway were all the birds are grey I think this was the higlight of the RBG. There are also freshwater eales living in the lakes. Creepy but cool! This is the place to have a photoshoot so make sure you have your camera! Stay here for as long as you want. I spent hours! There is also guided tours if you'd like that!"

The tour lasts 90 minutes, but our guide was so enthusiastic she kept extending it (with all our permission). She was just so passionate she would say \"Oh, you really must see this,\" and off we'd go to something else. Since it was the middle of winter, I thought that the tour might be a little less than inspiring. I was wrong. We learned all about the fruit bats, eucalyptus, Australian bees, fig trees, the Wollemi pine tree discovery, cockatoos, paper bark trees, lorikeets, etc. The 90 minutes went by too quickly, and we had barely scratched the surface of what the gardens contain. Different tour guides give different tours. There are other tours scheduled as well, such as the Aboriginal Heritage tour, and there was a second tour scheduled that day due to the holidays, so check the website. The tours meet at the Palm Grove Centre, conveniently located next to the gift shop, which had some of the nicest souvenirs I found in Australia. I suspect this is a tour I could take again and again and always learn something new, so I'll definitely put it on my list of activities for the next time I'm in Sydney."

Even if parks aren't your thing this is a great place to see some views of the Opera House, Harbour Bridge, Harbour in general or to just relax and people watch. You can also use the walking route along the harbours edge to walk to Mrs MacQuaries Chair which is a popular tourist sight.The Gardens themselves aren't what you may expect. They are basically a park with just some nice plants in and some good views. The name makes it suggest some dedicated establishment like London's Kew Gardens but it's basically a national park with some great views. Having said that you really do need to explore them even if it's just as a place to escape the chaos that can occur in Sydney at busy times of the day.There are some nice plants and birds in there though for anybody that wants to see them.If that hasn't persuaded you - for any movie buffs out there this is where the closing scenes of Mission Impossible 2 were filmed (that scene near the Opera House with Tom Cruise and the girl).If that didn't work I don't know what to suggest - just visit them and you'll see what I mean.
