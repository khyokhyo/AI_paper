The gallery is so beautiful and the Water Lily's are so absolutely breath taking it is easy to overlook the fantastic collection of Impressionist art downstairs. I ran straight up the ramp to the Monet masterpieces, but my tip would be to start downstairs, then go up to the two galleries. We went for a re-visit and sat down with the Lily paintings. It was crowded, but there were moments when the crowds parted and you feel some alone time in both rooms. Monet was lucky he got to design how his masterpieces would be displayed and they look magnificent! Do not miss downstairs though. Talk about right time and place for getting into art dealing."

So if you have time, you can wander around the Tour Eiffel or Notre Dame or wherever. But if not, or you'd rather just enjoy the cruise, do the non-stop: personally, my preference. I've taken more visitors than I care to remember on this experience, and the joy never wanes."

Plus you get the river cruise!There's also a tour boat with commentary in a few languages, including English, regarding the major sites, history and bridges. Vedettes de Pont Neuf leaves from the tip of Ile de la Cite, and is open to the sky for great photography in clear weather. The boat goes from Notre Dame area down to the Eiffel Tower and back in about 45 minutes. The docking location is close enough to walk from St Germain area. If you time the cruise right, near sunset, you'll see the Eiffel Tower light up. If you want to go in style and have dinner along the way, there's the Bateaux-Mouches or Bateau Parisiens or Le Carife. You can research them online to find out about scheduling and pricing. These boats are usually covered and you're more protected from elements. Some have rooftop bars. I haven't done it yet, but it looks like a romantic thing to do for couples!"

Great photo opportunities of the Eiffel Tower, Notre Dame, and more. Please note that if you are doing the combo tour take a look at the times. We did the tour with a 2:00pm start for the Eiffel Tower, by the time we were done we took the 4:00 cruise and we didn't waste any time. We finished by 5:00 but the Louvre closed that day at 6:00 and we needed time to get over there. Our tickets were good for a few days so we went to the Louvre another day. It is not noted that it might be impossible to get all done in one day, so check the times if you are short on sightseeing time."

It's a to-and-from trip so you get the views from both sides and angles. BTW, even if seating space is provided, you end us standing outside or on top to get the best views and pictures.

You can either walk at street level on broad pathways lined with trees, or take stairs or a ramp down to the river side. I walk up at street side, then down riverside on my daily walks. The river side walk is so vital. Along the river you find the tour boats, working barges, people having picnics at well placed public tables (free!) , outdoor cafes near Pont de Alexandre, climbing walls, and more. It feels very safe as there are friends, families, tourists, singles all out and about at all hours. A must do in my opinion, and not strenuous at all."

Some Parisians even waved to us when we passed by.The boat was spacious and felt very safe. Each seat had a headset where you can hear short summaries about the notable buildings we passed by, thankfully with a couple of language choices.Great way to rest after a long day of walking, but I don't recommend to do when it's sunny because it can be pretty hot. If your boat has a secure top deck, I hope you try it! The downside is, no headsets.Note: This was part of our Paris City Pass."

On one visit, the floods in Northern France had caused the Seine to rise to its highest levels in decades. Most museums were closed on account of the rising waters. It was bursting it's banks and had swallowed the pavements and roads along its banks. One could see the tops of the trees and some structures. It looked powerful and beautiful. On another visit the waters had fallen and I spent evenings with lovers, friends and other travellers in time, listening to musicians, philosophers, and the sounds of Paris along the banks."

I wish we hadn't - it was a horrid experience and dirty. The London, River Thames is more pleasant and England has some lovely river walks with pubs, beautiful canals and punting in Cambridge is devine in comparison. Perhaps the English are spoilt for choice!?"

Me and my partner decided that as well as purchasing a 'hop on hop off' sight seeing bus ticket we would purchase a one hour river cruise tour down the river seine. The price was roughly around \u20ac40 per person for 2 day unlimited tour and a one hour river cruise. This cruise had seating upstairs and down with available telephone handsets which has a range of different languages that talks you through the sights. We highly enjoyed this as it was great to be able to see all of the gorgeous views and learn a lot about the history of Paris."

It has beautiful, historical buildings along it's banks. The city has created great areas for citizens and guests by blocking street traffic in the summer and creating \"beaches\". It has many beautiful bridges of a variety of styles--pleasing to the eye as well as providing crossings at frequent intervals and the river is narrow enough to cross and re-cross to enjoy both sides."

Walking gives you the time to stop and look and explore. Looking at all the spectacular displays of boats is incredible. People live on them. Some have full gardens on board. So interesting to look at. There are different stairways that take you down to the water from the sidewalk. We saw many people with picnics and wine having group and paired meals together along the river. They also have an outdoor bookstore which is difficult to explain. There are individual vendors who keep their stores permanently built onto the ledges of the water and it goes on for what seems forever. A cruise allows you to see more in a smaller amount of time and really get a feel for the waterway. Seeing an island built from stone with interconnecting bridges was one interesting thing discovered. And fabulous views of the many sites around the city. And so many bridges with their own stories. Especially the Eiffel tower; Just gorgeous."

We chose to go after 9PM to see the city lights. The tower sparkles every hour for about five minutes after sunset. That is a spectacular sight! I strongly suggest you do take a cruise the first day you are there. It helps to put all the tourist attractions, like the Louvre, Eiffel tower into perspective in terms of distances. The tour guide will tell you what attractions you are crossing. We took the Bateaux Mouches cruise. Not very expensive and it goes every half hour or so. Also enough seats on the top deck for a lot of people. If you don't get a seat on top, just wait for the next one."

Also because we travel with our dog (since it's difficult finding a transportation which allows pets in Paris).It's a nice walk along the Seine. Not difficult and with good stops for pics (you pass points of interest like the \"Pont Alexandre III\", the \"Jardin des Tuileries\" etc.). We started on the southern side of the Seine. But it was very windy that day and dust kept flying into our faces. We decided to walk on the other side, which was a lot better.Some parts are a bit unexciting, but all in all if you are visiting the Eiffel Tower and want to go to the Louvre (or the other way around), it is a rewarding stroll and you really don't need a taxi, metro or bus to do that. One way was enough though :)Wanna know more about me and my trips? Check my profile."

The river is 780 km long and flows for about 40 km in bisecting through Paris. There are 37 bridges on the river within the city. The best way to get a flavor of this river is to take a cruise boat on the river. We took the boat from Concorde and the cruise continued up to Noterdam church and back to Concord in a 45 minutes cruise. On the way you can see famous Alexandre III bridge, Eiffel Tower. It was the best and cheapest mode of seeing the riverside Paris."

Teenagers may find this relaxing and a nice place to sit down but overall not massively engaging. Nice descriptions and historical facts appear occasionally, and there are good photo opportunities but I have to admit that once was enough and upon returning I slept through most of the journey. Make sure to take suncream in summer! Also drinks & snacks for younger members of the family may be required."

It's a small ship with no more than 150 passengers. The service, food and attention to all details is awesome. The itinerary is marvelous starting in Paris, traveling through little cities along the Seine River. The highlight of this itinerary is a visit to the beaches of Normandy to follow the steps of thousands of American soldiers that died in the invasion of D day: a very moving experience.I highly recommend this cruise line and this itinerary."

We went on a double decker boat cruise, sat on the top deck with a tour guide telling us about everything we passed. It really is a brilliant way to spend an hour in Paris. We saw the Eiffel Tower, The Louvre, Notre Dame Cathedral and many other sights of interest along the way. Took loads of pictures and enjoyed the breeze of the boat cruising along on a very hot August day. Bring your hat and sunglasses and keep your camera at the ready. We did notice a boat cruise that passed us where you can hop on and off at 8 destinations, so to save on walking, you might want to try that instead. But if you want to sit back and enjoy the experience rather than use the boat as a mode of transport to get to places, then I highly recommend it. There are also dinner cruises, very good in the evening I hear. Something on the Seine to suit all tastes :)"

An evening view of Parisans sitting on Sience river banks, enjoying life was the highlight of my day. All ages, families, couples, friends - it seemed as if all of Paris was sitting on the river banks - I decided they had the secret of happiness & joy. Just like the movies, enjoying wine, picnics, friendship. Babies & grandmas, lovers & friends. Is there anything left to ask for. The Batobus was a great introduction to Paris. We bought tickets online, but can also purchase along the river at their docking stops. HIGHLY recommend!"

When visitjng Paris this is a must and one which you can not avoid.We took a nice stroll along the banks of the Seine which has a number of small parks and entertaining spaces along with street entertainers which really gave this walk some great atmosphere.Due to the heightened risk in the area, there was as you would expect a high presence of military and Police with guns. This could either worry or put you at ease, either way we felt safe in Paris throughout.The only downside to this walk was the smell of urine, norm ally under the bridges but this could be down to the lack of public conveniences in Paris.Overall, a great stroll anytime of the day in the sun!"

We always ended up just walking along the banks and its beautiful to watch the sunset and rise over. Try taking one of the river cruises and you will find out a lot more of the history of the river itself. I believe they do a wonderful job with all the walk ways alongside the river."

It is beautiful and seductive, especially at night. It runs in the middle of the city and a boat ride, or a cruise, can take you to see many sites. It has countless bridges along its path, and the views are spectacular. A walk along the river banks is very relaxing, just as standing on one of the bridges gives you a breathless feeling. It is just a great river."

We had to stand in a very long queue for 45 min (not possible to sit down) to get on the boar which was a bit of a drag. But once on it, its a very nice excursion and they have headphones so you can listen to the pre-taped guided tour."

You can wait for up to a year to use the boat ticket but we went straight to the boat after out trip to the Tower. It was a nice relaxing experience after the Eiffel Tower which was very busy. The Bateaux Parisiens are state of the art trimarans and you have the option of the airy cabin with a multi lingual handset and CCTV screens of the views ahead and astern, or on the sleek wooden upper deck which has the best view and you enjoy the atmospheric moments as you pass under the famous bridges. However, the commentary is, inevitably, rather indistinct. The combined ticket meant that we covered both these \"must do\" Paris attractions in a long afternoon. Tip; if you fancy one of the (very good) photos that the roving photographer takes at the start of the trip take your opportunity to buy them when you disembark including any extra copies as the photographers don't keep the pictures."

As a result, we did not reserve a river cruise, which looking back, I regret. If you are not able to book a cruise, you can still enjoy the Seine from one of the many bridges that cross it. The closer you get to the Louvre, the more impressive the bridges are. Also, try to be at the Seine at sunset - truly glorious! There are pathways close to the river. You can walk or jog along the water. I'm not sure if it is because of all the rain, but there were a lot of mosquitoes along the river at the lower level. I recommend bug spray during warmer, wet months. No restrooms. If you need to use a restroom, you will have to buy a coffee or beer in a nearby cafe and say \"Si vous plait\" with giant puppy dog eyes. In return, they will let you go. The French are merciless when it comes to this. I actually had to pay 70 cents at the train station to use the potty. Anyway, the Seine is gorgeous. If you are staying in Paris, it will be hard to miss."

If you have the opportunity, try to take a cruise along the Seine at night (I suggest a company Bateaux Parisians who do the Cruise really well - good food, plenty of drinks and music and entertainment). Book the later cruise to ensure you see Paris (and particularly the Eiffel Tower) lit up - just gorgeous (take a camera with you) and gives you a different view to the day time photo's. I know this sounds a really 'touristy' thing to do, however, it is really worth doing (from someone who doesn't particularly do all the 'touristy' things!)."

After about 1/2 hour in line with our prepaid tickets purchased from home, we were on one of the many tourist boats for a ride up the Seine from the Eiffel Tower area. Being toward the front of the line, we could sit almost anywhere and decided to give up our window seats inside the boat for a bench seat outside. The view was short lived as a couple crowded between us and the railing where they stood between variously positioned selfies for the remainder of our hour trip. I circled the boat inside and out to find a better spot, found none, and returned to where my husband was on the bench. The rest of the trip I perched on the edge of the seat, but could see nothing downstream past the standing couple. The high water from the previous floods covered the sidewalks next to the river, and made the river too high to go under the bridge closest to Notre-Dame so the boat turned around just short of it (totally understand....they can't help the water level). Altogether it was a less that hoped for experience for both of us."

            "review": "A River Cruise to Remember. In 2016, France had the wettest May/June in 100 years. On June 3, the Seine River peaked at 6.1 meters (20 feet), which was a 34 year high. Having arrived in Paris May 30, we couldn't help but notice that the many dinner cruise and sightseeing boats were unable to sail under any bridges: entry booths were flooded, bike racks invisible under water, and gang planks led from the boats at a very steep angle, if they hadn't been removed already.Our eight-day Paris-Paris Seine River cruise with Avalon Waterways - scheduled to begin June 7 - was also in serious jeopardy. On June 4, Avalon advised us of the situation and offered two options: a full refund, or a partial refund if we continued. Choosing to continue, we met on June 7 and they bussed us to Rouen where the ship was docked. For the next 8 days, Avalon rearranged itineraries, buses and cruise schedules to accommodate every tour normally included in the package. And for good measure, they threw in a previous extra-cost tour to Honfleur at no cost.With just about 1/2 the full passenger load, the ship (Avalon Creativity) was spotless inside and out; the crew were excellent, the food wonderful. Guides at each stop were interesting and spoke excellent English, and the buses were clean and comfortable. By June 14, the Seine had receded enough to allow us to dock in the northern part of Paris, which was as close as possible to the regular dock given the circumstances.Special accolades to the Captain and Cruise Director who worked tirelessly to keep us up-dated and provide the best experience in the safest manner. Kudos to Avalon Waterways for putting on a first-class effort to ensure a great holiday."

If you are on a quick visit to Paris, take either a boat taxi, or book yourself a lunch or dinner cruise on the river Seine. Strolling along the river, did not offer much to my husband and I. It is a bit smelly and not very clean, though we saw many people enjoying a drink or a smoke along its banks. For us it lacked natural beauty, as everything is stone. It could use a bit more natural features (i.e. grass, flowers, etc.) to increase its appeal."

The best part of the Seine is the bridges, the art on the Left Bank, and all of the people walking around taking in the sites. If you are visiting Paris, you definitely need to see the Seine River."

I regard this river as the 'pulse' of the city - adding atmosphere with its flowing waters and bridges in all seasons and at all times of day. There are ample opportunities to boat on the river but one of the joys of traveling around the city on foot or by vehicle is seeing the wonderful bridges (over 30 of them) and river views. No two scenes are the same and the river has inspired so many writers and artists over the years. A city definitely to be recommended."

This cruise is included when you purchase the Paris Pass Lib, which also includes unlimited rides on the underground metro system, 1 day of hop on/hop off bus touring with L'Open Bus and fast track entrance to museums.  The boat cruise was definitely a highlight of our weekend in Paris. We decided to ride on Saturday evening after visiting the Eiffel Tower. The office and boat dock for this company is located very near the Eiffel Tower, on the same side of the river.  We had good timing, as the sun was setting over the river behind us. Plenty of outdoor seating was available and we chose to sit/stand at the back of the boat to view the sunset. The ride is very smooth and pleasant.  Various tourists and locals would wave at the boat from the bridges we passed under and from the walls along the shore. Locals really enjoy their river and the shores were filled with people just hanging out...eating dinner, talking, kissing or playing music.  In my opinion, the essence of this beautiful city is well represented while cruising through the heart of town along the Seine. By just being there and being a part of it...waving back at friendly locals, watching the sunset while passing the Notre Dame Cathedral, returning to the Eiffel Tower lit up. I highly recommend it."

My wife and i love walks along the river and have walked from the Eiffel Tower to Notre Dame on many occasions - with historic bridges, fabulous architecture and a constant flow of tourists, there is always something to see.Be sure to make time to take a cruise (or two) on the river - the scenery is stunning during the day - and takes on a completely different look at night when the sun sets and the city lights up.Don't miss it!"

The real test of any service provider is not just how they do in the best of conditions (which in this case was superb) but also how they handle unforeseen situations. We were on our cruise of the Seine River during the flooding this past week and had to leave the ship 2 days early. Avalon put all guests up in a fabulous hotel, Le Collectioneur, provided meals -- even giving us lunch money because the hotel didn't serve lunch, comped several optional tours, and on top of this gave us a 50% refund for the two nights. The cruise director was with us the entire time. They had us all checked in when we arrived and made the two days absolutely pleasurable. The ship, Tapestry II, was beautiful beyond expectations. Cabins were beautifully appointed, large, immaculate and the toiletries were first rate. The staff couldn't have been more courteous or efficient, tours were excellent with superb guides, and food was surprisingly good and consistent. I highly recommend Avalon for your next river cruise."

Starting from near the foot of the Eiffel Tower we passed under the Pont Alexandre II and by the Louvre and Notre Dame Cathedral. From the river you get a magnificent view of the back of the cathedral with the flying buttresses. Turning around at the National Library we sail back up watching the people enjoy the warm afternoon sun. The cruise took us up and around the Statue of Liberty so that both sides of the boat could take pictures."

It was a 1 hour boat ride. We enjoyed it very much. You can sit outside - sit close to the heater (on the right side of the back of the boat) - so you can stay warm. Do wear something warm - since when the boat goes, it gets breezy. The views were nice - we took it around 9:00 pm so we got the twilight hour which was great for taking pictures. You get a nice overview of all the main sites of Paris. It is romantic and sweet."

Walking along the river is lots of fun and free, but you should also catch one of the river barges right on the river next to the Eiffel Tower, plenty to choose from and all pretty much the same price. I suggest you spend a day or two walking along the river banks, perhaps one of the good walking tours, and seeing the Cathedral de Notre Dame. Then as dusk starts to set head down to the river and catch a tour as it starts to get dark. The Eiffel Tower gets lit up as do all the bridges and buildings and the the tour really becomes magical. If you want to hear lots of interesting facts then make sure you are inside (some boats only have speakers on the inside) but the best view our outside on top deck. The trip is a great way to rest from a long day of walking about, then it's off to dinner!"

This is the heart of the city and tour boats are a constant presence, as are people longing on grassy areas along the banks or strolling the sidewalks to view the wares of the booksellers. If you want to truly FEEL Paris, spend time by the river in each arrondissement and just take in the sights, sounds, and scents.Practically, this is also a great way to orient yourself in a big city where it would be easy to get lost. Then again, getting lost may not be such a bad thing!"

Dinner cruises, narrated and bare bones excursions, trips with (annoying to most) flood lights for after dusk trips. Be aware, the trips are not all pretty much the same. We were expecting to have a narrated trip pointing out the major landmarks and offering some other local knowledge - we were disappointed. The company we chose also inexplicably closed the upper observation deck to passengers under the premise that the river level made that an unsafe seating area; this despite other boats with higher profiles safely accommodating their guests topside. I'd suggest avoiding Bateaux Parisiens, located just to the east of the Eiffel Tower on the south (left) bank. There are better options for you."

One thing that you should understand about this city is that it was levelled at one point and then rebuilt to be aesthetically pleasing. Before that the place was a mess, streets had no layout and were generally just going here and there after the middle ages. After they revamped it it became one of the most beautiful cities to behold in the world. And I think the best place to start is on the river. We took a boat cruise along the river and there were audio guides for us to listen to but for the life of me I can't find the company that ran it. But there were other boats so I think you can just go along and join them spontaneously."

If just watching all that doesn't make you thirsty or for those who prefer their walk a little less strenuous then head to the Pont Alexandre to the one of the many pretty cafes and river bistros and partake in the Parisian pastime of people watching accompanied by 'un verre'. On the right side it's less active but for those wanting to find a quieter spot to picnic and watch the many bateaux passing along loaded with tourists all enjoying the beautiful scene from the Seine then take yourself to this side of the river . During August the right side turns into a real life city beach as tonnes of sand is deposited along the banks, deck chairs are unfolded and parents whether local or just visiting can take the kids for a fun filled day at 'la plage'."

It's hard to imagine any other city that has such a polished tourism product, interesting and diverse history as the Seine through Paris!"

As the cruise was about to come to an end, it started drizziling and the Eiffel Tower came into sight. I was sitting on the open deck of the cruise and thank goodness my camera was waterproof and I did not have to worry about it getting drenched. Even though it rained while I was on the cruise, I would still recommend to go for a cruise with a open deck as there wont be a roof obstructing your view in every single photo you capture. However, do also make sure to check the weather beforehand to avoid disappointment if it rains really heavily! :)"

Close up views of the Notre Dame and the islands of La Cite and St-Louis. Also past many of Paris's main attractions. The highlight of the cruise to view the Eiffel Tower as it turned on its lights for us. We were witness to a show of hundreds of flashing lights draped over the Tower,"

The boat was very nice but it was quite chilly to sit up top in the open air even on a sunny 60 degree day. Towards the end we headed downstairs where it was warmer. I am sure upstairs is spectacular in the summer. My problem with the tour was the guide. She spoke in French, English and I think Italian (or Spanish?) My daughter called the speaking Franglish. We could not tell when one language ended and another began! It was rapid fire with a heavy french accent, so we actually could barely understand any or what was being said as we went buy all sorts of beautiful buildings and landmarks. Luckily we are familiar with Paris so we could kind of figure out what she was saying. If you go on a cruise, just enjoy the view!"

Bateaux Mouches has a ramp leading down to the office.The price is good, as is the service.

Great views of all the sites along the river and an opportunity to see up close this is still a working waterway with commercial barge traffic as well as tourist craft. Did not take a romantic dinner cruise in the evening sadly - will do that the next time "

We crossed over on foot as many of the bridges as we could (more than 10) and then we took a scenic river cruise in the late afternoon and got some glorious pictures! There is so much to do around the river and yet at times, some of the most peaceful place to be in Paris!"

However, our recent family trip found us on the banks of the Seine in a queue for the Bateaux Parisien. The nearly one-hour tour was exactly what we needed to orient our children to the city. As it was a beautiful day, we decided to ride on the rooftop of the boat. This is excellent for those who know the city; however, for first-timers, its best to stay inside. The multi-language tour is only accessible from within the boat, where each seat is equipped with a personal handset."

I went on a river cruise on the River Seine whilst in Paris.Whilst the River Cruise can be a good way to see Paris, the seat that you sit on will depend on the view you get. I presume that a seat at the front would give you a good view but the seat I was sitting on (on an aisle near to the back) did not give you a good view of Paris at all.Also, the seats were quite uncomfortable to sit on for an hour, having said that you are allowed to move around the boat.But overall, unless you get a great seat, the river cruise is not something I can recommend. I would, instead, recommend you to see Paris on foot, where you know you will be able to see the magnificent structures that Paris has to offer."

            "review": "THE REAL ESSENCE OF PARIS IS CAPTURED BY THE RIVER SEINE. The river Seine flows right through the heart of Paris bordering 10 of the 20 arrondissements. It was no accident that the city evolved around this gigantic avenue for commerce and transportation, or that the early Parisi tribes on the river's island were attacked and overthrown by the Romans. This early coup took place on what was later to become some very prime real estate. At that time the river was called by it's Latin name: Sequana. The river is still the chief commercial waterway and half of the water used in Paris still comes form the Seine. Don't think about that when you look at the sick green water flowing under the bridge, or when your waiter brings you a glass of tap water.Paris, the river Seine looking downstream Tourists are often confused about the terms \"right bank\" and \"left bank\" and spend hours on street corners with crumpled maps trying to orient themselves and figure out which side of the riverbank they are standing on. The system is very simple and was devised because the river's curvy nature often does make orientation difficult. The trick is to remember when you face DOWNRIVER the left bank is on your left and the right bank is on your right. If you can't tell left from right at this point you should not be traveling alone. If you can't figure out which way the water is flowing (don't look at the boats, they go upstream too!) drop a potato chip or look for some debris and see which way it's floating. Then you will be able to make it to the Caf\u00e9 Les Deux Magots on time, and not end up at La Defense. There are 32 bridges on the river in Paris, some of them more impressive than others. The Oldest bridge is the Pont Neuf which has been immortalized by artists and poets and even 20th century films. (see The Lovers of the Pont Neuf) There is a beautiful little island crossed by the bridge which the riverboat tours now use as a docking station. In the spring or summer it's a wonderful place to hang out on a bench under the willow trees, or sunbathe on the slanted stone embankments near the tended gardens in its center. To get there, simply make your way toward the equestrian statue of Henri V and find the steps leading down toward the docks. If you are the kind of person who likes watching boats this is a great spot. Actually it is one of the nicest places to hang out in all of Paris.Beyond the mere technical facts surrounding the river and its environs is a deeper and more inexplicable attraction. The water speaks to us of a past we will never experience but nevertheless find ourselves linked to by association. Staring at the murky river from a cold bridge in a Parisian winter it is impossible not to think of Paul Celan, the tormented poet of the holocaust, who plunged to his death in those same waters, or the less known victims of French revolution when hundreds of bodies were dredged from the depths, or simply the unnamed who also met their ends at the river bottom. This is not to say the river represents a cult of death, but it's interesting to conceive of it as part of the full cycle of life. Great triumphs and great tragedies have occurred near the river which less aware tourists view as the background to their photo collection.  Note: The BATOBUS sails up and down the seine from the Eiffel Tower to the Institute Du Monda Arabe with stops along the main attractions. It works just like bus service which you can hop on and off. You can buy a day pass or a two day pass and use it to travel up and down the river at your pleasure. The boats are nice too--- wooden decks and glass walls and roof. See Batobus Cruises and Paris Cruises, Mini & Dinner CruisesFor all those who love rivers, hotels close to or on the Seine include the 3-star Hotel De Orsay, Hotel Verneuil, the Hotel Albe. The 3 star Hotel Le Notre Dame, Citadines Apart'hotel Saint Germain Des Pr\u00e9s, and the 4-star Les Rives de Notre-Dame are right on the river across from the cathedral. All located in the Latin Quarter"

There is always something happening on the quays so prepare to just stroll and see what pops up !! Browse the bookseller stalls to pick up souvenirs an occasional book in English and other memo-toes of your trip. Just don't take pictures unless you have permission.Pending where you are activity along the Seine can be busy or quiet and low key. The quieter areas are great for picture taking . You can get some breathtaking pictures of Notre Dame from here. During the evening the lower quays take on another life they come alive with bands people dancing .During the day the lower quays are generally quieter with beautiful parks and open spaces in some places. While walking across many of the bridges you will find artists painting and occasionally someone selling something they just created."

You need to start early if you want to make a few of the stops, such as Notre- Dame, Jardin des Plantes, Musee d'Orsey, Eiffel Tower etc. Its not easy for people with disabilities as there are stairs or steep drives from the river stops as well as failry long walks to some of the sights. Families with prams seemed to do well. We were disappointed that 2 stops were closed as it was not yet summer season. However, it would seem that one could manage 3 stops well and then do quicker sightseeing stops at the others. The boat comes past every 30 minutes, but one cannot always time it well. It might be better to do a two day pass, especially if one's hotel is close by. There was no commentary but staff did speak a few languages."

First, the flexibility of the hours were much appreciated, as our tickets let us board any time every half hour between 10:30am-10:00 pm. The boat has glass for walls and ceiling so you can see tall buildings on both banks. It starts at the base of the Eiffel Tower at pontoon 3, and ends there as well. They gave us ear phones to plug-in with about 15 channels for various languages. The dialogue was a little bit hokey but we laughed and enjoyed it. Most of the boat is enclosed but there is a narrow outdoor deck with railings if you want to feel the breeze. Paris is a city built on the river and it was fantastic to see the familiar monuments from a different point of view. We highly recommend it."

The Allies' intention was to reach the Seine by 90 days after D-Day. That objective was met. An anticipated assault crossing of the river never materialized as German resistance in France crumbled by early September 1944. However, the First Canadian Army did encounter resistance immediately west of the Seine and fighting occurred in the For\u00eat de la Londe as Allied troops attempted to cut off the escape across the river of parts of the German 7th Army in the closing phases of the Battle of Normandy.\" Research the history of this magnificent waterway before you go, take a tour of it, and definitely a river cruise."

One of my highlights was going under the bridges. The architecture is simply the best I have ever seen.Please take the time out to spend some time on this beautiful river."

There is no entry on Trip Advisor for the Jardin Flottant Nikki de Saint Phalle, which is a relatively new green space on the left bank of the Seine, one of the places on my \"to see\" list on this trip to Paris. The roadway for cars was replaced with a green space, bike paths, walking and jogging paths, play areas, etc., and it is a delightful walk right next to the river (not on the upper sidewalk, which we've walked in the past. The Floating Garden is just one part of this whole development, and, unfortunately, it was not accessible in the winter - the little cross bridge was raised. But there was enough to see and enjoy and imagine how delightful it must be in the spring and summer months. There have been some interesting articles about this development in Paris, reclaiming areas for pedestrians and making it harder for cars to pollute the city. Sure, some motorists are not happy, but I think the trend is great - I understand the project is not yet complete and I hope to see it extended on my next visit to Paris. This is what I returned to Paris for, and I was not disappointed."

This was something that I've always promised myself I'd do one day and it didn't disappoint, not even a little bit.We walked along the river everyday we were in Paris at some point and covered its length from Pont Mirabeau to Pont d'Austrilitz. There were one or two points were the traffic intruded a little but the easy solution was always to cross onto the south bank it seemed.We spotted a number of sights we'd have missed had we been jumping on and off the metro to cover the distances between some of the other attractions we wanted to see. On our last day we walked well over 4 miles alongside the river along the south bank (we did have to back track a little as I may have made a slight error in navigation) and this provided some of the best views of the holiday.It was peaceful and really rather relaxing and although it was also very very cold we were both well wrapped and there were plenty of spots to be able to stop and partake in coffee or in my case hot chocolate. Wifey did initially think about us taking a river tour but by the third day she'd changed her mind and I have to say I'm rather pleased she did as I found it a far more satisfying experience being able to explore at ground level and to be able to take in all the sights, sounds and textures at first hand rather then sit listening to a diesel engine working away."

The river flows westward through the city, so the Left Bank refers to the south side and the Right is the north. Notable bridges that connect the 2 banks are the Pont des Arts (A.K.A. the Love Lock Bridge) and Pont Alexandre III (Paris' most intricate bridge). The river also divides the city into two halves, with districts like Le Marais and Montmartre in the north, and Saint Germain and Montparnasse in the south. Landmarks on the Right Bank include the Louvre, Sacre-Coeur, Champs-Elysees, and the Arc de Triomphe, while the Left Bank has the Eiffel Tower and Luxembourg Gardens.

It's far more peaceful and pleasant. You can leave the bustle and go down the stairs right to river level, where there are wide paved pedestrian areas.And if you have kids, this is a life saver. There are playgrounds and other interesting things where kids can burn off energy and have loads of fun. One of the things our 7 and 12 year olds found amusing was a map of the world painted on the pavement. I took a photo with each of them standing on the area they were from and my daughter standing on Paris. We were all endlessly amused by this. I've attached one of those photos here.I would heartily recommend a Bateaux Mouche tour, because it offers a very different and lovely perspective of the city. But walking along the Seine is one of my favorite pastimes in Paris.One of my fondest memories is taking a break on a stationery barge that served coffee, crepes, wine and more. I've attached a photo of that here.The Seine provides a great way to relax after long hours of sightseeing. I would suggest everyone ending their afternoons there or taking a wonderfully refreshing mid-afternoon break.Even just walking along it, up one side and down the other, while looking at all the surrounding buildings is great fun. Both City Hall (Hotel de Ville) and the Musee D'Orsay can be reached this way."

The tour does not really look like what it does in the photos posted on here, but it it still very nice. People are saying the water is filthy, but I wouldn't say it is extreme as that. It doesn't affect your enjoyment anyway. It is nice to go on a boat cruise after walking around Paris, as it is sort of a mini rest to sit down. There is a commentary on the boat, who speaks in English, French, and Spanish. There is interesting facts given about each building / bridge you pass. There is also music played. At night everything is lit up and it is really beautiful to see. People who are walking along the banks, bridges, on passing boats or even dining on the floating boats restaurants wave as you go past. A pleasant experience overall, though quite chilly if you go in an autumn/winter month."

We got to sit at the front of the boat. Had 4-5 tastings/ half glasses of champagne, and had a personal tour guide. Our guide told us all the major historical information as we passed buildings, and in between major topics answered questions we had. Great way to do the boat tour, was $20 more, but well worth it.

So its best to enjoy the river view from the river itself taking a tour with a cruise at around sunset."

We took a Vedette trip, from the Pont Neuf landing, on a clear early evening, with the lights coming on at all the buildings and bridges, while the Tour Eiffel showed up - brightly lit - above the rooflines. Do take a camera for the spectacular bridges' statues and decoration, and windproof coats - although the bateaux have closed canopies.There are plenty of cafes and small restaurants all along the banks, so there's plenty of good cheer when 'vin chaud' or cafe-cognac is called for."

Also saw Monet's place where he lived and did his paintings in Giverney. Several other stops along the way, all of which were interesting. We felt like we really got our money's worth.

A perfect event for just after the Eiffel Tower. One suggestion, the Bateaux Parisian, I recall from my last trip to Paris, would translate the tour into several languages, however, the boat tour we were on, was only in French, so be sure to ask, before you buy a tour, as there are many fascinating details regarding the many bridges you will pass under, some dating back to the revolution, and you don't want to miss hearing about this, like my wife and unfortunately did. I cannot recall the name of the company, however, it was on the same side of the river as the Eiffel Tower. After experiencing both, my vote goes to the Bateaux Parisien company."

We diverted into the side streets of the left bank through the Saint Germain area and finally worked our way back to the river opposite the Hotel de Ville. We then wandered along the left bank of the river along the various quays past the Musee D'Orsay and the Invalides and headed for Pont Alexandre lll. Along the quay on the opposite side to the Tuilleries there is a large recreation stretch with various spots to play games, skate board, jog, or cycle. There are also several shipping containers which have been converted into places to play indoor games and to have a meal. Each container is comfortably appointed and could accommodate about 8 people and comes equipped with a range of board games and indoor activities. There is a nearby kiosk where food and drinks can be purchased. We duly arrived at the Pont Alexander lll - a most attractive bridge with its views to the Eiffel Tower and on to the Champs Elysee - and then to the Grand Palace for the Picasso Mania exhibition. If we had been bolder we could have walked home on the right bank past the Louvre, Hotel de Ville etc but the weather had turned cold and showery by the time we finished our visit to the exhibition so we went home via the Metro. Acjheap day out really and a pleasant way to see Paris at walking pace."

There are many options from different locations near the Eiffel tower area for the boat rides. It is a must do to have the complete Paris experience. During cold days avoid the open top areas as it gets really cold in the waters. If unavoidable carry a cap and muffler(scarf). It is a lifetime experience more enjoyable in the evenings. You have options to have snacks and drinks on the boats at an extra cost. Overall excellent experience with the boat ride. The river Siene is the main attraction in Paris and adds beauty to the city's landscape. Just keep walking along the river and most of the attractions are located around it. An Open tour Bus would be a good option to go around. The original Status of Liberty is also located on an Island in the Siene river about a km from the tower. Do see it.....though it is much smaller than its American Replica (which was gifted by France to the US)."

It seemed like we still had to stand in a long line to \"pick up\" our boat ticket.-- This is a great way to see the bridges in Paris.-- There are toilets on the boat!

The Seine is beautiful at night! We took the Champagne Tour of the Seine and Eiffel Tour on our first night in Paris. This helped us to know the history of many of the buildings and areas that we subsequently visited."

They run a number of hop on hop off cruises through the river. these cruises stop at all major attractions. Yes a few might be a little far from the main ports, but the fact that you sail under the numerous bridges and can say a small prayer/wish each time you cross one and admire the collossal structures at the same time , gives an altogether different perspective of this beautiful city."

During our first visit to Paris, two years prior to this visit, we had been captivated by the River Seine. When we returned, we were pleased to be able to spend some of our time walking along the banks of the river. Our first visit had seen us be able to take an evening cruise along the Seine. This visit, we were unable to squeeze another cruise into our busy schedule but we were able to see quite a lot simply by walking along both sides of the river. The attractions located along the banks of the river are too numerous to list here but amongst our favourites were the Louvre, Notre Dame Cathedral and of course, the Eiffel Tower.The river itself was a busy waterway, with a seemingly never-ending parade of both cruise boats and work boats. During the early evening, crowds of people, both locals and tourists alike could be found sitting along the banks of the river, having a drink, \u201cshooting the breeze\u201d and watching the water and the boats flow by.If you are visiting Paris, do make an effort to spend some time either by, or on the River Seine. It really is the \u201clife-blood\u201d of Paris!"

If you have seen some big-city rivers, such as the Mississippi from Memphis, the Hudson from New York, or even the Thames from London, you see large waterways of world commerce which seem mostly outside of the realm and the life of the city. Yes, those rivers are there, but if they weren't the city life would not be such an immensely different experience. But Paris without the Seine? Impossible! Whether seen from a cruise (some of the luncheon and dinner cruises are wonderful!) or from a stroll along its banks or from the Eiffel Tower, the Seine breathes Paris and Paris breathes the Seine. A stroll along its banks, past the small postcard and nick-knack stands, while taking in the surrounding Parisian architecture, can fulfill a whole day. Stopping to eat at a caf\u00e9 along the way (there are some wonderful ones at Blvd. Saint-Michel) will only enhance the lovely experience. Go breathe in Paris!"

The view of the Paris from the river is extraordinary. There is only one River Seine and you will see areas you would not otherwise know existed were it not for a knowledgeable guide pointing them out to you.

My folks and I spent our final evening in Paris on a dinner cruise on the Seine, which departed from and returned to the Bateaux Mouches. It was a genteel, relaxing way to enjoy the views while enjoying a fine meal and pleasant music. Admittedly, it brought home the fact that the river is much lower than some of the sights along its \u201cbanks\u201d (read: concrete and stone), so if you\u2019re hoping for fabulous river shots of Notre Dame, prepare to be disappointed. Also, our boat was glass-enclosed, which created real photo-taking problems with reflected interior lighting once it got dark. Nevertheless, it was a fun experience and worth the time. A good way to unwind, too."

With the hop on tour we got on at one stop and got off in another which was very convenient. We opted for the day trip but ended it around sunset which was very romantic. Would highly recommend everyone to enjoy the river."

Adhering to their schedule with extremely limited free time on all excursions. We book 3 day pre-cruise stay in \"5 star\" hotel, 3 more like it. The location was the best part of those 3 days. Bed, sheets, towels in hotel and on ship were mediocre at best. Service excellent on ship but couldn't make up for the other disappointments. Food not memorable. Doubt any of us will ever step foot on a Viking Cruise again. And it was quite $$$$$"

It was a short walk once you cross the street from Eiffel and gone down the stairs to the pier area. We were thinking it's just some small boat fitting 10-12 people and a rough ride. But to our pleasant surprise, the boat was gorgeous inside and out. Very steady. Glass windows everywhere. It even has a top / 2nd floor which you can get a panoramic view. The cooperative weather did help the experience. My wife thoroughly enjoyed it! And I got to see some of the sites, like Notre Dame, Assemble Nationale from another perspective! It's very cool!

There are a few tours to choose from, one hour tours (which we did), lunch or dinner cruises and the Batobus which is a hop-on hop-off style tour, along the Seine. Obviously I can only recommend the first since that was our preference."

One of the best (and most romantic) is a leisurely stroll along the banks of the Seine.Not on the street level - get down on the river. There is a paved walkway all along it.We took a 2 hour stroll on the right bank from the Rue de Bac to the Eiffel tower and captured many a photographic moment. The boats that are tied up along the river, the views of the Musee D'Orsay, Eiffel tower, and the numerous bridges (including Pont Alexander) from this viewpoint should not be missed.And it's relaxing!"

They were a bit dull, though, as all concrete and nothing to break the monotony. There were not very many boats moored on the river or moving along it here.When we were nearer to Notre Dame, there were a number of companies offering river tours, and this was a nice way to see the sights and historic buildings that line the Seine.I think I have little else to say - my comments have dried up!"

Anyway you choose to do it gives you a different view and perspective of the city. We tried to experience all three while we were there and found it very relaxing continue to be down on the Seine during our trip. However, like other areas of Paris, be careful of Scammers down there who may try to get you to \"sign\" a piece of paper. They are there to scam you or rob you. It is easy to just say no and walk away though."

Make sure to walk across each of the 10 or so bridges that cross Isle de La Cite and Isle de St Louis and east and west of the two islands. There is a cute park just under the Pont Neuf that is worth spending an hour sitting on the benches. You can walk along the main roadways on either side of the Seine or you can walk down to the \"lower level\" along the Seine at various points onto just pedestrian walkways. It is so wonderful to stroll along and watch the people. It is also worthwhile taking at least one of the tourist boat trips on the Seine just to get an overview of the City early on in your trip. Our favorite spot on the Seine was when we walked down some stairs at a small park at the far eastern end of Isle De St. Louis and sat on a bench all by ourselves, watching the water and the boats going by.

The other land tours with the buses you can just use a car or taxi to pass them by briefly, but using the boat you could see the different parts of Paris.They explain it in English, Chinese, Japanese. The history behind most buildings are detailedly explained and its very fascinating. The sceneries are great both in day and night time.Its up to you which you prefer.

The inexpensive river cruise we took left from Pont Neuf (by Notre-Dame) and went past the Eiffel Tower then back all the way around the Isle de Cit\u00e9. About 45 minutes underway. If you can be one of the first on board, by all means head for the prow of the boat so you have a completely unencumbered view of the sights. Otherwise, the middle area of the boat seems about the best with a seat on the outside next to the water giving overall the best view when seated amidships. There are many different cruises available at many different prices. Some stop at several places along the way and visitors can hop off to visit a sight then hop on a later boat to move on to the next stop. Others include a full high quality dinner. Night cruises can be very pleasant and do give a different view of Paris than the day cruises. It is nice for the newcomer wanting to get an overview of the sights along the Seine or for the old-timer who just wants to relax in a pleasant environment while refreshing old memories."

If you are in Paris a boat ride on the river is a must, its a very nice way to discover the city and its beautiful architecture. One can either take the whole package of the river cruise with lunch or dinner ect or you can take a simple boat tour ticket for 13.50\u20ac. There are many companies to choose from and most of the time the tickets can be bought online too.You can take the bateau mouche from Pont Alma, if you are planning to sit on the open roof carry a light pull with you as it can get windy. Try and time it a few minutes before sunset so you can get both the before and after sunset views of the city, and you can see the city slowly light up. Its really nice when you get around the statue of liberty and then it's a feast for the eyes when you end your tour near the Eiffel Tower all lighted up !In any case if you dont have the time or the wish to do the boat tour one of the more popular way the locals do it is to grab your lunch to go and sit on the steps of the river seine and enjoy your lunch while watching the boats pass by and see the people waying at you!"

Unfortunately this meant the description/ history of each individual museum etc. was quite brief.Tips - There were plenty of photo opportunities but a Selphie stick is essential to try and compensate for the low level of the boat on the river. Take the 10.15am cruise to avoid the midday crowds - the best pics of sites are better done on land.Also, consider whether you might prefer to lash out on an evening trip with dinner included with all the sights lit up - the Eiffel is very impressive - (always take an inside table to keep warm)."

We took an evening cruise from the Eiffel Tower down the Seine on our final evening in Paris.What a wonderful finish.Sat on the top deck of the boat so couldn't hear the commentary but this was not a big issue.To take in the sights from the river was memorable but the true memories was of the Parisian people all along the bank enjoying the sun mostly with a bottle of wine.Young ones enjoying each others company and the various areas where dancing took place.The cruise took us past the Louve and with a view of Notre Damme before turning around and returning to the start.Cruise was part of the Paris Pass and I would recommend purchasing this pass as it has great value.For a different perspective of Paris take the cruise down the river its about an hour and well worth it."

You do need a MasterCard or Visa card to guarantee that you will return the bike - otherwise a 150 euro fee applies. It took my daughter and I several attempts to get it all happening - be patient when you insert the card and wait until you are asked for the PIN number, otherwise your card may be rejected. After registering, you recieve a paper ticket with a code number that must be keyed in to the other side of the lecturn/machine and then you can choose the bike number. Check to see that the tyres are pumped up (it is very hard work trying to ride with a flat tyre!). Bikes do not need to be returned to the same station and you do not need to wear a helmet. We rode along the walkway on a sunny Saturday in August, and did not have to worry about vehicles, only avoiding people, which was delightful."

Then we purchased the inclusive tickets and boarded the cruiser. It was a great trip. @ hours long, traversing through all the major sights of the city of Paris, with a very articulate and comprehensive audio commentary about each of the landmarks as we cross them. And all this while sipping the house champagne that is included in the ticket price. Even our 10 year old son found it all very immersive and fascinating. A memorable tryst with history and romance!"

We walked from st-germain Pont arts to pont de sully which is a beautiful stretch of the seine alongside Notre-Dame and the louvre. Lots of locals enjoying picnics, drinking and music and really got a feel for Parisian life. The only thing that spoilt the beautiful walk was the strong stench of urine when walking under the bridges which is such a shame. Id expect the city council to be regularly cleaning the areas as it really is a spoiler on such a beautiful walk."

The boats depart from right in front of the Eiffel Tower and pass under many beautiful bridges and by many famous landmarks, including Notre Dame, etc. The boats leave about every 30 minutes and it's a bit of a zoo during prime tourist season (we were there in August) - I had wished we bought our tickets in advance as we had to wait in line about 45 minutes to buy tickets. When the weather is nice, as it was during our visit, everyone wants to sit up top on the boats, and luckily we were at the front of the line boarding our boat and were able to secure good seats at the very back of the boat where the views were best. Leaving a bit before sunset is ideal - you leave during daylight, but it's dark by the time you return and in our case, the Eiffel Tower was beautifully lit up, and did it's 5-minute (on the hour) light show just as we approached. Just beautiful!"

A few years ago, the south bank of the river used to be a street that got closed, rearranged and made available for all pedestrians to enjoy more than 10km worth on nice views! If you have the stamina for it, just start a nice walk from the Eifel towers along the river all the way to notre dame and let the parisian feeling get into you. Youll find a lot of nice things along the way: the buildings and museums left and right, nice places to have a drink or eat, some of the most astonishing bridges in the world, etc etc etc.You can also get yourself a bike in one of the many Velib stations. Pick it there and return it somewhere else. It easy to book with your credit card, and very userfriendly and afordable. Or you can also just get yourself a ride in one the famous boats and let them do the guiding and you do the looking! Enjoy my running courtyard!!!! ;-)"

            "review": "Good Rinda, Bad Rinda; Pay for Viking gold, get Viking bronze.. 1. Summary: After reading & watching the Viking advertisements and paying top dollar, we were disappointed; we paid for gold, but the Vikings delivered only bronze. We did see a lot of Paris and we did see a lot of other parts of northern France. However, the itinerary could have easily been adjusted to give more time in Paris, Versailles, and Normandy and less time in little villages/towns that were carbon copies of the other little villages/towns that we saw on the previous day. The food was mostly \"ho-hum\" average, with a few really great meals and a few total epicurean disasters. They filled our glasses with wine at every opportunity during lunch and dinner, and champagne was available at breakfast if we felt the need. On a scale of 1 (Poor) to 10 (Fabulous) we rated the trip at \"6\" and most of the other passengers that we talked with on the cruise were in agreement. The overall issue that drove us crazy was the schizophrenic nature of the cruise: one night we would get a truly great meal at dinner, but the next night was just awful; one day we would enjoy a very interesting and well planned guided tour but the next day we were left to wander a small town with yet another gothic church and not much else. If you're a zealous history buff, you may find everything to be exceptionally interesting, but how many gothic churches and former palaces can you visit in one week? France is littered with them. We would have preferred to have had more time at Normandy, the Louvre, and Versailles. Recommendations: Bring comfortable walking shoes and a hat, you will need them. If you plan to take this trip, please remember to put the camera or iPhone down once in a while and actually LOOK at the scenery, paintings, sculptures and other attractions with your own eyes. It's very easy to only see France through the 2-inch screen on the back of your camera and miss out on actually BEING there. We saw countless tourists solidly glued to their cameras throughout the tours, desperately trying to get the perfect picture of something or other, or hell-bent on getting a selfie with the Mona Lisa. I confess that I fell into that \"give me photo or give me death\" category more than once. Also, consider skipping lunch to spend more time in the venues; you can grab some quick ice cream or chocolate crepes or even eat at a cafe without having to take the bus back to the boat.Disclaimer: This was our first trip to Paris and/or France and our first vacation on a Viking River Cruise or any river cruise for that matter. We have previously taken two European vacations to Italy (Rome, Florence, Capri, Pompeii, Venice, Sorrento, and Assisi). We have been on 4 or 5 Royal Caribbean cruises (to the Caribbean) over the last 20 years, plus a Royal Caribbean cruise to Alaska and a cruise around the Hawaiian Islands. Also note that this trip took place in August; that's the month where most people in France head to the beaches and a whole lot of businesses are closed, especially the smaller \"mom and pop\" stores. Note: the French get at least 5 weeks of vacation each year, and they love to use it. The good news was that the traffic was dramatically reduced because everybody was out of town, and since we spent a lot of time sitting on buses, that time really added up. Also note that we were booked on the \"Rinda\", the larger boat that can't dock in downtown Paris, so they docked Rinda in Le Pecq which is a small town about 15 miles west of Paris. The Viking people like to refer to Le Pecq as \"a suburb of Paris\" but that's like calling Baltimore a suburb of Washington DC. They constantly told us that it only took 20 minutes to drive from Le Pecq to Paris, but the helicopter must have been in the shop while we were there since the trip was consistently 55 to 60 minutes one way every time we got on the bus; the red lights and construction zones didn't go on holiday. 2. Airlines - Getting There: They won't make your flight reservations when you sign up for the cruise and pay in full, so you have no idea of what arrangements are going to be made on your behalf until 30 days prior to the cruise. We flew out of Washington DC (Dulles) and they put us on an Iceland Air flight to Iceland (5.5 hours), and then another Iceland Air flight to Paris (3.5 hours). We had about one hour between flights in Keflavik (Reykjavik) where it was 40 degrees (F) at noon on the 3rd of August! Be prepared to be seated on the least expensive flights to and from Paris and for many this means hours of additional travel time; so when some passengers arrive on the ship they may not be in the best of spirits! It seemed that everybody we talked with ended up going through a different stop on the way to Paris. Some went through Iceland, some went through Heathrow/London, some through Munich, some through Stockholm. One couple was flying back home to Baltimore from Paris through Chicago with a 4 hour wait in Chicago. It was interesting that when we switched planes in Iceland, the authorities checked our passports, but when we landed in Paris, there was no immigration or customs; we went from the baggage carousel directly to the public areas of the airport where our Viking representative greeted us and herded all of the passengers into one area prior to getting on the bus for Le Pecq. 3. Does Le Pecq equal Paris? When we booked our vacation back in December, the other Viking River Boats were sold out so the Rinda was our only choice for the first week in August. The advertisements say \"Paris, Paris, and Paris\" but the Rinda is docked in Le Pecq (sometimes referred to by the Viking folks as the \"Port of Paris\"). It's a 1-hour Viking-provided bus ride to downtown Paris (Louvre, Notre Dame) one-way, so we felt cheated out of valuable time that could have been better spent in the city. The La Pecq issue has become an 800 pound gorilla in the room; we got a special letter prior to departure that explained and defended Viking's use of Le Pecq and the Cruise Director tried to explain away the issue while we were onboard. One good thing about Le Pecq, they have a Monoprix store there (like a Walmart - just a few steps from the dock) where we bought several bottles of wine and some chocolate to enjoy while sitting on our veranda watching the shoreline of the Seine go by. There is a small refrigerator in the cabin and you can stuff 4 or 5 bottles of wine into it; there is a corkscrew in every room. During meals, the waiters will be happy to open a bottle of wine that you provide if you want to go that route.4. Das Boat & Das Staff: We were in Cabin 335, an \"A\" Stateroom with the veranda. We had a king size bed with one chair, 2 end tables, a bureau for the clothes, a closet, a digital safe, a small refrigerator, and a flat screen TV. There was just enough room to walk around the bed. The bathrooms are small and the shower measured about 4 feet wide and 24 inches in depth at one end and 18 inches in depth at the other end. The larger staterooms include a sitting area and larger bathrooms and showers. The veranda was just wide enough for two chairs and a small table. We used the veranda during 3 days and 1 night for sipping wine and taking photos of the quaint villages/towns and scenery as we sailed down the Seine. The veranda became our favorite spot for private relaxation during travel time. If you don't get a veranda, the sundeck is always an option. The TV comes in handy; you can get CNN and BBC news, sports, Viking documentaries, maps of the cruise, movies and TV shows if you wish, but you can also listen to the Cruise Director's lectures in the room if you don't want to go up to the lounge before dinner. They also have a camera on the bow of the ship and you can watch the view on the TV 24/7. They provide a variety of music channels, and I found it amusing that what they call \"Pop\" music was mostly rock and roll from the 50s and 60s; I would have called that \"Golden Oldies.\" The suitcases fit under the bed for storage, and a 220-volt hair dryer came with the room. You'll find three or four 110-volt outlets in the room along with three or four 220-volt outlets. They provided life jackets under the bed and a safety exercise was conducted the first afternoon, but they like to joke that if the ship goes down, they will be serving cocktails on the sun deck; the Seine is only about 9 or 10 feet deep in most places and the ship draws 6 feet of water so the boat doesn't have very far to go before hitting bottom and lifeboats are not required. Amazingly, the Seine is only about 100 yards wide in most places so you're never more than 40 or 50 yards from shore during the entire cruise. When it is necessary to turn the boat around, they have to cruise to a wide spot in the river, make the U turn and then cruise back to the ultimate destination. The Seine has 6 locks between Paris and Normandy (think \"miniature Panama Canal\") and it was very interesting every time we entered a lock and the boat went up or down about 12 feet in about 15 minutes. Tours of the wheelhouse are available over several days if you're interested in the technology; the boat has bow thrusters to help make turns or to dock, and they use radar even though the river is very narrow. 5. Where are the toilets? One of the first things that the Cruise Director (Michael B.) covered during the early daily briefings was the astonishing lack of public toilets all over France. We were warned to use any available rest rooms early and often because you would never know when and if you were going to find another one or how long the lines would be waiting to get into one. As a last resort, you might need to duck into a cafe, buy a glass of wine, and go stand in line at their unisex single-use restroom. \"Depend\" under garments might be a consideration for you! Unfortunately, because of the lack of facilities and the huge crowds at the venues, our group tours (typically 20 to 50 people) were delayed by 20 or 25 minutes every time we stopped for a potty break. At Versailles, the Louvre, Giverny, and Normandy, it wasn't unusual to see 10+ women waiting to get into the public ladies' rooms while there was no waiting at the men's room. Occasionally, we found rest rooms at a snack shop where they wanted 70 cents (cheaper than a glass of wine) to use the facilities when you can find them. 6. Paris: If you really want to \"see Paris\", you should consider booking a few days on the front end of the trip or the back end. We saw Notre Dame, the Louvre, and the Eiffel Tower (on the Viking excursions) and we walked mile after mile of Paris streets to visit some museums, stores and cafes on our own. We ended up spending 1 full day in Paris at the beginning of the trip and another full day (including a half day in Versailles) at the end of the trip. We do feel that by adjusting the schedule and reducing/ eliminating the time spent in Les Andeles, we would have enjoyed more time in Paris7. Itinerary: As our first priority, we wanted to see Paris, Notre Dame, the Louvre, Versailles and Normandy. The other stops on the trip were expected to be icing on the cake. We soon realized that Paris requires a lot more time than previously planned, and we were not prepared for the long bus rides and having to wait in lines for everything including restrooms. And, since some of the less-interesting stops ate up more time on the schedule, we felt cheated out of time that we could have spent on our primary objectives. (See the \"Excursions\" paragraph below.) So Bottom Line: It was an \"OK\" itinerary, but it could have been much better.8. Other Guests: The Rinda holds about 200 passengers. About 70 percent of the passengers appeared to be over 65. Maybe 10 percent of the passengers were under 30 with just a few under 18. The remaining 20 percent appeared to be between 30 and 65 years old. A few people were in wheel chairs or used a cane to get around. There are no tables for two on the Rinda, so unless you're travelling with a group, you'll be meeting lots of new people at every meal. So that you can prepare your answers in advance, here are the questions that are universally asked upon meeting unknown passengers: What is your name? Where are you from? Is this your first Viking Cruise? Where else have you traveled with Viking and around the world? What did you do before you retired? Where did you live before you retired? Are your children as deliriously happy, exceptionally smart, amazingly good looking, extraordinarily well educated, and hugely successful as our children? Note: If you intend to get creative with your answers, please coordinate with your travel partner(s) so that you all consistently tell the same fantasies during the cruise! Having said that, please note that we did meet five or six \"very down to earth\" couples who provided very pleasant dinner conversations and travel tips during the week. 9. Meals, Wines, and Lines: Our previous experiences on cruise ships always included excellent meals. The Vikings provided a few excellent meals, a few disasters, and mostly mundane fare. On top of that, the portions usually tended to be small with a few exceptions. I thought we had paid for \"excellent\" and \"bountiful,\" but I guess I was mistaken. We learned a lot on the cruise. We discovered that by adding mushrooms and wine to chicken, you become a Coq au Vin chef, and adding a little cheese to cauliflower makes it \"French Cauliflower.\" If you really want to impress your family, run your mashed potatoes through a pastry decorating bag, and then use a blowtorch to brown the top of the swirl; finally, jam a finger-sized piece of toast into the top of the swirl and you're ready for the kitchen on Rinda (smile). Spinach is \"French spinach\" when it is served in a pastry shell. If you buy wine, they will be happy to pull the cork for you - no problem, no charge.Dinners: The Split Pea soup was very good as was the French Onion soup and the Lobster/Shrimp Bisque (brown, not pink). The pork tenderloin was great. The Beef Wellington was very tasty but the meat was a little on the tough side, and the cheeseburger with fries was excellent; just like at the Outback Steak House. I had a prime rib dinner one night that was very good, but they served it with a little container full of BBQ sauce on the side. How strange; A1 steak sauce would have been much more welcomed. The Coq au Vin consisted of a leg and a thigh with some mushrooms and some kind of wine sauce; it was OK but the portion was on the small side. The plain chicken breast was a safe alternative but totally uninspiring. We tried to avoid ordering things that we didn't recognize on the menu. I ordered the penne pasta with shrimp one night and I got a large bowl of pasta with a plain tomato sauce that reminded me of SpaghettiOs eaten during my childhood, along with three (3) shrimp. Yes, I said three (3) medium sized shrimp. I was insulted and I should have sent it back but I didn't. Later in the week they served a shrimp cocktail appetizer that had 2 large shrimp, thus confirming my conclusion that three medium shrimp does not a meal make. That shrimp cocktail appetizer featured two large raw shrimp that were only partially deveined so I had to finish off the deveining task myself. I was tempted to cook the shrimp over the candle on the table, but I didn't want to make a scene on the Seine. One of our tablemates ordered the scallops one night and got four (4) golf ball-size scallops; the presentation was very nice but the portion size was \"skimpy.\" The night after having the excellent cheeseburger, I decided to give the \"Pulled Pork Sandwich with Cole slaw and fries\" a try, and I ended up getting a Kaiser roll with a compressed pork patty that looked like a 3-inch pancake. The slaw came in a small cup with a few fries alongside. See photo below. Has this chef ever been to Texas? What was he thinking? At the very least, he could have done some research on the Internet. Salads are not typically served with dinner on Rinda, but if you ask, you can get a Caesar salad added to your order. The house wine flowed like water; the waiters refilled our glasses every 10 minutes like clockwork. We received some interesting appetizers; one was a teaspoon filled with some kind of fish chutney; somebody suggested that it was raw tuna but we never managed to verify that guess. I got the steak tartar one night - very thinly sliced raw beef with a tasty sauce. The thought of eating anything raw scares the heck out of me, but when in France, do as the French, right?Lunch: We skipped a lot of lunches to stay at the venue du jour and avoid spending time on the bus and sitting for an hour or more on the boat for lunch. Our Viking-provided lunch at a restaurant in Normandy consisted of wine, a salad, Coq au Vin, scalloped potatoes, some zucchini, cans of soda, and a chocolate dessert. Unfortunately, it took 1.5 hours to get through the Normandy lunch; that time would have been better spent at the museum. One day on Rinda, we stood in a line 10 deep (20 minutes) to get some French-sounding spaghetti thing for lunch. They put some olive oil in a skillet, added spaghetti, threw in some bland tomato sauce, and sprinkled some herbs on top. After simmering that for 4 or 5 minutes it was ready to eat. Again, the taste reminded me of childhood SpaghettiOs. If I ever go on another Viking cruise, I'll bring a jar of Ragu. The French are very big on having salads for lunch, and one day we did the Rinda lunch buffet which included salad, egg salad, pasta salad, some other salads, sausages, pickled herring, and cauliflower covered in cheese. Thankfully, the dessert table was exceptional and my willpower caved in as I sampled a large variety of cakes, pies, cookies, puddings, and candy. Hats off to the pastry chef; he never disappointed. If you're going to France for the wine and pastry you will be in heaven.Breakfast: Rinda serves a great breakfast. They make omelets to order at the buffet line but you might have to stand in line for 15 minutes to get one. Recommendation: Order an omelet from the waiter and you'll get in 3 or 4 minutes from the kitchen. You can also order pancakes, French toast (very dry), eggs, juices, eggs Benedict, and other items from the menu. The buffet selections were endless: champagne, omelets, scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, oatmeal, granola, cereals, yogurts, pastries, bagels, toasted bread, croissants, smoked salmon, fresh fruits, hot stuff that I didn't recognize, some kind of crackers that I didn't recognize, muffins, you name it and it was there. We had absolutely no complaints when it came to breakfast, except that they could have cooked more than one omelet at a time at the buffet table to speed things up. 10. Airport & Driver Issues: Our bus drivers were pleasant, competent and punctual for almost all of the trips with the exception of our return trip to the airport on the last day. That particular driver was late arriving, texted and talked on her cell phone, and even started to read off the list of terminals that each passenger was headed to, all while driving at 60 mph on the highway. I was going to yell \"put down that phone\" while she was changing lanes with one hand, but I didn't know how to say that in French, and she didn't speak English! Also, the Viking representative at the airport took us to the wrong part of the terminal for our Iceland Air flight back to the US, and we would still be there if it wasn't for another passenger finding the ticket counter on his own and leading the way for the rest of us to the right part of the terminal. I think the Vikings are more worried about the arriving passengers than the departing passengers.11. Excursions: Excursions are good. One major issue when you're exploring on your own is having to wait in line for an hour or more when trying to get into a museum (usually a former palace) or other venue; that's not a problem when you're on a Viking excursion since they have group tour tickets with timed entry. Also, having a tour guide is really great since they know where the important stuff is located (it would have been very easy to get lost in the Louvre), they can give you the historical background, and they know where to find the restrooms. Unfortunately, after the (mostly) 2+ hour tours were over, we only got about 30-45 minutes of \"free time\" which is just enough time to visit the gift shop and hit the restroom before getting back on the bus; not enough time to really go off and explore. We tried to get around that problem in Paris by skipping the trip back to the boat for a lunch; that way we could spend more \"free time\" in Paris and catch the last bus back to the boat later that afternoon. We were lucky; the weather was perfect throughout the week except for a little light rain while we were inside the Louvre, but we didn't need the Viking-provided umbrellas at all. The Viking folks provide bottles of water every time you leave the ship - take a few - you'll need them. They also provide little radio receivers (about the size of a cell phone) with earpieces so you can hear the tour guide speaking even if you're 100 feet away; that worked out great since the museums are loud and packed solid with people and we didn't have to stand next to the guide in order to hear her/him.Day 1 - Le Pecq & St. Germain: You can tour the town of St. Germain with a guide in the afternoon to see churches and a former palace, and you can buy wine or other essentials at the Monoprix store in Le Pecq, just a few steps from Rinda's pier. There is a pretty good view of Paris in the distance across the Seine from the Palace in St. Germain. We found an ice cream shop just across the street from the Palace where we sat and enjoyed a break from the walking as we watched the locals for a while. If you arrive from the airport early enough, you can take a Viking bus to Paris, and skip St. Germain, but we arrived at 3 p.m. after the last bus to Paris had already left. St. Germain was interesting since it was our first stop in France; plus we were sleep-deprived from the flight so I'm not sure we could have survived an intense afternoon in Paris. Bottom line: St. Germain was an \"OK\" stop on the itinerary, but not very special when compared to Paris, Rouen, Versailles and Normandy.Day 2 - Notre Dame & Paris: We took the Viking tour of the Notre Dame Cathedral in the morning, but our group had to stand in line for about an hour waiting to get in; no timed tickets there. Then we spent the rest of the day exploring Paris on our own: walking to the Latin Quarter, walking past the Louvre, walking through the shopping districts and walking around a lot of monuments. We had lunch in a small cafe in the Latin Quarter - Pizza and wine no less. Then we walked up the Champs-Elysses to the Petite Palace to catch the bus back to the ship at 5 p.m. So, except for lunch, we walked the entire day. Bring comfortable shoes. The Eiffel tower was plainly visible off in the distance, but it was too late in the day to visit it, and we were booked on the night tour of Paris on the last day when you get to visit the tower when it is all lit up. Bottom line: The first day in Paris was \"good.\" If you can't read a map, and/or you can't walk long distances, you should plan on bringing money for a taxi or a bicycle rickshaw so that you can get around Paris and make it to the return bus on time.Day 3 - Vernon, Giverny & Monet: If you're into art, this is like dying and going to heaven. We took the Viking tour (including express tickets to enter the property and a guide to provide the walking tour) to visit the vast gardens and ponds (complete with lily pads) that Monet used for inspiration when he painted. It was kind of like actually walking through some of his paintings. Then we took a tour of Monet's house (after waiting in line for 40 minutes) including his personal art collection. The gift shop there has a wide variety of unique items, all geared toward Monet of course. There are a few museums and cafes there in the small town of Giverny, but we didn't have time to visit any of them. Day 4 - Rouen - Joanie on the Pony: Rouen was where Joan of Arc was burned at the stake, not exactly Disneyworld, but if you appreciate the religious and historical perspective, you'll probably enjoy the trip. The town is fascinating because a lot of the original medieval structures are still standing and the narrow cobblestone streets wind through the city - it's \"Old France\". Rouen offered endless shops, cafes, and fast food opportunities (think: chocolate-filled crepes, ice cream, chocolate/ candy and McDonalds) along with small art galleries and clothing stores. There's a modern church in the square where Joan met her maker; it's just across from the restaurant where Julia Child became interested in French cooking. Rouen was one of the better venues on the itinerary.Day 5 - Normandy Beaches: The first thing we found out on this tour was that the landing beaches at Normandy cover over 50 miles; that's more than the distance from Atlantic City to Cape May, NJ. It was a 2-hour bus ride from the Seine to the coast. Along the way, our guide provided a large amount of background information along with personal stories about her grandparents' dealings with the occupying Germans during the war. The trip focused on the American cemetery and the beaches where the \"Mulberry\" artificial harbors were used to offload men and supplies after the initial invasion. Unfortunately, we simply drove slowly past many other beaches that contained dozens of relics and several museums on our way to Arromanches where we saw dozens of the concrete breakwaters still sitting on the flats at low tide more than 1/4 mile out from the shoreline. We lost about 20 minutes after arriving due to the long lines at the restrooms. The museum there was packed with people and we had time to watch a 30-minute film that documented the preparations and landings, but we didn't have much time to walk through the extensive museum because the Viking tour focused on feeding everyone lunch at a local restaurant - an hour and a half of valuable time that we would have skipped if we had known how long lunch was going to take. (A crepe or an ice cream on the street would have been sufficient; you might want to consider skipping the sit-down lunch if you go.) It's a shame that we spent more time in the restaurant than we did in the museum or on the beach. After the stop at the Arromanches beach, we headed for the American Cemetery where we walked through the sea of marble crosses and Stars of David that marked the graves of more than 9,800 servicemen and women. We witnessed a memorial service there which was quite moving. The visitor's center/museum was excellent; we spent about an hour there. Then we headed to Omaha Beach at Saint Laurent Sur Mer to see a memorial and the beach where the Americans landed.Day 7 - Les Andeles: They could have skipped Les Andeles all together. When we arrived, a carnival had taken over the docking area so the reality of the surroundings didn't look at all like the Viking Cruise commercials that we saw on TV. There's a partially-destroyed castle on the top of a high hill near the town, and it's a long uphill (steep) climb to get there - maybe a half mile or more. The cruise director previously warned us that the castle tour was not for everyone. We had to stop several times along the way to let everyone catch their breath and wait for stragglers. The view of the Seine and surrounding areas from the castle was beautiful (see photo below). The Cruise Director acted as our guide and he provided an incredible amount of information about Richard the Lionheart and the history of the castle. There was a quaint restaurant at the bottom of the hill and the nearby town provided yet another gothic church, one or two cafes, and a shop or two, but spending an entire day there walking the cobblestones felt like a waste of time since we had already been to Giverny and Le Pecq. We actually resorted to playing miniature golf on Rinda's sun deck for a lack of things to do that afternoon. Les Andeles was one of the most disappointing venues on the itinerary.Day 8 - Louvre: We paid 69 Euros each for the Viking-provided Louvre tour. We arrived with our tour guide at a few minutes before 9 a.m. just before the doors opened. We were the second group in line at the \"Group\" entrance so we got in very quickly. The Louvre is enormous and 10 million tourists visit it each year. Our guide walked us through several sections over 2 hours which included the \"must see\" Venus de Milo, the Mona Lisa, and the winged goddess of Victory statue. You can take pictures as long as you don't use flash. By the time we got to the Mona Lisa, the room was crammed with several hundred visitors, each of whom were determined to get a \"selfie\" with the smiling lady. As you can imagine, the pushing and shoving got pretty intense (we were warned about this prior to the tour) not unlike trying to get into the Sistine Chapel on Easter Sunday or trying to get near the Trevi fountain at noon in Rome. They also warned us to be careful to protect ourselves against pickpockets. We had some free time after the tour ended (hello gift shop), and we decided to skip the bus trip back to the boat for lunch and head out on our own to explore Paris. We had \"brunch\" at a great little cafe just a few blocks north of the Louvre; it was called Le Pain Quotidien Saint-Honore (address: 18 place du Marche, they also have a web page!). Our selections included: wine, salad, a baguette, and Quiche Lorraine - all for 37 Euros (for two). Very picturesque, very relaxing, great food, good portions, and they had a one-at-a-time unisex restroom! They even had an English menu and the waiters spoke enough English to take our order. After wandering through Paris for another hour or so after brunch, we were able to get the Viking bus at 2 p.m. that took us from the Petite Palace to Versailles for the afternoon Versailles Palace tour. Day 8 - Versailles: We paid 79 Euros each for the Viking-provided Versailles tour. We arrived on the Viking bus around 2:45 p.m. The Palace at Versailles was huge, and the crowds were even bigger. They told us that the gardens covered 750 acres - that's big. This place was the king's hunting lodge! The reflecting pool was a mile long - that's big. The first thing you notice is gold; gold on the gates, gold on the roof, gold on the statues, and that's before you even get into the building. Once inside past the metal detectors, there is gold on all the walls, gold on all the furniture, golden clocks, golden sculptures, golden lamps, gold on the chandeliers, gold on the ceilings, gold woven into the fabrics, and the place is littered with priceless paintings and other sculptures. No wonder the starving masses staged the French Revolution. We had timed tickets for 3 p.m. and our guide got us in the door a few minutes before 3 so we were just a little ahead of schedule. Once inside, we (again) lost 20 minutes for a potty break. Then we became part of a traveling beehive of humanity that swept us along the halls and rooms like a huge mass of logs heading down a river toward a sawmill. The camera on my battery died after 300+ pictures that day, just before we got into the Hall of Mirrors, so I had to switch to my iPhone for the remainder of the day. Our tour guide described the incredibly staggering opulence enjoyed by the king, queen and several thousand of their closest friends at Versailles while we viewed the endless rooms, chambers, halls, and a chapel that looked like a small version of the Sistine Chapel. After our guided tour ended, it was \"hello gift shop\", and then we had an hour or so to visit the gardens (they required a separate Viking-provided ticket). The fountains, sculptures and reflecting ponds were endless and literally breathtaking. We noticed two soldiers carrying assault rifles while we were there; the first time for that. In Paris you will see police with pistols, some on rollerblades, some on motorcycles, most in cars, but Versailles was the only place we saw assault rifles. Day 8 - Night Tour & Eiffel Tower: The Viking bus drove us around Paris on our last night to see the Seine, and all the significant monuments, bridges, palaces and shopping districts. Then we stopped at the Eiffel Tower to disembark and watch them put on the 10-minute light show at 10 p.m. (See photo below). It was quite spectacular - definitely worth the trip, especially since we didn't visit the tower on our previous treks across Paris. The grounds around the tower were packed; similar to (but not as large as) people watching fireworks on the 4th of July at the Washington Monument in DC. It was a great way to end our trip before heading back to the ship to pack our suitcases.Bottom line: Day 8 in Paris/Versailles was \"very good.\" We finally got to see the Louvre, Versailles and the Eiffel Tower and we got to sit in a little cafe for a very nice meal and some wine. It was a very long day, but it was worth it. Too bad everything had to be crammed into one day. Day 8 was a Sunday in August, so lots of stores and cafes were closed, but enough were open to meet our needs.12. Viewing the Seine from our Private Balcony: The boat usually travels at 15 to 20 MPH with plenty of quaint villages/towns along the way. Chalk colored cliffs lined the Seine for about 25% of the trip. Occasionally we would see rail yards and industrial areas with graffiti on the walls and bridges. We passed lots of barges and a few powerboats. We enjoyed our private time on the balcony with wine and chocolate; if you don't book a room with the veranda, the sun deck is the best option.13. Language Issues: I confess, all I really know about the French language I learned from Pepe Le Pew cartoons as a child (smile). 95% of the time English was spoken fluently. Everyone on Rinda spoke fluent English. Most people that we met on the tours (waiters, shop keepers, cashiers, and museum staff) spoke English. Of course, the tour guides spoke fluent English. In one chocolate shop in Rouen the staff didn't speak English or they refused to but we still managed to get some samples and purchase \"Tears of Joan of Arc\" chocolate drops. Please note that although just about everyone speaks English, they typically have thick accents and they may not speak \"American English\" so you might have to ask for clarifications from time to time. We bought one of those \"Learn French Fast\" CD courses at Costco for $39.95 a couple of months prior to our trip, but we never got much past \"Hello, goodbye, thank you very much, please, where is the toilet,\" and counting from one to 10; and as it turned out, we really didn't need to speak French although it was fun trying. 14. Money: Bring Euros with you; except for the airport gift shop in Iceland and gratuities on Rinda at the end of the cruise, dollars are not accepted anywhere, although credit cards seemed to work anywhere. 15. Conclusion: Now it's back to work, back to a low carb diet, and I have to download 1,000+ photos and videos from my camera and iPhone and create a DVD Slideshow for posterity. I can't wait to read your assessment of Rinda after you get back from your trip. We are not planning to book another Viking River Cruise."

It was a nice way to see many famous landmarks that are located next to the Seine. The best part for me is that you could see how Parisiens enjoyed their life - we saw people having a good time, either just having a picnic next to the Seine enjoying their wine or hanging out enjoying the weather. Make sure you get on the top deck to get the best view. It is touristy but a must do for the first time visitors."

The city that we know as Paris originated on two islands in the middle of the Seine, the \u00cele de la Cit\u00e9 and \u00cele Saint Louis, which are jewels of history and architecture, from N\u00f4tre Dame to Saint Chapelle on the larger island to the beautiful 17th and 18th century houses on the smaller one.

The town is full of tourists, but a new experience, the makeshift \"beaches\" set-up along parts of the River Seine and the sandy volleyball courts in front of the Hotel de-Ville.

And I have noticed that things can heat up at night - I have noticed there are night-club like atmosphere on the some of the boats later in the evening. On the other side of the spectrum, as an early morning runner, I love to use the river as a touchstone for my runs, and hug its borders to keep track of where I am.

But kidding aside, strolling right next to the river, with the Eiffel Tower in view, how much more romantic can that be?We saw a staircase right next to the River Seine, quite a wide staircase, meant for people to sit down and relax. There were a lot of Parisians sitting there and just hanging out. There was a band of strings playing music at the bottom of the steps, and after a tiring walk in Paris, this was just the perfect setting. A place to relax and watch the boats go by or people walk by. There were some pretty cool restaurants right next to the River Seine too. Some bean bags on the floor, hopscotch, basketball hoops, just a great place to hang out with friends, family, or your lover."

The River Seine is absolutely perfect for a stroll at night particularly around the Saint Germaine and Notre-Dame areas where the nightlife is always bustling! The street performers and groups of locals gathered along the river banks is truly a spectacular sight, and a perfect time for people watching! I wouldn't suggest going on the typical cruises along the Seine, especially around midday. The blazing sun makes some people go inside the boat where it is shady, but you miss the breeze and sights you get from above - along with the burning sunlight! The cruises are also often crowded and noisy, so going at night by yourself is a much more pleasant experience."

During my veryfirst visit I mistook the dome of the Grand Palace to be that of Louvre nevertheless realized it is not what I thought it is later on. Time almost pass on unnoticeable while sitting by the side of the river and watching the tourist crowd and numerous artists paintingportraits all around. I recommend the walk in bright sunny days and also during the late afternoon its very soothing to be here. And during the evening the wonderfully lit surroundings make it even more beautiful especially with the glittering Eiffel Tower on one side or the bridges connecting both the banks of the river and lit up in the dark. The river cruises on the Seine are very nice This is a true treat to the eyes. There is also a small island on the river called la Cit\u00e9 which I could not visit due to time"

Even more interesting is to walk from around Pont Sully to Pont Austerlitz and just gaze at Parisians simply chatting and relaxing by the river bank. East of Pont Sully is a stretch of river bank where people congregate to execute different genres of dance and even take dance lessons. Another captivating spot to appreciate the Seine is from the Ile de la Cite and Ile St. Louis. Get a Berthollins sorbet or ice cream from the main outlet on Ile St. Louis and then walk around the island to enjoy the magnificence of the river. Another great view of the river is from Pont Neuf-also one of the most impressive bridges on the river."

I recently spent 4 days in Paris, pretty much all in the 1ere arrondissement and thus spent a lot of time walking along the Seine, crossing the bridges to and from the nearby attractions. Like everything else in Paris, there is loads of history and you'd do well to read up before arriving. That being said, you just have to look around to see the history, and the best time, IMO, is when there are few folks about. I was pleasantly surprised to find the walkways along the Seine pretty quiet after 10pm and downright empty at 6am. You cannot get much better atmosphere than fresh pastries at 6:15am while watching the morning barges on the river. It contrasted nicely with the normal hustle and noise of downtown Paris in July."

You need not go for the Souvenir photos clicked though as they are quite expensive.

You can see people enjoying cycle, sitting under the sun and may be even Pilate and yoga. Also you can see the beautiful bridges that cross the river. The river gives you a very different look when in the night.You would surely enjoy the city of lights."

You will take a hundred pictures before it's over. You pass the lock bridges. Views of Eiffel Tower. Incredible bridges. Sculptures. Palaces. Beautiful, colorful flowers. Just more, more, more of everything. And you don't have to walk to see it. And the angles from the boat are amazing. There wasn't any tour guide or captain talking into an intercom, which I appreciated. It was wonderful to just turn your head in 10 different directions every 20 feet, to see another remarkable sight.The boat ride took a while, and I could have stayed all day. This is an absolute MUST DO if you are visiting Paris. It offers absolutely fascinating views during the day."

However, the cruise cannot navigate too far into the city, so we took a smaller tour cruise prior to starting the main cruise the next day. It was beneficial and interesting as it pointed out many of the interesting spots always more fun via water. The River Seine is a great river to cruise on and we love river cruises through Viking, Avalon, or Uniworld. We even saw where people live on boats. The River Seine is worth a visit, especially via a week long river cruise."

We didn't have a lot of time in Paris so it was a great way to see Notre Dame, Ile de Citi and all the lovely bridges. It takes an hour and returns to where it left. Our boat didn't have drinks or anything- I saw some of the cruises had bars. It did have a WC. I was amazed at how busy the riverbanks got in the warm, summer evenings: groups of friends sitting on the banks, dangling their feet over the water, chatting, laughing; always with a bottle or two of wine in the middle. Nobody was obnoxious or misbehaving, just relaxed and enjoying life. I don't think I'll ever forget that."

It actually gives people some insight into life before roads and bridges came into being.

So, we frequently walk into Paris along its banks -- we can walk on either the left bank or the right bank. It is a great way to see Paris as long as the weather is cool. We can also take the 72 bus from Pont de Bir Hakeim to Hotel de Ville. It is the best bus route in Paris, going past every major attraction adjacent to the Seine."

It's amazing how a river that slices through a huge city like Paris, has managed to became an integral part of French culture. I'd never think of laying down a picnic basket and popping champagne at any other river, but La Seine. And it is a very pretty river, clean, with large embankments for people to sit and enjoy themselves. In that respect, it beats the Thames hands down. I've made my will."

My friend and I bought some wine and sandwiches at the ticket office area and had a lovely late afternoon ride on a beautiful sunny day. It was perfect as we had been walking all day. Later in the week, I had a business dinner on a boat on the Seine. It, too, was nice but a rainstorm and dark skies made it a little more difficult to see the beautiful sights along the way. All in all, I would recommend a ride on the Seine -- touristy but well worthwhile. The boats do not rock much at all so do not worry about getting seasick."

Paris, like many other European cities, is based around its river, which means that most of the beautiful buildings can be viewed best from the river. There are a number of boat companies, we used Bateaux Mouches, which although a bit on the expensive side, meant having a good deal of space (especially when going on one of the late afternoon boats, when most of the coach parties have departed) and a good view of the sights."

A great way to enjoy the afternoon and escape the summer hear is to visit one of the many street markets and shops (particularly around the Latin Quarter) and bring a picnic lunch of French cheese, breads and pastries, and of course some wine.

We walked most of the bridges in Paris both in the day time and at night. The lighting is so beautiful at night and taking a river boat gives you an even better view of the city. I recommend taking a river boat at night in time to see the Eiffel Tower sparkle at the top of the hour...definitely worth it! It was also wonderful to wander down the sidewalk by the Seine and poke into the various sidewalk pop up shops along the way...the artwork, the book sellers, the trinkets. There is something for everyone. We felt very safe at night walking by the river, maybe because there are always a ton of people around, but we never once felt unsafe at any hour. Be sure to catch the lights reflecting on the river from the various buildings. It makes you realize how the master painters came up with the stunning scenes they did."

            "review": "The heart of the city. Unlike most visitors we didn't sail along the Seine we walked it. We go to cities to explore them on foot and covered 103 miles in Paris so we explored both banks of the river for miles in all directions. In many places you are on the embankment in others you have to divert, like the Thames in London. It is beautiful and like many Parisian places there is a buzzing but relaxed atmosphere. There are bars and restaurants in static boats and stacks of things happening to entertain people, particularly on a weekend. It really is part of the essence of Paris. As you leave the tourist centre you come across more industrial sights, it is a working river with barges loaded with containers and building materials being a constant sight.The downside are the camps of homeless, presumably, although not entirely, migrants, in tented villages under the bridges. Anything that offers shelter will have a makeshift bed in it. The smell of urine is overpowering, even in the tourist area any corner is peed in extensively and it stinks. The migrant camps could be quite intimidating but during the day there are plenty of people around and generally the police are sat watching nearby so you just walk on by. I got some head shaking for taking photos but it was minimal, I just kept moving. Many of the people appear out of these one man tents dressed just like tourists, not the alcoholic vagrants in filthy rags. They are washing clothes and hanging them on the railings to dry.A beautiful river but there is the Seine as a tourist attraction and the Seine as a working river and a home as well, the two are very different."

Good idea to take the cruise in the evening around say 9 pm . Paris wears another look by night . All the key monuments look gorgeous at sun set . Clear Summer Blue sky with Orange sky at Sunset is magical . Key monuments of Paris are visible from the boat . Return trip , sky gets dark and illuminated monuments look amazing . Audio is helpful . You understand history behind many of the bridges on Seine .Summer weather with out biting chill makes it a thorough enjoyment ! Strongly recommend !!!!!!!"

It will give you an up close look at some of the city's iconic buildings, especially the Eiffel Tower, Notre Dame cathedral, Musee D'orsay among others. The tourist loop ride will go up and back but beware as the ride back down the Seine goes around the other side of the cathedral so make sure to get your photos of St Germain and the cathedral on the ride upriver. For extra ambience ride the river at dusk to see sundown and the city and The Eiffel Tower lit up"

It's hard to say which is best, but I'd recommmend you do both.The banks along either side are always filled with life and make great walks both during the day and at night.The various boat cruises are really relaxing and informative but you see all of the buildings along the river from a different angle than on foot but you tend to pass everything quite quickly.My preference is to walk along both banks. Some parts are far more vibrant than others, but all appear to be perfectly safe."

We used Fat Tire Tours - and they were very affordable and had exactly the dates we wanted available. Again - so many other ways to see the sights and learn about them along the Seine that I think (if we had some extra money) I would do a more upgraded boat with a small, select group of friends and rent it for the few hours. Some boats had a yacht look to them, with private table/chair seating areas, small bar, and an intimate feel. I bet you get a personal guide speaking about the sights as you sip nice wine along the Seine River.The water is not that pretty or clear - not at all.

One of the ads for the Viking Cruise from Paris to Normandy features a woman who says that the cruise was \"every bit of what they advertised.\" Too bad this isn't true! Ads for this River Cruise on the Seine show appealing shots with the Eiffel Tower in the background. But if you happen to land of the fourth boat, Rinda, you won't find yourself in Paris, but in a suburb 50 minutes away. And you won't know about this \"change\" until five days before your cruise when you'll receive an email from Viking which reads as follows: \"The port authority of Paris has unfortunately not issued the required permit to allow Viking Rinda to dock where we had planned to.\" But after speaking to other angry passengers, you will discover that Rinda has never been docked in Paris and that Viking knew all along this would be the case. One passenger who had spoken to Viking's home office learned that Rinda is too big to go under some of the bridges in Paris because of its third deck.To be fair, I can say that the food was consistently delicious and the staff engaging and entertaining. Most of the tours were well done, although the day after Normandy was a bit slow.But had I known this cruise would not be docked in Paris I probably would have changed my plans. Because by being stuck out in the suburbs of Le Pecq, you are deprived of the excitement of being in Paris and you are stuck with very long bus rides to and from the various attractions.I'm not sure I could ever consider doing another Viking Cruise after being duped like this."

Gradually, all the bridges started to lit up as the sky became darker.

Fully recommend a tour of the Seine using this company.Note our experience of the snack vending machine delivered stale produce, if our experience is anything to go by take your own snacks.

When you visit Paris and stroll along the banks of the Seine on the right bank from the Pont Marie to the Louvre, and on the left bank from the la Tournelle to Voltaire look for the Bouquinistes, book sellers. They have become one of the iconic symbols of Paris and sell old books, documents related to fashion, history, cinema, foreign writers. Their green boxes where they store their merchandise close completely when not open for buisness. Once many used books that once stood on the library shelves of the rich and powerful found their way to the stalls of the bouquinistes. They tend to buy their merchandise in clearance sales, flea markets, house clearances to keep costs down to make a living. With the internet and TV nowadays more people get their info from these sources and less people know the feel of reading a good paper back. Many will never know the comforting smell of old paper that brings back childhood memories. Many bouquinistes in order to make a living also are allowed to sell a small amount of souvenirs. On our visit there I discovered an original Beatles album for an excellent price. One vendor was also selling paintings from art students that attend an art institute in Paris. We purchased a lovely painting and now hangs in our entry hallway. My husband found a couple of paperbacks that he has enjoyed reading. So, my advise is don't pass the bouquinistes without having a look you may find that book or music album that you've search your whole life. Happy Reading!"

This tour only covers those landmarks/monuments that are by river Seine (and there are quiet some!) - of course there are some that are not on the banks of Seine, which this tour does not cover.

One can enjoy the city by taking a boat ride across the river. There are regular river cruises from near the Eiffel tower. Its about 90 minutes ride and really gives you to enjoy the city from the river. Almost all the famous landmarks are seen during the cruise. There are several beautiful bridges on the river. Its a must experience cruise and preferably during the late evening so that weather is good and one can see the city slowly glowing to its beauty."

It is worth the time and the modest cost to take the boat ride. Some of the boats are configured with obstructed views so check out the boat before you buy a ticket."

For example, If you have just visited Notre Dame and want to get to the Eiffel tower, you can get there on the BateauBus and see some great scenery on the way.

The average depth of the Seine in town is 9:5 metres.It is said that Joan of Arc's ashes at Rouen were thrown into the Seine in 1431, but no one seems to know who actually said this. Maybe a tourist.In the Summer of 2002 Paris commenced the Paris Plages (The Paris Beaches) by introducing truck loads of white beach sand along the edges of the river so that people could relax and enjoy the sunshine, improve their tan, and display their new bikini.On my 1st trip here I took the River Cruse. It took forever. You see so much more by walking along the banks.However, to conclude on a sour note; in 2007, 55 suicide and/or murder victim's bodies were retrieved from the slow flowing river.Brian, from Perth. W.

It is also lovely to take a cruise down the river which we did. Keep in mind that some cruises start at one point and drop you off at a different point. An exception are the cruises on the Seine starting next to the Eiffel Tower. They start and return to the same location. You can do a 1 hour cruise for around 14 Euros (discounts are possible from various vendors, e.g. Sandeman's New Europe Tours) or take a dinner cruise down the river. I highly recommend doing the cruise at night when you can see the lights of the city, including Eiffel Tower and Notre Dame lit up at night. Eiffel Tower is spectacular when a light show from the tower occurs every hour and lasts for around 5 minutes. It is magnificent to behold from the river."

Instead of being in Paris, docked just below the Eiffel Tower, we were docked next to a modern bridge in the small town of Le Pecq, which was 1 hour from Paris, if you were lucky. Traffic made one trip 1 1/2 hours. Instead of walking off our ship to tour Paris at 9:00AM, we got off our shuttle bus at 11:30AM. Viking lied to use as to the reason. They stated it was due to excessive rainfall and the level of the river. The truth is that the Viking Rinda has never docked in Paris, or had a license to dock in Paris. We were never informed of this at any point until we showed up for the ship at the docking location in Paris, where the ship was supposed to be, only to be shuttled off to Le Pecq."

My favorite bridge is the pedestrian Pont des Arts, although it will surely be different without the metal grill railings that were removed because of the epidemic of 'love locks,' a wonderful idea that unfortunately ran amok, in my opinion.If it is warm enough, consider shopping for a picnic lunch or supper and eating it on the western tip of the Isle de la Cite, in the park or right on the bank with your feet dangling over the edge. I am often amazed at how this spot, which is smack dab in the middle of the stressed-out city, can be one of the most serene places of all. Call it the eye of the storm.

The Boat cost about 15 Euro for a day pass with unlimited on/off options. One of the most beautiful sites is the Notre Dame Cathedral as you approach at sunset."

The River features walking trails on both sides and my husband and I were able to walk safely and see much of the river which is quite pretty, although somewhat muddy due to the spring conditions.The bridges are maintained well, but I agree with the decision to have the locks removed off of them--get a ring and where it around your neck to plight your true love."

They seem expensive but for the service we got, we were thrilled with the experience. We were picked up at our apartment and returned by private service. The food was fabulous and the wine plentiful. There was pleasant live music from a three piece band. The dinner included glasses of champagne and snacks to start. Then a appetizer course with a bottle of white wine. Then the dinner course with a bottle of red wine. We finished with a desert course and coffee.Every course was fantastic. The appetizers were four choices of things I could not relate to or identify but they tasted fantastic, which made this a great adventure. My choice was a cold soup with shrimp and almond slices and cheese. I forget what it was called but it was yummy. My wife had a warm dish that was a type of cereal, and it was also great. Such a nice adventure and we were very pleased. Then we both ordered the filet mignon for our entree and it was absolutely delicious. Cooked perfectly and tender, with a fantastic light sauce. The olive oil mashed potatoes that were served with it were also fantastic. Simple but tasty.The desert course was delicious too, but not as memorable as the previous courses. The cruise ends with a night view of the Eiffel Tower all lit up. What a finish to a very pleasant 3 hour cruise. The only thing left was a drive back to our apartment by our private driver and we slept like happy babies....I would do this cruise again anytime I return to Paris, it was that great!"

Loved our recent visit to Seine waterfront near the Eiffel Tower complex.The waterfront is filled with restaurants and small cafes that are teaming with people who come to the place just WO walk alongside the river or better still, take a scenic boat ride.We also took the 1 hour plus boating ticket, which was not too expensive considering that Seine is amongst the top attractions in Paris and one of the most sought after place by tourists.The boat ride was fun and had good views of many tourist attractions like the Notre Dame Church and the Louvre museum. On the way back, the sun had set and out came the lights at the Eiffel...made for some breathtaking views.The walk later alongside the river banks was fantastic too.Needless to say, we hope to be back someday to this lovely riverfront"

The trees lining the passageway make the stroll on a warm day all the more pleasant.But the real joy of the river comes from taking a cruise, or better yet, a dinner cruise, along its course. The river brings travelers by all of the prime sights go Paris and gives tourists views of the sights they would not otherwise enjoy. And, of course, these cruises, whether short like the one we look, or those of a more extended time, also have guides to tell the traveler what they are seeing and why the particular landmarks are important.No visit to Paris could be even half-way complete without a trip along the Seine"

The Seine by the Eiffel Tower is a completely different experience than the Seine by the Jardin des Plantes. Nevertheless, throughout all of Paris strolling along the Seine is a superb experience.I recommend:1. Walking in the Notre Dame area on the Left Bank (south) - there are plenty of little shops with books and posters2. Checking out the boat clubs and bars in the 13th arrondissement on the river3. Pont des Arts, better known as the love-lock bridge, is a great place to stroll with your significant other4. Pont Neuf is the western tip of the Ile-de-la-Cite, which is the island that Notre Dame is located on. Go to Pont Neuf on a warm night when the sun is setting. Bring some wine and snacks and you will have a great time."

It is not as important to history as the Tigris or the Euphrates. It is not as religiously important as the Jordan River.

It's a beautiful walk, we passed the 'love lock bridge' and notre dame on our way."

Sorry, couldn't find a specific entry for Paris Pass.....I opted to pick up my four-day (me) and two-day (sister) passes at the office. If I had to do it again, I would have it sent to me in the US. Lines are long outside the office in the morning, but the office staff IS helpful.The Seine River cruise was refreshing after the crowds at the Eiffel Tower, on the bus, etc. You pass under historic bridges and see the Orsay, the Louvre and Notre Dame from the water. If you step off the bus at the Eiffel Tower, walk across the street to the Bateux Parisien area and (we were told) section 3 is where you present your Paris Pass and receive your ticket to board.NB: DO NOT GO TO PICK UP YOUR BUS PASS UNLESS YOU ARE USING IT THAT DAY! I made the mistake of trying to pick up our bus passes to use several days later, but they are 'activated' for use the day you pick up the passes. Wasted trip there.If you plan to visit a lot of museums, and enjoy navigating the Paris Metro system (which is quite excellent save for the long staircases in/out) and the one-day Big Bus tour, then buy the pass. As an FYI, the Big Bus people will ask if you want a second day for only 6E more, which is a bargain. We only wanted one day, using the metro throughout our stay."

For the included tours, we chose the visit to Monet's garden was a real highlight, the taste of Normandy was excellent, the thatched cottages were good too. The cruise did not make it back to Paris, because the Seine was flooded by over two metres, and the cruise director arranged for us to be transferred to a Paris hotel, where we continued our tour. Despite this, Avalon could not have done better to ensure we had the best time possible despite the change of plans. they discounted the two days off the ship, added a optional paid tour for free, refunding the money for those who had paid for it, and bent over backwards to make sure we were taken care of. Excellent and we would highly recommend them for cruises. We will happily go with them again."

It can get quite windy on the upper deck so wear a jacket. There's lots of room and the views were fabulous. Paris has beautiful buildings and a river cruise allows you to appreciate the architecture. You can take loads of photos if you've got a good camera. On the lower deck you can hear a commentary in different languages and try to get a seat next to the window. This is a nice relaxing way to see the city."

There were definitely some awkward moments where the person sitting in front of me shifted around and his behind was resting straight on my knee. I usually like to take photos on things like this, but this is the first time I wish I hadn't. The walls along the Seine make it very difficult to get a good view of most of the buildings. Most of the time you could see the roof of what you were trying to see. If you want a view of the Notre Dame and the \u00cele de la Cit\u00e9, make sure you sit on the RIGHT side of the boat.I would still recommend going on a cruise like this - just save your camera for when you are walking around instead.

Meals were fantastic and additional alcohol can either be purchased on board or bottles can be bought on board at the different towns you stop at. All bottles have corks so at the place of purchase they will open them for you or pay a corkage fee on board.A choice of included tours were offered at each town and all were very well presented with guides from each area very informative (only one guide was over the top offering her own opinion on everything).Monet's Garden was the highlight, the day being warm and sunny at the start of spring flowers were beautiful and our tour given priority entry so not too crowded.Taking into account the cruise included your first class accommodation, fantastic meals, nightly entertainment on board, transport and the ease of entry and viewing of all the tourist attractions this cruise was very good value.We stayed in a different hotel to the Paris Pullman where you meet in Paris to join the cruise. At half the price the La Fabe was within walking distance even with our suitcases and was a nice little boutique hotel.With only 140 passengers on board this company and cruise is highly recommended."

But starting seven years ago, Parisians, or more likely Paris-smitten lovers, have been head over heels, or more likely over themselves, professing their love along the bridges of the Seine. Not that they're risking an actual plunge into the barge-stirred soup. But over these years, 700,000 couples, by one published but otherwise undocumented account, and more likely more than a million, have marked their names or initials on hardware-store padlocks. They have hooked these locks to gates along at least three bridges that cross the Seine, or to locks of older locks locked to the bridges. They have created such dense thickets of steel and brass that gates along one bridge have fallen into the Seine. Parisians evidently take this \"love lock\" phenomenon in stride as perhaps a routine expression of the hormonal ardor long attributed to them. But a few Americans, prudes perhaps or current or former tourists, have been raising alarms and urging the authorities to stop the desecration. They might succeed, so it behooves visitors to the celebrated city of love to visit theses bridges before more land in the drink."

My only criticism is... not really about the river itself but the walkway along side it. Which is fine for the most part however where it passes under bridges there is the occasional homeless set up which wasn't too bad but what was bad was the smell of urine. Which kinda spoiled the walk as you find yourself holding your breath when a bridge comes along."

There's something special about this waterway, not the least of which of course is its amazing history. Coming from Perth Western Australian where the river through the city has little commercial use, it is great to see all the commercial vessels plying their trade on this narrowish waterway, carting materials for industry and building. On our first day here we boarded a Batobus and traversed the part of the river this covers in the centre of the city, but we found the view of the buildings and surrounds hidden to a degree because of the high walls along the Seine. Still a good experience but I think we've enjoyed walking along its borders more. We also saw a lock operating at the bottom of the small port where pleasure boats are kept, and assist their entry and exit to the Seine. A special feature of this amazing city."

We took a boat cruise along the river right after going up the Eiffel tower and before that a bus ride touring the city's main attractions as part of our half day tour program. We were given a set of earphones each for the running commentary detailing what we were about to see along both sides of the river. The earphones could be cumbersome but since it was our second time on such cruise, we could enjoy looking around without being really bothered with it. It was such fun to see how much influence the river has on the city and its inhabitants. After the cruise we walked along the Seine to return to our hotel. Took us one and half hours instead of the estimated 45 minutes, because there were just too many interesting photo stops, beautiful monuments and buildings, and people watching activitiy that was just too fascinating to miss. We walked along the Seine again and afain after that basking in what it had to offer. We felt that the citizens of Paris are so lucky to have the Seine. Although it was not a crystal clear, beautiful, picturesque river, it has its charms that invites you to return everytime you are in Paris."

My husband and were just back from Paris a couple of days ago and guess what, we walked along the river hand in hand, watching the people, buildings, cafes, and the life around it- and that was simply romantic. We did it on bright afternoons with soft breeze, on majestic orange sunsets, on quiet starry evenings, and those were moments we'll not forget. Of course you can join other hundred of tourists cramming on a boat which can also be fun I am sure, but we chose to have lovely dreamy peaceful walk on ourselves admiring the view, sit down on the edge gazing at the sky, the stars, accompanied with slices of delicious French baguette, cheese and wine. We started, stopped and continued again as we wished. No queuing, no tickets, no deadline. It is for us, a true (boat-free) Parisian experience. :-)"

If you're a photographer, you might run out of digital film. If you're a couple, you might just reconnect."

We hopped on an off during the day, went back to our apartment for some wine,cheese and baguettes, then got back on the boat at about 8:30pm. This time, rather than hopping on and off, we just sat back and enjoyed the \"round trip\" at night. If you do this, you will know why Paris is the \"city of lights\"! Just beautiful and relaxing.

Still I was able to get some nice pictures of Notre Dame from inside. We did this after touring the Eiffel Tower, so a nice way to end the day."

You get basic information from the guide so maybe it's better to take the cruise in the beginning of your trip and then decide what to visit. We saw Paris by night from the Eifel tower and agreed that the cruise might be nicer during the evening. We'll defintely try it next time."

Would recommend the cruise for a photos you could get and the sites you see but the dinner I would rather find somewhere highly rated on Tripadvisor and go there instead."

Paris is filled with wonderful museums, fabulous cultural sites and activities, and history galore. But my favorite thing to do is to walk along the Seine. Or take a boat ride on the Seine. Or picnic along the Seine. Well...you get the idea. Walking the banks of this beautiful river is romantic. Ditto the picnic idea. And a boat ride allows you to enjoy all of the Seine's gorgeous bridges, each of them different. If you are on a budget, take the Bato Bus, which is your least expensive option, otherwise, spring for a dinner cruise or sightseeing tour."

            "review": "An Essential Piece of Paris. I cannot imagine Paris without the Seine. The river separates the city into two sections with six arrondissements on the Left Bank and 14 on the Right Bank. Boats regularly ply its waters, and many carry tourists, who gaze at the beautiful structures on both banks. I find evening to be the best time for a cruise when the buildings are awash in artificial light -- a truly magical sight. Myriad bridges cross the river with Pont Alexandre III and Pont Bir Hakeim my favorite connectors. Ornate Pont Alexandre displays artistic elements that include sculptures and Art Nouveau lamps. I've always been able to get excellent photos of the Eiffel Tower from here. Double-tiered Pont Bir Hakeim offers passage to Metro line 6 on the top and to pedestrians, cyclists and motorized vehicles on the bottom. From the center of this bridge, steps lead down to an artificial island on the water that features a 35-foot-high replica of the Statue of Liberty at its Western end.Les Berges de Seine on the Left Bank stretches for 1.5 miles along the river between Musee de Orsay and Pont de Alma. This recreation area for pedestrians, walkers and joggers offers a variety of things to do, from children's play areas to shipping containers that can be reserved for naps. I sometimes stop at one of the cafes for a bite to eat and to watch the passersby. To the West, Quai Saint-Bernard holds the Musee de la Sculpture en Plein Air. Visitors stroll near the water, looking at scores of sculptures by famous artists, such as Constantin Brancusi and Emile Gilioli. This same quai attracts dancers on warm nights in three amphitheatres and two esplanades. Tourists are welcome to join in the dancing -- tango, salsa, etc. -- or to simply watch, perhaps with a picnic supper.Booksellers along the sidewalk above the Seine on both banks present an iconic scene as do strollers along the water. I consider it a pleasant pastime to walk by the river in the direction of the Eiffel Tower when its lights begin to twinkle at night. More than anything else, the Seine says \"Paris\" to me."

While Paris can be associated with so many landmarks, all worth their weight in gold, the River Seine provides the mirror in which the whole city can coquettishly glance upon its beautiful reflection, especially on a warm summer/spring day, so that any person who may happen to take a furtive glance on the water as well, will for certain be enamoured. On our last trip to Paris in February, we took the afternoon river cruise with Vedettes de Pont Neuf. It was my first time to take the cruise so I braved the freezing gusts of Parisian winter wind on the second level of the boat just so I could marvel at the landmarks ahead and on either side of the river banks. La Tour Eiffel, Mus\u00e9e du Louvre, Pont Alexandre III, Pont des Arts, Notre Dame, Place de la Concorde, Grand Palais, and many more enchanting landmarks can be seen from the boat as it gently glides along the water. The cruise itself lasts for an hour or so, with the guide speaking in a combination of English and French for the benefit of the non-residents on the boat. There is a food and beverage shop at the dock, so you can buy snacks before you take the cruise. But if you're not too hungry, I suggest you skip the snacks and just go for a decadent meal and dessert at any of the brasseries cluttered around the riverbanks. The river cruise costs between 10 to 14 Euros. Though I think they have promo rates being offered depending on the season. Not to be missed when in Paris.:)"

Better to take a nighttime dinner cruise if you are with your significant other and not travelling with children. Kids like the boat, but the narration provided isn't all that good - if you do take the free boat tour provided with the Paris Pass, bring headphones and use them. Its a lot easier than trying to hold the silly phone thing to your ear. But you don't really need them - they rarely tell you anything that interesting. Go outside and enjoy the ride if its a nice day instead and take the Bus tour first - then you'll know all the sites already and just see them from a different angle."

They begin generally adjacent to the Eiffel Tower and proceed in each direction in the Seine for approximately an hour. The common sites were Notre Dame, Louvre, Eiffel Tower, Army Museum and other sites. It is recommended to try to sit in the front portion of the boat, be on the upper level or lower deck in an effort to get ideal pictures. Note - some patrons on the boat are not polite and will stand in front while taking pictures and at times there was the need to ask them to move aside. After a while it seems the \"norms\" of the conduct on the boat were adhered to by nearly all of the visitors. Would definitely do this again and/or recommend this as a way to see some of the highlights of Paris."

It has flooded. Once it was the main road in town, and because of that most of the sites worth seeing are along it. In the past I have taken water taxis and water tours and they are fine. In March 2015 I walked along it, near Notre Dame, on the left bank (left and right banks are in relation to looking downstream), with all the stalls of booksellers. I bought a worn out book of the history of the Commune, the short-lived Paris revolution after the second empire. The river flowed past."

The river tour is a lot to do with cathedrals when you can understand what the guide is telling you. We went on the big red bus tour and much preferred that so if I was to go again id save my money and not bother on the river!

We travelled through the heart of Paris and along the base of the Eiffel Tower cruising for 27 km and going through one lock. There was surprisingly little river traffic (we think as it was Saturday, a lot of the barges were not working) until we got close to the Eiffel Tower and Ile de la Cite, then the tourist boats were like flies.We managed our way around them, even when they broke the red lights on the one way system around the Ile de la Cite.

And it is a nice way of traveling for example from Tour Eiffel to Notre Dame.We bought tickets beforehand online, but there is no advantage in doing so. You still have to stand in same line to get your tickets (and there wasn't a big line anyway).Ticket is valid the whole day (16 euro's for adults and 7 for child) and you can hop on and off where you like. Time schedule is every 20-25 minutes. But we waited around 17:00 at Notre Dame to hop on again, but than had to wait for the next boat because it was crowded already. So don't use it as means of transport, only for sightseeing."

You get to enjoy champagne, white wine, red wine bottles per table but you can't take them home with you. Food is awesome, great taste, creative presentation, average portions, a little pricey.

I highly recommend it! We passed and stopped at many charming villages (which we explored with local guides and on our own) and docked for two days at Rouen before continuing toward Honfleur and then returning to Paris. You pass through a number of locks--and sometimes the river is too high to get back to the city of lights--but it's an experience that allows you to expand your vision of what this wonderful waterway means in a variety of areas to a variety of residents."

You can choose to get in the inner lane to avoid traffic and enjoy a care free walk. There are numerous tours available on boat which will take you to all the way across the heart of Paris. It is a different way of exploring the city altogether. I truly admire the musicians on the road and how they fill the air with serenity; the area along the river provides the perfect place to enjoy that.

Not only was the noise of traffic less, but there was actually a good amount of \"kid\" related things to do , at one place there was a little rock wall for kids to burn off some energy and the games and a maze painted into the pavement further down the walk. Loved it so much we went back everyday !"

From on foot viewing art offerings along the West Bank, or strolling beside pleached trees on si the Luxembourg Gardens side, to a very basic tourist cruise, or even on the train that travels along the Seine to Verseilles, the river Seine is the life-blood of Paris and should not be missed!Experience it as many ways as possible, by day and by night taking time to drink in all that it offers....cross as many of the intriguing bridges as you possibly can as you explore inner Paris. Walk along its banks to get to the Eiffel Tower.Hop on and hop off a river cruising boat, or do a round trip.Around every bend there is something to discover, from its intriguing bridges, to the numerous sculptures and memorials as well as iconic buildings that are located on its banks to experience the Seine is to experience Paris.Don't miss wandering along the lower levels of the Seine to see the amazing stone levies and ancient moorings near the Ille de St Louis, along from where the tourist ferries board!It's not necessary to spend a lot of money on a Seine cruise. You will get the same information on a no frills one as you do on spending a great deal of money on a dinner cruise.Simply enjoy; ou la la!"

It gives you perspectives on the city that are perfectly scaled for the cityscape, and contribute to the light that Paris is known for.

Most bartenders in Europe think a Martini means just the Martini & Rossi wine, could be dry or sweet (red). (UGGH!) Try Harry's. All good taxi drivers know where it is located."

The 2 currently popular groups are the dropped ring people and the fake petition girls. We've had ample exposure to them in the last 4 months.Let's start with #1. You are strolling along when you hear a clink of metal on pavement immediately followed by a person asking you if this \"is your ring\". Of course, you say no. He/she then explains that he/she just found the \"gold\" (actually brass) ring, that it is obviously very valuable, and that he will sell it to you for a fraction of its value because he/she really needs the money. Best approach - ignore him/her. Most gratifying approach - tell him/her in French that you may not be a moron, but he/she certainly is.On to #2. You are crossing the bridge (or in the Tuilleries, or in front of the Louvre, or walking along the Seine) and a couple of well dressed, earnest young women who look like college students approach and in impeccable English (slight upper class British accent) ask if you speak English. A positive answer initiates a request to sign a petition. While investigating the petition, their accomplices either rummage through your purse for your wallet or pick your pocket. The best answer to the question is \"no\" in a language other than English (Nein - German, non - French, anyo - Korean, ohi - Greek or ack - Inuktitut: all work quite well). The best answer I have seen in 4 months here was delivered by a cop on the Quai d'Orsay. He saw a group of these people on the opposite side of a generous sized mud puddle. He sped up to the puddle on his mountain bike, hit the rear brake hard, and skidded sideways into the puddle, soaking the lot of them in muddy water. It was brilliant!Forewarned is forearmed."

So you can visit a multitude of sites such as Notre-Dame then travel onto the next site. At the same time you get a good view of the city that lines the river. You are also not affected by the traffic jams that can be encountered. There are also companies who do a river tour and include a meal \u2013 either lunch or dinner. The Seine is also the place for moored restaurants and don\u2019t forget to see the 2 bridges - the Pont des Arts and the Pont de L\u2019Archev\u00each\u00e9 which have millions of padlocks (love locks) placed by couples.

Get an ice cream cone (or Gelato) and take a romantic stroll along the Seine. Enjoy people-watching, enjoy each other's company, enjoy life. There is no place on earth that is more romantic than Paris and a walk along the Seine is the pinnacle of what Paris has to offer. Enjoy the sun setting over Notre Dame and enjoy the beauty of the architecture and life that is swirling all around you. For another view of the city, a river cruise or even river dinner cruise along the Seine cannot be over-rated. Both are must-dos for a first-timer in Paris. Yes, they are touristy but they are the good type of tourist trap and they will give you a truly unique view of the city.Take your time, relax and remember that you are on holiday while you enjoy this landmark."

They played a bit of music which was nice if you weren't interested in listening to the information, however if you do want to listen to the information the music was a bit irritating and it was a struggle to concentrate on what was being said.The boat goes past all the main monuments and the information given was very informative and not at all rambly!

I was also impressed by the wine. This was the 1st all inclusive we didn't have to pay extra to get decent wine. It met or exceeded our standards 95% of the time and they were anything but stingy with serving it :) I cannot say enough about the crew. John, the cruise director was hilarious and everyone made fast friends with him. Lazlo, the ma\u00eetre d\u2019, was very quick witted and met or surpassed the level of service I require of my special events. And you just fell in love with the wait staff...Elena, Alex and Johnny were great fun! And the Captain was very charming to say the least...You were given plenty of time to see the sights on land and it was very enjoyable cruising the river. The only thing that might be considered is offering more updated entertainment in the evenings. With river boat cruising becoming more popular among younger clientele, this is necessary. And I think the older guests would enjoy it as well. Thanks to the Ama family and all the great friends we made on the trip!"

Instead, if it's a sunny day, get yourself some picnic items either from one of the many markets (eg Eglise st Gervais on Wed or Sat) or the market near the Bastille on a Sunday, and then eat your lunch by the river. In the evening, after dark, enjoy the lights by the Seine. It is wonderful strolling territory, and always plenty of Parisian life around the river at night. A camera is a must."

They sold padlocks that you put your name on and locked onto the sides of the bridges, which we did.They are also cruise boats, which are pretty good, take you down the river and show all the important site, different perspective from the water.Wonderful experience."

The pretty bridges on the river have nobody around, you get to have them all to yourselves, with the old palaces, churches, towering buildings all around you. It's such a fulfilling experience.

This is the most enjoyable way to explore Paris for us: we always find something unexpected. We usually start at Jardin de Plants and walk the quays of Seine up to the Effel Tower; it is a long walk but nothing could be compared with it. It the best way to enjoy total harmony and elegance of the City of Lights passing Ile de La Cite with magnificent Notre Dame, lovely Jardin de Tuileries, the Louvre, all the beautiful bridges, the Invalides, and finishing the walk at the Eiffel Tower. It so much fun to watch Parisiens, street artists, tourist crowds. I love it in the rain and on a sunny day - always delightful. We also took a boat trip once to see the bridges at night and it was spectacular. I hope to be back in Paris in 2015 (we try to go there every two-three years) and enjoy my favorite stroll again."

There's nothing like driving at night by the river, driving passed the conciergerie, louvre, then orsay, pont Alexandre, then suddenly catch a glimpse of the sparkling lights of the Eiffel tower from afar.

While the Seine is unlikely to be a source of water for anyone in Paris anymore, it's serving different roles today. Commercial river traffic continues with barges of different sizes continuing to ply up and down the river, tourists can enjoy a sightseeing cruise to see the various landmarks and bridges, the banks of the river allow for a nice stroll or a relaxing lie-down. Paris has done a good job of incorporating all of these things to help the Seine continue to play a significant role in the life of the city. The city also feels different depending on which part of the Seine you're along. In the middle of town around the Ile de la Cite, it's historic and regal with a grand cathedral and palaces. Near Pont d'Iena, it's more a celebration of life with views of the Eiffel Tower and the Palais de Chaillot. And there's a more working class environment near the Pont National."

Boats usually go every half hour but check the times as they vary depending on the season...Also if you finish up nearing lunchtime - a lovely restaurant nearby (just at the side of the Louvre) is called: http://lefumoir.com/wordpress/.Last thing - there are other boat companies that do this trip at night whereby you can dine while doing the tour (no guide of course)....Enjoy!

Our holiday in Paris included a river cruise, we managed to get a seat on the top deck a good position if you want to take photos.The view of Paris from the river was fantastic.,The tour lasted around an hour and a half,and you certainly see a different view of Paris. Unfortunately for us that day there were a lot of noisy youngsters on a school trip and they never sat still for two minutes ,they were not in the least bit interested in the sights ,what a waste.We couldn't really hear much of the commentary either, but the weather was so nice and the scenery brilliant it was well worth doing the cruise."

Wife and I who are in our 70,s stayed with my son at Suresnes for 1 week and traveled into centre of Paris on a daily basis using the tram Metro and RER We purchased a 7 day Navigo pass costing 26 Euros each which was invaluable when travelling around and saved lots of time from queuing for tickets. Be sure to take a passport size photograph when buying the Navigo.I would advise you also purchase a reasonably sized transport system map since it is difficult to read and confusing to follow the small travel guide maps You can obtain a Lecture Confort Paris transport map at the major stations covering the whole of Paris segregating the Bus, RER ,Metro and Tram systems which is easier to follow.We initially found it difficult to follow the systems when changing from one to the other .You will generally find a sign at the system entry point outlining the directions of travel and this is duplicated on the platform.We found it easier to establish the terminus points on our route to establish the platform and then check the actual stations on the platform sign .This ensures you are on the correct platform We purchased a 6 day Museum pass for 69 Euros each which was also a good investment since it gave us access to about 20 Museums or places of interest and we had no problems in queuing for access.We found most of the museums very comprehensive and large in size necessitating more than one visit making the museum pass invaluable for repeated access.Take the museums at a leasurely pace and appreciate the architecture as well as the exhibitsWe tried to spend half a day walking round a museum stopping for a snack at lunch then walked around the various districts of Paris in the afternoon before travelling back later in the day .Avoid the rush hour or you will finish up packed like sardines in the transport systemWe generally bought sandwiches , fruit and a drink in the supermarket for lunch and sat in one of the many parks at lunchtime.The warnings about pickpockets displayed everywhere must be taken seriously ,avoid all people with billboards,be alert at all times and ensure you have zips on all you coat pockets,carry a money belt if necessary and only sufficient cash for the day.We were almost caught out on our last day when entering a metro train when a girl tried to stand between myself and my wife and obstructed my attempts to pass her .Fortunately I had a Liverpool sense of humour and I took hold of her hand and suggested we have the next dance .This unerved her and she rapidly moved up the carriage and exited at the next stop Paris is a fascinating city and we will be going again in 2015"

We booked a daytime river cruise tour from our hotel concierge and enjoyed it so much we decided that we had to come back that very same night to see it all over again at night. It did not disappoint us and was fantastic! It was so romantic and different at night along the entire river banks. The Eiffel tower at night is great to see all lighted up and then hard to believe that it could be even better when it twinkled on the hour with a fantastic display of lights! Do this as a must both tours - day and night. We also recommend having your picture taken by the photographers ours was a real treasure for us. I guess because we enjoyed ourselves so much that it really showed in the pictures - we all thought (four of us) that we looked at least ten to fifteen years younger! It was worth the money!"

There are a number of places on both the right and left banks where you can get right down to the walkways that run alongside the Seine and you can walk along the Seine. The walking surfaces are not always that good so be cautious. The alternative is to watch the flow of boats and barges on the Seine from one of the many bridges that link the right and left banks of the city of Paris. The Seine is a busy working river and you will see lots of tourist boats and barges making their way up and down the river.

So standing in line with hundreds of anxious tourists made me feel slightly homicidal. getting on a big tour boat sounded like pure unshirted hell. But actually, once we got going, I didn't even notice the other people. I actually liked Paris at night from the Seine. I didn't like Paris in general but seeing it at night from the river was a very cool experience. I would highly recommend it- but maybe find a smaller boat with less people."

It's apparently completely hit or miss on the crowds though. I read in advance about how important it is to line up early in order to both get the best seats and sometimes even be able to board, but we were there for the 9:30 cruise on July 31st and barely the entire top of the boat was full. I recommend sitting on the right side and close to the front even for the best views.It was magnificent seeing all the people lined up along the river in the various groups having mini parties up and down the river. It looks like so much fun!! There was everything from lounging couples to full on club party atmospheres with music and dancing.During the day, the river is lined with vendors and little spots to sit and relax with a snack or drink."

The Bateau Mouches are interesting to observe and many of the main sites of Paris are along its banks.This year, I took part in the run from the Eifel Tower to Versailles which involves running along the river to Issy. It was a delight. We also went for several walks along the river, which is really the thing that holds Paris together. It meanders greatly and always seems to be changing direction. A good place to view the river is from the top of the Eifel Tower"

Monet's house and gardenswe're much more impressive than I had expected, Rueon was impressive and the light show on the Cathedral was just amazing, never seen anything like it. You can see it on YouTube but it doesn't come close to the live experience Normandy, Omah Beach and the American cemetery, what can one say....Also, I have to say we were blessed with just perfect weather 70/80f during the entire cruiseThe passengers were mostly seniors, nice group. Piano music every night, a few nights they had local entertainment.We had a French Balcony which was very comfortable but not muchroom to spare.All in all I would highly recommend this cruise."

As we cruised the Seine we had wonderful views of the Limestone cliffs towering above us and the beautiful homes that line the small villages. We stopped in Giverny and went to Monet's home and visited his gardens. We sailed down further and stopped in the town of Rouen. We did a walking tour of the town and visited the location where Joan of Arc was burned at the stake. At night they have a spectacular animated light show that is shown on the facade of the Gothic Notre Dame Cathedral. We visited the Normandy beaches (very touching and moving) and then started back to Paris. Along the way back we stopped at Les Andelys and visited the ruins of the Castle Chateau Gaillard. Built by Richard the Lionheart in 1196. Even in ruins its an imposing structure guarding the Seine.As for the Ship. We were on the Viking Spirit. The accommodations are on the cramped side but other wise very comfortable. The ship was kept clean. The lounge area was very comfortable The staff on the Viking Spirit was over the top nice and always helpful. My wife and I would definitely do this river cruise again."

Most go from Pont Neuf and upstream as far as the Eiffel Tower and back down around the Ile De La Citie. The cruise lasts 1 hr and is good value. One tip though. Don't have a beer in the bar while waiting. 10 Euros for a demi!! Take your own."

The food was excellent - especially the 4 course dinners with an endless supply of a choice of wine. The highlight of the cruise was the passage through the floodlit centre of Paris with the flashing lights on the Eiffel Tower. Other places visited during the week included Monet's garden at Giverny, the Sevres porcelain factory, Conflans Ste Honorine (with a fabulous chapel in a converted barge) and other wonderful towns and chateaux in the Paris environs. The boat is a converted barge with 25 cabins, bar, library and lounge and plenty of comfortable outside seating. It would make many 5 star hotels look insignificant. Thoroughly recommended."

We chose to take the cruise on our anniversary and we brought our own bottle of wine with plastic wine glasses on board with us. Sitting out on the open deck and sipping our rose wine was an experience not to be forgotten. Although you might be thinking, cheap plastic wine cups??? Trust me, the view, the ambience, the company more than makes up for it.The cruise was a wonderful reprieve from the rush of getting through all of Paris's sights. For a heavenly hour, it was just me, him, the wine and Paris. The cruise covers many of the major attractions from the outside. I saw the Louvre, part of ile de la cite, the Musee d'Orsay, the bridge of lovers...If you're planning to do the cruise in the winter, a really warm coat, gloves, scarf, wooly hat and ear muffs are a must to prevent freezing to death!

            "review": "Seine Cruise, Paris-Normandy on Avalon's \"mv Creativity\". Leisurely sailing down the meandering River Seine (pronounced 'Senn') and back, was just so luxurious on the \"m.v. Creativity\" in Avalon Waterways' 10th anniversary year. The food and beverages, accommodation appointments, service, ship administration (especially that of hardworking tour director Janoz and his efficient staff), on-board entertainment and shore excursions were nothing short of superb. Passage through the locks gave us a singular appreciation of just what engineering feats it must have taken to construct them, and the skill it must take to negotiate them. The passing scenery was generally so pleasing on the eye, as urban residential, commercial and industrial communities were, by and large, successfully screened from view by thick vegetation growing down to the riverbanks. European white swans glided along the waterway with teal and mallard ducks, moorhens and other waterbirds adding fauna interest, besides the various pleasure craft and working barges with their ubiquitous little family vehicle parked on the aft deck, to our stately journey. The dozens of moored houseboats gave us an idea of just how vital this waterway was to communities along the way. Picnickers and fishers along the banks gave friendly waves as we glided past, our wake drifting without rancour towards the shoreline. Scheduled ports of call at Vernon (for a visit to renowned artist Claude Monet's extensive gardens and chateau at Giverny) and Rouen (where the maid-soldier Jeanne d' Arc was gruesomely burnt at the stake) for optional coach trips to the Normandy landing beaches of WW11, the coastal town of Honfleur, the historical tapestry at Bayeux, St Therese Basilique at Lisieux, or the delightful mediaeval village of Beuvron en Auge with cider and calvados tasting at a local distillery, gave those who participated, exciting adventures to savour and over which to reminisce. Back at Rouen, home to the maritime tide known as \"le Mascaret,\"a highlight of one night was to join the assembled crowds to experience the imaginitive son-et-lumiere projected onto the ornate front of Rouen Cathedral, the clever illuminations augmented by realistic audio broadcast through loudspeakers mounted nearby. On the return journey back up the Seine, stops at the twin towns of Les Andelys - Grand Andely and Petit Andely (giving energetic hikers the chance to climb up the white chalk cliff to view the ruins of Richard the Lionheart's Chateau de Gaillard fortress) and Conflans, where exploring up and down the serendipitous winding streets augmented a visit to the unique \"Bateau Chapelle Je Sers\" (a former barge fitted with stained glass portholes now serving as a church that ministers to seafarers )at the quayside, gave visitors regional town experiences quite different from the sophisticated attractions of Paris. At the famous City of Love, optional tours to Napoleon and Josephine's intriguing Chateau Malmaison or the tiny village of Auvers-sur-Oise(where Vincent van Gogh spent his last tortured months) presented dramatically contrasting choices. Our uninterrupted views of the illuminated Eiffel Tower and its hour-on-the-hour twinkling phenomena from the aft deck of our moored vessel, were pure-gold moments to behold. On our final night aboard, our group of revellers was skilfully manoeuvred by coach through the fascinating streets of Montmartre to sample the sybaritic delights of the Moulin Rouge of Henri Toulouse-Lautrec fame. Our delightful riverine odyssey came to a close with regret the following morning. We took a taxi (a charge is curiously made from where Paris taxis are when drivers receive the booking to where you board the vehicle, like an extra flagfall even before you begin the journey to your destination) to our city hotel, our sanctuary for a couple of days before embarking on the long journey home."

Some little beaches are filled with umbrellas and sun bathers, whilst on other banks there are socials and even dances happening. Friends sit along the walls playing board games or just chatting, and there are house boats and restaurants and even floating gardens. This was a super way to see part of Paris AND get from one side of the city to the other whilst relaxing."

The point of going to the river within the heart of Paris is that it helps to put the rest of Paris into perspective. It gives you light, or a clear view of the night sky.... It also gives you unrivaled views of much of Paris. The sides of the Seine are perfect for walking, running, dancing, skating, or taking children to climb, jump or ride bikes. Depending where you go you will always see something of interest - a pop-up dj with a small following, a busker, a temporary bar or waterfront juggler and of course an endless array of beautiful bridges, statues, the (other) statue of liberty, the Paris plage, exhibits of green living, bio foods etc etc. In winter, it makes a great place to escape the crowds. And if you happen to be outside of Paris it's edges also become a wonderful green space. Don't assume you can just 'do' the Seine, and cross it off your tourist list; it takes time to get to really appreciate all it has to offer (just as Paris does). And for those who have commented somewhat negatively that it is 'long', please go back to basic principles! This is not a tourist attraction in itself, it is a river that just happens to provide a whole range of fantastic activities and viewing points in an already beautiful city."

On the south side, there were fantastic recreation spots, dotted along, with equipment for working out / playing, cool boxes to climb on, games and mazes painted into the pavement, swing ball tennis to play,boats etc to look at. On the north side, a little further along, is the Paris Plage. Tons of sand have been shipped in and there is a whole section of mist things, which are great to play in / get sprayed by on a busy hot day. Free buckets and spades, deck chairs etc there for borrowing, as well as coffee, ice cream and beer!!!"

I would suggest the inexpensive Vedettes cruise if you want to be ON the water; but to walk the banks or on the streets with the vendors/kiosks is so much more fun, interesting, informative...and Parisiene. When possible, we would take the bus around Paris and always try to find ourself near the Seine for a busstop..we would use the Seine as the \"center point\" and branch out from there....it also was great that way because you could never get lost, always knew that if you walked enough in one direction, you would end up at the Seine."

You could walk on the pavement and admire the displays of paintings, old books, souvenirs. You could also see the boats passing. You could enjoy the monuments on either bank of the river. Take a bateau-bus instead of metro and enjoy the fresh cool breeze and the view to visit the monuments along the river. Go for a river cruise by bateau-mouche in the evening or at night when all monuments are lit. As the boats with floodlight pass by if you are on the bank you can see the monuments come alive with the light. If you happen to be near Notre Dame when such floodlight falls on the gargoyles and the towers of the cathedral, you will see the cathedral plunge again in an eery darkness as the boat passes away. You could also enjoy each bridge. Le pont des Arts with all the cadenas - the locks, the wooden bridge, the grandeur of Pont d'Alexandre... You could also go down the steps and be closer to the river and walk along in some places. Go down in Ile de la Cit\u00e9 and visit the tip of the \u00eele. You could even plan a small picnic there."

We fancied a return trip to the Seine, which we had visited several times by car, so decided to do it the easy way by taking a cruise with Croisieurope. They offered a seven-night cruise on the MS France, with optional excursions at various calling points, with the opportunity to visit the locations under our own steam: this meant that we could stay aboard, in a comfortable lounge, with a free bar, if the weather should make a visit unattractive.We crossed to Paris by Eurostar, then took a taxi to the berthing quay - as this is some distance from the Gare du Nord, the taxi fare was 35 Euros. We boarded at 6.30 pm, and our luggage was collected by a crew-member, and taken to our cabin, then we had a welcome/information meeting, followed by dinner. Tables are allocated for the duration of the voyage, and we shared with two delightful ladies from the Midlands and a younger lady from Los Angeles. Except for passengers who have special eating needs, there is no choice of food, but we were very pleased by the quantity and quality of the offerings. Wine and water are served with lunch and dinner . We then had a scenic cruise through the lights of the city, and returned to the berth.On Day 2, breakfast was a little chaotic, and the location of our table adjacent to the toaster, the egg-boiler and various other food items gave us particular problems. There was an optional city tour, which we had booked (as we had only visited Paris on about 60 occasions), and we were shown features which we had not seen before. This was the only excursion we joined. The afternoon was free for passengers to visit the city individually.Subsequent calls were at:Vernon, for optional excursions to Monet's house and gardens at Giverny;Duclair, a smallish town, affording an optional excursion to the \"Abbey trail\", visiting several historic buildings;Honfleur, one of the most picturesque cities in France, with the opportunity to visit the invasion beaches;Rouen, with an optional guided walking tour of the city;Les Andelys, for an optional visit to a couple of Chateaux - not much appreciated by our dining companions, who opted for the experience. The ship berthed at Petit Andely, which has an interesting church and a ruined castle.We thoroughly enjoyed the cruise: service was extremely good in all departments, the food was interesting and good, the lounge was large and comfortable, and offered the free bar and a variety of activities at night and during the day when the weather was bad. Mike, in charge of the Reception desk, was a tower of strength - no problem beat him.http://www.croisieurope.co.uk/On the last day, we had to leave our cabins by 09.00, Mike told us that we could wait in the lounge until we were ready to leave, and he arranged for a taxi to pick us up for the journey back to Gare du Nord.Bad points:The cabins are not capacious, but they are clean and comfortable, with two large picture windows in ours.Cabins on the lower deck are reached by winding staircases, which caused difficulty to some passengers, one of whom had to descend backwards.All of the general facilities are on the upper deck, so it is best to request a cabin there, to avoid the continual need to climb and descend the staircases."

Tired of the metro, which is a great way to get around but not what you'd call scenic, we walked to the river intending to buy two day passes on the batobus (hop on/hop off, 8 sites along both banks of the Seine). Comically, everyone we asked for the location to buy the tickets directed us to one or another of the \"tour\" cruises, so we ended up strolling briefly through Ile de Cite and walking back and forth between Pont Neuf and Pont Marie several times on both sides of the river (getting sand in our shoes but thoroughly enjoying the people watching at Paris Plage in the process). It was fun, just not the fun we had planned for the morning. We started out ignoring the petition girls, and ended up laughing uproariously every time one approached us; and, we kept count: 25 petition girls (and a couple of boys) in between 10 and 15 minutes at Ile de Cite between Pont Neuf and Pont Au Change. It was almost disappointing when we only drew a 1/2 dozen while sitting on a bench later, near L'Orangerie. Don't they know the whole world is on to their scam by now? Finally bought tickets to the right bateau (near Pont Louis Phillipe, on the Paris Plage side) and floated back to the Lions Gate to spend to afternoon in Jardin du Tuileries (and decide not to spend a couple of hours in line at Mus\u00e9e de l'Orangerie before buying a Museum Pass). Used our tickets again the next day to float more of the river. Floating on the Seine w/o a tour guide jabbering in one's ear... bliss!"

At the street level, we enjoyed the view of the river, the beautiful architecture of the buildings and bridges from near and far. Everywhere we turned, there was something interesting to see. Walking at the river level and by river cruising, we saw a different view of the river. The buildings along the river were partially obstructed at that level, but we were able to appreciate the different bridges along the river. We saw the beautiful details of bridges like Pont Alexandre and Pont Neuf, and discovered some interesting statues by the bridges, that we couldn't see from the street level. Strolling at the river level, it was very peaceful away from the traffic and busyness of the city. Also at the Ile de la Cite, we discovered a beautiful peaceful park at the western tip of the island.From the cruise boat, we were able to enjoy the view of the Ile de la Cite, with the stunning Notre Dame. And enjoyed the sights leisurely.On the double decker bus, we appreciated different views of the river as we were raised from the street level. The sights are more spectacular at sunset as the sunlight changes the visual perception of the colour of the buildings, bridges and the river."

The scenery is remarkable and so beautiful. The cruise sails through the river slowly where you can catch a good but different view on the major landmarks in Paris, such as the Eiffel Tower and Notre Dame Cathedral, museums, monuments and statues etc. But you are not standing at the foot of the Eiffel now but it is \"behind\" you as the cruise sails as your backdrop and so its a good photography spot. What romantic it is when you are photographed with your loved ones.The water in the river is clean and crystal clear. The cruise will pass through several bridges, with people waving at you! One of the bridges is the Pont de Arts (Lock Bridge), where you can find many people here, especially couples who come here to put a lock to symbolise their love. The feeling is nice and so heart warming.We took the cruise at mid-day as part of our group tour itinerary and despite of the sun, its not warm at all. You can choose to sit inside or go out of the deck to enjoy the breezes. We believe the scenery will be even nicer and more beautiful in the evening from the lightings of the buildings.If you are visiting the Louvre Museum, why not take this cruise as it is nearby and offer you a different experience and taste of Paris, the most romantic city in the world! You will not regret it but have sweet memories!"

I think it would be impossible to visit Paris and not at least see the Seine as you pass from one district to another, as there are bridges every several blocks. We have never been on one of the tour boat rides that so many do while in Paris, but you can experience it in so many other ways without leaving the banks. Whether on foot (strolling, jogging or running), roller blades, roller skates, bikes, pedi-cabs, you-name-it, you can follow it either side at street level or down at water level for miles and pass so many well-known sights, up close or even at a distance. Had it not been so hot when we were there, I would have gone for a run along the lower promenade close to the water level, which by my eye looked as though you could do for miles without having to stop. Additionally, there are hundreds of little kiosks along the length at street level that sell every imaginable item, not to mention cafes to sit, eat and look out across the river's beautiful panorama. This is a must-see, as if anyone really needed encouragement!"

I recommend Vedettes du Pont-Neuf, as this was a great way to see the city lit up and to get some great pictures.

It 's worth seeing both in daylight and after the sun goes down for a different perspective. In addition to walking, I recommend taking a one hour boat cruise (as opposed to the hop on/off Batobus service). There are many companies that do this sightseeing cruise and most seem very similar. After spending a lot of time trying to compares the different companies online, I just chose one that was recommended by the hotel. As far as timing, I recommend a night cruise that starts about 30 minute before sunset. That way, you can get some pictures with good lighting and also see the Eiffel Tower sparkle. You will be sharing the boat with a hundred other people but it still manages to be very romantic."

You will also see Paris life along the river bank - couples walking, people eating lunch, children playing - it is almost another world along the river below the city streets - much more quiet and peaceful.

For couples - and more - this is not only a romantic voyage on the Seine, but also a sightseeing through some of the heartland of the city. Good food and more than enough to drink gives a thumbs up, however, the announcements - in English - was too few. A tip to the people running these cruises would be to tell more about history and buildings throughout the cruise. The live music was allright, but from my point of view as a tourist I would like to have some more information during the sightseeing. As for the music, I could always find a place to buy some romantic French music for my wife."

And of course you walk past so many magnificent iconic buildings in Paris too!There is also the wonderful bookshop Shakespeare & Co where so many of the great writers of the twentieth century used to gather. Allow time if you are a booklover.Or walk along the lower embankments alongside the Seine where the locals are walking, fishing, jogging or soaking up the sunThere are the very touristy boats which are great for first time visitors \u2013 in fact a must \u2013 and also provide good transport to get to the various main scenic attractions that are close to the Seine"

This meant we got to see the Eiffel Tower lit up as we returned. It is also fun to walk over the Seine, and see all the lovers' locks, and read the messages.You can walk down by the river, and we saw that on summer evenings, people bring blankets, and picnic by the river, or enjoy refreshments and relaxing with each other.The one negative of the boat ride was the annoying people who were noisy, or jumped up to photograph each other with no regard to the other tourists, but that is no fault of the cruise."

There were also activities along the way, drawn on the pavement or wooden benches to balance along, as well as watching all that was going on around us. This was my favourite part of our day trip to Paris."

I do NOT recommend dinner cruise, because you don't want to try to eat while watching the scenery. In Paris, dinner is a romantic affair, so focus on dinner and enjoy the food and great French wines and the conversation. Do the evening cruise to enjoy this amazing city of lights. Get your camera ready for some photo opportunity."

Bata Moucheaux and Bato Parisienne are companies that i have used and both were equally good3.

We had a cruise included in our package so we headed to port de la Bourdonnais and were on our cruise within minutes. We marveled at the numerous beautiful bridges, the amazing architecture and the sights we had only read about mere days before.

Take a boat cruise that lasts about an hour to rest your feet and enjoy all of the buildings along the way. Summertime in Paris brings throngs of people to the river so be very alert for pickpockets who prey on the tourists. Also, I must caution you about a couple of common scams you may encounter. First is what we call the \"clipboard girls.\" They are VERY AGRESSIVE and will pester you for blocks pushing their clipboards in your face trying to get you to sign a sheet of paper that resembles a survey or petition of some sort. While you may be tempted to sign their form to get them to stop harassing you DO NOT SIGN anything. We were told this is committing you to a financial donation or something to get you to give them money. The best defense is to pretend you do not speak English when they ask you at first. Another scam to be aware of involves coins or a gold ring that the person alleges that you \"dropped.\" They appear to be poor and humble expecting that you will give them money to reward them for returning the item. While we, fortunately, were not a victim to this scam, several others on our tour were approached. Be careful! We heard that if you take the ring and do not give them money they become extremely aggressive which could easily escalate into a hostile situation threatening your well-being. The police do nothing to protect visiting tourists, so be cautious when approached by anyone. Do not stop to engage them- keep walking away is your best defense here."

In addition a stroll along the banks is de rigeur and parts of the river certainly are romantic by night. By day one can also browse through the sidewalk vendors near the Ile de la Cite to see the old books, comic books, and other types of documents that draw all sorts of collectors. My favorite method is to join a guide for a walking tour along the most historic stretches. There are floating restaurants running day and night."

The cruise is inexpensive and the timing is very flexible. The cruises run from 10 am to 10:30 pm everyday, and the duration is an hour long. The breathtaking scenery is well worth it!"

The excursions were delightful, and we were surprised to see the amount of beer wine that was provided by the ship without cost during meals.

Parisiens were sitting by the side of the river picknicking & drinking and just enjoying the beautiful afternoon. It was very windy above deck but a fantastic view, but also a great view from our seats too. The history, the architeture of the beautiful old building , the atmosphere just picture perfect. on our return it was dusk and watching the sun set in the Northern Hemisphere a first and unforgettable sight. We saw an enormous chandelier lit from its window in one of the Museums along the Siene and the locks that glistened from the bridge at dusk were enchanting... Do not miss the opportunity to cruise down the Seine there is an array of different modes and prices and a dinner cruise would be wonderful as well."

We took a taxi to the Eiffel Tower, walked around and then got tickets for this boat to take a quick ride down the river and exit at Champs Elyesee. The cruise is relaxing, takes around 10-15 mins between stops and you have to wait for passengers to get on and off, but if you are not in a hurry and want to get a quick boat ride and taxi service to your next sightseeing stop, this is a good way to go. There is no commentary - and that is made clear when you buy your tickets so I do not understand why people are complaining here. It is a ferry service - not a sightseeing boat! Bateaux runs sightseeing boats and they are much more expensive if that is what you are looking for.If you want a leisurely way to get to different points, this is a great way to go. TIP: Warning though, the boat has fixed closed windows and mid to back of boat is extremely HOT and sweaty. We stood outside on the back - but I could imagine in the summer the ride is grueling, so beware of that. When we got off the boat at our stop we noticed that towards the front of the boat there were air conditioning blowers right behind the captains station. Not sure if all the boats had it, but don't race to the rear of the boat as we did when we go on, see if the AC is on in the front and it'll make for a much more comfortable ride."

We booked a Seine River dinner cruise for 4 and paid $1137.59 total, the boat was very nice but all it did was motor us a tiny canal sort to say and see some of the famous buildings, Honestly the whole time I kept thinking OK we could have eaten at a really nice restaurant and the took a private limo and saw the same thing for less. I was not impressed to say the least. When you book one of these river cruises you will remember what you read here and think OMG he was right, don't get me wrong its not horrible, its just average but NOT worth the dinner price we paid to sit in the front of the boat."

You're at the front of the boat with lots of room, unrestricted views and in my opinion, a much better service with more food/drinks. We were given a glass of champagne when seated, followed by a glass of white wine with our starters. A bottle of red wine is then yours to drink as you please. The food was lovely and the service was great, there was a really nice atmosphere at the front of the boat. Not the cheapest way of having lunch in Paris, but if you're wanting to do a cruise I'd highly recommend booking a river cruise on the Seine with lunch."

Over the centuries, it's natural banks have been replaced by stone embankments and quays, and at this point in the city, it's more of a wide canal. However, La Seine is arguably the most famous urban river in the world and is not to be missed! I believe the river is best experienced while leisurely strolling along its banks. I like to take the stairs at Pont Saint-Michel and walk along the river bank as it parallels Quai des Orfevres. A good part of the walk is shaded by a line of trees and is dotted with numerous benches. I prefer to sit on the edge of the stone embankment and let my feet dangle down the side. Enjoy the river's cool atmosphere and the numerous bateaux as they cruise on by. And don't forget to bring a little something to eat and drink. Walk on down to Pont Neuf and enjoy the pretty little park at Square du Vert-Galant. A small point to remember is that the late-night revelers sometimes use the walkway under the bridges as a toilet so it's best to step lively when passing through."

We have been on several Seine cruises and are particularly fond of the evening trips. The river becomes quite magical with the many lights. Seeing the Eiffel Tower strobe lights from the water is wonderful. We also decided to put an eternal lock of love on the Pont Neuf. This is a fun activity and you can buy a lock from one of the many vendors along the riverbank. Some of the bridges are completely covered in locks which in the sun makes them glitter.

I nor any member of my family will return to paris ever. This year I took note of how big a cesspool paris is. Just booked a two week holiday to Switzerland, lucern, to be exact, the choice was easy, Switzerland is beautiful and guess what, No Toilet Charge. Paris you need to class it up a lot or eventually the new generation will not stand for your classless actions. We r not cattle so stop hearding people, and your bread sucked, not sure what you have left to advertise.

Be careful with your belongings. 3 girls approached for me to sign what was obviously a bogus petition and came rather too close. I had my handbag well held. Other than that it was a beautiful walk."

Grab whatever crepe concoction that you want and walk along the river walk with it. At 11pm there were a few people around doing the same thing along with a few bikers. We started from the Eiffel Tower and walked down 1.5 miles to the Pont des Invalides bridge and back. It was great!

We shared differing opinions on certain aspects of the trip, but I will focus on mine. We had a top floor suite, and by far the best view from the boat. The outside wall of our room was a large sliding glass door, so our view, docked and moving, was spectactular. We did not have a balcony, but would not have used one if we had one. The ship's engines are running 24/7 and the unpleasant diesel fumes are unavoidable with the doors open. The little time we spent in our room was to prepare for our next excursion and to sleep. The ship traveled at night and as the Seine has 6 locks to navigate, along with limited habitation on the banks of the river, there is little to see. Also, the ship docks at spots along the river that are for convenience, not for prime views. If you remain on the boat during the day there are commom areas for better views and comfort. The room itself was the most efficient use of space I have ever experienced. Closet space and storage was plentiful. Even with a king size bed we could move about in our room. The bathroom and shower was also quite spacious for one person at a time.The food on the ship was plentiful and of more than sufficient variety. I never left the dining area hungry. However, I have to say I was somewhat disappointed, as I was not always satisfied with the taste of the food. It often lacked flavor. As the week progressed, we began to see the previous days food recycled, and frequently not good. I ate a great deal of salad, and pasta with sometimes only butter, salt and pepper. I need to add that my husband was very satisfied with the food.The cleanliness was excellent. Our suite, the dinng areas, and the rest of the ship was spotlessly clean.In the beginning of the cruise our staff was courteous, and as the week progressed they became very friendly. The cruise director explained that this was the first sailing of the season with this specific crew. The performance put on by our crew at the end of the week was a great deal of fun, and reflected the personalities of the staff, as we had come to know them.Our cruise director was impressively professional, attentive and kept us well informed of the events and schedules. We had a considerable amount of confidence in her ability to mange any and all aspects of our experience both on and off the ship. Even when one of our tour bus was tied up in traffic for an hour and a half, she was there to greet us with a cheerful welcome, and helped everyone find a way to look at the experience from a humerous perspective.We had two options for excursions each day, and we could also change our minds the day before. The excursions were well planned and delightful. We were happy with all of our excursions. The motor coaches supplied for transport were of good quality and very comfortable. All but one excursion required transportation to the site. Be prepared therefore to spend more time in transport than you might have expected. Rounding people up, getting them on and off the bus was often time consuming, and cut into our time actually spent at the venue. That aspect was disappointing, especially when we arrived at the WWII museums, beaches and cemetary. A full day trip, starting earlier in the day, and returning for only a light evening dinner would have been preferable.The people you meet on the crusie also make it uniquely special. We talked to many couples from a variety of countries and locations. Finding couples close to our age and also our energy level was challenging. We were informed by our travel agent in advance that this might be the case, based on the specific destination of our cruise (WWII memorials). Two couples we really bonded with, while playing cards and a fun dice game during our evening crusing, expaned our social experience, making the entire trip so much more fun. We still communicate with them since our trip.This was our first and only cruise. In terms of cost, this was a very expensive trip. Gleefully, my husband and I both found it to be the trip of a life tiime and well worth the money.The overall Seine River cruise was wonderful and we plan to take another river cruise in the future. This was our first and only cruise"

We had beautiful weather during our stay which made this option more enjoyable. Highly recommend to get another view of Paris!"

Overall we were extremely pleased with the service we received on the MS AmaLegro. Our suite was nicely furnished and there were a fresh fruit tray and a couple of bottles of iced champagne waiting for us. There are four suites on this particular ship, and all are identical. Our suite came with a computer, wifi access for our iPhones, a separate shower and bathtub, refrigerator, a sitting area adjacent to the king bedroom, a French balcony with floor to ceiling windows, and a large flat screen television, which has a camera feed that allows one to see the progress of the ship on the river. Our suite was clean, regularly serviced, and well appointed. The executive chef and the seven sous chefs prepared meals using fresh regional foods; the food was plentiful, delicious, and attractively presented. The fact that there was no assigned seating for meals was also a plus; we were able to sit where we pleased and with whom we pleased most of the time. We met some very nice people. The service throughout the cruise was attentive and friendly. The information regularly provided and the daily newsletter outlining times and descriptions of events and activities was a good touch. Musical entertainment in the evenings was also enjoyable. The transportation (coaches) to sites off the river were of high quality and the drivers were very good. The seven local tour guides contracted by AmaWaterways were knowledgeable and were attentive to the needs of the groups while still maintaining control. Too, the idea of dividing passengers, where appropriate, into groups based on their physical ability and agility \u2013 active, regular, and gentle \u2013 certainly met with approval. Based on this initial experience with AmaWaterways, we would be inclined to take another river cruise, perhaps on the Danube."

Extremely romantic and exciting. We took many pictures that are fantastic. We didn't take the dinner cruise .. and don't stress over which cruise you take. There isn't much difference.

A trip aboard a bateaux is a graceful way to see iconic sights near but apart from the streaming hordes of tourists but close enough to glimpse the everyday life of bustling Parisians. The view from the waterfront is steeped in the city's abounding history of palaces, principalities and polite people. Boat ride costs range from a few Euros to more than 100 Euros, so shop carefully. And beware the scamsters who pop up in front of you to \"find\" a ring and attempt to lure you in."

Whatever you do in Paris, the river will be ever present. You stroll on it, cruise on it, commute on it, ride the metro along it's west bank and take pictures of it from ever observation point. At night it is lite and spectacular. My fondest memory was a romantic dinner cruise. No matter how or when or where you see it, it will leave lasting impressions. As it flows past the Eiffel Tower, under the beautiful bridge that connects the Grand and Petit palace to the Invalides, past Musee d'Orsay and the Louvre and on to circle Ile de la Cite and Ile St. Louis and the cathedral Notre Dame, a ride on the Seine captures more sites than any other in Paris. So walk or cruise it or just ride the Batobus that shuttles you from one end to the other. Make a point to do at least one ride at night. It is a whole different world."

The only exception was the stretch where the road drops onto the riverside.The boat trips are inexpensive and gives a different view of the city and taking one in the evening, means you get to see all the significant buildings - and of course the Eiffel - lit up.I'd say definitely spend sometime by the river while you're in Paris and soak up the atmosphere."

Last time we took a Bateau Mouche (riverboat tour) which was really fun. This time we used it as our compass, traversing the Rive Gauche and Rive Droite over the various bridges, including the Pont de l'Archeveche where the hundreds of thousands of 'love locks' are getting so heavy parts of the chain link fence fell into the river! There is very bad pollution in Paris right now, so sometimes standing on the bridge looking torwards the Palais Royale is a little fuzzy, but it doesn't matter. The Seine is the center, the heartbeat of Paris, home to lovers, tourists, sun gods (we saw one very brave soul in his Speedo lying on the concrete), artists and history. It's hard to miss the Seine if you're in Paris, but make sure to spend a few contemplative moments just looking at the water, the Louvre and Hotel des Invalides (I think I've got that right), and remember how many footsteps, proposals, kisses, heartbreaks, brushstrokes, words and life has travelled with the current on the River Seine."

We purchased a Paris Pass and this allowed us discounted admission on several attractions. The Seine River cruise is so marvelous. The departure area for the cruise is very simple to find, at least ours was. I don't know if there are other departure points, but ours way right across from the Eiffel Tower. Boarding the boat was done really quickly and efficiently and the staff was great. The Seine River is great because along its banks are some of the great Paris attractions and monuments like Notre Dame. While cruising and people watching you can see the people put on a kissing show for the cruisers. That was fun. This is a must visit when in Paris!"

One had a child, one was dressed a one of the many runners along the Seine.They come up behind you and pretend they find a ring by your feet, ask if it is yours and then offer it to you. The idea is if you take it they ask for money. The rings look authentic but they are worthless. My advice would be do not even gage in conversation, just ignore and walk on by!But be careful as this is clearly an organised scam and you never know who might be watching."

You can smell of Seine! I almost felt that my Valentines that evening was Seine river, was Eiffel Tower, was Paris!"

This was a definite whirlwind day, with me attempting to maximize the big sites, seeing as it was my only time in Paris thus far.I got off the metro, stepped out, and boom! I was right in front of the Eiffel Tower. How cool! Look, I'm a heavy traveler and while I'm generally sort of meh on big touristy sites. . . c'mon, it's the Eiffel Tower! And it was right there!I walked along the Seine for a while. I'd stop, take in the view, take some photos, then slowly walk on. I eventually crossed the river at Pont d'iena in front of the Eiffel Tower, then walked down the river before eventually wandering down various streets and making my way to the Arc de Triomphe. It really was a lovely way to spend an afternoon and I highly, highly suggest it.Also, I was a single female and felt perfectly safe the entire time. Yes, there are panhandlers and scammers-- just tell them no, ignore them, whatever. Several that came up to me led with, \"Do you speak English?\" to which I said, \"Absolutely not.\" I walked off as they sat bewildered.

The Seine gives you open spaces to see more sights, so each bridge is a fresh viewpoint. And some of the bridges themselves are worthy of seeing. Take a boat ride down the Seine. Each lunch facing the Seine. Walk along the Seine. Really, this is a nice way to spend the day AND get a little exercise. Now...take a boat cruise down the Seine from Paris on one of the river cruise lines. Those boats are long and narrow and hold maybe 140 people BUT the cool thing is that you see the river all the way to Rouen AND make stops at many super little towns along the way. Old towns, old streets, old buildings, old castles. And from Rouen you can take a day-trip to the beaches of Normandy. The Seine is a wonderful river to enjoy."

I almost decided to do a river cruise as an afterthought as it was one of the few \u201cmust-dos\u201d I missed when I first visited Paris in 2008. Although I believe there are numerous companies to choose from I was practical and embarked on a voyage with Les Vedettes du Pont-Neuf, located on the northern edge of Ile de la Cite near, you guessed it, Pont Neuf bridge. The company has a website that you can pre-order tickets on and accepts walk-ins as well. The dock for departure is easily accessible and contains a small shop and bar/eatery that you can hang out at before or after the cruise. Customer service was smooth and efficient during all phases of the experience: ticket purchase, boarding, and exiting. In addition to bilingual dialogue during the cruise they also have a free pamphlet in English that you can use to follow along.I assume the itinerary for most of these experiences is fairly standard. We started with a river view of the Louvre, progressing along the northern shore of the Seine while viewing the Tuileries garden and various bridges. Dialogue was piped in along the way, with a long pause as we neared the Eiffel Tower, everyone took their pictures, and we turned around. The south side of the river was our friend on the way back as we passed the National Assembly, Musee d\u2019Orsay, and Notre Dame cathedral. After rounding the islands we ended up at our starting point sixty minutes later.The cruise was decent enough, but the major problem I had with the experience certainly wasn\u2019t with the company I chose but rather the time of season. If you are ever wondering what turning in to an ice cube feels like then try to stay out on the deck in 30 degree temps while taking pictures of the shore\u2026. And I\u2019m from Minnesota! The wind was a killer here more than anything and really put brakes on what is probably a decent experience at most other times of the year. There are many advantages to visiting Paris in the off-season: less people, less expense, and therefore less hassle among them. Unfortunately, a relaxing cruise on the Seine River is something that is probably best left to the shoulder season or for those early risers in the peak months. Les Vedettes du Pont-Neuf is the company to use if you\u2019re so inclined."

It takes about an hour somebody takes a photo of you or group of you which you can buy at the end. The one thing which was a bit of a disappointment was the commentary. There is a ear phone thing at your seat from which you choose the language you want to hear the commentary, but mine kept on switching to some other language or turning off - i noticed a few other people also said the same. after 10 min i gave up and just admired the view. I am a wheelchair user and had no problem getting on or off BUT alot of problems getting down to ticket office from street level. As i can walk a little i slowly walked down but my husband had to carry the wheelchair down somebody helped him otherwise quiet a few steps down and back up!"

            "review": "Rating a river seems odd, but.... This trip, and the one before it, we really got into watching the Seine. We noticed that other people were doing the same thing. It had been raining, and the Seine was not its usual green color, it was high, choppy and muddy on our first walk, near Quai D'Orsay. Lots of others out walking, many people taking pictures, we admired many kinds of boats.A few days later, on our last day in Paris, we decided to start on the Left Bank, east of Pont Neuf and just walk. Few people were there - there was a place where the Seine was close enough to touch if you were careful, so one of us did that (there's something really fun and mysterious about touching famous bodies of water - people come from all over just to see or touch the Pacific Ocean; we feel that way about the Seine). As we walked, we saw new perspectives on Notre Dame - but particularly on the bridges. The one bridge with the old style mortar made of pebbles was fascinating. Since there were few others there (young kids drinking beer, quite friendly and polite as we passed), we could almost imagine ourselves in another Paris, where boats still tied up to those iron rings and where those old doors opened and boatmen came out...it was quiet and lovely.But seriously, what else could the River Seine receive...except 5 stars? (It's also fun to cruise upon it and all that...when bored in Paris head toward it; when you see a bridge over it, cross it!)"

            "review": "December on the Seine to Normandy Beaches. After previous land tours to German and Austrian Christmas markets (Christkindlmarkt) we decided to see some French Christmas markets and visit the Normandy D-Day landing beaches of June 6, 1944. Had been to the American Cemetery and Memorial at Omaha Beach during a bus tour of French chateau country in 2010 so this time we chose the Canadian Commonwealth Battlefields excursion to Juno Beach offered by Viking River Cruises. Our cruise started at the Paris Quai de Grenelle side of the Seine River within view to the Eiffel Tower. For the Christmas season the Tower sparkled with thousands of pulsing lights on every hour during the evening. Close to our ship dock was a Novotel Hotel where some people had stayed before embarkation. They found it modern, convenient to the Metro and a short walk over to the River Spirit. Also close by is the new (fall 2013) indoor Beaugrenelle shopping mall which includes high-end fashion stores, a Fnac audio-video outlet and even a Marks & Spencer offering British food specialties. Prior to leaving Paris, cruise passengers had a city tour by bus and an excursion thru the Metro to the Christmas Village (Village de Noel) of small white outdoor \u2018cabins\u2019 along both sides of the Champs Elysees. Nowhere near the quality of German Christmas Markets but the lights at night were wonderful. We were in Cabin 321 on the River Spirit and cruised to Conflans, Vernon, the white cliffs of Les Andelys then Rouen (historic Joan of Arc sites and a small Christmas market) stopping along the way west to dock overnight and take included walking tours. Mornings were misty but the sun arrived for the afternoons. Instead of standing up on deck to see the lock passages, the in-cabin TV had a channel with live cam transmission of the process as well as each site where we docked. The cabin was small but functional with a sliding outside \u2018picture\u2019 window (not the balconies of larger river cruise ships) and a bathroom with shower stall and curtain (again, not the glass enclosure of larger ships). At Conflans we boarded buses to Auvers-sur-Oise for an included excursion to artist Vincent van Gogh\u2019s 1890 room and landscape inspirations. Unfortunately the bus for Group 2C had been left outside overnight and the windows on the left side were covered with opaque white frost. As we were being driven, our local guide Anne-Claire kept pointing out what we could see to our left only to be told time and again that nobody could see out of those windows. When we arrived at our destination she claimed it was impossible for our driver, Patrick, to clear the windows because he could not reach that high! Viking\u2019s Program Director Annika was able to enlighten Anne-Claire and Patrick about the use of long-handle window cleaning equipment because when we returned to the bus the windows had been scraped clear of frost and polished.Food on board the River Spirit was excellent with a buffet breakfast that included North American staples \u2013 cereals, eggs, bacon, sausage, toast, plus fresh croissants, smoked salmon, soft Normandy cheeses, yogurt and fruit. Lunch on board was served either in the dining room or, a lighter version, in the forward lounge. Dinner was served at 7:00 PM and included a choice of appetizers, main courses and desserts plus the option of selecting from a list of \u201cAmerican Favorites\u201d. Wines and beers were available along with non-alcoholic beverages. We enjoyed the optional oysters and champagne tasting (39 Euro each) although the Champagne Cartier Brut was not that dry and did not retain its bubbles in the glass. Oysters are a French holiday favorite and the how-to-open-oysters demonstration by ship culinary staff was both informative and humorous. A good time was had by all (except the oysters).Before dinner was the Cocktail Hour then the daily Port Talk about the next day\u2019s itinerary and, after dinner, entertainment back in the Lounge with music by \u2018Blondie\u2019 at the piano and presentations on topics such as Painters and the Seine, French Lessons, French Cheeses and, Christmas Carols. On December 12th three buses took passengers from Rouen on a day trip to the American or Canadian WWII beaches. Since we had already been to Omaha Beach on a previous tour, we opted for the Juno Beach tour with only 23 people. It included a stop in Bayeux with its cathedral and museum to see the 11th century tapestry, actually embroidered linen 230-feet/7- meters long depicting the Norman conquest of England. We passed the British War Cemetery outside Bayeux then joined the two Omaha groups for lunch at the 6 juin Restaurant at Les Arromanches harbour on the Normandy coast. Next we went to Juno Beach Information Centre (be sure to make time to walk down to the actual beach), the Pegasus Bridge and Museum at Ranville (check out the movie The Longest Day), the isolated Canadian War Cemetery in the middle of farm fields at B\u00e9ny-sur-Mer then Australian/New Zealand military graves nestled near a country church at Saint-D\u00e9sir. A full day and we got back to the River Spirit docked at Rouen well after dark but in time for dinner.On our return to Paris some passengers took optional excursions to Versailles or the Louvre but, having visited them many times before, we stayed on board and stood on the top deck of the ship as it cruised under Seine bridges and along suburbs and industrial yards. Eventually we had to go below as the older bridges were very low but, in the evening as we approached the Pont de Grenelle and our dock again, the captain stopped in front of the lighted 37-foot/11- meter replica of the Statue of Liberty on the manmade \u00cele aux Cygnes (Swans Island) so passengers could take photos of Lady Liberty. Overall, a great cruise. One of the best we have taken. Highly recommended."

            "review": "Seine River - What would Paris be without it?. The Seine River cuts through the middle of Paris, separating the Left Bank to the South and the Right Bank to the North. On both sides of the river you can visit important and interesting districts and neighbourhoods, with many world class attractions, museums, churches, gardens and parks. A very good dining and shopping environment can be found on both sides of the river as well. Important islands can also be found in the middle of the Seine, mainly the famous Ile de la Cite, where Notre Dame Cathedral is found. The Seine is crossed by many bridges, several that make interesting stops to make for tourists. Our three favourite are Pont Alexandre III, Pont des Arts and Pont Neuf. In addition to visiting the bridges, it is very much worth walking along the river bank to enjoy the river, city views and the interesting stalls selling souvenirs, books and trinkets to help you remember your time in Paris. You can also take a river cruise or dinner cruise along the Seine if interested in spending time directly on the water. Overall, while not a major attraction of the city, the Seine River is an important part of Paris and it greatly contributes to the make up of this wonderful and beautiful city. Paris wouldn't be the same without the Seine."

If you are new to Paris and this is your first visit, the boat tours along the Seine will introduce you to many of the attractions so that you ca decide what you want to see and do, in the event that you have arrived in Paris with no plan and did not do your homework before arriving. The tours are more spectacular at night, when the monuments are illuminated (assuming that the weather is good). There will be many photo opportunities but don't expect to learn a lot of details about the individual monuments and buildings, and depending on the day and season, the tour(s) can become a little like a cattle car. If you have the time, walking (or biking) along the Seine is likely to be more rewarding and you will see a lot more details. There are lots of bridges that cross the river, so that you can weave back and forth and repeatedly cross the river for a different perspective. For example, take the Metro to Alma Marceau, cross the Pont d' Alma, come back and reward yourself by sitting down, outside at one of the restaurants there (Chez Francis is good, there are other options), and watch the people and traffic flow by. The Pont des Invalides, Pont Alexander III, Pont de la Concorde, Pont Solferino, Pont Royal, Pont du Carousel, Pont des Arts, Pont Neuf, Pont au Change, Pont d'Arcole, Pont de Tournelle, Pont de Sully, etc....all will service your purposes admirably by giving you a great view of the river and the boat traffic. Don't be in a hurry, this is Paris. The people watching people opportunities are fantastic. So are the photo opportunities (even in bad weather)."

We were able to view a number of very well-known attractions and landmarks both on the left and right banks, from a unique viewpoint on the river.The Eiffel Tower was unlit as we departed but was brilliantly illuminated in a multitude of colours as we returned at the end of the cruise. Amongst the other places of interest that we were able to view during the cruise were the Musee de Louvre, the Musee d' Orsay, the National Assembly building, Hotel d'Invalides, Pont Neuf, Pont Alenadre III, the Grand Palais, Ile de la Citie and the Notre Dame.One of the fascinating aspects of the cruise was the fact that in the vicinity of Notre Dame cathedral and Ile de la Citie the areas were crowded with Parisiennes sitting on the edge of the river banks, enjoying the warm evening and watching the river traffic go by.We throughly enjoyed our cruise on the Seine and wished that it had been of a longer duration. Highly recommended!During other days during our Paris stay we walked along both banks of the river and across several of the pedestrian bridges across the river. These experiences gave us the opportunity to take in and experience other aspects of the river and it's surrounds which were not obvious from onboard the cruise boat.When you visit Paris, you must experience the River Seine in one form or another, whether via a cruise or by walking, to truly experience the essence of this fabulous city."

It is a river you simply cannot miss while in Paris, and would end up, crossing it, one way or another. My family and I had the opportunity of taking a stroll along its bank one late afternoon after crossing Pont Du Carrousel (bridge) and walking down a flight of steps, before walking the entire length to Pont De Concorde (bridge) on our way to Champs Elysees. In between, we stopped to sit on one of the concrete benches to admire the river, its surrounding, the buildings and indulge in the french pastries we'd bought, very happy to simply enjoy the moment. It was incredible how peaceful the bank was given the fact that traffic above was near chaos! On another occasion, we took a night cruise (Bateaux-Mouches) along this river. Exactly at 9pm, before the cruise set off, we saw Eiffel Tower fully illuminated, blinking blinking, like hundreds of stars lighting up the night sky. It was quite magical, especially with the light drizzle. It was whilst absorbing all the sights of the lit buildings like Notre Dame, Lourve, Musee d'Orsay that it dawned on me just how easy it is to... not only fall in love in Paris, but also to fall in love with Paris!"

The views from the river give some great angles for photos so being out on deck is a must for photographers. The commentary is interesting and in English as well as French. I'd say this is a good start to a visit of Paris because you get a potted history and views of some sites all in a short space of time - then you can go and explore for yourself in more detail.

There was no fuss as the ticket operators were very friendly and were able to fit us on a cruise later that evening which cost 10 euros. Whilst on the cruise you could listen to the guide telling you about the history of Paris and the river aswell as pointing out the landmarks you were passing or you can walk about the boat taking photos of the city.

This was a great experience and I learned a lot! There is really nothing that I didn't like. The food is fantastic and the staff is very attentive to your needs. We traveled with the whole family and my wife and I were probably the youngest people in the ship. This is not like your regular \"party animal\" cruise ships such as Carnival etc... this is a very classy educational cruise. At every port, there's different tour options and its all inclusive. I suggest to do the bike tour and sign up asap due to the limited bikes that they have on board. Most of the guests were actually middle aged folks (i am being politically correct, but that means old folks) but that actually made it fun to hang out with them due to their outlook in life. If you like a laid back cruise, good food and wine, historical and educational tours, this is definitely for you."

But come sunset on a partly cloudy day, as you stand on the Northeast corner of the Pont Neuf, the clouds turn shades of yellows, then oranges, then reds and the Eiffel Tower stands in the distance. And, all of those colors are reflected in the river. Then you are in romantic Paris. You want to stand there and capture the moment forever. But slowly it continues to change and the colors deepen."

The commentary was clear (and included in the price) though the phones not very clean - mine smelt of garlic and curry !! The guide gave instructions in three languages and very well too. The commentary seemed to start with each bridge so this was the time to put the device to one's ear.

You may wonder why street vendors along the Seine are selling padlocks with three keys. LOCKS OF LOVE. Yes, it's touristy, but do it. Buy a lock, write your message of love on the lock (with a supplied Sharpie) and, with the one you love, find a place to lock it on tone of the bridges. Each person keeps a key, and you both toss the third key in the Seine. Very romantic. Really, it is very romantic and emotional, especially when you both return and find your lock. Very romantic."

Because the paths are flat and it's easy walking - it's not a hard walk. The river is alive - many, many tourist boats, we even witnessed some sort of celebration/dedication (maybe ashes had been scattered into the river) where a group of young people were gathered with a picnic - and were individually dropping roses into the river. Late am and afternoon there are lots of cute and quaint little stalls that open up - selling the usual touristy stuff, some have old books and wares - and they are not 'in your face' pushing for sales as in Asian countries. A nice way to view Paris from either side."

The last time was 2011 on the Rhine and both were with Viking River Cruise lines in Oct. What to say about this particular trip on the Pride: From where it docks it is a 40 minute walk to the Eiffel Tower. Our trip did not include any pre or post trip extensions so it was fortuitous that I booked the Eiffel on my own online prior to the trip for the evening of our arrival (10 pm worked out great for after dinner walk at 9 pm). Had I not done this, we would not have been able to go up the tower as no time was alotted but for viewing from a distance on the standard tour. Also, nighttime is THE time to go if you only get one time to visit as you get to see the tower sparkle on the hour and the view of Paris from above at night is breathtaking.High points of this particular cruise: Normandy beaches- very moving and informative. If you are non US citizen they have alternate cemetary/beach visit for foreign soldiers. Speaking to those guests said equally moving as well.Low point(s):If you take away the Arc du Triomphe, the wonderful Museums and of course the Seine with the beautiful Alexander and unique Locks bridge, you have to wonder what the heck is with the NY/SF style shopping, McDonalds, Starbucks, Banana Republic etc? Nothing here you can't get at home except for the tag that says France. That definitely took away from the 'romantic' feel/beauty of France on the Champs D'Elysees.Another Low point:Foodborne illness on the ship possibly from ordering a turkey sandwich at lunch (had steak Charlemagne the night before- served very rare as is customary). Who orders a turkey sandwich in France? Lost a day and a half of touring sick. Live and learn. Mustn't eat with impunity.Other excursions included- Paris bus/walking tour (viewing things from afar or simply while riding the bus), Claude Monet's house, and the towns of Les Andelys, Conflans, Rouen.Purchased the optional Louvre and Versailles tours. They were nice.Made some great acquaintances on the trip, Didn't need our outlet converter as there was one 110 in the cabin.If you've never been the Paris/France before, this is a low stress way to do it as far as having things planned for you, But once you have done it, you will probably come away with enough info/knowledge to make/plan the trip on your own at your own pace and leisure. I found the French to be very courteous and helpful etc. (preconceived stereotypes notwithstanding) and yes I found their English invariably better than my French."

Anyways, we did one right at dusk, and another when it was fully dark. I'd recommend doing 2 as well since the price isn't bad, compared to some of the other companies. It's such a different sight to see from the River during the day versus at night. Also, if you're going to take the 8 pm cruise, which is on the 2 story boat, get there early, to ensure that you get seats up top. Anyways, the River itself goes all throughout Paris and really is something. Gives you a different perspective to the Ctiy."

We had a good commentary on the historic sites along the river, heard about the 39 bridges that traverse the river and motored along the river around Ile de cite and Ile St. Louis and around the islands back to the tower. It is a great trip night with the lights of the city or on a clear day. Your perspective changes of the sites and you are out of the hustle and bustle of the buses, cars and tour groups wandering the sites above. There are lots of good photo opportunities while you chill out and learn something new about the city of lights."

The Oldest bridge is the Pont Neuf. If you are the kind of person who likes watching boats this is a great spot.There are floating restaurants, discos, cafes and free benches for all those who are just as happy to enjoy the same view with their own wine, bread and cheese from a local grocer. confused about the terms right bank and left bank? The system is very simple and was devised because the river's curvy nature often does make orientation difficult. The trick is to remember when you face downriver the left bank is on your left and the right bank is on your right. If you can't figure out which way the water is flowing (don't look at the boats, they go upstream too) drop a leave or look for some debris and see which way it's floating."

The Good: The sights, seeing the city unobstructed from the river and all the historic buildings that make up ParisThe Bad: some of the bridges can be very crowded with people, bicycle and motor vehicle traffic so be watchful and careful.The Ugly: There are Gypsies that will try and swindle you (they will amazingly pick up a \"gold\" ring right in front of you LOL we had 2 right in a row do the same trick) or keep you distracted to pick your pockets and lots of beggars.On the scuba bubble scale I give this river 7 out of 10 bubbles."

You have a choice of several entrees along with an appetizer and dessert. Also, red or white wine is served based on your selection of entree. A singer walks around the boat and sings songs in French. One of the highlights is at the end when the boat approaches the Statue of liberty .

Our tour had French/English commentary on the way to the Eiffel Tower, then no commentary at all coming back. The highlight was my first close-up view of the Eiffel Tower. That was impressive. Otherwise you can get a much better experience just walking the same area that the boat covers, plus you will get to see a lot more as the river has concreted banks and walls along the entire length of the tour and you really can't see any significant distance back from the river due to the high banks."

Taking the River Cruise was timed so we got to see the great sights of the museums and Notre Dame during daylight, and at sunset as we were turning around to dock, we say the Eiffel Tower, that is just steps away from the cruises light up. We had the bonus of having tickets for the tower, and then a narrated bus ride around the other city attractions at night. FABULOUS beginning of our 4 days!"

This is a Seine Bateaux that only runs during the day and stops at eight docking stations on either side of the river. Examples are Gare Dorsay Museun, Notre Dame, Eiffel Tower, some misc gardens and the zoo, Louvre Museum, etc. fare is 15 euro, stops are spaced about 15 to 20 minutes between stops. The big advantage of course is that the boat is not in the Paris traffic and not an underground Metro trip where the sights are rather minimal. The boats are clean, all clean glass for total viewing, and comfortable seating. Our first experience, but a very positive one. I think there are Paresians that use it as a commuter vessel."

It is fair to say that when you take one of the many boat tours on the river, you will get a summary history of the city. We love to take a boat both during the daytime and the evening when the twinkling lights of Paris seduce you.Even if you just sit in a cafe at river level which you can do in a number of places( beneath the Alexander Trois bridge on the left bank and also down near Notre Dame also on e left bank) you can become mezmerized by the boat traffic. It is not as dramatic as the port of Hong Kong but still fascinating. When we take a boat, we prefer the Vedettes de Paris, which one can get at the foot of the Eiffel Tower or near the Pont Neuf end of Ile de la Cite. This company is smaller than the Bateaux Mouches and the chairs seem more comfortable. Either comapny will offera very reasonably priced and interesting tour. There is another company that runs the Bat-o-bus, which is like a water taxi. You can get on and off at one of many famous tourist sites along the Seine. One place you can pick it up is at the foot of the Eiffel Tower but check their website for other locations. it is more expensive but offers a speedy way to get from one site to another.You can walk along the Seine at river level, in many parts of Paris, and this can be fun. In the summer, there is a beach and palm trees, and tropical drinks. On Sundays, you can also bike along the Seine in several places.It offers something for everyone, including runners who want to get away from the traffic and be inspired by the river.Outside of Paris, the Seine meanders through bucolic countryside and can be fun either for a short trip or an extended visit of the countryside."

We started to take the cruise 1 hour before sunset. On the way back to the port near Eiffel Tower, we had great time to enjoy sunset from the deck.

Like every other part of our visit it was all a bit hectic. There must have been about 6 groups of school children, led by teachers who to my disappointment were ignorant enough to hold their arms out in front of our group in order to stop us getting on before them. Once we sat down the views were beautiful. Being able to see so much of the city whilst travelling along the river is a great experience but the huge downside was that every 2-3 minutes we passed under a bridge at which point every one of the hundreds of kids screamed and shouted. I know kids are kids but after the fifth or sixth time it got pretty annoying and the teachers showed no sign of caring. However, we still enjoyed the cruise and the river itself hosts some impressive scenery."

The kids loved being on the boat and they take your picture before you board so was really nice to get that picture at the end which costs 10e. One of the bridges is full of padlocks where couples seal their love and throw the key into the Seine. Lovely to see the different bridges of Paris too. I think if we were to do it again we would go at night-time to see the lights. We went in the day-time cos of the young kids. It was nice to get a different angle of view of the attractions. You can also go out on the deck if you don't want to stay indoors or sit on top of the boat. I also suggest you pre-order this trip online before you go on it to skip the v long queues."

It's the perfect way to orient to the city, you'll cover all the major monuments in 90 minutes and you'll learn some interesting details. I've joined friends visiting no fewer than 10 times over the last several years and I never tire of the ride. I highly recommend (can't stress this enough) taking the Bateaux-Mouche located on the Pont Neuf bridge called Bateaux Vedettes du Pont Neuf. Having sampled the various tours offered, if you speak English or French this is the tour for you. There might be spanish too, can't recall. If you take the \"original tour\" located at Pont Alma, you'll hear in EIGHT different languages, that's the Louvre, but you won't hear any additional details. For what it offers in multi-cultural capacity, it lacks in content.Our friends at Bateaux Vedettes du Pont Neuf offer a great tour for 8 or 9\u20ac depending on the time of the day, and buying your tickets online is less expensive than walking up and paying 13\u20ac at the time of arrival. They offer wine and beverages before departure and some you can take along for the ride. The boats are clean and safe and their staff is pleasant.Daytime in the sun is great, but seeing the city at night also has it's merit. No matter what time of day you pick, this should be on your TOP 5 things to do in Paris list!!!"

From the river you can see the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre and Notre Dame. You will wonder why the side railings on the bridges are different colors and what makes that so. People hook locks in the chains. The purpose of putting locks on the bridge railings is unknown to us. But there was a guy selling locks. For what we wondered.You might catch a view of two lovers kissing on the bridge or sitting on a bench on the side of the river. You might even catch a view of people walking their dogs. And depending on the time of day, you might even catch a beautiful sunset.Do this even if just to be able to say you did."

With some exceptions, most of the big business commerce is conducted on the Right Bank which boasts some great sites as well, including the Louvre, the Tuilleries, l'Opera, Madelene, Place du Vosages, Place Concorde and many fine restaurants and shopping opportunities. It has a more urban feel than the Left Bank which, in my opinion, is more picturesque. The Left Bank is justifiably renowned for its many beautiful sites (the Eifel Tower, Musee d'Orsay, the Sorbonne, St. Germain des Pres, and lots of fine boutique shopping and restaurants. The Seine itself is a major attraction. Both during the day and at night, many people stroll along its banks or perch on its ponts to watch the views. There is an isle in the middle called the Ile de la Cite on which the Notre Dame Cathedral and St. Chappelle sit. But the river is not just a site for tourists to visit, it functions as it has for centuries as a major route of commerce."

My family and I recently came back from our 21 Day Romantic Seine & Rhone Paris to Barcelona APT tour in June 2013 on board AmaLegro and AmaDagio. We all had a wonderful time there and I would like to use this opportunity to share my experiences and thoughts with everyone. Hopefully, people would find my article useful in their decision making and preparation for their trips with APT and/or AmaWaterways.There are 2 parts of my review: part 1 covers 3 days in Paris and 7 day on board AmaLegro, and part 2 covers 7 day on board AmaDagio and 3 days in Barcelona. This is part 1 of my review.Our trip started with 3 days in Paris where APT organised a city tour visiting the second level of the Eiffel Tower on Day 2 morning and a welcome dinner cruise along the Seine River, followed by a Paris Illuminations Tour on Day 2 evening. There were 3 \u201cFreedom of Choice\u201d tours offered on Day 3 morning. All of the tours organised by APT were quite good, but the quality of food and services from the welcome dinner cruise along the Seine River was below average compared to the food and services offered on board AmaLegro and AmaDaigo.We stayed in Hotel du Collectionneur Arc de Triomphe for 3 nights. The hotel rooms are spacious and well equipped. I enjoyed their breakfast buffet very much as there was wide range of delicious hot and cold food available. Services from this hotel were wonderful and it is within walking distance to Avenue des Champs Elysees and Arc de Triomphe.There was a problem with our Paris trip due to the last minute change in itinerary by APT. When we first booked our trip in October 2012, APT brochure indicated that Paris itinerary only has freedom of choice tours available on Day 2 morning and we would have Day 3 completely free. So our family had planned to take Versailles excursion with APT, and organised our own tours via Internet for Day 3. But by the time we received our confirmed tour itinerary which was just 3 weeks before departure, we found out that Paris itinerary has changed significantly. This was a shock to us and completely threw our initial planning into chaos. First, we were not happy to receive the confirmed itinerary late, e.g. 3 weeks before departure, instead of 4-6 weeks before departure as it stated in official APT documentation. Second, I was not able to get any clear and consistent answers from either travel agent or APT call center staff about the finished time of the morning tours in Day 2 and 3. Everyone was telling me different answers which made it impossible for me to make any arrangement for the afternoon tours. When I discussed this timing problem and sudden cancellation of Versailles tour with both travel agent and APT call center staff, the answers I got were along the lines of \u201cplease talk to your tour director once you arrived in Paris\u201d. I did not feel comfortable with APT\u2019s approach of leaving everything to the last minute. Based on my previous experiences travelling with APT, I did not believe it was feasible for 1 tour director to address 100 people\u2019s enquiries completely and successfully on Day 1. We only had 3 days in Paris and there were so many things we wanted to do and places we wanted to visit. In the end, we forfeited the \u201cFreedom of Choice\u201d tour on Day 3 and arranged our own tours to go to Versailles in the morning and Louvre in the afternoon. I filed a formal complaint to APT after the tour and I was able to resolve this issue successfully with APT.After 3 days in Paris, we were transferred to Seine River on Day 4 late afternoon where our luxury river ship, AmaLegro, awaited.Compared to our previous experiences with AmaBella and AmaVerde travelled from Amsterdam to Budapest in 2011, AmaLegro is very similar to those 2 ships but a few years older, e.g. all of the facilities and set up are similar. There are public lounges in the front and back of the ship, free internet and Wi-Fi access, and gym. The cabins are well equipped and reasonably spacious. The food and shore excursions were certainly the highlights of my cruises. The quality of the food (3 meals, morning tea, and afternoon tea) was excellent and services from the restaurant and bar staff were very attentive and always do their best to anticipate customers\u2019 needs. For example, unlike AmaBella and AmaVerde where I always had to ask (or should I use the word \u201cbeg\u201d) to have my water and non-alcoholic drink refilled during my meals, AmaLegro is the only the ship where my drink always being refilled before it ran out, I never had to ask. However, if you only drink alcohol, then there won\u2019t be any problem because the wait / bar staff constantly walking around with red & white wine to refill everyone\u2019s glass. Also, there was no limit on the drink (included in the fee already), so I have seen some people started drinking from the afternoon all the way till late at night. For people don\u2019t drink much alcohol, you do feel like you are substituting other people\u2019s drink.My favourite shore excursions along Seine River were (1) Giverny where we visited the home of Claude Monet and its famous gardens; (2) Rouen, heart of Normandy region; (3) picturesque Honfleur; (4) beautiful Les Andelys and Chateau Gaillard built by Richard the Lionheart; (5) Chateau de Malmaison, home of General Napoleon and Josephine. All passengers on walking tours were accompanied by Quietvox and people could join different groups to suit their fitness level. There was daily information session every afternoon by the tour director informing everyone the details of shore excursions for the next day. Our tour director, Mr Peter Whitehead, is an Australian who always gave animated information sessions filled with lots of humour.If you are planning to participate in Rouen cathedral light show at 11pm, then please make sure that you take a torch with you from the ship reception before you leave. And always ask your tour director where to meet once the light show finished. There was a problem at the night walk to the Rouen cathedral during my trip, e.g. on the way walking from the ship to cathedral with our tour director, Mr Whitehead, there was no information from him about where to meet after the light show and he didn\u2019t organise any torch for us. So after the light show, all of us were very confused with what to do next, and it took us a while to find Peter W because there were many people and not much light in the square, then we have to walk back to the ship in the dark by ourselves.Despite the excellent food and outstanding services provided by the ship crew, and mostly well-coordinated shore excursions, there is a critical safety concern associate with the design of the spiral staircases to level 1 cabins. Compare to all other stairs in the ship, the tight construction of these stairs with narrow staircase width, steep gradient, and handrail on only one side, they are not easy for the elderly passengers to use. With majority of the passengers on board over the age 50, every day I saw elderly passengers struggling with these stairs. I am a much younger person and even I found the stairs gradient very challenging. I always had to slow down and hold on to the handrail tightly when walking up and down the stairs. I felt climbing up these stairs was like a rock climbing exercise because these stairs are just too steep. When my family and I raise our concern about the unsafe design of stairs to level 1 cabins, and asked if we could have an upgrade to upper level cabins e.g. either we paid extra or for free, given the ship was not at its full capacity. Peter W said that he would investigate but he didn\u2019t think upgrade would be possible. He never got back to us. During the same conversation, Mr Whitehead also indicated that \u201cwe got what we paid for\u201d and we should already know there are stairs to level 1 when we booked our trip. I found Mr Whitehead\u2019s comments rude, unfair, and I felt his tone was quite condescending. Later, I found out tour director\u2019s room is on level 2, so he might not aware of how difficult these stairs are to elderly passengers, thus, dismissed our concern as just some silly nonsenses.We were aware of the existences of the stairs at the time of booking, but we didn\u2019t know the design and shape of the stairs to level 1 is so \u201celderly user unfriendly\u201d. There was neither information nor photos on APT brochure providing any indication on the shape and design of the spiral staircases to level 1 cabins. When we were on-board AmaBella and AmaVerde last time, we stayed on level 3 and the stairs were easy. If we were given clear information (e.g. photos) about the design and shape of the level 1 stairs at the time of booking, then we would be able to assess the situation accurately and make an informed decision, e.g. we would not have chosen level 1 cabins. All other stairs in the ship are quite easy to use.I filed a formal complaint to APT after the tour to raise my concerns on the (1) stairs safety, and (2) unsafe and poorly coordinated nigh tour at Rouen. APT addressed my concern about the night tour swiftly by immediately issuing a memo to all tour directors and ships that they must provide torch to passengers for all night tours. APT told me that because the night tour to Rouen cathedral was an informal tour, therefore our tour director, Mr Whitehead, thought there was no need to do any coordination. APT was initially sceptical to my concern about the level 1 stairs and told me that these staircases comply with European safety standards, and since nobody ever complaint about the stairs and have been no accidents recorded, then it must be an isolated problem. Our tour director, Mr Whitehead, declined any wrong doing in telling us \u201cyou got what you paid for\u201d. So I had no choice but to liaise with other level 1 passengers and encourage them to contact APT and tell APT what they thought about level 1 stairs. In the end, APT agreed to pass on my suggestions regarding a second handrail to AmaWaterways for future consideration, and APT would encourage anyone who has disclosed their mobility concerns to book cabins on level 2 or 3 in the future. APT refused to refund us the portion of gratuities that would go to tour director, Mr Whitehead, because that was already included in the overall fee. I was very disappointed with their decision because I thought gratuities were supposed to use to encourage good performance, not insulting customer.Overall, my family and I had a lovely time in Paris and on board AmaLegro. It could have been perfect holiday for us if it wasn\u2019t the dangerous stairs and humiliating experiences with the tour director, Mr Whitehead. We do not hold any grudge or vendetta against APT or AmaWaterways, but we want to share our experiences with people who are considering taking the European river cruise with APT / AmaWaterways, so people would be much better prepared than us. Personally, I am disappointed with APT / AmaWaterways for not accepting my suggestions of proactively showing photos of spiral staircases to level 1 cabins to customers who are considering booking level 1 cabins as that would help customers to do an accurate risk assessment and make an informed decision. I wonder if such conduct would be counted as \u201cmisleading or deceptive conduct\u201d under \u201cAustralian Consumer Law\u201d because the law requires a business to tell a customer all relevant details about a product or service, e.g. a complete story. A business is legally required to ensure that the overall impression conveyed is complete and accurate taking into account all illustrations."

Even if you see just the segment at the heart of the city, it is enough to fire up your imagination and make you think a hundred places you want to go next. Going at night is much better than by day and a summer one for sure. All the main buildings are illuminated and you'll get a chance to see also the vibrating life on the banks of the Seine: dance festivals, lovers walking hand in hand, jazz jam sessions, people just enjoying the stars. A good memory maker for sure."

Must find yourself a spot on the deck to enjoy the sun and the wind if not too cold. The only minor thing I found is that, there should be a special spot even on the open deck for smokers so the nonsmokers would not have to keep avoiding their smoke. And they way it will be save for children to enjoy their cruises as well, away from smokers. That day when I was in the cruise, there are some school teachers bringing todlers for an excursion trip, and I saw the teacher busy hauling the children away from smokers."

The river ship was comfortable, intimate, and offered wonderful French food.

When my wife, two daughters, and I went up the Eiffel Tower, we saw how beautiful the river is and see how important the river is to Paris. We eventually took a boat ride up the river from the Musee D'orsay and enjoyed it, but we had just as much fun walking along the river and watching the boat traffic go up and down the main artery of Paris. The bridges are all fascinating and my daughters particular liked the bridge with all of the locks. If we ever go back to Paris, I plan to spend time just sitting and watching the river again."

There is so much to see that you cant see everything on one short trip. the rest of the sightseeing was enjoyable but sore on the feet !"

This was a terrific tour although because the heavy rain that Europe had last winter made it a little difficult to get to all places that we paid for. But it was a once in a life time experience for us and we thoroughly enjoyed every minute. There were so many bridges we went under and a couple that we got out and walked over which was just as good. This tour is an absolute must and the best part is that you can hop on and hop off. Stay and look around at any things you want to see or just get on and get to the next thing. I loved our time on the Seine and am so happy that I got this experience."

Do it early in your stay then choose from the fifty or so attractions you pass as to which ones you want to spend more time at.Some trips offer dinner.

Most places in Paris charge a person to use the toilet. This is one thing if you aren't making a purchase there, but I really feel that when you are spending money on their attraction, they could at least let you use a toilet. It was .50 euro to use a filthy, tiny bathroom with 2 men standing outside handing you a Kleenex because there are no paper towels. We were a little disgusted with that after paying for the boat ride. However, the Seine itself was a nice historic ride."

They make a loop and stop at all the top attractions: Eiffel Tower, Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay, Saint-Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s, Notre Dame, Jardin de Plantes, Hotel DeVille, the Louvre, and Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es and back again to the Eiffel Tower. See Paris from a whole different perspective from the water. Also, Paris at night is spectacular. You will know why they call it The City of Light.A word of warning however, I don't recommend the Batobus as an alternative method of transport. I had the idea that I could float along, see some sights, and get to the other end of the city efficiently. This is slooooooow transport, so don't try multi-tasking like I did. If you need to get across town quickly, take Metro. If you are in no particular hurry, the Batobus is a nice option. The entire round trip takes about 90 minutes.P.S. there are vending machines onboard"

The trip by canal is THE way to see Paris from a different angle, the mixture of water, trees, nature and then - Paris comes into view! The mixture of old and new architecture is second to none and a great experience. The French canals have lots of facilities for gas, electricity and water and in a lot of 'Port de Plaisance' (which are places to moor your boat), there are usually shops within an easy reach. We were able to eventually moor our boat in Paris Arsenal Marina for a cost of 28 Euros a night which might seem a bit pricey but where else could you get a place in the middle of Paris for that amount of money? This price will alter with the length of your boat, ours is 38 foot long. Also, they have all facilities such as washing machines, showers, electricity, water and free wifi. I appreciate that not everyone is going to be able to do this but if you can, I strongly recommend it. An alternative to see Paris from the water would be to take one of the river cruises which are very popular but I am not sure of the cost of these. There are a number of companies doing the same thing and I am pretty certain that the prices will be within a euro of each other. The boats do move very quickly but cover a good deal of the Seine (some even come into the marina!) which saves the old shoe leather and poorly feet! Additionally, along the Seine, you can rent sun beds, umbrellas etc to relax on the man made beaches which are very clean and well maintained. You can't go in the water obviously but there are 'mist showers' where you can walk through to cool off. There are toilets (clean) and first aid response on the shore and on the water too. All in all, it is a fabulous holiday spot with something for everyone. Is it pricey? Not as bad as you think it would be. There are lots of little restaurants who do toasted sandwiches, salads etc and they are probably on a par with the UK. Beer is expensive at around 8 euros a pint but wine is cheaper!"

You miss out on being able to stop and enjoy the view, shops, the artists selling amazing posters, art and other interesting things and little cafes along the way. You can walk down right on the river or along the streets above. Visit a supermarket and buy some bread and cheese and sit down on the rivers edge and enjoy the feel of Paris. This is much cheaper than the overpriced restaurants in the tourist areas. The bridges are also worth looking at as they contain a lot of history.

Time youself to include queue time so you can get on the boat around the time the light are being turned on. Some piers have vending machines that sell tickets that can save you half an hour to queue for tickets. Many operators are on the Seine doing identical thing. So decide where you want to get on (may it be near a subway station, or a landmark you want to visit) and go."

For 15 euros per person you can ride the Batobus all day, and hop off and on as many times as you like. For 18 euros per person, you can buy a two day pass, which is what we did. The Batobus makes eight stops. Our fabulous hotel was in between The Hotel Deville stop and the Notre Dame stop. Batobus runs from 10 am until 9:30 pm. Other stops along the river include Champs Elysses, The Louvre, The Eiffel tower, Musee D'Orsay, Saint Germaine, and Jardins de Plantes. Batobus offers spectacular panoramic views and convenience. All along River Seine are cafes, the beaches, houseboats and the most amazing architecture one could imagine. The river is beautiful day and night and has a life all it's own. Approaching I'lse de Cite and I'lse Saint Louis by boat creates quite a spectacular visual. If you've never seen Paris from the River Seine your missing Paris."

My French host bought day-tickets for a Batobus boat trip that performed a fixed circuit passing by many famous museums, churches, bridges and monuments. I believe the cost was 15 Euros a ticket, which is not cheap. Anyway, it was a beautiful sunny day and a very pleasant way to see so many sights. The boat travels down one side of the river and returns on the other side. Although the temperature was 31C, a pleasant breeze from the clean, green-coloured river kept us cool. You are allowed to leave the boat at any of 8 locations, returning to board a subsequent boat (they arrive every 20 minutes). We did this once at the Notre Dame stop. Commentary is provided in four languages and you are given a leaflet that shows the route to be followed and all the possible points when you can leave the boat. It was a very enjoyable ride, although I think it would be much less good on a cloudy or raining day. During August there are many such boats on the river, all of which are almost full of passengers. It seems that you can always find a seat, though."

We (2 adults and 4 children) had to walk from the Pont Alma to the Musee d'Orsay so we decided to go via a riverside stroll along the Seine(I want to say the Left Bank).

It was entertaining for the kids to jump onto the various playground sets, etc. so we didn't hear too much complaining about the distance we walked which was nice. I wouldn't necessarily make it a point to come to spend an afternoon or anything but it is nice for a break from the hustle and bustle of museums and other busy attractions."

The guide informed us of all the sights we were seeing along with a little history of each thing. The views of the people all over the banks, the Notre Dame cathedral, the artificial beach they truck in, and of course the Eiffel Tower twinkling at night made it an amazing tour. There were storm clouds rolling in and a nice breeze to cut the heat in July, but it didn't rain on us. Someone threw an egg from a bridge that hit the deck. The next day in line at the catacombs I mentioned it to a family in line and they laughed, stating that they were on the same cruise and it had hit right by their legs. It did not detract from the tour and was a fluke. I'd take the tour again. I wish hey went down past the Eiffel to SW the Statue of Liberty there on the river."

Quite a few big cities have rivers flowing through them and by nature the earliest settlements are around the banks, but the Seine may probably be one of the best rivers flowing through a city when it comes to attractions and activities on its banks.You have the Eiffel Tower on the western end facing the Trocadero, as you go east you pass the Invalides, Pont Alexandra III, then the obelisk, later you come past Jardin Tuleries and the National Assembly, also pass by both Louvre and Musee d'Orasay. And then you finally come to the 2 islands which are the oldest settlements in Paris. All along you pass underneath various bridges, many of which have thousands of locks showing the pledges of many a lover. During summer months you'll find that the city administration puts up loads of deck chairs along the river for people to relax along the plage (beach).There are various companies which offer tours on the Seine and I would certainly opt for the night rides as Paris and especially the Eiffel tower look beautiful lit up. Go drench yourself in beautiful Paris."

We had just a couple of days in Paris and excellent weather (lucky us!), so the river boat tour was an excellent way to see a lot. It was hot and sunny for us on our one full day in Paris. We'd seen the Eiffel Tower the day we arrived, so that was checked off the list. In the morning we went to Jardin du Luxembourg and played in the playground there, then got lunch and a snack from a nearby boulangerie. Then we walked a bit and, given the heat and our kids (2 and 4 years) complaints of exhaustion, we decided to do something that involved sitting: a river cruise/tour. We didn't have to wait in line at all really. We bought tickets and got on an open top boat. It wasn't that full (off-peak season, mid-week, afternoon). It was pretty long - almost 2 hours - we were delayed by some kind of filming by the river on the way back. The boat tour moves along the river toward Notre Dame. Government buildings, Historical sites, and the many bridges are some of the attractions you see. Some of the bridges are quite old and the tour guide announcements mention this. The views of Notre Dame are beautiful from the river. The tour goes around the island and then heads back down the Seine toward the Eiffel Tower. And then turn around again to go back to the nearby dock. This was pretty great, because we could not have seen so much in such a short time any other way. The kids were thrilled that they could sit or walk around a bit without us fretting over the roads and traffic.It was truly a very pleasant experience floating down the Seine on a sunny day - just lovely.Even though the temperature was around 80F that day, it felt super-hot on the open deck of the boat. Take something to drink!!! I got a bit of sunburn. Granted I was not wearing block and should have been, but we didn't set out with a plan to go on the boat cruise. Wear sunblock!!!This is an excellent opportunity for photography. But all the passengers recognize this. So you'll need to stake out your spot, especially if the boat is a bit busy, to get an unimpeded shot."

Boarding and check in was well organized and we were guided to a table for two alongside a glass covered cupola allowing us to see everything along the river. The trip lasted over two hours, the food and wine were excellent-- not unlike a well recognized cruise ship meal. There was live entertainment and plenty of landmarks to see both in the sunset and in the dark. The program was hosted by Bateau Parisienne on the Diamant\u00e9.

The river is a magnetic drawcard from anywhere in Paris.It flows right through the heart of the city,bordering ten of the twenty arrondisements. Don't stand at street corners with a crumpled map trying to work out which side of the river bank ,you are standing on. The trick is, face down river,the Left Bank is on your left and the Right Bank is on your right. There are 32 bridges on the river some more impressive than others. The oldest ,Pont Neuf has been immortalized by artists,writers and the movies. Its a great place to hang out on a bench under the willow trees or sun bake on the embankments.Dont forget the mesmerizng treat of watching the boats float by. Another popular bridge is the Pont des Arts. Its made from metal and is entirely pedestrian. Stand here,gripping the rails and gape at the most stunning views of Paris. Look around and you will find it a great place to hang and use as a pick-me-up zone. People bring wine,and picnic whilst strumming guitars. The atmosphere is festive .  Below the bridge is a bee-hive of activity with joggers,cyclists,strollers and sunbathers making use of the elegant stone quays. The quays run along the entire length of the river. This is where 'Paris-beach' is.The river banks are always good for exploration,with floating houseboats,restaurants & cafes. Check out the various water levels from past floods and the giant iron rings to tie the river barges to the docks. The very best way to get the feel of the river is by boat. There are many boat tour operators offering services from taxi boats to private dining experiences. The leading company is Bateau-Mouches and another company explores the canal St.Martin. The batobus sails up and down the Seine from the Eiffel Tower to the Institute du Mondo Arabe with stops along the main attractions. Like a hop-on,hop-off bus,you can travel up and down the river at your pleasure."

The perspective from the river is much different than on the street. I wish I would've taken this the first day so we could've seen all the different options of interesting places. There is a beach area east of the Louvre and past Notre Dame on the left bank is a garden with dancing -- so cool! Instead of running around doing all the sightseeing, it would've been nice to just sit along the river at one of these spots and people watch."

On one side you have a quiter city, the Notre-Dame, the Mus\u00e9e D'Orsay, even close to the Tower it is more peaceful; on the other bank, you have traffic, shopping streets, the cafes, the Gares... it is really nice!

Our timing worked out great - after a nice tour down the Seine with audio of the sights along the way - our boat trip ended at the base of the Eiffel Tower right as it lit up! A sight to behold! On the boat - try to sit up front versus under the awning for an unencumbered view of famous Paris buildings that pass along on both sides. There is a bar on board and you can get a beer or chilled glass of champagne to enhance the trip! Not to be missed and it will give your feet a well deserved break!!

A lot of the prepackage tours bundle a tour of the river, with a visit to some place else, but I suggest you only do the river tour and do it right after visiting the Eiffel Tower. Make sure you have a camera capable of ISO 6400 or higher (for fantastic images) or with a strong flash (images are okay). It's good to familiarize yourself with the major landmarks ahead of time, so when the boat guide mentions a place or person, you'll have bnetter insight. My family really enjoyed the tour at dusk ...around 9:00pm-ish."

Like many cities that are governed by their river (e.g. Chicago, Montreal, etc. in the city of Lyon, one of the French culinary capitals, it has two rivers), Paris is no exception to the heart-beat created by the water that surrounds it. No need to do costly river boat cruises just walking the numerous bridges, spending time at any one of their piers is enough to experience how much the river has shaped the soul of Paris. Would recommend you walk across a number of significant bridges back and forth from various points along the left and right banks. Do so at various moments of the day and evening, early mornings, late nights. Have a meal at the many Parisian brasseries and taverns with their \"formule de jour\" and sense the rhythm of Paris - breathing life into its people. Amazing beauty."

It was a nice tour of the city in a nice air conditioned bus, and the extra money to not wait in line at the Eiffel Tower was worth it. But then they give you a ticket to go on a 1 hour tour of the Seine River at the \"orange\" dock. The boat was super crowded, no drinks, and very little air movement as it had a partial clear plastic ceiling. It was like being in a bus that held 550 people and every seat was taken and it was very packed. It was not a good tour, hard to hear the announcements in 5 different languages. Spring for a larger boat, with two floors, or perhaps a boat with dinner. We passed these boats and they looked much better. Or better yet, do not book with CityRama for the Seine River, but they did a good job with the city tour if you want a motorcoach and the Eiffel Tower. However, if you pay for the open double decker bus, there is no need to also see the city by motorcoach."

Whilst you glide under the bridges of Paris in a luxury glass-covered boat enjoying your dinner, an orchestra and singer will entertain you. You can even get up and dance to French and international classics. Bateaux Parisiens selection of delectable dishes prepared on board will inspire your pallet, not to mention the carefully chosen wines."

It was such a thrill to walk along the Seine with the sun glistening off the water and think of all the history that has taken place either on the water or along the shores. I appreciated all the bridges as they are a beautiful thing to see as well. I think the best way to take it all in is with a leisurely walk. Bike riding can be tricky because of the high number of pedestrian and auto traffick."

OK, it is a brown, working river fully entrapped in stone banks and there are way too many tourist boats buzzing up and down, But, it is the Seine, and it is Paris and there is so much history. It is worth a boat ride just to see the bridges from below (though do read up on them first). I used the Batobus service for a hop-on way to get around. Slower than the Metro (or walking) but a great way to see."

It's a good way to see a different side of Paris and apart from the opportunity to buy a romantic photo from the snappers that take everyone on the boat, it was a pleasant and worthwhile trip. The boats fill up quickly so get there early. The trip last about an hour and costs 13 euros and it's worth it. The commentary is good and sights are worth seeing. It's not something I'd do again, but once is a must. However, don't get tricked into having the luch or dinner cruise unless you fancy taking out a second mortgage or have money to burn."

The boat was encased in glass which was good because we had short amount of rain. it didn't matter to us. Everything was so amazing nothing else mattered. We bought the photos they took at our table and I'm glad we did - a great memory of a perfect trip. It wasn't cheap, but the food was great and it was worth every penny.The cruise was perfect. Paris was perfect. Put some effort into learning basic phrases and local culture, and try to blend in. Then you will have the best time ever.This was a couple's cruise feel - we had a dinner cruise. There were no little or loud children at all. So, if you are a family, check into this carefully because I'm sure any loud family would have received plenty of sneers."

Thus it is most enjoyable but would have been better with perhaps wine and a small meal. Ours did not have that. The river does seem to be a very busy waterway as barges and many tourist boats are seen. From our boat we could not see too much as tourist except the taller structures. Therefore one is more resign to just enjoy the ride itself. However if the boat we were on had an upper deck to be higher up, perhaps we could have seen more."

However, if you do not meet compatible fellow passengers and/or don't get Barbara as your guide, you will be disappointed. There is nothing to do on the boat, and our Cruise Director did the minimum. We booked one of the four suites on board and were comfortable. The bath was large for a boat. The regular cabins were \"cosy\". The food on board was above average, with the fish dishes very well done. Service however was rushed, and dining hours were annoyingly limited. Staff were uniformly friendly.

It can be enjoyed from bridges, the Ile de la Cit\u00e9 and Ile St Louis and from many points along the banks which give access to places to sit, contemplate and picnic. The volume of water passing through is also impressive and these days, the river is comparatively clean as the sewer service of the City of Paris cleans it of debris."

We took the cruise around 1500hrs after our lunch and it was not a clear sky nor sunshine day. The weather was like it can rain anytime.The cruise was ok - glass ceiling with around 200 seats and they had few seats in open air too. The day we went it was cold approx 14C so sat inside. The crew only spoke French with few basic english words. Had to listen to Audio guide which was not comfortable as the audio guide was heavy and in shape of mobile phone, so it was heavy after holding it for a while. So didn't bother listening after a while... Basically u see the view by the river for 1 hr. Starts and ends near Eiffel."

Close to its banks are so many iconic places that you will be seeing in Paris: Eiffel Tower, Grand and Petit Palais, Place de la Concorde, Musee d'Orsay, Musee de l\"Orangerie, Tuileries Gardens, the Louvre, Latin Quarter, Hotel de Ville, and more. Two islands in the river, especially the Ile de la Cite with the Notre Dame and Sainte-Chapelle but also the more residential Ile St-Louis. So many bridges, some plain, some fancy, some historic. A bridge called the Pont Neuf (or new bridge in Engish) but it's the oldest bridge still crossing the Seine and it connects the banks of the river with the Ile de la Cite. A bridge with a million locks on it that makes it sparkle. Walkways along the river with so many lovers walking hand in hand. The many boats that you can take for an hour cruise on the river. To the north side the Rive Droite or Right Bank. To the south side the Rive Gauche or Left Bank. Well, not every famous thing in Paris is next to the river but the Seine really is the center of the city in lots of ways. Plus you just can't miss it considering all the places that are next to it or in it or crossing it."

You see a totally man made river (only the water is natural), a lot of nice bridges (and one really ugly new one), the trees on the side, and a different view of the buildings (which look much better from down on the river). There are romantic walkways and island parks (Point Neuf is the primary one). This is the best outside attraction in Paris. But it varies dramatically from place to place. I like Ise de Cite and the opposite bank on Rive Guache the best.Be preared to walk. No handicap access to most areas. Access to food/drink is spotty. Access to toilets is non-existent."

HUNDREDS! It was the most horrible part of our honeymoon and we were stuck with it for an hour!I know it's not the staff's fault, but out of respect for other visitors, they should designate certain boats for field trips, etc. So if you decide to take this cruise (which would have otherwise been pleasant) be sure to get off and take the next boat coming."

A hint to disabled travelers - France is VERY welcoming for handicapped people - my husband walks with a cane, and when we arrived a staff member conducted him to a special area where he could sit down, and we were the first ones onto the boat (for best views, sit in the outside seats, closest to the bow of the boat). this was my favorite experience in Paris, just magical!"

So you had to sit on concrete to wait and wait to get the boat to go to Notre Dame. In addition, unlike the other boats on the Seine, this one has no commentary so you cannot identify what you are looking at. Lots of Euros to go one stop and never go on again! AVOID this rip off"

I have completed at least 10 plus and traveled all over the globe- as a solo traveler. I just came back from the cruise to Paris and Normandy.If you are a single woman..stay clear. This experience is not for you.The whole thing is basically fine until we go into the dining room. The Head Matri 'D is in charge of the open seating arrangement. On the first night there is a seating at a captains table . So far so good, right? The second night forward the head marches you around to seating and asks the diners if they would mind if you sit there? The diners look up from the table and shoo you off- sort of an excersize in utter rejection. Not bad if you like to be treated like a piece of meat. I think it might be more appropriate to inquire at a table then escort the woman to her seat. Then the next night when I am sick of this routine- I inquire if I could be seated with the other singles on board- his answer? \"I don't know who the solo travelers are\" This is from the Head Matri'D.I spent the last few days holed up by a window in the corner- now tired and defeated and dreading going into dinner. The other issue was I met 2 lovely ladies traveling together- sisters. One of them needed to be carted to an emergency room with stitches after falling down one of the departure ramps. The ramps were quite steep and carelessly placed with many elderly passengers- the ramps wet from the rain. All in all - I think the solo traveler can better spend their travel money in a better spot."

The sight of the majestic buildings and palaces on both the banks of the river : the massive Lovre complex, the Musee D'orsay area, the monumental Notre Dame cathedral , the sleek and sharp American Church, the legendary Eiffel Tower, the Alexander Bridge, the Assembly House, the golden top obelisk at Concorde Square would keep you mesmerized. In one bridge near Louvre, umpteen number of locks are tied on the railings would amaze you. On the opposite bank near Notre Dame cathedral, the shops dealing in old books would allure you. And, on the beautiful pavements on sides of the river Seine, you would watch people walking as the river flows. On completion of a round trip, you would enjoy some refreshments in the restaurant on Seine and think of another boat ride in the night."

It is a great way to see the city and definitely worth the price. For children 3 years and below, it's free. Would suggest you bring your own food or eat before the ride because the eateries around the area is expensive and serve lousy fast food (not comparable to McDonalds)."

It can be a little irritating because if you arrive late, you probably won't get a window seat. However, you are able to walk out on the deck and view the sites from there (if it's a sunny day. Unfortunately for us it was cold and rainy.). I noticed most cruises will go past the Louvre, the major bridges, Notre Dame and a few other key locations. It also provides a commentary out of a small, phone-like device that offers 9 languages. I can't say it ever got boring because I enjoyed the view. Things are very different from a boat perspective.

I went online and booked moulin rouge directly (it was a fabulous show, but a terrible start with lining up in the rain for an hour) and a week later they have STILL not refunded the nearly $700 AUS they have 'on hold' in my account. Not happy at all"

Absolute must to visit - we walked after dinner to the river at Pont d'Austerlitz [about ten minutes from the hotel] and the view to the north was of the rear aspect of the Cathedral at Notre Dame just beyond the Ile Saint-Louis not very far away. The lights of Paris and all along the river are magical in the evening. We crossed to the left bank and walked at leisure to the Jardins des Plants which is also well lit in the evening - along Quai Saint-Bernard, where we found the locals playing music and dancing on the river bank in about five separate areas - complete with picnic baskets of bread cheese and wines. How civilised is that ? The whole evening was enchanting - we sat and watched, and walked, and sat again. The Novotel was a welcome sight on our return at around midnight."

The land transportations was first class as Viking paved the way to your day of pleasure and education with first rate buses. The night before we docked in a City we were briefed by the Program director on what to expect and a brief cultural lecture on what we were to see. The head chef also spoke nightly, engaging us in what to expect for dinner. Viking is a first rate organization delivering a first rate vacation. Thank you and koodoos to the entire organization."

So we were informed that we would go in the opposite direction away from the city. In compensation we were offered two day ordinary boat trips along the Seine, valid for a year.Initially we were a little disappointed but found the trip out of the city quite interesting and rewarding.Generally we found the whole excursion very good. We were treated well. The staff were professional and friendly. The food was fine but not over generous, but there was plenty of bread to make the meal adequate.The on board musac was okay and the female singer pleasant and not over powering. Having a table next to the window made all the difference as you could observe many aspects of french life.In conclusion it was a memorable occasion"

After departing the boat I returned to the counter to ask what happened. It was a different woman working and she claimed my printout was no where to be found but due to the price I told her I paid online it was \"impossible\" I would have received a snack.

I am not sure how you can visit Paris and miss the Seine since it is right there in the heart of everything you would want to see. Even though we did take a night boat cruise, I found all the tour boats to be a bit distracting. It was also cold the night we went on the cruise so I really do not think I took it all in like i would have if I was not freezing. I would have loved to see the Seine the way the impressionists saw the Seine, but I guess I can just look at Sisley's works for that. Walking, crossing, boating or just gazing at it from above thinking of all the people who have come before you and will come after you is worth the nostalgic glance."

Walk along its banks and feel like you are in every movie you ever saw about the City of Light. Take a tour boat by all means. One in the daytime and for certain sure you must take an evening tour. See the lovers along the river strolling and kissing as the night comes. Watch all the wonderful buildings bathed in the lights of the city. There are small groups of musicians playing along the banks and families with a picnic spread on the ground. Float slowly under the magnificent bridges built to honor Queen Victoria and Napoleon. Have a heavenly view of Norte Dame as the sun is setting and the lights are casting shadows. It is everything you thought it would be and you should absolutely take time of the River Seine. Not just to make a few photos from atop an open tour bus, go to the river and step on a boat. Have a seat or have dinner. Have an adventure."

Starting at either Notre dame or the Bastille, run on the left bank not the right - the footpath is far more spacious. Also take one of the many tracks/roads down to run alongside the river bank. The gardens are lovely to run through , and less fumes. If you start at the Bastille, you can run along a canal off the Seine where the houseboats are moored, then cut across the iron bridge that operates as a lock to the right bank. You can also take in the romantacism of the lovers lock footbridge near Notre Dame."

It is two trips in one, daytime up the Seine to Notre Dam and pretty city lights and nightime on the way back down the Seine with the majesti Eiffel Tower all lit up! Two photo opps. The best boat is the one - if you are facing Trocodaro with your back to the Eiffel Tower, there is a carousel on the left, go down those stairs and take that boat. Sit on top out in the open - dress warmly!"

Also i noted that one elderly gentleman was very frail at the Moulin Rouge and the tour master talked to the managers of the place and got him into the Moulin Rouge early to sit down.

On the day in question 27th March, we found our way to the afternoon ''pick up' point by the canal. We went by Metro which in any case involved changing trains 3 times but then we found that one of the stations was closed meaning we did not stop and each had to buy a further single journey ticket to go a different route ( no one's fault but an aggravating factor when you are wasting your time!) we arrived and then using an inadequate map/plan (provided by Viator) we eventually found the meeting point with half hour to spare. It was very cold (again no one's fault but ...........). As the due time approached it became clear that something was awry there was nobody else waiting and then 20 further minutes past by and we gave up. Upon returning to the hotel and checking emails we found no cancellation. I sent an email asking for an explanation and refund. Back in UK and another week later with no reply I contacted Viator. I was told I had been sent a cancelation email and my account was refunded 2 days ago - 1st April (5 days after the tour date). I subsequently found the 'cancelation' a couple of pages into an apparently unsolicited email dated 17th March, trying to sell me other tour products. There was no 'sign posting' that this was a 'Cancellation of tour' email. Further - the email was a full 10 days before the tour date, meaning the refund when it came was over 2 weeks after the cancellation. I have no idea what the tour would have been like, we wasted half a day of a 4 day break, I would recommend going through anyone other than VIATOR. Btw the refund is still to show in my account but then it is still only 3 days since it was made."

Unlike the more famous Bateaux Mouches, which do a full narrated tour, the Batobus gives you hop-on, hop-off service for a full day or more, depending on the length of the pass you purchase. Although you don't get a narrated tour on the Batobus, you do get to ride in beautiful glassed-in boats, which provided much-needed protection from the freezing winds on the day we rode. I think the Batobus gives you a nice view of the city flanking the river, and a reasonably-priced form of transportation if you want to visit a number of tourist highlights in one day. I would even consider taking a Bateaux Mouches tour in addition to the Batobus, in order to learn more about al that can be seen from the water."

All the bridges and quays we saw were special in one way or another, but one of our most memorable times in Paris was watching the dancers at Square Tito Rossi on the Quai Saint Bernard on the left bank near the Jardin des Plantes on a Saturday night. Having read about it on a tourist website, I wanted to at least see it even if I didn't take advantage of the free tango lessons given in the early evening. We never did see any tangoers, but found instead a happy, eclectic throng folk dancing to a band composed of picturesque instruments while all manner of boats passed by. We spent a couple of hours on the stone steps watching the dancers and picnickers before moving on to try an ill-fated attempt at the Eiffel Tour, passing other groups with vastly different types of music along the way."

The food was upscale and good and they are very generous with the wine. There was a live combo that provided music that didn't overpower dinner conversation. You don't feel like you are on a boat as it is very steady. The overall atmosphere was very elegant. Most people were dressed up for the 8:30 dinner cruise.

Everyone was talking over the boat host and you could barely hear the guided tour on the head set. I was so disappointed as I had looked forward to this boat tour.I know of other people that had taken boat tours on the Seine and absolutely loved it. My suggestion to folks would be to look for the smaller tour boats or possibly a dinner cruise with folks that you can trust won't be yelling to each other from one side of the boat to another.

The 3 course meal was fantastic and very gourmet and there were 3 bottles of wine per table served. Our waiter did not speak much English but that was not a problem and he had a wonderful sense of humor that kept us laughing. We were pleasantly surprised to also find a lovely woman singing to us all with popular French tunes like La Vie On Rose that just added to the overall experience. The meal is preset when you pay for the cruise and I say definitly go before visiting the Eiffel Tower. Then sit back and enjoy."

We enjoyed browsing the riverside stalls selling pictures, posters, books and magazines. A really great way to see Paris either on foot or a river cruise. If the latter, buy your tickets in advance and queue 15 minutes before departure."

If you have plenty of time then you can walk along the riverbank and make little detours. We went and did the boat thing. There were places I wish it had been slower or could hve stopped but overall the boat is a good way to see the sights along the Seine and still take it all in. We got the Bateaux parisiennes. If you are French apologies on the spelling. You get the boat right at the Eiffel Tower pretty much. Recommend the bateaux parisiennes because you get 25% off with the Paris Visite card which I recommend you buy at the RER station at the airport or wherever you arrive. Eiffel Tower, Notre Dame, louvre, place de la Concorde and the rest all right there. A nice place to take it all in is the Trocadero. Probably wouldn't swim in it though!"

Interesting experience.Lovely way to orient yourself to life on either side of the Seine in Paris, especially just before dusk.Our boat ride began and ended near Notre Dame. It was conducted by a College Student (replete in her berret and pea coat) who was practicing her English. She was pretty good.Got to see the Eifel Tower lit up & we were close to it. The ride was nice. The explanations were good and enjoyable.If the weather permits you to go on top, do so as this way you have unobstructed views of either side of the shoreline.Realize that there are also \"Dinner Cruise\" versions of this on other boats. However, they are extremely expensive and not what we were looking for, especially with all of the great restaurants surrounding us."

On the first day of all my trips to Paris, directly off the plane, I head straight to the nearest section of the Seine and I walk along it to the Eiffel Tower. I recommend this to all visitors of the city. Not only does this allow you to get some blood circulating after a long flight, but it orients you to the layout of the city. Many of the city\u2019s landmarks can be seen from the river. Lining it is the Eiffel Tower, Invalides, Petite Palais, Grand Palais, Place de la Concorde, L\u2019Orangerie Museum, D\u2019Orsay Museum, Louvre Museum, and of course Notre Dame. In between the major landmarks are gorgeous, historic bridges and an occasional stretch of vendor stands that sell mostly print souvenirs such as cards, posters and magazines.The river tours can be hit and miss. Sometimes the boats are too crowded and in the summer the heat through the standard boat glass ceilings is unbearable. Make sure that you investigate before taking a cruise. You don\u2019t want a heatstroke or to find yourself without a seat for the duration of the cruise. I don\u2019t think I will ever take another cruise on the river because of these problems and also because\u2014unless you get on a hop-on/hop-off service\u2014you won\u2019t be able to investigate at your whim the many shops and stands that you pass. Worse, the bridges are best on foot, but you can\u2019t experience that on boat. Speaking of bridges, make sure to visit the Pont Alexandre III which is an ornate Art Noveau bridge between the Invalides (military complex with museum and Napoleon\u2019s tomb) and the Petite and Grand Palais. It\u2019s the most picturesque bridge in Paris\u2014with the Eiffel Tower as a distant backdrop. Another great bridge is actually a non-descript pedestrian wood-planked bridge (Passerelle Solferino, now called Senghor) that links the Tuileries Gardens with the D\u2019Orsay Museum. On the sides of the bridge are steel-fencing barriers--not pretty, but here lovers will attach a padlock with their names inscribed to the barrier fencing and toss the lock\u2019s key into the river below. The idea is that the lovers are permanently locked. Sweet! (Btw, I don\u2019t know if the city legally allows this. Lock at your own risk! But isn\u2019t love with it?)"

It is necessary to walk its banks and also take a cruise of some kind to fully appreciate the beauty of this magnificent city. We have walked the Left Bank from Notre Dame to the Eiffel Tower and returned via the Right Bank. This is only a portion of what one can do, but it allows you to soak up the unique atmosphere of Paris and appreciate its beauty.Each time we have visited Paris our strolls across and between Pont Neuf and Pont des Arts has provided us with the opportunity to purchase original artwork from local artists, painting on the street. They may not be Monet artwork, but they are original and provide us with a wonderful reminder of what we have seen and enjoyed.There are many tourist cruises that are available to tourists. We bought a two day BatoBus ticket which is a \"hop on-hop off\" system. It stops at eight wharfs during its round trip of The Seine and accesses the major attractions in Paris. We thought it was great value, and although there is no commentary, it is an efficient and quick way to get to and from destinations, particularly if time or weather becomes an issue.Paris is, (and I am not telling anyone something new), a beautiful, exciting and unique city. Using The Seine, as part of visiting this city, is an integral part of the experience."

Few capitals effortlessly define themselves like Paris. On my latest trip I discovered one more reason to believe this place continues to punctuate its place on the map.Take Pont des Arts. A pedestrian \u201cpedestrian\u201d bridge over the Seine near Pont Neuf, transformed from a utilitarian viewpoint into a statement living up to its name. Someone got the idea that attaching graffiti in the form of padlocks might make an interesting art exhibit. Simple in concept, complex in execution, the wire mesh railings are now covered in locks with names of lovers inscribed as a symbol of eternal connection and love. Voila. Masterpiece.You can spend hours perusing the collection, studying, photographing, dreaming about what the owners committed to with their act of public declaration. It is an art installation extending the Parisian perspective to street level. The city, for its part, embraces these acts of defacement in exchange for an expansion of its own identity. What a pleasure to sit there in the middle of the span and feel the harmony surrounding you. Go, feel, act. Bring your love and your lock and make a stand on the Pont des Arts for the world to see."

We visitied Rouen and Les Andelys and other towns. Rouen is a lovely town with a wonderful old square. We saw were Joan d'Arc was burnt. There are many timbered houses - Norman style.Les Andelys is a beautiful very old village. There is a more modern town of Les Andelys but we didn't go there. Richard the Lionheart built a castle in the town. We found a wonderful bakery and a shop called Tapestry (I think). Great shop.The river is a very worthwhile visit. We are happy we did it. Seeing the countryside was beautiful."

It is worth doing no matter what. You see a different view of Paris this way. Our trip took an hour round trip. I think there are very expensive dinner cruises available and longer reiver trips, but for us, the one hour solution was fine."

Paris provides a potpourri of the senses, and the Seine most of all. I highly recommend a boat ride (which you can research in the forums here to decide which one suits you best) at the time of day or night you wish. We bought our tickets online, at a discount, before we left and were able to choose the day and time while we were there. We chose a 9:30 pm cruise for the lights--especially the ones that twinkle on the Eiffel Tower. We did not want a dinner cruise, as the food reviews did not seem promising. Whether you stroll, boat, or picnic by the banks, the Seine awaits you!"

Best duck fois gras I've ever had and a wonderful gazpacho soup. Seeing the Eiffel tower lit up at night from the boat was spectacular, much more impressive than in daylight. What impressed me was how many Parisians are along the riverbank at night at cafes etc. or just strolling. And most of them waved at the boat! There was entertainment on the boat and the singer was lovely though her choice of music I felt could have been better. I would have preferred songs like \"Je suis Malade\" over Adele. She certainly had the chops to sing like that. All in all I loved, loved, loved this excursion."

Whenever I\u2019m visiting a place I always try to make my way down to the water in the afternoon, when the light is the best for photography. Paris may be the best place to get those pictures of the sights, capturing some of the water in the shots across the river. We spent a great deal of time walking along the bank of the river on our visit. I\u2019d read in two Paris guide books that you can catch a river cruise down beyond Notre Dame Cathedral and take it to the Eiffel Tower. After a very long day of sightseeing and walking way beyond what we were up to, we learned that this information was completely false. After finally reaching the dock where we had read we could board the sightseeing boat we learned that you can only board the boat at the Eiffel Tower end of the cruise and that the boat will take you down to the Notre Dame dock, turn around in mid river, without stopping and then take you back to the Eiffel Tower starting point. This was very discouraging and we had to just stop and rest for some time along the river while we formulated a new plan. Once we finally found the nearest metro station we made our way to the Eiffel Tower dock, determined that we were going to get a river cruise in if it killed us. In the end, we did get our cruise down to Notre Dame and back. We were exhausted, my wife wouldn\u2019t even get out of her seat during the whole cruise of about an hour, but it was beautiful to watch the sights of Paris slip by as we sat there on a sightseeing boat. I took more pictures during that hour than any other on the whole trip and just maybe the sun was in an even better position as the light for photography seemed perfect. Maybe those people who told me sightseeing along the river in Paris is the best thing to do."

We went in Mid Sept and took a tour at night. Its beautiful to see the city lights at night and the Effiel Tower all lit up. I recommend bringing a heavy sweater or jacket for the night tour."

These 3 intersecting bus routes have 1,2 or 3 day tickets and we found we could get to most tourist areas by using these. Better than Metro as you spend more time with things to see and that is what we were there for.The Batobus cruise was slightly disappointing. Views OF the Seine are better than views FROM the Seine, due to the narrowness of the river and the high paved banks, but done this way it is good value and convenient. The boarding point at Musee d'Orsay is a bit hard to find. Make sure you have the right bridge."

You can get a ticket which lasts 48 hours and the boat has eight designated stops along the Seine from the Eiffel tower, the Louvre, Musee D'Orsay and up past Notre Dame. Boats leave each stop every half hour with the last boat about 7pm (check timetable). One big word of warning - PICKPOCKETS! We had the unfortunate experience of having my wife's purse (credit cards, licence, cash etc) taken from her bag as she paid for tickets at the Batobus ticket box beneath the Eiffel tower. Groups work this area and pick their targets so be extra vigilant with your belongings. If you are in a queue, don't be pushed and shoved as the body contact is what distracts you from noticing your belongings are being targeted."

Good food, lovely atmosphere, and the scenic Paris going by on the other side of a window. But now I like more local & authentic experiences so I prefer to sit along the river as those same cruises go by.For those of you looking for a more authentic, and perhaps youthful, experience: try a pic-nic (or better yet: a night-time pic-nic) along the river's edge. Pick up some small items from a grocerie store (baguette, wine, cheese, biscuits, whatever). I don't know about the day, but I know that at night you won't be alone! It's a very popular place for young Parisians to meet.Right down on Quai de la Tournelle was my favourite spot at night. (you can Google Map the name or Notre Dame and you'll see the quai just on the other side of the river from Notre Dame Cathedral). The cathedral is lit up across the river & the lights from the cruise boats light up the area as they pass.Average crowd: local ParisiansAverage age: mid-20's early 30'sAverage atmosphere: friendly, joyful, often friends jamming with instrumentsThough it's night and there is drinking, I've never felt in danger there. It's quite busy on weekends with plenty of people around."

Even if you don't have time to take a cruise, just enjoy a casual stroll on both sides - Rive droit and Rive Gauche (the right and left side of the Seine). There are small vendors along the side selling paintings, drawings, and little keepsakes of Paris. You can stop by a cafe along the way for a croissant and a cafe au lait. Make sure sure you go down the bridge that has all the \"love locks\" along the side of the bridge. You write your name on the padlock, lock it around the bridge wires on the side and then throw out the key in the Seine, that way your love lasts forever. That's what they say anyway. Whichever way you go in Paris, you will inevitably hit the Seine. To go from the Louvre which is on Rive droit to the Latin Quarter which is on River gauche, you have to cross the Seine. And that's just one example. Oh - and make sure you take a picnic with you one day and sit along the side of the Seine like so many other Parisians do. You can even bring a bottle of wine. Enjoy the food, take in the surroundings, and just fall in love with Paris! :)"

The areas arount the Cite ares thronged with people, not only on the quays, but also on the multitude of enormous cruisers which seem to be a big draw for tourists, both day and night. in fact Paris as a whole and the river in particular are remarkably unspoiled since I first visited 50 years ago. A stroll along the banks, crossing the many beautiful bridges is a must. What has improved are the embankments alonh the whole length of the Seine in Paris. Not as much fun as the South bank in London, but still, most attractive."

Don\u2019t let the title put you off as I thoroughly enjoyed walking down both banks from the Eiffel Tower to Bercy. My main gripe is that stretches of the walls and fences are covered with tall wooden boxes that vendors use to sell everything from books, paintings and the usual tourist tat. As I am not 2m tall these boxes obscured the views and detracted from the overall enjoyment of the surroundings. It was made worse by the fact that many appeared not to be in use. Perhaps the local authority should remove those not in use.The big plus of walking along the Seine is that you find places that you would not see from a boat."

If you can do it at night, even better since the City of Lights really does glow after the sun goes down. We did an afternoon tour with Bateaux Parisians (right across from the Eiffel Tower) and found their boat/guides to be very nice. Unfortunately it begain to rain just as we boarded the boat, but their inside coverage is nicely done with clear glass so you stay dry while still being able to view the sights. On a previous trip, we did the night cruise on a March evening with Bateaux-mouches and it was very cold outside on the upper deck. Be sure to consider the weather when booking a tour, but don't hesitate to cruise the Seine if you get the chance."

The sites are so much easier to see in person on the street, instead of on this massive river boat tourist trap. There are just throngs of people and the give the tour in about 8 different languages and it is really annoying. If they would just stick to French, English and maybe Japanese or Spanish it would be so much better. Or break up the trips into different times for different languages. Having to listen to the same sentence in 8 different languages is so bothersome-they could be spending more time talking about thing as you go by, but since they have to say the same thing 8 different ways, there is no time to say much. I didn't like the tour, however, it was cheap, like $13 USD."

This does not just include young people, its all ages. It seems to be so natural, obviously it is something that has been done for years.We have seen stalls set up, dance lessons taking place, dance groups setting up.

I'd love to see it in summer with the temporary beaches set up. Don't go expecting to see lovely clean blue water - you wont see that, but it is still one of the best locations to visit in Paris.

If you have more time in Paris and intend to visit more attractions then I would recommend you the Batobus that has stops next to most important attractions in Paris. You can have one day pass for just 15 euro and jump on and off whenever you want. A full tour (let\u2019s say you start and end at Eiffel Tower) takes about 80 minutes. Main stations are: Eiffel Tour, Orsay Museum, Saint German des Pres, Notre Dame Cathedral, Jardin des Plantes (Plants Garden), Hotel de Ville (City Hall), Louvre Museum, Avenue Champs Elysees/Triumph Arc, Eiffel Tower.If you do not have time to jump on and off the batobus you might consider dinning on the Seine. There are other companies that have restaurants on their ships so make an advance reservation.Whatever the reason and how you\u2019ll cruse the seine, the pleasure and the memories will remain forever."

Timing this with the lighting up of the Eiffel tower is a lovely activity to do (the tours have a built in audio guide explaining the history of the monuments you pass as you move down the river). As you travel down the river, you will see hundreds of Parisiennes with Wine and full on picnics having either romantic picnics or small parties with friends. My second recommendation for the river would be to join them!"

While there are plenty of tour boats (some very fancy and some rather utilitarian), I'm not sure if it really makes a difference since the views are what really counts. I'd highly recommend making this one of your first things to do when visiting Paris. You get a little history, but more importantly, you'll get an idea of the lcoations of some of the city's major sites. Even in the rain (most boats have both interior and exterior seating), it's quite beautiful."

That said, we felt pretty rushed through dinner. It was a 2 hours cruise but there were several courses. The menu was extremely limited, with the only entree choices being cod and veal (you could order steak for an extra 10 euro but we'd already paid 140 euro for 2 dinners). Honestly, I would say the food was just average. Not quite what I expected for $85 per person. We only had the opportunity to go to the top deck and look around from outside the boat because we ate quickly. There was no time to enjoy a drink on the deck unless you skipped part of your meal. The only other problem I had was that the cruise company employs photographers to come around during dinner and take posed pictures of you in an attempt to get you to buy the pictures. This was annoying and a cheap attempt to get even more money out of us. It wasn't just us-other guests were obviously uncomfortable and put off by this and it really ruined the atmosphere. Overall, the cruise was nice but for the amount we paid, I was hoping for more. As a note, it was billed as a \"night tour\" but in the summer, don't expect to see the city lights. It doesn't get dark until 10-11pm so don't expect an illuminated Eiffel Tower. Overall, the boat was beautiful and it we did have a fun experience. It didn't seem like a great value for the quality of food and duration of the excursion-even an extra 30 min would have been great to get to enjoy the deck."

We took a boat cruise on the Seine at Sunset -- it was the perfect ending to our week in Paris -- and definitely one of the highlights of our trip. We went at sunset when you can clearly see all of the sights along the river and when the buildings on either side of the Seine are being lit up for evening viewing. It was also wonderful to see people sitting and/or picnicing along the sides of the Seine. We went on the 10 pm cruise and as we were returning (1 hour cruise), the Eiffel Tower was lit up and then twinkled for a few minutes (at 11 pm it twinkled for about 5 minutes) -- it was majical. If you take the 10:30 pm tour, you will be too far down the Seine to see the Eiffel Tower twinkle. Don't miss it twinkling -- it was truly spectacular! There are several companies that run boat cruises. We took Bateau Parisien. It was fine (just show up and pay or it is included with a Paris Pass) and casual and there is a head set (many languages) to listen to a narrative of the sights and some French music as you sail on the Seine. I didn't give it an \"excellent\" rating because on the Bateaux Parisien boat we were on there was a group of 25+ 12-14 year olds and they were totally obnoxious standing at the sides of the boat, yelling and hollaring to bystanders to get their attention, and ruining the enjoyment for others. While it was not the fault of the Bateaux Parisien company that these children were misbehaved, the staff did absolutely nothing."

I did note that it was quite silty, seemed to flow faster than most rivers I was accustomed to on the east coast of the united states, and found it fascinating as it flowed north, which not many rivers I'm used to do. I walked along it for hours and enjoyed the views of the city at night from its banks and I'll certainly do it again next time I visit."

We went with Bateaux Mouches. Although we were among the last to board, there were still many open seats on the upper deck. There was some narration of the sights, be we paid no attention to that. Just gliding down and back up the river and enjoying the views was more than enough for us. This was an afternoon cruise and the weather was just great, so our spirits were high too. I suppose that the city lights at night give you much different views, but in the daytime you can see all the details in the various buildings, museums and monuments. We very highly recommend river cruises."

A one hour cruise costs from Euro 18 upwards depending on what you want included in the package. (drink , snack, etc)....Well priced for the duration and the ambience.The cruise takes you down the river and under 22 of the many bridges across the river. There is running commentary in 3 languages (French, English and Spanish), which is very informative. It covers most of the important attractions like the Notre-Dame, Louvre, Ile de la Cite etc.The bridges are so beautifully architectured and each bridge has a story to tell. The sculptures on each bridge are stunning. When we got off, there was a troupe of performing dancers (male dancers in female costumes) dancing enthusiastically - I guess this is really not a regular feature there.... There are little cafes around the boarding point - so you can grab a snack or coffee too after disembarking.The weather, however, needs to be perfect - we went on a beautiful Saturday evening with the sun shining brightly till late in the night. The very next day however, it was pouring heavily.... So do keep the weather in mind before you make arrangements for this cruise."

Or if you wanna be insane, then spend \u20ac11,50 and take a Bateaux Mouches river cruise in the Seine. The journey will take an hour and 10 minutes passing under about 20 of the 38 bridges that span the River and allowing you to view the monuments up close. You will head down towards the two islands and circle back towards Eiffel Tower. Can you tell which is the right bank and which is the left, and which is port and which is starboard? =PDuring summer time, there are no illuminations cos of the long daylight hours although the Eiffel Tower is lit after 930pm. Regardless, it's a tradition for me to take the boat each time I am in Paris. It's still the City of Love even if it is not the City of Lights. =)"

Eiffel Tower was spectacular especially with the added bonus (you have to see it - so I wont spoil the surprise) and was really fun with appropriate music played at certain sights.

We are staying in the oldest part of Paris - the Latin Quarter, left bank. It's an easy walk to the Seine and the grounding centerpiece of the city - Notre Dame. The bridge we cross to Ile de la cite (one of the two islands in the Seine & the one that Notre Dame is on) is the bridge with the love locks (a colorful variety of padlocks added by lovers from around the world). In two days we've already seen brides on the bridge being photographed, students picnicking beside the water, and varios tourist boats traversing the waterway. Our favorite was a boat playing loud upbeat music while a Zumba class danced wildly on deck! The bride between Ile de la cite and Ile St Louis (the second small island) is one that's always full of performance artists -usually musicians. We've even seen two pianos rolled out on the bridge for a jazz ensemble. Visual artists also set up to sketch those walking by. Many of the big museums are on the Seine - such as the Louvre and the D' Orsay. Great photo ops are had from the opposite banks from these magnificent structures. .We plan to take an evening boat ride before we leave to see the \"city of lights\" at her best (though in early June its light until 10 pm). The Seine is a great place to begin and end your trip to Paris."

A stroll along the river, in any of the many places where sidewalks are available, will allow you to see the river, its bridges, the boat traffic, the city, and other people in a different way. Standing on a bridge and watching the flow of river traffic offers great photos, with one or another of the many monuments of Paris in the background. In my view, a boat ride sounds good but proves frustrating in practice. You are very low on the river, and often can only catch a glimpse of the tops of monuments, and other buildings lining the river."

There are37 bridges over the Seine in Paris each with it's own history, character and appeal, how can these be reviewed as one entity? Since 2002 parts have been classed World Heritage sights, so it can't be that bad. Being in Paris for 3 weeks I walked the river from Parc Monceau in the west to Bercy in the east, on different days. The views have been a look at the history of Paris and it's architecture , culture and soul. End of sermon!"

A work colleague and I had one night in Paris and neither of us had been there before and thought an hour long cruise down the Seine would give us a good flavour of the city.We opted for a cruise with a glass on champagne for \u20ac18, but you can just do the cruise for \u20ac12. They also offer ones with some food, but I wouldn't bother from what I could see was on offer once we were on the boat. The champagne was of decent quality though and worth the extra \u20ac6.We got on the boat at 10:30pm and I would definitely recommend seeing the Seine at night. All along the Seine there were hundreds, if not thousands of young people (late teens to 20's I'd say) sociallising with a bottle of wine and maybe a bit of food. There were more and more of them the closer we got to Notre Dame. There was music and a wonderful atmosphere created by them.We did the first part of the boat trip on the top of the boat, listening to the recorded sightseeing tour and then when the boat turned round we went downstairs for our champagne and sat out on the front of the boat.It was a lovely warm night and a lovely experience I plan to repeat when I go back with my husband."

Good thing I had already seen many sights the 2 days previously. The company was Bateaux Parisiens. The cost was 12 Euros and it departed from the base of the Eiffel tower and ended back at the Eiffel tower with the amazing view. I recommend you go near the end of the day but while it is still light outside so the sunlight dances on the water. Very pretty and romantic. People on the shore wave at you. You can see people on Ile de la Cite and Ile St. Louis along the shore which made me go back there and enjoy the park/shore. People picnic there and just hang out. I saw ducks and even a swan in the Seine. If you just walk along the Seine, there are some parts that smell like urine. Homeless people often sleep under bridges. You can see sleeping bags and their belongings. I didn't feel in danger though. Maybe at night, I would have felt differently. If you take pictures along the Seine, they all look postcard perfect."

Even though it was raining when my husband and I visited Paris, it couldn't stop us from a seine river cruise. I strongly recommend the \"autobus\" where you can get on and get off at your leisure in a one day period all for one price. It really gives you a perspective of the city in one day, and allows you to do a lot if time is an issue for your travel to Paris."

The trouble is the concept itself: most of the trip is spent in the locks which are interesting, to a point. There are just too many of them and it gets to to be same ole same ole fairly quickly. And there are the tunnels. Too many, too long. Another quirk, if you want to do a sail by of the Eiffel Tower, this ain't it. That's in the other direction. The boat could go down river a bit, but it doesn't. And Notre Dame, well, that's nearly straight up and you see the towers but you can do that on just about any bridge in Paris.

On the not-so-cool side, these boats often become booze cruises filled with loud raucous partying teenagers. There are other dinner boat cruises which are likely calmer more idyllic ways to float down the historic Seine if you're interested in a little cruise. I also recommend grabbing a baguette, cheese and a bottle of wine and wandering down for a little picnic on the edge late afternoon or early evening.

It can only be accessed from the middle of the bridge on the west side, down narrow stairs. There is another small park on the south bank opposite ile de la cite that is also rather nice and more modern. There is a great walk along the barges on the north side of the river just beyond the obelisque. All these places get you away from traffic noise.Pont Solferino is a pedestrian only bridge communicating with the center of the Tuileries that shouldn't be missed."

However, we got the bir hakeim metro back to our hotel and there are massive gangs of pickpockets hanging around that area. We saw one in action and it was frightening.

In summer its a wonderful place for an evening picnic; the Paris Plage is a brilliant idea, and creates a lovely atmosphere. But can anything realy detract from the wonderful archtecture and history that line its banks. Last week I took a boat from Tour Effel for the round trip to Notre Dame and Ile Saint-Loius. Spring flowers, fresh greenery, the exquisitely pollarded trees and the blossoms of sweet and horse chestnut were delightful. "

However, as my back was toward the opening and my desire to relieve myself was most important \u2013 I ignored thisI obtained Instantaneous relief and pleasure ensued as I enjoyed the comfort of this \u201cTo-Be-Cleaned facility....Upon the near completion of my task, a female voice said something about \u201c5 seconds\u201d But I have not yet finished \u2013 I said to the wall.....Then, I wondered what was in the Red Wine they gave me on board the cruise ship?The toilet pan tilted backwards and disappeared into the wall behind it. Horror thoughts ran through my mind as to what would have been my fate if I had been seated at this moment?I then adjusted my clothing and turned to leave the oval structure...But \u2013 Madame Paris had not quite finished with my embarrassment....A Siren Alarm started to activate \u2013 I am sure it would have been heard at Versailles.... I quickly exited and started to blend in with the crowd, hoping sincerely that I would not be tapped on the shoulder by \u201cLe Loo Police\u201dThe rest of our day was most uneventful, I guess......Some may say that this could only happen to a Grandad......

This some what small musical interlude genuinely added to the romance of the River Seine.A must again for all romantics regardless of age."

The farther you walk, the more Parisian you feel! This said, I offer a serious word of warning regarding safeguarding your possessions (especially at the entrances and exits to the bridges). These places are rife with young bands of pickpockets who are quite skilled at their \"craft.\" The usual ruse is for a couple of teens to shove a clipboard with a \"charitable\" petition to sign and, while one is engaged in avowing disinterest, the pickpocket sneaks up silently (and totally unnoticed) from behind, unzips your handbag, removes and steals your wallet, zips up the handbag...all in a mere few seconds. My daughter was the victim and her small, shoulder-strap purse was held tightly under her arm! We were extremely lucky that only a few euros were stolen before the wallet was discarded and retrieved by a good samaritan who turned it into the police station. There is signage posted all over the main attractions in Paris advising travelers to be aware of pickpockets. Of course, we thought we were! Our story ended well...most do not, according to the police. I still say the walk along the Seine is worth the potential aggravation. The best suggestion I can offer is to NOT carry any personal items or ID where they are visible. This will also leave your arms free to swing as you enjoy the sights along the River Seine!"

I just noticed that most of these reviews are about a river cruise ride, but I wanted to suggest a walk along the river, I feel that this is a must for all travelers visiting Paris. If it's a nice day, take a stroll along the river and watch the boats, cyclists and people passing by. It's another simple way to people watch and soak in the sights and sounds of this great city. Maybe take a break and enjoy a quick 'picnic' at one of the many benches along the way and then press on heading either east or west. My girlfriend and I did this walk from the Eiffel Tower to the Musee d'Orsay, and then to the islands for Notre Dame/Saint Chapelle."

I guess the guide books say its better to stay at street level than down next to the river for walking, which make sense since so many movie scenes next to the river end up in gun battles. Its not that bad, but for safety's sake a lot harder to push someone in the water from street level, and more traffic to keep people honest. A boat cruise, and dinner is the way to see it from the river level and plenty of wonderful views looking up as well."

We passed because it was too late in the evening, but those who went reported that the food was poor and the cruise was freezing! We walked along the River on several occasions, moving between walking tours, museums, and churches. We enjoyed the used book dealers, and bought a lock to put on the wire bridge (best ones for photos are by the Louvre or by Notre Dame). The idea is that you put the lock on the bridge to symbolize your love, and throw the key into the Seine so that it can never be found and your love unlocked. We didn\u2019t bring a lock, but purchased one from one of the street vendors. The key didn\u2019t work with the lock \u2013 but the gesture was romantic! We also found on the bridges that the scammers were out in full force! A lady pretended to find a wedding band, asked if my husband lost it, then asked him to buy it."

This is the heart of Paris, and where it began (Point zero is on the island where Notre Dame is). We stayed near Notre Dame, and thoroughly enjoyed our walks along the Seine both during the day and at night with all the buildings lit up. During the day, you have all the tourist to gawk at (us included!), and during the night (which during January was dark by 4:45pm) it seems you have the place all to yourselves. There's a sidewalk all along both sides of the river at street level, and with the countless bridges (well, you can count them on a map if you want), it's easy to switch banks and get a different perspective. There are also sections of river level walkways (mainly for the boats docked along the bank) that give you a fantastic view of the river and different perspective of the sites. We didn't do a river cruise (too rainy and cold most of the time we were there), but will consider it the next time. We noticed that many of the bridges were clogged with padlocks on their railings. It turns out that these are \"love\" locks, where lovers would inscribe their names on the lock, attach it somewhere on the bridge, and throw the keys into the river as a symbol of their love and commitment. I'll hold my opinion on this subject, but it does make for interesting pictures."

The evening tour can also be excellent for the lights but for me it was harder to view the buildings, so this is much better for a dinner on the river which is expensive and leaves little time to look out.

A bateux mouche (open air boat ride) is a must down the River Seine in Paris before you visit any monument or museum as it will offer you a perspective of the city that you can't experience. One must sit in the outside top level of the boat to experience the architect of the buildings and monuments. It is narrated in French and English, but with a small handy map as your guide, you are able to identify all the buildings and monuments the boat passes through. The Bateaux Mouche at Pont de l'Alma passes over at a replica of the Statue of Liberty that France gave United States as a gift and turns around to pass the Eiffel Tower- a front row view, especially wonderful at sunset time. The boats run every 20-30 minutes during the summer and tickets can be purchased in advance via on-line, very convenient as you do not have to wait in any line to purchase them. You are able to purchase some sandwiches/baguettes right before entering the Bateaux Mouches at the vendors and bring the food aboard. There are restrooms aboard the boat as well. The 1 1/2 hr. cruise is definitely well-worth it, even if you only have a few hours in Paris! During the summer you can even see the \"Paris Plage\" activities along the Seine-- mid-July - mid- August. Lots of great photo opportunties aboard."

            "review": "Not quite the Thames. I feel a bit silly trying to rate a river, but let's give it a go.When thinking about the Seine in this context one really needs a good comparator, and for me there is none better than the River Thames in London.One of the best things about the Thames is its accessibility and utility, for tourists and Londoners alike. Somehow the Seine falls down here. Granted, there is no shortage of sightseeing cruises, but there is (currently) nothing akin to the Thames Clipper river bus, and little to take one beyond the traditional Notre Dame - Tour Eiffel stretch. A great river really needs great accessibility, and the Seine just doesn't cut the (French) mustard.If you can't get onto the river then you at least want to walk by it. In London this is easy, with traffic-free paths running almost all the way from Lambeth Bridge to Tower Bridge. In Paris things aren't so simple - unless one is lucky enough to find one of the very few tow-paths in the centre, you will be forced to enjoy your river views with choking traffic either immediately beside you or even between you and the waters. There are a few exceptions to this, such as the point where the two sides of the Seine, separated to encircle the Isle de Cite, once more rejoin - but these seem few and far between.So, if you can't get on the water, or walk beside it without choking on traffic fumes, can you at least sit next to it? Well, in my (albeit less-than-exhaustive) experience, in general you cannot. That's not to say you can't sip a beer and see the water at the same time, merely that the aforementioned roads and congested traffic (not to mention street furniture, parked vehicles and trees) will almost certainly have the better view! London (and I'm sorry to harp on about this) does this at least slightly better (though I confess not perfectly) with cafes, restaurants and pubs dotted along South Bank.From reading this one might get the idea that I don't like the Seine, or fail to recognise its importance in the overall cityscape. On the contrary the Seine clearly provides a vital role, funnelling not only its constituent waters, but also significant rail and road thoroughfares through the heart of the city. It also acts as a vital focal point for people (much as the Thames does in London), drawing people to its banks and framing the buildings and monuments along its length. In the best Parisienne tradition it is a great boulevard, a place to see and be seen, a place to be and a place to travel along. It is an entity which cannot be missed ... so long as you don't mind sharing it with the traffic!"

Not only do you get the amazing architecture Paris possesses but you see the Parisians being themselves along the way. While every body is looking at the landmarks I was also people watching along the banks of the river. You see the people partying on the banks and dinner boats. It is amazing what you can see just sitting in a boat for an hour."

The area around Notre Dame is really scenic and you can spend a lot of time wandering along the river bank and visiting shops and bars. It is a good place to get photos from and you need to visit the bridge that has all of the locks on it. At the end of the island is a memorial called 'Martyrs Frandai de la Deportatien'. It does not not appear in some of the tourist books, but it is worth a visit."

The best advice is ignore & keep walking... I don't think the scam is much more than an elaborate form of begging (and you may well see sleeping bags for the homeless under some of the bridges so some sympathy is inevitable). I have NEVER felt physically threatened by such people in Paris (UK beggars can be so much more physically intimidating although a violent disposition is uncommon amongst such people in France).Whether you do just give a Euro or two is down to your own judgement (but don't bother if it means dragging your wallet or purse out, as who knows... it might get swiped).. Watch your pockets at all times but don't let it spoil your fun...My advice is just to be careful, and try to enjoy any such experience as part of the wondeful quirkiness that is Paris..."

Visit the Monoprix or other grocery store nearest your hotel, and pick up a bottle of wine (don't forget a cork screw), a baguette and a wheel of brie. If you want to make the evening even more authentically Parisian, pick up your baguette at a local boulangerie (baker) and the cheese at un fromagerie (cheese shop). Take the Metro, line #4 and get off at Cite. Stroll down to the Left Bank, around Notre Dame for the best sights and most enthusiastic company. You'll find the river bank lined with Parisians and other tourists, also with wine, bread and cheese in hand, celebrating the wonder of spending a night in this beautiful place.

The extreme beauty of River Sense, however, might not be easily discovered with one trip alone. Thankful to experiencing the river thrice on 3 different means of transportation, I brought home a full-pledged sense of this wonder-landscape.1. My first touch onto River Sense was in the morning when I walked along the north west starting from the Eiffel Tower on the New York Ave to the Notre Dame. It took me 3 hours to pass strings of adorable landmarks. Among were Pont de Alexander III the most sophisticated bridge round the globe, Concorde Square with Egypt Obelisk, Tuleries Garden where you can view Montmartre, Museum Louvre, Pont de Art with myriad love locks while the magnificent Notre Dame is on the historic island where the first Paris was found and emerged towards the 2 banks of River Sense. Roam and pause till you learn some historic remarks of the river.2. River Sense becomes most dynamic and happening during the lunch time. On the bus from Luxembourg Garden via Latin Quarter and Saint Michel to Champs Elysee, I found the river turns out to be the center of Parisian life. Hoards of tourists, businessmen, students and retirees were strolling, boating, fishing, reading, eating and resting there as if it were their second home ever since.3. The best is yet to come though. The sun goes down to let River Sense shine best. Taking a boat at the Pont Neuf from 8pm to 9pm, I watched the City of Light changing its hues along sparkling River Seine. Romance feeling, music and unpotrayable Eiffel Tower by night would be simply among the fantastic await you thereon. You ought to enjoy the view to the fullest when the boat embarks in the sunset because the Seine would be not the same when you come back."

If you ever want to reconsider that take the cruise on River Seine, I opted for the Paris City Pass (which I highly recommend) and the river cruise was a part of the trip. The Bateaux Parisiens River Cruise was a part of the cruise and I really enjoyed it, it was pretty cold and the river cruise runs ferry every half hour. Every ship has a glass enclosure a and a deck. I was travelling with my friend and we both chose to sit on the deck although it was cold there were fewer people and we could take in Paris unlike the rest of the trip. The beauty of Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay and generally the banks of the Seine remains unparalleled in my memory. We availed to the Enchanting Tour and was very satisfied with it.The trip originates from Eiffel tower and runs every half hour, if you are using the Paris City Pass you can just hop in, for all others it is pretty easy to buy a ticket just before hopping on. I suggest that you take the trip around 5.00 pm it is a very good time considering the colors of the sky are changing which generally makes it prettier"

            "review": "A nice introduction to the area. No matter how much time you spend in Paris, the Seine becomes an important reference point for locating where you are relative to anywhere else, either visually or on a map. It snakes through the center of the city past many major sites, and so it makes sense, then, that a cruise along the river is considered a must-do event, romantic even. Having done this twice, here is what we have learned: 1) It's a relatively inexpensive and quick way to get the lay of the land and see several monuments (from a distance). 2) Crowded boats can hamper your enjoyment of the cruise, so find out when the slow times are (they run continuously throughout the day and night, depending on season). 3) Be sure to get a spot on the left side of the boat, especially if you take a night cruise. Most of the things that are described on the audio tour are on the left side, and if you are on the right side you might not be able to see what is being discussed. 4) You can move around the boat, so don't worry if you don't grab the seat you want right away, you can always change. 5) In my opinion, the daytime cruise was more enjoyable than the night time cruise.We took our tours with Bateaux Parisiens, directly across the street from the Eiffel Tower. No meal, just cruise with audio guide. It takes about an hour and it is fun if it's your first time in Paris. The only other thing I'd mention is that these tours are expressly designed for tourists, and so it is one of the few places where we felt herded through. Still, it's worth doing. Once."

I walked from Notredame area, to the effile tower area never with a problem. Since i was on a budget I would often grab a take-away lunch and just go sit by the river to eat. There is one bridge I don't know the name it's a pedestrian bridge and it's cover in love locks. These are all types of locks the couples write thier names on then attach them to the bridge amazing to see, my boyfriend and I made one last minute with a lock from a local store and a borrowed marker but some people get really into and come prepared with engraved customized locks. I recomend doing it if you're going in a couple it was just a sweet romantic touch to the trip."

            "review": "Inexpensive Dinner Cruise. On a whim my wife and I went on an inexpensive dinner cruise on the Seine river one evening while in Paris. We hadn't planned it, deciding to do it only as we passed by the departure point of a particular tour operator while walking along the river. This particular boat had leather chairs arranged in pairs with small round tables for each chair that pivoted out of the way. There are tables right near the window (where we sat) and another level above. The seating was a little cramped (not a lot of leg room) but acceptable. We had a choice of drink when we bought the tickets (at extra cost) - we chose wine, which came in individual 250ml (25cl) bottles (for 6\u20ac over the base 29\u20ac). There was also a choice of chicken or fish for the entree, served with rice. I chose the fish (salmon), which turned out to be quite good. My wife is a vegetarian and before we decided to take the dinner cruise we had been assured by a dock-side \"representative\" (salesman) that she would be accomodated. We were hoodwinked. Her \"vegetarian\" meal consisted of two helpings of rice instead of one. They had nothing else on the boat, not even vegetables. Thankfully, this particular dinner cruise was not expensive (relatively speaking). And it was otherwise a pleasant experience. However, because the banks of the Seine are so built-up, apart from the Eiffel Tower what you see from the boat is not nearly as impressive as what you see from a boat on the Thames in London, in my opinion."

Just make sure you do it in an area where there are not any street sellers and slightly away from all the other tourists, so you get a bit of space to yourself! We ended up walking from the eiffel Tower and east along the river, past Pont Alma and to Pont Alexandre III. A couple of days prior we had tried to walk west along the banks of the River from the Notre Dame. This was absolutely chaos, people bumping into you and being pushed off the pavement - it really wasn't enjoyable. The other thing to do is walk along the banks and keep crossing over the river on the bridges, that way you get some lovely views from either side. There are plenty of lovely walks to do....and the best thing is that they're free !!"

After reading online reviews, I selected Le capitaine fracasse as it had positive reviews and was moderately priced. Unfortunately the food was a huge disappointment and for 80 euros per person definitely not worth it. It was pre-made and kept in warmers, just like airline food. in fact our Air Tahiti meal on the flight over tasted better. We ordered the fish and steak plates. Both were flavorless, and overcooked. The service however was very good and of course the experience of dining on the river seine at night was magical. Our sincere recommendation is to take a river seine cruise, however save your money and do not book a meal cruise. Either have dinner before or after on land, and take a cocktail cruise or non meal cruise."

            "review": "Capitaine Fracasse dinner cruise on the Seine - very disappointing. We were really disappointed with this trip and did not feel it was anywhere near worth the money. Most of the food was indeed excellent. The starters and desserts were exceptional, but the main course let it down. We paid an extra 10 Euros each for the fillet beef which was extremely tough.One of the biggest disappointments, however, was the attitude of the staff. The whole event felt like a rushed, perfectly timed money-making escapade with little attention to customer service.Worst of all was that we felt we had been conned because the website was so inaccurate. We pre-booked windows in the front bay section at 10 Euros per person, and had an email confirmation of this, but when we arrived they seated us halfway back along the side of the boat and tried to charge us an additional 30 Euros. They have now launched a new version of the website, however, which is more representative of costs and seating arrangements but I would not be at all confident that you will actually get what you request. Another significant criticism is that the interior of the boat is lit so brightly that it's difficult to see out when it's dark because you just get the reflection of all the inside lights in the windows. They really do need to dim the interior. The best view is if you go up onto the outside top deck between courses. If the weather is nice it's absolutely spectacular.The 2 hour experience on board Capitaine Fracasse cost us 180 Euros (approx \u00a3150) and it certainly wasn't worth that. An evening trip down the Seine is a must - beautiful views, very romantic and relaxing, especially after dark, But my advice would be to eat in a nice little restaurant ashore first and then hop on one of the Bateaux Mouches where you get a 1 hour 15 minute cruise for just 10 Euros. You can sit up on the top deck and have the same spectacular views for a fraction of the price and a lot less hassle."

The only thing is that we weren't quite sure what all the attractions were because there is no narration as you cruise by the sights, but we figured it out by the end of our trip and also, it is kind of hard to find (Just take the bridge before the Eiffel Tower and walk to the middle of it, until you find the steps that go down to a small isle and it will come right to the deck at the precise time). Definitely worth the money and not a tourist trap at all. In fact, most of the people that were on the boat with us were locals."

My wife and I have walked all the bridges and quais of Paris, from the Pont d'Austerlitz in the East to Pont Mirabeau in the West. This is the true heart of Paris. We like to say we are Left Bank people, but you have to spend time on both sides of the Seine to appreciate this most wonderful of all cities. Here are some highlights. Quai des C\u00e9lestins is the Marais overlook on the Seine - views of the dome of the Pantheon from sidewalk cafes here. Quai de Montebello, one of my favorite spots in the world; in the shadows of Notre Dame along the left channel of the Seine. I've dined aboard the Kiosk Flotant (a floating cafe that plies the Seine in Paris) here on glorious sunny afternoons. Above is the Shakespeare and Company bookshop; and all along the quais, many bookstalls. Pont Neuf (\"new bridge\" - perhaps it was when it was built, but it is one of the oldest still standing, built in 1604) looks like a foritfication across the river, with its multiple turrets. It is the only bridge that crosses the \u00cele de la Cit\u00e9 without changing names.My favorite is the Pont des Arts, or Passerelle des Arts. It is a footbridge that crosses from the Institute of France to the Louvre. Upstream, it has a great view of Pont Neuf and Notre Dame beyond. Downstream, it is a wonderful spot for viewing the Eiffel Tower as it lights up at night.At the Port du Louvre, the walls between the river and the street along the Quai Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand give way to a view of the Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel between the Louvre and the Tuileries. Pont de la Concorde spans the Seine between the National Assembly and Place de la Concorde, with its Egyptian obelisk that marks the Eastern end of the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es. Quai d\u2019Orsay is special to me for the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay above it; the converted train terminal that now houses a great collection of Impressionist paintings.The most beautiful bridge in its own right is the Pont Alexandre III. It extends from the green expanse of Esplanade des Invalides on the Left to the exhibition palaces on the Right. Along with the Eiffel Tower, they were all built for the Exposition of 1900. Pont Alexandre III is lavishly decorated with art nouveau street lamps, cherubs and gold plated spirits of arts, sciences, industry and commerce atop tall columns.Next of note downstream is Pont de l'Alma; on the Right Bank end is Place de l\u2019Alma, where the gold plated flame centerpiece has been surrounded by flowers and memorials to Princess Diana since her fatal accident in the adjacent tunnel. This square is another place where people gather to watch the flickering lights of the Eiffel Tower light up each night.The Pont d\u2019Iena crosses between the Eiffel Tower and the Palais de Chaillot at the Trocadero Gardens. The Pont de Grenelle crosses Swan Aisle near where the model for the Statue of Liberty graces its downstream point. Then finally comes Pont Mirabeau. Apollinaire wrote:\u201cUnder Pont Mirabeau flows the Seine And our loves Must I remember themJoy always followed after painLet the night fall and the hours ringThe days go away, I remain\u201dAnd as for this writer, his heart will always remain in Paris, about which Gertrude Stein said, \u201cAmerica is my country, but Paris is my home town.\u201d"

It was busy, which my husband did not like and the company of our Saga friends and Americans, New Zealanders and Australians was excellent. My particular grouse was how can such a pretigious boat offer a doube room with two single beds pushed together? Also the food was great but not exciting. I think they catered for middle road and I could have done with more garlic and adventurous cooking. My husband loved it!

Our boat turned up 50 minutes late (good job the weather was warm) no apologies on the late arrival from the captain. The boat was more like a canal boat from the 70's with tired worn carpets and curtains, little space and bright interior lights. We sailed down the Sienne listening to YMCA and disco music. The food was definatley not worth the money and they try to just fill you up on lots of bread, on a positive you do get a bottle of wine which was nice and the waiter service was also very good.My partner and I thought the whole thing was hilarious (comedy sketch) sailing past the Bataeux Mouches boats which were wonderful and what we expected, I'm sure they were laughing at us trying to see past the bright interior lights.Anyway, I would definately do but book with the Bataux Mouches, enjoy."

They do a running commentary in both english and french and any other language-just have to ask. It lasts an hour. They have a nice place to pick up a sandwich or warm food plus drinks before getting onto the boat, much better than what you can buy round the Tower. The boat also has food available and a bar.A tip for UK visitors; you can get a coupon with your Tesco vouchers to exchange for a ticket at the booth.

Love the fact that you can stroll along the river any day and have picnics anytime, however I expected more from the boat cruise.For 10 Euros we took a boat cruise during the evening and although it was nice to see Paris at night I was disappointed that there was no tour guide to point out the various attractions. This is what I expected and we didn't get it. I spent 5 days in Paris and walked around at night, no need for me to sit on a boat to see the various attractions if I'm not getting any audio guide to tell me what I'm looking at. That's my opinion."

A lot of major Paris attractions sit on the river so there are plenty of things to see. Sit on the outside of the boat for the best picture opportunities or on the end inside if you don't want to be outside."

You get a large phone to listen to the commentry (in 8 different languages) of where the boat is taking you and tells you the history of all the monuments or places you pass by. We took it at night, and it was amazingly romantic."

            "review": "Batobus - River Taxi. Used the Batobus (river taxi/bus) to get around the city in April 2003. You can buy a single trip ticket, one day or two day pass. The two day pass is by far the best value for money which means you can hop on and off as often as you like. It is a great way to see the Seine and the left and right banks and delivers you to many of the top attractions. The stops are as follows: Notre Dame (Latin quarter), Jardin des Plantes, Hotel de Ville (City hall and Pompidou Centre), The Louvre (and Royal Palace), Champs Elysee (Pont Alexandre III), Eiffel Tower (Trocadero and Military school), Orsay Museum and finally onto St-Germain-des-pres.The service runs from April to October.10am - 7pm April, May and October.10am - 9pm June, July, August and September. Boats leave approximately every 20 - 25 minutes."
