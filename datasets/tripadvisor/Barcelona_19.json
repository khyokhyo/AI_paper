It is a grand tree-lined boulevard lined with a wide assortment of beautiful architecture, trendy high end shops as well as moderate-priced shops, and restaurants. It was a pleasure to stroll down, even if the Gaudi buildings had not been there."

On this street, there was a nice mixture of designer shops, baguette shops, bakeries, upscale hotels, and gracious architecture of multistoried buildings from the turn of the 20th Century. Tourists use this street to see two popular attractions - Gaudi's Casa Batllo and Casa Pedrera. These are easily accessed from 2 Metro stations on the street or from buses that criss cross the street. While the street has many take away baguette, pastry and croissant bakeries, it also has a stylish MacDonalds. We opted to eat breakfast there as it was across from Casa Batllo where we had a 9 am viewing of the house. Unlike Las Ramblas, there are fewer open-air patio cafes on this street. On Passeig de Gracia, the wide sidewalks are clean, busy but uncrowded, unlike Las Ramblas, and tree lined for shade. They are well lit in the evening as well so it feels safe while window shopping at the various stores with their sparkling clean windows. Although Passeig de Gracia is a busy dual-lane thoroughfare, pedestrians can safely cross the street using traffic controlled crosswalks. I preferred to stay in this area at the Doubletree Hilton hotel during my visit to Barcelona."

It's more pleasant for a stroll & like the La Rambla has a wide central pedestrian walkway in the middle with trees & seats put up for business by the restaurants & cafes on both sides. Shops here are largely more upmarket & there is quite a lot of international & designer Brand\u2019s. Most shops open late morning. It's particularly pleasant to stroll or shop at this strip early evening & go for dinner and drinks in the plentiful restaurants and bars in the vicinity after shopping."

In complete contrast to La Rambla, Passeig de Gracia is a calm, elegant road with every possible shop you can think of - Tiffany, Boss, Zara(!) - the spectrum is here. This is one road in Barcelona that you won't mind getting your wallet out in, and in contrast to La Rambla, you are less likely to have it nicked! Everything just seems better quality, even the coffee in the smallest coffee house tastes divine. On that note, try Divinus, which is at around 60 Passeig de Gracia and don't forget to visit the rooftop bar atop the Majestic Hotel at 68 Passeig de Gracia - with it's own outside dip pool, in good weather you'll enjoy the stunning views in a calm oasis. If it's raining it'll be closed. Beware the drinks are pretty pricey, but worth a visit 'just for one'."

From North to south these are my recommendations : Casa Mila (La Pedrera), Casa Battlo (from the outside), Casa Smattering ( right next door to Casa Battlo) and Casa Lleo I Morera.Restaurants in this street are super overpriced, so don't get tempted by the fladhy looking cocktails on the tables.

You can find here luxury brands as Chanel, Gucci, Miu Miu and Louis Vuitton, but also much more normally priced brands as Replay, Diesel, Zara, Brandy Melville, Max Mara, Massimo Dutti, Oysho, Puma, etc. There's also COS, one of my favorites. For those who prefer going through stores instead of shopping malls, this is your street. McDonalds is waiting for you across of Casas Battlo y Amatller, if you are in need of a fast food restaurant. But, most important fact is that at the end of this street (and by end I mean the part farthest from Placa Catalonya) you will see a sign on street for a Tourist office. The sign won't be red as ones you will see around the city (!), than blue. Those marked with red are hiding behind the counter most useless people I have ever see. Oh, and they're liars too and sell tickets for double price (they tell you different story). But, this one is in Palau Robert and a woman working here helped me find some place although she had to make a few phone calls to achieve it. Palau Robert has some great exhibition for your kids, btw."

You can find all the world known brands and discover less known but very good local ones. Provides for a very nice walk.

Very professional staff greeted us upon arrival, we had a premier room booked that was big and spacious on the 6th floor with a great bathroom and a view of the square behind the hotel but without a window to open which is important to us, so we fortunately upgraded at not much extra cost and hassle free for our remaining 6 nights, we then had a fabulous terrace room 803 on the 8th floor which I strongly recommend! A panoramic view of Barcelona and the street the hotel is on but no noise to hear at night! The room was cleaned to a high standard everyday! The bathroom is amazing but the only small criticism I have is that there is no main bathroom door, there is an inner toilet door that doesn't close tight and a shower door! Open plan is the style, see photos! But most wouldn't worry about this minor thing! The breakfast area is very pleasant with cooked food, cereals, fresh pastries and fruit, we opted to pay for this service upon arrival as cheaper than booking with your stay! Again the staff very pleasant and helpful and you can opt to eat outside in the garden area or inside the restaurant, we were very lucky to have good weather so sat outside everyday .The terrace rooftop bar can get very busy but a stunning view and well worth going to, the bar staff are very friendly and busy but will do their best to look after you! You can't book a table so its first come first serve! Cocktails are great and would recommend the burgers! Julia and a very tall young man (whose name I forget) are great! As are the rest of the reception staff who are always there for advice and help regarding your stay or where to go. The hotel is a good location for the city, for sight seeing, restaurants and shopping, runs parallel to Las Ramblas, also easy train ride to the fabulous beach! Would definitely recommend hiring bikes and doing the bus tour around Barcelona! We will hopefully return to Barcelona soon and stay at this hotel again!"

A walk down Passeig de Gracia will reward you with excellent people watching, excellent Gaudi sightings from street level, and interesting spots to eat and drink--as well as truly high-end shopping if that's your aim. For the tapas novice, Txapela, just after you begin your stroll from Placa Catalunya (on the right hand side) or farther along as you continue to stroll (also on the right hand side), is a good place to start. You'll be given a paper folder with pictures of 51 tapas (each about 2,00 euros) and listing the ingredients. For those who prefer to know what they are eating, this popular stop is an excellent place to begin. The atmosphere is lively and the people are friendly. As you proceed down the street, you'll see the Block of Discord on the left side of the avenue--you'll recognize it, never fear--and a few blocks farther on, you'll find La Pedrera, a UNESCO World Heritage site. The avenue has many cafes, most with sidewalk seating, at all price levels--including a MacDonalds.  It's quite simply a delightful avenue to explore."

It also has a particularly nice Zara Home. Also on Passeig de Gracia are two of Gaudi's masterpieces: Casa Batillo and Casa Mila. Both are worth viewing. If you do plan to visit, consider booking tickets in advance as there are often long lines outside Casa Batillo in particular.Also, take a moment to look at the pavement. The tile design is by Gaudi. It was apparently originally designed as an interior tile for Casa Batillo, but used in Casa Mila. The design was inverted (for wear) and laid as pavement in 1997. Another little touch that adds to the class of the place."

Paseo de Gracia , from the moment I stepped out of the Metro station with its Casa Batllo and its unique to Barcelona floor tiles and huge bike roads, makes for one of the best first city impressions I have ever had.Walking southwards one can get to the famous Plaza Catalunya after crossing huge roads with enormous impressive buildings and intersections with glowing fountains, straight from Utopia hahaha.It was an experience I will always cherish as the first impression of Barcelona and I believe you should too!

A couple of blocks higher is Casa Mila, or la Pedrera, another iconic Gaudi creation that may be toured. The street is also central to the Eixample neighborhood, an extension of Barcelona over a hundred years ago, and there are many beautiful residential buildings, and good shops and restaurants.

Good place to walk since there are a lot of restaurants, cafe. The hop-on hop-off bus stops at this location ( green/ orange line). If you're up for walking, you can walk from Passeig de Gracia to Las Ramblas.. Approx. 30 -40 mins depending how fast you walk. Make sure when you buy at the expensive stores to ask for the Tax Free form for VAT. It's a bit tedious getting your money back since you have to stay in line at the Guardia de Civil at the airport before you check-in then get your refund money. Just give yourself ample time like what I did."

It really is a long and lovely street to walk along. You can get to it via the metro which is a very good, cheap and regular service. We just love walking about places as you get to see so much more and, you can choose to stop whenever you want to browse, to admire things or just to watch the world go by.

Recommend to buy any tickets online to go and see the Gaudi attractions as the lines even in the low season often extend around the corner. Lots of expensive shops to look at (or indeed...spend in). However, it is the architecture that is the icing on this cake and not to be missed. For your cafe break I suggest you move off the main street and onto one of the side ones....to hopefully avoid exorbitant \"tourist\" prices. Have a cafe con leche, por favor (spanish) or the same thing in Catalan is cafe amb llet, si us plau . Photo ops are numerous. Really quite a magical place to wander."

We stayed at the fabulous Hotel Jazz by Universitat metro stop. We walked up (or was it down) on our way back from Parc Guell and bumped into lovely little fountains and statues along the way, and a very beautiful fountain at the crossroads with Gran Via Catalunya. We just kept stopping along the way and sat on the benches to really take in the beauty of the buildings and the little squares and fountains. By the way, on one of our evening return walks we bumped into the crossroads fountain and it was all lit up, changing hue constantly. We simply loved it!Of course, one cannot go through Psg. de Gracia without stopping at one of the numerous wonderful cafes. There is the lovely cafe at Casa Amatller, and countless others. I must say, the cakes, breads and croissants we had in Barcelona are superb...the best ever!!

Do not allow anyone in your company to carry a backpack in Barcelona.Be aware of any people behind you, and those who get on the scooter. The most common attack is when they roll scooter with motor off at a distance behind you so you are not aware that they are approaching and than very close to you turn o the motor, cut out or grab your backpack and yank it out off you draging and throwing the holder to the ground. Of course police in Barcelona is useless and even if oyu see them most likely they are not going to help you. If you go to the police station be prepared to be told to come back tomorrow because a person that speaks your language is not there at the moment. They will not allow you to fill a police report because it will look bad on Barcelona statistics."

I personally preferred a stroll down this street more than any other, and certainly more so than Las Ramblas, which runs parallel to it, but in the more southern part of the city. It is a big street, with some space for bicyclists, and not too crowded (like the tourist trap Las Ramblas). If you are into taking pics, this street is not to be missed."

The block between Carrer d'Arago and Carrer del Consell de Cent is called the Manzana de la Discordia where you have four buildings designed by Modernista architects including Gaudi.

While reminiscent of the Champs Elys\u00e9es, with its sidewalks lined with designer shops, fancy hotels, and upscale eateries, the exquisite fa\u00e7ades and ornate balconies of its beautiful buildings are fabulous examples of Catalan Modernisme at its most impressive -- especially the \"Manzana de la Discordia,\" the block between Consell de Cent and Arag\u00f3 streets, which boasts Gaud\u00ed's Batll\u00f3 House next to Puig i Cadafalch's Casa Amatller and Dom\u00e8nech i Montaner's Lle\u00f3 i Morera house on the corner, all vying for grandeur and well worth a visit. Gaud\u00ed's La Pedrera is only a couple of blocks away, on the other side of the street. It is worth going into some of the shops just to admire the beautifully designed interiors. Located in the heart of the Eixample district, a leisurely walk up and down Passeig de Gr\u00e0cia is mandatory, at least once."

I doubt that those with trouble walking or those who don't care for walking would enjoy the Passeig de Gracia but we felt it was a great time to just absorb the people watching and see all the many shops and things going on. You are never far from a cold beer or glass of wine and tapas."

You will also find Gaudi's Casa Batllo and Casa Milla (La Pedrera) on this street, which is one of the major North/South streets in the city. It is a very busy street, so be careful when crossing-careful of cars, but also careful of scooters and bikes. Some roads just look like sidewalks.

Given that this is not a national capital it is surprising that Barcelona has attracted so many top luxury brands to open up shops but here they all are - which is fine if you like to look around expensive shops and who doesn't? The only downside is that it pushes the rentals sky high so that even very ordinary cafes and restaurants have to charge exorbitant prices for very ordinary fare in order to make a profit. A very pleasant walk- especially if you are going to look at the Gaudi buildings anyway - but have a coffee before you hit the street and plan to have lunch in the much better restaurants - and better value - eateries elsewhere in the city."

I'm betting most people would - if not for that, for some of the finest examples of the modernista architecture, including Gaudi's Casa Batllo and farther up his La Pedrera (aka Casa Mila) actually on it, and for several others easily accessed by turning left or right and walking a block or two from it.The Passeig ends, as far as I can tell, at the Placa Catalunya, from where you can continue on the various Ramblas, also charming walkways, though it gets a bit frantic south of, and not quite as classy.

Tired walkers can stop for a coffee or a glass of wine at the many outdoor cafes. I was impressed with the lack of cars -- there were many buses and taxis (all ad-free) - and the assortment of scooters - a popular mode of transportation in this city where parking spaces are rare and expensive. Like Washington, DC, Barcelona in this section at least, has very low buildings giving walkers a nice sense of scale and a lot of beautiful sky to crown their ambles.Passeig de Gracia lacks the street scene of the nearby Ramblas that goes past the market and other attractions, but it well worth spending some time and clocking some miles along this impressive street."

The retail aspect is undermined by the unfortunate individuals who are begging: even had I been there to shop, there is no way I could spend money frivolously when people are in need. They are not in your face as one often finds in various countries in Asia. They sit, maintaining what is left of their dignity. Did I help them? Well, no, not much. I hope that this entry will prompt people to think about why they are here. For the architecture, fine. To shop, why? Maybe that helps the overall Catalan economy. That is good.

Walking straight down to Placa de Catalunya, La Rambla, the Catedral or harbour it's quite easy to navigate your way around."

On the way, we were treated to examples (Eixamples!!) of Gaudi architecture (like the Casa Batilo) and stately copy-cat buildings, including the ornate lamp posts. It was winter when we were here - bright and blue-skied, but cold, very cold. So it was great that when we dropped in for tapas, we could sit outside under the outdoor heaters and not be deprived of gazing at the beautiful street, full of teeming shoppers and tourists. Over the long weekend, this was where you could find us, grabbing a bite and drinking hot espresso coffee; admiring Gaudi's work and watching the world go by."

Zara has a gorgeous home store, and the clothing store is quite large. Across the street is a really interesting arcade of individual shops. Further up the shops become 'designer' but worth lookin at , from the street preferably. There are two Gaudi buildings on either side of the road. La Pedera is facinating especially from the roof. Sadly, it was thronged with students when we're were there, and they did not seem interested. It's a stiff walk to the top of the boulevard but there are gardens in the middle with seating. It becomes rather austere at the top with banks and other such official buildings. Retun to the bottom and prices become lower and places more accessable. Worth the stroll though."

The city decided to build this grand boulevard, which today has 4 of the mansions he was commissioned to design, as well as a host of fancy shops and hotels. It's the fanciest part of town.But look closely at the sidewalk. The design of the tiles is amazing, only Gaudi would think of something like that. Each tile is a hexagon, there's concentric circles in the middle linking up the design of the other tiles, you have to see it to understand. I can't image what a nightmare the tile layers would have had when they did this, and it's the entire length of the street on both sides! I was very fasciated by this information provided by Leon the guide from Sandeman's tour. Of you want to get your fill of the designer brands they're all here as well. But don't forget to visit La Pedrera and Casa Milla which are both World Heritae sights. Get tickets if you can, as I saw snaking Qs each time I went past."

There were also quite a number of cafes and restaurants along the street, but most unfortunately are for the tired, unsuspecting tourists with only quick bite-worthy food. Some have noted that Passeig de Gracia is one of the streets where pickpockets are particularly active. We did not have any such encounters, but probably because we weren't flaunting and asking to be robbed, unlike some tourists. I should warn you that your shopping experience might be marred by the rude, arrogant and loud tourists from China, who descend on these boutiques like they were your Gap or Costco. Be extra polite to the service staff, and they would treat you amazingly well - it is, of course, a world of difference compared to the other tourists (see above)."

There are two Gaudi buildings to tour, Casa Batllo and Casa Mila, and other famous architects are represented on the street as well such as Llu\u00eds Dom\u00e8nech i Montaner who designed the Palau de la M\u00fasica Catalana and Casa Lleo i Morera which is on the same block as Casa Batllo and is now open to tour. There are also many high end shops, restaurants, and many places to sit and people watch and/or rest. One of our best friends doesn't care for Barcelona, and I believe it is because she got a wrong impression of the city from the start by staying around the Gothic/Las Ramblas area. She always comments there is too much crime, while we have never experienced feeling that way at all and we've been to Barcelona twice more than she has. While Las Ramblas and the Gothic district are fun areas to explore, I wouldn't stay there- I do feel safer in Eixample along the Passeig de Gracia. It may be strange, but my husband and I both feel like we have returned home when we go to Barcelona and are sitting at an outdoor cafe along the Passeig de Gracia. In fact, after our first visit there, he said he could move to Barcelona."

You can even sit on the bench under the Gaudi-style lamp posts and watch life go by. The Passeig is filled with cafes and restaurants (most are tourist-traps but with delicious food/tapas) so be sure to grab a seat outside for a cafe con leche! All the designer shops including Gucci and Prada can be found in the Passeig, as well as Gaudi's houses (Casa Mila and Casa Batllo).

So dont be afraid and go in the see not only the view of Passeig de Gracia, but the wonderful chimneys designed by Gaudi.Dont forget to watch the beautiful floor, street laps and chairs that were also designed by Gaudi himself. Even the trees in Passeig de Gracia have a charm that will remained you how Gaudi was inspired by nature in his work. Specially the celling la Sagrada Familia, also a must see, but not in Passeig de Gracia. You can also find very good restaurants on the Passeig de Gracia or in the near by streets. Enjoy!!! "

Last time I was here in March 2014 I thought it was bad, but in July and August it got even worse. It is hard to cross to the other side. Another oddity is that the part after the Diagonal crossing has way too many kitchenware stores. Granted, each one is slightly different and is stuffed with clever and uniquely designed goods, but after a time one gets tired of kitchen towels and salt shakers.Two major underground stops are also on Passeig de Gracia, so it is also a good point of departure for those who, like myself, tend to easily get lost in the amazing maze of Barcelona."

The platforms are small and overcrowded and it is very hot and clammy in summer.

It is a marvel of the modern age that the Ajuntament (local government) has not added any artistic element, let alone a travelator to this seemingly interminable concrete highway."

Not only will you find two of Gaudi's most famous buildings (the Casa Batllo and La Pedrera), but you will also find his lesser known (and harder to pronounce) contemporaries like Llu\u00eds Dom\u00e8nech i Montaner and Josep Puig i Cadafalch. This trio can all be found nestled next to each other on what is called the Block of Discord, thus named for their reputation for going against the grain at the time. The easiest way to describe it's location is by saying it's across from the McDonald's, which unfortunately has tables with some of the best views of the three masters' buildings for a \u20ac5 table charge. If you want something a bit more local, go down the street on the same block as McDonalds to the other corner on Passeig de Gr\u00e0cia. There's a Spanish tapas chain with reasonable prices and a few tables with a view of Casa Batllo for those who want to drink in the facade with a tapa or two.Passeig de Gr\u00e0cia does not begin and end with the Block of Discord, further up is Gaudi's Casa Mila a.k.a. La Pedrera, which was under renovation as of June 2014. Between and beyond, there are countless other buildings that are beautiful and unique in their own right designed by architects that have been all but forgotten among their legendary neighbors. Take some time and soak in the modernisme style that contributed so much to Barcelona, her atmosphere and the Catalunian cultural identity."

The highlight of the walk is the Apple of Discord or Block of Discord that includes Gaudi's trippy masterpiece, Casa Batilo, which is prohibitively expensive to enter in my opinion but great to admire from the street for free"

La Pedrera and Casa Batllo, two of Gaudi's most interesting buildings, are found along here, although I was disappointed that La Pedrera was covered by screens and undergoing refurbishment when we walked past - I'm not sure how long this situation will last.Imaginarium is a very nice toy shop with a frozen yogurt snack bar. Not cheap though.I'd recommend having lunch in the top floor self-service restaurant of El Corte Ingles department store which is at \"La Rambla\" end of Passeig de G. The hot meal portions are large, so get one between two, and enjoy the panoramic views.We did Passeig de G and La Rambla one after the other, with lunch as described above to break up the roughly 1.2m total walk.It was fun."

I suppose you can access the train from some points in the subway station, but we ended up going down from the street into a section that put us directly at the train. The first couple of machines we tried to buy train tickets from would not accept cash. We ended up having to go back to street level and find another entrance to the train station and try other machines.We saw some confused and tired travelers arriving with their luggage and completely disoriented when they got to street level. If you are arriving into Barcelona at this station, make sure you have a street map/app with you.

There are no lines to in front of the cash register and the store manager does not care. They are immune to this and and are not worried about the safety of the customers but are more concerned about goods being shop-lifted. I reported the problem to Nike in the US but got lip-service. The hotel concierge called the Nike store but did not have much luck.My advise is not to carry cash or your ID on you. Use a credit card if you have to shop.The local cops do not care and some of the police stations are not staffed with cops who speak English.This continues to be a big problem in parts of Europe and does put a damper on tourism."

You can get into the foyer of this one even tho' it doesnt look open to the public, as its split into apartments, but just push the door and go in, the concierge didnt seem to mind. Passeig de Gracia is well placed for a metro connection, and about 10 mins walk to the start of Las Ramblas, where most of the 'street-life' starts in the early evening. Our hotel, Hotel Granvia, was very well placed on Passeig de Gracia and a great place to stay, see separate review."

Its legend \"Crazy Since 1941\" barely does justice to this fab shop full of products from high end and classy, through quirky to downright off the wall. All wrapped around a really unique and friendly atmosphere. Whether your interiors taste is Harvey Nics, Heals or Ikea you'll love a stroll around here. No pressure to buy from friendly and glamorous staff but you'll definitely be tempted. Don't miss going out into the open space which backs onto the Gaudi designed building next door. Happily I'd spend all day here. Open 10:00 to 14:00 and 16:30 to 20:30."

Why I say its a must to take a stroll here:1. You see so many state of art buildings on both sides of the street.2. Its like a walk in Paradise for Shopaholics. :) There are high street brands' outlets on this street.3. Casa Batllo and Casa Mila are this street. So, if you cannot fit in the trip to the mentioned houses don't be sad, just take a walk on Passeig de Gracia, you will not only be able to see both the 'UNESCO World Heritage' buildings but also so many other beautiful and stunning buildings, like the one adjacent to Casa Batllo.4. There are numerous and fantastic looking cafes on this street. They are little pricey though.5. Its so lively, I though it was so much better than Ramblas.One suggestion:1. Casa Batllo and Casa Mila are just 500m apart, so if you have reached one and are feeling too tired after all the walking, please don't chicken out, just walk a little more.2. If you have a provision of being dropped by cab/Tourist bus somewhere on the street, choose to be dropped either at Casa Batllo or at Casa Mila. That way you will need to walk a little less.3. We chose to go there late in the afternoon, around 1:30, we spent almost 5 hours in Casa Mila and Casa Batllo. We were completely exhausted, so headed for the beach to relax. You could do that too. There is a Metro station a few meters from Casa Mila, you could take Metro to the beach, you will need to change Metro once."

Dont get me wrong, there were plenty of tourists, but a much calmer atmosphere. Though many of the stores were the same as back home in USA (chanel, burberry, sephora), I still found many unique stores that I havent seen in the states. Found some nice things, decent quality (from what I can tell) at good prices. Morgan is a clothing store with cool stuff. Sales woman was very helpful and patient with my broken Spanish. Tascon for shoes. And I've never seen a Zara so big. Many of these shops are on perpendicular blocks to P de Gracia, or on P Catalunya. Was a nice walk in neighborhood afterwards for dinner. Very safe at night (or so it appeared to me)."

However, we found we had to pass through a long underground pavement and it seemed under constructions. We felt hot and bit frustrated as we had carried big luggage. Thus, we looked for the other way at our return journey and found we went to Barcelona Sants was much convenience, especially when we carried a lot of things back. Although few more stop of metro, but the transit and up and down the metro saved us a lot of time and energy, you could also take Barcelona Sants rather than Passeig de Gracia as we did not know how long the constructions would be finished and you can get rid of the long underground pavement."

Many places also have outside tables, to watch the world go by. Unluckily we caught a grey, cold and rainy day.Besides that, there's also a lot nice architecture to look at, like Casa Amatller and Casa Batll\u00f3. It's a good stroll to do and something for everybody. Of course we would have enjoyed it even more on a sunny day.Wanna know more about my trips?

But be warned though, not all the salespersons in the shops are friendly nor helpful towards Asians. Strange that they do not see the need to establish good public relations although they're in the retail business. Expect that the most polite request in English can result in a hostile and less than friendly response from them. Having said that, there were service staff who were especially helpful and nice. One such example was this sales lady in the Bimba y Lola shop situated along Carrer de Valencia. She was a refreshing exception. Wish there were more of such nice humble people around."

I had chosen 'Passeig de Gracia' as the hub where to switch from the Renfe train to the metro because it seemed to be the most convenient. Since the PdG station is undergoing some major construction (from May 12 for ca. 16 months), it was hard to switch having to leave the station, looking for the metro, going downstairs again; all with luggage. (Returning to the airport this morning, we avoided PdG and chose Clot instead. No sweat!)Also, beware of pick pockets at the PdG metro stop since it is a major hub. The metro was pretty crowded, I tried to make my way in, suitcase and all. I had my purse around my neck and shoulders. Some woman tried to block my way. She had a coat over her arm. I then noticed her touching me. Under that coat she was trying to open my purse. I slapped her on her hands and she left the metro. I was even more careful after that. Left everything at the hotel; took passport copies with us and only one credit card and a little money."

Brilliant street running down from Diagonal Metro to Passeig de Gracia Metro.You can reach here by metro L3 or L5 at Station Diagonal or by metro L3 at Station Passeig de Gracia.This is one stop for everyone, from food to cloths, architectures to hotels everything is available. Best plan would be to have a cheap and best hotel Casa Gracia booked which is on the street itself with easy access to the street and its holdings.When you stroll from Diagonal metro towards Passeig de Gracia Metro, you will find brilliant Gaudis architectures in between turned into museums and restaurants like Casa Mila. Big brand shops like Louis Vuitton, Escada, Hugo Boss, Bimba n Lola and Gucci are also on this street. Hugo Boss has an amazing visual appeal from outside.For local food you can try Tapa Tapa restaurant. There are other american coffee and food outlets as well on the street in case you dont want to try local food.This is a must visit and you will never get bored during your stroll or stay. Its advisable to book a hotel on this street to enjoy it the most. Also from 2 metro stations on this street you will find easy access to other attraction of Barcelona. For Ex: for Park Guell take L3 from Diagonal towards Trinitat Nova.Or for Sagrada Familia take L5 from Diagonal towards Vall d'HebronOr for Barceloneta beach take L4 from Passeig de Gracia towards La Pau."

It's a very nice street it's clean it's safe and has a lot of shopping. However if you're visiting from the United States I wouldn't go spend your money on one of the expensive stores on the street. A lot of the products are available back home and you can probably get them for much cheaper without paying the high prices that you see in Europe. The street also has one of the Gaudi houses. And the street also leads into Plaza Catalunya. It's a central place to stay in Barcelona"

To better understand the architecture of this period, you can visit the \"Centre for Modernism\" in P. de Gracia 41. This is also the street of fashion with all the major Italian and international brands having luxury boutiques here!"

The difference here in Barcelona is that the sidewalks are filled with dirty kids hanging out all over the place. Compared to Madrid, Barcelona is a huge letdown. While Madrid is cosmopolitan, Barcelona is honkytonk in my opinion. Madrid is clean and beautiful and quiet, while Barcelona is dirty, loud and cheap looking (not cheap in reality though)."

The shopping is there, to be sure, as are a number of excellent restaurants and highly rated hotels. Nestled within them are \"la manzana de la discordia\", the masterpieces of Catalan modernist residential architecture from Gaudi, Puig, & Domenech i Montaner that must not be missed even if (like us) the shopping isn't an attraction. Finally, this is a great place for strolling and people watching off of Las Ramblas and Barri Gotic. We ventured down Passeig de Gracia early in the evening on a weekday, and many of the locals were out in the common areas taking a short walk, hitting the tapas bars for some wine and a quick bite, and enjoying some time with their children. For that and the architecture it was worth a solid rating for us--it is a can't miss if high fashion or fine dining from Barcelona will be part of your trip."

Note the nice public lighting, and the Gaudi works along this grand avenue. Perfect for ambling, window shopping, people-watching, and enjoying a leisurely easy going time, taking in a bit of Barceona's care-free atmosphere."

Between a couple of Gaudi buildings (check these out - magnificent) and the more modern buildings, there is a multitude of beautifully designed, exquisitely finished shops. The wonderfully broad promenade is peppered with unique restaurants and food outlets, each providing an interesting take on the cuisine of the city and region. Equally the street can play host to a special occasion dinner or simply a pick-me-up breakfast after a night of partying, watching from the promenade as Barcelona goes about it's business. Also, the transport connections from here can get you anywhere in the city on the Underground, so it is an excellent jumping off point."

Not really my cup of tea but I can understand how it draws people in every day and all year round.Typically a very touristy street leading to the barrio of gracia hence the name passeig de Gracia (Passage to Gracia).It's a beautifully constructed street with elegant lamp posts and a lovely fountain at the meeting point of another major road Gran Via.This street is where all the designer boutiques can be found such as Burberry, Tiffany's and Chanel to name a few. It also contains all the other well know retail stores such as Mango, H&M and Zara. It caters for all budgets but slightly more so for those that fancy spending a little more.There are also a nice range of book shops, bars, coffee shops and bars along this street as well as a Mcdonalds (quite a posh one at that).Worth a stroll along just for the atmosphere if nothing else. This is a very busy street and you will get caught up in crowds the closer you head toward Placa Catalunya. As always in Barcelona, keep an eye on your valuables."

It's a short walk from La Rambla & what a wonderful street - you'll find plenty of designer shops & some of Gaudi's finest works can be found here, including Casa Batllo & La Pedera. Vincon, next to La Pedera is the place if you've ever hankered after Philippe Starck fitted wardrobes - it's also the last word on every other home idea, from lamps to toys. Elsewhere along this stretch of street you'll find fabulous (& fabulously expensive) furniture & antique shops specialising in Art Deco & Art Nouveau. Loved the place!"

What was intended as the major (and only) road that would link the old city of Barcelona with the countryside, over the years and much clever real state business schemes, became what you see today; the most luxurious, expensive, flashy boulevard in Barcelona. And way too crowded. Lines, long lines are the norm everytime tourists try to go to say, La Pedrera or Casa Batll\u00f3 (both, Gaudi masterpieces). Hords of tourists cram the few tables available outside on the sidewalk some lucky restaurants have. And be prepared to pay three or more euros for a lousy cup of espresso. My advise, go early. Walk the boulevard when no one else does; on a Sunday mornig (but really early). The light is perfect for pictures!"

It is lined by many shops and a few signature sites of Barcelona, such as Casa Batlo and La Pedrera.To access this road, just take the L3 metro and get off at the \"Diagonal\" station. When you surface to the ground, you will be on \"Av. Diagonal\" and \"Passieg de Gracia\". This is a good starting point. Just walk southwards down \"Passieg de Gracia\". The beginning of \"Passeig de Gracia\" is a bit quieter with more high end shops, but as you go southwards, the pace picks up, and you will notice a lot more tourists, restaurants and regular stores. As mentioned before, you will see a few of Gaudi's famous architectural masterpieces on \"Passeig de Gracia\". If you are walking southward, you will notice \"La Pedrara\" on the left, and a bit further down you will notice \"Casa Batlo\" on the right. The road itself is about 6-7 blocks. The good thing is, that if you continue on this road, it will lead you right to the Gothic area of the city, which is completely unique on its own.Enjoy some of our shots."

Two of the important Gaud\u00ed's buildings can be found on this important avenue, Casa Batll\u00f3 and Casa Mil\u00e0 (la Pedrera). Also, right next to Casa Batll\u00f3 is Casa Amatller designed by Josep Puig i Cadafalch for chocolatier Antoni Amatller. This is a very famous and important avenue since lots of beautiful well maintained modernist buildings are found here. Of course, there are plenty of others through out the city but they are concentrated here.Lots of expensive famous designer shops with their fancy window displays and Boulevard Rosa shopping center, lots of restaurant and tapas but most of them cater to tourist so I wouldn't recommend them but if you just want to rest in one of the coffee shops to drink something and have a piece of pastries, it is totally fine to do so. Be careful with your purses or belongings even when you think you are in a safe area.Passeig de Gr\u00e0cia runs parallel to la Rambla de Catalunya so you can kill two birds with one stone."

It is always busy with locals going about there daily lives. The buildings are an interesting mix of the old and new. Two of Gaudi\u2019s best buildings are here. The fantasy castle like Casa Batllo with it\u2019s brightly colour glass tiled exterior and its eccentric inferiors. Further up the street is Gaudi\u2019s apartment block the Casa Mila with its iconic white tiled chimneys. Both are well worth a visit, but get there early as the lines of tourists build up quickly. There is a lot of traffic in several lanes, but there are plenty of pelican crossings and the pedestrian ares are large enough for you the forget the traffic is there. The street lights are beautiful, so make sure you look up. This is a great place to spend on morning shopping and sightseeing and there are lots of places on the main road to get a coffee or Tapas. If you want a restaurant investigate the side streets, they are packed with shops, cafes and delightful restaurants. Not the cheapest parts of town but definite must for any trip to Barcelona."

Passeig de Gr\u00e0cia is a thoroughfare rather than a destination in its own right, but a tour of Barcelona without coming here would be deficient. This is the trendiest major shopping street of Barcelona, and a strip of good bars and restaurants, as well as a natural walking route linking interesting architectural sights such as Gaud\u00ed's La Pedrera and Casa Batll\u00f3. Many top fashion and luxury brand boutiques are located in the 10 city blocks of Passeig de Gr\u00e0cia between Avenida Diagonal in the north and Plaza Catalu\u00f1a in the south. Be vigilant against pickpockets and bag snatchers."

As you head further up the hill you'll also notice a few of the buildings built by Gaudi - in my opinion more beautiful than the sagrada de familia - and just as interestingly designed.

There are two Gaudi masterpieces here, namely Casa Mila and Casa Batllo. Most of the buildings are very elegant and are well maintained. There are very many international designer stores, showing that many Barcelona people have plenty of money. Even if one cannot afford anything from these stores, it is still entertaining to see their show windows and what goods they offer. There are very many jewelry stores also, with a display of gems that only the rich can afford. However there is a place called El Bulevard Rosa at Passeig de Gracia, 53, which is like a small shopping mall with small stores, but stores that are very affordable. Most of them are clothing and shoe stores, and many stores for baby clothes too. What I enjoy about this street is that the sidewalks are very wide, so even if there are hundreds of people walking on the street, one does not feel cramped because there is very much space. The thing I enjoy most is looking up the buildings and see the decorations on their facades. Very original. It is too bad that modern architects cannot learn anything from these elegant buildings. Modern architects are in love with minimalism, which does not go well with me. A little decoration on the fa\u00e7ade of buildings will make streets more beautiful. Anyway, this is my favorite street in Barcelona."
