Experienced before, that in Russia you have to buy tickets on advance or you have to wait for a long time. Did not have option for Grand palace. We took boat, very nice trip, but only if good weather. avoid wind and waves. Arrived in fantastic place, no wonder why Tsar have chosen this place. Pity, there was many people like me, means to crowded. Wanted to see place inside, there was very, very long queue. believe it or not, after 1,5 hour standing, suddenly tickets office closed. I never found out why, in the middle of a day. About 1pm. Maybe staff went for lunch and they do not have enough employee??? More then 150 was still waiting. This is probably only possible in Russia, even difficult to understand. believe Russians are experienced to queue up......."

Thence there are 2 main reasons to see it: First - to get the general impression and feeling of the Russian Emperors' official Palace residence, including all its beauty and unparallelled richness; and Second - to get the pleasure of seeing art objects at your choice. My definite advice is that you pre-plan what you would like to see there, in advance. Otherwise you are at a risk of having your brains overloaded. For individual visitors: get the entrance ticket (open date) online and skip the huge que."

It is a park complex with lots of fountains that you can explore! You must go inside the Peterhof Grand palace. It gives you the feel of old times! Overall a great place to visit on a dry day in St-Petersburg."

This palace is the most grand I have seen....but nothing less for Peter the Great...the palace had a lot of add on buildings over time. The gardens are the most breathtaking...and I saw more gold than in a jewelry store! Lots of walking, but so much to see....try to schedule the hydrofoil ride to or from the Palace. It is a real treat! There are also some food concessions out near the docks. I would highly recommend a guided tour as you will hear all about the details and history of this Grand Palace."

Peterhof is a forty minute drive from the centre of St Petersburg.This has been called the \"Russian Versaille\" \u2013 the palace that Peter The Great built. The building was built by 1721.You need to wear plastic protectors for your shoes so that the floor is not affected. You are not allowed to take any photos or videos. There are ladies in each room who ensure that nobody breaches this rule. They also regulate the number of visitors in each room. You barely have time to listen to what the guide says before you are ushered on to the next room.The staircase leading up to the upper floor is very ornate and \u201cdripping with gold\u201d. I was awe struck by the Ball room and the Throne room in particular. Other rooms were magnificent too. They are all lavishly decorated. At times I felt they were over the top with some of the decorations. Opening times are from 10.30am to 7pm. On Thursdays the closing time is 9pm. Admission prices are 550 Rubles (equivalent to about GBP7 Aug 2016).I would recommend visiting this Palace. It should be among the top three places to visit in St Petersburg."

Must buy a ticket to palace park at Rub 700.00 each, then line up for tickets to Grand Palace at Rub 600.00 each. You are in a totally different world. The lavishly decorated with gold leaf and mirrored walls with oak paneled floors, beautiful chandeliers and grand rooms for various occasions give you an insight to the glory days of Great Tsars. All the trouble to go up their and buy tickets disappear once you are inside. The master plan to create this masterpiece with rows of fountains overlooking the gulf of Finland is only summarized with one word as MIRACLES performed by Peter the Great."

As someone who grew up during the cccp period in western europe, it seems unbelievable to see the riches of Peterhof, stroll through the beautiful gardens, and admire the water fountains.

The palace was originally laid out by Peter the Great. Photos are not permitted within the palace. The opulence rivals the Hermitage. Overshoes are worn to protect the oh so intricate patterns. The palace was re-constructed after WW2, following destruction by the Nazis. The workmanship is so good, that it appears to have been finished only yesterday. We visited in Autumn, without crowds. It is likely a mad house in summer, as the visiting process is linear, and one can be held up by gawking large groups. A guide is essential, if you really want to learn something about Russian culture and history."

We saw completely different sides of St Petersburg on the way including noticing the old docks and the extensive civil engineering work that is being undertaken. The ride was a thrill. It is windy on the dock on arrival but we had the sun at our backs. The walk along the canal to the fountains is simply wonderful. The fountains are a marvel. The Palace itself is small compared to Versailles and the Winter Palace but the richness of the display is almost dazzling! If you go to St Petersburg is would be a huge shame to miss this Palace and its fountains and gardens!"

The Tsar wanted a 'Russian Versailles' and I have to say (having been to Versailles) he outdid the French when comes to the gardens. Much grander than Catherine Palace, it is the most carefully designed and perfectly manicured gardens you'll ever see. If you arrive by coach and take the hovercraft back to Saint Petersburg, allow a good 10-15 mins to make your way down to the jetty by foot."

It's evident the tour companies are given priority with early access before the Palace is officially opened to the public. But there are still vast numbers of people visiting here just like the Hermitage and Catherine's Palace so it makes these visits all a bit of an ordeal even when you do get in early. Apart from the obvious extravagance on display which is on a truly grand scale and which is truly amazing, what is even more astonishing is finding out what you've looking at is the painstaking reconstruction after the near total destruction of these beautiful palaces by the nazis by a lot of very talented and dedicated people. Well worth the visit despite the numbers who you'll have to share it all with."

But in the end we decided to pay for the tickets to go round the building while we were there and what a good decision that was. Having been to the Winter Palace we weren't really expecting to be impressed; but Peterhof surpasses the Winter Palace in gold ornate decoration; the ball room is just wonderful...what a life those people lived (although you can see how the mood for a revolution grew). We went there by hydrofoil from St Petersburg and that was such an easy and pleasant way to get there...but we aware these are sometimes cancelled due to weather. One tip, if you don't want the fast food options dotted around the gardens, there is a charming little cafe/restaurant down some steps hidden away on the eastern side of the grounds."

Out front are fabulous extensive formal gardens, better than, but in the style of formal European gardens. This was originally vegetable beds and fish ponds in 1725. In the rear is an extensive private park with incredible tiered step fountains down to the sea channel. In 1730 the Samson Fountain was installed depicting Samson defeating a lion. This represents Russia's victory over Sweden in the Great Northern War...There are dozens of fountains on the grounds including several trick fountains that are designed to soak unwary guests. Of particular interest is the fact that all fountains are gravity fed from an elevated lake on a nearby mountain without any pumps. The palace was occupied by the Nazi's in the second world war and the palace treasures, the palace building and most of the fountains were largely destroyed. Restoration began in 1947 and some of the treasures that had been hidden were returned and restoration continues today. On our interior tour about half the building has been restored to its original glory and similar art and furniture has been brought in to replace that which was lost and to supplement that which was saved. This is a truly memorable palace to visit and although a little expensive, you should be comfortable knowing all the money today goes toward upkeep and continuing restoration."

This gigantic and beautiful palace was pretty far from the city center and there were only 2 ways to go there, by expensive hydrofoil (boat) and bus. It took about 40 mins by hydrofoil, cost about 1400p roundtrip) from the pier behind the Hermitage to the pier at Peterhof. And it'd take more than one hour and a half from the city center to the upper garden of the Peterhof. So I took the hydrofoil as well as so many of tourist. Anyway, if you've full day for this place, I recommend you to take the bus to Peterhof and take the hydrofoil back so it's cheaper and you can enjoy both upper and lower gardens. Here's why; I had to buy the ticket for entering the palace and lower garden at the gate near the hydrofoil pier, and if I got out of the palace to the upper garden, I couldn't use the same ticket to came back to the lower garden even though I had the hydrofoil ticket back to town. That's kinda nonsense for me. :-( So if you wanna enjoy both lower and upper garden (which may not be so different), you'd better enter the Palace from the upper side which is impossible if you go there by hydrofoil. Anyway, I spent about 3.5 hours only in the lower garden and then time's up! I didn't even get inside the Palace so I can't tell anyone about it. But the garden was great a big enough to took you whole day. There are one or two little palaces beside the main building that I had to pay more if I'd like to have a look inside. So the 400p ticket I paid for getting into the Peterhof didn't include the entrance of other palaces inside. That's why it's the most expensive places for me in Russia. Anyway, the summer fountain and the garden were nice and beautiful. :-) I'd recommend whoever have more than 2500p to spare to go there.

I was a solo visitor, and I didn't rent the audio guide...which was a big mistake.Because I didn't have the audio guide, I could only read the brief description set in each room, and I wanted to spend time appreciate those rooms. But there were many Chinese groups, and sometimes the staff thought I'm one off them, and pushed me to stay with them (since they need to do volume control), but those Chinese groups knew I'm not one of them and asked me to stay away from them. Sometimes I only wanted to read the description carefully, but I was forced to move alone since I was standing at the spot where the Chinese group wanted to stay and they didn't want me to hear their introduction for free.God....I had no intention to eavesdrop their introduction, but I had nowhere to go, since I was stuck among 3~4 Chinese groups at once.Really awful experience....and in the end I had no impression what I saw in that palace, except tons of Chinese people.Maybe the Grand Palace can have better idea to ensure both group and individual visitors have nice visiting experience."

I have been here before and the first time I went, the fountains were breathtaking.This time we went, there was some event going on. Most of the fountains were shut off because they put a stage on it. The \"show\" was a bit bizarre and the music loud. The event clearly did not fit in the Peterhof setting. We came by Peterhof Express (hydrofoil). The express lands you in the \"lower fountains\". You cannot go around to the front. I am not sure who designed the entrances, but clearly designed to rake in as much money as possible. It costs 700 rubles to enter the \"Lower fountains\". The upper gardens is free. There is supposed to be a beautiful fountain in the upper garden. However, once you enter the Lower fountains, you have no in/out access. This means if you want to see the upper garden, you have to pay another 700 rubles to re-enter. Found that quite annoying. Access to the palace is 600 rubles. You are NOT allowed to take photos and they make you put on little booties.I don't understand why you cannot take photos, because both the Hermitage and Catherine's palace allows it. Again, it is probably to increase revenue. My recommendation is to take a bus so that you can access the upper gardens first before entering the Lower fountains and palace. The trip would take longer, but well worth it. I would also recommend joining a tour. We went on our own. No one speaks English and we spent a good 20 minutes confused about where to enter and where on the grounds we actually were. Having a guide also helps with the explanations of each of the roomsStill is definitely a place to visit at least once in a lifetime."

Look for the Great Cascade, the Roman Fountain, The Dragon Fountain, the Lion Fountain, the Adam and Eve Fountains spaced apart for symmetry,and the Spring Fountain designed to look like the petals of a flower. Please also be aware that the Fountains are turned off in September. The Palace is the only one to not allow photographe inside and do expect large queues in high season of up to an hour.

Wilson private tourguide which was well worth it.If you don't fancy history, this place is still incredibly and visually stunning. Truly lovely to look at, parks, palace and interior of Peterhof. However, you are not permitted to take photos inside so they can make more money by selling photobooks in the gift shop. Which is disappointing if, like me, you love photography. (Outside in the park you can take photos and it's lovely and beautiful. But even on a nice sunny day it can be windy, so beware.)If you do fancy history, a tourguide is probably a good idea. We got a lot of background to Peter the Great, his daughter Elizabeth and Catharine the Great out of Sergej and lots of little jokes and stories and myths about the palace and everything inside and around it. I really loved this experience!"

It's about 50 mins from SP centre - and you pass some interesting places on the way.The palace is a wow when you see it and the amount of gold it has . When you go- don't take a big bag . There are restrictions. You have to wear covers on your shoes, all costs have to be handed in to cloakroom as with any bulky bags. You are not allowed to take any pictures or video inside the palace. Hide any water bottles or these will be taken from you. It s well worth the visit as guide gives you a great insight into what all the Rooms were used for.On a lighter note - I had to giggle when I saw the extravagant chandeliers as the only fools and horses sketch came to mind!!'From the palace you walk through the gardens.?Unfortunately between sept and may you won't see the fountains on as its end of seasonThere are various outbuildings I would have liked to have looked round but being on a tour did not get opportunity to do this. You also when booking he an option to return by hydrofoil - may be quicker than return by coach so worth thinking about. Out of season - take a cardigan or coat as your near the sea and is very windy. There are loads of statue fountains to see such as \" Adam and Eve\" and a surprise one where you go to walk round and you get a soaking.( they do warn you 1st) Toilets are limited - either go before or after the palace tour which takes about an hour. I am glad I went for the experience and the historical value. There is a souvenir shop on site.warning: outside in the gardens , especially in the more sought after photo places, pick pockets are rife . "

This place makes Buckingham Palace look like a small country house!The incredible interiors are well worth visiting, even if it is very busy and you get hustled from one room to the next quicker than you would like.The fountains are all gravity fed and are unbelievable with their amazing decoration.Don't miss this and be prepared to spend a day here. If you are spending a few days in St Petersburg, I'd suggest going on a sunny day to get the full impact of the gardens."

Peterhof Grand Palace is a huge complex of stunning palaces and gardens in the suburb of St. Petersburg 50 km west of St. Petersburg accessible by hydrofoil speed boat, train and bus. It used to be the summer palace of Peter the Great, a Russian Tsar and Emperor (1672 - 1725) known for his massive reforms. Changes continued throughout the 18th - 19th centuries by the following emperors including major restorations done after the second world war which caused massive damages.We can easily spend the whole day in this \"Russian Versailles\" exploring the different buildings, gardens and admiring its 147 shiny fountains supplied by natural springs, a technology state of the art. Claim the best spot if you want to see the turning on of the fountains at 11 am (summer only; shut off during winter).Be prepared for a long walk, put on comfortable shoes and protective clothing against the summer sun. Since it's such a popular place, arriving early is advisable (and still expect long lines). Pack you lunch and have a picnic here or eat at Shtandard restaurant in the park with reasonably priced food (separate reviews).Taking the hydrofoil (meteor speedboat) was not only fast (30 minutes) but an experience in itself. You can buy tickets and board at the pier in front of Admiralty building (Admiralteyskaya) or the jetty of Hermitage museum which are close to each other. The boats leave every half an hour. Combined tickets were available (boat + entry to palace/garden) to minimize queuing in Peterhof.Lastly, if you go on your own (no guide), read the history and background stories of the different buildings and have a map so you can appreciate things better and make the best use of your time. Please note that all buildings are open and all fountains work only during summer, May to October (visited in June a few years back)."

Equally impressive are the hand laid wooden floors, each room a different pattern.

            "review": "Crowded, But For Very Good Reason. It's pretty telling that what is really one attraction has been divided into three (the palace, fountains, and grounds) on this site, and yet they are #1, 2, and 3 in the rankings. This palace is not as well known in the west, but it's one of the very best in all of Europe and likely the world.Peter the Great, who built Peterhof, visited Versailles before becoming tsar and was so taken that he hired the same architect and largely asked him to improve upon the original. He was helped in that endeavor by the fact that St. Petersburg was basically built on a swamp and there are ample springs and rivers to supply the many, many fountains, a luxury Versailles did not and does not have.Peterhof is not as well known outside Russia as should be in part because was in the Soviet Union, but also because the Nazis dynamited the central structure during their retreat from Leningrad. It has, however, been wonderfully restored to its original brilliance.Peterhof is magnificent. The exterior is gorgeous. In the interior you go from one impossibly ornate room gleaming with gold to another. Every detail is beautiful, from the floors, to walls and ceilings, to furniture, to decorative items. The nearest rival is the Versailles, but both are almost overwhelming in their grandeur.One note: They don't allow photography inside the palace (outside is fine) and they'll ask you to leave your backpacks in a locker.As you exit the palace, you come upon the extensive fountains. These likely have no equal anywhere. The water cascades down steps lined with gilded statues of mythological figures into a large pond down to the Gulf of Finland.From there you go to the extensive gardens, themselves filled with fine views, a variety of fountains, and various decorative structures. One fun area has fountains that were once secretly manned to turn on to surprise visitors. These now are filled with excited children and even the adults had fun as well.This attraction has few peers.The downside of all this is that it is a major attraction for tourists and locals and can get very crowded. We really don't like the crowds but, truthfully, this is one attraction that is likely worth the occasional wait and having to put up with them. In any case, as you leave the palace the gardens are so large that they are very much dissipated.Our recommendation: Come here, recognizing that you won't be alone. Make sure it's a nice day, though, so you can get the most out of your enjoyment of the fountains and grounds."

We were allocated a time slot and after a pleasant drive to the grand Palace arrived mid morning. It was a freezing cold day and raining so queuing to get into the building was not enjoyable. All those queuing behind also wanted to be inside, so there was a lot of pushing and shoving the closer we got to the entrance. Wearing rain gear we were told it would have to be taken to the cloakrooms where it was also very crowded. We had an enjoyable tour around the palace but because of the crowds, we were constantly being told to move along before our guide had time to tell us about the particular room we were viewing (This happened at every venue we visited so became the norm). After our allotted time inside we were taken out into the gardens which are quite something with all the statues in the fountain/waterfall being gold. We had a little time to wait as the fountain is only switched on late morning, We walked around the extensive gardens and saw many unique and very unusual/interesting water follies. There is a train available to take you around if walking is a difficulty. We walked down to the shoreline with the norweigan sea, and could view St Petersburg across the bay. When the time came for the fountain to be switched on, the world and his wife were there taking advantage of any photo opportunity. It was a very interesting place to visit but what spoiled it for me were the crowds of people and the freezing cold weather. It was Russia Day so there were a lot of individual Russian families taking the opportunity to visit and possibly the passengers from the other 6 cruise ships docked that day. Maybe on a warmer day I would have enjoyed it more. It is definitely a must place to visit."

Trip is about 45 mins, only a few mins more than the hydrofoil, but you enter at the top of the grounds and get to enjoy the upper gardens and fountains (free) before approaching the palace and buying ticket to Lower Gardens if you wish to catch the \"Grand Cascade\" fountain startup at 11 (when we visited this simply amounted to turning on the fountains to a short piece of music -don't know if that is what the grand cascade normally amounts to but don't feel desperate to get there by 11 am for that if it is and if you are coming in high season, as everyone rushes to the palace thereafter). We bought our palace tickets around 1030 am when there was no lineup - they can be used at any time during the day. There was no \"1030 to noon\" or \"230 to 4\" time restrictions for individual tourists as I have read elsewhere on tripadvisor, the tickets were usable all day. We then spent the afternoon in the lower gardens - there are multiple satellite museums that can be visited. The trick fountains are a joy to watch. Easy to imagine Tsar Peter offering his guests a seat in a gazebo or on a bench only to see their finery drenched. Today kids giggle prancing thru them. MY ONLY BLACK MARK AND WHY THIS IS 4 STAR VS. 5 RATING -- GET RID OF THE BIRD INCARCERATION!! Its so 19th century. The tragic screeching and squawking of our feathered friends doomed to grip tiny bars in barren one foot square cages in the \"aviaries\", as they stare out at the sky that they should be flying across, is sickening. Zoos are over, guys. If you must insist on having tourists see a couple parrots in a cage, kill and stuff two or three of them and that's good enough -- don't doom live birds to a lifetime of torture! Tourists, please don't buy an aviary ticket. There are more than enough other highlights of this Palace to see anyway. We enjoyed the \"Special Treasury\" (crown jewels/other objets), for example - small but impressive exhibit."

The tour through is well directed but will be busy and you will be required to wear some paper overshoes in an unattractive shade of brown!! If you have a larger bag or coat you will be required to check this in and this can be quite a busy and chaotic experience as when retrieving you will be in the mix with those checking stuff in. Having negotiated the Palace we then moved through to the gardens and waited on the terrace for the fountains to commence their display which starts at 11am and is accompanied with music. The gardens themselves are extensive and a great area to walk around and to also escape the crowds of the palace and fountain areas and were modelled on Versailles. Stunning place to visit and enjoy some splendour."

We were totally immersed ourselves in this spectacular view: elegant halls, exquisite collections (most in gold), grandiose display, gigantic building\u2026 not paying attention to what happened outside the Palace.Peter the Great in 1714 began construction of the Monplaisir (\"my pleasure\") Palace, his Summer Palace, based on his own sketches of the palace that he wanted close to the shoreline. He later expanded his plans to include a vaster royal ch\u00e2teau of palaces and gardens further inland, on the model of Versailles. Peter the Great completed his project by 1725. Following tsars magnified on the inland palaces and gardens of Peterhof. Afterwards the Alexandrine Park and Upper Gardens were constructed so as the Samson Fountain and its massive pedestal installed in the Sea Channel. And finally, the Grand Palace was elevated to central and eminent status.Peter the Great designed the Summer Garden in 1704, with the assistance of the Dutch gardener Nicolaas Bidloo and Jan Roosen. Later, French architect Jean-Baptiste Le Blond added French style/flavor into it, mimicking Versailles. The Garden was completed in 1719. Near 250 (now less than 90 left) allegorical marble sculptures lined the walks. The fountains (near 30), the oldest in Russia, were the main attraction. Interestingly, Peter the Great personally acquired the fountain machinery from Britain.The Park was truly spectacular!"

You could spend half a day walking around seeing all the beautiful fountains. The coolest part I thought was the \"joke rocks\", If you step on certain rocks, you get hit with water. My daughter had fun with that. The main difference with Versailles and Peterhof is at Versailles you walk around and stare at beautiful fountains. At Peterhof your kids get to run through some of the fountains and enjoy a beautiful day."

Was there early in the morning (9 ish) Buy tickets for the gardens (2 parts : lower and higher) and if you have a lot of time you can buy separate tickets for the Palace. The main fountain (Samson fountain) will start at 11.00 am. The others ones were already \"on\" at 9.30 . You can go by boat (expensive) and by bus (long trip) or Taxi which is reasonable priced. With the taxi you see also some parts of St Petersburg without the glimmer and glamour. If you want a drink or another refreshment go to the \"Bolshaya\" orangerie which is near the Samson fountain and not so crowded."

The palace interiors combine the magnificent public rooms with more intimate, though still grand, private quarters. After a little over an hour inside we headed out to the gardens. By that time there were crowds waiting for the fountains to start up.. The best spot to get photos is from the bridge half way down the canal between the Palace and the Gulf of Finland but you'll have to be quick and pushy to get to the front.You have to wear overshoes as you walk round and can't take in backpacks or large bags - it is better to go prepared so you don't have to leave things in the cloakrooms.

The rooms were lavishly furnished and decorated and really took the breath away - worth all the hassle of getting there. The signage is very poor in English and we ended up tagging along on a Russian tour (rather than wait again for an English one).

Moreover, you're forced to rush through the different rooms of the palace. You don't even have the time to read the explanations in English, because another group is on your heels and you're literally pushed into the next room. To make things even worse, the guide was being utterly rude to some of the foreign tourists, who apparently and luckily didn't understand what she was saying. Embarrassing...Conclusion: make sure to have your tickets in time and be in the right linguistic group ;-)"

It began with a hydrofoil into the Gulf of Finland to arrive at Peterhof at the jetty - this is the best way to arrive, as the palace reveals itself as you approach it the same way that Peter the Great himself did, along the Sea Canal.When we got there, just before 11 am, the place was packed solid as at 11 am every day, they open the valves to start the fountains to the tune of Peter the Great\u2019s anthem - a truly magical moment and quite possibly the most beautiful sight I have ever seen (and I have seen a lot).All the fountains in the park are gravity-fed \u2013 there are no pumps at all.The colours of the gilded statues glowing in the sunlight, coupled with the green tiles of the Grand Cascade is truly memorable. Up to the Palace itself. Photography is, alas, forbidden in any of the palaces.Peter originally only had the central part but after his death, Elizabeth had it enlarged \u2013 as she seemed to do with every palace !! It had a mixture of baroque and classical designs, as well as several Chinese rooms with a dragon motif in one and a phoenix in another \u2013 in Chinese mythology, the dragon represents the Emperor and the Phoenix, the Empress. The kitchen contained pots and cups which were a gift from the Chinese Emperor.Our next stop was the Monplaisir Palace. This was Peter\u2019s home and it was decorated much more sedately with his study and bedroom small and oak-lined to resemble ship\u2019s cabins. On the water-side is a balustraded terrace that looks directly onto the Gulf of Finland, with St Petersburg visible on a fine day.The Chessboard Hill Cascade, Adam and Eve Fountains, the Lion Cascade, Roman Fountains, the Sun Fountain, the Triton Fountain, the Hermitage Pavilion that Catherine had built to \u201cget away from it all\u201d \u2013 she had the whole second floor to herself with a pulley system to raise a table up from the ground floor where it had been set by servants so she literally did not have to see or hear from anyone. The Pavilion is even surrounded by a moat. There is so much to see and admire amongst the extensive grounds.The Marly Palace \u2013 only eight rooms and another private pavilion near which is the Golden Hill Cascade, at the top of which is a beautiful view over the Gulf.Keep an eye out for the trick fountains that turn on unexpectedly to catch unsuspecting visitors.Our tour lasted from 09:30 - 16:30 and there was still so much we didn't see.It poured rain for part of the time we were there, but even that could not dampen my enjoyment of this place.The hydrofoils leave from the Palace Embankment throughout the day and entrance to the park grounds is free so on a fine day, this would be a fabulous place to just hang out and explore. Room for the kids to run amok and they will love the trick fountains.A supremely beautiful place. "

The most convenient - even expensive ($17- adult and $13-child - two way) - is by boat, because it complements the impression of a visit to park and palaces. The park is open from the morning, and the Grand Palace from noon. You have to stand in the qeue well before. But that is worth it. Very beautiful palace and the park. Fountains start tp operate at 11 a.m. There are also funny fountains for kids, not far from Monplaisir palace. All in all, one can spent a day in Peterhof."

No information anywhere about how to enter which museum and when. No information about exits and entries. People speak little English but don't explain you anything. \"wait here for 15min\" we were told, but why? And what's going to happen? We don't know.

You buy the ticket to enter the location with the gardens as you get off the boat. This ticket will only give you access to the gardens. To get in the palace you will need to buy another ticket. Between 14:15 (or maybe it was 15:15) and 16:15 this ticket counter for the palace is closed. And once it open the line is already very big. Chance is you could stay about 1h in line. We were lucky as a couple of wonderful Russians stayed in line and got us the tickets while we just walked around the gardens. As we got in the palaceall russian people were grouped and they got a guide who explained to them what each of the rooms was about. There was no English guide so we just wondered around reading the notes in each room. The rooms were absolutely gorgeous! I tried to buy tickets online before getting there but i did not find the way to do so. If you manage this, more power to you! :-)"

As a result, we were listening to her commentary of a room two ahead of the one we were in, hence it made little sense. She tried to protest but it just became a heated argument with the staff in the rooms. The fountains and the gardens are also beautiful, and absorbed the crowds more easily. However any spot that provided a good photo opportunity literally became a scrum. In all my years of travelling I have never experienced anything quite like this. Our guide actually said that the gardens were quiet during our visit - when more cruise ships are in, it is considerably worse.On a positive note, there are plenty of refreshment outlets and toilets - although you might have to wait a while. My advice to anyone planning a visit is to go out of season. I would also advise that you know the history of the palace before you visit - then you know what you're looking at & are not reliant on the commentary (something I wished I'd done). However it is definitely worth a visit providing you can get to see it!"

            "review": "Spectacular Palace and Fountains. The Grand Palace is located in a town about 45 to 60 minutes away from St. Petersburg. The palace and gardens is segregated into the Upper and Lower Gardens. You\u2019ll have to pay an entrance free for the lower gardens, which includes the Grand Palace and the Grand Cascades, whereas the Upper Gardens are free to all visitors. Visitors to the Grand Palace will have to wear shoe covers before entry, and the security is quite strict about the rules; e.g. guests cannot bring water into the palace. Also note that if it is raining outside, you\u2019ll have to remove your outer coats and keep it in the cloakroom. Photography and other forms of recording are prohibited inside the palace. Photography however is allowed outside on the palace grounds, and you should really go all out to take as many as you can because the Grand Cascades are really beautiful with all the different ornate designs. The fountains are turned on each day (from mid-May to October) at 11am so head on down early to grab a good spot if you wish to capture the moment. The piping systems of the fountains function purely by virtue of gravity, so it is really cool to see how such a simple design (and I don\u2019t mean it in a derogatory way) can produce something so magnificent."

Nothing compares to the glistening gold coupled by the unmistakable whiff of old Tsar grandeur. In my mind it was better than Versailles (either due to the gold or my dislike of the French) as its fountains and remarkable survival across the more checkered part of Russian history. It just adds to how timeless it is. It was as if I had graced the courts of Catherine the Great. The only difference being that the silk of royal dresses were replaced with high white socks and kharki. Having a Russian take you round really does give you a great perspective on the art, and how the Russian royalty may have lived. Yes I suppose that its quite hypocritical to say that I didn't like the crowds, especially because I was part of them myself but still the crowds were beyond belief. Tour after tour after tour. The court of Catherine the Great was quite dense but could not compare to a room stuffed with tourists desperately trying to take a photo of a royal chamber pot. One cannot deny the amazing things on show, the rooms, the grounds, it all. However it doesn't matter how shiny your gold fountain is, it counts for nought if all the view you get is of a middle aged Americans combover. My advice, go when the winter makes them fly west and marvel at the sheer beauty on show."

            "review": "Self guided independent tour visit - yes its possible. I decided to try this without a guide and wanted to recall a few pointers before I forget.I just walked to the boat docks directly behind the Hermitage. They want cash (1300R for round trip) but NOT a 5000 note. Everyplace I went seemed to be low on 100's so they are looking for them. Bring 1000, 500 and 100s if you can. The hydrofoils seem to be running before 10 (which is the start time I have read). There were 'ticket booths' selling the hydrofoil tickets (on the side of the Hermitage) but I was worried there would be different companies and I would then have to search for the correct boat dock, so I just qued and purchased directly there, After purchasing your ticket, you get in line for a hydrofoil. Tour groups get priority loading from a slightly different gangplank, but it is the same boats. I just missed the 9:30 boat and got on the one that left at 10:00. If possible, pick a day that has a good weather forecast, as they will cancel the hydrofoil if it is raining too hard, etc. It might help that you have looked at a metro map so you have an idea what your 'back up' plan is if need be (heard story from another tourist this happened to and it was a bit of a nightmare for them). The journey in NOT really scenic but it was smooth the day I went. I get seasick so this was a blessing. I was fine, even tho the wind had picked up for the return. When you get off the hydrofoil you walk a fair amount down the dock and come to the ticket booth. This is only the booth to get into the lower harder (700R). In fact, there is no where you can buy a combined ticket. Each 'attraction' requires its own ticket purchase. I decided to get into line right away for the Grand Palace (missing the 11:00 start of the big fountain which is supposed to be a bit of a highlight).The line for groups and foreigners is directly up the fountain steps. The line opened before 11 which is about when I entered. The line for Russians is further down to the right and I believe their palace access starts at 12. So my ticket was not really time stamped but they wanted you to enter the palace directly. WC is on the left of the ticket office and the somewhat mandatory but free cloakroom is to the right. You stop and pick up shoe covers just before entering the palace. No photos are allowed in the palace, I think to keep the groups moving. As an individual, you often have to squeeze by the slow moving groups. The guides do not seem to make much of an effort to corral their groups to allow a 'traffic' lane. The palace is spectacular and a bit like a mini-Hermitage (I've not been to Catherine's Palace yet, but rom the photos the decoration style also seems similiar). It takes under an hour to flow through. There is a description in English in most of the rooms and there were many English speaking guided groups going through. Having read a fair amount about the family, history, etc. I did not feel I missed much from what I could hear the guides saying. As for the rest of the grounds. I took the little train (running Russian commentary) to get a sense of the scale of the park. The train goes out of the lower garden park bounds past the farm palace and gothic cathedral). Makes a loop on that side of the grounds. It was 350R and I am glad I did it just to save steps. I did not go into any of the other palaces as they seemed fairly small. True restaurants are a bit hard to find. There is one all the way at the 'golden cascade/MArly palace' end that is not on the map. The main one is on a diagonal path shortly after you would be approaching the fountain steps from the boat dock (right side). The rest are little kiosks selling hot-dog type food and snacks. As is everything in Russia, a lot of walking is required. I saw a few golf carts (Russian commentary) but I think they have to be arranged in advance. Even though I am now trying to walk as little as possible (because my legs are tired from day after day of 18,000- 23,000 steps a day, this was another 20,000+ step day (about 10 miles). I think most of the group tours only cover the palace and the main fountain. If you want to save steps and time, this is enough, I was a little underwhelmed by the rest of the gardens/fountains. It is a nice day if you want to get out into nature and can bring your own food. Also, look at the upper gardens from the palace windows, because it is my understanding you can not really enter them (even though they are 'free') as it would involve an exit from the lower garden. According to the signs, you would have to pay another 700 to re-enter the lower garden for you return hydrofoil trip.I was in line with russian speaking americans who had heard you could show your return ticket and get a stamp from the administration building. They asked the lady selling the tickets about this. She said no, I have seen this 'free re-entry' scheme referenced on other web sites but without language skills, I think it would be nearly impossible to negotiate. Also, I did not see here any automatic ticket booths anywhere, you stand in the line to purchase the ticket then pretty much directly proceed through the rest of the 'process' to enter the palace. On the hydrofoil return, I could see one that was getting ready to depart, so I just went to that one (even though it was not the same as the one I cam on in terms of the exterior branding). There were people queuing for other hydrofoils. When I returned (3:30) there was no line for the tickets or the hydrofoil, so you may want to consider leaving later in the day. Hope this helps!"

To see how lavishly the Romanovs lived was eye opening to say the least! Definitely take an organised your- don't try doing it yourself. We were pleasantly surprised to have free time to browse the gardens ourselves. They were beautiful even on an overcast and rainy day. The hydrofoil back to the city afforded great views of many city sites. Would recommend the palace visit for sure. We coupled this with the Peter and Paul cathedral and fortress due to the Romanov link but would not bother with that. Instead, go to the Spilled Blood cathedral and do the inside - that is our one regret! If you are on a cruise as we were, we would recommend you organise your own visas and a private guide to tour what you want. That way you can stop off at the arty areas as well and see St Petersburg by night- it is magical."

            "review": "Choose a sunny day and spend your time wandering the gardens and seeing fountains. We lucked out and got one of the sixty-something sunny days per year in this region when we went here. Honestly, it's a place to see when it's warmer and the sun is shining, because otherwise, you'll be wandering through huge grounds in the rain. We also got lucky in that we used Google Maps to drive here from St. Petersburg, and it took us directly to a remote (not the main) entrance that wasn't very busy. We found street parking right across from the entrance and were set. It's not too expensive to go inside of the grounds, which gives you access to many acres of gardens (sometimes just trees and grass, sometimes roses and other flowers) and a multitude of fountains. The fountains are honestly the coolest part of this whole place. They are gravity fountains, like at Versailles. They have been operating for hundreds of years, with some refurbishment of pipes and whatnot, but they work exactly the same way as they did when originally designed - which is pretty darn amazing. They basically use varying sizes of pipes (wider or narrower diameter) to get different height/strength flows. We saw a fountain that had many jets creating a pyramid, some fountains that have cool statues in the centers of them, simple fountains with cherub-like babies with split scaly, fish tails, the terraces of fountains in front of the palace, and the cool trick fountains (that kids LOVE to play in). There are some signs directing you down lanes in the gardens to fountains, but we found the online maps to be better...if you know in advance you're going here and won't have internet access, I'd find the maps before going and take screen shots of your phone. We also paid to go into the main palace. The ticket line only sells tickets during certain hours, and be prepared to wait in a line for an hour or longer if you want a shot at getting any of them. Bring an umbrella to block the sun, and I absolutely would have died without my fan. Once you pay, follow the hoardes of people. If you have backpacks, you'll have to check them. No photos are allowed inside, but I would recommend you keep your nice cameras or other pricey valuables on you rather than leave them at the coat check if possible. They will make you grab shoe covers to wear in the coat check area, be sure to grab yours and put them on or you're not going in. Next, they will hand out these really convenient receivers for people to hear their tour guide. They were awesome because the tour guides didn't have to raise their voices at ALL for their group to hear them, so you could be around multiple groups and everyone would be pretty quiet, listening to their guides. Now, unfortunately, they didn't have any English speaking tour guides when we were there! But, that meant we were able to wander through the palace (it all flows in one direction from room to room), reading the signs at various spots in the room, which they conveniently had in both Cyrillic and English. Sometimes this was great because when a smaller room would get too crowded, we would gently work through the crowd on the edges and move ahead or lag behind so we had room to breathe. There are a couple of rooms that you must continuously walk through (no stopping!), probably because they're too narrow to allow for people to block the areas. As long as you keep slowly moving forward, you can take a minute to glance from side to side to take in the decor and furniture. There are murals, awesome glass/crystal chandeliers, cool pieces of furniture and awesome parquetry on the floors. After a bit, you'll feel immune to the opulence of the palace, and get the message - we're rich and can do whatever we want! But the crowds, small rooms, and lack of air conditioning can put a real damper on your level of enjoyment, depending on how sensitive you are about those things. Definitely take a fan with you. As you walk out, buy a nice soda from the gift shop, and it'll be a great boost to your energy levels.Personally, while it was a fantastic palace and a sight to see, I would have been just as happy to stay outside in the gardens, enjoying the fountains and air."

The good thing about the rain is there were not as many people there. The Hermitage was packed that day as we later leaned from a fellow cruise passenger. So we had a great time despite the rain."

It was all over in 30 minutes, whilst we were able to enjoy the gardens for six hours even on an overcast day with wind and drizzle.

This is an extraordinary palace with grand fountains and gardens that are quite spacious. The palace itself is beautiful and gives quite a glimpse into the times of imperial Russia. Honestly it took my breath away! Our guide was very knowledgeable and able to answer all sorts of questions. The gardens are expansive and absolutely beautiful with elaborate fountains found nearly at every turn. Several \"trick\" fountains can also be found on the grounds so be careful where you decide to sit for a spell. Apparently Peter the Great was quite the trickster ! Hopefully you have time to stroll at your leisure there is so much to see - the main fountains are turned on at 11:00 and its spectacular. All the fountains on the property are fed by gravity there are no pumps involved - that in of itself is quite remarkable !"

We overcame this by purchasing street food we could eat whilst standing and holding an umbrella as there was little chance of a seat inside a food outlet.

Sunshine does make the gilded statues look more interesting.However I visited as part of a group tour and ended up shuffling through the palace first. Unless you get there at a time with no groups (almost impossible) it is definitely not worth going inside. You'll just be stuck among large groups of other tourists, slowly making their way through narrow pathways in each room. Hard to escape if you want to move faster - and even harder to take a closer look if you are interested in something. Most of the rooms are overloaded with gilded stuff in 'rokoko' style and you are not allowed to take photographs. Some people were close to fainting because of the sticky air and there is no place to rest until you get out again. Go to Katherine Palace instead, which is more roomy, so you can get away from the crowds - and you can photograph as much as you like.Take the Hydrofoil back to Hermitage - much bigger than bus or car."

As a result the time was limited, but the upside was the early entry prior to the crowds being let in. The viewing within the Palace was quite good, but was a tad too fast to take it all in. Rules are that you cannot take photos inside, so its just memories and the books that you can buy.The gardens are well worth a visit, but again we did not have enough time to really take it all in. The 'turning on' of the fountain is a high light, but unfortunately there is a lot of pushing and inconsiderate actions by other tourists to take the edge off the viewing. If you want a clear photo/video of the fountains best to wait 30 to 45 minutes after the fountains are turned on (ie take a walk through the gardens in the meantime), and return once most of the tourists are gone and plenty of great photos without others in the pic are available.Definitely worth a visit.,"

Not only is Peterhof beautiful in its architecture, including the outdoor grounds and fountains, but it is also one of those select buildings that Russia has chosen to perfectly preserve. No doubt more are coming but clearly Peterhof was among the first.In fact, it may be the case that one of the reasons this building is in pristine form is that Prime Minister Putin, at a time when he was in the lower echelon, was put in charge of renovating it. No doubt it has remained close to his heart, even today. Indeed, some of the gold leaf is covered with Lucite to guard it. Visitors need to remove their shoes and wear paper slippers to protect the floors. Photography is forbidden here (you can't even pay to do it), so I had to purchase a book.Each room has a clear theme. Most incredible was the Amber Room. Wow! Having been to places such as Versailles and the Schonbrunn Palace, I have to tell you that Peterhof is in that class and beyond. Try to make it on a sunny day, so that you can also enjoy the grounds and the spectacular fountains.Our group had a guide and, given the crowds and hectic confusion, I would highly recommend hiring one. Despite the chaos, our guide managed to get us in, around, and out onto the grounds with excellent dispatch. I really don't know how you could do without it. Since we had a van and driver at our disposal, we drove out here rather than taking the hydrofoil."

The Peterhof Palace and it's fountains and grounds are a must do---absolutely beautiful! The fountains come on at 11am, and you'll want to see them running. Lots of different fountains, and since it was early May when we were there, plenty of pretty flowers. You can easily spend hours just seeing the fountains. There are other little buildings to see besides the main Palace, but most where not open for the summer yet, so you'll have to check the open dates for extra stuff. You don't see that many rooms inside the palace---but the ones you do visit are really opulent and lovely. Getting There: You can do this on your own, you don't have to pay a tour company. You can catch a boat right by the Winter Palace for a 30 minute ride to Peterhof (we did), or you can catch a bus. The price for our boat tickets was pretty reasonable. The boat drops you off at the end of the Lower Park, then you walk through it up to the Palace. I think the buses must drop you off at the Upper Park--we never saw where they stop, and I don't know how long the bus ride is.Good luck getting your tickets! This is were the bureaucracy goes crazy. The Peterhof is split into the Lower Park, the Palace itself, and the Upper Park. You have to buy a separate ticket for each thing---and frustratingly, you buy then from separate ticket booths so you get to stand in line multiple times. PALACE TICKETS: THEY DIVIDE THE DAY INTO TIMES WHEN THEY SELL ONLY TO RUSSIANS, AND TIMES WHEN THEY SELL ONLY TO NON RUSSIANS (different pricing). Don't get in line at the wrong time! The signs are useless, they don't explain this. We waited for one hour in the Palace line (a single person in a single ticket booth sold tickets to hundreds of people). When we got to the front of the line, the guard outside told us they were only selling to Russians in that time slot. Fortunately, when we said how long we had waited she let us and 2 Germans behind us in. But then the woman at the ticket counter almost refused us---in the end she sold us just the Palace ticket, but she wouldn't sell us special collection tickets or any of the other extras. And the Upper Park is, from what we could tell, impossible to visit if you came from the Lower Park first. There is a high fence all around it. The turnstiles let people from the Upper Park go through to the Lower Park as long as they show there ticket, but we could not enter the Upper Park there. They wouldn't even tell us where to go to buy a ticket. I actually had a woman minding the turnstile scream \"Nyet!\"at me and turn away from me like I wasn't there anymore. So we never got to see anything in the Upper Park.All that said, as frustrating as it was trying to get tickets and never seeing the Upper Park, what we DID see at the Peterhof was totally worth it and I would do it again. What a beautiful setting, and man those fountains were spectacular!"

Peterhof was spectacular and gorgeous, but it takes a lot of time to get there and to explore the grounds. We went by hydrofoil boat which was really fun. It was a beautiful experience, but there's just so much to do in SPB with a limited amount of time, and Peterhof requires at least half the day to really enjoy it. There are lots of other palaces and fountains in the city, though not hardly as grand. If seeing Peterhof is a priority for you, definitely go, but if there are lots of other things on your list, Peterhof can be for your next visit!"

While the online stuff I read tells you to only come by boat to experience the best presentation, I think that arrival by car would be fine too. Yes, seeing the palace growing bigger as it is approached is pretty cool, but Uber would be a lot less than the boat, and you can always save the approach part until after you've explored the grounds and are walking back to ground transportation. We needed another few hours at the place to do it justice, but we simply didn't have the place to add any--we had some issue come up earlier in the day. Still, the 3 hours spent there didn't feel too rushed. Our daughter may disagree. I'm afraid to investigate what spectacles we missed...Something needs to be done to make this place more efficiently run with the ticketing process. I get the concept that there are those who only see the grounds, but to have multiple ticket booths and vouchers that need to be wchsnged for tickets is unnecessary. We were amused by the booties we had to put over our shoes. Slippery walking. This shows how revered this place is. Haven't ever seen that in the States. We were disappointed that the audio guide in English wasn't available. My wife is blind, and was hoping to get more from the time than just a walk on my side while I read the signs while Russian language groups ushered us along.I gestured toward an item while trying to describe it to my wife. This was unintended; I speak with my hands, I guess. Anyway, I set off a motion detector alatm when my hand went too close (it crossed beyond the rope). The place is run by retirement aged women. Two of them escorted me to the next room, reset the system and that was that. Tone was assertive, not angry. I have no idea what was actually said.Gold, lacquer, silk, parquet, porcelain and grandeur. Portraits of important dead people who lived lives clearly without any knowledge of how everyone else lives. Learning that Catherine the whatever-th would be painted into pictures of Minerva was cool. I loved the woodworking.We'd go again should the opportunity present itself."

When you see the pictures of the devastated Palace after WWII and compare it with this beautifully restored Palace you can but be amazed. For this I would give Peterhof an excellent rating, but for our overall experience, it would be closer to poor, mind you the dreadful weather did not help and this was mid June.We arrived to get tickets for the Hydrofoil at 0915, but the first one available was at 1100 so we decided to book for 2 days later at 1000 with Astra. We arrived to join a small queue but as we went to get on the boat we were held back until all the window seats were taken. They pointed to something on our ticket that said we could not board until the end of the queue, we never figured out what it was. Also there was a business class cabin but we had not been offered this. A good start to the day!We arrived at Peterhof at 1030 to heaving seas, it took 3 men to heave one of the larger ladies onto the quay!!As another contributor has said you then pay 600 roubles pp to get into the grounds, but cannot pay for any of the other places at this point. It was now drizzling unpleasantly so we walked towards the main building to get tickets. On the way up was found crowds of people waiting to see the fountains start at 1100, so decided to wait with them. My husband and a Russian entertained those who were bilingual in the crowd, with a conversation in their own languages, the only common word being vodka!! The view up to the Palace was awe inspiring with all the gold statues and fountains. Sure enough the fountains started at 1100 but we couldn't work out why everyone had waited as they then stayed on all day!!At 1115 we joined a queue to buy tickets for the main Palace, ticket office opens at 1030 said the signs. After 20 minutes the queue had not moved and a young Beleruss man explained that the office did not open until 1200. As 1200 neared just about every Russian in the queue had friends or relatives join them so the queue in front got longer and it took a while to start moving! We were given tickets that were valid for 1430 whereas the Belerussians got in straight away. We foolishly thought that this must be because there was an English guide at 1430.Having stood in the queue for so long I now needed the lavatory, we followed the WC signs and an obviously desperate American girl only to find the biggest queue I have ever seen. My husband went off to the gents, and then came back and waved to me. The desperate American girl was just coming out of the gents and 3 large Russian ladies and myself went in. It was perfectly decent you just had to walk past a line of men facing the wall, however by the time I came out there was a female cleaner who prevented any other ladies from entering.By now it was starting to rain quite heavily so we jumped on the train. We should have bought tickets but my husband gave the 700roubles to the ticket checker chap, he accepted reluctantly. The train went into the lower park and past about 3 buildings, one a farm, there was a continuous commentary in Russian. Other than wasting time until our Palace tour it was not worth 350 roubles each. On a nice day it would have been great to walk there and get away from the crowds.We then went for our Palace tour. We just had to fight our way round amongst the groups. Maybe we should have got a private guide but the holiday had been last minute and we had not been able to get the tours we wanted on the days we were free.The weather was deteriorating, but the Bath House had been recommended on Tripadvisor and at least it was out of the rain. it was another 350 roubles each or maybe 300. The first building was not that interesting, the Japanese Garden OK and the Bath House with its communal shower about the only thing that made it maybe worthwhile.We decided to try to get an earlier hydrofoil back, at 1700. However Astra hydrofoils had stopped running altogether, due to the weather and we had to book and pay again with another company, their next tickets were for 1800. Astra would not give us a refund as we had the tickets but the coupon was missing. It turned out that the maid in the Hotel had put it in a drawer so I had not seen it was missing. we did eventually get the refund.There was a tented cafe near to the dock so we were able to take shelter whilst we waited.In summary - a great place magnificent Palace but they need to do better at managing the crowds, providing maps and more information (ideally in languages other than Russian as well) and provide more toilets."

We knew of individual times for entry. We were not allowed to purchase tickets to the palace on-line, however. Why? We had no idea. We took the hydrofoil and arrived at 11:30 am, to complete chaos. First, we had to pay park entry. One can purchase no other tickets at the entrance. But, the confusion and lack of information is staggering. We were provided no map, nor could we find one anywhere we asked. Once we purchased the park entry ticket we went straight to the palace to purchase the entry ticket for it. The line was two hours long and that was the only window of time until later in the day. So, we wandered the park only to find many other options of buildings to see, all requiring a high fee, especially the church. We inquired about how to purchase a combined ticket but no one speaks English anywhere. The best we could figure out is that there is no combined ticket. Everywhere we went we saw people trying to figure out what to do and not paying a separate entry fee for the other buildings because the fees are exorbitant. So, we entered none of these buildings and came back to get in line for purchasing tickets for the afternoon entry time. We discovered the on-line information to be incorrect and found a line for individuals that was allowed in with the groups. We chatted with a Russian in this line who complained that even he had not been able to figure it out. He had waited in the first line for an hour and a half and not been allowed to buy a ticket. It is inexcusable but we finally realized that only groups are welcome here. Entry for individuals is made as difficult as possible in order to discourage them. And, to top it all off, the \u201cfree\u201d upper gardens are not free at all. Once you have entered the lower gardens you cannot leave and return. But, the only way to see the upper gardens is to leave. So, no one who takes the water route can see them without paying two entry fees. Ridiculous! Yes, there are fountains and nice grounds, but they were not worth the trip. Neither was the palace. Once you\u2019re inside, it is overcrowded; you are squeezed through along with large guided groups so you can hardly get a chance to see anything, though the wholly re-created interiors are splendid. Even the tour groups looked bored, and were going so quickly through the palace, that they could not have enjoyed the harried experience either.Save your sanity and go to another palace."

Despite many of the reviews I read recommended taking hydrofoil during summer time, I personally think metro + bus / mini bus is not bad too (I tried this mean for my return trip), because it's cheaper (R105 vs R750 per head), much shorter waiting time, plus there's actually not much scenery along the sea route to Peterhof.Lower Park and the fountains are beautiful."

The Palace doesn't seem to have been restored with the same attention to detail and care as other attractions. The gardens are lovely, but bordering on kitsch. There are a number of \"amusements\" installed where if you walk to a bench or over a stone path sprinklers or other water features turn on (apparently a real \"hoot\" back in the day!).

            "review": "Great outdoor for everyone. Peterhof is such a great place to visit. In a summertime, it is not too hot due to the location by the sea (Finland Gulf). We spent most of the time in the garden area (upper and lower). Next visit will try the indoor exhibition. We love the fountains!! The kids would love going there for the trick fountains (the water splash in the restricted areas across the lower gardens). In May, you can still see some colorful tulips in the gardens. Hi-light is the main fountain that runs through the gulf. It is absolutely breathtaking! To get there, taking metro red line (M1) and getting off at Batiskaya station. Then make your way through the way out to hop on the minibus no 404 (you can see it right away, can't miss it) with the name Peterhof on it (costs 70 RUB/person). Pay in cash only to the driver himself. The bus took roughly 30-45 minutes. It passes the presidential residence of Russia (locating near the palace) as well. Get off at the main gate, the bus driver will shout the name out loud. It takes around 2-3 hours walking in the huge park. There are ice-cream and drink vendors everywhere. However, the toilets are quite limited. If you are going to have lunch there, I recommend having in the proper restaurant so that you can use their toilet for free (and cleaner). Toilet in the upper garden is paid-toilet (30 RUB). Another one in the lower garden is free (but extremely crowded and not so clean). To get back to St. Petersburg, cruising along the gulf with hydrofoil, a russian style ferry, is a must. You can purchase the ticket around the bay area, it costs 550 RUB for one way. The piers are just 10 minutes walk. The boat itself is quite old but still very good quality. The website says the cruising trip takes 30 minutes (they even claimed that it is faster than bus because of no traffic). However, for our trip, it was 45 minutes long!! (Don't know why!)Anyway, I still enjoy the trip. Strongly recommended!"

Wheelchairs available at the palace ( no charge, you just leave an ID as a guarantee). You'll have to wear shoes covers to visit the palace.

The excursion also included the Hermitage Palace. Peterhof wows you from the moment you set eyes on it. The real gold domes and adornments sparkle like precious gems come rain or come shine. The spectacular fountains surrounded by gilded statuary gain even more attention at 11am when the fountains release their plumes of water to a beautiful symphony of music. The canal leading from the fountains feeds right into the Baltic Sea, making this a well planned defensive location by it's designer, Peter the Great. Stash your cameras once you get inside the palace. No photography is allowed. Hoards of tourists flock to Peterhof by the bus load. The tour pace is quite fast inside with no time to loiter or stare very long at each room. A Russian woman is seated in each room watching each person to ensure you don't become too familiar with anything you see. Their appearance is fairly stern with no smile in return. All palace rooms are chocked with much to take in, but little time to give more than a passing glance...It's still amazing to visit. I enjoyed the gardens which featured mostly beautiful tulips at this time of year. Lilacs were also a nice fragrant feature that we saw in each of the Baltic regions. Take note of the lovely white marble statues that flank the chessboard fountain at Peterhof. Each statue was buried under ground during WWII to preserve them. I hope you enjoy your visit as much as we did. Would like to have had more time."

We travelled to and from Petergof by hydrofoil, which felt like a trip into the future we expected in the 1970s - a future of hydrofoils, hovercraft, and Concorde supersonic planes. Highly recommended, before they all get retired as uneconomic.If you take the 10am hydrofoil and then walk briskly along the canal you can bag a place on the bridge and watch the fountains get turned on (to music) at 11am.Petergof itself is spectacular. I was last here in the 1990s and it has been substantially fixed up. All the fountains fully working and well maintained; the grounds well kept; toilets clean; snack and ice cream kiosks sprinkled about.As others have noted, each attraction is 'a la carte' - we did a couple but couldn't stomach the queue for the palace. The Hermitage with its art display and mechanical lifting table wasn't worth the 500 roubles entrance.We just enjoyed strolling around the grounds, visiting each fountain, and people watching. Be sure to visit the 'joke' fountains, especially the one on the main path that is only activated 3 times a day (1pm, 3pm, ???). Just follow the shrieks and laughs of children and enjoy the fun. If you have kids, consider whether you want to let them play in the joke fountains and get wet, and bring appropriate clothes.We ate at one of the kiosks and it was serviceable. The ice cream was fine though!Note that the kiosks sell nuts to feed the squirrels, which we passed on. Good thing too, as we only saw one squirrel all day and he was clearly so overfed he wasn't interested in what the other tourists were offering!"

They allow a few people at a time to keep a proper flow through the palace.You only see a few rooms in the palace. The whole place was rebuild in the 1960s since it was burned and abandoned before. All the interior contents (paintings, pictures, decorations, furniture,etc) are representatives of the era and not original. Nice job though on the the rebuild.The fountains were very beautiful and the garden was nice. The food sold there is terrible.

There are lots of baroque style rooms. The unique room is made of amber on the wall quite beautiful. Took a lot of work to refurbish after the war. Many restoration specialists went through photos to get the right color of stone to make it as close to original as possible. The fountain though is unique. It is run entirely without pumps. A must see! You can get here easily by one of the hydrofoils from St Petersburg. Faster than driving."

Walking through the Lower Gardens was lovely even though it was raining. Came to the ticket office and that seemed to be when the problems started.Trying to get a ticket was a joke - first the ticket office told us that we had to go through the entrance barriers - which we couldn't do as we had no ticket and the staff on the ticket barriers told us to go back to the ticket office to get a ticket to gain access to the gardens of the Grand Palace.... and then you can get another ticket to gain entrance to the Grand Palace. So off we went to get our garden ticket and then went through to view the gardens. Spent some time taking photos of the gold statues and the exterior. The garden was stunning. We then went to buy our tickets for the Grand Palace. Something I was looking forward too. First we went into a queue only to be told by a guard that the tour was for Russian people only and we could go in at 2pm. We then tried to find another ticket office as we werent sure if we understood te guard and came upon a door with a guard only to be turned away again saying Russians only. As we didn't understand Russian that was all we could decipher. Luckily a couple came out and we asked them did they have problems getting in to which they replied no. One of them went over to find out what the problem was. It seems up until midday anyone can go into the Grand Palace, but from 12-2pm its for Russian only and then from 2pm onward anyone can go in. This isn't mentioned on their website and seems rather odd. As that meant we would have to wait nearly 2 hours. In the end we didn't bother waiting as by then we had been in the rain for sometime and had we known before we would either have left earlier or visited later. The gardens were lovely but it was a waste of our time going given that we wanted to see the interior.Also take note if you have gained access to the garden but want to go to the toilet or coffee you have to leave the complex and you will not be allowed back in - as your ticket is only valid for one entry."

Traveling here: maybe 30 minutes (+-15 minutes) by taxi. A taxi drive from this place can cost quite a bit because they take advantage of the situation that it's not easy to travel from here. Make sure the same driver you first hired picks you up or waits for you there. The palace takes a fee for entering, I'm not sure about the park."

Here, you will see unique sights like detached, luxury houses, luxury hotels / spas & lots of green & very well manicured gardens, lawns & parks.The Grand Palace & surrounding park is of exceptional beauty & architectural quality - much like St Petersburg but on an even higher level!Passing Samson fountain provides lots of photo opportunities & as you head down to the seafront there are plenty of very good restaurants catering for all tastes including vegetarian.One thing we missed out on is really exploring all the extensive grounds which are readily accessible on any of the numerous hire bikes - highly recommended if you want to (1) see the extensive grounds to the east; (2) enjoy a lot of peace & quiet from the hordes of tourists (many native Russians visit); (3) feel like you have the whole place to yourself - prepare your own picnic! ))The place is very safe & you have the freedom to do as you please - budget for a whole day & plan to arrive around 10am to gain the most from any visit & make it a very good value for money day out.Plenty of photo opportunities so make sure everything is fully charged & plenty of small parks for the children to enjoy too!Tickets are always available on the day, so always check the local forecast & pick the sunniest & warmest day for your trip - can get a little chilly by the sea so always carry a mac!Enjoy! ))"

It was difficult to enjoy the museum with the employees constantly rushing us through the gallery. The museum is a narrow gallery of gala rooms which should take about 30-40 minutes to walk through, due to the crowds and poor management it took us about 1.5 hours to visit (+1 hour in line) and find ourselves in the tourist trap souvenir shop as the only exit to the park. My advice: spend more time in the park and visit a smaller palace in the Lower fountain park rather than losing time in line to go inside the Grand Palace."

We timed our explore so that we were at the Grand Cascade just before it was turned on for the day. Seeing it come to life was absolutely great. We were impressed to learn that there are no pumps providing water pressure but and elaborate system of piping from large spring fed holding pools let gravity do the work, very clever engineering, ingenious\u2026 The Palace is a bit of a drive from the city.

Grand Palace, as well as some smaller palaces and mansions are just wonderfull. Add a number of fountains all imaginable forms and sizes (this place often called just like \"fountains of Petergoff\") and magnificent parks - Upper and Lower ones, with a lot of flowers, panoramic Finnish gulf view... The palace itself actually consists of 3 of 4 buildings and worth for visit also. Come early for not to spend much time in a queue. Be prepare some of warm cloth, it could be a wind from the gulf."

As we went in March, the fountains were not running but they were being uncovered to be serviced ready for switching on next month. The garden looked sad, but nothing looks good with dirty melting snow and were still interesting to wander round. The interiors were spectacular. White walls and gold leaf on any surface nailed down. With mirrored rooms, the impressions were magnificent. Again going in March, we practically had the place to ourselves. You could easily imagine war and peace scenes going on here."

Around 1720The Grand Palace is not the only historic royal building in Peterhof. The palaces of Monplaisir and Marly, as well as the pavilion known as the 'Hermitage', were all raised during the initial construction of Peterhof during the reign of Peter the Great. The Lower Gardens also contain a large greenhouse, and in the Alexandrine Park stands the palace of Nicholas I."

An impressive building overlooking the gardens at the lower level with water fountains dancing at the rhythm of \u200emusic when it's time for the program. A water channel approximately half a mile connects the gardens to the Baltic sea. The palace itself is not original. The original was destroyed by German occupational forces prior to their retreat. However the curators where able to move most of the paintings and the furnitures prior to German occupation. After the war the palace was rebuilt using the best available craftsmen and the \u200esalvaged paintings and decorations were reinstated in the building. May not be original but it gives an accurate impression of the times. Pictures in the interior are not allowed but the gardens offer some of the best shoots you can take."

There is so much gold on walls and all is in such amazing conditions. As it is winter now and a lot less tourist we did get to some parts and rooms which are normally closed during summer. After tour you still have a chance to go on your own. After i did some walks across the gardens and i cant wait to come back during summer.

There is then a bit of a walk along the waterways, before arriving at the bottom of the steps. Take a minute to drink in the splendour of the fountains and hopefully they are fully operating on the day you go. Then it is up to the top of the stairs to get your tickets and there are always queues and a lack of signposts as to which queue you should be in, so make sure you check.There is a point around mid day when the Palace closes, which seems very strange in this day and age. We opted to do the church, which although was another cost, it was nominal and worth a look, as it is stunning.The main palace takes a while to get into with the various levels security. Once inside you are herded through, so not a lot of time to soak in all of the contents. A big issue was very noisy groups of Chinese.For me the beauty of this place is in the church and outside when the fountains are flowing. You can also take a walk through the wooded area and you will find several places to eat, nothing startling, but okay."

The eighth wonder of the world, is said to be the The famous Amber room. the entire four walls were decorated with different colored amber mined in Siberia.

We had hired a private guide , it was a good investment as she could tell all the history of Peterhof and led us to the most important things,The Main Staircase, The Ballroom and The Throne Room are SO impressive , you can stay and watch and feel inside a fairytale.The main attraction of Peterhof is the park and the fountains. Unfortunately we arrived too late in autumn to see them in function, they were closed for winter.But if you have been to Versailles you can get the idea, just that Peterhof is bigger. There are so many fountains and statues in that well tended park.Admire the Great Cascade with all golden statues and look down the canal leading the waters from The Great Cascade to the Finnish Gulf. The guide told us that the water for the fountains arrives from 20 kilometers away! You also could sail up the canal from the sea,what a grand way to arrive to Peterhof.Even we did miss the water show it was enjoyable to walk in that great park.

We studied the map en route by Metro from Nevsky to Avtovo and van to Peterhof.The palace grounds were not as alive at they would be during summers and the water features were not working. Although I have walked in the gardens of Versailles one summer, I appreciate the splendour of Peterhof this winter. Cold. Stunningly beautiful.Our bad experience was at Avtovo. While going down to the platform on our way home, two officers stopped us to see our passports. We showed our passports with visa from DUBAI MOSCOW Consulate! Not enough, they asked us to enter a small room and checked EVERYTHING in our pockets and bags! One man even picked out and counted the Dollars and Dirhams of our wallets! Unbelievable officers (are these people guarding the metro station policemen?). I was so shocked seeing him counting my Dollars and Dirhams right before my eyes. To cut the story short, when we stepped out of that tiny room, I lost one 100 DOLLAR BILL. May God have mercy on their souls. Should this be how tourists get treated? Those two officers should have asked directly 100 Dollars from me instead of pilfering me at my face. Though it's just money I have earned from hard work in Dubai, I am in utter disbelief as to how can they bear the thought of eating something from that stolen money or, worse, provide to their families.Travellers, be extra careful when out and about in Saint Petersburg. Better leave foreign currency in your hotel / hostel safety boxes.I still liked Saint Petersburg despite of this."

The baroque architecture and artwork reflected in the palace is stunning. Do not dare to compare this to Versailles; the locals get very upset about this (or there was any influence altogether). We were there during summer so we were able to see the fountains. A summer visit is a must to see them and make sure to be there at noon to hear the music! Allow enough time to tour the gardens and grounds because they are beautiful. Peter was apparently quite the jokester and there are some fountains that spray passersby with water, unknowingly. Be warned! The only downside was not being allowed to take pictures inside. Otherwise, a definite must see in St. Petersburg! Make sure to take the hydrofoil there from the city. The ride is a sightseeing trip as well!"

The palace is open for groups and natives at certain times, so be sure to check and be there when you will be allowed entrance.

Painted a spectacularl yellow & white with gold domes. It is so large that it is hard to believe people actually lived here. When you see something gold it was real gold. This was designed and decorated more for men and the hunt. It is really hard to tell that as the opulence is still there. When you walk up the main staircase the stairs are really short and that is because the women's dresses weighed at least 40 pounds so they had to take small steps and couldn't lift there dresses and walk gracefully at the same time. The use of gold is so over whelming that you can see why there was an uprising when their people saw this wealth and huge homes that were built for the rich and they themselves were starving. The house is better done with a guide as you learn more about the lives of the people that lived here and the history. Mainly people from all over Europe were the main craftsmen. Our tour guides name was Julia and she was a walking encyclopedia. After the tour she suggested that we talk a walk in the grounds. At 11:30 am they turn on the main water cascade and fountains. The display is set to music just unbelievable. There are so many people lining the stairways and walkways to see the main event that it is hard to get near to take a pictures. If you wait until the end of the music you can get great pics without people being in your pic or at least not many. The grounds are extensive. You can walk down the canal toward the Baltic sea and go over each of the little bridges that look back towards the house. There are also side walkways that have more statues and fountains. The gardens are so beautifully done and maintained, you saw people cleaning and sweeping everywhere. It was high on my list of to do things and it did not disappoint at all."

Especially so as we visited the palace on a hot summer's day. No surprise that it was Peter the Great's summer residence.Of course, as a favourite tourist attraction, it is tremendously crowded, but compared to the other tourist hotspot in St Petersburg, the Hermitage, I never felt suffocated or trapped inside. This is probably because you have to move in groups, so you won't be allowed to roam on your own even if you came on your own. Also, the staff are very conscientious about ensuring one group doesn't stay in one room for too long, to keep the traffic moving along. A bit strict, but it really makes the experience better for everyone. Also made easier by the fact that you aren't allowed photos.Definitely worth a visit."

The fountains are visually stunning, but are all the more remarkable for the fact that they operate solely by means of natural hydraulic pressure--in other words, no pumps!

However, this meets, exceeds, and is over the top! The fountains and cascades were incredible. The playful \"sprays\" were also lots of fun. Would have liked to see an evening light show with music and, perhaps, fireworks. Book ahead to see the interior, which is more impressive than the exterior, which is saying something. Catherine's palace, however, if you are pressed for time is the ABSOLUTE must see near St. Petersburg. Come in September when the crowds are less."

If you have already visited the Versailles palace, it is not a breathtaking scene,although the unique fountains of palace make it worth the visit. Don't forget to walk under them, very tricky enjoyable game.There's also several people in the costume of king and queen so you can take photo for considerable price.As you walk into the garden your will reach a bay, from there you have nice shoot of Saintpetersburg, also you can take ferry to the city."

In my view, if you are visiting St Petersburg, this is the must-do tourist attraction. Obviously if you are museum buff, the Winter Palace is the place. But if you like visual stimulation this is the place. Take the hydrofoil boat to get there. Don't pay for a business class seat on the boat. It's a joke."

The Palace is replete with history and rich historical artifacts that belonged to the different royalties that once ruled Russia.

From the above balcony, near the Palace, you get a superb view of the Grand Cascade tumbling down among gilded Statues, and nicely planned terraces and gardens, -- and even a view of that expanse of the Baltic Sea. There are great photo ops from above and from below. There is so much gold, so much opulence, and so much grandeur that we were certainly awe struck. Unfortunately, we did not have time to see the inside the Palace.The Gardens were constructed to outdo the ones in Versailles. The Germans destroyed the place after World War II, but an extraordinary restoration has brought the place back to its original glory.There are hidden motion-activated water jets all over the property that can spray all of a sudden. Actually they are timed to go off at specific intervals. Our guide helped us to steer clear.There is a large number of tourists, but you do not feel crowded because everyone is dispersed all over those massive grounds. The walk in the park, through the gardens and around the beautiful statues was sheer delight.One of the most beautiful and unique places we have ever seen. Well worth a visit."

Try to avoid big tour groups of you can, small groups of under 3 get to jump the queue (as long as with a guide). Security does push the traffic through the palace quite quickly so you don't get too long to linger in any rooms. The walk through the gardens is nice, don't miss the \"surprise\" fountains.

Peterhof or Petergof (\"Peter's Court\") is famous for its palaces and gardens - laid out on the orders of Peter the Great and sometimes called the \"Russian Versailles.\" The area was extensively damaged during World War II during occupation by Nazi Germany. Reconstruction efforts began almost immediately following the war, and are still continuing. Nevertheless, what you see is breathtaking. Visitors arrive by hydrofoil from St Petersburg, in roughly 45 minutes. It is the fastest and most expensive way (about 700 Rubles) to get there. Show begins exactly at 11 am when all fountains start - all operating under gravity, no pumps.The gardens are well manicured and fountains are all around - small and large, some are gimmicky and will get you wet when you are not watching. A small canal from the gulf all the way to the steps of the palace is symbolic of Peter the Great's victory over Sweden, and then returning to his palace by boat. Fountains on both sides of the canal as well as the gilded statues and fountains at the steps of the Palace are a sight not to miss (and take pictures of.) Did not visit the palace - short on time and long lines. Then again, there is Catherine Palace and Hermitage to more than make up for it."

From the top of the bluff the gardens & fountains are a great sight, all classical golden statues, chequerboard floor & a channel opening out into the main fountain. Looking back up from the bottom, the Grand Cascade is an impressive vision with the Palace as backdrop. The Chessboard Cascade with its dragon motif certainly attracts the young visitor. Well worth a look also is the horizontal Monplaisir Palace & the garden & fountains of the Orangery. The Trick Fountain seems a bit gimmicky to me even if it was Peter's own idea. However it should be said that it does amuse (& cool down) the horde of people who gather round the gardens. What wasn't impressive was the inadequate & disgusting toilet facilities at the entrance, a row of portaloos (insufficient in number for the amount of visitors) with the nauseating smell of raw sewerage piling up."

You can easily enjoy a picnic by yourself up in the wooded area, or sitting overlooking the water (and, of gourse, see all the fountains, gardens, gazebos that everyone else is visiting). Just lovely. I spent nearly 4 hours just enjoying the grounds. And, yeah, Peter did water really well. Took the hydrofoil there and back (i didn't exit the \"lower grounds\" because I didn't want to have to pay to get back in just to take the hydrofoil back. So I must have missed something spectacular. But I certainly felt like I had an incredible time even without seeing the other grounds. The palace is included in the lower grounds. As others have said, food is ridiculously expensive here, so bring your own food and enjoy a little picnic on the grounds."

The craftsmanship and luxurious finish is totally outstanding with beautiful antique furnishings displayed throughout. This was certainly the highlight of our visit to St Petersburg.

There are no pumps to power the fountains, only gravity. If you do go to Peterhof, be sure to be there at 11AM as this is when the fountains are turned on while the St Petersburg Anthem is played. The best pictures of the fountains can be taken from the lower gardens with the palace in the background.So go to Peterhof, enjoy the palace tour, the gardens and views of the lake, and of course the fountains.

We just walked around and checked out the grounds and all the fountains. While some construction was going on, mostly everything was working and it was truly spectacular. Loved seeing all the fountains and the view of the coastline from the property. Some of the fountains were \"interactive\", where people would walk under them for a picture and they would suddenly power down, soaking the person, which I thought was hilarious. I did not take a tour, although I would suggest doing so, as I am sure there is much history behind the palace that would have made the experience even more enjoyable on a cultural and historical note."

That kind of ticket allows you to get in before the official opening hour, but I do not think you can get those if you buy your ticket yourself. But this is a must if you do not want to be stuck in a big crowd and it will allow you to see a lot more in a lot less time, allowing you to see more of the other wonders of St.Petersburg.Many call this place the \"Russian Versailles\". In fact if you already visited Versailles you will find that the comparison might be good about the gardens, but the Perterhof Palace cannot really be compared with the Versailles Palace. Peterhof is quite small in comparison. Yes it is still a pretty big place, but nothing to compare to Versailles.The gardens are really beautiful and the stories related to the different alleys are interesting. (Ask about the triky fountains!) And it is fun to see that the main fountains are still turn on manually (around 11h) just in front of the Palace.The Palace is interesting but you can see most of it within one hour.If you never saw Versailles I definitely recommend Peterhof. But if you did see Versailles I would still recommend to see Peterhof, but do not have to many expectation. Go for the history, not the Palace."

No signs, only the staff selling the tickets speak English, staff walking outside where you can ask questions about where to line up to buy tickets speak only Russian. When we finally figured out where to line up with sign language with one of the staff, another one came after 10 minutes and moved us with 15 other people to another line. Then the two staff members started yelling at each other. Once we were inside, it was very nice but because of all the tours and crowds and the guides wanting to keep you moving fast like a herd of sheep, we were not able to enjoy the inside as much as we would have liked. If you are visiting St/ Petersburg during White Nights, I would skip Peterhof and spend more time in Hermitage."

I went on this trip on the spur of the moment which probably wasn't the best idea; nobody speaks any English (why would they?) and signage is only in Russian so it was difficult to work out what to do. You get the hydrofoil from pier 4 opposite the Hermitage. Tickets are 750 and you can only buy 1 way. Keep your ticket to buy the return from kiosk 2, note you can only buy the return ticket when you are ready to go back -boats go from pier 3&5. Return is discounted to 550, they take credit cards and cash.When you get off the boat it is a very long walk up to the palace. You have to buy a ticket to the park at that point and it is only 500 roubles which is amazing value - keep the ticket as you need it to get out. - again cards and cash accepted. I later learnt that you can buy tickets (kacca) to get inside the palace at the same place.There is a free toilet stop just by the boat, clean but a long queue.The fountains are immediately in front of you and are spectacular, (there are a lot of signs warning of pickpockets so beware). There are also acres of gardens to either side which are equally impressive. There are buggies for hire which are 700 roubles and well worth it. There was also a small road train but it only went out into an undeveloped area and not around the main fountains.There is a cafe which served a strangely pleasant meal, it is quite rundown but the staff are friendly and food was tasty.Sadly I didn't get inside as I ran out of time, I would recommend a whole day there, take plenty of food and drink, hire a buggy and make sure you know the opening time for getting in the palace.A tip about the hydrofoil, the return journey was a bit frightening as the sea was very choppy, the boat dipped quite violently side to side, it seems this is normal so don't be alarmed!"

He needed access to the Baltic and wanted to create something better than Versailles of France. It was opened at his presence in August 1723. The most famous feature: The fountains. TheTsar himself contributed to the unique engineering system that supplies water to them, without a pump. The Great Cascade has 64 fountains and more than 250 statues and bas-reliefs. Peterhof (Russian Versailles) represents every style of the past and the special taste of the Russian monarchs. At the beginning it was called \"Upper Chambers\" and owed the name and the decor to Peter the Great. But the Baroque style transformation of the Palace was made by Bartolomeo Francesco Rastrelli during the reign of Peter's daughter, Empress Elizabeth in the 18th c. During WWII it was almost destroyed and it took decades for its restoration which continues even now. It's a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1990. The Museum complex covers 500 hectares. The Fountains of the Lower Park and the Upper Gardens have won the title \"Capital of the Fountains\" and \"One of seven wonders of Russia\". 11 o'clock every morning from May to September the show of the Fountains starts and the Marly bridge has the best panoramic view, if you are lucky to find some space quite early. Inside the buildings no photos are allowed, only in the endless gardens. Important notice: Returning to your coach is a difficult adventure as tens of coaches arrive non-stop and change parking places. Your best option is to remain close to your guide!"

But they are decorated nicely. Ahem.Peter died in 1725, and daughter Elizabeth picked up the ball from there. The structure didn't survive World War II well, but has been rebuilt since then. It's a top tourist attraction and deservedly so.By the way, photography is not allowed inside the building.

The destruction they did to this palace and other historical sites throughout St. Petersburg really shows the evil nature of the Nazi regime. I was completely blown away by how wonderful a restoration job the Russians did to remove and cover up the war damage. It is truly a wonder of the world that everyone should add to their bucketlist. I've seen it and would love to go back to see it again, that's how impressed I was.

We were pushed and I mean pushed through rooms without getting a chance to even read the spiel on each room. It doesnt help that the plagues are placed as you go out the door and not at the beginning of the room. The attendants are extremely rude and bossy and move you on in the seething crowd before you have had a good chance to look at the room,they even abuse you for talking too loud, as do the tour guides for other groups. Our group of 4 family members found this to be an unpleasant experience and not one we will ever do again. Seriously there are nicer things to see in St Petes where there are people that are less rude and accommodating. Don't waste your time and money during busy periods.

Flat shoes required. Even these have to be covered with slip on paper covers which tend to split so take an extra pair from the pile at the entrance to change into especially if you have large feet (eg mens size 10+).When you see how little of the palace was left after the Nazi's decimated it in WWII you cannot believe what is in front of you. the Russian people buried and hid artefacts and after the war came out in droves to rebuild and preserve. It is an amazing achievement all over again to see the palace rebuilt.The gardens are delightful with terraces of fountains reaching down to a canal at the end of which you can catch a hydrofoil across the Gulf of Finland to St Petersburg City centre. Normally takes about 30-45 minutes but doesn't run in bad weather. There is a gift shop in the palace at the end of the tour and plenty of rest rooms. cafes and in the gardens small stalls selling very reasonably priced ice creams.

You can walk all around the gardens if a nice day too. Again the Russians allow too many vendors here as in other historical sites that can be annoying but well worth a visit."

Seeing the outside of the palace, I would have loved to visit inside, but that was not on our schedule. There was quite a lot of walking with so many photo opportunities, it was quite a morning. A local Russian guide had many many stories to tell, knowing her history of Peterhof very well made it very interesting. We had nice weather so we really enjoyed the gardens and fountains. Speaking of fountains, this has to be the most fountains on an estate that I have ever seen or even heard of. They are really something to see, how beautiful everything was planned and the timing of when they are on and off is fascinating. Strolling the grounds, it takes one back to only imagine what it was like to have enjoyed all of that back in the day, and on a regular ordinary day, every day after day. Very relaxing, allow a good amount of time to appreciate the beauty and take time to smell the flowers!"

Incredibly windy, so be prepared for that. We ate a quick lunch in the little food tent out front, which was inefficient and overpriced. But who cares? Because these gardens are what we came for. And they did not disappoint. Acre after acre of beautifully cared for gardens and forests, wonderful old palaces and cottages, and of course fountains galore. I've never been anywhere like this in my life, and I'm sure I won't go anywhere else like it again. This was my kids' favorite spot because they could run in and out of tree lined walkways and play in the water fountains. And all the adults loved the sheer beauty, magnitude, and history of the place. Do make sure this is part of your itinerary when you come to St. Petersburg. Amazing."

This was a very rushed tour and as no photos where allowed inside the staff pushed the guides along quickly. Iv read people say they are rude but Im afraid its their way. We had a 10am entrance booked. Once inside and after visiting the restrooms and getting on the cover shoes we went around the palace. It only took us 30 mins at most. Such a shame, we were fortunate enough to be at the front but those in our group at the back where still in the last room whilst the guide was talking about the next. The fountains are turned on at 11am and we were there to view this grand scene. The walk around the grounds was with the guide so again no time to spend on our own. We paid \u00a358.25 each travelling by coach from a cruise ship. Total time out 5 hours. we would have loved to have had free time but this appears not to be allowed.

I\u2019ve read many reviews from TA contributors disappointed that they spent hours queuing to enter various sites in St Petersburg and ended up seeing very little once they got in due to time constraints. If you\u2019re visiting St Petersburg during summer, especially during the white nights, you must hire a private tour company that will obtain queue jump tickets. Our guide not only obtained queue jump tickets in advance; but she knew that staff at the Peter Hof and we were off and running in less than five minutes leaving the other tourists in the dust. If you want your memories of St Petersburg to consist of long queues and little else, then either organize your own tour or go on a group tour. If you want to see as much as possible in the least amount of time, then hire a private tour company. TA lists many for St Petersburg. They aren\u2019t cheap. Think of it as an investment, something you cannot afford not to do.After jumping the queue, we had a leisurely tour of the Peterhof. Although the Grand Palace is most remarkable, I was especially impressed with the grounds, they were perfect for strolling as it was a beautiful summer\u2019s day. One word of warning is that the hourly fountain display is not that impressive. If you have to wait more than ten minutes, skip it. I also recommend taking the hydrofoil from the Peterhof to the Winter Palace as it provides great views of the Gulf of Finland and St Petersburg."

The staff is really rude if you do not speak Russian; tourists are packed in the rooms of the small palace, where no one is allowed to take pictures, sit down or stay longer than 5 minutes. The gardens are really pretty, but you cannot go inside anywhere except the gardens without having to pay. Moreover, you can't leave the park because you will have to pay to get in again. I think that you will only like this place if you are a Russian with a lot of money to spend, besides that, don't even bother going to this place.

Keep in mind when you visit that the palace was burned down to the studs during WWII so almost nothing in here is authentic from the 17th century, and much of it dates from the Soviet era, so the Soviet pschye creeps in a bit from time to time.

They are definitely worth a day excursion from St Peter (we went by train and walked 20 min from the station). The park is lovely and the main foutains are gorgeous. But there is a BIG issue with organisation here. You can buy tickets for the park online but not for the palace. To visit the main palace you have to queue at specific hours (from noon to 3pm for us) to buy your ticket than queue again to enter the palace as they form groups of 30 people. If you want an audioguide, queue again. In total we waited over two hours. And of course the tickets quickly add up. Fortunately i was with a russian so we could get all this information but i pitty other tourist as almost none of this wierd organisation was explained and staff didnt seem too keen to help in english. Once inside, the palace is beautiful do to its very good preservation but you have to stay with your group and the guide went too fast through the rooms. The visited lasted maybe 30-40 min. Of course we didnt feel like visiting other buildings in the park after that (extra ticket each time). SoSo take your ticket for the lower park online, inform yourself as soon as you get there when is the ticket office for the palace open and plan your day depending on that. Take sandwiches as there is limited options for lunch."

Plan your visit on a sunny day to better grasp all the magnificence of Peterhof; The luxurious gardens, the fountains, time off for a lunch, the fountains, the breath taking landscape, the fountains - and yes, so many, fountains and in so many different shapes and fashions that you may be led to believe you have seen fountains for the rest of the year.One can reach Peterhof either by speed boat, or by public transport; Eventually both ways have their advantages, and being among russians in a public transport and different landscape on the way, was part of the spirit, thus I really enjoyed it.If going by public transport you want to reach the Avtovo metro station; When there spare some time to appreciate the beauty of this metro station where the Station Hall is stunningly beautiful. Once on the street there are vans departing every two minutes to Peterhof, thus no hassle at all. A public regular bus line also runs and costs pretty much the same. At Peterhof there is a 10 usd cost to enter the gardens, then additional cost for each attraction. Better off visiting on a bright sunny day, plenty of mood to appreciate the gardens, courtyards and the many, many fountains. Spare a whole day for this attraction."

There are no maps or brochures at Peterhof (only a few signposts) and the ticket booths and signs at the entrances to the various buildings are in Russian only. We stood in line for almost an hour at the palace only to find out we had not purchased the correct combo ticket, even though our ticket looked exactly the same as all the other tickets, and we had to come back later in the day. The Peterhof website English page explains the various ticket combos with prices, and maps of Peterhof also can be downloaded from the Internet (but not the Peterhof website). We could have saved ourselves some frustration and time by doing more research first. A guidebook with maps would be useful."

The hydrofoil leaves from the quay right behind The Hermitage. The trip takes just over 30 minutes and you arrive just a very short distance from the entrance to the Park. Get there before 11.00 am in order to see the magnificent fountains in front of the palace entering service. A walk in the park is a delight. There are several fountains to admire and enjoy. Peterhof is not an inexpensive destination, taking into account the cost of the hydrofoil and the separate entrance fees for the park, the palace and the other buildings there. You don't need to see and do everything but don't miss Mon Plaisir. So, read your guide book and decide in advance on exactly what you want to see and do there. You are very unlikely to be disappointed."

However, we went there for the fountains.We were pleasantly surprised by the amount of exhibits in the palace. Very similar to the Catherine Palace with double the amount of materials. Lots of paintings and furniture from neighbouring China too. Grand halls were amazing!The highlight has to be the fountains! Originally there were 300 of them, today 150 remain. We had lots of fun going through each one of them and followed the flow to the Gulf of Finland. The tricky fountain was especially fun for kids. Flowers were blooming and apparently squirrels were residents of the garden too."

Not too bad taking the metro to Avtovo then Bus 200 or 210 or metro to Baltiyskaya and then Bus 404. Buses cost around 55 Rubles. Hotel organized tours to Peterhof cost 3,000 Rubles. In the summer, the hydrofoil is supposed to be easy and fun, although the cost is about 10 times that of the bus. Don't miss the Peterhof, worth a morning or afternoon of your time."

When the palace became the center of attention for Tsar Peter, the Tsar himself presented his visions for the grounds and palace to the architects. The palace was built in \"Petrine Baroque\" style and due to Peter\u2019s enthusiasm, a massive amount of work in the landscaping and expansion was carried out during the years 1714-1725.The work resumed during the years 1745-1755 by architect Francesco Bartolomeo Rastrelli, on behalf of Empress Elizabeth (Peter\u2019s daughter), on the model of Versailles - the so-called mature Baroque style. The view of the facade of the Grand Palace, especially from Lower Park, is impressive but the palace itself is quite narrow and not as big as it looks. One of the most spectacular interiors of the palace is the Grand Staircase, which impresses with its gilded wood carvings. The most magnificent interior of the palace is the Ballroom; a sea of lights reflects the endless mirrors and gilded wood carvings. The most famous of all rooms - The Chesma Hull, bears its name is in memory of the battle Chesmen of 25-26 June, 1770 in the Aegean Sea. In this battle the Russian fleet achieved a decisive victory in the Russian-Turkish war of 1768-1774. Catherine II, who received the news of the destruction of the Turkish fleet, ordered a series of paintings by the German artist Jacob Philipp Hackert. Visitors should also pay attention to the Chinese Cabinets and Picture Hall."

Free toilets in the grounds were very clean, and plenty of benches dotted around the gardens and fountains provided a much-needed rest when wandering the grounds.The Palace itself is a real pleasure to visit, even after the opulence of the Winter Palace. Our one complaint would be that no photography of any kind was allowed inside, despite the 550 ruble entrance fee for adults.Top tips: Flash your student card for a discount on entry - 300 rubles instead of 550.Do a little research and take the local minibus to the site. We got the metro to Avtovo, crossed over to the other side of the road, and hopped on one of the minibuses with a 'Peterhof' sign in the windscreen. The journey lasted around 30 minutes and cost 55 rubles each - really easy to find the right bus stop for the journey back, too."

OK, it was not cheap, but it was well worth it. We approached by walking from the town side along a very long drive past one or two fountains to the main house. It appears to be massive, but in fact is a long thin building, mainly one, but on occasions two smaller rooms thick. However, the State Rooms are magnificent. There is an abundance of gilt and mirrors with of course chandeliers. The rooms were well furnished. The decor is very lavish and it was a joy to visit. What really wanted to see was the view of the house from the other side - ie as if approaching from the Gulf of Finland. The Grand Cascade is modeled on the one built for Louis XIV at Ch\u00e5teau Marly. It is spectacular, all those fountains with the house behind. The view from the House's terrace is also good. I enjoyed walking round the grounds with smaller but very creative fountains, formal French gardens and of course smaller palaces. My only regret is that we dis not have more time. We left St Petersburg at 1.30pm and returned at 7pm. It deserves a full day. and then you won't see it all. Although it was early October, the fountains were all working - the highest has a jet of 20 metres and none is operated by a pump!"

What better way to do it than drive down to Peterhof Great Palace in Peterhof about 30 minutes drive south of the city. This is by far the most entertaining of all the attractions on offer and steeped in tons of history. In particular Peter the Great and Katherine the Great. This is a great rival to the Palace of Versailles in Paris and the Schoebrun in Austria. I think this one outdoes them both with the spectacular fountain displays. You would have no chance of smuggling anything in to the place. Everyone is treated as a potential terrorist with intentions of stealing Russias Crown Jewel collection. All the guards are middle aged women (affectionately known as ''The dragons'') and there is not a smile among the lot of them. You can't get a heavy coat or an umbrella past the dragons. It was the summer holiday resort for the royal families right through to the Bolshevik Revolution. The contents of the palace are spectacular and the rooms are dripping in gilt. The best attraction though is the beautiful gardens and the spectacular golden fountains. There is a cost in getting there but it is worth it. Don't even attempt it without a knowledgeable guide. It is built on the Baltic Sea with distant views back to the city. This is by far the best attraction in SP and it would be a pity to go all that way and miss it."

As Americans would say, 'It's awesome.' Fantastic attention to detail. It's one of the few attractions I've been too around the world where I sensed a really positive vibe and community spirit from all the visitors. Lots of Russians visit as well as foreign tourists. It's so impressive everyone walks around in awe. You can quite easily spend days here. There are queues to many of the attractions within, and I did feel like you pay to get in and then you pay again and again to see discrete areas within the grounds and main complex. But it will have cost 100s of millions to restore and someone has to pay for it. So it falls on the tourist, which is fair enough. I think locals pay less than foreigners.The grounds are as impressive as the palace. A tour through the water-system that drives all the fountains is fun and fascinating. The idea that little children, in centuries past, went up the 22 kilometres of pipes to clean them is a scary thought but apparently true, according to our guide. English is spoken but patchy. The grounds are wonderful to walk through. Of course opulence on a grand scale. Some of the summer houses by the sea are fun - with features that in their day would have been as cool as an iPad is to us today. Unfortunately we could not take photos inside those caringly restored buildings, so none to share. If you are staying in St. Petersburg I would recommend taking the hydrofoil out to Peterhof. It's a quick journey across open water, and it adds to the drama of the day. If you are not able to walk long distances, the only downside with the hydrofoil is, there's a bit of walk from the dock (albeit a very impressive walk up a canal with fountains) to the main palace. A coach or taxi might park you closer to the main palace in that sense."

One would definitely be impressed looking out from the front landing of the Palace proper the long stretch of gardens and fountains dissected by a sea channel right in the middle all the way to the ocean front. The view was breathtaking and indeed fit for a King. We walked along the sea channel all the way to the coast and the view of the Palace from the other end was equally impressive. This part of the compound I believe is called the lower garden and there were plenty of walkways in the park on the two side of the channel for one to explore if you have got your walking shoes. The Samson fountain positioned between the Palace and the Sea Channel shoots a jet of water sky high and story was told that Samson pulling apart the jaws of a lion represents Russia's victory over Sweden in a bygone era. One interesting thing about the fountains in the Palace is I was told they operate without pumps, using merely elevation difference to create pressure to drive the water. The Palace itself is a rather narrow strip of building and unfortunately photography was not allowed inside. There is the lavishly gilded grand ballroom with ample glittering chandeliers on the wall, the Throne Room that houses only one elevated red chair probably for the Emperor, an elegant white Dining Room, a hall that was adorned with many large paintings of the Battle of Chesma - a war between Russia and Turkey (our guide told us that since the painter had no experience of war at sea, Catherine II arrange for the explosion of a frigate so he can get some idea as to how to paint) and a stateroom that hung hundreds of canvas portraits of women of difference ages, appearances and attires ( said to be drawn with the same model). One interesting fact about this palace is the floors are superbly finished and patterned parquet floors with different designs for different areas - can imagine how the prince and princess glided when they waltzed in the Ball Room. We did not have the time to tour the upper garden but from a distance, it was far less spectacular than the lower one. This Palace being dubbed the Russian Versaille is a must go place when you visit St. Petersburg."

The first view of the palace, from along a canal literally takes your breath away. The gardens and house have been lovingly restored and maintained (after the destruction of 1943). The fountains, golden statues and achingly beautiful palace must not be missed.Top Tip 1 - Take a pair of comfortable shoes, you will need them.Top Tip 2 - Take plenty of money, if you want to visit any of the other exhibits, the main entrance only grants you access to the gardens.Top Tip 3 - Obtain a plan of the gardens (and look out for the red squirrels)"

(As with the other palaces in the region, all of the interior furnishings were moved to Siberia for safekeeping at the beginning of the War, and returned afterwards.) However, the gardens, with literally hundreds of fountains of varying degrees of intricacy and size, are truly amazing. It seems that flowering plants are constantly installed seasonally and everything is manicured to a T. There is even an open aviary with exotic birds. believe I read in one of Rick Steves's books that one need not travel to both the Catherine Palace and also Peterhof (which are in opposite directions from St. Pete), but I disagree.

In between the trees we had glimpses of grand buildings and palaces. Peterhof is the huge summer estate of Peter the Great. It is set in a park that features numerous palaces, summer houses and pavillions. Peter the Great visited Versailles in 1717, which inspired him to build a palace \"befitting to the very highest of monarchs.\" The occupying forces of the German army destroyed most of Peterhof during WW II. The palace was partially exploded and left to burn. Restoration work began almost immediately after the end of the war and continues to this day. Peterhof has been so heavily restored that most of it looks virtually brand-new. Our guide has the attitude that the palace is \"even better than it was!\" Most Russians feel this way about their restored heritage. They lost so much, how can they feel otherwise? For me, the shiny gold leaf and brightly painted walls made the palace look too much like a movie set. I did get to see some furniture and porcelains that were \"of the period.\""

It took an hour and a half to get out there and the same back. That does not seem to be long but when you add three hours or more to adequately see the palace and stroll about in the gardens you have basically spent the whole day out there. You really have to decide whether you want to sacrifice a day of your trip to one sight where there is so much to see in St Petersburg itself. The Palace itself is quite beautiful, and was luckily saved from the Nazis by the Red Army, which seemed to gut the place in their retreat to save the interiors and furniture. The interior is much like other European Palaces that Peter the Great would have sought to emulate, with gaudy and ornate gilting and cornicing everywhere. There is a lovely chinese lacquer board room and Peter the Great's personal study is fantastic (though its in such amazing condition it seems hard to believe its all original). The place is adorned with paintings of the Russian fleet (given its importance to St Petersburg) and portraits of the Romanovs. The gardens are also very nice to visit and one can walk down to the Baltic and see the city in the distance, its quite beautiful.As stated before however, you'd want to think about it. You would really have to have a thing for Palaces!!"

The gardens are just lovely , the fountains knock Chatsworth House for six , not a patch on these at The Peterhof . We strolled down the steps imagining days gone by ,. We stood at the end of the garden and looked out to the sparkling sea . Our heads full of the history and knowledge conveyed to by our very friendly knowledgable guide Vera (who was with us throughout our days in St Petersburg ) .

You must go with a tour from what I saw, and happily, we did, as otherwise there is no one who is going to help you, no signs you will be able to read. From a people-flow perspective, it's a nightmare - unless you come with a group with a Russian guide - from what I saw, that is a must, as you will spend so much time trying to figure things out, and your frustration will color your experience. The gardens are stunning! Be sure to get there for the ceremony when they are turned on in the morning at 11am with Prokofiev music booming from the speakers, quite lovely. You can't take any photos inside the palace, which was a great disappointment - NO photos, or one of the Russian women room guards will be all over you! Another warning is if you are physically handicapped, as a member of my family is, ohhhhh, you're in for a bad time! The single lift is on the opposite end of where you need to be, no one is going to tell you where it is even though you obviously need it, it's just not pleasant!

It truly is the Versailles of Russia. Lovely gold leaf and restoration. But no pictures inside, and if you touch some of the ropes by accident, an alarm goes off, and the Russian museum ladies are watching like a hawk - it feels uncomfortable to be watched like that - it was less obtrusive at other sites. Only 500 rubles to get in (about $15 Cdn). The good thing with Viking was getting in before it opened, with no crowds. Apparently it's crazy in the summer. We were there Sept. 1 (first day of school) and it was cloudy. Much less crowded than usual, the guide said. In the books in the tourist shop there were other rooms we didn't see.

Went to join the queue - which after standing in the pouring rain for one hour, turned out to be the queue for groups. Individuals need to go around the palace, pay their entrance to the park (in the pouring rain) and go queue again at the back of the palace in order to get in. Stood there for another our to an hour and a half, finally got in, bought tickets to visit the palace, followed the crowd to a cloakroom, and were subsequently crushed against the entrance doors as they would only let members of groups in (the members of which were scattered all over the cloakroom). Angry staff, pissed off visitors answering in other languages, and finally ... we got past the entrance doors. From the onwards, it was a pleasure to the eye. Beautiful palace! By the time we ended the visit it had even stopped raining and we were able to walk through the park for a while, before heading towards St-Petersburg again."

The Gardens lead from Palace down to the shore of the Gulf of Finland consisting mainly of formal wooded areas, with the spectacular fountains, smaller museums (set in Palace outbuilding) and more formal gardened areas. The centre of the gardens are the fountains and water features that lead from the front of the palace which have been beautifully restored, particularly with the Palace as a backdrop. The Gardens are well worth a visit and although the entrance fee is a little expensive, it is a enjoyable 2-3 hours plus."

All European palaces including Versailles pale against Peter the Great`s residence including the Grand Palace and its park with fountains. It is better to go there by boat (from Hermitage pier or Admiralty pier) and it will take you only 40 min. Buy tickets to both ends to avoid staying in the queue in Peterhof. You will enter through the Lower Garden and will be able to see all the beauty of the Grand Palace and cascade of fountains in front of it. So don`t rush into the sightseeing, I would recommend to take an excursion around the park by small electric mobile (similar to golf cars). You can order and take it at the first souvenir stand. It is a 40 min excursion with audio guide so you will be able to see actually everything and then make your own plan how the best to see and explore the place. It is huge and you may spend the whole day wondering around. Then go to the Grand Palace`s tickets office for a ticket (note that it is open only for 2 hours in the morning and 2 hours in the afternoon) to see the palace. I will recommend you to see also the Monpleisir Palace. It is small but cute. The tickets are sold near the entrance. It is better to go at the day when the weather is nice and not raining (not possible) or not pouring as some museums and palaces are closed in rainy weather. You can\u2019t enter museum in wet shoes. And also before middle of October (I think) as afterwards the fountains are not working."

They are not just an amazing architectural delight but an unbelievable engineering feat. The fountains, which numbers in the dozens, are all gravity fed from springs in the mountains. The water strategically flows from the higher fountains through a system of pipes that feed each fountain until they empty into the river. The fountains range from large majestic to whimsical \"tree\" fountains that trap you when you sit on a bench under the \"tree\", to fountains hid in benches that spray you as you unsuspectingly sit on the bench. The palace itself is nice though far from the opulence of a Versailles in Paris. Of the many palaces I have visited, this is a personal favorite because of the beauty of the grounds. It is an excellent shore excursion if you arrive by cruise ship in St. Petersburg. If you have to choose between Catherine's palace or Peterhof, pick Peterhof."

Peterhof Palace is a perfect example of this. We visited with a Viking River Cruise on a Sunday. This excursion costs us approx. $105.00 each. We arrived at 8 am and waited about 30 minutes to be let in. We were told that tour groups had special early entry before the masses arrived. We had earphones and our English speaking Russian guide led us through Peterhof flawlessly. Having read the three star reviews I would say this is the best way to visit. I would not recommend doing this on your own, since others had so much trouble with entrance fees, museum employees, and the crowds. Peterhof is breathtaking, you must see the palace and be lead by a guide. Our group moved along easily with an adequate explanation of each room. It is true that the women guards take their jobs very seriously. They did not crack a smile and don't even think about getting your camera out! We purchased a book in the gift shop that fully explains the palace and pictures every aspect of the museum with images you could not capture with your camera anyway. The gift shop prices were reasonable. I purchased an amber bracelet which will always have a special meaning for me, along with some other souvenirs.We then had a couple of hours in the gardens on our own. The fountains are an engineering marvel and the gardens are beautiful. At 11am the main cascading fountain begins to go off set to music and builds to a crescendo. Don't miss this sight. There are over 100 unique fountains and statues throughout the grounds. By the time we left around 1:00 the crowds were dense and we were thankful we arrived early and our visit was perfect.Be informed, you are not allowed to enter with backpacks and bottled water must be kept out of sight. You will slip booties on over your shoes when you enter to protect the wonderful flooring. Do not have your cameras visible. Use the restrooms when you are inside the building. The outdoor facilities are scarce and you have to pay. As with any foreign country, be respectful of the people, their treasures and their customs.In a nutshell, do the palace and gardens! Especially if this will be your only opportunity. Don't expect friendly Russian natives. The only smiling happy Russians we dealt with on our entire trip to Russia with were ones that were dependent on our tourist dollars. And if you can, go with a tour group to get the full benefit of this marvelous palace."

The lower garden, being the main attraction of the palace, requires entry fee whereas the upper garden is free of cost to visit. You should plan to spent a day in the place.It is little far from the St. Petersburg city, so you need to take a taxi, or ride metro. Metro ride will save a lot in terms of money. Depending on your location, you might need to change the train once or more, and then get a bus/minivan from the Novyi station. The ride is seamless, and you shouldn't have any issue reaching the palace. However, the most attractive choice would be the cruise from St. Petersburg which will take you directly to the lower garden of Peterhof, little costly option though.In the upper garden, there are couple of fountains on the canvas of the palace building. The garden is decorated with many trees and sculptures. Once you pass through the upper garden, you will have the gate to lower garden. It starts with a big stair case on both sides of the palace with the main fountain in between. You can take the stairs to get down in the garden which extends till the shore of Baltic sea.Overall the place is breathtaking, with the mixture of history, art and natural beauty. For us, it was the best part of our St. Petersburg tour."

Getting to and from Peterhof can be slightly difficult when going the cheap route, but it's worth it considering how expensive it can be after paying for both entrance to the Lower Gardens and the palace itself. Take the red line to Baltiskaya Station for 28ru and then bus K404 for 55ru which stops at the entrance of the Upper Gardens. Don't forget your student ID as the prices vary greatly for students and adults. The Lower Gardens cost either 250ru for students or 500ru full price, and the Grand Palace is either 300ru for students or 550ru full price. Bring water as it can cost about 80ru for just 0,5l and you will get thirsty walking around especially on a hot day. As for the gardens and palace itself they are both extremely worth the trip. Your breath will be taken away by another example of European monarchical opulance. It's easy to spend an entire day here and with varying times for Russian and foreign visitors to enter the palace you should be very flexible in your schedule. But it is yet another must do while visiting St. Petersburg!"

Unforunately, I think every other tourist in St. Petersburg had the same destination in mind. Biggest crowds of any of St. Petersburg's attractions yet. We chose not to tour the palace and came just for the gardens and they were simply amazing. One ceases to wonder why the Russian people rebelled when you see how much gold was used. The fountains are inventive and sometimes quite silly and all over the top in opulence. We grabbed a quick bite at the Orangerie in the gardens and then went back to the city on the hydrofoil."

Be aware, though, if the wind gets up in the day, they can cancel sailings.We paid to enter the gardens/grounds of the palace and to enter the actual palace. The palace was very beautiful and as it's Rocco style, very ornate. We started our tour alright but as the tour groups caught up with us, it became unbearable and I couldn't wait to get out. Thank you to the tour groups that consider others and use head phones and just seem to glide through, unlike the other groups that create such noise pollution! The palace watchdogs kept everyone moving through the 'Chinese' decorated climate controlled rooms but were OK otherwise. Once we had completed the tour of the palace we knew there were other options, ie the grotto, but do you think we could find information or help to buy tickets? NO! So, we decided to walk around the gardens and fountains and try to chill out after our experience. Husband decided to treat himself to an ice cream and we couldn't believe when the shop assistant came around to the freezer and unlocked it, picked out the wrapped ice cream he wanted and re locked the freezer. We have a lot to learn about life here:-)"

The Grand Palace and beautiful fountains are the main attractions. There are several other smaller palaces dotted throughout the estate that can be visited, but if your time is limited, it would be best for first-time visitors to focus on the Grand Palace, fountains, and immediate surrounding gardens. Taking the hydrofoil to Peterhof from near the Hermitage is the best way to get there and taking it back to the city is easy enough from Peterhof. Be aware that on busy days, you might not be able to get the first hydrofoil available."

You pay up to 3 times what the locals pay; you are charged to take photos in museums; audioguides comes at a premium price; combined attraction tickets are a rarity and prices are top dollar. Even the toilets are not free. Peterhof delivers in each and every one of these categories. You pay to get into the park; you pay to re-enter the park if you want to visit the town; you pay to enter each site on the estate; you pay to walk behind the fountains to visit the grotto. If it's any consolation, the toilets are free, but since you need to shell out for the hydrofoil, this will provide scant compensation. Worst of all, most of it is fake. Or, to be precise, it was reduced to a ruin by bombing during the war (allegedly by the Russians, themselves) so what you see inside and out is a recreation, largely from the soviet years. So, in effect, an imperial theme park.We spent 3 hours there and got more entertainment out of watching the vain princesses preening themselves for incessant photographs than entering any particular building. We were booked on the 6pm return sailing but begged to be allowed back on the 3pm. After some ritual humiliation and suffering the pretence that we might be turned away, we were given our wish and we were delighted to depart this ghastly waste of time and money. Novgorod too was rebuilt after the war, but we bitterly regretted not going there instead to see the collection of icons and open air museum. It couldn't have been less disappointing."

HINT: Leave yourself plenty of time to view the gardens, they are well worth the time. When you head back up to the main palace, you will find the cascading steps and fountains breathtaking. There are great photo opportunities both from the bottom of the fountain and from atop the steps looking down over the reflecting pool. Gorgeous place.

As with all travel in Russia in summer--layer clothing , comfy shoes and a small water bottle in your purse or pocket is a good idea (cannot take in large bags).

A piece of advice -the earlier you come, the better there will be fewer visitors. There are usually no queues at the entrance, but might be a queue to the palace. My recommendation is just don't go there-there are many palaces in Petersburg, but the park is unique.One more thing-there are just a ciuple of cafes inside the park-I would rather avoid those, the menu , the service and the prices don't match the expectations. Have your meals at Brynza, a nice fast food cafe at the entrance.Have a nice trip)"

However, the spectacular fountains (we arrived just as they were being turned on, at 11am, to music) can be argued to be more awe-enspiring than those at Versailles. The gilding, the opulence, this is the Tsar's Russia at its best. Leave time to wander through the park, the gardens, and do not miss the photo gallery with pictures of damage during WWII. How this palace was rebuilt in so short a time is a miracle in itself."

Peterhof Palace can be conveniently reached by hydrofoils that depart from several places in St. Petersburg (for example on riverside next to Winter Palace). The park is huge and it takes some time to walk through it and see all the different fountains. Right in front of the palace are the most spectacular fountains. To get into the palace, another ticket has to be purchased. This might be confusing since they have different hours for Russians and international visitors; going there with a guided group or someone speaking Russian might be a good idea. Together with the State Hermitage museum my favorite place to go in St. Petersburg region."

Having been there, as well as palaces all over the world, this isn't as good. It seems a bit garrish at times, with basically gold-leafed statues and displays.We liked the gardens and fountains the best, and I think the fountains came on at 11 am. (Be sure to get there early to get a good spot!) However, the music that came on at that time was rather blaring, and softer music would have made it more classic, but it still was very good display. It took only about 3-4 minutes for the fountains to come on full-blast.The gardens were great and we enjoyed wandering around it.Note: They do not permit photography inside the palace - kinda annoying and irritating, and no good logical reason for it.You can finish it within 2 hours, but should allow 2-3 hours to leisurely walk and enjoy."

I am not a fan of such trips, but it seemed an easy way to visit the gardens. However, to my horror, it did not include the upper garden or the palace! I felt cheated. To have come this far and then only able to see part of it was truly annoying. We had no time to get tickets for the upper gardens or palace either. It appears that tourists are herded into the lower gardens and heaven help you if you want to see all of it. The lower gardens, however, are truly magnificent. They are well worth a visit. We didn't even get enough time to explore them properly! The 'surprise' fountains are fun and must be unique. Obviously planned by someone with a sense of humour! The planting of the garden was good too and we loved the fountain with the gold turtles. I don't know how visitors can actually see all of this garden and palace as it does appear to be so difficult with the ticketing system and the sheer number of people wanting to visit. We went on a Thursday and the queues for the additional tickets were pretty long. It probably needs to do some late nights to spread the visiting hours a bit. Why turn on the fountains at 11am? A bit late. Having said all of this, visitors really must go! This and the whole of the Tzar's Village really epitomise the Russian Emperors' lifestyle and opulence."

Not only do you see some of the magnificence of the Palace style but the gardens add to that, especially the magnificent fountains. it was fascinating to hear that there are no pumps supplying the water which is from higher ground elsewhere. Great to see the kids enjoying the random water jets, we were told that the jets are controlled by a man sitting in a little green shed hidden in the trees nearby.

They make a real event of the switch on with the jets of water being switched on one at a time until they finally reach a crescendo. It was busy though so to get a good spot you will need to be there a few minutes before. I would recommend watching from the top of the steps outside the palace to get a great panoramic view.I wasn't so impressed with the palace itself as the tour is very rushed with angry looking women moving you on if you dare to dawdle.

            "review": "Ridiculous organisation of a beautiful sight. I should start with the fact that the gardens and fountains are amazing! Especially the fountains we will remember for life! But let me do this chronologically. I am not a big fan of guided excursions, in fact in 99 out of 100 times I will prefer to organise it by myself and look around at my own pace. This is where we differ from the whatever body runs this amazing palace. They have done everything so that travelers outside packed mindless groups (no offence to fellow travelers themselves) should feel uncomfortable. We decided to go by public transport, option that is quite cheap (10 times) compared to the hydrofoil. We took the so called marshrutka from Avtovo metro station. This is not really hard to do, even you do not have a clue about cyrilic alphabet, just ask \"Peterhof\" and everyone will point you to the small minibuses (look for number K424A). The marshrutka stop just in front of the entrance of the upper gardens, which are beautiful but are no match to the lower. I have bought online ticket for the lower gardens (you have to enter the lower gardens to enter the palace) but it proved useless as there were quite many boots selling tickets and no hassle at all. With online ticket one still has to pass through the boots. Then you enter the lower park gardens. At 11 am they start the fountains with music intro. Quite grandeur to watch but still I felt not that thrilled. Lower park is a must see. There are different fountains scattered around the grounds and one could wander for hours. My suggestion - visit as many fountains as you can. I personally liked the Pyramid one. It would have been useful to have a map of the grounds, but they only sell booklets with map for 150 rubles. Consider wandering on your own. Monplaisir palace is nice but pointless to enter. With large open french windows one could see everything from outside. The setting at which it is built was the real key point for me (at the shore). Every small cottage, museum and palace has an entry tickets of its own. That is a pretty good strategy to stop me visiting those \"attractions\". If they had a all-in-one ticket, I would have probably went for it and they would have earned more money, but who could understand Russian intentions.Grand Palace - here is where the real pain starts. There are two ticket boots inside the east wing of the palace where they sell the tickets, but those boots are open from 12 to 14 and from 16 to 15 (not so sure about how accurate is the time for slot this second session). They actually sell a maximum of 600 tickets a day. The boot is well sign posted, but the opening times table is immensely confusing. If you do not speak Russian you are lost. The queue for tickets is going quite fast but it is advisable if there is more than one person in you group to assign someone to the queue at the entrance (100 m away). This way you will save some time. At around 12:45 after only 45 min of work they closed the boots without any explanation. For an hour there was no single piece of clue when they will resume operations. Some of the Russians suggested that they will start selling after the queue at the palace entrance disperse, but the thing is that the two queues were interlinked and the people waiting at the palace were those assigned to skip the second queue. It looked as a deadlock. I was totally shocked to witness the mentality of Russian tourists who have enormous patience while treated as cattle. Anyway, finally they opened and the most patient were granted access. For foreigners there is another boot inside the palace, but it opens at 14:30. How you get to this boot inside, when you could enter the palace only with a ticket remains a mystery to me. The palace is beautiful but no match to Palace of Catherine in Tsarskoe selo. Once inside the palace you will be assigned to a group for a guided tour. I strongly advise you to return with the hydrofoil as it is a very pleasant ride. Price is around 650 rubles per person one way. With this trip you will have a chance to view the beautiful architecture of SP from the Neva river, but it is not a substitute for a boat ride under the bridges. All in all a must see but the organisation contributes to the low score."

And I also got to see the Winter Palace, so I guess I don't feel too disappointed. It saved us 200 rubles. But to anyone going, if you don't have a palace ticket and find yourself in the lower gardens DO NOT LEAVE. There is somewhere to get a ticket for the palace. You just have to find it."

He and his architects succeeded partially so I would not quite compare it the its French model.But no doubt, it deserves a visit.Most important is to make clear what is going on there.You can arrive by hydrofoil.One station is behind the Hermitage and is 200 rubels more expensive than the station across the street ! The same boat the same time.You can choose visiting only the gardens or also the Palace.Two separate entrance fees.If you choose only the estate(gardens) than I suggest to buy only a one way ticket with the hydrofoil. The reason is that if you want to exit the lower gardens to visit more on the other side , you have to leave the gates and you will not be able to return to the boat unless you purchase again a new entrance ticket just to get to the shore.If you buy only one way ticket then you can leave the lower gardens and actually see more gardens and fountains.From there you can return by bus. It was frustrating because we understood all this only after we bought the two way tickets for the boat.On the other hand you can travel there by bus and return by bus or bout.The travel by this hydrofoil is not that exiting as it seems because the rout on the water takes you nearby industrial zone.But the gulf itself is nice.Back to the gardens: there are no maps in the gardens so is better if you know beforehand what is there.Entrance to other sites situated in the garden are also for a fee(extra) For example we visited the Hermitage (a relatively small pavilion situated on the far right side of the gardens.) It was interesting for the way the food arrived on the table of the royalty.It was forbidden to take pictures !Some of the big fountains are situated outside the lower gardens like the Neptune fountain or the Pyramid fountain.We spent about three hours without the palace and the upper gardens.The hydro comes and goes each half hour.Near the shores the local Russians open tables for pick-nick.Worth visiting and then comparing it to Versailles !"

I was in awe at the ceilings and rooms in the Hermitage and have recently just been to Versailles. I have to say, seriously disappointed. First, we went by hydrofoil, nice enough and worth doing to avoid the bus but upon arriving, you then have to pay to enter the lower gardens, which truth be told, is more or less like Central or Hyde park. You then have to pay to get into the palace, which is SWAMPED with tours - there was only three of us and we couldn't even move forward or backwards we were sandwiched between back to back groups, packed into tiny roped-in corridors, literally on top of each other.The rooms themselves are beautiful and breath-taking but you have no time to actually look at anything because you are literally being swamped by the next group behind you. On top of that, you have access to maybe 1/8th of the palace... the whole 'visit' took about 30 minutes and only included a small wing of the palace, unlike the hermitage, which you could spend days wandering through.Afterwards you are ushered through visitor shops, more shops and one last shop, then outside. Despite all this, I am generally a glass half full traveler so figured I could explore the upper gardens before catching the hydrofoil back. Surprise! Your entry ticket is only good once so to leave the fenced in area to visit the other gardens, which are public and free, you then have to pay AGAIN to get back in, just to walk through the lower gardens to get to the boat. All in all, we spent nearly $200 for 3 people and about 3 of our 4 hours there either in queue or in transit. I would definitely pass on this if you are short on time - way better things to see in St. Petersburg and not worth the trip unless you are just looking for something extra to do."

Our first view was from water level up a hill along a divided pathway between wooded areas which if you had time you could wander down pathways beneath the trees. Along the main walk going uphill there were periodic small fountains leading to a bigger one at the bottom of a more serious hill upon which the palace was situated. We did not have an inside the palace tour, so I can't help with that. Off to the side at the bottom of the palace hill were more fountains and flowers among the forest of trees that surrounds the palace. This certainly a place where a lot more time than our couple of hours could be spent. Obviously at least a half day is needed with an inside tour. The hydrofoil is definitely the way to go. The outdoors has Versailles beaten and the engineering of the fountains is a big reason for that. Indoors, you'll just have to try both and make up your own mind."

In fact, ferries go between the dock at the palace and Finland for day trippers. Known for its extensive fountains outdoors which come on at 11 each morning, it's hard to visit this venue without being surrounded by crowds. However, that said, the interiors are magnificent and well worth the trip. We didn't have enough time to do the interior and both the front and back gardens - leave yourself at least 3.5 hours - more if you like to relax and take in the views outdoors. Also, pack comfortable walking shoes. Very picturesque and historic."

It is one of the most beautiful parks, buildings and gardens I had ever seen. It's a little pricey, and you have to pay for every different place you visit. I'd like one price for everything. I also could not exit the lower grounds to get to the other upper without paying for another ticket to get back in. I had to get back in because my boat left from the lower grounds. I don't think I misunderstood this silliness because I speak Russian and asked security. So that needs to be fixed--like a stamp on one's hand? The \"Rocket\" ships are the best way to go. Catch them from the dock in front of St. Isaac's Cathedral. The fountains were amazing and I caught good weather."

I didn't go into the palace itself but went to the leisure palace, Monplaisir, at the far end of the property. We strolled throughout the gardens/fountains and I just loved the property and peace it brought. I'm sure it is just as nice in the winter! We arrived before the fountains were turned on (at 11am--it's a seasonal thing) so I got a \"before\" and \"after\" and it was beautiful. The palace was huge and gorgeous with a church attached. I did go to the Hermitage (the Winter Palace) so that gave me a glimpse of the opulence that I'm sure the inside of Peterhof contained. We did our exploring before the fountains were turned on and I was glad we did because what seemed like thousands of people were gathered around the fountains and it would've ruined the ambiance of the garden area with all those people running amuck! My mom uses a wheelchair so be aware that you can't get into the palace but you can see Montplaisir as it has no steps. However, since we were on a private tour our driver tried to let him in the gate to drive the car down this giant hill to get to the start of the garden area but no go. So if you are on a bus tour, you probably won't be able to either. So I couldn't get mom down the hill in her manual wheelchair without putting her in danger. If you have an electric one--you should be ok. Even walking the paths with a manual chair--it would've been tough as they are gravely/sandy so it would've been a struggle."

There is a separate entrance fee to the garden and palace, but I can\u00b4t remember how much they are, whatever they are worth paying. The palace is a grand place full of gold, art and history. The garden with the incredible golden fountain is a stunning sight. Taking a walk through the garden or even having a picnic there is a wonderful way to spend a summer day in Peterhof.

We boarded the hydrofoil outside the Hermitage and set out along the river past many key sites before going across the bay to Peterhof. It took about 25 minutes. The quay takes you in at the very end of the garden, and the first thing you see is the long green canal, flanked by fountains up to the imposing sight of the palace at the far end. Wow. For the next hour and a half our guide took us around the huge, but beautifully landscaped gardens. Obviously the main event is the sequence of gravity supplied fountains at the steps to the palace. Simply stunning. The rest of the area has pretty flower gardens, grand building and fountains, and many little attractions built to amuse the courtiers of the time. Clever little fountains to trick and surprise at every corner. It was a hot day but there were plenty of places for drinks and ice creams, and the inevitable people in costumes for those photo opportunities. We stayed until the grand turning off of the fountains at 6pm. We did not go into the palace. We got our bus back to town which took about an hour. This is a must do in St Petersburg, but do not forget your camera!"

You exit right outside the entrance gardens, which are free for all to see and incredibly beautiful, with their flower beds and fountains and tunnels, and of course the front view of the palace itself. On either side of the palace you'll find ticket booths where you can purchase tickets to the lower gardens behind the palace (you must enter the lower gardens to access any of the museums and the palace itself, but it's really worth it). They won't sell you tickets to the palace there, as the tickets to the palace must be purchased at the booth within the lower gardens. In the gardens you'll find countless magnificent fountains, as well as flower beds and a sort of river running from the palace straight to the opening of the Gulf of Finland). I suggest printing out a detailed map of the Peterhof gardens with the museums, statues and fountains all laid out beforehand, or alternatively you'll probably be able to purchase a map at the very beginning of the upper gardens - we got one of those for 30 rubles. Also, the fountains are turned off around 7pm. Inside the palace is gorgeous, and a guided tour is included in the 400 ruble price, although sadly all recording and photos are prohibited there. Be careful, because the ticket booth for the palace is only open from 12:00 to 14:00 and from 16:00 to 18:00 (I think). If there is more than one of you, I suggest one person queuing to buy the tickets and the other queuing to enter the palace, as the lines can be quite long. Having said that, they usually let 10-30 people into the palace at a time, so don't let the line intimidate you!You're probably better off visiting the palace and/or museums before checking out the rest of the gardens, as they can be quite tiring. They're huge, after all! If you're with kids, they'll love the fun fountains on the right side of the gardens. There are two silly ones - the umbrella and the tree - where they can play and get wet, and then there's a path near the chess board cascade where you'll randomly get water squirted at you out of nowhere (be careful if you have cameras on you) - look out for wet paths. You can also visit the palace by means of a boat from near the Hermitage to the Peyerhof mini-harbour. It can take you back to St Petersburg as well. The Peterhof Palace is a place you'll have to dedicate almost a whole day to, but it's really worth the while."

Constructed for Peter the Great early in the 18th century - the hydraulics of the estate were modelled by an Italian familiar with the Villa d;Este near ROME - each pipe is calibrated like an organ pipe; the thinner the pipe the more finely pitched the spray; The wider the calibre, the more powerful the column but to reach such a height that goes with it depends on the height at which the water has been stored. The palace -and its storage tanks ( that fill up by underground pressure overnight ) is built 30 metres above sea level so the spectacular display can be achieved. The spectacle therefore starts PROMPTLY at eleven and clearly can not run much past 5 p.m So with a tour of the house taking 45 minutes (NO PHOTOGRAPHS !!) your visit should last about 3 to 5 hours. Second warning: if you go via tour bus be prepared to hunt your bus among the huge numbers that arrive AFTER the turning on of the fountains. There is a reasonably priced restaurant (with primitive toilets in portacabins) down by the Gulf of Finland - Ladies might wish to us the facilities up by the Palace before lunch But there are lovely shaded woodland walks perfect if you take a picnic. Idyllic!!! Wheelchair users will be pleased to know that the steps are close to the House but two matching zig zag avenues are found one at each end of the terrace."

Plenty of shade to hide from the sun and cool areas to picnic. The little cafe (boasting a picture of the Duke of Kent) was fine for snacky food and a drink. The walkers are really good and you can climb the embankment to look at the gulf towards Finland and you will realise just how close Leningrad came to be being occupied.We spent around four hours in the gardens and spent some time sketching the little walled arbours on the embankment and watched the squirrels of course.It is also good to look through the gardens at the forefront of the palace and the beautifully pool larded trees and shady spots. The church (forget its name) just outside the gates is worth a visit especially during prayers if only for the chant inning et al.Good day for couples, families or even individuals I would say."

We were on a tour and this was our first stop. It is worth the drive, and I think one of the most beautiful places we saw in St. Petersburg. The fountains in the back of the palace are awesome; you are really struck by the golden figures, and we were lucky enough to be there in time for the fountains going off. You will know they are going to go off as the crowd starts to form. The best way to see it is from the gardens, so walk down into the gardens and look back at the palace, you won't be disappointed. After the show you can enjoy a leisurely stroll through the gardens.Again I would strongly recommend a tour or audio tour so you can hear about all the history. All told it takes almost half a day to get out and back, but this was my favorite stop on our first day in St. Petersburg."

We visited with a private guide, who was very professional and managed to avoid the worst of the lines and never the less - I think there must be a better way of managing huge numbers of tourists Peterhof receives every summer. There was a virtual stampede through the entrance and some of the smaller chambers of the Palace. It's an old building and there are plenty of bottlenecks to create a shoulder-to-shoulder cultural experience. Despite the best efforts of all the guides ( who are all very professional and seem to work with each other navigating the awful mess) there is a mass of people slowly crawling through every room with little room to breathe or have a closer look at anything. The park and fountains are beautiful and extremely pleasant despite the tourist numbers."

The palace was open just for tour groups so we found the rooms to be quiet and not crowded. Each room in the palace had its Russian lady doge moving groups along so don't expect to linger in a room too long. Besides, this pace helps to keep the tour interesting. Our guide took about 45 minutes to show us some of the lovely rooms inside this grand building after we had removed our outer coats (a must) at the cloakroom (free) and put on museum booties to cover our shoes. I was mesmerized by the Italian Baroque style of architecture which uses a lot of gilt trim on woodwork - on ceilings, walls, around doors, railings and furnishings, picture frames/mirrors. However the floors were done in lovely parquet or inlaid wood which seemed so appropriate here. We saw staircases, State rooms, private royal rooms, dining room, reception rooms. Each room has its own unique eye-appeal. Usually the ceilings have some sort of painting, set off with gold trim woodwork, of the czar's family cavorting in the woods.There is some furniture in the private rooms showing, for example, what a dining room would look like with a set table, or a sitting room with very comfy Turkish style seating and classic window treatment. As a show of wealth, blue delft corner fireplaces in some rooms were put into place to impress royal visitors. Grandfather clocks with gold leaf trim, also displayed the wealth of the czars. I loved to see the use of soft colors like seafoam, rose, and sapphire blue in the private rooms which made them seemed lived in. I think these rooms in Peterhof Palace are more interesting to see than those in the Versailles Palace to which Peterhof is compared. We were also taken to a room where Crimean battle scenes hung on the walls along with pictures of the military leaders. Returning to the cloak room to use the modern washrooms (free), retrieve our coats, and poke our noses into the gift shop filled with Russian craft like Faberge eggs and books, we headed outside. Since it was a rainy day, we just viewed the Cascade waterworks looking down to it from the top landing. One really must go down into the park to be impressed with the cascading water and the multiple golden classical sculptures lining each side. Unfortunately on a tour, each attraction is allotted a certain amount of time and gardens usually aren't given much viewing time. From what I saw, the layout of the waterworks towards the sea imitated Versailles', but not done in quite such a grand scale. The classical gardens are designed to focus on paths set amidst clipped greenery rather than informal flower beds and blooming shrubs. Around the fountain area, I saw that these paths used colored gravel (white and red) to provide a contrast to the greenery. Perhaps on another cruise to the Baltic, we will take a tour of these gardens and the pavillions in them. Peterhof's grand palace simply can't be missed on a visit to St. Petersburg!!"

We took the hydrofoil which was a great way to get there fro just outside the Hermitage. Entrance to the palace gardens is a separate ticket to everything else, so you are forever laying g to see things. If you have had and ugh of palace interiors spend your time wandering the gardens and enjoying the fountains. We spend 6 hours walking about. The one extra ticket I would recommend investing in is the grotto tour which shows you how the fountain system works and takes you inside the grotto. Beware the tour is in Russian only, but we figured out what it was mostly about just by looking around. Put this day tour on your itinery!"

Avoid weekends and public holidays when the locals descend en masse. The palace has been reconstructed but you won't be able to tell because they've done such a wonderful job.

Each room was different; they were all awesome. Couldn't understand why they wouldn't let pictures be taken inside; kind of stupid given the number of people visiting & cost to get there. Because we entered/departed palace grounds from the water, touring the gardens on the other side of the palace farthest from the water was impossible. Don't eat at the cafes on site because they are outrageously expensive; two small drinks and deserts cost $35. The couple behind purchased some food...not much...for six and it cost ~$250. Wow.

And heaven help you if you're behind someone paying by credit card. Anyway once you've paid; and this is only for the park, you then queue to get through the pitiful number of turnstiles. We didn't go into the palace but the garden in front of the palace is well worth the hassle of getting there. You cannot however go to the garden the other side of the palace as you need to go out and they won't let you back unless you pay again. And if you do venture out you can't get back to the hydrofoil jetty! You'd have to pay again to get back. .. Trust me this is true and I even got an official at the palace to eventually admit this was crazy.

Read on if you do not want to pay twice. My friend and I arrived in the morning on the hydrofoil after purchasing roundtrip tickets. We paid 500 rubles to enter the lower garden and arrived to see the fountains turn on with the music. We then made the mistake of visiting the palace soon after, which was swamped with tour groups. Better to leave it until later in the day. I believe the palace was another 500 rubles.After strolling around the lower garden we eventually left to visit the upper garden. They do clearly indicate that one must purchase a ticket to enter the lower garden. However, we had to come back into the lower garden to get to the hydrofoil. The workers there obviously know there are a number of tourists who arrive this way and must make there way back. A guidebook I had said that if you have your used lower garden ticket with you they will let you back in so you can get to the hydrofoil. I even had my return hydrofoil ticket to show them. The woman would not let us in along with another French couple who were in the same situation. The end result was that all of us had to pay another 500 rubles to get back into the lower garden. It was a fantastic day, but I left feeling bitter that they screwed us over like that. If I had to do it again I would buy a one way ticket on the hydrofoil to arrive in the morning to see the fountains turn on. Then, resist the temptation to go see the palace right away and go see the lower garden. You can have lunch at the cafe. Sometime in the afternoon visit the palace which hopefully should have less tour groups at that time. You can then visit the upper garden afterward and leave through the front gate. Take a train back to the city which should be a lot less than 500 rubles to get back into the lower garden for the hydrofoil. C'mon Peterhof management. You should be ashamed of yourselves for screwing over tourists who come to visit your country. I gave this a 5 because it is such a beautiful place. However, the people who manage Peterhof can suck it."

In winter I would recommend to choose Pushkin (also known asTsarskoe selo or Catherine's Palce).I strongly recommend to go there by hydrofoil. It leaves from the pier next to the Hermitage. It's not hard to buy a ticket there (which is about $ 25 per person) and it leaves every half hour. It only takes 30 kinutes to get there by hydrofoil, and you will enter from the beautiful Lower Garden. When you get there, don't go to the Grand Palace (the main one). It's not as pretty inside as it is outside and it's very crowded. Moreover, the ladies who sit in every room will push you to go through as fast as possible and you won't enjoy a single bit of it.Insted, go to one of the little pavilions in the park.For example, Monplaisir was the house of Peter the Great, the founder of your city, and has really cool and unusual stuff like his bedroom and his smoking pipes.There is a real Bath house remaining from 19th century with a sauna, showers etc., which belonged to one of Russian empresses.There are a lot of other interesting little houses, like the museum of yahts, playing cards or bikes.None of those pavilions are ever crowded."

If you have to choose between this and Catherine's Summer Palace, it is tough. The amber room there( the walls are amber) is unique. Except for that room, indoor photography is allowed. Peterhof has better grounds but no indoor photography. And the winner is??either or both!"

They are all quite different. You can eat on the run from small vending hot dog stands rather than sit in the restaurant which just wastes time. Taking the hydrofoil back to St Petersburg is also rather pleasant. Ensure that you have a small map of the gardens to make the most of the garden visit - explore the upper garden before the palace tour/lower garden as you won't have time to go back"

Some tourist information: Peterhof is easily accessible by public transport. From Metro Avtovo take the 200 or 201 bus. The busses all have conductors on who will take your fare and also tell you when to get off! Check opening times before you go, when I was there the palace was only open to pre-booked tours in the morning and the general public from 12. Also, get a map before you go. These are available free from most hotels and the Tourist information office. At the Palace you will have to pay for the map - and you do need one!"

Unfortunately the powers that be have divided parts of the palace and grounds up into separate pieces, making you pay for admission to each one rather than treating the entire palace and gardens as a whole. Obviously the only reason to treat different spots as separate and distinct elements is to make money, which I think they are making hand over fist. Be prepared for a large crowd of people to be gathered around every picturesque spot, waiting their turn for a photo opportunity. Certainly the large crowds just speak to the quality of the attraction, but it's awesomeness would have been multiplied ten fold with less people. Maybe try to get there early in the morning? Be on one of the first boats. If I could go back and do it again that's what I would do. Enjoy!"

Totally different and both excellent.So beautiful but do allow time to explore the grounds as well as inside!We did the evening tour with Oceania cruises and it is excellent and worth the price! The palace was closed to all but us.We did the day tour on a Princess cruise and their evening tour was slightly different but from all reports very enjoyable. We took a tour with SPB Tours during the day. My only complaint was we went to the bottom of the steps on the wrong side as when taking photos we were looking into the sun. If that happens to you insist on being able to go to the other side for photos as this is probably your only chance for that perfect photo. Thankfully, I had great photos from a previous tour in the evening.Definitely one of the best places to visit in St P."

When you arrive the view of the palace is wonderful long canals all the way to the place. Then you discover fountains and gardens around every corner. The crown jewel is the gold fountain behind the palace. You should pass on the palace tour and just look from the outside - trust me the gardens and fountains are amazing but the palace is fine but if you are thinking its Versailles in France its not, its nice inside but very plane. Spend the time in the gardens and be amazed by the engineering that each fountain took to build and power with no pumps and how high the water goes"

After a heart stopping ride on the \"freeway\" in rain so heavy we couldn't see the road ahead we arrived at the Peterhof Palace. There were 1000 to 1500 people standing in line in the pouring rain and a huge crowd clustered in front of the single open door where a guard was preventing anyone from entering. Our tiny and brave guide said she would go get our tickets and pushed her way through the crowd. We waited in the rain for 15 minutes before she returned with the tickets and told us we had to push our way in. The three of us slowly edged our way through the very unhappy and resisting crowd to the door.Once inside we proceeded to the required coat check area where we found total organized chaos. The women behind the counters were simply overwhelmed by the crowd. After finally leaving our coats and umbrellas we put booties over our shoes and joined the line touring the palace.The line moved quickly and the security guards, gruff unsmiling women, kept telling us to move along quickly. Alona kept telling the guards that we would like to take a moment to see the rooms we were passing through, but to no avail. As a result I have almost no memory of any of the rooms.Once we were finished with the tour we had to return to the coat check area to retrieve our checked items. The chaos had gotten worse due to the totally disorganized system. Everyone entering and exiting the coat check area had to go through one single doorway. There were at least 200 people crammed in one small room and it took at least one half hour to make it to the counter and then back through the same door. I was elbowed and shoved several times by extremely frustrated people.Once we exited the building we took a quick peek at the gardens. It was still pouring rain so we could only see a short distance into them, but what we could see looked lovely.The Peterhof was totally restored after it was destroyed by the Germans during the Siege of Leningrad during WWII so it has a bit of a \"stage set\" feeling to it. The terrible weather and the disorganization really impacted our impression of the Peterhof and our experience might have been totally different if the weather had been better."

Rest along the way - it's a LOT to see. You can get a good glimpse in a couple of hours, but it's worth an entire day to relax in the gardens and have lunch.It's always worth seeing how the one-hundredth-of-the-One Percent lived. After all, you realize that the great equalizer eventually brings us all together - some not as peacefully as others. My favorite here (nominal extra charge, but DO IT) is the \"Little Hermitage\" - a small house where honored guests from foreign lands were entertained. The centerpiece, aside from the art and the view on the Baltic Sea, is a mechanical dining table straight out of Leonardo's (or de Sade's?) imagination. The Rube Goldberg-worthy contraption lowers all the plates down a couple of floors to the kitchen, where staff (who couldn't be trusted to mingle with the higher-and-mightier) loaded the food into perfectly aligned positions, then crancked the entire thing upwards into the waiting arms of the cognoscenti (please keep your pinky fingers extended at all times, dahling). One can't help but marvel, but it helps to do so with tongue firmly planted in cheek.Yet the very best part of Peterhof are the gardens - with sculpture and design (not to mention ingenious plumbing) second to none on Earth, provided in loving measure by the French, the Italians, and the Germans. Not necessarily in that order.You can take a bus here from the Avtova Metro Station or from just in front of the Baltiskiy Railroad station. It's not far, and you'll get a better view of the suburban environs for the miniscule fare. But be sure to take the hydrofoil boat back to town from the dock at Peterhof. The approximately $15 one-way ticket is well worth the ride and the different view from the Baltic sea.If you rented one of the digital players that tell you about all the exhibits in various languages (recommended) you can return it and get your cash deposit back near the dock, without returning to the front entrance.Don't miss it."

The palace is also a wonderful piece of architecture and the contents are some of the best you will ever see. We were on a tour with serious time constraints and regret not doing the gardens and the palace justice. Exacerbated by the apparent disorganised security system. Have no problem with security in wonderful places such as the Peterhof palace. The difficulty arises in actually getting into the palace and if you have a jacket and or large bag they need to be handed into the cloak room. The area where you hand in your coat and/or bag is in a very narrow area of the palace. People trying to hand in their belongings and others trying to pick them up. So be prepared for long queues and claustrophobic environment. Once through all this, the palace is magnificent. Taking of photos is prohibited. But leave plenty of time to see it all as it covers a vast area. It is worth it."

We took the local, surburban train from (name of train station in St PEtersburg - take the subway to xx and it's XX rubles for a return ticket. Trains go abut once an hour and there is a very helpful machine at the train station that not only allow you to buy tickets (cash and card, although we used cash) and to check out the timetables on the machine. Once you arrive at the Peterhof station, there is also a printed timetable, so you can time your arrival back at the station.The hydrofoil from SPB to Peterhof wasn't running during May when we took the trip, so we saved ourselves the more than 1000 ruble fee and took in a little of the countryside too. The surburban train was full, and its not the most comfortable, but it's cheap and mostly Russian visitors who were on it. Once you arrive at the station, its about a 40 minute saunter through the woods to the main entrance to Peterhof. I always raise my eyebrows when people type \"just follow the crowds\", but its true. Come out of the station, cross the road, and head off to the left through the woods, its a wide open path, and even at the end, when you head to the right and onto the main road for a further 10 minutes or so its obvious which way to head (having a general sense or google maps is also helpful). If you don't want a wander then there are buses and taxis waiting at the station to drop you at the main entrance.It's worth going to the main entrance, so that you get the impact of the front of the palace and the fountains and gardens as you walk down towards the ticket booths. We opted for the entrance to the grounds ticket. It was the first day after the fountains had opened for 2014, and it was a glorious day, so it was pretty busy. Signs in English are limited, but the woman in the information booth was able to tell us that we could only buy a combined ticket to include the palace at the automated booth, if we just wanted entrance we had to queue like everyone else. A XX rubles its quite a hefty cost to just wander around, but the lower gardens are beautiful.There were no maps that we could see to take away, although touts outside were selling them, so we took a photo of the map board by the ticket booths and navigated using that. After picnicing on the beach, we toured the fountains. It's easy to walk around and to navigate, and there's a big variety in plantings, in fountains and in the gardens themselves. Its very easy to lose the day here. A variety of cafes dot the grounds and there's even a fishing pond where you can hook a trout? or other fish - but the pond is so full that you literally just have to drop the hook in the water and you've caught something.Make sure to take time to look through the photo boards of the reconstruction that had to take place after WWII and you'll get a sense for how marvelous the place is."

Definitely eat inside since you can roam the Garden for a nice spot to sit and watch the view.- If the ticket line to the Palace is short, perhaps go to the Palace first and then venture to the garden afterwards.- You can either take the hydrofoil to Peterhof or take one of many tour bus from St Petersburg to Peterhof. Price wise, its not much of a difference and even though we took the tour bus, we believe we made the wrong move since you are then under tour bus timeframe (departs at 10:30, returns around 5:30) whereas with the hydrofoil, you dictate the time you want to spend.- There is a separate ticket charge to the Grand Cascade and Samson Fountain, definitely try and get tickets since you will be able to get better pictures as you are right in the action rather than taking it from the stairs on either side of the cascade/fountain."

The complex is a Russian Versailles, but whereas the fountains at Versailles are all classical, the ones at Peterhof come in all sorts of styles, meaning that you need to allow time to walk around the gardens. The inside of the palace is beautifully restored and the queue for tickets was reasonably short. Be aware that if you leave the Lower Gardens in order to see the Upper Gardens (no ticket required) on the other side of the Palace, you won't be able to get back into the Lower Gardens without buying a new ticket unless you show your hydrofoil tickets (which show that you need to re-enter the Lower Gardens to get back to the quay)."

We took the hydrofoil from nearby the Hermitage to Peterhof which was fast and convenient. The fountains are beautiful and just hit you as you arrive - really breathtaking. The palace and surrounding buildings are well worth a visit too, even if you are made to wear silly looking covers on your shoes in the chapel, for instance. We had Russian student cards which let us in to the buildings for free - a price was advertised so I'm not sure why, possibly something along the lines of the Russian/foreigner prices that are in most places but we weren't going to question it however there are student prices available for foreign students so long as you have you ID with you. Totally worth going, even if you just visit the gardens. Best seen when the weather is nice but a great trip regardless."

Try taking the boat to Peterhof (called Meteor), one of the docks is right opposite the Winter Palace, one way adult ticket is 700 rub, as of June 2014 (but there are discounts, for students for instance, even if you are a foreigner, just have your ID with you). The boat trip takes 30 min, and then you get to the ticket booths at the park entrance and can buy the entrance ticket.The Palace appeared to be hard to get into (again as of June 2014), when we arrived there already was a line and the anoouncement said they will sell only 200 tickets that day. So, if you want to go inside - book a tour, or come there early (the first boat is at 10 am).There are not so many places to eat - so I'd say bring your own food (many people do so), find a nice spot on the beach and have a picnic with a bay view.Oh, very important - the restrooms :). The ones close to the chessboard fountain were very crowded (ladies section, men's was surprisingly empty), we stood in line for 10-15 min. SO, check the map beforehand and choose the ones which are a bit farther from the crowded areas.On the way back we went to the Upper Park (which is free of charge) and took a shuttle bus to the closest subway station. The bus stop is on your right, on the opposite sid eof the road when you walk out of the Upper Park. the cost is something around 50 rub. But for non-Russian speaking visitors this can be challenging :). Otherwise, you can return back down to the dock and take the same boat back to the city (the latest leaves at 6pm if I'm not mistaken)."

The garden and fountains are truly stunning. The beautifully landscaped paths lead to magnificent sculptures, views and fountains to be enjoyed. There is a small forest for summer shade and a nice seafront promenade. We stayed over 3 hours but were rushed. If we hadn't already booked a return ticket we could have stayed longer.

It was a stunning, opulent palace, with extensive gardens & apparently, different floral displays at different times of the year...think we enjoyed the gardens even more than the Palace. It was lovely walking around and as it was sunny & 31 degrees during our visit, it was great having a lot of dappled shade to wander around in! It is a good idea to book a trip in the morning as this is when the fountains are switched on, which is spectacular. For people with mobility issues, it is worth noting that there is a longish flight of steps to each side of the fountains for access down to the gardens and back up - one lady we were with struggled up the stairs at the end; not sure if there were ramps elsewhere but it would be worth asking in advance with your tour guides. However it still wouldn't greatly spoil your trip..some other ladies asked the guide what time they could meet back up later and they did a lesser walk around without having to do the steps. Just check what your options are in advance so you are aware. Plenty of toilet facilities around too which is always good!"

While much enlarged by his successors, its heart is still very much his monument. The Gardens are world famous for the fountains, especially the trick ones that offer a surprise dousing to the unwary, or really, the aware but adventuresome visitor. The Nazis devastated the grounds and buildings. The Soviets, whatever their very real faults, devoted years of meticulous work to restoring the building to its original splendor. It is a must see for any visitor to the St. Petersburg area. Please take the time to study the photos of the extensive damage done by the Nazis and compare that with the glory of the restoration."

Your admission ticket pays for the lower grounds area which is vast with many ponds, fountains, walking paths. The palace has a separate entry fee. There are many souvenir and food stands. You can pay 800 rubles for a golf cart tour. Numerous picturesque views with excellent photo opportunities. Go in the morning and make it a day trip. This would be far less enjoyable if the weather was cold or rainy, as so much of this is outdoors. Kid friendly, lots of strollers."

And no free map available either. And........ there are tons of small museums/exhibitions/overpriced shutter service inside, and it likely costs you thousands of rubs to finish them, don't forget to prepare you tens of rubs for toilet cost...... I think local govt should do sth to improve the service due to it doesn't match the reputation of Peterhof itself."

On a good day, the outbound trips fill up fast so try and plan in advance. The hydrofoil starts at 10am so book your ticket at the ticket office according to when you want to leave. You need about three hours for the gardens alone. Book the time of your return trip up front as seats in the hydrofoil are limited. You will need to pay to enter the gardens as well. However, there is no English signage at the ticket office, and none of the cashiers spoke English. We ended up paying 500 rubles to enter but had no idea whether this included the Palace as well as the gardens. We only wanted to see the gardens so we may have been overcharged, but we had no way of knowing. We packed a picnic and found a shady spot in the gardens to have our lunch. It was a great way to stop and relax and enjoy the calmness. A fun thing to do is head towards the Trick Fountains. There is a sign telling you when the next one starts. If you're in for a bit of a cool-down on a hot day, stand on the tree-lined avenue and wait for the fountains to spray you. Be warned though, you will be soaked through! We ended off our visit by walking along the edge of the beach. It is obviously a popular spot for wedding photos - we spotted three brides in 30 minutes having their photo shoots done there! Definitely worth seeing Peterhof for the opulence and fountains."

The downside was the trip through the interior of the palace itself. The inside sites are also superb. The conditions walking through the beautifully appointed rooms were deplorable with 250 or more people in each room at the same time with as many as 4 tour guides talking in that room at the same time. It was surely just as unpleasant as being a bovine at the livestock auction. The tour guides were partially responsible but the associates of the attraction were pushing groups forward about 5 speeds faster than comfortable. Don't miss the exterior and gardens.

We didn't go with a tour, but there were dozens of tour groups there and you need to go through the rooms in sequence, so we just listened as the many other tour guides explained the differences in each room.Lower gardens were large, but not that special (lots of trees and fountains) and there are many museums all over the grounds, but you have to pay for each one, so we didn't go in.Overall a good visit, but the Palace was definitely the highlight, even at the expense."

Unfortunately we could not approach the fountains. We had to stay behind the barriers. But the site in unbelievable. The fountains start at 11h00. So do not get there before. The water comes from sources located 10km away. Every fountain is feed by gravity. No pumping at all. A real engineering feat. At night, water accumulates in few reservoirs. The next day, water is let go from the reservoirs and start it descend toward the fountains.The site is immense. Thousands of trees, flowers everywhere. You can walk the park for hours. But it is crowdy. Fortunately for us, our ship was opening the tourist season; so we were not sqeezed amongst thousands of people. We could easily walk the gardens and take zillions of pics.This is a must see attraction."

We were there independently and found the lack of information totally confusing. There seem to be times when only Russians were allowed in and queue jumping was rife. We eventually got in, were given directions to go in a certain direction only to be sent back to get tickets! Having bought tickets we were accosted and forced to check our shoulder bags in despite the fact that we had been through that process a few minutes earlier with no problem. We were herded into groups with only a Russian language guide and not allowed to go through independently. The staff could all have got a part in a James Bond movie and had clearly had a training manual which stated: don't smile, wag your finger and be as oppositional as you can.

The main attractions are Tsarskoe selo and Peterhof. Well, when it comes to visiting Peterhof, I'd definitely recommend seeing it in late spring or summer, because its main attraction lies in the park full of beautiful fountains that won't operate until May, or, sometimes in late April as they are being tested. They make for a really pleasant walk. I haven't seen the Palace itself, as you can only enter with a tour group and the number of visitors was limited. All of this I only knew by asking the lady at the entrance in Russian and I doubt whether you'd be able to get the same information in English. So if you don't go as a part of a tour group with a bus from Gostinniy dvor in Petersburg, this place does not seem very tourist-friendly.Entrance to the grounds is free and the walks are nice, you can get some refreshments and souvenirs. However, to Petersburg first-timers and visitors in autumn and winter I'd rather recommend visiting Tsarskoe selo instead."

The best way of transportation is to take the speedy hydrolift boats going on an hourly basis from St. Petersburg, but it is a reasonably painless drive by car as well, approx 1 hrs from St. Pete. However, I reccomend the boattrip. Once at Peterhof enjoy the opulence and goldcoated fountains in the vast gardens, the buildings are also spectacular and in perfect condition after many years of maticulate restauration. I reccomend to bring a picnic-basket and camp out by the banks of the gulf of Finland as the food available to buy in the various cafe's and restaurants is both of a low quality and very expensive!

Personally I went to Avtovo metro and then got a marshrutka right to the gates - they're easy to find as soon as you leave the station. Although the park was very beautiful, I was surprised by the price with comparison to everything else - it seemed a lot more expensive, and every museum and extra part of the palace was excluded from the price - in total it was exactly a cheap outing! I definitely think it was made wonderful by the fountains - even though it was cold and raining a little when I went, it was still worth seeing. Take a picnic - the food is very expensive!

It was decided just to explore the gardens and waterfalls and these were really spectacular and in our opinion were better than those at the Palace of Versailles, that we had visited the previous month, We can imagine how grand the interior must have been but that may have to wait for another visit. Some of the many waterfalls can be seen from my tattached photos as well as gold inlay for most tof the statues and spires of the palaces.

They do rush the palace tours, but then a lot of people want to see it. Cruise ship tour groups can get in before the official opening time. Our friends had also been here before and we all wanted to explore the grounds more, so we passed on the palace tour this time and went out to the West rear grounds. We were there early in the morning, so the fountains weren\u2019t on yet. After wandering for a while, we staked out a place on the first bridge over the canal about an hour prior to catch the start of the fountains. I took video while my friend took stills with a tripod. We all enjoyed watching the fountains come to life while the music played. Afterward, we headed toward the East side, but ran out of time before we got too far.There\u2019s a lot to see and it can get quite crowded with all the cruise boat tourist buses (like ours), so I would recommend getting there early and making a day out of it.

Not to despair. The grounds are wonderful. Our family of three enjoyed an entire day here, spending way more time than we thought we would. Interesting fountains, lovely trees, plantings, etc, etc, etc, in all directions. Places to eat and have ice cream. Places to sit and people watch. Fabulous: Russian mothers in stiletto heels pushing strollers on gravel walkways. I started taking photos of those 5\" heels! Back to Peterhof. It is worth an entire day. Many, many 'local' tourists: Russian families out for the day. They arrive by car, not the hydrofoil. I loved this place. So did my husband and adult son. Hope we can return. Wish it was not so far from NYC."

Of the 4 main palaces in the St. Petersburg area - the others being Catherine's Palace, Yusupov Palace, Hermitage (museum with palace interior) - Peterhof is the most scenic because of its location on the Gulf of Finland and the sloping site that leads down to the sea.The gardens with 66 fountains, 39 gold-guilded statues and 20 km of manmade canals are a \"sight\" to behold. If you have enjoyed Versailles, Schoenbrunn or Hampton Court among others, this park ranks right there at the top. Built in the 1700s as Russia's \"Window to Europe\" the grand palace was meticulously restored after the German destruction and siege of Leningrad in WWII according to Peter The Great's original plans. From May - September take the hydrofoil from the Hermitage Embankment for an unforgettable arrival.Peterhof should not have its own sight category; it is confusing to separate it from the other spectacular sight in St. Peterburg. And the photo does not do any justice to the grandeur of the palace."

As you enter the palace you are led up the main staircase, which is tremendous, into the magnificent Dance Hall and so it goes on, room after room. Peterhof Palace must one of the most beautiful buildings in the world.Outside there are wonderful gardens with hundreds of fountains and statues, but the piece de resistance is the Grand Cascade which consists of more than 60 fountains and over 250 statues. Although the palace was all but destroyed by the german army after the siege of St Petersburg, the russian authorities have faithfully reproduced the original palace.Guided tours are generally for half a day but it doesn\u2019t seem long enough. We recommend you buy a book e.g \u201cPETERHOF\u201d which contains the history and a description of the palace and hundreds of photographs that you would love to have taken."

            "review": "Be mindful of the seasons. I can consider myself an insider because I was born and grew up in St-Petersburg before moving to the US years ago. I've been to Peterhof many times over the years, and traveled to the park by boat, train, and bus. When I think about St-Petersburg, the Peterhof park is one of the first places that come to mind. It is so beautiful, with such remarkable balance and integrity, that any other garden or fountain complex pales in comparison. Enough was said on the Tripadvisor about impressions and emotions, and many pictures were posted. I can only add some practical information which is often left out.First and foremost of all, it is a combination of palace with an outdoor park with ensemble of sculptures and fountains. Fountains are seasonal. They are turned on as soon as night temperatures go over the freezing point (typically at the very end of April) and are turned off for the winter in mid-September. During the fountains season, it is a not-to-miss top attraction in the St-Petersburg area. You can't say you've been to St-Petersburg unless you visited Peterhof. In contrast, in winter the significance of this place drops in my mind to the bottom of the top ten or even lower, and can be skipped altogether.The second factor is that the weather is paramount. You have to get there on a sunny day or at least on a day without the rain. It is an easy trip, you do not need to book anything in advance, just get up in the morning and if it is sunny, go for it. If it rains, go elsewhere. The weather in St-Petersburg is not bad in summer, but it is not very predictable.The most enjoyable way to get there is by boat - hydrofoil. The trip starts from the city center, from a dock right in front of the State Hermitage, and it takes only about half an hour to get straight to the park. You do not have to commit to a specific time for a return trip. It is a little more expensive than getting there by train or bus, but it is a lot faster, and it is a fun experience in itself since you get nice views of the city along the way. After I tried all existing ways and means of getting to Peterhof (trains, buses, even a group tour), all my last trips were by hydrofoil, and if I go there again, this will be my means to travel.. The palace is nice, it would be a major attraction in most European countries, but it is a relatively minor attraction in St-Petersburg which is blessed with so many fine palaces. I visited the Peterhof palace a couple of times and I was not too much impressed. It is a relatively small palace and it is not nearly as impressive as some other palaces in St-Petersburg. Peterhof is about the park and the fountains.While a tour is a good way of learning about the history of this place, I find it more valuable just to walk around the grounds and enjoy the spirit and the views. It is so beautiful there that the history in a way loses its meaning and value. A tour would be more of a distraction from enjoyment than a benefit. With this in mind, there is no added value in taking a bus tour (unless you want to get into the palace and would rather do it with a group to avoid waiting in line) or spending precious time on a metro, bus, or train for the sake of saving money. Just get on the boat and spent a day which is worth a lifetime. This is a place which is impossible to forget and which is nothing like what you have ever seen or will ever see. Make sure you have lots of room on your memory card for pictures.Plan to allocate the whole day for this trip if you can. Common sense and experience would tell you that one does not need much time to see a park. Don't fall into this trap because this park is huge, its every corner is worth a visit and will give you memories for a lifetime. The park is THE outdoor royal palace in Peterhof. Try to get there around the time when the park opens to enjoy a little bit of solitude, take pictures of the great cascade, and to not feel rushed. Having said that, since the park is so big, crowds are not much of an issue (except lines into the palace, but I would suggest that you skip the palace unless you have nothing better to do). Be prepared to walk large distances. Food in the park is pricey, if you want to save, bring snack and sandwiches."

We just picked one of the tour companies outside Gostiny Dvor. It turned out to be a wonderful afternoon. The bus was comfortable and our guide spoke excellent English. It was interesting to see some of the countryside especially the housing communities close to Peterhof. We toured the palace first. Yes, it is very opulent and lavish. Yes, it is much like other palaces throughout Europe, but I thought the tour offered a unique perspective on Russian royalty. The portrait hall was interesting and something I hadn't seen before. The gardens and fountains are beyond description. It was a beautiful day and the gold and the water just sparkled in the sunlight. While I can't say it is more impressive than Versailles, I was immensely impressed by the planning and care given to each section. Since the G20 was being held in Petersburg, we were told the crowd was light that day. That being said, it was extremely difficult to walk around and take pictures at the main fountains behind the palace due to the amount of people. We were still there quite late in the afternoon and that time afforded us the best views and pictures of the fountains. I was disappointed not to be able to take the hydrofoil to the palace because I'm certain those first glimpses of Peterhof from the Gulf of Finland must be simply spectacular!"

Peterhof was destroyed by the Nazis in WWII after their 4 year occupation but, amazingly, has been restored to its original beauty. It's really something to see such opulence in its new condition when we are used to seeing the rather faded versions in the UK. Fortunately, most of the contents were evacuated before the occupation and are now returned to Peterhof or displayed at L'Hermitage in St Petersburg (an essential visit). A series of \"wows!\" will be heard and felt as you tour this amazing place.It was very quiet in late December and the room guides were unobjectionable.Fountains obviously not working in Russian winter but it is plain to see these would be stunning. We enjoyed walking through the grounds and by the sea.The palace is not so far from the city and I find it interesting to see a big of non city living after 6 days of visiting Moscow and St Petersburg. Handy for a last day visit as you can reach the airport without having to go through the gridlocked traffic in the city.The restaurant is good value and the food was good. Waiting staff friendly and efficient. Clean and comfortable surroundings, with an option to eat outside in warmer weather. Didn't try the loos but am confident these would have been fine too."

It was just after the G-20 conference so there must have been some sort of a gathering at Peterhof for the G-20 attendees. Anyway, the large fountains were not working and there were many workers milling about removing large equipment. The most scenic way to reach Peterhoff is by sea using the hydrofoils from St. Petersburg however one can go by tour bus. It was not very crowded as it is a huge estate and parkland, many flowers, fountains, pathways to wander through and around. Peter the Great built this palace and his daughter Empress Elizabeth added on to it. Enjoy the \"Joke\" fountains where unsuspecting visitors will get wet! It is written that Peter the Great would take his guests to these fountains and would think it very funny to get them soaked, especially those he might have disagreed with. Sounds fun to me! I won't tell you where they are but you should discover this for yourself. One fountain that people waited for was a series of fountains along a path that people ran through. Ask around for the time this fountain turns on - children and adults had fun running through it."

You get dropped off at Peterhof and then can tour both the grounds and their many interesting fountains and pay the fee to tour the palace.This is an all day adventure if you take the boat. The grounds are worth at least a couple hours and the place tour takes an hour. Buy a set of the postcards to get the best views of the wonderful rooms.I almost did not go after seeing the Hermitage and Catherine's Palace. Peterhof is far better than Catherine's if you only have time to visit one and the boat ride there showed a bit of the countryside."

Note going there cheaply from the city involves the subway and small buses, so if you are not adventurous enough to figure them out see if you can arrange a group of travelers and ask your hotel to come up with a taxi. I also think if you go in the summer boat rides are available so check that too, although I believe they're expensive.I recommend spending at least four hours, if not an entire day, because it's not just that the fountains are amazing, but the grounds are gigantic. You can walk down to the bay and see Finland (hmm, or at least we thought it was Finland), not to mention a good bit more of various coastlines including a nuclear power plant, and then go to the left or right on bridal or formal paths and see more wonderful fountains and ponds and foiliage. My son says whenever he sees estates this opulent, his first question is why Russia didn't have a revolution earlier.We went on October 16 on a cold but sunny day, and we were blown away the fountains were still running--my son's Russian girlfriend says they usually shut down earlier. That turned out to be terrific timing because it was almost deserted, and it was charming to have the place to ourselves with lots of fall foliage still out.My son's girlfriend made one recommendation about Peterhof--don't go when the fountains are first turned on in spring--apparently the place is a total zoo. Unfortunately, she made another recommendation which we ignored because it was cold, and that was to absolutely not go to the restaurant in the park because it was an unbelievable ripoff. We looked at the menu outside and figured if we ordered a soup and coffee each it was pricey but not awful, so we dragged her in. When we got our bill, it was for $100. We were charged for pats of butter and lemon slices for tea, $15 for a small bottle of sparkling water because it \"came from Italy\" (hmm, couldn't find that brand on an internet search), and so forth, so we were just appalled. I decided to pay in cash because I really didn't want to give possible scam artists my credit card, and I counted the money twice and gave it to the waiter. He disappeared and came back about five minutes later and said I was short 500 rubles. I used to count money for a living so it's quite unlikely I was wrong, so I handed him even more money and resolved never to give cash to waiters without counting it out in front of them so I'd have witnesses.So bring a picnic. Other than that, Peterhof is just spectacular and more than worth the trip to get there."

What can one say about Peterhof that has not already been conveyed with an abundance of superlatives, probably not a great deal. I will add that it is possibly the best place to eat an ice-cream on a sunny summer\u2019s day.The grounds are what you would expect to see from possibly the greatest Russian Tsar and an obvious landscaping genius. I travelled there with a couple of new found friends firstly via Metro, train and foot, then just for the experience via Hydroplane. Unfortunately it rained while I was on the hydroplane, but that is another story. The Hydroplane made it super easy to get to and did not cost the earth, but was much more expensive than going via suburban train.It was easy to get to and easy to get around, even for a novice visitor with a sore foot.The palace is stunning, breathtaking and even the mandatory surly babushkas seemed somewhat happy in there. The grounds are a marvel and are simply wonderful in the full splendour of summer. I would love to visit in the autumn just to see how they are during that time of year, maybe also in winter, possibly spring too. Take a day, or two to experience this and the surrounds, there are a number of nice palaces nearby and a beautiful old wooden church. Peterhof is well priced and even the food was not bad considering the environment and captive market.Children will love the park and especially the trick fountain. Everyone else will just love the magnificence of it. Bring a good camera and take pictures early, then just relax.To eat an ice-cream there should be on everyone\u2019s bucket list."

The Palace itself was superb, the rooms so richly decorated and full if interesting items, the only problem was the it is a VERY place and you tend to shuffle from room to room, sometimes not really having time to admire what you are looking at.This movement is enforced by aggressive looking female room stewards, who would get onto Natalia if we lingered too long in any one place, But it is a marvellous Palace, well worth a visit. The gardens are just as fascinating, the fountains are brilliant, especially the Grand Cascade. The flower beds are also stunning. The only problem on our visit, was that the G20 summit was being held the following week at the Palace, so there were scaffolding towers for lights and cameras all over the place and a huge media centre at the top of the sea canal, so trying to take a photo without these in was a problem.

Each has its own attraction.As to be expected, there were very many fellow tourists but there was more than sufficient space for most people to feel comfortable.The Palace is a very large structure with many, many rooms.

You can spend a whole day simply exploring the interior and, as with the park, I felt there was sufficient room for everyone, though it was very busy.This is a destination you must visit."

It is a bit of a drive from St. Petersburg. We hired an English speaking guide and it was worth every penny. We learned so much about what we saw. The palace is more than beautiful. It is opulence in every way. Gold baroque style is everywhere. Paintings and furnishings.and silk wall covering plus the history will be overwhelming. We were there in October and the fountains were turned off but the outside garden areas were still lovely and full of statues. Try to visit when the water is running. Amazing thing to see."

Really interesting place - it looks massive from the outside but in fact the interior rooms are quite small - a nod towards the climate here I think and how difficult it would have been to heat big rooms. Every room is beautifully decorated and maintained as it would have been originally, each room has a fascinating story and history. We all remarked on the short bed in the male bedroom - they used to sleep sitting up for their blood pressure so never lay down flat! The grounds are absolutely stunning - you can walk right down to the shore of the Gulf of Finland. At the end of October we had some snow on our visit and it was bitingly cold already, so I can only imagine what the depths of winter are like here! The fountains were all still in action and on a day with clear blue skies the gardens looked beautiful. I would like to revisit in the height of summer!"

I have never been anywhere that was more crowded, you literally could not turn around and the restrooms were totally inadequate for the amount of people they had there. It was a good 20 minute wait. You have a coat check and another purse check and eventually you get to where they give you little booties to wear so you do not scratch the floor with your shoes. The inside was beautiful and the rooms were exqusite. The staff in the rooms were not helpful and in some cases quite rude but the palace itself was beautiful. It is hard to believe that when the Nazi\u2019s left it they blew it up and it had to be totally restored. I was really upset that they did not let you take pictures of anything inside the palace. The Highlight of the visit of course is the Stair Stepped Fountains. The Gold statue of Sampson in the middle is magnificent and the hundreds of sculptures and fountains are breathtaking. When we came out of the palace it had stopped raining and it was great. The Fountains start exactly at 11:00 and the first five minutes they play very exhilarating and patriotic sounding music that is tremendous. I wish we could have stayed longer. DO NOT miss the fountains if you go to Peterhof they are un-believable and something you just have to see if you possibly can in your lifetime. Pictures do not do it justice, you have to be there and experience the music and the water and the spray of the fountains."

Bigger than life size gilded cherubs and nymphs spewing fountain water and mists. Arranged on the side of a hill . Beautifully laid stairways and gardens and more fountains . Peter the Great had a wicked sense of humor in some of the designs of fountains. One was to dunk his guests from hidden fountains spray nozzles. One was again to dunk his guests when they wanted to go to a central umbrella covered island.  I can not explain. It is something to behold and experience . Words can not express the joy of being there. Even photographs and videos can not do justice unless a professional does them well.The garden is big . It stretches up to the Neva river near the Gulf of Finland. In a clear day one can see St. Petersburg from the edge of the garden.It is an ideal place for couples to frolick."

The Palace: impressive outside and worth discovering the inside with different rooms of different design, picture taking is strictly forbidden, you should record in your brain. The rooms are so magnificent that you won't struggle at this.The gardens: Very big, like a \"nature-walk\" for the visitor, clean and healthy, very impressive statues and architecture, definitely see the seaside too. Both of those are definitely a \"not-to-miss\"... and even if you're there for a few days only, definitely spare half a day for this place.The Access: Two ways there: Either you take a ridiculously expensive guided tour from city center (like around 2500-3000 rub per head) but you don't struggle for the transportation, Either you choose the adventurous way we did; and do the following:From anywhere downtown, grab the metro and go to the station Avtovo on the red line, and from there, take the minibuses on which is written \"Fountain\" and \"Petergof\" in Russian. Pretty easy!Cost of the travel? 28rub for the metro and 70rub for the minibus, making it approx. 200rub return. Don't even bother taking the outrageous hydrofoil from Hermitage (1100 rub return)"

The Parks were very busy with both tourists and locals, and many families seemed to be enjoying a day strolling and playong around the Trick Fountains in particular.Some of these involve you getting lighly sprayed with water as you walk past a certain point in the grounds, others have kids trying to run past a folly without getting wet etc.Great sense of humour shown by Peter! Loved the chessboard fountain and the group playing percussion instruments at the base of it.My favourite part was getting to the far side and seeing Mon Plaisir on the edge of the Gulf of Finland.This was Peter's real \"home\" here, and is a much more modest building, but with views truly to die for, all the way out into the Gulf.Worth going here just to see this! A lovely day out, and a pleasant break from visiting all the artworks etc in palaces!"

The Peterhof Palace (Russian: \u041f\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0433\u043e\u0301\u0444) is an amazing place to see and is also known as the Summer Palace. It was founded by Peter the Great in 1714. The Palace is 19 miles from St. Petersburg. We arrived around 9:30 am at the south gate of Peterhof Palace\u2019s Upper Park. Although the Peterhof Grand Palace opened at 10:30 am, our guide pushed us to go fast when we were in the Upper Park in order to avoid the long queue at the entrance. The Upper Park is a quiet retreat and beautiful garden unlike the shining uniqueness of the Lower Park that attracts all tourists. It is a large garden with fountains, sculptures, pools and trees. We really enjoyed the morning walk through the Upper Park before we met the crowd at the gate to the Grand Palace and Great Cascade with the famous fountains.We were the first group at the Peterhof Grand Palace entrance. The Grand Palace contains 30 rooms and not as delicate compared to other palaces such as the Hermitage and the Catherine Palace. The Chesma Hall, Picture Hall and Chinese Cabinets are the highlights of the visit. What bothered us the most was that the ladies on duty always pushed us moved on. It was really annoying, and I never had such bad experience before. One more thing that I didn\u2019t like was that photos and videos are prohibited inside the Grand Palace. I would like to give it 5 for the rating, but for the reasons above I can only give it 4. After the Grand Palace, we went outside and looked down on the Lower Park where we saw the magnificent Grand Cascade fountain group and many golden sculptures. It is a pity that we did not have enough time to walk through the garden down to the Gulf of Finland, but we could see it from the terrace. We were lucky it was a sunny day during our visit and gave all the golden decorations the chance to show its best to us. There are so many steps on both side of staircase; you are better off having comfortable shoes to enjoy those golden statues, ornaments on the fountains, and the rest of the attractions on the Lower Park."

Parking can be a bit of a problem with the crowds. Multiple lavishly decorated and furnished rooms and displays. There is so much gold, detail, wealth, beautify and history on display there, truly awesome in size, amount and variety. The palace grounds are almost as spectacular as the palace itself. Take time to look at all the paths, plant life, views, fountains, and small buildings on the grounds, as well as lovely views of the Gulf of Finland. There are some \"trick\" fountains which catch people by surprise - a very refreshing shower on a hot summer day, taken with shrieks and good humor by those in range of the sprays! The entire complex was truly an engineering marvel by Peter the Great, especially for its time in history. As with any crowded venue in St. Petersburg, be aware that there are pickpockets and large compacted crowds. There are places to eat on the grounds, and the very light snack I had was OK but not great typical Russian \"pie\" of a baked crust with potato and mushroom filling. Wear good walking shoes and plan to walk a lot - this is a huge property. Amazing that one royal family could accumulate wealth and goods to this degree, and that so much of it has survived and/or been restored. Well worth the time to visit."

You have to check coats, bags etc. and it's a single LONG line if you get there with or after the busses. The place is the Czars' entry in the competition for conspicuous consumption.... you have to go the Versailles (Paris) or Sans Souci (Potsdam outside Berlin) to decide for yourself who was most over the top. The grounds and gardens are quite enjoyable themselves and an excellent antidote for the stress of being herded through a palace of gilt. The grounds provide great views of the outside of the palace. Most of the interior is restoration since the place suffered mightily in WWII."

Firstly I would recommend travelling to Peterhof on the hydrofoil, not because it is cheaper and/or quicker but because it offers a different perspective of the city and its waterways. It also offers a relaxing waterborne journey.On arriving at the jetty there is a ticket office for the gardens - make sure you keep your ticket, you will need it to get back to the hydrofoil jetty for your return journey! We did not intend going into the palace so we only bought tickets for the gardens.The lower gardens are very extensive and really only leave time for the less extensive upper gardens. Both gardens have a plethora of fountains. For the lower gardens it is sensible to have the a somewhat systematic approach because their sheer size means you could spend a lot of time retracing your steps in an effort to see everything. We were delighted with the musical groups which are found playing at different points around the gardens. At the end of the path from the jetty we found a small group playing xylophones and at the Roman cascades a large group playing wind instruments resembling flugelhorns.The upper gardens are more formal (rather like those at French chateaux) and , of course, more fountains. There are superb views of the palace which complement those from the lower garden from which you see the front at the top of the slope on which it stands. On leaving the upper garden to re-enter the lower garden (to return to the hydrofoil) you will need your ticket!Our systematic approach led us to explore the eastern side of the lower garden, then the upper garden and to visit the western side of the lower garden on our way back to the jetty to take the hydrofoil. It was on this side of the garden that we found the Marly Palace - more a luxurious garden lodge than a palace. There is an entry fee payable at a smaller lodge 50 metres from the palace - it is well worth seeing. It has a large rectangular pond in front of it and a smaller one to its northern side - here we saw someone fishing and were lucky enough to see him land a sturgeon! From the Marly Palace we walked along the shore to return to the jetty.This was a great day out and quite a full day without going into the Peterhof Palace itself."

Really easy. Comfortable trip.You then buy tickets to the gardens at the dock as you get off the boat then walk up to the palace and buy tickets for palace entry inside. Worth every single cent. Divine, sublime and incredible!!We then wandered the gardens for 2 hours before the hydrofoil back to St. Petersburg.Well worth the money."

Since we could make adjustments to our guided tour we decided to skip Catherine's Palace and use most of that additional time at Peterhof Gardens. So we ended up spending about four hours inside Peterhof Gardens. This was an amazing visit and a wonderful decision on our part. We were able to take our time and visit as much of the gardens, buildings, fountains and grounds as we wished, without being rushed. We had stopped at a pie restaurant on the way to Peterhof and brought lunch with us, for a picnic lunch at Peterhof. There is a LOT to see at Peterhof and if you can arrange it, this is the way to go!P.S. Catherine's Palace is definitely an amazing and beautiful building. But Peterhof is distinctly different and unique and worth the extra time."

Unlike Catherine's Palace, you are not allowed to take pictures inside the palace and I found I liked that. I was just taking it all in, instead of trying to get pictures. And I didn't have other camera-crazy people standing around and bumping into each other. They keep you moving--don't want you lingering too long and you are closely watched as you move from room to room. You must check your coat and large bags, so don't take anything valuable in that you can't carry on your body. Our guide got us down below the fountains before they started up and I think that's a much better view, looking back up at the palace, than from the patio looking down at the fountains. I was pleased that the fountains were not turned off after the music, etc, was over. So everyone had plenty of time to get pictures and/or video. We had some free time and my husband and I walked around a part of the garden and were able to see a few other fountains. but we didn't have time to do the entire gardens. I could have spent the entire day there! A highlight of my Russia trip--maybe tied with the Hermitage for my favorite place!"

We went to Peterhof Palace in our own by taking the local bus, metro and hydrofoil. The hydrofoil dick was right across from the Hermitage Museum. The boat rude costs about $35 US and took about 35 minutes. We then paid $15 US to visit the lower gardens. If you want to visit the inside of the palace and other building, you pay extra. The grounds were wonderfully maintained. In early October, the weather was a bit cold. Thus, if you plan a visit this time of the year, make sure you have layered clothing. The fountains were open and adorned with many gold plated statues. The scenery was great and our strode on the garden grounds was very relaxing. We had coffee at the restaurant on site and spent a total of 3 hours there."

The palace is sumptuous, made to show the power from Russian Czars. peter The great was, as the name says, one of the most famous of them and you can see that in all the rooms, decoration, furniture and all objects. the garden is an attraction in itself.Peter seems to have good sense of humour and in some parts of the walk his guests could be surprised by a spurt of water from a hidden mechanism he ordered to be installed. Huge fountains with golden statues in the back yard and all over the place.Some Russians choose the place for wedding photos. We have seen one couple with family."

Matter of fact, it looks to me as if all these Baltic coastal areas are going to be prime visitor attractions for many years to come, a lot to see in this realm.  I could go on and on about St. Petersburg. We visited the Yusopov Palace, this is a wax replication of the famous Monk \"Rasputin\" being poisoned there. The area is loaded with palaces and castles most of which were turned into museums after the Bolshevik Revolution in 1918. You remember the revolution don't you, when the have nots took over from the haves, called communism today? No wonder the peasants were unhappy, it is hard to believe the extravagance that existed then while surrounded by poverty. Except, they don't admit to that bit of history today. St. Petersburg was built on the Neva River Delta by Peter the Great in 1703 and it became a rival to all the cultural centers in the world. In 1714 Peter moved the capital of Russia from Moscow to St. Petersburg. Incidentally, he named the city after the apostle not himself.We took a tour on the Neva River. Great. But when we visited the Great Palace, about an hours drive from St. Petersburg. It was Peter the Great's \"Peterhof Palace\". Absolutely beautiful. We were there when they fired up the many fountains, all at the same time, at 11:AM, to the accompaniment of \"The anthem of St. Petersburg\". It is the most beautiful palace or castle I've ever seen. And yes, all that gold is gold leaf. One will also find the associated Peter and Paul Cathedral on these palace grounds."

The grounds are extensive and fountains appear in all shapes and sizes, both formal and interactive (some of which the children will just love).

Getting back to the palace, the best way to go is by hydrofoil, even though it's not a hydrofoil as you probably know them. Don't break your neck to get to the fountain show at 11:00, it's nothing special other than just turning on the fountains which stay on for the rest of the day. The rooms inside are beautiful. Beware of the touring times. They are limited for non-Russians. We found it much less crowded to go to the 2nd touring time at 2:30pm. The line to get into the 1st touring time was way too long so we spent the time wandering around the grounds. The smaller houses/pavillions are interesting. Make sure you plan your potty breaks carefully, because bathrooms are scarce and far away from the main areas. They are clean, though. Not a lot of food places either.

The furniture is all the same period furniture but little of it original. The grounds and gardens are staggering in scope and beauty and the gold on display among the numerous fountains is amazing. If you visit St. Pete, it's worth a trip out of town to visit the summer palace of Peter. My only complaint with the place is the bottleneck created by requiring that virtually everything must be checked and not allowing sufficient space in the checked area to accommodate the overlapping crowds angering and leaving. It is pure chaos and really could be managed better with a little bit of thought by the property manager.If you found this review helpful, please check below."

It can also get quite hot inside so I suggest layering your clothing to accommodate for this. Queuing to enter is uncovered so be prepared if rainy. Worth it though."

Words and pictures truly don't do it justice - you really must see it. Your first glance at the Grand Palace, with its gardens and fountains, will be breathtaking.I would recommend allowing a day, if you have the time, to spend here. You will want to see the Grand Palace, Gardens, Fountains, and the other buildings - including the Marly Palace and Peterhof Hermitage - that are located here. Be aware that you will be charged separately for each attraction - a ticket for the Grand Palace, a ticket for the Gardens, a ticket for the Marly Palace. The ticketing system can make the visit quite expensive - though worth the money spent. It is also the reason I rated this Very Good rather than Excellent - quite honestly, I just got tired of paying to go into every single building. Would have preferred to pay more for an all-inclusive ticket.The fa\u00e7ade of the Grand Palace is beautiful and the interiors are lavish - in part because they had to be reconstructed after WWII. The gilded Ballroom, Painting Hall, Peter the Great's Study, and the Throne Room were favorites. If you are not on an organized tour, the audio guide is very helpful.After visiting the Grand Palace, do take the time to visit the Gardens and Fountains. They are beautiful - and you will feel as though you simply can't take enough photos of them and that the photos you do take will never do them justice. The grounds are extensive and it's lovely to just enjoy the walk. As you walk, you will see the other buildings located on the property - the Marly Palace, the Peterhof Hermitage and others.Dining options at Peterhof are limited which is important to know if you plan to spend the day here. There is a restaurant - it was located fairly far from the Grand Palace and difficult to find. We ate at one of the many stands that offered hot dogs and hamburgers - and ate on a bench in the park.Peterhof was very easy to get to from St. Petersburg. We took the hydrofoil which leaves every half hour from right in front of The Hermitage. It is a 40 minute ride on the Neva River and will drop you off right at the dock at Peterhof - which is a 5-10 minute walk to the Grand Palace. If you buy a round trip ticket, it is less expensive.Visiting Peterhof, like visiting Catherine's Palace, really gives you a sense of how lavish and opulent the tastes and lifestyles of the Russian Tsars were and, as a result, provides some context to understanding the history of the country. It was definitely a highlight of our trip."

Out wonderful guide, Sergie, from Alla Tours was very helpful. The view from the look out over the bay is amazing. We later learned that Peters daughter redecorated, so very little remains of his original work is intact. Catherine's home is spectacular, the amber room is well worth the trip. Staff was very helpful in getting us to elevators and very nice wheelchair accessible bathroom. We learned that in WWII the Russian women buried the statues, so many survived. Others were never found and replaced with replicas. Seeing the opulence, it is easy to see how this behavior of the Tsars sparked the revolution. So much money spent on luxury while others starved. The drive to Peterhof is a nice chance to see the Russian countryside. BTY the fee was covered by our tour fee."

It was easy to buy tickets although we needed cash (even though they displayed visa and mastercard signs). They also required the right amount - no change. This was a great way to arrive and we had plenty of time walking around the stunning gardens before the fountains started at 11am.Again we had to pay an entry ticket to the gardens (with cash) and from that point on every building or attraction required further payment with cash. So bring plenty if you want to see everything! We chose to go to the main palace next and had to buy tickets inside the main door. I think everyone else there was with a guide or big tour group so we had to fight our way in through the groups to get inside to buy tickets. We could not find a separate entrance from those not in a group. Our guide book had said get there early to avoid groups but this was not the case. The buildings shuts in the middle of the day which means a lot of people get there early.But once we got inside it was easy to buy the ticket and we were able to leave our bags in the cloakroom. Cameras are not allowed inside the main building.The building is simply stunning. Each room is more incredible than the next and all well worth seeing. There was a sign in English in each room which let us know what each room was. We didn't pay for the audio tour (500 roubles each) so can't tell you what it was like, We bought a book at the end of the tour in the shop which covers each room in detail which helped a lot.There are guides in each room who help keep the crowds moving and helped our small group of 4 get around the large tour groups.We then had a wonderful time in the gardens and played in all the trick fountains. The gardens are enormous and full of beautiful fountains. We walked around them for hours. I would recommend bringing a picnic lunch as the food options are expensive and reasonably limited.We had no trouble buying a return ticket for the hydrofoil which was discounted if we showed the first ticket and had a great trip back.Peterhof was a highlight of our time in St Petersburg.

This was the castle built in the circa 1750 for Elizabeth and later lived for over 30 years by Catherine the Great. It is gilded gilded gilded. These Tzarinas lived much too high on the hog considering the surrounding poverty of the vast majority of the people. The gardens are very elegant and have a distinctive flavor with numerous fountatins. We were here 5 days before the G-20 meeting hosted at the Peterhof by President Putin. Security was tight. There were grim faced ladies in each room ordering us around and swatting at us with batons if we got too close to a roped line. Still the beauty of the place rates it as a solid 5. No photos were allowed on the inside of the palace but outside was a different matter. We have attached a few of the building and gardens."

I would recommend a guide so you can get in early. Groups are limited in size due to humidity from people's bodies in the Chinese rooms. No stopping for very long, the room guards keep you moving along. Also no photos. Not sure if it was because of G20 or if that is the norm. Plan on spending at least an hour in the gardens."

The fountains sleep until 11am and wake up with the sound of the beautiful music of the city's anthem. This is the best moment to take a video shot of Samson - the central figure of the main cascade of the fountains. The tall streams of water are especially impressive when you realize that there are no pumps involved in this show. The water is thrown up only due to the forces of gravity since its is directed underground from the hills nearby. The sculptures of the fountains are covered with pure gold that has been recently renewed. This gold is so shiny that the sculptures look like brand new. The palace and gardens are located next to the Finnish Bay of the Baltic Sea and the view from the palace balcony towards the sea is just beautiful. I have been in Peterhof for the first time long time ago during the Soviet times and now the place looks much better after series of restorations. Must see."

The art work as so fantastic and there was so much to see that it was almost information overload. There was just so much to take in. Each room was beautifully decorated and some of the rooms so ornate that it made your eyes sore, trying to take everything in. It was an experience I would not have missed for anything in the world. I highly recommend The Hermitage to anyone who is thinking of going to St. Petersburg. The only downside of the tour was that we didn't have enough time to see and absorb everything. Our tour guide said that if we spent 2 minutes looking at each exhibit in The Hermitage, we would spend 8 years there! Unfortunately we only had a few hours. St. Petersburg is beautiful and The Hermitage is a once in a life time experience!"

We stayed for two days at the Bella Skye Hotel which we booked on line. We had gotten a 48 hour Copenhagen pass. Trip was easy by train to hotel. Although hotel is outside the city, commuting was relatively easy and breakfast and view were excellent at hotel. We enjoyed our stay in Copenhagen taking two canal rides free with pass and going to the Royal Palace and Tivoli. Dinner was very expensive. Be prepared to pay double to triple US prices. We took no tours in Copenhagen and found it very doable by maps and asking people directions who all were friendly and spoke English. It is amazing how many bicycle riders are in the city.This was our third cruise, Princess to Alaska, Azamara to Greece and Turkey, and then this cruise. We were a little nervous about returning to such a large ship since we enjoyed the intimacy of the Azamara and loved the dinners and free excellent wine. However, we really enjoyed the Emerald Princess. We had an oversized balcony, I think they are largest on floor 9 and ten, and we thought the room was well designed. We signed up for anytime dining, and that also worked out very well. A few nights we had to wait ten minutes but we were always able to get a table for two if we wanted it. We also think the balcony was well worth it since leaving Stockholm and sailing among the small picturesque islands was beautiful. We also thoroughly enjoyed the guest lecturer/historian who gave an insightful talk prior to each port. Overall I found the entertainment enjoyable and the Princess theater excellent.We like to do things on our own so signed up for no cruise tours. However, we knew we needed a tour in St. Petersburg so signed up for STP. Since they offered a package for other cities we used them for Stockholm and Helsinki as well. Our first stop was Oslo. One of the reasons we selected Princess was that it went to Oslo. I had been to Oslo 40 years earlier but my wife had never gone there. We managed to find the tourist office (not that easy) and bought a one day pass. Our first stop was Vigland Park to see the sculpture garden. I had missed this on an earlier visit and to my wife and myself, this was one of the highlights of the whole trip. Unbelievably beautiful setting and sensational sculptures. We then took a train to the ski jump. Train trip offered a great feel for the Oslo countryside. Unfortunately, there was over an hour wait to top of ski jump so we did not wait. I do not remember anyone mentioning this problem. We then headed back to Oslo and took the ferry to the islands with the museums. Please note there are two stops, and we were told you could walk between all the museums. Actually, it was a lengthy walk. I suggest to get off at the Kon Tiki museum which is also next to the polar expedition museum. I found these more interesting than the Viking museum.We then went to Aarhus the second largest city in Denmark. It was a pretty city. We went to a recreated old town which I found touristy and not that interesting. I would have liked to see some artisans actually doing crafts which did not exist. We then went to their modern art museum. There is a rainbow roof which is quite unusual and gives excellent views of the city, and the museum itself was good.Our next stop was Warnemunde. We decided not to get up very early to go to Berlin which is 3 hours away. From the people on our cruise who went, I heard mix reviews. Some just opted for transportation to Berlin and they felt they were not left off in the best part for touring. We enjoyed our walking tour of Warnemunde which is a nice seashore resort and then we took a local train to Rostock and saw a football match. Fun for us to be among all the local German fans.We next went to Stockholm, and since we had limited time opted for a STP tour. I would have liked to have done a little more than what was planned for us. We did go to the Wasa museum which is tourist site number one and the Town Hall very impressive and had about thirty minutes to browse around the old town. All was good but I think they could have included another stop. As mentioned earlier, leaving Stockholm was very impressive.Our next stop was Helsinki and again we had an STP tour. Unfortunately, it rained very hard most of the tour. I do not think Helsinki has that much to offer in a short period but nothing looks good in the rain. We never got off the bus at the open market since the rain caused the stalls to close. Our guide gave us an excellent feeling for life in Helsinki for a young person. There was also a modern church of interest.I felt STP did a good job for the two days in St. Petersburg. We were unlucky that it rained the first day. As a result we did not get to take the hydrofoil to Peterhof but took the bus instead. At Peterhof, we were scheduled to view the fountains and gardens but did not take the walk in the gardens to the sea since it was pouring. Lunch was not good the first day. Also, we spent a lot of time in traffic the first day and seemed to repeat our route too much. We also had a very long wait to get back to our boat through customs after the tour the first day. The second day was jam-packed and everything seemed to run much better. The weather cooperated, the palaces were amazing, and our guide did an excellent job guiding us through the Hermitage museum. Since our group was limited to 16, I felt we moved at a better pace and saw much more than some of the larger cruise boat tours. I appreciated the knowledge our guide had of both Russian and art history. I found the tours very informative. We also got to see the Russian subway which was very interesting.Our last stop was Talinn in Estonia. We decided to walk the small medieval city ourselves. We visited their historical museum which I thought was ok. The city was quaint and worth a stop.Overall, we had a delightful two weeks, got a feeling for many different cultures, and learned a lot. I think the Baltics are great for someone interested in art, history or boating. I think the Princess did a great job on arriving on time at each stop and departing the ship was very easy."

During World War II, Germany managed to occupy Peterhof, and Hitler was so happy, he apparently sent out invitations to the cream of the crop of the fascist world for a huge party to be held there. Understandably enough, as this one story goes, this irritated Stalin no end, who proceeded to bomb the heck out of it. The other story is that the occupying Germans destroyed it. Either way, what you see today is a 70 or so year old re-imagining----not even a re-creation---of what had been there before. So putting the building aside which is really a more recently built tourist attraction, what you have here is a pretty park, with a lot of fountains and secondary buildings. These fountains were not designed with the intricate artistry of, say the Italian fountains in Rome or Florence, but rather with particular attention to: a) how the squirting was directed, b) large size and c) gold statues. If this was downtown, sure: why not; but for a day trip, not worth it to me."

We had to do what some advised against - go on the weekend in the summer. We were glad we did. It was very crowded both inside the palaces and on the grounds. Foreign persons and tour groups can only enter the palace from 10:30-12:00 and again from 2:30-4:15 so we were obviously inside with hoards of tour groups and a few other foreigners. We got in line at 2:15 and it was not too busy. The line was 20 times longer when we left. There are stands with descriptions of each room in Russian and English. We enjoyed the time inside. It is over-the-top beautiful and fully restored.We also toured Monplaisir Palace which was also beautify and definitely worth the price of admission. Purchasing a ticket here, if you do not speak Russian, could be tricky. There are several options, different prices for foreigners and Russians, student discounts, 3 different venues, combination tickets, etc.. The price card on the wall was only in Russian and the sales person did not speak English. Be prepared by knowing the price of the ticket you want and pointing. I believe (but I could be wrong) that you are supposed to be in a group with a guide (assigned free at the entrance). We did not figure this out until we were inside and given a few glares when we lagged behind the groups that quickly were led through the rooms. This is about a 20 minute experience. You can drop back to an earlier group if you want more time. Worth the admission price just to look at the floors and other woodwork. It has a good website with virtual tours so you can get a preview and some history before the visit. We spend a long time just walking around the grounds. It was crowded but mostly with Russian families who were much more relaxed than the folks from the tour busses. We enjoyed the beautiful fountains, landscaping, snack bars and people watching and during this part of the visit we were glad we went on a sunny weekend in August."

The Grand Cascade with the Samson fountain, Greenhouse, Roman fountains, Cascade \"the Chessboard\", Amusement fountains ( oaklet, umbrella, bench), stunning view of the Gulf of Finland. I could have easily spent a full day just in the Lower Park! One of the most beautiful places I have ever seen!"

The waterfor the fountains is supplied by some natural springs that feed into a reservoir, and are then shipped by pipeline, without any motors approximately 31 miles to the Palaces. The water is turned on at 10:00 a.m. every morning and turned off at 7:00 p.m. You can see the fountain height increasing at 10:00 a.m. All the fountains and water features on the entire palace lands are supplied through this gravity and water pressure system. When you see a fountain going 35 feet into the air without any motor to propel it, well, that's spectacular engineering. The water is released into the Baltic Sea which incidentally is approximately 35% fresh water. The Palaces are worth a visit just for the water show."

The water flows from a lake (quite a distance seats) about 70 metres higher than the Palace and is gravity fed only only.A lot has been said of the Palace's use of golf and the many paintings and sculptures. Best to get there early in the morning to try to get ahead of the large tours.One bit of advice is not to leave your jacket in the cloak room as it will take quite a while to retrieve afterwards.It is very easy to take pictures and, if a sunny day, beautiful pics of the water fountains leading away from the Palace."

He personally designed the water system that feeds all the fountains. They are all done by gravity and can run all day. A little man comes out at the end of the day with the waterwheel key to turn them off at the end of the day while the national anthem blares loudly - it's all very Russian and pretty funny. Be sure to find a couple of the \"trick\" fountains, also designed by Peter. Also be sure to take a look at P-t-Gs little brick house down by the water. He really didn't like to live in palaces so he built himself a normal house and lots of workshops to fool around with all his projects. The plantings are lovely, the fountains are amazing, the woods and boulevards are serene: the whole experience is just wonderful. A total must-see."

We skipped the actual palace (only certain times are available for entrance to non-tour groups). We had a guide (who came with us) -its worth it if you can afford it. There's no signage or explanation, but the fountains are enjoyable without extra info. There are also some good sights and churches in the town (also where the guide came in handy). If you have time for only one excursion, this should be it (unless you have your heart set on seeing the amber room at Pushkin).

Any entries to palaces and museums are extra. We arrived just in time for the fountain start up on Saturday at 11 am to some fairly dreary Russian music. The fountains cascading down from the checkerboard terrace to the Gulf of Finland with gold statuary are fabulous. Initially there was a bit of a crush \u2013 with all the tourists gathering in the one place. However after the fountains started up the crowds gradually dispersed and it was all quite manageable.We didn\u2019t go into the main palace \u2013 first of all because photography isn\u2019t allowed, and secondly because we\u2019ve visited other sumptuous palaces in Europe and didn\u2019t think this would offer anything we haven\u2019t already seen.The parklands are beautiful \u2013 with some glorious water features. However, in many places there is a run-down feeling \u2013 especially some of the outlying buildings which are in very poor repair. Also, because of the captive audience you will be subjected to dreadful food concessions or very ordinary restaurants. My recommendation would be to pack a picnic, or wait till you return to St Petersburg to eat!"

Again a guide is excellent as you get a much richer experience touring the grounds with someone who knows that the Adam & Eve fountains are separated (so they can avoid temptation). We did not have a chance to wander into the palace and heard from friends who have been that it would have been worth it. Really was one of the highlights of our trip."

In the meantime, the opportunity to visit Peterhof was too good to pass up.Keeping the various palaces, museums, churches, etc. of SPB straight can be daunting. Finally, I understood that Peterhof is the complex of palaces and gardens originally begun by Peter the Great. Located at least 30 minutes outside the city, Peterhof sits on the shores of the Gulf of Finland. Approaching the main building, the \"upper gardens\" set a formal and quiet tone. These resemble a park with rows of tightly-trimmed trees, rather than fancy show gardens. The interior rooms form wave upon wave of glitz, gilt and glamour. Our guide provided excellent commentary, but my head was spinning from everything there was to see.Once outside behind the main building, we could see the \"lower gardens\" flow toward the gulf. Peter created a series of spectacular fountains that remain powered by gravity, rather than pumps. The engineering is remarkable, but the beauty of design is fantastic. You may enjoy the architecture and interior design the most. For us the highlight was the landscaping. Either way, there is plenty to knock your socks off at Peterhof."

The Peterhof itself is not as large as the Catherine Palace, but the restoration was beautiful. The Peterhof was bombed to bits with the German occupation of St Petersberg, so the work that has been carried out sine is spectacular. We went on a a Cunard arranged trip from the ship, but there are several companies that also arrange trips to this wonderful palace. the journey there was good too very interesting driving through all the Dachas( summer homes) passed down through families."

Unfortunately you cannot enter the palace without paying for the garden ticket first, so try to visit it on the same day if you can't afford a double visit to the park. It's one of their numerous money-making tricks, including extra payment to get permission to take photos inside the palace.It's opulent and beautiful and really gives you an idea of the glorious past of this city together with its oppression of its people to achieve this. The visit to the grotto is recommended (costs extra again) as it gives good background on how Peter the Great came up with the concept and engineering of the numerous fountains at Peterhof.You can get the \"rocket\" hydrofoil from/to Peterhof directly to/from the banks outside the Winter Palace.

The interiors are equally as breathtaking and have been restored to perfection. A must-see on a visit to St Petersburg!Top tip for wheelchair users:Just about every palace and museum in St Petersburg has the most beautifully restored parquet/inlaid floors and paper slippers/shoe covers are required to be worn by all visitors. Having hired a brand new wheelchair on board The Arcadia, we were (very fortunately) allowed to go around the Palaces because it had new, clean, light coloured wheels. People who had older, black rubber wheels on their chairs were being refused entry. You do not argue with Russian matriarchs working in Museums and Palaces!!! If you plan to visit with a wheelchair, I would highly recommend making some white towelling or cotton wheel covers that can be slipped on to protect the floor from being marked by your wheels.The beautiful gardens are easily accessible with gently sloping zig zag paths and the fountains - hundreds of them - must not be missed!The male staff were very helpful and allowed us to use the goods lift between floors in Peterhof, Catherine Palace and The Hermitage but there is generally little awareness/consideration for the needs of wheelchair users in smaller places and churches. Hope this helps!"

It's incredibly easy to get to Peterhof (take a hydrofoil from the Winter Palace), and as soon as the hydrofoil pulls up you know you're seeing something incredible. My husband and I debated using a guide for Peterhof for days, and we eventually decided why not, let's use a guide to see both Peterhof and Catherine's Palace (on different days). I'm so glad we did! It seemed that people who visited without a guide were wandering around aimlessly. To my knowledge there are no audioguides, and the rooms within the palace don't have information of any sort. We visited slightly later in the day (toured the palace around 3) and I think that was a good time for it. Most people travel in huge tour groups that are bussed in earlier, so when my husband, guide, and I were walking around it was as if we had the entire place to ourselves. The grounds are so beautiful and you can spend a day there easily. There are so many different fountains, pavilions, and other attractions to keep you occupied. This part of Peterhof you can certainly do on your own. Be mindful that there are separate tickets for each part of Peterhof. The lower park/fountains is the area that you walk through when you arrive at Peterhof from the hydrofoil, and then you get another ticket for the Grand Palace, and another ticket for any pavilions My guide had taken care of all our ticketing, but there were several tourists wandering around by themselves who came over and asked us where to get this ticket or that ticket. I recommend visiting Peterhof without hesitation! On a nice day, plan to hang around and wander the gardens more than usual. If the weather isn't cooperating, just seeing the palace is worth the trip. It truly is exquisite and if you're traveling to Saint Petersburg, this is a must. And again, while the grounds can certainly be done on your own, I without hesitation recommend getting a guide to truly appreciate the palace."

Which means that making the 11am \"Fountain Launch\" show is rather tight. Next time I would look at train options and get there a little earlier to get a good position.There is also a system of ticket buying for the Grand Palace which I still don't completely understand. Effectively, foreign tourists can only buy their entry tickets between 12 and 2, and then again from 4.15 until 6.30, with Russian locals and tour groups allowed in between. Not sure how they get their tickets, because they actually close the ticket booths from 2 till 4.15. A little confusing, but the end result, the tour through the Summer Palace, is spectacular and not to be missed.Food options a little disappointing though, so be prepared!"

I did, however, visit the beautiful Church attached to its left hand side. 400R for the pleasure and each visitor is required to wear the foot gloves (provided). I instantly felt as though it was a very special place. The interior is ornately decorated with gold and irrespective of language, it is easy to distinguish people/images in the beautiful art work- the last supper, Mary, the disciples, baptism in the river Jordan and so on. Because there was little information in English, I would have loved a separate guide or audio guide for this short visit (without having to obtain one for the whole attraction).Plenty of fast food, ice creams and drinks available.WEAR CLOSED SHOES-gravel paths make open toed shoes or sandals infuriating to wear.700R for mini train the whole way around, although if you're Russian it'll probably be cheaper!"

Even this early, after winter, the crowds made full enjoyment of the magnificent interiors difficult. I dread to imagine how crowded it must be in mid summer. Most visitors arrive in a party or join a tour at the palace. A good tip is to go with a small party, travelling in a minibus rather than a large coach party. Official guides , that you will get with a tour are an absolute must, as the depth of their knowledge is vast, and they can make it come alive. Being with a small party means that you can be more fluid and agile whilst progressing around the palace. You can book a tour with a small operator online before you leave home, so if you are going on a cruise take this option, rather than the cruise company's tour which will be twice as expensive, you will not need a visa as long as you are on a tour, this applies to all the others on the cruise itinery and will give you relief from trudging around with sixty people on a bus.The interiors are truly astounding, having been restored over the last thirty or forty years from the burnt out shells left behind by the Wermacht. The restoration has provided work on a huge scale by generations of craftsmen and is of superlative quality. If the congestion of the interior puts you off,the exterior with its magnificent fountains is just as opulent as the inside, and the gardens are vast offering the opportunity of a good walk. It was raining when we visited and even then the garden was inspiring with excellent photographic opportunities,incidentally photography is permitted inside which is refreshing.Despite the crowds it is well worth a visit and is uniquely beautiful."

            "review": "Very crowded, but beautiful. This attraction is about 30km away from the heart of St Petersburg, and the best way to enjoy the Peterhof as a free-and-easy tourist without catered transport is to take the marshrutka at least once, and the hydrofoil at least once. I took the marshrutka to the Peterhof (R70), and then after my visit took the Hydrofoil back to St Petersburg (R650 or R450 for students), however the reverse is entirely possible and equally recommended too.The marshrutka is a private numbered bus that goes a specific route and you pay the driver a fee in cash to go to a certain place on its route. I took the metro to Avtovo Metro station, got out and took the Marshrutka which took me directly to the Peterhof Upper Park (free).Take note that the correct Marshrutkas to take are numbered: 224, 300, 424, 424A. Look out for \"\u0424\u041e\u041d\u0422\u0410\u041d\u042b\" and \"\u041f\u0415\u0422\u0415\u0420\u0413\u041e\u0424\" on the bus to confirm, or tell the driver you're going towards \"Petergof Fontany\" - yes pronounce it THAT WAY.This may sound complicated - so why take the the Marshrutka one-way + hydrofoil one-way, over taking the hydrofoil both ways?! TWO REASONS - you pay much less and you get to see so much more.The platform at Avtovo station is considered one of the the most beautiful of them, with its ornate glass pillars and a mosaic dedicated to the Leningrad Blockade.Around the base of the dome in the hall, it says \"Eternal glory to the brave defenders of Leningrad who vindicated their city!\"Look out for the glass-cut columns at the platform. Physicists worked with artists to ensure that light that shone through the transparent glass cuttings were reflected within the facets without ever reaching the concrete pillars it was wrapped around, thereby effectively rendering the pillars invisible!Meanwhile, the benefits of the hydrofoil to/from the Peterhof is that you get to see the Gulf of Finland (and Finland itself from a distance), and convenience - you get delivered to a dock just behind the State Hermitage in St Petersburg where you probably will be staying.Now for the actual review of the Peterhof! If you took the Marshrutka like I did, you'll have to walk through the Upper Garden before finding the ticket booth to pay the entrance fee for the Lower Garden. The Upper Garden was decent and pretty, but can absolutely not be compared with the awesome beauty of the Lower Garden with all its gravity-powered fountains!Many museums within the Peterhof estate have different closing days, and in any case it's extremely expensive and time consuming to visit all the attractions in the Peterhof, as they all charge separate admission fees. If you have limited time or money, be sure to visit at least the Upper (free) and Lower Gardens (R450, or R250 for students), as well as the Grand Palace (R550, or R300 for students).Things to note:- For some reason, the Upper Garden (free) is towards the south, and the Lower Garden in the north - don't get confused!- The hydrofoil pier is at the northernmost tip of the Lower Garden - you cannot access the pier and take the hydrofoil without going through the Lower Garden and paying for its admission.- If you intend on taking the Hydrofoil to the Peterhof both ways (there and back), do not leave the gates of the Lower Park, as you will not be allowed any re-entry (this is also stated on the website). However certain sources say that the guards exercise discretion on this - I would not bank heavily on that! In any case, as the Lower Park is vastly superior to the free Upper Park, you won't miss much by remaining in the boundaries of the Lower Park since the other main attraction, the Grand Palace, is within the confines of the Lower Park."

We went to St Petersburg last year, and loved the experience, the friendly people, the history and especially the wonderful architecture. There was so much to see, but we felt we had barely scraped the surface, so when we had the opportunity to visit again this year, we jumped at the chance!We had an organised excursion to Peterhof, and travelled by coach to the palace returning later by hydrofoil.We explored the upper garden terraces first, which are formally laid out in front of the palace. Then we toured the palace itself - opulent ballrooms, exotic Chinese rooms, the spectacular white dining room, portraits and mirrors, gilded staircases and huge chandeliers - this really is a place of extravagant excesses !! The fountains and water features are switched on at 11am each day accompanied by classical music which is really rather impressive. There were crowds of tourists awaiting the magical moment where the fountains and waterfalls start their display, but that didn't spoil our visit, in fact the sense of anticipation added to our enjoyment!!The lower terraces, woodlands and sea front walkways were next on itinerary - we were here when the weather was extremely hot (31 C) so we enjoyed the shade of the trees and sea breezes - it was easy to understand why Peter loved this place and built his palace here.The journey back to St Petersburg was by hydrofoil - fast and very comfortable, and great for seeing the real St Petersburg. The locals were paddling and swimming in the River Neva and sunbathing on the river banks although we were told that the river was polluted and it was not recommended to bathe.The city is currently undergoing a huge regeneration programme, where all of the old concrete communist apartment blocks are beng replaced, the historical buildings are being repaired and restored, and major road and bridge maintenance works are being undertaken, mainly paid for by tourism revenues I think.St Petersburg is a magical place and well worth visiting if ever you get the opportunity."

The fountains, the sculptures, the buildings, and the gardens! We had only 2 hours to visit and it was not enough as there are museums to go to and in the summer different events take place in the gardens. I would even recommend to have a picnic here!It is a +30min drive from downtown St. Petersburg and the taxi might be expensive. Therefore I recommend to take a small fairy from downtown (The Neva river, right by the Heritage Museum) which takes half an hour and at the same time you get to enjoy the sea. We bought tickets for about 20 Euros per person there and back."

The inside is nauseatingly opulent, with gold caked on or dripping from almost every surface. It's a real tourist draw and is likely to be exceedingly crowded. The guards are a bit on the scary side, constantly yelling at tourists and tour guides alike.

As elsewhere in St Petersburg large queues build up of groups, if you are not in a group you can go to the front and enter as individuals. This can be hard to do for those of us brought up in queuing cultures. The house was destroyed in the war (actually by the Russians as the Germans occupied it) and completely rebuilt after. They did an amazing job of restoring one wing which is what you visit. You can see the damage done at an exhibition in the park. There are a couple of nice cafes in the park where you don't have to queue because they are so expensive. The inside of the castle is covered in gilt, but you are not allowed to take photos.

Having said that we wouldn't have missed this city even if we did have to fight the throngs.Peterhof is a magnificent palace with high ceilings, long corridors and gold leaf decoration. The many objects d'art are beautiful and don't forget to leave plenty of time for the gardens which are reminiscent of Versailles. We were in St. Petersburg for 2 days off a cruise ship and it was no where near enough even though we took a private car and guide. We used Hop On Hop Off in other places in order to save for what was for us the ghighlight of the trip. We weren't sorry.Definitely leave 3-4 hours for the Peterhof and try and take the boat in at least one direction if the weather is good.

There are a lot of tour groups especially from 10am and you could be stuck between groups when the palace interior is open from 10.30am onwards. I think the gardens and ground here are more gorgeous than Versailles and Schronbrunn Palace, both of which however have better interior."

            "review": "Good crowd control improves visit. This was our second visit to Peterhof. Visitors are not exactly welcomed by the stern-faced women who staff the various rooms, but at least, unlike at the Hermitage, crowds are controlled enough that you can actually see the rooms in the palace. The women will not let one group through until the group before them has exited each room. They are constantly admonishing the guides and asking for their badge numbers if anything doesn't suit them -- a bit of authority that goes to their heads -- so it's not exactly a happy place. You will be scolded quite literally if you THINK about touching anything. It is beautiful beyond words, however, and worth the time and effort required. The gardens and fountains are beyond gorgeous, and I wish I had not been on a guided tour and had had more time to spend there. We were on a bus tour and had limited time. The hydrofoil is probably better."

Peterof the Russian Versailles was the Palace of Peter the Great extended by his Granddaughter Empress Elizabeth and was the official residence of Nicholas 1st. It was destroyed during WWII but has been perfectly restored. The gardens are amazing and at 11am everyday the fountains are turned on and they are amazingly spectacular. The gardens are beautiful and are maintained extremely well. The cascading fountains are everywhere throughout the gardens. Photos are not allowed inside. This is to make you buy a book at the gift shop. This is not expensive but it would have been nice to have my own photos. Everywhere else in St Petersburg photos were allowed but there was a charge of 3 euros to take photos and 9 euros for videos. This was a nuisance and what the idea of it is I do not know. There is no airconditioning so be prepaired to be hot as the crowds are huge. There is a lot of walking and a lot of stairs. Supervision in all attractions is high with retired women watching everything you do. But St Petersburg was my favourite city in the Balkans, a joy to visit. Catherine's Palace as equally beautiful although more sparcely furnished than Peteroff. This Palace has been as equally well restored after also being destroyed in WWII. Our other attraction seen in St Petersburg was the Church on Spilled Blood. This Church as built on the site where Nicholas 1st was assassinated. It is amazing with the stunning array of mosaics on the life of Jesus I have ever seen. It also had a beautiful gold alter screen. It was a true delight to behold. This is in its original condition and perfect in every way. Our whole experience in St Petersburg will be a cherished memory for the rest of my life. I thoroughly recommend the city as a must see!!!"

This palace and surrounding gardens was built by orders of Peter the Great. The Palaces and gardens are referred to as the \"Russian Versailles\". It is recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. There is a good reason for this. The grounds are beautifully manicured and all the fountains are relaxing and amazing to watch. The most amazing thing is that there are no pumps running the fountains. It is all gravity and plumbing that create the pressure to shoot the water that comes from the natural springs in the Upper Gardens. We walked through all the gardens and saw all the fountains.We did not have time to go inside since we spent a few hours walking around the grounds since they were absolutely beautiful. If you want to see the inside as well you should plan a full day there.What a treat to see."

The best time to visit Peterhof is of course the summer season, when all the varied buildings in the park are open to visitors and the famous fountains are in operation. We were lucky to find golf cart tour service that we used in order to get a better appreciation of all the area and attractions. The downside of the tour it was that was in Russian.

One of its true gems from the Czarist times is the Peterhof Palace, designed and built for Peter the Great in the early 1700's. After his visit to France, he attempted to compete with Versailles, and although his palace is smaller, it is every bit as opulent. The highlight is, of course, the massive cultured gardens with many small palaces and fountains, and the canal running from the main palace's cascading fountains right out to the Baltic Sea. If you are impressed by golden sculptures, this place will blow you away! Because no electrical pumps are needed to pressurize the fountains (gravity does the work), the fountains run every day in the summer from 11 a.m. till closing (more frequently than Versailles!). This is a treasure of St. Petersburg not to be missed."

The ticket line took no more than 10 min, and we were boarded immediately, which was great. We were perplexed why they would only sell us one way tickets (with no explanation). We later realized why... The hydrofoil wasn't running on the return trip. When we returned to the pier around 4:30pm, it was closed up with no explanation, and the single security guard didn't speak English. A nice couple who were also touring gave us directions to the bus stop. Note, cash only for both the hydrofoil and the minibus. The bus was about a quarter of the price of the hydrofoil so a good value.You can buy tickets to the Lower Garden of Peterhof at the ferry pier upon arrival in the morning. Lines weren't too long and they accepted credit cards. The lower gardens are extensive and very interesting. We particularly enjoyed the fountains and waterways, some of which are very unusual, including a chessboard waterfall, a pyramid fountain, and numerous other fountains and landscaped gardens. For children, there are several trick fountains which spray water triggered by a hidden person, which our five year old child enjoyed. There are various WC's and ice cream / sandwich shops scattered throughout the park. It would take several hours to stroll around and see everything, so either budget time or pick and choose your sites. The main rooms of the palace were on a separate ticket and were restricted in terms of time of entrance. For foreigners (non Russians), a sign said that tickets went on sale from 2:30 - 4:15pm. People began queueing at 1pm, and we decided not to wait. We later stopped by around 3:30pm and the queue was relatively short. We waited 15 minutes and were able to get in. Credit cards are accepted. The tour is self guided, with no signs or materials in English. Museum staff are very strict -- no bags can be brought in over a certain size; coats must be left in the coatroom, and plastic slippers must be worn over shoes. You are not allowed to linger in a particular room - we were told to keep moving when we stopped to take in the sights. (We were also told not to sit on steps outside the palace when we paused to check our guide book.) That being said, the palace was lavishly decorated with incredible marble and wooden floors, sculpted plasters, and antique furniture and china sets. Considering the devastation of Peterhof in WWII, the renovation is incredible. The fountains behind the house are also amazing and worth a close look.As mentioned above, we took the minibus back to a Metro stop, and then continued via Metro to our hotel. Despite our confusion about the hydrofoil, it wasn't too difficult to return to the city in the end. We would recommend visiting, particularly on a nice day. The gardens would be difficult to enjoy in the rain."

We did not travel with a group so did not have an English speaking guide . For individual travellers would advise they buy a guide book before the tour. This is not necessarily easy to do as the shop is at the end of the tour!! We bought the guide book then. Better late than never. An other option is the audio guide which costs \u00a310 per person on top of admission charge. A bit steep."

We went by Hydrofoil from St. Petersburg to Peterhof, Its about 30miles out I think. It took just over 30 mins. Cost $ 25 each way.Just a little tip, as we were really stuck for time we took a banana etc and enjoyed a quick lunch on the Hydrofoil out as we had a packed day. It was a most relaxing trip. Comfortable seats and toilets on board. The golden fountains are totally amazing as is the building itself. They require you to put very light cloth slippers over your shoes, which they provide, to protect the wonderful floors.Again very crowded, hot and as the buildings are very old there is a lack of any air at times. Some rooms get clogged up and delays can happen. But its the most fantastic place. I understand the fountains don't operate all year round, ie Winter time, but do in the summer months. They add so much to the whole experience. One of the nicest places I've ever been."

We didn't get into the palace - it was incredibly busy and we spent so much time wandering around the gardens, we had to rush for the return ferry. Incidentally, the ferry is every 30 minutes, on the hour and half hour. Although there are several ferry companies, boats are very busy, get there in plenty of time. If the ferry is full, you can book your tickets and wait for the next one.The gardens are beautiful, with fountains and lakes scattered throughout. You can walk for miles, but don't notice as your attention is taken with the surroundings.There are lots of red squirrels and pigeons - they are pretty much tame and will come over to you for food if you sit down; the squirrels will actually come up and take food out of your hand.There are toilets located throughout the gardens, along with food and drink kiosks."

Lots of locals enjoying the beautiful gardens and grounds of Peterhof. We weren't thrilled with the separate admission fees for every building but still went in several. One very caring guide to Marly House made the visit special. Her obvious enthusiasm and love of Marly House was palpable. The palace visit was okay, but a bit rushed and controlled compared to other similar sites. One special event was the troop playing the single note horns (in a range of sizes to create an amazing sound) outside in the gardens. We went by hydrofoil from St. Petersburg ... nice way to get there. Just make sure it is open on the day you decide to go. Another group was sold the expensive hydrofoil ride only to get to Peterhof on a day when all the buildings were closed. Bad business for the hydrofoil company not to warn people of the closures."

Synonymous with an almost unbeleivably privledged lifestyle, literally beyond anything that a 18th century peasent, (or even 21st century office worker) could even dream about. It is a crowd puller no doubt; and because we knew this, we indicated to our guide that we only wanted to see the upper and lower gardens, leaving the Grand Palace and Monplaisir to another occaision. Indeed it is the gardens we were desperate to see. In fact, as it turned out, the great weather made this an excellent choice.Peterhof is situated about 18 miles from the centre of St Petersburg.Tickets purchased, we firstly made our way to the Upper gardens, passing the golden onion domes of the royal church. The upper gardens (free) reflect the french influence ; mathematically precise ponds with inch perfect statues, borders trimmed to perfection, and vast open walkways that led to beech hedge pathways.These gardens are attractive, mature and yet slighty clinical in structure.The garden in front of the house, facing the river is the zenith of opulence.Life size gilded statues adorn the fountains of this beatuiful cascade.Only when viewed from below , by the 1/4 mile long ornate canal, does one really take it in.Throughout the lower gardens there are \"Novelty or trickery fountains\"; mostly involving getting some unfortunate very wet - apparently Czar Peter was something of a practical joker - with an unlimited budget to do so.These fine gardens are not just novelty traps for the unwitting; ther are some beautiful floral displays and lovely walkways away from the coach party hordes.We spent some 3 hours here and it could easily have been 5 or 6. Our visit was early on a Friday, and there were already a number of brides being photographed in the picturesque landscape; i would image that on summer weekends the gardens would in some locations be very full. This was the highlight of St Petersburg for us. Unmissable gardens."

We followed tripadvisor advice and took the 10 am hydrofoil (650 r one-way), arriving at Peterhof in time to get our tickets into the grounds (450 r) and get through the gate to see the fountains begin at 11:00 am. As soon as the opening display concluded, we skipped the crowds thronging the main staircase and headed east (left if you're facing the palace with the docks behind you), going directly to Monplaisir, the small home that was Peter's actual residence. It was delightful as we were on our own--the crowds had gone to the Palace. We're not fond of crushes, so we basically ringed the park, seeing all the major sights except the interior of the Great Palace. The fountains, as everyone notes, are spectacular. In addition, though, one of the most interesting things was the outdoor photo exhibit behind the Marly Palace (basically almost as far to the end of the grounds as you can go), which showed the grounds, fountains, and palace, during and after the heart-breaking war damage. Powerful photos that made you appreciate the extent of the reconstruction. Even without going into the main palace, we spent an easy three hours on the grounds. We took the hydrofoil back to St. Petersburg (450 return, so 1150 rubles total--cash only, like most things in Russia). Wonderful experience all around!"

We visited here during a recent cruise aboard the Arcadia, and this trip had to be done in an organised party - we weren't allowed to explore on our own.Our tour group was allowed in before the museum opened to the public at 10.30am ...... along with other tour groups! Be warned, you may have to queue for a long time. If it rains, you can't take your umbrella inside (apparently), dripping water everywhere, so good idea to take a plastic bag if its raining to pop your umbrella into. You're also NOT allowed large bags, but a handbag is acceptable.Inside, there are so many objects to see - I understand 30,000 (though not sure if they're ALL out on show). Apparently spending 1 minute at each would take you 10 years! There are many, many opulent rooms, each one vast, with decorated ceilings, beautiful floors and even the doors. The main staircase is a wow!It was very hot in a lot of the rooms, with everyone wilting. Take a fan.We visited the gold room which I found disappointing. 2 groups are allowed at one time and a museum guide accompanies you. I was expecting royal jewels etc but displayed is a wealth of ancient gold jewellery from around the world, along with gifts presented to the royal family from India, China etc etc. There is nowhere to sit and rest here, though an occasional chair was to be found which was apparently for the guide! I sat down regardless, which wasn't noticed. It was hot down in these rooms and my husband felt quite faint at times. Most in our group said they hadn't enjoyed these rooms and preferred the general Hermitage/Palace rooms. Worth seeing, but I found it tedious.Back in the main museum I viewed artwork by Rembrandt and Leonardo da Vinci amongst other notable artists, and even took pictures of them (very strange we were able to photograph them)!I didn't remember all the guide said to us as there was sooo much to see, but I'm so glad I was able to visit a place I've thought about since my childhood.Warning ....... there were literally 1000's of visitors there, and became very, very crowded after 10.30am when the doors were opened to the public. If going on a visit, get there early!See my website http://balticcruise2013.weebly.com/ for my pictures (be warned, there's many to bore you)!Conclusion - you MUST visit the wonderful place!!!

I have never seen so much gold. Behind the palace there is a huge park. Great place for young kids to run around in. There are even some water fountains that they can play in. If you go here with young kids this is a great place to visit toward the end of the day when they need some run around time... instead of Shussshhhhing them in museums all day. The tour of the actual palace is Ok... it took forever because of all of the tourists. you can't just walk through quickly. It takes some time. My kids were VERY grumpy when we were done, it was packed and they are not allowed to touch anything. Behind the park here there is a ferry station. You can take a Hydrafoil boat/ferry to Hermitage museum.... The boat ride is about 30 mins long and is a nice break in the day to relax in some comfy chairs."

But make sure you give yourself enough time to enjoy both the palace and the gardens. The house probably takes about a half hour to 45 minutes, and it would be better with a tour guide so s/he can describe the rooms to you. The gardens can take a couple of hours, and they are nice to take at a leisurely stroll.In the palace, all visitors are given \"booties\" to wear so not to scuff up the floors. Then all are led up to the second floor (or first floor as called in Europe) and taken through the rooms along the front and back of the house but only in the center. Then, the tour ends in the bookstore and gift shop, of course. I suggest you use the bathroom here; otherwise, you will have to go back towards the parking lot and pay for the bathroom there.The palace is worth seeing. Many historians and architects painstakingly rebuilt these palaces from the ground up following the Great Patriotic War/World War II. These palaces of the tsars were nothing more than burned out shells in 1945.The gardens are immaculate. We arrived before 11am, and the fountains were not yet turned on. Suddenly music plays over loud speakers, and then the fountains in front of the palace come on, each set taking a turn. Had I known that I was going to see them turn on, I would have recorded it. Throughout the garden, there are several types of fountains. My favorite is the fountain of the bulldog chasing the three mallard ducks. It has sounds of ducks playing, too. This is a wishing fountain - get the coin on the duck or dog's back and you will have good luck. There are trick fountains children love to play on. And maybe dip your toes in the Gulf of Finland.And of course, if you are finished with your tour, you can purchase food at the stands between the parking lot and palace gate. The Russian pancakes are delicious! Then, take a stroll through the vendors to pick up a souvenir if you'd like.Even though the Russians disposed their tsars nearly 100 years ago, they still make sure to present them in the historical sites. This is one to see."

It is a good thing to see and very entertaining. The full experience of the fountains lasts around 15 minutes.

Then you walk behind the palace and are awe struck by the magnificence of the lower gardens! Nothing can prepare you for the brilliant, lustrous,palatial grandeur of what you see. We walked out to the Baltic sea and looked back toward Peterhoff. I'm glad we did. To see all of the fountains and know there are no pumps used to help the water flow is amazing. It's all gravitational flow. Would like to come back and spend more time in the surrounding area and see the town."

The Palace itself looked absolutely lovely but we could not face the thought of waiting in a huge line of people to go inside and it was very warm so cannot comment on the interior.We had a drink sitting outside the cafe/restaurant overlooking some nice gardens, it was very relaxing.Would recommend but perhaps if you have the facility to print tickets, to book your inside visit online to avoid the long queues."

However, the extensive grounds, with many other buildings, pavilions, guilded statuary and fountains every few yards, is very photogenic and even peaceful in parts. The view out across the Baltic sea makes a good resting spot.Tip: because photography is not allowed in many of St Petersburg's stately homes and museums, I purchased a 160 page, full colour book for 149 rubles (about $6 NZD) about the city and it's environs.

A beautiful ornate historical palace without a doubt but visiting here was the low point of our trip to Russia and the Baltic states. Peterhof is apparently officially \"closed\" to the general public on Mondays - but that is the day that they seem to take bookings for group visits. If there are several cruise ships in St Petersburg the Palace is overcrowded and unpleasant. When we visited it was raining heavily. You are not allowed to take umbrellas or coats in with you and these have to be checked in to the cloakrooms first - so there were hundreds of people standing in pouring rain waiting to shuffle in to start this process. There were no facilities for the disabled to wait under cover. The waiting time was lengthy we were told as as the Palace is \"closed\" there were fewer cloakroom staff on duty. You then have to queue to put on plastic overshoes. As another reviewer has said the room attendants do not let you linger and seem to be all powerful. You just have to keep moving along with the crowds. There now seems to be annoying new trend for some tourists to have to have their photo taken in front of the major interior furnishings & exhibits so this often limits your passing view. The worst part of the visit was re-visiting the cloakrooms to re-claim coats and umbrellas as you have to go in the same direction and through the same small doors and corridors as those coming in to start their cloakroom check-in. It was absolute chaos with multiple nationalities getting increasingly unpleasant and abusive, pushing and shoving - a solid mass of people being swept along. I lost my husband at one point in the process and then discovered that he had been helping an American tourist who was having a panic attack in the midst of the crowd. Our small cruise ship had arranged for us to have \"early entry\" and viewing before the main groups were allowed in (at additional cost) but this was never going to happen with the vast numbers pouring into the Palace. If anyone had a good experience that morning it would be a miracle."

Asked about tickets and were shunted off to the right. OK. Waited in another line to deposit the day packs, a second line to acquire and put on shoe protection, and finally a third line for entry into an anteroom. Where, of course, we were turned back for not having the tickets.So we trudge all the way back to one small, and somewhat hidden, ticket window where the lady refused to sell us tickets, pointing to a sign saying something to the effect that no foreigner tickets to be sold for the next hour.Long story short, a sympathetic supervisor who had just pointed us to the ticket window noticed our unusual combination of dejection and frustration and, with the aid of two other supervisors (at least others seemed to jump when they spoke), forced the ticket lady to issue tickets. Then, quite surprisingly, she bulled herself and us all the way to the front of the huge line to where we had earlier been turned back, said a few words, and we were in.We had to join a Russian speaking tour (English is foreign, remember?) but that was ok as we were entranced by the place itself. If not for the kindness (uncharacteristic of traditional Russia) of those supervisors I would have been forced to give only 1 or 2 stars here."

I can't say enough for them. Peter the Great had quite a home!But we got there before it opened on a weekday morning, and the lines to get into the main building were already going half way around the building. The estimated wait time to get inside was more than 2 hours at that point. We decided not to go in, because we didn't want to spend too much of our vacation waiting in a line. And people told us the next day that once they got in they really couldn't see much or get around without stepping on other tourists."

The palace is closed in afternoon from 12.30 to 2.30 . So take early cruise or 3pm one. The hydrofoil departs right from behind hermitage exit. There are 3 to 4 companies selling tickets. The journey takes just 30 minutes. Once you reach you buy ticket for gardens around 400 rubbles. Also you can book your return ticket . It takes min 3 hrs to see the palace including the palace. Then you see the beautiful fountains and beach. The palace has a long queue for buying tickets costing 550 rubbles per person. Then there is another line for going inside the palace. So if you are more than one stand separately in both lines to save time. The palace is worth seeing. Inside they have cloak room to put camera etc. no photography allowed. Rooms are beautiful. It takes 1 hour min to see all rooms. On exit the museum shop is superb. Once you come out again long walk back to the hydrofoil. The hydrofoil is dot on time so don't be late. Worth a visit."

Our tour guide said that this was very unusual, so your experience may be different. You will need to check your bags at the beginning of the tour. It seems well organized and our tour guide said there would be no problems (there weren't). Not that unlike Catherine's Palace, there is no photography whatsoever allowed inside Peterhof.TIP: If you need to visit the washroom prior to the interior tour, I suggest doing that prior to getting in line.

I was not disappointed in the beautiful palace that is Peterhoff. What I was disappointed About, was the huge crowd that had accompanied me. It was like being at Disneyland in California on the most Popular day of the summer. In the palace I could hardly move amongst the crowd. There were huge to her groups of Chinese and Germans and Russians each following a guy talking loudly. It was impossible to enjoy the palace. The Russian ladies who sat in each room scurried you along and didn't even let you finish the commentary On the handset before they pushed you out. It would make sense to charge you a combined price to see everything at the palace and the palace grounds. But remember this is Russia and nothing makes sense. You have to pay each time you entering new part of the parking palace. By the time you leave you spent at least $100. And that doesn't count the amount of money you spent to get there on the hydrofoil. Don't get me wrong, the palace was remarkable and so beautiful and I'm glad I saw it. But fighting the crowds was one horrible experience. Probably the most negative experience I had while in St. Petersburg. They really need to find a way to filter the people through the grounds in a more sensible manner. Having a combined ticket would help as well so that you only paid one time instead of five times. Someone in the tourist ministry of Russia needs to get on top of this. There are many things wrong with Peterhoff but the first thing is that they need a combined ticket so that you don't have to pay it every date second thing is that they need English translations at each part of the monument so that you can have some way of knowing what you're looking at. They also need to have a brochure at the gate so that you can actually tour yourself around instead of following a tour guide. that would keep the amount of large groups to a minimum. After spending a week in Russia I get the feeling that they don't like people walking around museums alone the preferred if you're in a large group with a turn. That's not the way I like to travel."

The water flow from higher to lower ground, is not obvious enough too understand by most who visit. This, as well as the magnificent gardens and the fountains themselves make Peterhof a must see if you are in the area."

Prepare to spend good 3+ hours if you wish to see all the features in the garden, more if you are planning on visiting the palace museum also."

I visited here in 1973 and my memory of this place was fantastic...well, 40 years later it's even better!!! The grounds and fountains just can not be described accurately and do it justice. Do yourself a favor and make sure that you get out by the fountains before 11AM so that you can experience the Russian National Anthem being played as the Fountains come to life.I learned some new things such as the Germans actually occupied this palace but never Leningrad known today as St. Petersburg. We even saw the german built bunkers on property. All in all this is one of the top sites in ll the world so don't miss it. BTW you can take a hydrofoil across the bay to The Hermitage which get's you right back into town."

Think on and surrounded by water when you think of St. Petersburg. Now imagine dignitaries in suits and elegant gowns. Among the many benches and river rock patches are hidden switches. Sit or step on one and the fountain rises around you. Oh, you didn't want to cool off right now?

We actually brought lunch onto the hydrofoil, so we were able to eat on our journey, giving us more time to tour the gardens at the Peterof. (NB: Restroom available on the hydrofoil.) It was a good plan. Our first look at the Peterof was from the water and docking area. It was a sunny day and there were lots of flowers in bloom...the palace and fountains could be seen in the distance....great photo spot! Our guide led us throuh the gardens and provided the details, history and many anecdotes (We used individual audio devices while touring). She also set a pace that kept us moving, but allowed for plenty of photos and even stops at a gift shop kiosk. (NB: They take rubles, euros, or dollars. No credit cards!) Seeing it with a guide made it feel much more relaxed...she made sure we didn't miss anything and that we knew what we were seeing. Although there were plenty of people there, it did not feel like it was overly crowded, the grounds are extensive and there was plenty of room. The gardens, fountains, and palace were beautiful and impressive, iIt seems like the kind of sight you could visit without a guide, but having a guide made our visit more informative and enjoyable."

I paid to see the museum, which was a bit of a waste. There is no information in English. I think they have tours that are included in the price, but if so, the English ones are infrequent. Although the building is beautifully ornate, for the price they charge for admission, I wouldn't recommend it without a tour being included."

The trees and plantings are magnificent. They were in full spring greenery with flowering dandelions in the grass plus tulips in their prime and magnificently pleached trees.

It is smaller and more intimate than the Winter Palace in St Petersberg. It is still very grand inside and the church at one end and the gloden spires at the othere are very impressive. You got to a more intimate view of how the rulers lived. I particularly liked the Chinese rooms. When we arrived the fountains were not turned on but during our tour they were and with all that gold and water it is a magnificant sight. Took a walk down to the Baltic and the looked back at the whole ball of wax - boy those folks really knew how to live. Just outside the gates there are a few touristy shops and I thought their prices were pretty keen - BUT - it was the start of the season. As you queue up you get hastled by \"sellers\""

We visited St Petersburg as part of a cruise; because of this we only had a limited amount of time to see the sights. We wanted to make the most of it and decided that the Peterhof palace and gardens were the place for us. Due to the fact that you need a visa to go it alone in Russia, we joined an excursion - along with the rest of the world so it felt. The palace is beautiful. The authorities have really taken care of it and the interiors and exteriors are well worth the entrance fee. We were lucky with the weather, a sunny blue sky certainly shows off the palace, fountains and gardens in their best light. There were even people dressed in costumes wandering about which added to the atmosphere - don't take photos of them unless you want to pay through the nose.In my opinion it is best to go as part of a tour as there no signs or information in English inside at all. Without the aide of our guide I would not have had a clue about who lived in these amazing rooms. The palace gets very busy... very busy. We were literally packed in to the rooms - shoulder to shoulder. Each group has to queue to get in to the next room. But I guess that there is no other way to see this and that it is a case of put up or shut up.It is a fantastic palace, but beware; there are no toilets inside the house til the end, you will be expected to cover your shoes with plastic over shoes, the rooms are about the same heat as a furnace and you are not permitted to take any drinks inside! As they say, forewarned is forearmed!"

I've therefore listed a few tips below to make the most out of your visit.- The quickest way there is by hydrofoil. It's easy to find (opposite the front of the Hermitage) and doesn't involve changing. However this is by far the most expensive. 1100rbls return or 650rbls for a single- If you go by hydrofoil you will be caught by all the people trying to sell you their tickets. We just went to the dock which already had a boat there and purchased a ticket from them.- If you want to be really organised, look at how many cruise ships are docked that day. You can guarantee lots of cruise ships means it will be busy!- If you have any interest in walking through the gardens, then go on a nice day! You could even bring food with you and stop and have a picnic.- You have to pay for the gardens and then again to get into the house. If you go by hydrofoil, you can't avoid the garden entrance fee, as you arrive at the bottom of the garden. So make the most of your ticket!It's an absolute must when in St Petersburg, we just enjoyed strolling around the gardens and wondering down paths which looked like dead ends but brought you out to amazing fountains."

The ticket box on the pier had most signage in Russian and it wasn't clear what our 450R entry fee was for. It ended up this was just for the garden, we paid another r550 for the palace. The fountains were turned on at 11 am, so we joined the throngs of people to watch that. Our mistake was to head to the palace straight from there. It was crowded with tour groups, only groups of about 50 let in at a time. To be honest, I could have missed the palace and not been disappointed. But the gardens, with spring flowers, green fields, fountains and statues was amazing. There was so much to see and enjoy there, it is huge. There were little golf buggies driving around but I'm not sure how you hire one. Most signage is in Russian, so makes it difficult if you don't have the language.

            "review": "My Favorite Day in Russia. I spent about a week in Russia, and the day I spent at Peterhof was my favorite. The complex is very large with lots to see including the palace, the fountains and various other buildings all over the grounds. The fountains are very impressive (they're what you see if most of the photos). At first, I was disappointed because I didn't see them when I entered, but they're behind the palace (FYI). The palace interior is extremely opulent. It'll be hard not to be impressed as you tour it.A few tips:1. The website isn't crystal clear on how to get there, but this is the route I took. I took the metro to Avtovo station. Once there, I crossed the street and took minibus 424. It's marked with the number and it has text on the side saying \"Peterhof\" and \"Fountains\" (yes, in Phoenician lettering, not Cyrillic). The minibuses are private and not the world's nicest so it feels a bit shady to get in, but it was fine. It dropped me off right at the gates of Peterhof. It was clear which stop has a palace in front of it, but the one downside to all of this is that the driver didn't speak English so it wasn't easy to ask, \"Is this my stop.\"2. Pay attention to the hours. I tried to get into the palace around noon, but I was told it was closed to foreigners until 2:30 PM.3. Just because it's spring, doesn't mean you'll see flowers. I went in early May, thinking things would be starting to bloom, but apparently Russian plants take their time and don't move as quickly as plants in the U.S. northeast. Leaves were back on the trees, but flowers hadn't bloomed and bushes were still leafless. To see the grounds in their full glory, I'd suggest going later in the year."

You'd better come here without any excursions because it's more interesting to discover everything by yourself. I was so impressed with the architecture of the palace, with the HUGE garden with thousands of trees and bushes, even with its squirrels which are very friendly :) if you visit St.Petersburg, Peterhof should also be included in your own \"must see\" list!p.s. do not forget to buy some snack for the squirrels!"

Beautiful interiors and park surrounding the palace, but unfortunately the whole exterior of the palace was covered by large sheets for reconstruction work. Since the palace is supposed to be very pretty, this was a sad fact to find out upon arrival. Entrance tickets to the park are very expensive with 500 rubles pp, and another 550 rubles pp for the palace. One of the more expensive places to visit (Catherine palace is half price!). All in all, worth going there but if you can, check whether reconstruction work is finished since the view will be better. Do not arrive by the expensive hydrafoil boat (650 rubles one way per person) since it is not really worth it. The view is not that amazing and you don't see the palace upon arrival at the dock. Restaurant Standard on the park grounds is really nice though, with good service, nice food and a beautiful view."

The Fountains have been restored and glimmer. I think there was one which I had seen which looked worn out but will eventually be restored in due time. There are NO pumps controlling this place; which is even more amazing. It wasn't overly crowded. Nothing can really prepare you for how lovely it is. The Floor is a checkered-pattern (at least for the biggest Fountain), and you can even go inside. My tour guide tricked me into grabbing a bowl of fake fruits in a room inside the Fountain (a prank), and I got squirted! You can see how the fountains run on the inside. It's very dark and a bit hard to walk through but still neat. One thing that made me giggle was this little fountain where fake dogs pranced around chasing a duck. It even made the noises of the ducks and the dogs. Kids played in a sprinkler nearby activated by a staff who would spray them randomly. We also checked out some surrounding buildings and got to see a lot of Russian culture. Some Russian people also followed us around because my tour guide was doing such a good job explaining everything (he spoke both Russian and in English for the sake of my boyfriend's parents). You can also buy souvenirs around the area. It's a great piece of Russian history and if you get the chance, DO IT!!! You won't regret it!!"

If we didn't have her I would have wasted so much time in amazement just staring at things and taking too many pictures. There is a LOT to see in St. Petersburg so make sure you take it in and keep moving. I am so glad we put the majority of our trip budget into a private tour in St. Petersburg. With all there is to see, the lines, and hoards of people, slackers, etc I can't imagine how much harder it would have been.

Getting there: Take the metro to AVTOVO\u2019 station (line 1 - red line); 27 rubles (54 pence) from any part of the metro system. Line 1 is the oldest metro line and has some beautiful stations; Avtovo is one of the best.Exit the station, cross the road to the minibuses opposite, the ones you want display the following signs \u2018\u0424\u041e\u041d\u0422\u0410\u041d\u042b\u2019 which means \u2018fountains\u2019. Note the minibus goes past the fountains, it is not the final destination, so make sure you let the driver know where you want to get off the bus, have Peterhof Fountains & \u0424\u041e\u041d\u0422\u0410\u041d\u042b on a piece of paper, (we don\u2019t speak Russian and it\u2019s unlikely you will be any clearer to the driver than they are to you). It cost 48 roubles (97 pence) each.When you get off the bus, instead of going straight in, turn back, cross the road and walk about 200 metres to an amazing church, well worth a look (St Peter and Pauls).Getting back we took the hydrofoil from within the Lower Park, 500 roubles each (circa \u00a310.00) which drops you off in St Petersburg close to the Hermitage. Note that if you are taking the Hydrofoil back and want to leave the lower park you need a ticket for readmission (not your admission ticket) or you may have to pay to get back in.Entry to the upper park is free; 300 roubles (circa \u00a36) to get into the lower park and then you pay to get into all of the other individual museums and buildings on the site. The Grand Palace costs 520 roubles (circa \u00a310.42). Note that on wet days some of the buildings do not open.A must are the over 150 fountains including over 60 in the Grand Cascade which are switched on to musical accompaniment at 11 AM each day. Note that the fountains only operate from May to mid-September; we were lucky and were there on the fountains final day. They are switched off to get them ready for winter; I understand the Parks still open and that when the fountains are off entry to both parks is freeThe palace is beautiful but you only have access to part, they move you through quite quickly and you are likely to be through in 1 to 11/2 hours.Most of the heritage sites including Peterhof Palace close on at least one day per week, some close for half days, usually the morning. Check before you travel!If you wanted to do everything it would take several days and cost a lot! But it is the most impressive site we visited while in St Petersburg and there are plenty of impressive sites to choose from."

The building itself was totally covered over. The only thing open was the Palace church, which was magnificent and a small museum which cost us 700 Rbls each. I hope this saves someone else from the same disappointment. I would suggest spending time at the Catherine Palace at Pushkin, which today anyway was open and was a lovely place to spend time.Apologies for giving this a \"terrible\" review - I had to give a fake rating to get my review accepted by trip advisor program.

There were numerous fountains of all sizes, statues, and sculptured flower gardens. Looking over the flower gardens, through the fountains, up to the palace sitting high on a knoll was outstanding. We were warned of pick pockets in this area especially while tourists were taking pictures."

The fountain switch-on at 11 is great, best viewed from the bottom level. The palace itself is interesting but very similar to Catherine's Palace. We had a limited time to see the fountains dotted about the garden, it is no too big to see most but you might have to get a move on if you want to see them all. Not sure if this Palace is open in the winter but if the fountains are not running it would not have the same wow factor."

Do what the locals do: don't bother going into the palace, but enjoy the grounds. They take several hours to enjoy. Be sure to walk by the Gulf of Finland, so that you can envision how Peter the Great entered the palace, with all the beautiful statues and waterfalls before him.We took the Metro (Avtovo station - it foretells the opulence!) and take a minibus. The trip on the minibus is neat: you get to see many of the Soviet-style housing projects en route and some of the newer, more upscale developments. To be honest with you, the outskirts of St. Petersburg remind me of Co-op City in the Bronx, or Forest Hills in Queens."

Peter built it, Elizabebeth the granddaughter renovated it and added much of the gold gilding and further renovation was done under Caherine the Great. Damage during WWII lead to major reconstruction. Today Peterhof is a UNESCO WORLD HERITAGE SITE. The Russian Baroque grand design was influenced by Versailles. No photos are allowed in Peterhof although I did see some people taking pictures on the sly.Security is all about and they did not seem friendly. Slipper bags to put over shoes are provided to those entering the palace.The major rooms are the Ballroom, Blue Dining Room and the Picture Hall. Much gold gilding of molding makes the rooms seem rich and opulent.The gardens are spectacular. Entrance to the gardens is an additional charge of about $18 US. The marble Grand Cascade is the focal point with the Statue of Samson in the central fountain. There are trick fountains which activate when you approach, sit down or touch something. The Sun foutain rotates once activated. People in period costumes walk about and pictures are available at a cost. Peterhof is about an hours bus ride from St. Petersburg. There is a hyrofoil which leaves from the Hermitage which will also take you there. A doubledecker bus leaves at the Baltic Train station. It is pay toilets only at the palace."

We opted to catch a hovercraft outside the Hermitage and not go as part of a guided tour, this proved to be a good idea as most tour guides rushed people through Peterhof, when there is so much to see.The jouney up the Neva river took about 30 minutes, it is also a nice way to see St Peterburg as well. When you arrive at Peterhof after a short walk you see the stunning palace through the gardens. The fountains were incredible and so many of them. The tour within Peterhof was interesting but so crowded with large tour groups and unhelpful staff. I was somewhat surprised to hear that the palace was largely destroyed during WWII, not by the invaders but by the Russians themselves to prevent the Germans occupying it. The external walls are all new although the contents and some internal walls are authentic.The grounds are extensive and was really nice to walk around. Located in the grounds was asuperb restaurant which served good food washed down with a couple of beers at reasonable prices. A trip to Peterhof was a great day out."

I have grown up in Peterhof, spent my childhood there, worked as English speaking guide and it was the first place where I took my Norwegian husband when we came to Russia this spring.This place must be visited by all tourists, especially those, who did not have such a luxury royalty like it used to be in Russia. This place includes over 20 palaces and their number is growing every year! Everybody wants to visit Great Palace, that is why lines for going in are so big, that it can be a nightmare to get there. So I strongly advise everybody to pay attention to smaller palaces, it is a lot of them even on the territory og the Lower Garden, for example \"Mon plaisir\", Peter the Great's favourite house just on the cost of the Gulf of Finland. \"Royal Baths\" is also an extremely interesting place. But my all favourite is \"Cottage Palace\" - the private residence that was built for the family of Nicolas the First. It is located in the Alexandtia park, so you can take one stop by buss, or to have a nice walking tour there. It was built in Gothis style in 19th century and is the only one that was preserved when Nazis bombed and destroyed the city, because they had hospital for soldiers there. It is an extremely cosy and nice place, where you feel yourself like at home, not like a big and cold Hermitage! Strongly recommended!!!The park and fountains are amazing! Versailles is nothing in comparison with that, Peterhof's fountains are working every day during the season, from mourning til night, with amazing musical opening ceremony! A lot of gold and splendour!The prices for food and souvenirs there are very high, but this is a tourist attraction, so people pay these money, that is why prices are made like this. And don't forget about pick pockets - it is a highly over crowded place, so no wonder that they make their job there!"

Though you have to pay a tourist fee that is the double than for locals. We visited the gardens and the Palace. This is such a beautiful place. We had nice weather.At the Palace, we were trap in the middle of a couple of big Japanese groups, so it was very crowded. Also, assistant people keep yelling at you, because you have to walk with the group, you cannot stop and look the place. So, my advice is to visit this palace in the afternoon where not that much groups are there. After of before visiting the Palace use restroom in this area because there are not too much restrooms in the compound. The gardens and the fountains are beautiful. When we were there Autumn was beginning and see the leaves in different shades of brown was beautiful.Outside the gardens is located the Church of Peter and Paul, and it is as beautiful as the Church of Spooling Blood, and no busy at all! If you leave the gardens you have to pay a ticket to come back, but if you show your boat card, you can come back for free."

Built as a serious competitor to Versailles, as are the other two main palaces of St Petersburg, the Peterhof or Summer Palace stuns with its beautiful gardens, golden statues and opulent interiors. Approximately an hour's drive out of central St Peterburg, the palace sits on the Gulf of Finland and has extensive views of the water.We went in mid-summer to find huge crowds inside and out. Be prepared for noisy tour groups and the constant throng of people. Don't expect to be able to quietly contemplate the interiors or to sketch - the rush of pedestrian traffic is too great. At the entry, you are required to put on overshoes to assist in protecting the wonderful geometric parquetry floors - keep your eyes on the floors in every room.When gasping at the magnificence of this palace, essentially built by taxes levied on the serfs of Russia, consider the fact that the building was a burnt out ruin when German forces retreated in 1944. Rebuilding is nearly complete after 67 years though it is not possible to see any of the original structure. All of the wall panels and decoration were removed in the three months before the Germans arrived and so were able to be restored to their original positions.Overall, amazing."

As we entered Peterhof we were told no photographs could be taken (we obeyed this rule but many people didn't), we were disappointed to be told this only when we got there. Also we had headsets on but our Guide's microphone batteries went dead and she had to speak without this aid. As we were at the back of a group we couldn't hear her as the group behind were being spoken to by their French Guide and all we could hear was her so this spoilt our time there. The rooms again were incredible but we had probably seen too much 'incredible' that day. We absolutely loved the gardens and would have liked to have spent more time there (even in the rain) but our Guide rushed us through and we had to keep running to catch up. There was some confusion as we arrived as people were having to leave larger handbags and coats in an open cloakroom area. There were attendants there but it wasn't very safe and there were queues to do this. We were also supposed to get time at the end to visit the shop but we didn't. Most of these faults were to do with our tour guide not Peterhof. So am amazing place to see but maybe not 2 Palaces in one day. The staff inside were a bit grumpy, I was told off for holding onto a handrail going up stairs!"

We enjoyed the interesting bus ride out to Peterhof, as our local city guide was very informative about St. Petersburg, its history, the Siege, buildings we passed by, Peter the Great and the history of the palaces close by. Once we arrived at Peterhof it was an absolute zoo! There were dozens and dozens of big buses jostling for position in the coach park, as this was the busiest weekend of the summer season when 13 cruise ships were docked in St Petersburg, and all of their tours seemed to have descended on Peterhof at the same time! We only saw the outside the palace, the main fountains and gardens. So many people! Too much really! It's an incredibly popular place for Russians too, which is nice, but it really felt like all of Russia was at Peterhof that one afternoon! A few local residents told us that it's always busy and popular there in the summer! Take your umbrella and a light raincoat! Intermittent heavy showers kept occuring, which lent a magical air to see hundreds, if not thousands, of open umbrellas parade up and down the steps beside the Grand Cascade Fountain. The gold leaf everywhere is unbelievable, even more so to learn that it is re-applied every year to keep Peterhof sparkling and gleaming for tourists! If you're on a private tour, or travelling independently, I wonder if it's best to arrive at Peterhof as soon as it opens?? The view across the Gulf of Finland is nice to see, imagining Peter the Great sitting there, contemplating the progress of his Russian navy!"

Case in point: the Orangerie restaurant, recommended in a guidebook for its set lunch at mid-range cost, set us back $30 for two for a bowl of borscht, two small meat blinis, and one tea, for which milk was an extra cost. When we tried to visit the main palace, we wound up being directed to this other site--Catherine the Great's private apartment. For about $17 each, we got to tour 7 or so small rooms and watch a brief video in Russian.But for a kindly disposed security guard who made sure we didn't miss the upper gardens--she insisted they were free--i was ready to write off Peterhof as a poor experience. However, the fountains are an over-the-top sight, the grounds provide extensive, pleasant walks, and there happened to be a band playing for part of the afternoon on the grounds.If they could improve the signage, provide reasonable food options, and streamline pricing, I would recommend visiting. As it is, I suggest knowing in advance what sites you plan to visit, so you acquire your ticket(s) upon arrival, and don't face scheduling roadblocks at the palace, which is what thwarted us,Also, you can save huge by taking the minbus from the metro to Peterhof and back. The hydrofoil is expensive, and if there's fog as we experienced, you don't see much on the ride over. Not only is the metro fast and efficient, the station signs are in russian and english, and the minivan ride gives you a glimpse of suburban St. Petersburg."

We returned by bus (leaving the palace from the opposite side of the gardens). It's only about 300 meters from the palace to reach the street where you can catch a bus (70 rubles per person) which will take you (after some 40 minutes) to a subway station (26 rubles per person), from where you can reach downtown Saint Petersburg."

We visited on a lovely sunny day in July and the effort was well worth it.To avoid the problem of applying for a visa, we travelled on a cruise line tour, which was pricey but convenient. Of course this means all tour buses arrive at a similar time but our guide ensured we were first in the queue.

The care and attention to detail that Russian workers put into this place demonstrates their pride in this national treasure. And they should be proud. Golden statues, fountains, hedges, manicured gardens, beautiful buildings...We saw most of the lower gardens (paid entrance, accessed through main gate in upper gardens or by hydrofoil) and upper gardens (which are free and worth seeing, accessed by bus), and visited Peter the Great's cottage. We didn't see any other buildings, but that was enough. A person can only take so much grandeur in one day.I recommend taking the hydrofoils to the Summer Palace -- saves time, even if it is pricey, and is an experience in itself. There are about 3-4 companies who offer hydrofoils to the lower gardens. All of them have different prices. You'll find them along the Neva River, near the Hermitage, on both sides of the bridge."

I do not think anything can prepare you for the beauty that awaits when you reach the magnificant steps with it numerous fountains and gold statues which adorn the entrance to the house. Pictures on the internet do not do it justice, you have to view it for yourself. Walking through the garden it was amazing to think of the royalty whos house and gardens this was.If you visit St Petersburg you must visit Peterhof"

What amazed me was how different Russia was to what I expected, I expected KGB guards etc on every corner but St.Petersburg lifestyle was quite modern in all ways. The \"guards\" [ladies] in the Palace are a different thing! You get moved a long very quickly and God help you if you touch something, beside an alarm going off briefly she will shout a warning at you, which was funny in someways especially if 2 of you dared to even touch a rope. The palace is very nice [OTT] and even though we arrived early to see and hear the music when the fountains started it is a very busy place with photos being taken right in front of you even when you are also in the middle of photographing, most annoying. You need good walking shoes and after a while walking the grounds got to be a bit boring. Another thing I was really disappointed in was when we stopped for lunch in a \"summer palace\" which was gorgeous with lots of features however I learnt it was only built 3 years earlier, so photos deleted!! We went on a tour arranged by ship [Ocean Countess] and couldnt fault the trip, the Russian driver and guide were good and informative-especially when driver advised of free vodka/coffee in a souvenir shop! Dont usually drink vodka but it was nice. and after a few you forget you feet/leg/back/hip were killing you. Glad I did trip to St.Petersburg but wouldnt bother again. Peterhof palace is not suited for wheelchairs, people with mobility problems as there are so many steps/stairs. to climb. Fortunately it was adry day when we were there but wouldnt fancy walking the grounds in the rain and there's no shelters as soon."

Our tour guide has told us amazing stories about the history of the place and how it was built, and evolved through different rulers of the country, how much it suffered during the WWII and how long it took to restore. Walking around the gardens was an absolute pleasure; I could have spent hours wondering around and just enjoying the atmosphere. Make sure you do give it plenty of time, as there is so much to see, and unfortunately we had to rush and did not make it into smaller museums around the parks.

This is probably the easiest way of getting to Peterhof which is 60 Kms out from the city. It is a beautiful site. The process of ticketing, however, is complicated and expensive! Instead of selling tourists a single entry ticket to access all the buildings and gardens, you will be hit for a separate entry fee for every different area of the Palace which could add up to more than AUS $100 to see the whole site! Try to time your arrival to coincide with the \"turning on of the fountains\" - at 11.00 am in August (but times may vary). It is a special sight when there is a huge fanfare of classical music followed by the gradual operation of all the tiered fountains facing the impressive golden statues at the front, main entry to Peterhof. It isn't as grand as Versailles, but it is a wonderful way to start viewing this beautiful Palace. The Palace itself is outstanding and it is highly recommended to lease an Audio Guide (but you will need to leave a 2000 Ruble refundable deposit). Be prepared, however, to be inundated with hundreds of raucous tour groups all with their own guides shouting each other down - the noise level can get quite distracting at times. Like many churches, monasteries and palaces throughout Russia, photographs and video recordings are forbidden within the Palace but you can download internal photographs of the Palace from the Internet. The Palace is undergoing a huge restoration program which will be a work-in-progress for a long time yet. The extravagant Reception Hall and the State Rooms are truly spectacular. Also, the gardens are very extensive and serene. The bistro restaurant (on site) has nice food but might prove pricey for some people. Highly recommended!"

The admission to Peterhoff gardens is also around 12 Euros, but from 17h30 it is 50% less, however keep in mind that they turn off the fountains at 18h00 so you have 30 minutes to see the great Samson, and at 18h00 they play a nice music before turning off. If you want to see the summer palace and some small museums around it is better to come in the morning. back to the city you can take the same fast boat or mini vans (marshroutka) to the nearest metro (less than 2 Euro)."

Again, you pay 3 times more than the locals and in return you receive a photo forbidden and lack of any description in English! There are about 20 chambers but not overthrowing you on the knee.

The weather was awful literally pouring & we had to wait about 30 mins in the open air for the palace to open with the result that despite umbrellas etc we were pretty soaked through in quick time. That said this is a well worth visit. Inside, the palace is very ornate with much gilt in evidence particularly around the extravagant architraves on the internal doorways. Considering much of the palace was reduced to rubble during WWII an amazing restoration job has taken place. Wonderful wooden flooring with exotic designs has been fitted & because of this it is necessary for all visitors to wear plastic slip-ons over shoes to prevent any damage. Although the palace is wonderful inside it is perhaps for its gardens & very many fountains that it is famous. Unfortunately, during our visit there was as much water coming down from the sky as was going up in the air from the fountains. Surely, on a fine day this would be a truly memorable visit."

There's nothing quite like the splendour of the main fountains. The sight of all the gold, statues, and water is breathtaking.GETTING THERE: There are boats that leave just across from the Hermitage. They're quick, but more costly than other public transport. About 500 rubles, with some discounts for students/seniors.GETTING THERE CHEAPER: public transport to Peterhof is quite easy and can be done for under 100 rubles. Get to Metro AVTOVO (27 rubles for metro). Exit the metro (only 1 exit) and cross the street using the underpass. Look for the mini-bus loading area (70 rubles). There will be many going to Petehof. They will be labelled Peterhof or Fontanyi (\u041f\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0433\u043e\u0444 Fontany) and they usually have workers outside announcing \"Peterhof\" because they're so popular.Mini Buses to Peterhof from Metro Avotovo: 224, 300, 424, 424-AACROSS THE STREET: when the mini-bus drops you off at Peterhoff, you can walk about 5 minutes to see St Peter & Paul's Cathedral, another remarkable building. Then spend the rest of your day at the Peterhof Fountains and Gardens.....you won't regret it!TIP: make a day of it & bring a lunch. There is food available to buy there as well, and plenty of spots and benches to rest and have a snack.TIP: if you're an early bird, get there by 11:00h. This is when the fountains are officially turned on each day to some triumphant orchestral music!I suggest doing this experience on your own, not on a tour as I did my first time. The tours are more rushed & take away from the restful atmosphere of this beautiful spot."

We arrived at 10am, so had to wait till 12.You as foreign tourist have to pay more then domestic one. And at sales point there is no information, that entrance to Palace is only with guided tour in russian, so we didnt buy electrinic guide in english in advance. After all we didnt have time to get out and wait in all queues again to get it.We better went with russian group.

Peter the Great\u2019s desire to make Russia a sophisticated European power led to this baroque garden, inspired by Versailles and designed by a pupil of Jean-Baptiste Le Blond. Most say that this palace and gardens are better than what is found in France. Our Russian tour guide stated to us that all of her French clients concede this place trumps Versailles. We guess that says it all! It pays to have a Russian tour guide take you around the grounds. My husband and I made most of an afternoon at this delightful place. Having our Russian tour guide really helped us understand what was there. The 150+ fountains are beautiful and the buildings are unique, but knowing the background and history about them made it a thoroughly enjoyable and educational experience. An example of the benefits of having a guide was knowing the reason for the fantastic shower in one of the buildings. A second example was the trick fountain. She explained how it operated.Despite the throngs of tourists at Peterhof Palace and Garden, we felt relaxed. Maybe it was the backdrop of the Gulf of Finland or it could have been the 300 acres / 121 hectares grounds. Or was it the glorious fountains that are fed by underground springs? Whatever the reason(s), we spent more time here than at the incredible Hermitage.A massive restoration effort has made Peterhof Palace and Garden a \u201cMust See\u201d place while in the Saint Petersburg area.

Yes, the fountains are pretty but once you see one, it seems you've seen all of them. You have to pay to use most (or all?) restrooms. Seriously, is this 2012? Raise the ticket prices the same 25RUB and at least put up some free portapotties and add some trash bins for a real shocker. There are guards all around and don't you dare sit on the edge of a fountain. Visitors swarm the place unbearably on weekends. It takes a while to get there unless you use the hydrofoil. Avoid the Nevsky Prospect hawker tours unless you have good references from prior visitors."

The tour had the advantage that we were admitted into the Palace before the opening time for the general public. Although the Peterhof was concieved by Peter the Great and was built to rival the great palaces of Europe, what you see today all dates from 1945 and later as the Peterhof was destroyed by the Nazi's in the 2nd world war who used the palace as barracks. The walls are authentic but even a large portion of the roof and of course all the interior decor was destroyed during the war and restoration work is still in progress. There are however simply too many people allowed into the palace to allow you to appreciate the restored building. No photography is permitted inside and should you stop to view some particularly interesting item you are quickly ushered along by one of the many Russian ladies who stand by each internal door for this very purpose. When we left the Palace the queues of people waiting for the general opening streached as far as you could see!The gardens are really excellent and we were lucky to have a fine sunny day for our visit, we returned to St Petersburg via the hydrofoil."

Several tours that I looked at took you through the gardens at Peterhof, but, not inside. Make sure you find a guide who will take you inside. We used Ulko Tours and our tour guide, Mariana, was wonderful. She was knowledgeable about each room in the palace and the history of those that had lived there. The palace was very busy on the day we visited. Our guide purchased tickets for us, helped us with the coat check and finding restrooms as well as excellent commentary on what we were seeing. The restoration of the Peterhof Palace is beautiful. There are gift shops located in the beginning and at the end of the tour route. There were also vendors outside of Peterhof selling souvenirs they were carrying. We found the outside vendors to have fair prices. I purchased a \"Church of Our Savior on Spilled Blood\" wood box -- it wasn't really a box, but it played music, twirled and depicted in wood what the \"Church of Our Savior on Spilled Blood\" looks like -- for $25 US. It was selling for $50 US in the gift shops. We had lunch in the cafe at the Peterhof garden, with reservations having been made by Ulko Tours, and it was delicious -- 4 courses, and the service was wonderful. We walked through the gardens and fountains and then took the Hydrofoil back to The Hermitage to finish the rest of our tour of St. Petersburg."

Although I had been in St. Petersburg on business a few times before and had some limited sight seeing, I learnt so much more from Marianna.

            "review": "Fireworks, at High Noon?. For those not having visited Saint Petersburg and all its Romanov palaces personally, there might arise the problem of getting them confused. The answer to that is to remember, the Hermitage is green, Catherine's Palace is blue, and the Peterhof is gold (or maybe just bright yellow). The Russian tour guides will tell you that most of the weather in this northernmost Russian city is cloudy, damp, and cold for all but 30, seldom-consecutive days a year. We were blessed and congratulated on having ushered in two beautiful springtime days when we arrived a week into the month of May. Just two weeks before, the last of the winter's snow had melted. In direct reaction to this mostly intransigent climate, the Russians love color--bright and beautiful, often to the point of gaudy. Not just the palaces, but elsewhere, inside and out, lots of pastels, not to mention and inordinate fondness for gold leaf, colored marbles, and painted stucco.The Baroque Peterhof Palace is slightly older (1714-23) and slightly smaller than either Catherine's Rococo abode (1733-52) or the Winter Palace (Hermitage) in beautiful downtown Saint Petersburg. I read that somewhere. You'd never notice in actually visiting the place. In sheer acreage, the Peterhof trumps them all, and indeed, the site is as much known for its upper and lower gardens, its Grand Canal, its dozens of fountains, its monumental statuary, and a smattering of smaller palaces built by later monarchs, as for Peter the Great's imitation of Versailles. But, it was quite a step up from his first Saint Petersburg \"palace\" which was a log cabin overlooking the Neva (still preserved today).Inside, the Peterhof is much more varied and interesting than Catherine II's monotonous infatuation with gold leaf on white. There is some of that, to be sure, but the frequent use of other shades, reds, greens, blues, and rich, wood paneling adds depth and variety to the rooms, allowing them to exist as separate entities. Though the palace was undeniably a male bastion, the influence of Peter's second wife and heir to the throne, Catherine I is noticeable, though its difficult to separate the various eras represented in the interior accouterments. Later tsars, emperors, and empresses all left their mark inside and outside what was, in essence, the Romanov family estate, at least in the summer time.If the Grand Palace is fascinating for its rich decor and history, the grand gardens (my term) are nothing less than masterful, easily rivaling those of Versailles and virtually any other such royal indulgences anywhere in Europe. And, had they been in a more favorable climate, they might well be considered the most beautiful. The upper gardens are rigidly French, the lower gardens much more relaxed and informal with ponds, canals, fountains, and the riverside adding a pleasant aqueous element. Yet this was all part of the norm for 18th century imperial plantings, so much so that it's the surprising, humorous, and trivial that becomes the most memorable.Palatial visits are not for everyone. They represent only one aspect of Russian cultural history and one that can become almost sickeningly pretentious, extravagant, and overindulgent. In modern parlance, they represent how the \"two-percent\" of their time existed. The rest of the cultural heritage is presented by colorful Cossack dancing, babushka (Matryoshka) dolls, borscht, and picturesque horse-drawn sleighs gliding across broad, nighttime vistas of pristine show. Of course every country is prone to such generalizations and stereotypes. Tourists are both the cause and the victims of such trite displays of pride and prejudice. A whirlwind one or two day visit is far from enough time to cut through this pretty veil. Saint Petersburg is very much the essence of that veil.--A tip for those conte\ufeff\ufeffmplating a visit to Saint Petersburg: combine your visit to the Peterhof Palace with your visit to the Hermitage. The Russians have linked the two by high speed hydrofoil service almost doorstep to doorstep allowing effortless travel the considerable intervening distance. It runs from the Neva River entrance to he Hermitage to the a dock near the entrance to the Peterhof Grand Canal. You'll never experience a smoother, faster ride on/over the water anywhere. I noticed a girl applying lipstick as the craft skimmed along at 50 mph."

If you have time to take an excursion from St. Petersburg, this should be your choice. I took a boat from the front of the State Hermitage Museum to get to Peterhof. The price is reasonable and the trip takes 40 min. (There are other boats.) The main problem with Peterhof is the long line to get into the palace, and your ticket into the gardens won't get you into the palace. The optional recorded tour you can take is lengthy. Consider skipping some parts. Peterhof Palace and Gardens is a world class site."

The palace isn't huge (apparently only about 30 rooms) but the rooms are stunning. It's surprising to learn that this palace was largely and almost completely destroyed by the Germans in WWII and what we are seeing today is the result of massive restoration efforts for which Russia is to be commended. The site is now a UNESCO World Heritage site. Fortunately the sun shone for us the day we visited and the gorgeous fountains and beautiful gardens were simply magical. One great technological achievement of Peterhof is that all of the fountains operate without the use of pumps. At the entrance/exit to the Palace are lots of souvenir and food vendors. We were part of an organized tour so didn't have to worry about parking or lining up to get in."

These were all in full flow and what is more amazing is, as a previous writer commentated, they are gravity driven and with approx 200 individual fountains makes it even more amazing. Look for the fountains that are activated by human presence, designed to soak the indiviudals as they pass by. We were lucky, the day was sunny which certainly drew the crowds.We did not actually visit the palace but the walk around the gardens and viewing the fountains is worth the time."

It was quite a surprise to arrive by hydrofoil and then start queuing for tickets to the park. The ticket included only submission to the park, if you wanted to visit the buildings one had to buy a separate ticket for each place separately (there is no combination tickets awailable). However the gardens are very large and beautiful so there was plenty to see anyway and didn't even have time to go inside the buildings. We also took a train-ride inside the garden which proved to be a bit of a disappointment as it took us outside the gardens and not inside like we all thought.

This was sort of the Russian monarchy's answer to Versailles, a sort of gold-plated one-upmanship. Fantastic grounds, much more comfortable than Versailles' ominous orchards. It had a great deal of charm, especially the fountains that shoot out randomly. Kids will love those, and they should bring trunks and a towel. While they're at it, they can also run to take a dip in the Baltic. While it's not as warm as the Gulf of Mexico, it's sunnier and warmer than most California beaches. Plan on a lot of walking. Wear appropriate shoes with appropriate socks. This is not a day for fancy things or shortcuts. You will be hiking. We arrived by way of the \"Orienbaum\" train, stopping at the Novy Petergof stop. Other trains will go there - best to look pitiful on the boarding dock so a conductor will get you headed towards the right train. The ride out was bumpy, warm, and interesting from a world traveler perspective. If you would prefer something more than wooden seats and open-air cooling, then you should not take the train, you pampered sissypants. There are minibuses you can take from metro stations. If *that* isn't good enough for you, you could ride the hydrofoil both ways and pay double for admission. Beyond that, rent a helicopter, I don't know. I love train rides and sweating it out with the locals. I'm a he-man mountain trooper when it comes to that sort of thing.OK, so maybe I should have taken the shuttle from the Novy Petergof station to the Peterhof itself. It was a LONG walk, with little remarkable to see along the way and there aren't any directions on how to get there. The stupid Lonely Planet guide blithely assumed that not only would we get the right train (we almost didn't), but that we'd stroll along nicely to the Peterhof along some kind of yellow brick road. Kids, I'm here to tell you that the road isn't marked and we had to ask for directions along the way.On the plus side, walking there did give us a chance to have a moving experience at the Peter and Paul Cathedral, which I would not trade for all the world. If you're a religious person, you need to go there.Back to the grounds themselves. The upper garden, to the south of Peterhof, is free and has some delightful fountains and bushes bent to make arched arboral tunnels. Very romantic and fun! The catch is, if you want to see them, you'll have to arrive on the outside of the Peterhof. If you showed up by boat, you'll have to leave Peterhof and come back on bus or train. If you want to return by boat, you have to do it from inside the Peterhof grounds, and they don't have the concept of \"all-day access\" in Russia. Food on the grounds is either hot dogs and burgers from stalls or from pricey restaurants. Russia seems to be a land where food is fuel, so if you're holding out for culinary treats, you're in the wrong place. Just eat the \"grill dog\", it's relatively delicious and a good value. My wife says it was a really good dog, so there you go. It's not bad, that's for sure.If you're not into gold or fountains or taking a dip in the Baltic, then all that's left is the interior. I've already seen Versailles on the inside, so I opted out for Peterhof's version of lifestyles of the despotic and gaudy. As it was, the massive fountains were great fun and well worth the price of admission. We had an entire day at the cathedral and gardens... can't imagine what we'd have done if we tried to wedge in a palace tour.Note also that non-Russians have special times for tours. Be wary of that.The ride home on the hydrofoil was way more expensive than the ride up on the train, but we got to relax and not worry about which stop to get out at. We went straight back to the metro after that before our legs totally gave out. Great fun, but don't plan on anything else that day, mmmkay?"

The tour of Peterhof starts with the interior of the Palace and then you get a tour of the gardens and the fountains. The largest and most impressive fountain complex is the one right at the tourist exit of the Palace, but if you are early, there is no water yet. The fountains do not operate before 10:30 a.m. Instead of waiting, the guide may take you first to look at the other fountains at one end of the park. As soon as the fountains start to spout at 10:30 a.m. they walk back to look at these other fountains. We noticed that (I have been to Peterhof before) many guides do not take a path back to the main fountain, but walk at an angle in the direction of the quay to pick up the hydrofoil back to the city. So you will only see the main fountain complex, which by now will be operating at full strength, from quite a distance. It is actually just an extra 5-10 minutes extra walk to take a route going by the main fountain before going to the quay. But these Russian guides don\u2019t really care.In a country where the average salary is $1000/month, these guides pick up several dollars per person in tips from their 20-30 large tour groups daily. Some guide more than one tour a day. They look smug and the extra mile is not there.If you come on a later tour, there should be no problem. After completing the interior tour, the major fountain complex will be spouting water as you step out the castle, giving you a dazzlibng display. And you will be right there."

There are buses that are the cheaper option to get to Peterhof but why waste your time? You still have the Hermitage to tackle.The palace is best seen on a sunny day. The gardens are half of the attraction. The ticket does not include the church. The upper gardens are free but you may have to buy an another admission ticket to get back into the lower gardens and to get into the boat for St. Pete. There is some discussion of a way to get in and out without paying again but I did not pursue this avenue. There are also some grass areas that are forbidden to walk. There are security personnel with whistles to alert tourists to stay off. It is amusing to watch the befuddled tourists and it reminded me of a lifeguard at a swimming pool. The gardens are well kept and there are many places to find a quiet spot and have a picnic. There is also a cafe that has simple fast food items and a higher scale restaurant with some genuinely good food but expensive. Swimming is allowed by the docks of the boats. The palace itself is in good shape. There is no photography allowed inside the palace. There are also times when the palace only allows Russian tourists. This occurs about mid day. Plan accordingly and visit the Peterhof website before you go. Tour groups seem to be exempt from this policy and also get a direct entrance over the solo tourists. A tour is nice but then you don't have the time to wander around the gardens and eat at your own pace. As with most palaces in Europe there are strong influences of French and Italian style and art and architecture. During White Nights there will be hordes of tourists."

It was crowded, but as she did throughout our stay, Irina somehow got us close the front of the line. There were crowds throughout, so the guides could provide only limited commentary in each of the many spectacular rooms -- and they are truly spectacular. What impressed us most was the degree to which Peterhof was destroyed during World War II and the huge undertaking to restore as much of it as possible in the decades that followed. One's judgment of the Soviet system notwithstanding, the restoration is a great achievement and clearly a present-day source of Russian pride."

Walking through a beautiful alley, we arrived mid-way on the canal for a beautiful view of the Great Palace. After some time at the Samson Fountain and Great Cascade we headed around to the Upper Park. It is only from the front that you can see the enormity of the Great Palace! It was very interesting to view the exhibit of photos showing the palace & grounds in ruin after WWII. What an amazing job they have done in restoring things!

So its less crowded but we didn't get to loiter because of the other tours and each room has a \"watcher\" to be sure the line flows.The palace is very spectacular and the gardens even more so. Unfortunately during WWII the Germans either took or destroyed most of the art and furniture that was there. There are many buildings and gardens that you can purchase admission tickets separately. Look at their website. Also there is an occasional concert there so see if you can attend!We spent the early part of the afternoon in the lower garden strolling with the gorgeous fountains and flowers and then left about 2:30pm. So I didn't get to really stay and enjoy the garden or get to the other buildings but the tour guide was excellent. If you want a tour call Marina Wilson (see my review)."

But they are on then for hours so you can see it all except the first gushes if you wait and it is still stunning.The gardens are pleasant and some quite beautiful. Do not miss Mon Plaisir, Peter the Great's favourite and charmingly small \"palace\" cottage. It costs extra and numbers allowed in at one time are restricted, but it is quite the most intimate of all the palaces and during the World war II siege it was a Wehrmacht German army barber shop. The cottage lies next to the water of the Bay of Finland and the views around are lovely. The surrounding town is also charming but tour buses rush through it."

The Grand Cascade was an amazing experience with the sunlight reflecting off the golden statues and the rainbow lights in the largest fountain where Samson wrestled with the lion. I found,as always, that a book on the attraction was invaluable as this one had an excellent map and gave good historical information:particularly helpful when one has about three words in Russian. No success in entering palace: never did work out the entry system!"

Definitely do the Grotto visit as it was quite fun, eventhough the tour is only in Russian. The Grand Cascade is beautiful. A lot of the staff / ticket sellers do not speak English, so communication may be a little difficult. There isn't much to eat on the premises (but there are a few cafes), so consider bringing lunch with you. We stopped at Cafe Stolle on Nevskiy Prospekt on the way to the hydrofoil and bought pies for our lunch. There is a toilet inside the Grand Palace outside the ticketed area - so you could still go to the loo if you aren't going inside the palace itself (assuming there is no queue to get in to the palace of course) Definitely only go on a sunny/clear day - rain would make this day trip terrible.

We were picked up at our hotel, Novotel, in St. Petersburg at 9 am and arrived Peterhof Palace after 1.5 hours.Our tour guide accompanied us inside the museum. Pictures were not allowed. Jackets and backpacks were requested to be deposited in designated areas free of charge. We had to wear cloth slippers over our shoes to protect the wooden parquet flooring.It is better to go to the water closet (WC) after the tour of the museum due to the volume of people in private tours and cruise shore excursions.After the museum, we went outside the balcony and got the best view of Peterhof fountains. We walked to the gardens and saw the greenhouse. Everything in the garden was beautiful (fountains, trees, flowers). We spent a total of 2 hours in Peterhof Palace and gardens."

But it's not cheap: Separate tickets for hydrofoil from St. Petersburg, the garden grounds and the palace interior amounted to 2,000 rubles or about U.S. $62. But well worth it when you consider it's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for most people."

The many colourful rooms displayed the very best that old Russia had to offer. Each room we viewed was unique in design, colour and furniture. Well worth the hour or so that we spent in there. There is a nice souvenir shop in the palace, as well a string of souvenir \"shops\" closer to the bus parking area located a few hundred feet from the main site.Blaring music marked the opening of the impressive garden fountains, which I managed to get photos of amongst the throng of people. Quite a bit of walking and some stairs involved during the tour. Not sure if wheelchair access is available. Negatives of this tour were the large number of visitors that made basic things like restroom visits and cloakroom checks an ordeal. The ladies on our tour bus had to wait 15 minutes in line for the WC."

One of the things on the list is Peterhof Palace in St. Petersburg. They arranged for a taxi to pick us up from our hotel and take us there. It was a 40-minute drive from our hotel (Holiday Inn Moskovskiy). We arrived at about 10:20 a.m. and we realized it was perfect because they open the fountains at 11 a.m., so we were able to catch the spectacle. Then it was time for some decision-making. Tour the immense gardens or take a tour of the Grand Palace? We decided to tour the Grand Palace first. Not knowing any Russian and not having a local guide, we found it hard to figure out where to get tickets. This place has separate tickets for each museum in the complex (ticketing booths are situated near the museums). To get tickets for the Grand Palace, you need to get in line at the entrance of the palace. The ticket booths are inside. You can also rent equipment for an audio tour in English. The audio tour greatly helped us in making sense of all the rooms and exhibits in the palace. As we were coming out of the palace after our tour, we were surprised to see how long the line going to the palace has gotten in the hour or so that we were in there! It turned out that our decision to tour the palace first thing in the morning saved us a lot of precious time! We spent the rest of the day touring the gardens and taking pictures. Make sure you are wearing comfortable shoes --- the gardens are immense, but very beautiful! A leisurely pace is best to fully appreciate the wonders of the place. There are some trick fountains in the area and you may end up wet (not too pleasant in the cold), but it is a joy for the kids! Overall, it was wonderful and memorable. We can't stop looking at all the lovely pictures we took!"

Yes it is beautiful, the gardens are lovely the fountains are lovely, the palace and churches are beautiful BUT if you go there on your own (not with a tour/ tour guide) you may have to put most of the stars off the site. Getting a boat ticket is already not easy (people keep on pushing you from the back), getting on the hydrofoil is also not easy as there is literately nothing called \"quene\". The boat is around 30min.... Once you got your entrance ticket, you then realize that is not an all-u-can-eat-ticket. The site is under a pay-as-u-go ticket system ie wherever you go you still need another ticket, without any knowledge of Russian you probably dont know until you got rejected at the entrance.... If you are visiting the palace, be prepared to hear something like \u201cGo, DON\u2019T STOP, Go\u201d in a really rough tone - unfriendly staff. I heard someone asked the \u201cbabushka\u201d (the palace \u201cguard\u201d) why they then tell you something like \u201cclimate control\u201d. Apparently some of the rooms are so nicely decorated with wood panels and that any breathing may cause treasures to get rotten!!??.... No English sign/ interpretation, you are on your own...Buy a little guide book on the boat (they have also a small booklet in English for 100p, or better, get it at the bookstore (Singer House on the Nevsky Prospekt) before your trip, half of that price."

For this reason the entrance to the gardens was free. The interiors of the palace are beautiful, very similar to those from the Catherine's Palace. They are fully restored not only with russian style, but including chinese and french style. It is like seeing everything new with the splendor of past times. i hope to come back some day and visit this place during summer. I imagine that you will need more time to spend in the gardens, probably, but I think it is worth.We went there on our own. We were afraid that we were going to be lost. But at the end it was very easy to get there: Take de Line 1 of the subway towards AVTOVO, when you get there get out from the station and in front of the building take a shared taxi (# K224 or others) to Peterhof (60 RUB per person). The driver would tell you where to get off. The whole trip from the city centre last 1,5 hours."

It was heavily bombed in WW2 so not all the garden is restored but good enough to have fun. It's also amazing for children. Fountains are open from around May to September. You can go there by train, bus and boat. I'd recommend the boat at least one-way. Bus (unless it's tour one) and train - for those who either know Russian or familiar with Russian transport system."

Fountains are quite impressive, shining with gold and sparkling with water. This is a place not to miss on a visit to SPB. But plan for at least 2 days - just the garden will take half a day, and palaces are also worth seeing. There are many of them, but each has a long line of visitors, so be prepared.Upper garden is not in a very good state, so you can safely omit it from the visit schedule. With that decision, the best way to arrive is by hydrofoil departing from embankment across Exchange (Birja) building. Return the same way. After 14:30 tickets are discounted by 100 RUR each (regular price is 500).Peterhof offers also magnificent views of Finnish Bay and the city across the bay."

So I rode the Metro (subway) for twenty minutes and then hopped a mini-van for a thirty minute ride west of the city.Peter the Great (1682 \u2013 1725) built a home here on the shores of the Gulf of Finland to oversee the construction of his naval base. Eventually the area was developed with gracious white palaces, sculpted gardens, a series of dancing fountains and energetic cascades.Also called Peterhof, most of the original area was destroyed by both the Soviets and the Nazis. But the reconstruction is splendid. The weather is fine for my stroll and everyone is in a cheerful mood. I meet dozens and dozens of visitors - a lady from Uzbekistan dressed in native attire, a group from Brazil \u2013 the guide holding the familiar green flag, a few delightful local high school kids, and the ubiquitous camera carrying, fast afoot East Asians. At one spot, three Asian girls are posing for photos. I hear \u201cNeung, song, sam!\u201d This is the unmistakable \u201cOne, two, three\u201d in Thai. Naturally, I stop for a chat. With my broken Thai, and their excellent English, I learn that two of the girls are visiting a friend who is a university student here. The best event of the day was a musical surprise. On one of the garden paths, I encountered three Russian men and their percussion orchestra: xylophone, marimba, vibraphone. No Russian folk songs or jolly dances for these guys. It was all Vivaldi (Four Seasons), Bach (Toccata and Fugue) and Chopin (Nocturnes)! The lead player took the melodies, including all the grace notes and arpeggios. The second man added the base chords and the harmony. The third musician provided the tremolos and rhythms. The grand garden setting and the flow of the music was velvety and beguiling.For my final stop, just across the road from the entrance to the park, is the early Twentieth Century SS Peter and Paul Cathedral. The multi-colored brick exterior and the somber interior of the church lends a spiritual contrast to the splendor and extravagance of the Petrodvorits palaces."

It started early (opening) with a speed boat which took us from the embankment close to the Hermitage to Petershof palace. During the trip I prepared the visit with my guide,a experienced multi lingual Russian old lady I had hired through the Concierge of Kempisky . The hydrofoil trip was already a discovery and a fast and comfortable way to reach the place and be really concentrated on the subject : you have only one beautiful place to visit and discover.It is well organized and from the river you discover the Palace as well as its garden. It was not crowded and we could take the time to visit all the building and discover all the collections, walking in a beautiful garden from the palace, to pavilions, or chapels. It is impressive and I really enjoyed the company of the guide who really loved this place and knew about History and the side stories and also who could open, thanks to its accreditation, all the doors and all collections which were not all opened . In some parts of the palace it was as a private visit thanks to the guide.Taking our time and getting all the explanations, it took us nearly a whole day we stopped to have a light lunch (fast & efficient - reasonably priced) .It is not Versailles but on many a point it looks like and even some name are decisively French and related to Versailles. In fact it could also have been called Louishof..By the end of the visit we had some Sun and the view was even better and the trip back to St Petersburg a good way to keep an excellent souvenir of this visit."

We picked Peterhof in the end as it was recommended by a Russian and also it provides an opportunity for us to see beyond the city. We took a ferry to Peterhof and did enjoy our time there as the gardens are beautiful. The palace is very crowded so it leaves us with very little time and space to appreciate it. Have to be careful about which exit you took as the guards may not allow you in once you are out. Try another entrance if you are refused entry. The fountains are beautiful. The gardens is a must for exploration as there are a number of naughty hidden-staff who will 'shoot' water at you when you are engrossed in some exhibit in the gardens. Bring an umbrella as the weather at this place is very unpredictable. When it rains, it is really cold. Do remember to watch your timing for the last ferry back."

The one downside was when we bought a drink from a bar in the gardens we got ripped off, we were able to read the Russian alphabet and knew what price we should pay but they charged us extra, it was not worth trying to argue as clearly we could not speak Russian!I would highly recommend a visit to the Peterhof, we did not go into the palace but just thoroughly enjoyed walking the gardens taking photos, it was truly a lovely day."

Further, nothing is labeled, in Russian or English, so you won't understand or learn anything without a guide. We hired a personal guide and driver for a full day tour of both Peterhof and Catherine the Great's palace. It was pricey (~$475 for two people), but that included entrance fees, guide and driver and we felt we got a lot out of the personal tour. If you're looking for a private tour, I'd highly recommend St. Petersburg Tours. We went with Irina and she was great, with impeccable English!"

            "review": "I'm Glad I Went, But It Wasn't Essential. Peterhof was a huge testament to the seemingly limitless wealth of Russia\u2019s rulers. In retrospect, it's a demonstration of royal excess. The Russian rulers weren\u2019t satisfied with having a few palaces, so they kept building more and more. Even in Peterhof, Catherine the Great built a hermitage (translated, a \u201cretreat\u201d) so she could get away from the main palace, which itself was the summer vacation home from St. Petersburg. Seriously? You need a retreat from your retreat?Further on the theme of excess, the grounds were filled with manyt expensive-to-maintain developments: grassy areas, sculptured gardens, and lots and lots of fountains. If you\u2019re the ruler of Russia, how much time are you going to have to enjoy the bottom dozen least-interesting fountains at your summer home? I did like some of the whimsy on display in the fountains, such as the trick fountains and the dragons at a fountaintop.It's always funny to see the 18th and 19th century concept of \u201cnature,\u201d fully on display here. Nature was something to be managed, not to be left in its original state. Viewed from the modern perspective, Peterhof would have benefited if more land remained undeveloped and the attractions were consolidated more closely together.Much of the property has been nicely renovated after Nazi Germany looted and ransacked the place, but clearly it\u2019s a work-in-progress\u2014especially when compared with places like the Church of the Spilled Blood, which is positively gleaming after its comprehensive renovation.I lowered Peterhof\u2019s grade due to the oppressiveness of the multitudinous pay-as-you-go options. They really need to provide an all-you-can-eat option to enjoy everything at Peterhof, rather than nickel-and-diming people at many different minor attractions (which each required at least 2 people, the ticket seller and ticket-taker\u2014another example of the overstaffing problem).I also lowered the grade because different attractions were open and closed on different days. If you really wanted to enjoy everything, you have to select your visit day carefully. As it turned out, the Grand Palace was closed on Mondays, the day I went. I probably couldn\u2019t have rescheduled, but still, it pays to research the options in advance.I also couldn\u2019t tell if my ticket to the Lower Garden allowed me to exit, go to the Upper Gardens (and pay more), and then reenter the Lower Gardens so I could get back to the hydrofoil at the dock without paying another entrance fee. The ticket probably told me, but it was in Russian, and English-speaking help seemed scarcer here than in St. Petersburg. In all, I was a little baffled trying to navigate everything.Despite all this, I enjoyed walking around the Lower Gardens. The Grand Cascade was a sight to behold, even after the Vegas casinos have tried surpassing it nearly 3 centuries later. Even some of the lesser-celebrated fountains, such as the pyramid fountain and the Roman fountain, impressed me greatly. I also just liked walking around the less developed parts and seeing a bit of (cultivated) Russian landscapes. The views across the Gulf of Finland were nice, although I\u2019m sure it would be nicer on one of the rare sunny days.I took the hydrofoil to Peterhof from the dock right in front of the Hermitage. This was a nice way to see the city from the water and was a quick (35 minutes) and convenient way to get back and forth. However, it was an expensive option\u2014800 rubles (nearly $30) for the round-trip\u2014and if you can\u2019t exit and reenter the Lower Gardens for one fee, then taking the hydrofoil further limits your options. Considering the total costs, I\u2019m not sure the trip was a great value. Some friends recommended Pushkin, a different summer royal retreat, as an alternative. Its highlight\u2014a room covered completely by amber, even though it was recreated after Nazis looted the original\u2014sounds mighty nifty."

I don't remember much about the inside of the palace because photos were not allowed and it was less impressive when compared with Catherine Palace. The beauty of Summer Palace lies in its garden . A stroll in the garden will definitely take you longer hours than the time spent inside the palace (which is quite small). As I was with a group tour, there was limited time to spend inside the garden. I did not go to the sea side at the far end in front of the line of fountains but instead, walked down the stairs and turned right where there were more gardens (big and small) to explore. I returned by walking up the stairs on the slope and turned right. There was a road leading back to the entrance of the palace/garden. It was spatacular to see the lines of fountains and the golden statues glittering in the sunshine...and even more beautiful with colorful flowers in season. Going in late May is a good choice."

Once inside the palace it is very clear that independent foreign travellers are not accommodated at all - no audio guide, no guided tour and no signs in any language other than Russian. Audio guides and guided tours were provided to Russians.The Palace itself is over the top- the decorator must have been on drugs -if you've seen Versailles or any of the UK stately homes or castles don't bother paying the exorbitant entry fee here.If you do want to see inside the palace I would recommend going as part of an organised group - a shame as this is not my preferred travel style."

            "review": "Fabulous gardens. To be honest, it's the gardens that are the true star here, even though the palace itself is impressive. The sheer size of the place is a bit overwhelming, but it's interesting to see the various styles in the state rooms (from restrained neo-classicism to over-the-top baroque - the ballroom is a riot of gold leaf) and fantastical oriental-inspired rooms. After a while, though, the profusion of gold-leaf can get a bit oppressive.The gardens, though, and especially the grand cascade of fountains that lead down to them, are fantastic and worth a visit all on their own. We were only able to spend a short time in the gardens (spent too much time at other palaces!) and I know that we could have wandered around looking at the various fountains, houses, follies, and gazebos for hours. Even thought things are not quite in bloom, the size and scale of the planned gardens makes for a lovely walk--I can imagine how beautiful it is when things are blooming and fully-grown in mid-summer.Peterhof does get crowded, as most reviews have noted, and the crowds can be daunting and a turn-off if you are trying to really look at things. Every photo has dozens of people in it, and it's nearly impossible to pause and really appreciate thing without being buffeted by a tour group trying to move past. But, that's expected at such an attraction, and it doesn't really diminish the experience of looking at the palace rooms and gardens -- it becomes a party-like atmosphere as you descent to the lower gardens, especially if there are weddings going on (there were two when we arrived). Of particular note inside is the picture gallery room -- hundreds of paintings of women in various dresses and costumes. Well, it's mostly the same woman over and over, but the idea of \"wallpapering\" a room with various portraits to show that you had an artistic bent is interesting. I was most interested in the history of the palace, and the long process of restoring the nearly-destroyed palace after WWII. The palace was mostly bare down to the brick walls, with collapsed floors and looked more like a bombed-out shell than anything resembling the palace it is today -- the restoration work is immaculate, and at least some of the artwork and decorations are original (saved by being removed to Siberia--I think--before the city was taken). Not all the rooms are clear as to what is original and what is a reproduction, which can be a bit frustrating if you don't have a good guide to walk you through each of the rooms (and if you are interested in that sort of thing). Our guide told us that more rooms are open in the winter, when there are fewer crowds. Plastic/felt booties are required in the palace, and no photographs are allowed inside. A coatroom is provided to leave bulky coats and backpacks. I wish we'd had more time to walk through the gardens, and see the various other buildings, and I would definitely return to Peterhof to see other rooms within the palace when they are open. It's a fabulous day trip, well worth the effort and expense to tour from St Petersburg."

Even in the middle of May the gardens and palace were very busy and negotiating the lines and language barrier, if you don't speak Russian, was a little difficult. My husband and I managed it on our own, but on reflection we would have been better off taking a tour. Our trip involved finding and purchasing tickets for the hydrofoil, buying tickets for entry into the garden and buying more tickets for entry into the exhibits. The lines for the exhibit tours were very long and slow moving as almost no useful ticket information is posted in the ticket sales area leaving each person in line to try to ask their question to the ticket sales person. Tours in each language are at set times, the tickets for the tours are available at any time beforehand, but make sure you give yourself plenty of time to stand in line (I expect a guided tour would help avoid this little problem). Also, print a map of the palace and gardens to take with you as we were not able to find one on site. Having said that, the gardens were wonderful, we enjoyed ourselves just wondering around aimlessly. This palace complex really completes the triptych of opulence when combined with the Hermitage and Catherine Palace."

The roof was undergoing repairs, the fountains weren't running and I'm sure its a wonderful sight when they are but the gardens are massive, there are no sign posts, they don't give you a map and the only one's I found were either side of the palace but more round the front than on the park side. The only outbuilding in the park that I went to was some museum with the Chinese gardens but they wanted another 320 roubles to get in.Its expensive in comparison to the others 400 roubles entry and a crazy 500 roubles just to rent an audio guide! I didn't bother with the audio guide to find there is no information in English in any of the rooms. There's a lot of tour groups too so if you come here independently you've got to time it right. The treasury was another 300 roubles to get in too.Food wise they say there's lots in the grounds but I wouldn't have wanted to find them when I was hungry, lets put it that way.Having said all this, the golden statues are beautiful as are the two golden domed buildings either side of the palace. The gardens are nice & I'm sure much nicer when in full bloom.Its not a bad attraction but there are much better ones in St Peteresburg and I felt like they were ripping me off at every opportunity."

            "review": "A sight that you cannot miss. The easiest (and nicest) way to reach Peterhof is to take a hydrofoil from the pier in front of the Winter Palace. The earliest one leaves at 10:00 a.m.; the latest one back from Peterhof is about 5:30 p.m. The hydrofoil takes you across the Gulf of Finland in just 30 minutes and brings you right to the edge of the Lower Park of Peterhof. Peterhof is a Unesco World Heritage sight, primarily famous for its gardens, so I suggest you see the gardens first and foremost. When you enter the park (buy entrance tickets at the booking office at the exit from the pier), walk straight along the Sea Canal in the direction of the Great Palace (you will see it straight ahead on the top of the hill). Stop on the bridge closest to the palace to take a famous picture of the palace with the Great Cascade in front of it. The fountains of the Great Cascade start working exactly at 11:00 a.m. It is a beautiful ceremony accompanied by the music of the anthem of St Petersburg but expect the bridges across the canal and the area around the Great Cascade to be crowded with visitors who come to see it.The eastern part of the Lower Park is its most picturesque section, so if you stand facing the palace, turn left on the bridge and walk along the alley that continues down to the Adam Fountain with the marble sculpture of Adam. Continue down the alley till you come to the statue of Peter 1, and turn left to walk towards Peter\u2019s small Monplaisir Palace on the sea coast, passing the Sun Fountain on the right and an aviary (home to some exotic birds) on your left.Take a picture of the beautiful Monplaisir Garden with Monplaisir Palace in the background, and walk across the garden and through an arch in the palace building to come out onto the terrace with a nice sea view. Consider visiting Monplaisir Palace (Peter I\u2019s favorite) and the Royal Bathhouse (flanking the garden on one of its sides) featuring bathrooms of various kinds that Russian Empress Maria used in the 19th century.Walk back in the direction of Peter\u2019s statue; after you\u2019ve passed it, there are two \u201ctrick\u201d fountains on both sides of the alley that you walk through. You will easily spot them by the screams and laughter of the people stepping into the fountains and getting soaked as a result. These trick fountains are great fun on a nice day but cover your camera before you step into one of them.Continue down the same alley past two identical Roman Fountains on either side in the direction of Chess Hill Cascade. This section of the park is one of its most spectacular sights. Turn right when you reach Chess Hill and walk towards Triton Fountain. There is a self-service caf\u00e9 in the pinkish building next to the fountain \u2013it is nice to have a cup of coffee sitting outside on a fine day.There is a ramp next to Triton Fountain that will take you up the hill slope to the Great Palace; alternatively, you can continue down the alley as far as the Great Cascade to take a closer look at it, and then climb the staircase right to the palace entrance. The palace is normally overcrowded during the high season; join the line if you feel like visiting it and buy entrance tickets in the booking office inside (the one outside sells discounted tickets for Russian citizens only). No photography is allowed inside the palace but the gift shop downstairs sells all kinds of books, booklets, and postcards. If you want to see the most of Peterhof, save a whole day for your visit \u2013 it is definitely one of the must-see sights for anyone coming to St Petersburg."

When you think that the Hermitage in St Petersburg costs 350 roubles you get an idea of how overpiced it really is.What I found really furstrating though was that all the money that non-Russian speakers have to pay is not put into improving the facilities for those same visitors at the palace. While all Russians get a guided tour of the house included in their ticket price, we get nothing. There is no signage in any language, no tour available and the audiguide costs another 500 roubles! As such, we ended up wandering the rooms of the palace with no idea what we were looking at.There are a great many other palaces in St Petersburg which are just as impressive, less overpriced (although dual pricing for foreigners remains a problem) and have a great deal more information and explanation available to non-russian speakers.

We booked a return ticket because it was cheaper and we reckoned it would save queuing up twice. The crowds at the terminal outside the Heremitage were frightening. There were no orderly queues at all and it was a complete free for all. Tour groups which had booked in advance were given preference. Particularly obnoxious were a group of Spaniards who seemed to have at least 6 elbows each. Anyway, after missing one boat because we obviously did not have the right approach, we fought our way onto the next one and somehow managed to get a seat. Upon arrival, we bought our tickets at the jetty to get into the gardens. No problem.The gardens at Peterhof are absolutely marvellous, and in my opinion much superior to Versailles. We spent a lovely 4 hours or so wandering around the gardens and viewing the fountains. We had originally wanted to go into the palace, but the queue was about 1/2 kilometre long so we gave it a rain check. We also wanted to visit the fountains in the upper gardens, having approached by the lower gardens. We were obviously not the only ones with the same idea, and the lady at the gate connecting the lower gardens and the upper gardens had learned her lines off by heart \"No come back\". Translated, this meant that if we left the lower gardens to visit the upper gardens we would have to pay the admission fee again to get back into the lower gardens. Which we would have had to do, because the hydrofoil leaves from the jetty adjoining the lower gardens. So beware - if you want to see all the gardens and fountains, you have to choose to travel either there or back by bus, or pay to get in twice.  It is advisable to bring along your own refreshments, as the few refreshment stalls were very crowded. There is also a restaurant, but we waited for 20 minutes and no-one came to our table so we left again. (But it had the only clean toilet in the whole park) Nevertheless we had a lovely day and were glad that we made the trip."

Not scenic after a few minutes but gets you there without any traffic problems. When you arrive immediately go to the cabin and book your tickets for the reuturn trip at your desired time as that time slot could be sold out if you leave it to chance to book later. The gardens and outside of the place etc are very spetacular. Look for the trick fountains and visit one of the little palaces - Montplaisir\" was quite lovely. With time restaints we didn't get to the grotto or to visit the palace, so I can't comment on them . Peter's Verseille was very impressive though and worth the trip out."

            "review": "Gardens are Awesome; Palace Not so Much. I think that every reviewer comments about the gardens and the fountains. They are spectacular. No doubt about that. Well worth the time and money. The tour of the palace, at least as compared to the Winter Palace in St. Petersburg, I found a little disappointing and so I wouldn't recommend it. With the exception of the first few rooms, it was a bit mundane after awhile.A number of sources say that the boat trip from the Winter Palace is very scenic. I disagree, unless of course you find industrial sites along the shore scenic. That said, I still think the boat is a great way to get to Peterhof, just don't call it scenic.Some tips: * Try to have a map handy of the gardens. They are very large and it is easy to overlook some very impressive water features if you don't know they are there. We ended up taking a picture of an information board and constantly referred back to it to get our bearings.* If you go by boat, make sure you have a return ticket *before* you leave the lower gardens to see free upper gardens. If you don't, then you'll have to pay to see the lower gardens twice, which I suspect wouldn't be that cool."

Frst, you'll learn about the amazing mechanics of the Petergof's fountains (no pumps or hydromechanical devices at all - can you imagine that?!), and see parts of it with your own eyes. Next, you'll get a \"first-hand experience\" of Peter the Great's hillarious personality: the guide will make you test Peter's famous \"joking fountains\" on yourself. You won't forget that!"

            "review": "Magnificent Gardens & Beautiful Palace. We travelled out to Peterhof on the hydrofoil which departs from just outside the Winter Palace. This turned out to be a very quick and convenient way to travel without getting stuck in traffic.We didn't have a guide, but as we had only limited time available we decided to get a cycle rickshaw tour of the gardens. This was rather expensive but turned out to be a good investment as I doubt we would have been able to get around to the major sites in the time available without it. Luckily my wife speaks Russian and our driver was able to tell us a few interesting facts about the park and the palace. The only misgiving about the tour was that we had agreed on a price for a specific amount of time. Our rider was quite happy to go on after the agreed time obviously thinking that it would mean extra money. I called a halt to the tour as soon as I realised it and found that the asking price now was some 1,000 RUB more than had been agreed as the maximum up front.The garden is very well maintained and the fountains are all in working order. Some parts of the garden is quite impressive, particularly the area just below the palace. And some of the fountains are actually quite funny also.We also visited the palace. It was nice but by no means a must, so if you are on a tight budget or just don't have the time then it is not really a big deal if you give it a miss. The first problem was to find the correct entrance. We followed a sign that told us where the ticket office was only to find a closed door with lots of impatient Russians lined up outside. The sign outside told us in Russian that the palace was closed and was due to re-open in a little while. This turned out only to apply to Russian visitors and that the entrance was only for them. All foreigners were to use the \"entrance\" that was marked \"exit\" and for them the palace was actually still open. Probably makes sense to someone... I think the main reason for the strange arrangement and the obvious discrimination against the locals is simply that foreigner visitors are charged a much higher entrance fee.Inside the building we had to make our way to the entrance via the area where all big bags and coats had to be deposited. We were allowed to use our camera inside, however, no flash photography was permitted. We also had to put on some shoe covers for our stroll through the two palace floors.The trip around the palace took about 30 minutes, and we could probably have done it quicker if it wasn't for us stopping to take some photos.Peterhof is a good place to visit during the summer and at least the garden is a must for visitors to St. Petersburg. Not sure if the place is open during the winter, but can't really see that there will be much to see in the garden at that time as none of the fountains will be working and of course no flowers. The palace itself was fine, and I enjoyed the visit but would happily have given it a miss if necessary."

            "review": "Only one word: WOW!. What an extravagant display of royal wealth! Nevertheless, the best part of Peterhof is its enormous gardens and the hundreds of fountains. If you have only limited time available, see only the lower and upper gardens, as the palace itself is splendid by itself, but not a par to the magnificent gardens (not to mention the considerable higher cost to enter). Some tips for your visit:- Use the hydrofoils (700R pp) or the train to go there, don't use transfers by travel agencies, they cost considerably more.- Ticket prices are 300R for the lower gardens and 520R for the Palace.- Allow at least 5 hours for strolling the gardens, they are really immense! Don't be intimidated by their size, every corner is beautiful.- At Adam's fountain there is a small shop that rents nobility costumes for both men and women. It is great fun to wear one and stroll around, the pictures were priceless. Cost is 600R.- Get some snacks and water before you go, there aren't many places to buy them while you are there.Overall, Peterhof palace and gardens definitely worth a visit."

The fountains are superb and if you get a sunny day the grounds are a joy to walk around.Now the bad news - make sure you hang on to your belongings whenever in a crowd - I know it sounds silly, as most people are vigilant, but there are professional gangs out there who come to these places because they know visitors are easily distracted. This is what happened to me - we were in a crowd watching the fountains. There was some jostling as people tried to avoid getting wet, and within 5 seconds I realised my purse was missing! They really are that quick!If you want to avoid holiday misery then please make sure you take a bag which you can hold in front of you - no rucksacks or shoulder bags.I would recommend Peterhof to anyone, just beware of the scumbags who try to spoil your trip!"

            "review": "Spectacular Palace and Grounds. This palace and grounds were truly spectacular and should not be missed. We visited Peterhof on May 24, 2008 without a guide. We took a roundtrip hydrofoil trip (700 R per person) and left at 10AM. The hydrofoils leave near the dock across from the Hermitage Museum. The trip took about 30 minutes. Before entering the palace grounds we had to pay an entry fee (300 R). We walked up the path towards the palace we could see the fountains and they were just coming on for the day. They were lovely! We then wanted to see the palace and looked for a place to purchase tickets. A sign said to buy tickets inside but we already saw a queue. I decided to bypass the queue and go inside and find the place to buy tickets. The sign pointed to the right and I walked past two coat checks and the ticket window was in the last room before entering the tour. Tickets were 525R each. I walked back out to get my husband and we joined a tour just getting started. The palace was truly amazing and was made more special because alot of the furnishings and decorations were present. After the tour, we made our way to the front gardens to see the fountains. Just walk past the person monitoring the gate. You can get back in with your ticket you bought when you first entered the grounds. After reviewing the front gardens we came back into the main grounds and decided to see the trick fountains. If you are facing the palace from the main grounds, the trick fountains will be in the grounds to your left. The park is so lovely and the walk is very enjoyable as you discover the many fountains and gardens. There were some other buildings to tour but we opted not to. Hydrofoils leave every 30 minutes. I think the last hydrofoil left at 5:00PM but I am not certain. Check the schedule posted. Enjoy!"

The standard visit is 300 rubles for the lower gardens, but I wish I had also visited the upper gardens.Except in rough seas, take the half-hour hydrofoil. Note that the hydrofoil companies do not co-operate, and you must return on the one that sold you the ticket. Because tour groups get priority, independent travellers may be left on the quayside when a tour group takes a hydrofoil. For this reason, avoid the 5pm rush, and leave very early if you have to catch an evening show."

            "review": "Beautifully maintained, gaudy royal splendor. I had already been to several Petersburg area palaces, so I wasn't expecting to be as impressed by the extravagance of Peterhof as I was. The grounds are enormous, covered with dozens of paths, gilded buildings, flowers, trees, and fountains. O the fountains! Be sure you come here in the spring or summer when the fountains are running, because this is Peterhof's big claim to fame. And there are, indeed, fountains everywhere. Huge, complex structures featuring big muscly Greek Gods in absurdly dramatic poses. The buildings are impressive too, but the really pleasing part of visiting Peterhof is just to quietly stroll the wonderfully maintained grounds. This was probably the cleanest and best upkept place I've ever seen in all of Eastern Europe.My only big criticism is the cost. The admission tickets were VERY expensive (especially for foreigners). And they wouldn't discount the tickets at all even though we were students (students at a Russian university, no less). And I kicked myself for not bringing an extra roll of film. I needed to buy one while we were there, and of course this also was overpriced.I've heard that the bus to Peterhof from Petersburg follows a lovely route, but we took the hydrofoil and found it splendid. Clean, quick, and comfortable."
