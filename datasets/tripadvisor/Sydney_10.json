Shelley is one of the very few north facing beaches along the Sydney coastline, and is nicely protected from big waves or the southerly wind, so safe for kids. It has a lovely and lively cafe/restaurant (particularly on weekends) and is an easy walk from Manly along the beautiful waterfront. Or you could swim from Manly to Shelley if you are a decent swimmer, about 750m one way. Lots of fish to enjoy along the way if the water is clear, and in winter/spring time, look out further and you could see whales. There were quite a few breaching this morning, when I went for my regular swim this morning, magic!"

Sometimes the sea is a bit rough and it will be harder to see animals as they will be in hiding. Other times it is magical, I've seen cuttlefish, trigger fish, puffers, various rays, many fish I couldn't identify and even saw some (harmless to humans) blue whaler sharks. I really like it.I'm sorry the people above had a bad experience, but that can happen. I find people to be quite nice and once I lost a flipper (I went out when it was a bit too rough) and it was out on a fence where I could retrieve it 2 days later, someone had retrieved it for me when I was unable to. On good days it's magical. My goal is to see a sea dragon!In winter you can rent things like wet suits if you need it (the water is about 16c in the winter - but as you swim around there are warm spots in the water you can warm up in)."

Shelly Beach is approximately 15 minutes walk from Manly, but the main walking path was wiped out in severe storms in June 2016 and doubt it has been reinstated yet. We visited in March 2016 before the storms. The beach itself is a lovely sheltered spot and very popular. A wedding was taking place when we visited on a Friday afternoon. The beach is also the site of the very popular (and great) Boatshed restaurant which offered a wonderful range of drinks and food.Hopefully the walkway, toilets and interesting sculptures along the walkway will be reinstated, as if you are are visiting or staying at Manly, a walk to Shelly Beach on a sunny day really is a must do."

The beach is protected so the waves are generally not very big, making it ideal for small kids. There is a grass area behind the beach which is great for picnics or there is a restaurant and kook where you can buy snacks. The area is part of a marine reserve, so there is no fishing. This makes it good for snorkeling or scuba diving. If you don't feel like walking you can drive there and walk down. At the lookout it is only limited parking with a 2 hour max. There is a nice walking path around the point above the beach.Love Shelly Beach."

When I was first in Australia about 10 years ago I met a Canadian girl named Shelly on that beach and we had fun together. This time around I am much more mature and just enjoyed the scenery at the beach (limited as it was due to it being winter now but still some hardy types out here). In the summer it is a hopping good spot for adults/18+ as the evenings can get rowdy."

You can stop for a drink or meal at the Fairy bower cafe or finish with a swim at Shelly beach which is part of a marine reserve with few waves.

The sea is not very deep and there is nearly any currents at all (if any). Surrounded by enjoyable nature. Pretty popular beach for the locals but not many tourists - I think. If you want to get a nice spot make sure you`re early. Bring a towel!"

The most interesting aspect of Shelly beach is that its the only west facing beach on Australia's east coast and is filled with unique marine life such as the Eastern Blue Groper, the Weedy Sea Dragon, Gloomy Octopus and Little Penguin. The bay is popular for scuba diving and snorkelling because of its clear and shallow waters.  It is a very sheltered beach so it is especially safe for families and children. There is also plenty of facilities with toilets, cafes, & the now famous Boathouse Restaurant. If wanting to have breakfast or lunch it can get extremely busy so its best to arrive early.

The walk from Manly Beach to Shelly was beautiful, as well.Sadly, there is limited food and drink available there so bring whatever you want to consume, else you will have to go on walkabout to find something.One drawback - there's apparently limited parking there. We took the ferry to Manly from Sydney and then walked to Shelly, but the friends we were meeting were driving in.

Shelly Beach (also spelled Shelley Beach is a small beach on a tiny cove at the southern end of the more famous Manly Beach, in Sydney.I lived in Manly for many years and Shelly Beach was a favourite place for my wife and I to take our two kids, because it is protected on all sides, by North Head to the south on the landside, and a reef to the east on the seaboard.Many years ago I used to scuba dive and snorkel and can attest to the wonderful sea life just a few meters below, because this is a protected marine reserve and there are severe penalties for anyone caught fishing or spearfishing. There is also an old motor bike on the seabed in the middle of the cove in about 8 m. of water.Manly Council has installed two electric barbecues (open fire bbqs are dangerous because of the proximity of native bushland on North Head). With some friends we took advantage of these during my last visit back home in June.But we had to wait to throw our steaks and sausages on because the beach has become so popular that you sometimes have to queue for the barbecues.There are public toilets and showers. There is also a kiosk selling snacks, soft drinks and coffee.T"

On the walk itself, there is plenty to see - large water dragons, sunning themselves on the rocks, as well as small sculptures of the various forms of marine life. There is plenty of shallow water for small children to splash in, as well as deeper water further out which seemed to be the playground for the many groups of divers and snorkelers that we saw. There are some shady areas under the rocks that form the background to the sandy beach, so really, something for everyone. Then there's the restaurant, of course. This is a much better beach for children than the larger beaches of Manly and North and South Steyne, because of its sheltered position. Will be back."

It looks far at first but the walking track (footpath) has such beautiful views, you reach Shelly Beach before you know it. The kids love walking there, particularly at sunset. We have snorkeled there but advise against going into the water after heavy rainfall due to poor water quality (there are signs advising this as well). From Shelly to Nth Manly it is a great way to exercise and take in some of the best views Sydney has to offer. Highly recommend!!"

It is protected from the wind and the waves, so that the water is calm. It has a quite good restaurant, a kiosk and not much else. I consider it a better place to swim and relax because the water is calm and it is newer crowded as Manly beach can be, especially in the restricted areas where you can swim."

It's an awesome active place.But if you take the time to spend a day or two in Manly...or a week if you're wise, stroll over to nearby Shelly Beach. It's small, sheltered, the sand is course (Shelly Beach, shells, get it?), and their are no shops to speak of and a couple of restaurants. However, it's a calm, protected, friendly and inviting beach with children playing in the shallows, snorkelers near the rocks and divers heading out to the deeper edge. There are also a few jungle hikes of varying distances with great views. Don't miss these either.Manly beach is fun. Nothing wrong with it. Yet, you feel like an insider local if you spend a day or two and take in Shelly Beach."

It's not continuously windswept, the ocean water is not always freezing, the waves are not constantly trying to kill you nor is the marine life, although you do have the occasional shark. It's excellent for snorkelling and diving. On Sundays arvo the club Burning Manly organises fire shows, you can have a yummy BBQ and have a drink at the local watering hole, The Boat House.

Shelly Beach is also known as Cabbage Tree Bay which was named after the Cabbage Tree Palm. The most interesting aspect of Shelly beach is that its the only west facing beach on Australia's east coast and is filled with unique marine life such as the Eastern Blue Groper, the Weedy Sea Dragon, Gloomy Octopus and Little Penguin. The bay is popular for scuba diving and snorkelling because of its clear and shallow waters.  It is a very sheltered beach so it is especially safe for families and children. There is also plenty of facilities with toilets, cafes, & the now famous Boathouse Restaurant. The walk from Manly Life Saving Club to Shelly beach is very scenic & beautiful. A great place to take numerous photo's of Sydney's coastline."

You can see the surf rolling in at Manly as it faces back towards Manly but it's a very different beach. It's mosty calm, still water, perfect for snorkelling or swimming with younger children or people who aren't big on the waves. The snorkelling is amazing as the area is protected and there are so many fish. Just off the point there are some resident groper. The beach is picture perfect though and really enjoyable if you don't touch the water. We regularly walk there in winter and every time feel pleasantly surprised by its beauty.Shelly Beach is protected from the southerly and South-easterly winds and perfect when those are blowing. Don't venture there if a North-westerly is blowing though. It'll be far from picture perfect.Also, even though the water can be very calm, watch the little swimmers as the tide can have a bit of pull underneath.There is a new restaurant there which looks absolutely amazing and also takeaway coffee. I haven't tried the restaurant though so can't comment."

He said that Shelly Beach was more beautiful than anything they had in Europe. I agree. This is a sheltered location protected from the wind from everywhere but the north. The beach is deep with hills all around just beyond which lies the Pacific Ocean. The beach has no waves but there are plenty nearby and the constant movement ensures that the water at the beach is always clean. There is an OK restaurant and crappy takeaway nearby so you won't starve and fresh water and showers on the beach. Bringing you own food highly recommended for both price and quality reasons. If you come to Manly by ferry (the best way) you then have about 30 minutes level walk to get here. The views on the way are excellent and beaches everywhere to cool down. Don'r leave Sydney without a ferry trip to Manly and Shelly Beach."

Its popularity however is about to skyrocket with the opening of the Boathouse cafe/restaurant perched at the sand's edge. This is part of the small, really good Boathouse group of three restaurants on Sydney harbour. The crowds to get in are going to be enormous, fortunately it won't affect the beautiful beach area. You can of course drive to a car park above the beach, but the walk from Manly is so attractive, its part of the journey."

A bit of a walk to Manly beach, past lots more shops and restaurants, and often free entertainment on the promenade on the way. When you get to Manly beach at the end, you can turn right and walk toward the Lifesaver pavilion at the south end, around that and keep walking, you'll end up at Shelley beach. It is in a delightful little cove which is protected from direct ocean currents and winds, so a great place to sun and swim. There is a bit of a bush walk at the tip of it, and it you can brave that, you can take an amazing picture of almost all of Manly beach."

It was a nice walk around the cove from Manly, pausing at the rock swimming pool for a dip, looking up at the sweep of designer houses built into the cliffs, past the water dragons snoozing on the hot stone.However, as it was Sunday afternoon the beach itself was packed and there were a lot of families with small children. A bit of a shock after all the gorgeously empty beaches we'd been experiencing.If we'd known we would have taken snorkels, as there were lots of snorkelers. Plenty of paddle boarders too and even some people in a floating blow-up jacuzzi.It reminded us of a Mediterranean beach cove. As such it collected a bit of detritus in the water - again, we hadn't seen that before on Oz beaches.Perhaps it might have been a different experience if it had been midweek and therefore quieter. Good, safe swimming for young families. But if you don't want to elbow through the crowds in the water, if you want a peaceful spot to read or nap, it's not for you. Not on a Sunday afternoon anyway."

It is at Manly beach but right at the end of it on the right hand side you have a long walk but it is of course worth it. The water was warm and clear to see and if you have the water camera I can recommend you take it because you will get lots of beautiful photos of the fish here. Such a beautiful beach I am really going to miss this when I have to go back home to France!"

If you plan on visiting here then you MUST bring your snorkeling equipment. This place is a nursery for a lot of aquatic animals, you will see sting rays, giant snails, port jackson's, Grouper fish and much much more! A little tip, bring some food for yourselves as it can be quite a walk to get lunch as the beach-side bar is closed and being refurbished."

It is nothing spectacular in Sydney terms, and the snorkelling experience is a little barren from memory. If you're staying in Manly, or if you want to visit an accessible, (reasonably) unpolluted Sydney beach without surf, by all means go. If you're staying in the East and you want flat water\u2026try visiting Nielsen Park in Vaucluse\u2026it's a nice park and beach on the harbour - the bus goes here from the city - and there are also other things to do close by).If you want to visit the most beautiful beach in Sydney tho, seriously you need to get to Palm Beach (Summer Bay) (also PT accessible but a 1:20hr bus trip from the city). It's on a spit so you can have flat water or surf (and a round of golf) all in the one spot. And there are popular dining spots here too. Another good north side surf beach close to Manly (popular with Sydneysiders) is Freshwater. In the East, if you want to stay away from the hellish humanity overload of Bondi, or the pommy chaviness of Coogee, try Bronte (for cafes), Tamarama (for hotties) or Clovelly (for a tiny, cool, cove-like beach). For the South, I leave that to others to comment. There are a multitude of beaches in Sydney and there will be a nice one just about anywhere close to your digs. Don't be dumb and go out of your way to get to Shelly beach, it's not out of the ordinary special."

Its a smaller beach but the walk there from Manly is beyond words. Every corner turn reveals a new view. The beach itself is full of small tiny shells that make up sand. I have never seen sand like this before and it was nice to see something new. The water was great with no waves so we could actually swim without having to be pushed around by giant waves which is what happened in all the larger beaches we went to. I would highly recommend this place."

This is such a lovely time of day but there are throngs of people doing this walk with battalions of young mums with those big baby pushers. It is much more enjoyable in the afternoon and early evening. Perfect if you are actually staying in Manly. There are plenty of restaurants along the beachfront to choose from for a pleasant dinner."

The beach has a good kiosk for refreshment and bbq etc for picnics. Great calm beach for the kids and good, interesting snorkelling as its on a marine park.

My first dive at Manly's Shelly Beach in 10 years with my bud Salvo and found it a lot cleaner now that the old northern sewer tunnel takes Sydney's mess 3 ks out to sea. Great vis on the day and were lucky enough to see a couple of big rays and a bronze whaler.Unfortunately one of the many dive groups we saw on the day were chasing a leafy sea dragon around trying to get photos and were turning over rocks everywhere. The fish will come back now that the sewer has stopped so its well worth a look."

Shelly is quieter than Manly and due to the natural bay the water is usually calm.We rented flippers and snorkels at a nearby shop and spent hours in the water looking at the marine fauna. Initially, snorkelling made me feel panicky (something about constantly hearing your breathe rattle and wheeze down a small plastic pipe), but after a while it's just fun!Australia's wildlife is normal wildlife on steroids - so many fish in different shapes, sizes and colours. We even saw stingrays! Check out the info board at the entrance and see if you can get the species on their hitlist.PRO-TIP: It goes without saying that you're putting on suncream in Australia, but be extra careful when snorkelling. Your back is constantly exposed to the sun, so make sure you reapply every hour - or you'll burn like I did!"

The right side gets down to 10 or 12 metres and you can often see Woebegones and Port Jackson sharks there (totally harmless). There's always friendly Sydney Blue Groupers who want to play too. On the left side, the dive is shallower but has more diversity - giant cuttlefish, squid, and the occasional sea turtle or dusky whaler shark (again, harmless) join the regular crew. I've even seen stingrees, estuarine catfish and a motorcyle down there. For swimming and snorkelling this is a dream beach too not to mention paddleboards! Great place with great facilities."

The sharks tend to sleep under rocks in the daytime though so these are easier to see if you're scuba diving. The best places to go are on either side of the beach. The left side is my favourite where it is more rocky because there is more to see. The visibility tends to be quite good normally but I have been a couple of times when it's been choppy with a lot of sediment. There's a dive shop called divesydney (I think) which does scuba trips there at quite a good price, including night dives, which is really fun."

Shelly Beach is small and nothing spectacular but that is fine -- it is a quiet beach which is found at the end of a 10-15 minute totally enjoyable walk from Manly. Getting here is fairly simple -- get off of the ferry at Manly, ask for directions, walk about 2 long blocks to Manly beach passing many shops and restaurants along the way -- once at the beach boardwalk, turn right and take the walk until you bump into Shelly beach.Bring your own snorkeling gear -- we didn't find any outlets who sold or rented any. Or, forget the snorkeling and simply enjoy swimming and relaxing in this quiet spot. Bathroom - a decent bathroom is along the walk and not far from the beach.Dining - skip the restaurant at Shelly beach as it is a bit formal and stroll back to Manly and pick one of the many casual restaurants there."

Manly was crazy during the same period. Went snorkeling and literally 2 meters from the edge of the water were tons of fish. I don't know anything about fish, but there were striped fish, a school of probably 3-500 small silver ones, parrot fish, and a huge blue fish about 2 feet long. I did not go more than 50 meters from shore. Great for families and people who don't want to swim far from shore."

Tucked away at the end of the more popular Manly Beach is a delightful sheltered, sandy (well shelly, gritty) beach free from the waves that comes ashore on Manly itself and therefore free of surfers. It can therefore be used more when the waves are dumping onthe main beach. Being a kind of eddy, backwater it does attract floating creatures and jellyfish can be a problem. The snad being coarse doesn't make that good a sand castle but for the kids it is a gentle sloping entry to the water.Walking from Manly itself is just a mere 15 minutes and there is plenty to see and do with cafes should you so wish."

An interesting corner shop opposite my favourite cafe, The Bower, stocks the bounty of the owners' travels.Those wanting a longer walk, can take the path through the carpark and explore the Manly Scenic Walk.This is a part of the world I know well as a local & never loses the \"Wow\" for me."

Thankfully, the walk from there to Shelly Beach is quite pleasant.The beach area itself is really lovely with both sand and grass to utilise, as well as plenty of shade thanks to al the trees. We also had fun spotting several water dragons on our way. The snorkelling area is quite sheltered and fairly safe water (essential as not all of our party are strong swimmers). The visibility was not great on the day we went, but we still managed to see some schooling fish and a couple of large groupers, though very little else. All in all it was a very pleasant and enjoyable day, though the snorkelling itself is far from spectacular - though this is to be expected when you snorkel outside of tropical waters."

The only thing you have to observe is that the water isn\u00b4t safe to swim in after a storm. Sewage that is piped offshore gets wasked back onto the beaches so be careful on those days."

Shelly beach is not one of those. It's much smaller for starters, probably only about 100 metres across, and it's directly opposite of Manly. The great thing about it is that because it's opposite of Manly, it actually faces back towards the mainland, so the waves don't hit it. Now, if you're there to surf, forget it, but if you want to swim or snorkel, it really is ideal because the peninsula of which the beach is a part, shields you from the waves and makes swimming very pleasant. The beach is very kid-friendly, as it's shallow for a little while. The water is usually very clear, and snorkelling is very rewarding. Lots and lots of fish all over the place, and even some really big blue gophers, and if you're lucky, even a couple of bottom-dwelling rays or Wobbegong sharks (all not dangerous)."
