            "review": "Eye opening must visit when in Cape Town. My wife and I were in Cape Town recently and one of the things recommended to us by family who have visited is Robben Island.We booked for a 11am departure a couple of days in advance online via the official website (we booked via our phones and took a screenshot of the barcode tickets which were scanned on the day).The booking advises you must be at the departure point in the V&A Waterfront area a minimum of 30 minutes earlier than the ticket time but in reality due to the queuing process you could be later. After having tickets scanned you proceed through an airport style security check before going to the boat(s) to go across to Robben Island.On the way to Robben Island we were on the Jester boat which I believe is the larger of the two boats on the trip which is boarded first and is also by far slower at making the crossing taking over 45 minutes. There is downstairs enclosed seating but most people go upstairs up to the limit of capacity especially as it can be a bit choppy out at sea! On the way back we deliberately held back to get on the faster boat which though leaving a few minutes later than Jester made it back to Cape Town quite a few minutes earlier and it definitely felt a smoother ride.On arrival on the island you either go first for a bus ride around parts of the island and then have a guided walking tour of the prison or do the walking tour first then the bus ride.The bus ride is quite interesting and there is an opportunity for picture taking and a shop area to buy drinks and snacks though the highlight is of course the prison tour.The prison tour is with a past political prisoner on the island, this brings the whole experience to life hearing first hand experiences as well as seeing cell areas including Nelson Mandelas.It is a sad experience visiting the island with all the history it has but I do think a visit to Cape Town must include a trip here especially at the reasonable cost."

It's important that we never forget what happened to our fellow human beings during the Apartheid years. To see the lime quarry and Mandela's cell bring out strong emotions. Being guided around the former maximum security prison by an ex political prisoner is also a memorable moment."

Be prepared because it's slow and not the smoothest ride but it is safe! Once we arrived at Robben Island we got into a bus which took us to the prison where Nelson Mandela was kept. We were guided buy an ex prisoner who explained the history of the jail. It was great. However the jail was newly painted and did not give the historical feel I imagined. We saw Nelson Mandelas prison cell and it was cool, not exactly what I expected. After the tour of the prison we got back into the bus and our guides took us around Robben Island and provided us with a brief history surrounding different architecture. We made a stop at a gift shop which was right beside a little beach that had penguins, you can't approach them as they are not friendly. Overall it was a good trip!"

Two pre requisites if you're visiting Cape town----Table mountain and here.Expect huge queues on the jetty pre boarding and re embarking for the ferry which takes about 40 minutes to reach the island.It's a shame you're not given much time or scope to wander round at will with your own thoughts as you take in the surroundings of the inhumanity of the prison.Frankly you don't need to be told everything the guide tells you on board the tour bus---it speaks for itself.Having said that, the former inmate who gives his spiel is endearing and informative as he shows you round the prison.A bit more organisation on the boarding proceedure and queueing and a bit less formal herding on the island would improve the whole experience no end.That said, it's not to be missed, the views alone across the bay to Table mountain are worth the trip, as is the rest of the island which,apart from the prison, idyllic."

We learnt so much from this tour, I am South African and I didn't know about the history of Robben island, all I knew was that Nelson Mandela was a prisoner there. The tour starts at V & A Waterfront where you board a ferry which takes you to the island. We were so lucky, we saw some whales on the way! Once you get off the ferry you board a bus with a tour guide, our guide was Mpho, he was very friendly and knowledgeable. The bus takes you all around the island to see the churches, the cemetery, the quarry's, the village (where ex-prisoners and ex-prison wardens now live because the work at Robben island) there is also a stop along the way if you should want to use a toilet or buy some snakes. The bus stops at the prison where an ex-prisoner takes you through the prison and tells you stories of how it use to be. The last stop is Nelson Mandela's old cell. On the way back to the ferry there is shops for souvenirs and snacks. A ferry then takes you back to V & A. Booking is essential, we thought you could just buy tickets on the day, but they were sold out, the only tickets available were for the following day."

We bought the tickets online a few days before, and the process worked smoothly. Before you embark on the boat you can view a series of very informative exhibits on the history of colonialism and apartheid in South Africa. The sea was a bit rough, so the boat trip was not great, but the visit to the island and the prisons were moving. I particularly liked the fact that it is a former prisoner who guides you through the prisons. It really gives you the feeling of experiencing a living piece of history."

We had a family visit in October 2016.After the tedious process of ordering tickets in advance and waiting in line to pick them up, we waited again in line to board the boat (about 45 minute wait).The process of getting people to the island needs to be streamlined - there is no reason to be waiting in long lines when everything is so computerized.As to the experience.While waiting in these lines the time could have been used to give a much better tale and story of the history of the Island and the people who were imprisoned. There is a lot of work to be done.After a 45 minute trip - which is in very basic ships that you feel every wave (I recommend taking motion sickness medication), you arrive at the Island. Again, they could have used these 45 minutes to enhance the visit by explaining a bit about the Cape Town Port or other facts associated with the trip.On the Island you get on a very old bus. When the motor is running you cannot hear a thing. The so called tour guide was very poor with explanations that fit a kindergarten class at most. You make two stops, one at the coffee shop and one at the prison where Mandela's cell was. Here we were greeted by a former inmate - as a tour guide. With all due respect to the authenticity of having an inmate a tour guide the experience was clearly missed. Very basic facts and figures - no emotions or personal experiences what a missed opportunity."

However there is more to this island including its history prior to the political prison, its use as a sanctuary for a variety of migratory birds, and the island also has its own colony of the endangered African Penguin. The boat ride over can get a little rough in strong swells, however you might be lucky to see dolphins or even a whale or two. If the seas are too rough the trips will be cancelled. Book well in advance, this is not a trip you can book for in the day due to it always being sold out. Well worth it though."

He clearly knew his stuff and was really engaging with the people on the coach who were of a variety of nationalities.We were guided around the prison by a former political prisoner of Robben Island. He shared his experience and gave witness to the time he spent there and the struggle for freedom. Nelson Mandela's prison cell is an experience that humbles in terms of the human spirit in adverse conditions.It is an unforgettable experience and it should not be missed if visiting Cape Town. It was also a surprise to me that the village on the island still has families living there and they have everything any other community has, except no longer a school, which I think is sad as the children have to travel by boat each day to Cape Town. The penguins are delightful as were the tortoises and we were lucky to see the Sacred Ibex that had migrated there for the season. So if you like nature this is also a good trip for you."

I did not like that part.We went to Robben Island shortly after lunch. Our bus tour guide was named 'Toyer' and bus driver was 'Andre'.Toyer was a fascinating and passionate bus tour guide who had been doing his 8th tour that day due to sickness on the team. He was fantastic and it was really interesting to see the history of the island not just the prison. Once completed we were given a tour of the prison by an ex prisoner. I really wish I caught his name. He was a fascinating, well spoken individual that had most people hanging on his every word.One social commentary that is nothing to do with the tour but what summed up parts of society today was when we were standing in the court yard where Mandela had his garden, a couple who must have been late 40's were strolling around the yard which I took to being exploring the history. On closer inspection it turns out these individuals were simply playing Pokemon Go as this fascinating ex prisoner gave real insight into Nelson Mandela and himself. It bugged me for the remainder of the tour. Either way well worth a visit."

You really cannot appreciate the significance of this place in terms of influence over the history of South Africa and its journey to freedom until you visit and hear the stories of what happened from the people who lived it and this is what you get when you visit Robben Island. You start with a bumpy ferry ride to the island then jump on to a bus (which can be crowded) and you are driven around the island whilst your guide introduces you to the interesting history of the island, also the flora and fauna etc. Once you have done the bus tour you then visit the maximum security facility that held Mandela and other political prisoners. Your tour guide for this leg is an ex-prisoner which adds so much more intimacy and meaning to the tour. We had Sparks, a lovely and very genuine man who spoke simply and plainly about his time on the island. Remember that none of these guides are professionals - they speak from the heart and without training. The tours are quite full and there can be a lot of people but that doesn't detract from the quality of the experience. I would recommend everyone visiting Robben Island."

The tour starts on the wharf at the island with a drive around to show and tell the history of the island. On the driving tour, you get to see the town where the wardens lived, the quarry where the prisoners worked, the graveyard from the leper colony and other points from the islands history. Then, we were dropped at the prison itself. Our tour guide was a former prisoner from the F Block. He showed us the F Block where he was held, the A Block and cell where Nelson Mandela was held, the garden where Mandela had a plot and other areas within the prison compound. Very enlightening about the apartheid period."

A ferry leaves from the V&A Waterfront several times a day for those who have purchased tour tickets. We purchased our tickets in advance on the Internet to ensure we wouldn't miss out. If you are prone to sea sickness be warned that the older ferries can be quite rough, especially if you are on the lower, enclosed deck. Once on the island, the tour takes you by bus to see various buildings and the quarry where forced labour took place. There is a stop at a lookout with beautiful views back to Cape Town. The last stop is the cell blocks where you are greeted by a new tour guide, who is an ex political prisoner. He explains the living conditions, the reasons for imprisonment and a little about Nelson Mandela. It is very touching to hear the personal stories and see the sparse living conditions .Then it is back on the ferry to Cape Town.."

We then had a tour of the prison by an ex-prisoner Zozo (sorry don't know the correct spelling). Most of the stories he told were awful but it gave you a real understanding of what happened during Mandela's imprisonment there. Would thoroughly recommend it but you do need to book as it's very busy plus there is a chance if it's windy that the ferry will be cancelled. We were booked on the 1pm ferry and we were delayed by almost an hour, we discovered later that it was because they weren't sure it could run. We heard that the day before the 1pm ferry was cancelled and they couldn't offer our friends a new date until 3 days later and by then they'd left Cape Town."

Later on we heard all the guides claim to be ex-prisoners. He had heavy accent and if someone asked him to repeat he would get cranky. Some people from our group commented about prisons on Andaman Islands in India and the severity the prisoners faced there was extreme, the guide was offended and I wonder if he showed us everything he was supposed to.

You can click good photographs here. If you have2-3 days in Cape Town, you need not waste time here. Go to Apartheid Museum/City tour."

It does help if you know the history of the struggle against apartheid, but you can catch up during the tour. I found it obscene that people were taking selfies outside Mandela's cell rather than contemplating the significance of the place they were visiting. You are taken on a bus tour before visiting the prison - there is no food on the island but one place where you can gets drinks. There are great views and photo opportunities at this stop, including Cape penguins and Table Mountain. At the prison you are taken around by a former inmate. Previous reviews have listed the tour details - it is rushed and shorter than you might like. I was told there are plans to improve the tourist experience and give tourists more freedom to walk around. There are displays at the jetty but no time to read them all. The organisation of the tour prior to embarkation was chaotic, but ignoring that, it is well worth the effort. If you are on a full day tour of the townships and Robben Island, it is a good idea to take a packed lunch in case your guide leaves you at the quay at the last minute - our group was lucky to grab a sandwich in the quayside cafe before embarking."

Not sure what to expect either, since it is a place of great history, not one of SA's finest to say the least. Although the first part is very commercial - everyone hops on a bus and drives around looking through the windows of the bus to see the several historic land marks of the island. Bit disappointing since I was looking forward to take in more of the heritage in open air instead of sitting in a bus with 49 other people. The second part of the tour felt more real since our guide was an ex-prisoner who made a very strong, proud and positive impression. The way he talked about his past, SA's past and where we are at now, amazing. How such a man can stand in front of so many people everyday and talk with such pride. Amazing! I feel very privileged to have witnessed just a small part of his story at Robben island."

Like most visitors, we were organised when arriving at Cape Town with our tickets already purchased and were eagerly anticipating this to be one of the highlights. We had visited the Apartheid Museum in Johannesburg - which was fantastic, including the permanent exhibition on Mandela - and so felt we had a great overview of both the history of Apartheid and the man. It was a beautiful crisp early Spring morning which augured well for our ferry trip and the views back to Table Mountain were superb. What we didn't like was that immediately on entry we were herded onto the ferry like cattle. There was no time to read the information on boards before showing our ticket. On arrival we were shunted onto buses where our guide gave us a history of the island. This was clear and concise and if we hadn't had him for the first part, I would have felt decidedly ripped off. When we arrived at the prison block, we were rushed through - the guide - a former prisoner - spoke very quickly and was difficult to understand and was not a sympathiser of Mandela. (Was this because he had to run back to find a key to open the cells- don't know.) Had no idea what was Mandela's cell because the group was so large and by the time we got them, the guide and half the tour group had already been and gone. I guess we were lucky that the weather was good and we didn't get sea sick as well. Unlike the Apartheid Museum where I came out with empathy and emotion, this all left me cold and my recommendation? if you only have 3 days in Cape Town as we did, I would not spend 4 hours doing this tour. Highly recommend the Free Walking Tour of Bo Kaap or District Six instead."

A must visit place if you are in South Africa. It's recommend that you pre-book tickets as the place is accessible through ferry and they have limited number of tickets each day. You will need about an hour to reach there, about a couple of hours touring the place and about an hour to come back, so be prepared to block half a day for this. I would recommend going their early morning else the place becomes quite hot as you will have to walk quite a lot in open and will be taken from ferry jetty to the prison in a non AC bus!"

You are met at the island by a tour guide who shows you the sights of the island that is now only inhabited by museum staff and their families. A key part of this tour is the limestone quarry where prisoners worked in all weathers with no eye protection from the sun's reflection on the stone. There is a pile of stones that was started by Nelson Mandela and his fellow ex-prisoners when they returned to the island for a poignant reunion. But the real tour starts when you are met at the prison gates by an ex political prisoner who will show you the prison but also give you his own personal story. What these men went through for their cause to right the injustice of apartheid is humbling and should not be forgotten. But go while you can hear it from their own lips and not from a tour guide."

Once we were off the bus and at the prison we were excited to hear that our tour would be given by a former political prisoner; yet due to the very large number of people in our group we could rarely hear him or the stories he was sharing.

There are really only a few, but they are significant and impacted the entire experience:1. While in concept, the opportunity to have a former inmate give a tour of the prison is a good one. What better guide than one that can share his personal experience? Unfortunately, that\u2019s where the brilliance stops \u2013 at the concept. Who you get as a prison guide is random. When you get off the short bus ride over to the prison from the boat, the former inmate who is now your guide gets not half the bus to tour, but the entire bus. Already, the size of the group is a problem because the guide\u2019s voice must carry loud enough for all of us to hear. However, even if your guide could project loud enough, it wouldn\u2019t matter when the guide\u2019s English is difficult to understand. Our guide\u2019s English was heavy with an accent. He also spoke in broken sentences, talked in circles, and often repeated himself. While I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a cultural thing or not, but his attitude also came across as pompous. It was off putting. It became immediately apparent that tourists whose first language was not English were giving up on trying to understand our guide. They were breaking off from our group and sitting down wherever and whenever they could. This infuriated our guide. The tour felt long and drawn out because our guide also talked incredibly slow. Nelson Mandela\u2019s cell was saved almost for the last part of the tour. Our guide spoke little of Mandela and by the time we got there, we couldn\u2019t wait to catch the next boat out. How incredibly unfortunate. We spoke to our other friends who visited the island on a different day and had a different guide (we checked) and their experience was the same. They could not understand their guide. 2. The boat ride over and the boat ride back. If you are prone to motion sickness, be prepared. There are two boats that are used. The older boat is one of the original boats used to transport the prisoners. While we appreciate the historic significance of the boat, I don\u2019t need to actually experience what they did. It was a rough ride. While none in our group got sick, many of us were in a cold sweat and close to it. What\u2019s annoying is on the ride back, we got a newer, faster boat. The waters were still rough, but it was a much more tolerable ride. Nonetheless the motion sickness had set in and ruined the rest of the day for us. 3. There are large billboards throughout the prison of prisoners in organized group photos. Other than listing the names of the people in the photo, few billboards explained the significance and purpose of the photo. Now the pros\u2026.and I\u2019m stretching here, just to balance it out:- The website is well laid out and has helpful information. - The ticket purchase process was extremely easy. - The option to save the ticket on our smart phone for scanning purposes is convenient. - The building to which you catch the boat ride over is large and easily accessible, located in a great area. - The bathrooms on the island are clean.- The bus ride over to the prison was the BEST part of the whole excursion because the guide on the bus was articulate, funny, engaging, and informative. (The lime quarries, wow!) - The second best part was the quick rest break before the prison to grab a quick coffee or snack and take pictures across the waters to see Cape Town. There are a few penguins along the shore as well. Dear Tourism Board, if you\u2019re paying attention, I know there\u2019s contention to keep the former inmates as the guides. I completely understand and I still think to have them as part of the tour is valuable. Take note that even places like Choeng Ek Genocidal Centre (The Killing Fields of Cambodia), provide audio headset tours. What a better option to provide English and non-English speaking visitors a chance to learn the island\u2019s great history. The tales of former inmates can be included in the audio narrative and it would also be great to have former inmates available after the tour for an optional meet and greet and Q and A. That\u2019s my 2 cents/27 R."

You will be given a live narrated tour of the island which is more than just the actual prison. After about 15/20 minutes, there will be a break with the opportunity to use the bathroom or buy some refreshments (hot and cold drinks, sandwiches, candy bars, crisps). After the break, the bus tour continues until you get out at the prison. Here another guide takes over who will show you the interiors and especially Nelson Mandela's cell.

He was very interesting, though it wasn't always easy to understand all he was saying. Views back to Cape town were good. It was definitely worth going. It would be good if there was more freedom to explore yourself - perhaps they will get round to offering bikes for hire and a self-guided tour"

Yes it was an experience seeing where an icon of the modern era lived for so long, but apart from seeing the cell, finding out a few facts, I cant say it was that great! Alot more exciting things to do in Cape Town!!"

I think this is more important for travel in the South African summer. Allow yourself some time to review the exhibitions at the building at the Nelson Mandela pier. While there is some information on the walls of the room to access the pier (and the Robben Island ferry), it's hard to read them when the room is full of people waiting to travel out. The tour is split between tour of the island (given by a resident) and a tour of the prison, given by a former political prisoner. Very moving."

But then I made a discreet announcement inquiring if anyone in line had extra tickets and 5 people raised their hands. So if you really want to go and are not shy, there will be space for you.

The boat ride across was picturesque, and on the day we went, quite pleasant in terms of the sea. I have heard however it is sometimes not for the feint hearted. Once your on the island the tour is in 2 parts. The first on a bus with a very knowledgeable guide who shows you the pertinent spots on the island and gives a good insight into the overall goings on there and where things happened. The next part is even more interesting as you are shown around by an ex-inmate who tells not only the story of Nelson Mandela and some other high profile inmates, but is in the position to give you the benefit of his own personal experience. A great half day trip for the history buff. Don't be fooled into thinking you may miss the boat back as they run all day and you can apparently get any one back. It is apparently best to go early as more often than not if the sea or the weather gets bad it is later in the day."

Pre booked the boat ride out to Robben Island, luckily it was a good morning on the water, but very foggy. 45 Minute slow boat ride, that would be shocking on a bad day. Herded off the boat as soon as it docked, shoved onto 45 seater busses, the bus doesnt stop anywhere, you are expected to take pictures from inside the bus and the seating is 3 wide at the back, so no good views. Drive around for an hour, only place you stop is a little cafe and told to take a 10 minute break which turns into 1/2 hr because so many of you on the bus. Then dropped at the jail, rushed through a tour packed with other tour groups, then have to quickly walk back to the boat as the horn is blowing to say its leaving for the day. Not worth the trip over to get 10 seconds of a view of Mandella's cell."

We read that book and also watched the Mandela film starring Idris Elba the morning before we set off. The journey out to the island on the Ferry was haunting - we left a Cape Town with blue skies and temperatures of 24'C, but found Robben Island in a bank of damp bitterly cold mist. It is a miracle that with this perishing wintry microclimate the inmates, sleeping on thin mattresses on the stone floor equipped with one thin blanket each didn't die of pneumonia within a couple of weeks.

It's wise to arrive in plenty of time for your allocated boat (sailings in August were at 9.00, 11.00 and 13.00) because the boats are very full and so choice of seating limited. Also the tours are so popular that if your time in Cape Town is limited it would be wise to book well in advance ( can be booked on the net). After landing on the island we were asked to join buses parked 100yds or so from the quayside and were taken on a short tour round the island guided by an amusing commentator. At the maximum security prison, where Mandela was held, we were treated for over half an hour to a fascinating talk and tour by an ex prisoner. His clear explanation of what life was like for political prisoners such as Mandela and himself was delivered with such calm reflection and with not a shred of bitterness. It was very moving and an experience I shall never forget. The cost was around \u00a318 per person and having left on the 11.00 boat we were back on the Cape Town Waterfront just after 15.00.

Each part of the island has its own story, so the trip provides a deep perceptive of life under apartheid."

It was thought-provoking, interesting, educational, and at times a bit sad. We particularly appreciated the final part of the tour with one of the former inmates, who really brought to life the terrible reality of being imprisoned there during apartheid. I asked him why he'd want to return to the island after that experience, and he said essentially to bear witness to what went down, so that people would always remember, and perhaps try to prevent something like this in the future."

Boarding the boat to Robben Island is somewhat chaotic, but we all got onboard safely and the boat itself seemed very safe - even with several hundred people on board. The boat trip to Robben Island takes about an hour (each way), and then our tour around the island and through the prison areas took about 75 minutes. On the boat trips, we saw whales, many THOUSANDS of seabirds of maybe 6 species, and hundreds of seals on the island itself. That was just about worth the price alone. The tour on the island, and through the prison areas, was very moving and an eye-opener. We had one of the former political prisoner inmates as our tour guide, and his matter-of-fact description of what went on there last century was a graphic eye-witness account. It was both very disturbing and also a privilege to listen to what he had to say.My tip would be - be sure to be self-sufficient in water and food for the round trip.Overall - just excellent. I thought it was worth every dollar."

And this is not because of it great historical significance, which it is, but because you will get the best views of Cape Town and Table Mountain when you're on the boat going and coming from Robben Island.Even in the winter months this is a popular trip so I would suggest you book your tickets online in advance, You print your tickets out at home and present them at the entrance. I was asked if I had tickets to sell when we arrived so you can see how busy this tour is.You catch the boat at the Waterfront (the building is well marked on maps). Go a little early as there is an interesting exhibition to see.There are appear 2 different types of boats, one larger and slower (45 minute trip) and a smaller faster one (30 minute trip). You may see some seals as you depart but the highlight are the fantastic views and photo opportunities you get on the boat trips. The smaller boat had an open upper deck so lots of viewing ares and the larger boat has great views from the rear as you leave Cape Town.When you off load on the island we were divided into groups of about 20 and met by our guide who was a ex-inmate of the prison. Undoubtedly this is the best part of this tour in that you hear real life experiences.Its a short walk to the dormitories and then onto the individual cells which held the more important prisoners including Nelson Mandela. There is no plaque outside his cell as we were told he didn't want any special recognition for his cell, but there is a bucket in it which differentiates it from the others. Some people do complain that it has become a bit sanitised but it is a tourist attraction now and the highlight is actually the stories your guide will tell.(in our case it included is arrest, torture and incarceration here fro 5 years).There is plenty of opportunity to ask your guide questions.After the prison tour you board a bus with a different guide and are then given a tour of the rest of the island, which has a long and colourful history well before it was used as a prison for political prisoners. (e.g.whaling station, leper colony, naval base). You also get to stop at the quarry but are not allowed to disembark here.The bus will stop at a viewing point at the north side of the island and there is a great photo opportunity of views towards Cape Town and Table Mountain. They have one of those Instagram frames as well. There is a small shop here for drinks and snacks.At the harbour there is a shop for some souvenir shopping and if you don't get a chance here then there is a shop in the main building at the waterfront.In all like I said, if you can do this trip first before you do the rest of Cape Town."

But because this unique former leper colony and prison is so irrevocably connected with the history of the nation. There was so much suffering and exploitation here. Yet out of the incarceration of political prisoners came the emerging first step of democracy. The guides are former prisoners who speak with humility and are dedicated to the evolving nation. Book your trip in advance to avoid the queues. That, at least, is luxury. But you will be unsettled yet uplifted by the whole experience. Thi is one of th most significant visits you can make."

A commentary would have been appreciated even if it was just pointing out the obvious points of interest. The organisation on the island is a bit confusing, no proper instructions given. The tour of some of the prison cells is amazing. The tour guides are ex-prisoners and that added an amazing dimension to the visit. Based on the above I would be tempted to rate the experience a 5/5 but for the bus trip tour of the island. It was terrible. The bus is far too crowded and you are not allowed off to look at the sights so you see very little. The buses are old, dirty, smelly and billowing diesel fumes.The commentary was mostly unintelligible. The tour guide seemed to be having a good time but the visitors were bored. I couldn't wait for it to be over and it is far too long. Overall I would not recommend this trip because of the bus tour and the excessive time taken where you stand around doing nothing or just sit and wait on the bus."

African winter but still needed to book 6 days in advance for the time we wanted.You get there by ferry, and you need to remember that the sea is not predictable. We were okay as we are well used to travel on water, but there was a fair swell on the return crossing which some found uncomfortable. Also, you cannot miss the very strong fishy smell as you arrive, probably a combination of the nesting sea-birds and the seals.Once you get off your ferry you will have a bus tour of the island. We had a really good guide called Kent (or Kennet or similar) who was compulsive listening. He explained the life and time on the island of Robert Sobukwe (read 'How can Man Die Better') as well as Nelson Mandela. We were told the history of the island from first colonisation and subsequent use as a leper colony, as well as its more well-known use as a prison.The second part of the tour is a walking tour, where you are shown around by a former inmate. Ours was good, again, but the group was a little bit on the large side and you couldn't always hear what he was saying (so don't hang back).The gift shop is good, but the food and drink supplies are limited at best, so plan to eat before or after your visit. We didn't have time to walk and see the penguins, which was a shame.Overall, a day not to be missed, but probably not for young children who will require a little more stimulation, and it would be a shame for them to spoil it for others (and that's not their fault - they are kids after all!)."

The reception by personnel at the Island was so professional and warm. The tour began from the cells, by the time we got to the hall, it was clear that everybody was shocked with the first hand information we got. We were then taken on a bus tour . The few minutes we spent there, was a true eye opener, Hence I say that was a moment of truth.

There is lots of time on boats, busses and in very small rooms and tight quarters not made for antsy, loud kids. Please, I beg of you - don't bring them and ruin it for everyone else. With all the languages/accents and echoing hallways I had 3 children under the age of 2 or 3 that screamed, cried, ran etc. Parents trying to \"shush\" them, chase them or worse - parents that do nothing made for a frustrating 3+ hours. Tangent over. As others note - book the first boat of the day. Waters are supposedly smoother then and you have less of a chance of cancellation. Our trip over to the island at 9 am was somewhat rough, with more than one person running to the bath and using barf bags. They ended up canceling the afternoon boats today as the swells were just too high.The ride takes about 30-45 mins. You then board busses for a tour around the island prior to going into the prison. My bus was perfectly filled (everyone had a seat), but some others were really jammed full. We had a fantastic guide in Tabo, he was very patient while tour members on our bus talked loudly while he was educating us on buildings, stops or were late returning from scheduled breaks. He was very well spoken and clear. I felt for him with some of the folks on our bus, they challenged all of us with their lack of self awareness.The prison tour was good - I had a hard time hearing the guide at all times, I'm guessing who you get as your guide matters here.All and all it's a worthwhile trip but I wish we were given the opportunity to walk around at our own pace or in smaller groups. Obviously this is driven by the boat limitations but I would have really enjoyed more interaction and Q&A with less people in a group. This is a peaceful place, and one that deserves respect. I felt as if a good number of people that come here don't view it as such which is a shame."

Many attempts were made to break their spirit. Some of the guides are ex- prisoners and we met a former guard who befriended Mandela and was invited to attend the ceremony when Mandela became president. After getting off the ferry, we went on an hour's tour around the island with a guide telling us many interesting things about the actual island which had one times housed people with Leprosy and about Nelson Mandela and other political prisoners. We saw the quarry where Mandela worked. You then visit the actual prison and see the various blocks and the cell and compound where Mandela spent his time and given an overview of prison life.On the negative side, we felt the groups were too big and the guide started to speak before we were all in the room so we missed a lot of what he said. The full bus load was left as a group but this should have been split into two groups inside the jail so we could all hear. We also felt that we were rushed too much so didn't have the time to read the signs with many interesting facts and explanations. Despite this, it is definitely worth a visit and the on the ferry ride back from the island,if the day is clear, there are great views of the port and Table Mountain."

When we came here I had already done the Soweto tour, apartheid museum and constitutional hill tours in Johannesburg (all three are excellent and highly recommended tours). If you don't get to Johannesburg for these tours then this tour is an important one to attend but be warned that it is a long one so bring drinks and a snack with you. They do stop at one point and you can buy a snack and drink but when we were there the store was pretty picked over. It was important to see this attraction as it does hold incredible significance to South Africa's apartheid history but after being at the other attractions in Johannesburg this one felt less informative and quite long. In my mind the tour could have been 1/2 as long and provided more information. We did enjoy the boat ride out to the island but did not enjoy being stuck on the boat at the end of the day waiting for stragglers and island staff as we were the last boat out that day. I would take an earlier tour to avoid that wait."

He was on a schedule and we felt rushed through there were a lot of stories on the walls of the cells that were interesting and sometimes inspiring to read but time was so limited that we probably only had time to read a quarter of them. We also had an incident of a group of over 30 who did not all speak English and the method that they were using to translate was initially very disruptive. both tour guides caught on quickly and made arrangements to accommodate this group in a less disruptive manner. It's unfortunate that the guides weren't advised of this issue in advance. Maybe the museum should look into headphones with some sort of translation capability for those that don't speak English. It was a very tight schedule to get back to the ferry at the assigned departure time. It would have been nice to be able to spend the time to finish reading some of those essays by former prisoners."

We visited the group cells were Jama gave us a little insight into what life was like, from the food they were given, to the bedding and routine of a normal day.We then went to the single cells, and passed Nelson Mandela's cell. At the end of the tour there is a short walk back to the boat for the trip back to the mainland.Very moving, informative and a must do on your list of activities - for international and South African tourists! Book in advance, but be prepared that your tour may be cancelled due to weather, so you may need to change your date."

Whilst the boat trip was a little long to and from the island, it gave us an opportunity to enjoy Cape Town from a different view. The bus tour on the island was great and our guide was very knowledgeable, informative and interactive making the tour enjoyable and very educational. The time spent with the ex-inmate was an awesome touch and hearing from someone who experienced the island first hand really brought the overall experience to life. Our only disappointment was not being able to jump off at the quarry (only a bus stop and view) and walk around the island freely whilst there."

It's a humbling experience but one that is steeped in history.When arriving on the island you are taken on a bus tour round the island where you find out the island is so much more than just \"Mandela.\" You then go into the actual prison where you are guided by a former political prisoner. My only criticism would be the nature of this guide wasn't the best and whilst he was evidently passionate about the island he conveyed it in a very muddled manner. There were also too many people in the group making photo opportunities rushed.However this did not deter from a fascinating experience and one I would thoroughly recommend."

Do your own research. It is a terribly underutilized place. It could be one of the top draw cards in Africa if politics were discarded. It has its own vote in local electoral terms.

We had a very knowledgeable tour guide who pointed out all the significant landmarks as we went around the island. However, we found the maximum security prison part of the tour somewhat disappointing. The great thing was having an ex-political prisoner talk about his experiences and what happened to the people held there. The problem is the talk went on for such a very long time! They need to sit down with these tour guides and give them some guidelines regarding what they should say. Make it concise. After 30 mins our ability to take in info was just done. After all that, we only had minutes walking past Mandela's cell. Maybe the part of the talk about conditions of prisoners should be in the hallway where these cells are.

Due to the unstable and windy weather in Cape Town, the chances of having the trip cancelled are high. Our first booking was cancelled due to high winds but we were refunded automatically. Fortunately, our second booking was on a sunny day. There are two trips per day, at 11:00 and 13:00 and the whole trip takes around 4 hours (including the boat rides from/to the island). The boat trip to the island is around 30 min (make sure to bring some medication with you if you're prone to sea sick).We were taking on a guided bus tour around the island and a small village where the employees live, which was pretty interesting. We then got to enter the prison and tour the cells (including Mandela's).

Great half day, but allow the time, and if you have pre-booked be there about 20 minutes before you board to go through security! Large crowds in summer so precook tickets on the net saves the quese's!"

Robben Island should be recommended to anyone interested in South Africa's history.The tour involves a ferry ride to get to the island and you are there for about 4 hours [the time there and the ferry rides going and coming back] The highlight of the tour is that you get to meet former prisoners who share their experiences of what it was like to be incarcerated on the island under apartheid. It is very emotional when they tell their stories. They will also take you to the cell where Nelson Mandela spent most of his time. it is imperative to get tickets for Robben Island either in advance or as soon as you arrive in Capetown. We arrived on a Monday and wanted to go the next day and they were sold out. We were fortunate enough to be in Capetown for 4 days otherwise we would have missed Robben Island. Do not miss this!"

Some thought it a little disappointing, thinking more could have been done to bring the prisoners' time there alive. The tour is certainly downbeat and low key. This for me added to the authenticity of an ex prisoner's personal story and made it more compelling. Robben Island is about 7 miles from the V&A Waterfront and the waters can be choppy so it is important to recognise this if you suffer from mal de mer. We went out of season so it was not very busy. In summer it can get busy so it is worthwhile booking online in advance."

The journey across was fine, but you need to check which ferry you are on as there are fast ferries and slow. We took 50mins on the outward journey and 30mins on the inward. Once we arrived we were greeted by an ex inmate and transported around the island on a bus. We stopped to look at a several places but we're only aloud off the bus at the coffee shop for photos. We were taken to look at the quarry where the prisoners had been made to work. We saw a pile of stones which had been placed by ex prisoners, but again we were only aloud to photo these from the bus. It was a shame that there was no opportunity to walk around the quarry and experience the place. Our tour guide on the bus was engaging and informative and easy for all to understand. We then arrived at the prison and were escorted around by an ex inmate. We were taken to a large room where the gentleman talked about his own views. An opportunity missed to engage all about the prison life. He was hard to comprehend at times. I feel this is not really a child friendly trip as it was not inspirational or uplifting.I would liked to have heard more about daily life, read information and seen artefacts etc.Sadly a disappointing experience which could have been so much more."

Tours are given by people who were jailed there, and the gentleman running the store was Mandela's guard. Would be very wise if you read the book Long Walk to Freedom before you visit. As well, bring a copy of the book--Nelson Mandela- My Prisoner My Friend with you as the author is running the store-- would be a great autograph to have! I would STRONGLY recommend booking this attraction online. Many who were there for only a day or two went away disappointed. On of this best tour we completed in our five week stay.

A visit to Robben island a tribute to those incredible heroes as Nelson Mandela and Walter Sisulu. Despite this the tour to the island is disappointing. The boat tour takes about 30 minutes. Be one of the first to board, so you can sit on the upper deck. When full you have to sit at the closed lower deck. Especially when you get seasick easily this is not the best place to be. Arriving on the island you are crammed in a bus and hurried along the different places on the island. I would gladly walked the limestone quarry, but we were not allowed to leave the bus at other places than the shore with beautiful sights on Cape Town and Table Mountain.At the end of the tour you are guided through the prison were the political prisoners were imprisoned, by an ex-political prisoner. The mere fact that an actual (ex)prisoner tells the story is special and makes the trip worthwhile. On the other hand, if you want to get information on the regime on Robben island, the prisoners and the apartheid regime, you better check wikipedia."

He took us around the prison showing us the cells (including Nelson Mandela's cell) and common areas. We then went back to the boat and crossed back to Cape Town. The tour lasted about 3 hours.

The tour of the prison was lead by a former prisoner. He was very good and we thought that really added to the tour. The one and only criticism id have of the tour was nelson mandelas cell was the exact same as all the rest. Probably because they wanted to show he was one of many prisoners and they were all equal but I thought maybe if they opened it or at very least have the number of his cell 46664 on the door or something like that. We were at the back of the group and we didn't hear our guide saying this was his cell. Should really be some small plaque or sign to say this was his cell."

I would definitely recommend it to anyone interested in South Africa's history. The tour is variable with a ferry ride and a walking tour and bus tour on the island. We were really lucky with the weather and the ferry ride was lovely. The prison tour was done by an ex prisoner which gives the tour a very genuine feel. It was however, at times, quite difficult to hear our guide. He has quite a strong accent so was sometimes a bit difficult to understand (especially, I would imagine, for those not from South Africa). I think if the groups were smaller on the prison tour section of the tour it mean more people could hear and take in more of what was being said. Although cost wise this may of course not be feasible. Perhaps more literature around the island would have been helpful for those not that familiar with the history of the island.The bus tour was very informative and overall I think the whole day was well managed and well delivered.My only complaint about the experience would be the ticket office. I'd booked over the phone and just had to collect the tickets. We waited in the ticket sales queue for ages (the collection queue was unmanned). "

If there is anything to criticize about the trip is it was sad to note that when we waited for our boat to return 100's of travelers where unable to buy anything from the curio shop on the island as it closes before the last tour is fen done. The other concern was that some of the information about life on the island from our first guy on the bus did not match info from our guide who himself was an inmate. Maybe a bit of fact checking is in order."

The tour starts with a bus ride around the island, and our guide for that was great and very informative. Then a former prisoner gives a walking tour of the prison building where Nelson Mandela's cell is. Unfortunately our guide was very hard to understand. Even the South Africans on the tour couldn't understand him. It was disappointing because he clearly was very passionate and we would have loved to know what he was saying or to have been able to ask him questions."

The prison and the stories of the prison are very oppressive, but at the same time the physical environment is beautiful. The island has been used for many things over history, from a ship docking place to a leper colony, to a political prison, to now a major tourist exhibit. Our guide for the tour had been held at their as a political prisoner so he had much to tell us about the conditions for the prisoners. It was amazing to me that he had a relatively upbeat outlook considering all that he had been through. We toured the prison and the island seeing the remains from the church built by the people in the leper colony to the prison cells, one of which had contained Nelson Mandela. The dining room had a poster that showed what each group was fed based on skin color. It was appauling. The boat ride out to the island lets you see the physical beauty of the island. There are many sea birds living there and there are some beautiful seascapes to be seen along the coast. Of course, the fact that the water is so rough there is what made it so effective as a prison.It is definitely worth seeing if you have any interest in the history of South Africa."

Our tour guide, a former inmate who was arrested at 19 or so for his political activism and spent years in the prison not only gave us insight in an intellectual sense, but also an emotional one.

At this stop you can take a photo with the the Robbin Island sign. Wow. About 30 minutes there - once you have the photo then what - oh nothing till you get back on the bus. Then we were dropped at the prison. The guide for the prison was an ex inmate who I found overly zealous and incomprehensible. We couldn't understand a word he said and everything was so melodramatic. While I appreciate that he was providing his view and his claim to fame was that he had been incarcerated there, as a tour guide which is now - he should be able to be understood by those he is taking on tour. The whole point of the tour was to view the Nelson Mandela's cell - so for an hour we endured this tour until you get to the cell.

While not cheap, it is very good value \u2026 not just because of the island tour, but also the enjoyable ferry experience and unsurpassed views of Cape Town and Table Mountain. To book, you must go to the ferry office on the Victoria & Alfred waterfront next to the clock tower and select your ticket from the tours available at the time. It is strongly advisable to do this as soon as you get to Cape Town, as you often have to wait a few days. Also, fairly regularly the ocean is too rough to cross, so you might need to re-schedule. I met various people who missed out because they either waited too long or due to Cape Town\u2019s unpredictable weather. The tours are conducted by a former prison inmate and encompass more of the island than I\u2019d expected, and of course include a stop at the jail cell where Nelson Mandela spent 18 years.

The prison tour took us around the cells and whilst interesting we felt rushed and didn't have enough time to read a lot of the information on display boards before we were moved along. The tour also didn't seem to have much order which made it harder to understand the history of the place. We were also in a very big group and the tour guide was hard to hear.

On the one hand, it is our duty to experience the tour, but on the other it has a haunting feeling knowing what transpired here.

When Le Clerq ( spelling? ) handed over the government to the black majority it was without a civil war that you see in so many countries today. It is still an evolutionary progress but so much better for blacks than before. South Africa is essentially a three pronged society. Whites, nonwhites and blacks. It is a beautiful country finding its way peacefully into the future. I wish them the best and credit Mandela for the road of non hate."

But the truth is that for the most part the trip to Robben Island is slow and boring except for the brief period hearing a former prisoner describe life there. And it takes a long time.

It was important to us that our teenagers were able to have an insight into the torture, torment and injustice of the Apartheid regime. We were careful to emphasise to them that all slavery including modern forms were just as appalling.However the tour was up beat. It focuses on the message of forgiveness and tolerance. There was real pride that SA had managed the transition without dissolving into Civil War. Our guide at the prison was an ex-political prisoner. His description of his experiences was graphic but very real and completely believable. He brought the empty buildings to life with his descriptions.We did feel a bit rushed at the end- as you only have until your ferry leaves. The tour buses are also a bit dated- I wouldn't really care about that but the guide's microphone was unreliable- so those at the back of the coach could not decipher why he was saying."

Even I believe often asked questions such as \"How old was Nelson Mandela when he left the Island?\". Once the drive was over we went into actual prison and met with a former prisoner. That meeting is very special as you can the emotions when he is talking about it.The prison has been completely repainted and looks brand new... It made me feel like I was in hospital instead of a prison. All the drawings or writings the prisoners could have done disappeared under that bright new grey and white wall...

The story of the island on this trip is told by friendly & informative guides who explain that Robben Island wasn't just a prison in years gone by, indeed now it's home to not only families & staff but wildlife too.On your bus tour you do stop at a little type of club house allowing you to meet (in our case) an ex-guard at the prison, grab a drink & snack & make use of the bathrooms. It's not a restaurant.On arrival at the prison itself our visit was conducted by an ex-prisoner. He bought into parts of the tour his memories & experience of life at Robben. His story alone was incredible but all in all we found it an educational & fascinating visit. For those wishing to know timings our trip in total took about 4hrs including the ferry journey, the bus trip around the island the visit to the museum/prison itself & a portion of time before your return ferry journey to visit the islands shop. We thought well worth the visit.Facilities wise: The shop by the Clock Tower before you depart is quite small, for those going to the island the shop their is bigger & stocks a wider selection of items.There is not a restaurant as such that you stop at on the island - their is the small club house on your bus trip where you can get snacks, tea, coffee etc."

There prison tour was by an ex inmate, so hearing about life there first hand was emotional. If you aren't interested in this then the views of Cape Town across the bay are worth it."

Takes about half hour or so each way and there's a gift shop on the island as well as a tour bus which takes one around the island which is quite interesting. A tour around the old prison is also interesting but not something that would keep children occupied. You would need good weather also & wrap up, the ride across can be quite chilly."

I know most people are interested in the political prisoners but I would have liked to hear more about the leper colony and local chiefs the British banished to the island during colonization. I booked my ticket online but missed my tour as public transport took a lot longer than expected. Robben Island does not give refunds or reschedule."

The peacefulness is very welcome on the return.(2) The bus tour of the island. You will be ushered onto a bus and they will fill every seat before starting on the next bus. There will be a guide that gives general information about the island. This was of some interest but the guide talked rapidly and was prone to trying to punch up the talk with humor and shout-outs.(3) The tour of the prison by former inmates. On our tour it was a little confusing on which of these guides to follow and it didn't seem to sync up with the ferry departure. Get that settled in your mind because the lessons to learn from these former prisoners are well work it. Our guide was captured with 5 of his friends as political prisoners. After 6 months of torture, 4 of them were released to Robben Island to serve their time. One of their group did not survive the torture to elicit names of other protesters. With all of that as his background, he spoke calmly of what happened and expressed gratitude for those that helped them. He spoke of how important the news was and how they spread that information. Weeks after my return, I still find myself thinking of things he said and wondering how we can do things like this to each other."

The ferry crossing takes about 45 minutes each way. The entire trip lasts approximately 4 hours from start to finish. So if you depart on the 9am ferry, you should return to port about 1 to 1:15pm.Obviously you're going to visit a prison and learn about some of the history of South Africa and the apartheid regime. So don't be surprised if you shed a tear or two. It's eye opening information but definitely worth the visit.The ticket costs approximately 20 euro and included the return ferry crossing plus a bus tour and a walking tour with one of the former prisoners."

We purchased tickets online in advance to avoid a sell-out but they can be purchased on the wharf if available. You cannot park or be dropped at the terminal entrance, so do be prepared to walk a short distance. There is an exhibit about apartheid at the ferry terminal - although we did not view it because boarding starts early on busy days. The ferry ride is about an hour, and may be rough for those with motion sickness. It is also important to note the ferry sometimes cancels due to weather so be prepared to reschedule if you can.Once on the island itself, the focus is on detention and prison life. The first half is a tour of the island itself conducted on a bus, and photo opportunities are limited to the side on which you are seated. The second part is a walking tour of the facility guided by a former political prisoner. I appreciated that previous reviews set appropriate expectations about the content: the presentation covers all prisoners' experiences and is not focused solely on Nelson Mandela. Obviously he was not the only prisoner, although he is the most famous and there is an opportunity to view his cell.Depending on the group size, it can sometimes be difficult to hear. Our group was very polite but it helps to be close to the front.Overall the tour takes about 3 hours, and is a moving and educational experience about a tragic period in recent history."

Robben Island is not part of their Africa tour; however, SMARTours lists Robben Island Tour as an optional tour to take during your free time in Cape Town, South Africa. This optional tour suggestion was a highlight of our time in Cape Town and recommend you not pass up the opportunity. Unfortunately the ground tour operator in Cape Town did everything in his power to persuade us to abandon our plans and spend our free time paying him for a high priced tour of his own. What a disservice to a world traveler! Please do not pass up a trip to Robben Island.Robben Island is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It has been a military base, a leper colony, a mental institution, prison for criminals, and most famously the prison for Anti apartheid Political Prisoners, including Nelson Mandela. This has been such an important part of late 20th Century history. Furthermore, the tour is extremely well done. The Ferry is clean, spacious, and comfortable. The introductory video that is played en route and back to the mainland is very well done. The initial motor coach \u201cwindshield\u201d tour around the area is magnificent. Our motor coach guide and driver were will informed, engaging, interesting, asked questions of us to make sure we understood, and these men were very professional. A former political prisoner inmate inside the prison was fascinating. He deftly fielded questions and could frame the experiences of prisoners in such a manner as to give you a very genuine experience by way of his first-hand account. Without exception everyone in our SMARTour Group that ignored SMARTour guide Ron and went to Robben Island were so happy they did not listen to him and participated in the Robben Island Tour.Nominal cost of about $20 US Dollars.Very educational.Location is Victoria and Alfred Waterfront, which has many delightful shops, photography opportunities, and places to enjoy a meal. Easy access by cab from our hotel was approximately 100 Rand ($6.75)."

Our guide, as is the case with all of the prison guides, was a former inmate. All Robben Island prisoners were black and primarily political prisoners. He took us through the cell blocks-solitary confinement, including a look at Nelson Mandela's cell, and the dormitory-style rooms which held several prisoners- and explained what life was like for them.

Had been lead to believe that we would have one guide who was ex political prisoner. We were 45 minutes late to the part where the ex political prisoner guides us. He was upset that we were so late and he had to significantly condense and rush us through his experiences as a prisoner on Robben Island and a tour of the barracks where he was a prisoner and the cell Mandela was in. He was excellent. Wanted more time with him and not time with the jokester first tour guide. He had so much to share and the we all wanted to spend more time with him.

South Africa's colonial segregationist history and the role of the antiapartheid movement is important to understanding the current status of this country in the context of the global economy and world affairs. South Africa is much more than fabulous wildlife and luxury safaris, diamond and gold mines, sophisticated cities such as Cape Town, and beautiful scenery and wine. A visit to Robben Island is only a snapshot of how black political prisoners (and criminals) were treated by the white apartheid government. [the Apartheid Museum in Johannesburg is a must do!] As a tourist attraction, it's not that interesting to just see a bunch of buildings, penguins, and birds -- and Nelson Mandela's cell. The most interesting is the story told by the former prisoner. However, given the size of the group and the acoutistics in the room, it was difficult to hear his voice. They should put a microphone on him, or he should have stood in the middle of the room. The story boards were also amateurish, and could be easily overlooked but told graphic stories of the treatment of the prisoners. This museum could be so much more improved with adequate funding and could really stand as the symbol of the end of the apartheid government. Visitors should spend the half day to visit this former prison, if only to acknowledge that South Africa's political history is a crucial part of the visitor experience of this country."

The boat is simple - adequate seating inside or outside and plenty of room to move around. There is a small bar area that serves chips/crisps and a few drinks. (There is also a small store with snacks upon arrival at Robben Island.) Not that it is at all controllable, but we found the water to be a bit choppy and my wife found that she needed to be outside in the fresh air to calm her stomach. The boat ride was about 45 minutes.Upon arrival to the island, everyone is ushered to large buses to tour the island. The buses will pass by the hospital, the school, the cemetery and stop at an area for photographs. If the sky is clear, you can get some great shots of Table Mountain. Eventually the bus will stop at the prison where you will be escorted by a former (political) prisoner around some of the prison. The former prisoner gives you an idea of the day-to-day life at the prison and helps one gain a better understanding of the past political climate of South Africa.It seems unfair to give an attraction of this much historical significance a low mark on the review, but we found that the tour guides didn't provide enough background and context for non-South-Africans to really grasp everything here. We're educated, travel internationally often, and aware of politics and history, but this just wasn't a great tour."

When you arrive to the Island, you are given a tour guide who narrates and discusses the significance of different areas of the island.Our guide was a former inmate who had been unjustly incarcerated with Nelson Mandela. He spoke about their living conditions, their psychological and emotional state as we sat in one of the cells. We also toured to group cells as well as the isolated cell that Mr. Mandela occupied for 17 years before he was moved to another jail. What a historical place.After the tour you are given time to shop - of course.

I am so glad that I did. It is somewhat of a commitment if you are pressed for time. Depending on the ferry ride, the tour itself can be as short as 3.5 hours. The tour comprises of three parts. The first part is a tour bus around the island. The tour guide is very informative and gives you an explanation behind the history of the island. I particularly like informative tours and my gold standard is the architectural tour in Chicago. I found this very comparable. The second part of the tour is in the political prison itself. You are paired with a former inmate and you have a chance to see what life was like for these political prisoners. The final part of the tour is to look around Cell Block A where you read the intimate stories of some of the inmates. All in all, I highly recommend making the time to visit this former penal colony. The history and its significance can't be captured in this review, but I guarantee once you visit you'll be happy that you did."

First off, book WELL IN ADVANCE, the queue for buy tickets on site for the day is long, often with limited tickets available and you'll probably never get them. When you get on the boat to the island, note that it's a 50minute ride to the island, if you get sea-sick, bring medication as the sea can be rather choppy. There are no bathrooms, food or drinks onboard. When you get to the Island, it's a guided tour first on a bus with a ride around the island and then to the prison with a guide who is a former inmate of the prison. Our guide was incarcerated for political reasons during the apartheid uprising.The tours are about an hour each with a stop on the bus part at a cafe for refreshments, food and drink available as well as a bathroom stop. The only problem we encountered on our trip was that some people didn't seem to care if their children shouted and screamed over the guide. I found this rude and inconsiderate. I struggled to hear the guide telling us the history of this landmark while parents let their children scream at the top of their voices. This isn't the staff's fault hence not penalising on trip Advisor points, it's a great attraction and I really recommend it to anyone."

It was embarrassing to listen to others ignoring this gentleman's individual experiences to ask if he knew Mandela personally. We were taken to Mandela's cell, the only one with furniture in. Be prepared for a struggle as people stand there taking endless photos without letting others see in. Hang back wherever possible.

Sadly, the reality is so different. The highlights:  - the 60 or 30 minute boat ride (depends on the boat) to the island has great views back to Cape Town. - the tour of the prison, including a (10 second) viewing of Mandela's cell, with a former inmate telling his personal story. - that's it!The lowlights: - the prison tour was too crowded and rushed, with the guide's commentary continuing with his group still racing to catch up. Poor photo opportunities because of the speed of the tour. No time for reflection in a space that really warrants it.  - the bus tour was a waste! We waited in the bus for about 20 minutes for our guide to arrive, time clearly to be made up during the trip. A bored, disinterested, scarcely audible guide reciting snippets of information. 15 second stops at key spots e.g. the lime quarry, but not allowed to alight for photos or proper viewing, being curtly instructed to take our photos through the (grimy) windows. But we were allowed a coffee stop! - no time at the harbour to read the many interesting information boards on the history as an apartheid era prison.Of course Robben Island's role as Mr Mandela's prison of 18 years is of National importance, and we visitors are touched by this piece of history. However I do wonder without the Mandela involvement would there be these tours to the Island today? There certainly should be.Why? Because the Island is so much more, and thus has so much more to offer visitors. For example it's periods as a 17th century prison, a whaling station, a leper colony, a naval base, a sacred Muslim site; it's marine and bird life, the village, the lighthouse etc, etc.And no mention of it being a Unesco World Heritage Site!?While extremely disappointed with my tour, I'm not sorry to have visited having since dug a little deeper into the broader story of Robben Island and now believing the Cape has a largely unexploited tourist jewel on it's doorstep. One day I hope I can return and enjoy it more fully."

The whole experience takes a good part of 60% of a day which in effect takes away a big chunk of a day\u2019s sightseeing, for the sake of seeing a jail cell. Scenery and view of Cape Town whilst on the ferry cannot be beaten (if the weather is good) and it could be a spiritual experience walking in the steps of history.However, the ferry service is extremely unreliable and often break down even while at the island. Sometimes are replacement ferry needs to be sent to collect passengers, causing further delays. Personal experience as a tourist guide was that the stories which were told by the local site guides were not completely objective. Visitors were also not always treated in a respectful and professional manner."

The tours focus on the political prisoners who were kept at the island...most importantly, Nelson Mandela. The tour leaders are former prisoners. However, there is a lot of 'padding' to make visitors feel they have gotten their money's worth. Truthfully, there is not much to see. The tour guide tells personal stories and, although I value his struggle, he spoke a lot...really a lot!!!! Be forewarned that if one has any mobility issues think twice about taking this tour. There is a lot of walking to see the same gray walls over and over. They say the last walk from the prison to the boat is supposed to signify the 'Walk to Freedom', if you are not a walker, it is just really long. We were there when it was quite warm, too, so standing and listening for almost an hour BEFORE the walk to the ferry almost did me in."

I have done museums such as Check point Charley in Berlin, Aparvati ghats in Mauritius and Flanders Fields Museum in Ieper, Belgium. I had such expectations of this tour and this was for me the reason to come to Cape Town. When I travel in South Africa I find that many things are well organised and compared to other countries in the world, you find world standards. For example the Two Oceans Aquarium is world class. Therefore, I expected that Robben Island would be of the same level as it is also an expensive attraction.This is my two cents worth.-It is very popular and online tickets are often sold out and today was in the off season!-They tell you to arrive at 12:30 for 1 pm ride. But you have to wait till about 1.15pm in a very crowded setting where you cannot even find the space to look at the posters on the wall describing the history.-You are marched into a boat and in our case 'Sea princess' which is already full upstairs. You have to sit in a dark indoor area. The life jackets for the children are dirty. And windows are very dirty and have not been cleaned at least in one year. When you try to come out to the back deck, an aggressive man called John stops you and say it is not allowed. When you ask why he says 'its dangerous.' Some other people manage to sit on the back deck and then you try to go and sit. He allows you to stay after you have a big fight. The voyage is about 30 minutes and every one inside the boat are feeling stuffy, hot and cannot see any thing. Each time you want to take a picture, they treat you like a criminal and there is absolutely no customer service. This is a private company and not former prisoners. -You arrive at the Robben Island and you have to find your way to a bus. The buses are stuffy, again dirty windows and you barely can sit in a group with your family. We sat on the right hand side. The tour starts with a lady guide who introduced herself. She is actually like a tape recorder and some times she forgets what she told and repeats the same sentence. After a few minutes we realise that half of the tour is going to be in this crampy bus. And most important buildings are on the right hand side. So if you are sit on the left hand side, you cannot take pictures. They don't stop for you to get out. The stop is about 15 seconds if you are lucky and she barely explains. For the mosque in the island she said that was for some Muslim who was buried there. Later we find out that it was for an Indonesian Prince who had been a prisoner of the Dutch. What a lack of interest in history from the Guide.-When we drove past the living quarters of the staff, which is the warden's quarters, no explanation was given. Normally if you want to explain a system of oppression you must also explain how the oppressor lived as it is one of the most important part of the museum.-The bus tour stops at a snack place and you can go to the toilets. Make sure you do, as the Prison area have no public toilets. Especially if you have children. -Here you can take a picture of the table mountain or selfies on a wooden frame.- Then the bus drives through the rest of the island without much explanation and you are dropped off at the second part.-An ex prisoner comes now and takes you around. The whole thing is rushed. You get to see the Mandela cell. And in the next part where there are many cells with stories of each political prisoner, you get less than ten minutes. And you are pushed off as another group of tourists are coming.-There is not time to observe, to read, to reflect nor even to take pictures. -At the end you have to walk to the boat and you have not even time to read the big sign boats. We left at 1315 and the boats were already waiting at 1600.It all feels like a tourist trap to make money and organised without interest in history and it is such an insult to the historical significance of the place. It could have been an educational and fascinating tour if done in an interesting way with time and space for reflection.For us, it felt like a sardine packed boat, sardine packed bus and the tour with the ex prisoner was the best part out of the experience.I have pain in my heart when I think about this experience because it killed every thing I wanted to feel during that experience."

It was, however, quite disappointing. The boat ride was terribly wobbly, and if you didn't get sick from the waves, you would from the unbearable petrol fumes. I was not expecting a complete busride on the island, and it was really not something for me. The guide was very good, and his story was impressive. But still you have the feeling of being rushed through the island, stopping at the strategic locations so everyone can make the exact same picture. If you are unlucky, you have a seat in the bus from which you cannot see any of these sights. After this tour comes a second, given by a former prisoner of the island. It is impressive to hear his story, and a great way to see the prison. Yet he was performing a monologue for about an hour, while the whole group sat and listened with just three actual sights on the route. Again we were rushed past everything, although the tours in total took us 2,5 hours. So in retrospect I should have just gone to the beach."

Our tour guide was late and so we sat in the car park for an extra 20 minutes. And here's some penguins. The tour by the ex prisoner was interesting, but didn't really tell us very much. It was a little like they were just pushing us to get to Mr Mandela's cell and that was it. There's so much more history that could be told in such a better way.

I was also surprised about the tone of the tour because you can tell the guide didn't want to step on any toes and keep up the impression that forgiveness is key when you see how little things have changed since Apartheid in terms of racism and income inequality for a loft of black South Afrikaans. Segregation only ended 22 years ago and you can really tell in Cape Town.

As part of our 30th Anniversary celebrations my wife and I made a great choice in having a trip to South Africa, taking in Cape Town, Stellenbosch (Winelands) and Kariega Lodge Game Reserve. It proved to be a truly memorable and enjoyable trip from beginning to end with many highlights.We had been advised by friends who visited South Africa last year that they had missed the opportunity to include a trip to Robben Island as part of their visit to Cape Town. They had assumed that it would be an excursion they could book during their time in the area, but discovered that both of the daily trips were fully booked for all three days of their stay. With that pre-warning we had booked on-line before leaving home using the official website for Robben Island, and we were very pleased that we did.We booked an afternoon sailing (3pm) and the boat \u201cDias\u201d takes around 45 minutes to get to the island. The ticket includes an informative guided bus tour of the island and then a tour of the prison complex with a former inmate. The evening catamaran (at around 6:30pm) makes a slightly quicker return journey to the V&A quayside. The overall excursion takes around 3 \u00bd to 4 hours.The guide on the bus tour was a very personable chap who explained much of the history and layout of the island, including the lime quarry where the prisoners (including of course Nelson Mandela) worked breaking rock, the hospital and leper colony and graveyard and the house where Robert Sobukwe lived in solitary confinement for nine years. The tour also included a brief stop to see some of the resident African penguins. Robben Island is in fact named from the 17th century Dutch settlers as they named it \u201cSeal Island\u201d. The tour of the prison itself was thought provoking and poignant as our guide was Peter, a former political prisoner himself. He explained about the regime and conditions in the prison and showed us around the various buildings with his own personal insights, including of course the block and actual cell inhabited by Nelson Mandela for his 18 years of incarceration on the Island. To date, three of the former inmates of Robben Island have gone on to become President of South Africa: Nelson Mandela, Kgalema Motlanthe and the current president Jacob Zuma. Robben Island was used as a prison for political prisoners and convicted criminals from 1961. It was a maximum security prison for political prisoners until 1991. The medium security prison for criminal prisoners was closed in 1996. In the South African general election in 2009 the Democratic Alliance \u201cwon\u201d the island.For anyone interested in such an important part of recent history we would definitely recommend that you include a trip to this intriguing world heritage site as part of your itinerary."

Now that we got that out of the way-here is the deal:I took the 11:00am tour but was told to go to the marina a half hour before. I went through a security check similar to the airport, which was no big deal. Took a jammed packed ferry ride over (there are seats available). We arrive to the island and without instruction, just start walking down the street where there are buses lined up. I got on one of the buses and there was a guide and while she was friendly, I wished her speech was a little bit clearer. The guide gave a history of the island but it was not as informative, as I would've liked. Robben Island is an important part of history and felt like we did not hear as much as we could about something so significant. You ride around the island, the guide shows a few landmarks, and then they let you out at a cafe to buy a drink, bathroom break, and to take photos of the ocean and Cape Town in the distance. Finally, they drop you off at one of the prison buildings and another guide greets you, whom is a former prisoner. I enjoyed what this guide had to say. They let you roam about the jail for a bit and you can go into the cells and read about the history of political prisoners and their experience. Finally, they take you to Nelson Mandela's prison and you can view his cell. There is no fanfare, you are told where his cell is located and can take a photo. Really not a lot of information about Mandela, as I think it was assumed you should already know about his life prior to visiting Robben Island. After this moment, the guide says goodbye and you are left to walk on your own to the ferry (not a far walk). This whole excursion will takes a half day, so plan ahead."

Among all the fun, exciting things to do around South Africa and the Cape in particular, Robben Island is definitely a somber choice--however, if you are visiting a country with such an important past and a developing future, it only makes sense to learn more about its history.Our excursion to Robben Island, while certainly the most subdued activity we did, was enlightening and valuable.The whole process is pretty well organized; you can buy tickets in the Visitor center located on the V&A Waterfront. The ferries leave every half hour or so, so you may have to wait a bit if you get there just after one has departed.The ferry ride itself is nice and refreshing--you get to see lots of beauty around you (as with everywhere in Cape Town). Because the boat is pretty fast, I did not get motion sick, so if you have a tendency for that, it may not be an issue. What was an issue was that it was so windy that your hair basically ends up looking like a bird's nest; obviously this isn't your top concern when going to Robben Island, but just something to keep in mind if you have plans afterward.Once we got to the island we were transported all around by bus. Our guide was one of the past prisoners from the apartheid era (as are all the guides!) and he did a great job of pointing out important landmarks, telling personal and intimate stories of his own incarceration and also giving an overview of the island's history. We definitely learned a lot over the course of the couple of hours we spent there.It was pretty moving to walk through the prison cells and actually see where Nelson Mandela made his mark on his fellow prisoners. Additionally, we got to wander around a bit and see a shipwreck as well as the millions of bunnies that now inhabit the island.Overall, this was a great experience, especially for a history buff or a socially conscious individual interested in learning more about a very painful period in this amazing country."

We were on the first boat of the day and there is security before getting on the boat. No problem with that but they need to have people arrive earlier in order to complete checks and ensure the boats can leave on time. There were lots of staff just stood around not really doing anything. Once we got off the boat it was unclear where we were to go but we eventually got steered towards a bus. The tour guide was more concerned about the jazz concert he went to the night before than telling us about the island. This tour could be so much more. We were told conflicting things about the history and nothing was really explained well. Really disappointed about this and hope that they make some improvements."

A prison whose inmates did hard labor with a breathtaking view of Table Mountain In the background.Robben Island (Robbeneiland in Afrikaans) means \u201cseal island\u201d. The island's lighthouse is the only one in South Africa that uses a flashing instead of revolving signal light. Dutch settlers used the island as a prison before the British colonists. In 1845 lepers from the Western Cape formed a colony there. During World War II the island was fortified with guns and became part of Cape Town's defense system.Robben Island is surrounded by shallow, treacherous waters from the Atlantic Ocean that have caused many shipwrecks by forcing unlucky vessels onto reefs. In the late 17th century a Dutch ship carrying gold coins to pay Dutch East India Company employees ran amok a short distance off Robben Island. The gold that went down in that shipwreck was worth millions of dollars. Over the years some gold coins have washed ashore but the treasure remains buried in the ocean protected by the violent surf.The ferry ride from Victoria & Albert Waterfront to Robben Island is unforgettable and there is a calm and comfortable sense of camaraderie among the eclectic group of visitors. Many of the guides were former political prisoner who lived on the island for 10 years or more."

I had read \"Long walk to freedom\" and I felt it important to visit Robben Island and find out more about the Apartheid era and the political struggles.Let me start off with the logistics first: We had a 1.00 pm sailing. We queued for 30 minutes and got going half an hour late. The crossing was very rough and quiet scary for some people. It took around 45 minutes.We got off the ferry and boarded a bus once on the island. Our tour guide was funny and informative. We drove around the island, getting off at certain points for a walk around. We saw a few birds and animals too which was an unexpected bonus.We then were handed over to a former inmate of Robben Island. This gentleman had been a political prisoner for 15 years. He was a serious man and was not a guy to be trifled with. He delivered a talk on what life was like on the Island as a group of 20 or so tourists sat on the floor listening. He then asked if there were any questions and at this point things got embarrassing. He had just delivered a very powerful, passionate and informative speech about the struggle to power and the various heroes / martyrs of the cause. To be asked questions about the quality of food or the comfort of the bedding seemed to be disrespectful. He was clearly getting a little frustrated and then when a young woman who was South African and of mixed heritage showed her complete lack of knowledge about historical facts he just blew up. He berated her in front of everyone for her lack of knowledge and then we she tried to argue back he berated her again for being disrespectful to her elders. Was he a little out of line? Probably \"yes\", but were the stupid questions and complete ignorance disrespectful? Absolutely \"yes\".Anyway, she left the tour, the former prisoner composed himself and we continued the tour. We saw Nelson Mandela's cell; (just like all the other ones).We then got a slightly smoother crossing backwards.I would recommend this tour if you are legitimately interested in the wider topic. Read up a bit beforehand and I think you will get a lot more out of it,"

He takes you to key places then you are transferred into the hands if an ex inmate. The time allocated is not sufficient. Prisoner manuscripts are unable to be read as you are hurried along and the opportunity to chat with the ex inmate is limited as you are told to be back at the boat two hours later which actually doesn't leave until two and a half hours later.

The Jetty is located on the V & A waterfront in Cape Town. Various two hourly slots available and the visit is around 4 hours in total. Short boat trip to the island (30-40 mins). Then transported by a bus to the beginning of the tour (5min). A prior inmate of the prison took us on the tour, which was supervised at all times and meant we were under pressure to stay with the group to get around. The tour incorporated some talk and some time to see the cells and the surrounding exercise areas. Not enough time to absorb and contemplate what life was like in my opinion. A small tip for the tour guide is gratefully received at the end of the walking and bus part of the tour. Once that part was over, you are taken on a bus ride around the rest of the island and given a historical overview of the island and what it's used for now. There is a small church, where you can marry after a special application but only on Valentine's Day! A lovely tour, which no visit to Cape Town should be without.

My mother was moved and revisited memories of the Apartheid years informing curious tourists of the days where she was not allowed to go to Muizenburg beach...she had provided them with a first hand account of the struggle and restrictions.This was my second trip to the Island and I will continue to revisit, at times, our generation not directly affected by Apartheid need to ground ourselves once more to see how far we have come, not only as people but as a nation.Forever inspiring!"

I would recommend take the last ferry back for some amazing sunset view of the island as well as the rest of the town."

There is a bar on board the boat.Upon arriving at the island you are taken on a bus to the prison, however we felt you could walk this as it is a short distance. The guide sorry forgot your name was actually a prisoner there with Nelson Mandela so you had a first hand account of what the prison was actually like.You are taken on a bus ride of the island. however one of the last stops you are given five minutes to go to the shop and take pictures, i feel this could be a bit longer.Overall an exceptional trip and well worth the money.

The ferry out was very good with professional staff with full safety info and we very much enjoyed our sail over.It was a little chaotic moving from the ferry to the bus , ours was ridiculously full yet the one next to us was half empty, bad organisation here. We found the tour fascinating and the ex inmate who accompanied us made it a very emotional event . Due to our bus being over full we did feel like we weren't given time to fully absorb the experience at times.Overall we enjoyed this and it's definitely worth the visit but please be aware - the ferry which brought us back was no way like what we traveled out on, it was not a purposely built newish boat but looked like an ancient, poorly maintained ex fishing with cobbled together seats below deck with no windows . No safety instructions on life jackets etc. My husband works offshore and even he felt some anxiety at this sail, I think if we had been traveling with young children I would have refused to go onboard this vessel it definitely did not feel safe ."

While you'll learn that it has had other functions, such as a leper colony, the tour mostly focuses on what it was like during the apartheid era. The first part of the tour is by bus as the island is quite large; the second part takes you into the prison buildings. The latter part is led by a former inmate, which adds a lot to the information you get and the whole experience. Both guides were engaging and extremely informative. There are several breaks for restroom stops and one stop where you can buy snacks and water.  I was there right after Easter. During Easter and also Christmas the tours can fill up very quickly. Book ahead as soon as you know what day and time you want to go. The ferry trip to the island takes about 45 minutes and the seas can be choppy. We used windguru.cz to decide on the days with the least wind and the lowest swells. I recommend this if you have flexibility when you go, especially if you are prone to seasickness. The sooner you get there, the sooner you can stand in line to get on a ferry. Everyone goes through a metal detector, then you board a ferry. As soon as it is full, it takes off. We were one of the last ferries for the 9am sailing, so we didn't board until 9:30, and that limited our time on the island so we didn't quite get to see everything. Be sure to have layers; it can be chilly on the ferry. Sunscreen and a hat are a must if you are there in summer. If you need a wheelchair or a scooter you need to tell them ahead of time and they will make accommodations for you on the ferry. The tour bus had a wheelchair lift and there were lifts or ramps wherever we went."

The first tour took an hour with a refreshment stop and was very insightful as a tour.The second part of the tour was the prison which was taken by a former prisoner. This obviously has benefits with regards to having a tour from someone who's been there, but you did (perhaps understandably) get the (in our case) 5 year snapshot of their time there more than the overall 50 or so years of the apartheid imprisonment. Overall the prison tour was a good experience, but I left feeling slightly underwhelmed. Having said that, as I walked through the gate that freed prisoners did I did think about what it would mean for me to go through what the political prisoners did. "

Let's face it, we all want to hear about Nelson Mandela so it was disappointing that the guide, sadly a former prisoner, had to draw out the tour by repeatedly asking if there were any other questions. We were then ushered quickly past Mandela 's cell as so many stupid questions had taken up such extra time.

Empty, it is hard to picture the feeling of the place when it was full, and sadly photos of that time with overcrowded rooms / isolation / meals etc are rare, but still you can get a sense of the horror of the place. The bus tour of the island itself was also well guided and the politics explained carefully to us. We went the day before to really read all the stuff in the room you leave from where the tickets are sold and I would really recommend this. We knew a lot before we went, but we still learned a lot. I think the placard with the different amounts of food for the different races, and the length of trousers for blacks/coloured/whites hit home hardest for me. Definitely worth a visit."

Departing by ferry from the V&A waterfront, the 20min trip to the island offered some of the best views of Cape Town. Once in the islands, the tour is divided into two parts: i) a walking tour in the prison lead by a former political prisoner, and ii) a bus tour around the island. The tour led by the former political prisoner was the highlight of the experience. It was very personal and heavy, but a great honour to us that our guide would share such an emotional and harrowing story of his time as a prisoner."

You know - stuff that all sounds good on paper.Sadly, the reality was disappointing. The ferry departed 25 minutes late from the Waterfront, for reasons unknown. Once we docked at Robben Island, we were shuttled into a number of tour busses, each with it's own (non-political prisoner) guide. The first part of the tour entailed us being driven around in the bus, looking at the Kramat, the lime quarry, the leper graveyard from the bus itself. No opportunity to get out and spend time in the quarry, to add a rock to the pile that Nelson Mandela started. No opportunity to browse the tombstones and get a sense of the poor souls who died there.We were allowed out of the bus at Robert Sobukwe house, given about 10-15 minutes to explore his prison house. Original letters between Robert and his wife made for touching reading. The next stop was a comfort stop for a snack and a toilet break with the opportunity to take photos at the Robben Island \"photo frame\". From here it was back into the bus and off to the prison where we were introduced to a former political prisoner. It was all very rote and almost scripted. We sat in F block and were shown the food that the various colours of prisoners were allocated, and shown the prison card system.We then shuttled past Mandela's cell, very much on a take one photo and move on quickly basis. And that was pretty much it - back to the ferry where we waited about 40 mins before leaving. We were back at the Waterfront at 5:30 instead of 4:30pm and it just really was a disappointing waste of 5 hours. It has so much potential, but is very poorly thought out."

This made the experience more chilling, more real and so much better for it. The horror that he was able to put across was a \"hairs on the back of the neck\" moment that I will not forget any time soon.He was able to make the tour come to life, especially when he took us into the communal cells where the inmates were allowed to associate at the end of their terrible working days.Yes, of course, we saw Nelson Mandela's cell. But that really was only a small part of the whole experience.The second part of the tour is a coach tour around the rest of the island. Be ready to be surprised with all of the other aspects of the island - in addition to the prison / Mandela aspect.Such a great trip.You MUST experience this and see where the world changed, if you come to Cape Town."

The booking section is a bit hap-hazard as the tours are listed as 9am,11am, 1pm and 3pm.We phoned and booked and were told to be at 10-30 am for the 11am ferry.However the ferry left at 10-30 so be aware that the times can only be guidelines and tours tend to overlap at times so it is best to set aside a day for the V and A Waterfront and connect with the tours which depart from the Clocktower Nelson Mandela Gateway.The ferry ride is quite pleasant and the trip is about 30mins.The weather can play a big factor and if the wind is howling or the waves are crashing, the tours may not operate so it is not advisable to book too early as tickets are valid for day of departure only and cancelled tours may be validated with a bit of arm-twisting perhaps?Once you disembark there are busses that move tour groups around in short stops and at each stop the tour guide will give a brief or detailed description of the events that occurred.We had a female tour guide with a lovely voice and she was impeccable with her narrations.There was also a female bus driver so the fairer sex is in the mix although I don't think that there were female prisoners on Robben Island!The visit to the main prison and the cells can be very touching and emotional and can have one picturing what those brave men like Nelson Mandela, Walter Sisulu, Ahmed Kathrada, Jacob Zuma , Mac Maharaj and many others went through on a day to day basis when imprisoned on this desolate barren island which has no resemblance with any island paradise whether in the Caribbean, the Bahamas or Ile Maurice!The one little house where the leader of the PAC was imprisoned solo and was not allowed to speak to anyone even the wardens was too traumatizing to contemplate entering and exploring because of the inhumane sentence that was handed out to the poor man.Other places of interest were the leper graveyard and the limestone quarries which was responsible for damaging the eyes of the inmates as they were made to break stones as part of the punishment.The tour guides in the prison section are ex-inmates and they do a very good narration of what went on in the life of an inmate on the island. The tennis ball episode was masterful!There is a tomb or Kramat of an exiled Prince of Madura, Sayed Abdurrahman Moturu who was sent to exile from his country in the East possibly Java or Indonesia in the 17th century by the Dutch and he eventually died on the island.This noble hero was one of the 1st Imams in the Cape and political prisoners always paid homage to the saint when leaving the island.It is recommended to visit the shrine, enter through the gate and remove shoes when entering the door. Once inside pray with a dua or supplicate any prayer or just meditate in the peaceful solitude of the tomb.There is a shop which sells memorabilia and other tourist items and also food and drink snack items and cards were also accepted.Stop at the entrance gate to Robben island when walking back to the jetty for selfies and photos.A definite experience not to be missed is the Robben Island tour and the only reason we could not do it in the Cape visit of 1981 and 1985 was that it was still inhabited by political prisoners and only visits were of family and more prisoners to the island."

However, it is somewhere that everyone should visit, to learn about the history of South Africa. The prison guides are all former prisoners, who are getting older, but the plan is to teach their children to be guides too. Our guide was very embittered that his struggles had not resulted in the changes that were promised, and so many of his people were still living in unacceptable conditions in the country of their birth. Change is happening, but much more slowly than was anticipated when I was in South Africa 8 years ago. Then, there was a sense of optimism, now there is more a sense of frustration. This is why it is important to go to Robben Island and learn about he history."

Our tickets only cost about $30AUD each so we were fine paying that just for the ferry ride but the rest of it felt like a bit of a waste of time and perhaps we could have found a better activity to satisfy our curiosity about the history of the region. I hear the District tour is good.Pros- Ferry ride to and from the island was beautiful- Really interesting stories on the walls of the ferry terminal- Former Robben Island prisoners now host the tours so it offers an added element of emotion to the tourCons- Confusion from passengers moving from the ferry to the buses- It was challenging to understand the guide and there isn't any catering for those who don't speak English (our entire tour was French speaking people except for us and they all struggled)- Minimal signage or explanation about different areas - Lack of opportunities to use restrooms (a boy actually peed in his pants because there were no toilets for +4 hours)Give it a shot to tick it off the list and support the former prisoners - but don't expect much from the tour or you will be disappointed."

On our 3rd afternoon, we took the free shuttle from our hotel to the V&A Waterfront area, to take the Robben island tour. The tour begins on the mainland with some historical information and pictures that you can read/view while waiting for the ferry to the island. You then board a ferry to take you to the island. The tour consists of 2 parts -- part 1 is on a bus, which drives around the island, stopping at the various buildings to provide the history; part 2 takes you into the building containing Nelson Mandela's cell (set up as it would have been when he was there) -- the tour guides are former prisoners, and their personal stories really do make for an informative visit.NOTE: Would strongly recommend booking a ticket on-line for the date/time that you want to take the tour -- there is limited capacity, and it sold out quickly (several people in our tour group were not able to get tickets when they arrived) ALSO, allow enough time -- the ferry ride to & from the island takes approximately 45 minutes each way, depending on how rough the seas are, and you need 1-2 hours for the tour on the island.

Speaking from experience, the guides are able to answer any question and have a unique perspective on life during their own incarceration. In addition to seeing Nelson Mandela's cell, you'll see remnants of the island's history as a leper colony, incredible wildlife, and a community where many of the current employees live today.

I think both tours (bus around the island and prison tour) are slightly off-script and therefore I'm sure somethings are missed out. I could be wrong. Making it more scripted would work for these types of tours. Especially the prison tour which no doubt includes some personal experience of the the guide, which though important to them is probably not the most important stories of the prison. A lot of visitors will want stories of more high profile political prisoners and I think they could be added into the tour in a better way.Nevertheless still an excellent tour and I would highly recommend."

It is about 4 hours from when you get on the boat to when you return, but in retrospect, we were glad we took the time to learn the political history. It could have been a slightly shorter tour, spending a bit less on the bus trip on the island or in the prison. It may seem like I was trying to speed up the trip, but there is no way that you can only go to the prison or only do the island tour, you have to do the whole thing. There was a little snack shop in between with drinks and snacks, which was good to have, and the rest rooms were OK also."

You see a small amount of the prison, including Nelson Mandela's small cell and you learn about the conditions and history by the guide, who was also a former prisoner on the island. You don't get to freely move on the island as much as we hoped, you get shuttled by bus from the prison, to the rock quarry and past several important buildings while a guide explains the historyGo pick up tickets early, as tickets sell out quickly. We got there around 10am and the next available ferry was at 1pm. There are a limited amount trips that the ferries make. There were three ferry boats per session, so we weren't all cramped onto one ferry which was good because it is at least 20 minutes by ferry from the port to the island"

Robben Island is best known as the place where Nelson Mandela and many other political prisoners were incarcerated during the Apartheid years. It is located in Table Bay about 12 kilometers (7.5 miles) off the coast of Cape Town. The island is now a museum and a World Heritage Site and it can visited as part of a tour that starts with a boat ride from the Nelson Mandela Gateway at the V&A Waterfront. Robben Island played an important part in South African history and it's in my opinion an essential visit when in Cape Town.During the boat ride, which for us lasted about 40 minutes, you get to enjoy wonderful views of Cape Town and Table Mountain. Once you arrive on Robben Island, you embark on a guided bus tour around the island. During the tour you are told about the island long history as a prison and as a leper colony. The island served as a jail since the mid-17th century when it was used to held political leaders from various Dutch colonies. Two very moving stops on this tour are the house where Pan African Congress leader Robert Sobukwe was kept in solitary confinement and the limestone quarry where Mandela and other political prisoners did hard work during their imprisonment. After the bus tour, which lasts about an hour, you are dropped at the gate of the prison where you are met by a different guide, usually one of the former inmates who will show you around the prison. The guide will talk about the daily life of the prisoners on Robben Island. The fact that our guide was a witness to what happened made the tour very moving and personal. At the end of the tour we were shown Mandela's cell. Nelson Mandela spent 18 of his 27 years of imprisonment on the island. In order to visit Robben Island you need to book a ticket. We visited in February and they were fully booked for a week in advance. I was lucky to find tickets for the last day before our departure. So if you're visiting in summer my advice is to book early.Robben Island's harbor also has a colony of African penguins which we didn't get to see. My kids were tired after having to keep quiet and still for 3 hours :) so we headed back to Cape Town."

Seeing the quarry and the minute cells was not something you can experience from books and the coach trip round the island was well presented and hugely informative. As so many want the experience volume is an issue and the hydrofoil carries a few hundred at a time who have to be dispersed in a small island and eventually come coach load by coach load into a narrow prison corridor. It is hard not to feel herded. The ex prisoner enriched the event but you wanted to ask him questions and one was all that time would permit. Organisation was good although our 300 boarding left at 345. There was good information at the departure and finding out more about the history of the island was a bonus and the trip was good value for money at 300 rand for a full half day."

During the week we were there this happened a lot, so we very lucky. The visit is really very good. It is in two parts, the first a bus tour round the island showing areas such as the limestone quarries where prisoners had to do hard labour, and then a tour of the cells including the cell Nelson Mandela was incarcerated in for years. The cell tour is conducted by ex prisoners which brings the whole thing to life in a very graphic but incredibly engaging way. The ferry takes around 30/35 minute each way.

The stories and conditions are hard to believe especially when told by a passionate ex prisoner who went through it all and survived.

As there is a limited number of visitors that each tour can take, you should prebook your tickets in advance. That is the only sure way to guarantee you will not miss out this tour.As you queue for the ferry to take you to Robben Island, take some time to look at the exhibits hang around the queueing area. We were lucky that during our ferry ride to Robben Island, a whale was sighted. The ferry even stopped for a while for the sighting. A pleasant bonus for the whale sighting.Upon reaching Robben Island, we were instructed to get up on the buses. The guide on the bus who was giving the explanation of the various point of \"attractions\" was an ex-prisoner. I was quite surprised that we were not allowed to get off the bus to see the various points of \"attractions\" at a close range. But I guess, the previous generosity of allowing visitors to get close to these sites were abused, hence, the drastic measure of such is taken. So depending on where you are seated on the bus, you might not even be able to take a decent photo of the sites. Before the bus went back to the prison building, a short stop was made for toilet stop, shop and also some exhibits. I feel that the time for this stop can be shortened so that the rest of the tour for the prison facilities is not so rushed. Another ex-prisoner took over the guiding when we reached the prison facilities. Of course, the highlight is to see Nelson Mandela's prison cell. On the whole, I really enjoyed the history lesson that I had hearing from our guides, who had first hand experience, as they shared their experience with us. However, the whole tour felt very rushed even though the tour, including ferry rides is about 3 hours. We did not even have time to see penguin on robben island or to walk around the place on our own. Maybe the management or the tour operator can review the whole tour and see how to improve the experience of the visitors. "

He told us his story of his time there and the political conflict during the time. He shared his thoughts on Mandela and what has been achieved since the end of apartheid. I can't explain in words how incredibly privileged I felt to be in his presence, but what I will say is that this is an experience I will take with me in whatever I do in life.Thank youPS Book in advance!"

It was like being back in grade school listening to someone just talk about the event. We're here! Take us around the prison, give us a couple of facts at each locale and let us be here and experience it with you.It feels like an us vs. them mentality instead of an experience to see what happened, to step in and live for a moment the lives of those so important to change in South Africa.I'm sure over time this will improve, but for now, they take everything they have to offer and hide it behind classroom lectures. I wouldn't take children under 13 to the current rendition.It would actually be a truly amazing experience if they did one of those auto tours in the prision, where you go from section to section and get a basic rundown of the importance or purpose/relevance to the cause for each.You are there... you should experience it first-hand, not have it lectured to you as it could be from any classroom in the world."

And to be there now, knowing all that has gone on since 1990, and gradually discovering what happened in the years from the Rivonia Trial to Mandela\u2019s release in 1990 \u2013 well it\u2019s a significant series of thoughts.

Only the official boats go over to the island 4 or 5x/day with a no option guided, structured tour. The wait to get on the boat could take up to 45mins. 2) I don't get affected by rough seas but, some of the passengers got VERY sea sick (and threw up) on the 40min passage. I would recommend taking an anti sea sickness prophylactic if needed. Possibly the passage is not always rough but, it was rather rough the day we went. 3) the tour is given by a former political prisoner which makes the experience very impactful. 5) When you get to the Island and get off the boat, make your way as soon as you can to the busses so you can get a seat that you want. 4) this is only a partial (if you will) of the apartheid suffrage. I VERY strongly recommend to take a trip to the district six museum (also in Capetown) and if headed to Johannesburg, a trip to the apartheid museum (phenomenal) and Soweto (Mandela's house) will put it all together.

Remember to bring your caps, sun tan lotion and lots of water! The ferry ride was amazing! We caught whales along the way! And we heard stories of the prisoners first hand from their very own prisoners! COOL stuff!"

We were kept in a communal cell for longer time given a lot of information but did not see the museum as expected. We were then taken to the late Mr Mandela's cell. We spent less than ten minutes there to take pictures and were told to leave and our tour ended there. Every time I visited the museum the tours were not the same. The tours at the museum were not standard and we missed some valuable information. I consoled myself that the money I paid was for the sea cruise not for the museum, which defeated the purpose of visiting the museum."

The trip out is like a seaside holiday: blue skies, blue waters, we even saw some whales and dolphins. Then the reality of the place hits you - hot, dusty, desolate. You are shown round by a former prisoner who details just ow dreadful conditions were, even after the International Red Cross had been and insisted that inmates have a t least a blanket to sleep on. The harshness of the regime is brought home by the regulations about food - not much for anyone, less for blacks than for Cape Coloured (Indina, Malayan and mixed race), and the unrelenting heat at the quarry were people laboured for nine hours a day.Yes, it is famous because Nelson Mndela was there, but in the block where he was held and scores of similar cells and each one has a picture of a man held there and something about his life and the way he endured his imprisonment.It's impossible not to be moved by this experience and for people of a certain age (like me) who remember the anti-apartheid movement - the protests, the marches, the Wembley concert, the exhibition at the ferry terminal brings it all back very vividly."

In fact there were several boats all going at once and they were all busy! Our boat took about 40mins to reach the island and we all disembarked onto a fleet of coaches, each with a guide, taking us on a tour of the island. After various stops you end up at the prison itself where the bus guide hands your group over to an ex prisoner. Our prisoner guide told us what it was like to be incarcerated there and also to leave again! When asked why he became a guide, he explained he felt their story had to be told to the world. The guide spoke at length and with a fairly strong local accent which some people might find hard to follow so you might want to read up about the visit in advance so you are familiar with the history. On the way back we travelled on a catamaran which was faster and you have the most amazing views of Cape Town as you sail back into the harbour. The whole visit takes 3 to 4 hours depending on how long you spend there. Take a jacket for the boat as it's breezy and leave time to explore the harbour area which is packed with shops, restaurants and hotels."

It is the location of the infamous prison where Nelson Mandela and other political prisoners where held during the apartheid years in South Africa. As you would expect, it is a place of great significance for South Africans. It has been accorded World Heritage status by UNESCO. The people at the hostel recommended that I book ahead to get a ticket. My tour started at 1.00 p.m. The boat to the island was not what I expected. It appeared to be a \u2018working\u2019 boat, with limited places for the passengers to sit. Prison Ship The trip out to the island took about 50 minutes. There was quite a large swell. As we drew into the harbour on the island we could see a number of other boats. They all looked like your typical harbour cruise boats.Once on the island we were directed to a line of buses. Once on board we were greeted by our Guide. He looked like a young Nelson Mandela. He asked which boat brought us to island. Someone old him it was the \u201cDias\u201d. He explained that the Dias was one of the original \u201cprison boats\u201d that were used to transport supplies to the island. It was also used to transport the prisoners to the island. Tour of the Island by BusThe bus took us past the prison and to an area which the guide explained was the site of a leper colony. The island housed the colony up until the 1930\u2019s. It must have been dreadful to suffer from leprosy in those days. I note that it has been determined that leprosy has been determined to not be very contagious. I guess that leper colonies were a bit of an overkill. Robert SobukweThe bus then stopped at a house. The guide explained that house was where a political dissident by the name of Robert Sobukwe was held in solitary confinement. He was famous for leading the resistance to the \u2018pass laws\u2019. This was system under apartheid wherein the Blacks were issued with identity passes that were used to restrict where they could live and travel within the country. The guide told us that as part of his solitary confinement Sobukwe was not allowed to talk to anyone, including the Warders that were guarding him. Towards that end of his incarceration he was visited by the anti-Apartheid activist, Helen Suzman. The guide said that he met Suzman when she visited the island shortly before her death. She told him that Sobukwe told her that he was \u201cforgetting how to speak\u201d. What an extraordinary form of torture solitary confinement is. Lime quarryThe tour took past the Lime Quarry, where the political prisoners were forced to work. The Guide explained that the educated prisoners used the \u201crelative freedom\u201d while working in the quarry to teach the illiterate prisoners to read and write. He also explained that the dust and glare at the quarry caused eye damage to the prisoners. Penguins and Great View We stopped for a short break the northern end of the island. From this point there is a great view of Table Mountain. You can also see some of the local penguins. Apparently their numbers are declining and no one is sure why this is occurring. Large gunsHeading back to the prison we passed a large gun, one of three that were placed on the island during WWII. Of course these guns never fired a shot in anger. PrisonThe bus dropped us off at the prison. We were met by our next Guide. This gentleman was really interesting he was a former political prisoner. The Guide explained that the prison had several blocks. The prisoners of different categories were held in separate blocks. There was a block for the \u2018Coloureds\u2019 (mix race) and the Indians. The \u2018Blacks\u2019 were held in separate blocks. The \u2018Leaders\u2019 like Nelson Mandela were held in a separate.The first block that we entered was where the guide was kept. The \u2018cells\u2019 were large. Up to 20 men were held in the cell. The prisoners slept on blankets placed on the floor. There were no beds. This practice ceased under pressure from the Red Cross and it was causing the prisoners to contract TB. The next block was where more \u2018dangerous\u2019 prisoners were held. This block has single cells. On the walls of the cells are cards will short stories written by the inmates. They are all harrowing. Guide tells of his Personal Experiences While we were in this block, the Guide fielded questions from the group. This was very interesting. He told us about the controls that the Warders placed over their communications will the outside. The sending and receiving of mail was very restricted and all mail was read and censored. He told us about one particular Warden with whom he become friendly. This Warden took the Guide\u2019s letters and smuggled them off the island and personally sent them to the Guide\u2019s family. He also encouraged the family to send him letters that he passed to the Guide. The Guide told us the \u201cthe Warden is still alive and is one of his best friends\u201d. The last part of the tour of the prison was where Nelson Mandela was held. There is a quadrangle next to the block. The Guide explained that in the corner of the quadrangle was one of the spots where Mandela hid the manuscripts for his book \u2018The Long March to Freedom\u2019. Where the original fence was being replaced will a stone wall, the manuscript was discovered. Mandela had to re-write that part of the book. Clever use of a Tennis Ball The Guide also told us about the tricky thing that the \u2018Leaders\u2019 used to communicate with the other prisoners in the adjoining Block.They used to play tennis in the quadrangle. They cleverly placed written messages inside one of the tennis balls. During the course of the game they would hit the ball over the wall into the next block. The prisoners in the next block would reply to the message and throw that ball back over the wall. Apparently this went on for years. Notwithstanding the Warders saw the ball going over the wall and being returned, they never twigged that it was being used for communication. Mandela\u2019s Cell The final stop on the tour was Nelson Mandela\u2019s cell. I always find it a bit eerie to visit a famous place in history. This is one of those places."

It was a very hot day, there is no air conditioning and our guide, who was a lovely man, was very talkative. At one point I was next to the window in full sun for a stop of over 15 minutes and it was unbearable. He was also very quietly spoken so I missed much of what he said.

The tour gives a fascinating and moving insight into a divining moment of South African and world history. The tour starts with a 45 minute boat trip to the island, on which we were fortunate enough to spot a whale. You then get a guided bus tour around the island, and a guided tour of the prison in the company of a former prison inmate. You get to see the tiny cell in which Nelson Mandela spent 18 years imprisond on the island and the lime quarry in which prisoners did their daily hard labour, many going blind from the sun's glare in the process. A very moving and at times disturbing experience but not one to be missed."

This trip contained four seperate parts all making one great experience.First, a beautiful boatride out to the island. Taking in CT from the water is great.Secondly, a guided bustour of the island and the history of the island, a lot of new knowledge came to me.Third, a guided tour by an ex-inmate at the maximum security prison. Interesting perspective as it was first-hand. Genuine! Nelson Mandelas cell could have any old cell, they all really look the same...Fourth, the boatride back in the afternoon. The sea as woken up and as my 6 year old said, \"Dad, this is like a rollercoaster on the water!!!\" It was rough but well worth the 45 minutes.Go visit!"

You can only see the island as part of a tour, which is more or less well organised. The trip over was rather slow, but this was more than compensated for as we saw a whale. Swimming and blowing through it's spout just in the harbour area in late February. Amazing! The tour starts with a drive around the island on a bus, followed by a tour inside the gaol by an ex prisoner. This was fascinating, although our guide got a little too repetitive and lecturing towards the end. Still, given his experiences you had to give it to him. The trip back was a bit of a mess. We got on one boat, got herded off and had to wait in the full beating sun for 2 more boats. Not sure why the trip back didn't work the same as the trip out, but we made it."

I have always had a love of Nelson Mandela and have read just about everything I can about him, so no trip to Cape Town would have been complete without a trip to Robben Island. I was very nearly disappointed and I would stress the need to book in advance. We were visiting between Christmas and New Year which is a popular holiday time in South Africa, we didn't realise you could book online and we very nearly didn't get a ferry as these were all showing as fully booked. In the end we had to contact a tour operator and take a bigger tour which included the Robben Island visit. To be honest the Rand is so weak against the British Pound that it really wasn't that much more to do it this way.The trip over on the boat is spectacular with Table Mountain in the background, dophins and whales swimming in the bay. We even saw a couple of sea lions.Initially I thought this was just going to be another tacky attraction but I am so pleased they haven't ruined the authenticity of the island. It pretty much remains as it always has been and the tourist shop and cafe is well hidden away from the main part of the island. The atmosphere is calm and peaceful which was not something I expected.It is sobering to think that our guide was actually imprisoned for 18 years on the island. He had no bitterness or antagonism towards his captors and you felt his pride in the role he was now fulfilling. I found the whole trip extremely emotional and I will never forget the experience.Advice: Don't take small children. We had the misfortune to be in a tour with a few families with pushchairs, the children pretty much screamed the whole way around and eventually were asked to leave. It is very disrespectful when your guide is trying to give you the history and the stories related to his time and you can't concentrate due to the screams and cries of tiny children. Please have more respect.Overall the time for the tour including the ferry is 4 hours and it is well worth the time. Take lots of sunscreen as it gets very hot in the Summer and there is little shade."

It was more neutral than we had gone in expecting, but that was likely dependent on the tour guide.Our tour was at 3PM, and although it says we must arrive a half hour early as the gates closed 10 minutes before departure time, we ended up leaving nearly a half hour later than scheduled due to the number of visitors.Make sure to bring a jacket with you because the boat ride can be very cold! The men who took us over on the boat though were very friendly and kept us entertained. They even started offering to take photos of couples, and we ended up getting some lovely shots from that bumpy and freezing ride over the island =)Upon arriving, there are bathrooms, a small snack shop, and a curios shop before you get on the bus. We were under the assumption that we would be doing a lot of walking around, but instead, you get a tour guide who takes you around on the bus to all the important buildings and sights.Unfortunately, I cannot remember our guide's name, but he was fantastic. Very informative and knowledgeable, but also entertaining; clearly, he's been doing this for a while...! He was a member of the PAC, and through his job as a tour guide, has had the privilege of taking the likes of Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and even Nelson Mandela himself (when Mandela returned) around the island. With our diverse tour group, he was able to tell us how each our countries was connected to Robben Island, which was very interesting as the information reigned from the the Axis powers military base during WWII to Australia's Eucalyptus trees that have taken over the island. Overall, I appreciated his take and information on the island. The only downside to the bus tour is that we only got off the bus once for just a few minutes for a washroom and snack break. The second part of the tour focused on the political prisoners led by a former prisoner. He showed us around the group cells and isolation cells where Mandela stayed and shared with us his story of how he ended up on Robben Island, as well as the day-to-day life of a political prisoner. It was very interesting to see the conditions in which they had to live and work in.(The only thing that put a slight damper on this whole experience was the parents who didn't watch over their young daughter. She sang and hummed for a good portion of the bus tour until even the tour guide had to shoot her a look, as well as sang and danced around the group cell while everyone else was listening to the guide speak about his experience. The parents did nothing to move her aside or keep her quiet.)Overall, a great tour and highly recommended."

They will definitely have to improve a few things if they want to keep tourists coming to the Robben Island.I did enjoy a few things but overall I missed a lack of information and communication, the long waiting time without been informed what is happening, the feeling of battery chicken that is certainly efficient for never proactive and a time will come when people will longer be interested.

Mandela spent 18 of his 27 years in prison on the island, the prison's prisoners were at the forefront of the fight against the abominable apartheid regime. Thus, the island has rightly been designated a UNESCO world heritage site. It should form part of any trip to Cape Town. At the moment, however, the Robben Island experience feels like a missed opportunity. From the woefully outdated and seemingly dangerous ferry transportation, to the rushed and inadequate tour around the island, (which failed to explain the context of apartheid or bring to life the stories of the many prisoners who were kept there.) This tour should be about education, the tour guide did his best, but if you knew little about apartheid before you arrived, you left none-the-wiser. The bus journey around the island felt tagged-on and slightly bizarre. Little information was given about the history of the island, but for example, we were informed about the state of the local school and other stories about residents who currently live there. The bus tour concludes at the limestone quarry pit where Mandela and other ANC leaders were forced to perform back-breaking labour. It was a place where they defied their oppressors and discussed politics and ideas. As visitors to the island we were shown the pit from our bus, we couldn't enter or take pictures, it felt rushed and pointless and it did a disservice to those brave men were imprisoned there. Further to this, the ferry back to Cape Town seemed a little dangerous, many passengers were choked by diesel fumes, and we seemed to speed into choppy and dangerous waves at every opportunity. It was not a comfortable journey (nor was it for my girlfriend who was very green by the end of it.) To be honest I am less worried about the intricacies of the transport or the queuing, but by failing to properly educate, explain and bring to life the horrors that took place on Robben Island those responsible are failing Madiba and those who were imprisoned there."

He took us through the prison and told lots of very informative stories. The whole tour was great but I felt really rushed. We never had time to get out and actually read some of the signs posted in various places. I would have liked to do more walking instead of bussed around and craning my neck to see out the windows. The girl on the bus (can't remember her name) was also excellent."

            "review": "Informative and Emotional. Our trip began at the Waterfront Mandela Robbin Island destination center, which is in the middle of a ton of shops, cafes and attractons. It is a safe area during the day with lots of security to help guide you around. They ask you to arrive 45 minutes before your scheduled time, and there isn't anywhere to sit...they line you up on stairs. After walking all morning, we just plopped down on the steps along with everyone else. Finally, we were boarded onto the ferry. I must say, the ferry we had to take us to the island (there are several) was awful. No seating and it was quite packed. A little scary by American standards, as there weren't any flotation devices that we could see and many people felt uncomfortable with no where to sit or really stand except on ropes. The staff were not helpful and a little rude to passengers. It is a rather long ride, at least 45 minutes, but the views are awesome. You might get lucky like us and see the seals playing around, or a great white attack a seal (not pretty, but it is a sight watching nature do its thing) and we even saw several whales, even though they were off season. Dolphins also put on a show. Once you arrive on the island, you then are boarded onto buses. As the driver navigates the island, a former Robbin Island apartheid prisoner will tell you about the history of the island and it is quite emotional listening to his stories. After a brief break to get a cold drink or snack on the waterfront (great pics at that stop), you ride the bus again to finish the island tour. Then they take you to jail. Literally. It is a dingy, bad vibe feeling place. As you look around, you can enter cells and read about their former occupants. So many stories of respectable men, locked up because of their color and desire for equality. It is easy to put yourself there and think about what it must have been like for them. It's hot and horrible. After meeting with another former prisoner and hearing his tales, they take you past Mandela's cell, which you can't enter, but can take a picture. The whole tour from wait time on shore to the return trip takes about 4-5 hours, so eat before, bring a shawl for the boat, but dress cool if you are there in summer. It is damn hot and sticky. Some people felt it was way too long, and I think I agree because people started losing interest late in the day. Thankfully, the return ferry was great, complete with lots of benches and two bars. Just hope for that ferry. Worth the trip and time. And there is a plentiful gift shop at the end of the tour, of course, where you can buy anything Mandela related, including books and videos."

I wanted to look around more and talk to our guide but at the end we had to run for the boat and missed it which meant we waited on a follow up vessel (which actually was a bonus as we had plenty of space and were able to enjoy the bonkers swell and headwind on the return leg).It is a museum and should be preserved but could do more for visitors (timing needs improving, more chance to look at exhibits and soak up the history, better signage etc).

When we came ashore we entered a buss that drove us 5 min where we met up with our guide - a former political prisoner of Robben Island. His description of what had happened on Robben Island was very interesting and captivating. It would have been interesting if they've told more about the differences between ANC and PAC and the prisoners at Robben Island. The entire trip takes between 3,5 and 4 hours."

What a shame the Robben Island tours website makes no mention of this useful facility for visitors who don't have printer access.Another tip: Get downstairs to the embarkation area early to give yourself time to read the interesting wall displays charting the struggle against apartheid. It will put your visit in context.Be ready to go through an airport-style metal detector before boarding your boat, and put your backpack through an x-ray machine. Inevitably this seems to catch people out, causing needless delays.We went on the last trip of the day at 3pm and would definitely recommend it for an unhurried experience, with no later groups chasing us through the prison tour.

The last over 10 years ago.We were subjected to a two hour bus tour with a droning guide that loved the sound of his own voice. We were only permitted off the bus for 5 minutes, to take photos of table mountain and use the facilities. Other buses stopped in various places, and allowed passengers depart, take pictures and experience the surroundings. Mr Mohammed had a captive audience, and let's just say, he really made the most of it.On arrival at the place we all really came to see, we were now on a tight timetable that didn't give the opportunity to really get the best from the visit alongside our fantastic guide in the prison.I was saddened that 2hours in a cramped bus with a droning guide ruined what was to be a highlight of my partners first trip to the Western Cape of Africa.Genuine thanks to our guide in the Maximum Security Prison. His humility, strength of character and dignity were in stark contrast to our time on the bus.To our bus guide..... Mr Mohammed, you need to recognize how to read your audience. When they are on the phone because you are boring them..... take notice!"

We took a 30 minute boat tour to Robben Island to find out more about the place where Nelson Mandela was incarcerated for 17 years. With the Rand at 25 per 1\u00a3 it was a very reasonable price for the ticket and we were lucky to see dolphins and whales along the way.The communication when we arrived on the island was poor and we nervously took a bus that was waiting as we disembarked from the boat. During a 40 minute journey around this tiny island we were treated to a captivating narration from a guide about the history of the island and how countries from around the world had helped to achieve the end of Apartheid. While were there we saw native penguins and beautiful birds with fantastic views of Table Mountain.The most impactful experience was visiting the jail where Nelson Mandela spent 17 years in a very small cell with nothing but a bucket, mat and three blankets to sleep on. The tour guide Sparks was a previous convict and elaborated about the experience of being locked away, only released to work in the Lime quarry for no apparent purpose. This was a very though provoking tour, it helped to explain an incomplete history for me and I feel was an important part of a fabulous holiday experience."

You'll then stay in this group for the rest of the tour and this is the only reason I've dropped this to four stars. It is not easy to take any decent photos on the first part as you tour the island as you don't get off the bus so probably best to sit on the left rather than right side. Once you get off the bus you'll take a tour round the cell areas with an ex prisoner guiding you. Amazing earring and seeing some of the stories and conditions these humans were submitted to just because they wanted equality but stay close to him so you can hear what he says. The size of the group again doesn't help and e missed the cell that Mandela was put in as we were at the back (it's the one with the bucket in on the right by the way!!).Overall a great history lesson and one that is all very humbling."

We booked at the last minute through our concierge at the Westin Hotel and the tour was heaps cheaper than organised tours through our cruise ship the Queen Elizabeth, It cost just \u00a315 each. For that we got a boat trip to the island, a tour by coach around the island with a wonderful tour guide who knew Nelson Mandela and had shown Hillary Clinton and Obama around. The second part of the tour was with an ex prisoner and the highltight of the tour was Nelson Mandela's cell. Clean toilets and an enjoyable sea trip back to the Victoria and AlfredThere are 183 species of birds, so bird lovers will love this.."

The most disappointing organised tour we have ever been on. When enquiring about the time of the crossing (1.00pm on our pre-booked ticket) we were told our boat would be leaving at 12.30 so entered the queue and waited \"motionless\" until 1.05pm. More or less herded onto the boat (the crossing there and back was probably the highlight) arrived about half our later marched to buses (see other reviews on quality) and because we had the temerity to read a few of the interesting posters on the wall relating to the imprisonment were left on the last half full bus. We then were told we would have to wait until the next boat came in before we could leave on our \"tour\" another 30mins. From that moment on all the guides we came into contact with were \"clock watching\" obviously concerned with getting us through the system. Our ex-prisoner guide must have glanced at his watch about 30 times in a thirty minute tour of the prison. No time to take in the atmosphere....to stand and contemplate.......move on next please!!!!"

Not that it mattered, it left first but they both got there at the same time.When we arrived, they directed us to our bus. It was well organised and never felt chaotic or crowded. The prison tour was first, then a bus trip around the island.Our ex-prisoner guide was passionate and good humoured. Although his aggressive questioning might be too much for some, I found him amusing. He had an exceptionally strong accent which meant we really had to concentrate. We understood about half of what he said which was enough to get by.Robben Island isn't exactly something I enjoyed, but I wanted to see it and I'm glad I did. I was surprised how small this prison was. It was a somber experience but we found this two part tour interesting and informative.Near the end of the bus tour, there's a shop that sells drinks and snacks. My girlfriend also bought a couple of books for R20 each which she was happy about. There is also a toilet here if needed. And as a bonus; we saw Dolphins, Penguins, Seals and Whales on the boat across. So keep your eyes peeled.Iain, London"

We basically spent an hour on the bus learning nothing. This was a hugely missed opportunity for us tourists to be educated!Then we were met by an ex-prisoner who gave us a prison tour for another hour or so. Myself and most of the other people in the group did not understand a SINGLE word this guy said because of his poor English pronunciation. He might as well have been talking gobbledegook.

The trip moves too quickly over the poster section where you need time to understand what happened on the prison island. The guides are sweet but not understandable as are the prisoners. The ferry that we returned on did not have enough seating on the main deck, a perfect choice to get out of the cold and I ended up on the floor. Certainly learning about Apartheid is a needed story but poorly told and executed. Do lots of prepping before you take this and plan to spend 2-3 hours more than suggested."

The boat ride out to the Island was fine but then you are immediately shuttled onto buses where many seats don't have a view outside. There are all of these really interesting places to see along the way but you just drive by them. Once you get off of the bus, you head into the actual prison area where Nelson Mandela was held. One of the previous inmates tells his story, talks about the treatment of prisoners and shows you around the complex. It is very interesting, informative, and gives you a lot of perspective of what happened just a few decades ago. Once that was over, they released you to go back to the boats. They didn't really encourage you to walk around the Island, I felt like I was being shuffled from place to place from boat to bus, to tour, back to boat. There is a small gift shop which was very nice but I would have liked to have spent more time on the island. Overall it was a great experience but I would have liked to spend more time out of a bus."

Booking in advance is certainly advisable - it was necessary for us to book 4 days in advance. It takes about 40 minutes to get there by boat and on the way we saw several dolphins and many fur seals. Sun screen is a very good idea. The guide at the prison / museum is usually an ex-prisoner and it is interesting to hear their stories. The tour of the island is by coach, stopping at several different locations, which if like us you will see whales, seals and penguins. The only down side is that on your tour of the both the prison and island you will be part of a group of approximately 50, which makes it difficult to see and hear at times. Nevertheless, a well worthwhile visit."

The prison tour is quite short, but the details given by the guide are very emotional. what I did not like is the fact that the guide kept telling some members of our group to mind their children, who were only whispering from time to time, being kids"

It was so hot on these buses, one elderly passenger starting to hyperventilate. Fortunately, a doctor and nurse was on board to assist her. We were taken on a short drive around the area then stopped for 15 minutes at a shop/canteen. We were then dropped off at the prison and a former guard took us for a tour. Unfortunately, his English was not good and the tour was too long in the heat and far too many people in the tour. I would not recommend this tour until the organization is better. Many tour companies do not use this excursion any longer and one has to privately arrange it. The tour group we were on would not organize or recommend it. It is a shame as so much history is on this island."

We visited Robben island with our reluctant older teens and early 20's children who we were very keen to educate on the history of apartheid and why and how Nelson Mandela and others spent years imprisoned here. At the end of it they said (and we agreed) that it was a monumental bore, and a missed opportunity to educate people properly. We were driven around on a 33 degree day on a bus used for prisoners back in the day, with no airconditioning, and seats that you couldn't see over unless you were by the window. With 5 seats across (with very high backs) most people couldn't see a thing. There was one stop on the long tour at a nondescript place to buy drinks etc (with many things - all icecreams for instance - sold out). Our guide could have been good but had such a thick Xhosa accent (and I grew up in South Africa and could barely understand her) that all the international visitors could not follow. We had to ask her at the rest stop to please give more of a background on apartheid and who the people were that she was referring to, as she just spewed out names without any context or explanation as to who they were for those that wouldn't have known. Could not wait to get off the bus and actually walk around a bit.The cell block was the only part that was really good, with a brief tour of the cells and exercise yard by an ex prisoner who was very informative and a great guide. It was only then that I saw my kids, and all others on the tour, become engaged and get anything out of it.We then just missed a ferry pulling out to go back, and had to wait in the boiling sun for another one for 45 minutes. No shade, no seating at all for the approximately 150 people waiting, and no indication of when the next boat would appear. We have done the Alcatraz tour in San Francisco - with headphones for everyone with any language you like, the sounds and anecdotes from prisoners, etc etc. While I didn't expect Robben island to be at the same level, the management of this tourist attraction really need to lift their game and make this tour far more engaging and informative so that visitors leave knowing so much more than when they came - because we certainly didn't. And my kids hated it."

They fill the buses up completely so groups/families would need to be early'ish on the bus to be sitting together. (Each bus load of people are taken to the jail at different times to space out the tours). At the jail say goodbye to the tour guide and bus driver and meet your next tour guide. The tour guides for the jail are former political prisoners and at the end of the prison tour he told us his personal story. After this you walk a short walk down the hill to the wharf to the gift shop and ferry. Time: We were in the queue for the ferry about 8.45am and back by 1pm.

The group was too large and on several occasions conflicted with other groups. Some groups travel in the same direction as other groups whilst others are moving in the opposite direction. The acoustics are very poor in some areas and because of the size of our group it was impossible to hear the guide clearly. No provision was made for non English speaking visitors which must have a long term detrimental effect on international tourism.The displays are second rate and already suffering from the impact of the climate. A few basic display boards with no time to read them does not make a visit an informative experience.Robben Island needs to step up its game. Free movement of visitors and the provision of individual audio guides, in languages other than English, would dramatically improve the experience. Professionally produced displays, including audio visual presentations, as at many world class visitor venues, would make a visit to Robben Island worthwhile.

What a story he told.It all notched up a few more gears when we visited the prison block and yard where Mandela was incarcerated. Our guide here was also an ex-political prisoner (14 years in prison and 7 years as a guide) and he told great stories, but in a totally different style to our first guide.The whole trip lasted nearly 5 hours, and we couldn't have spent that time any better.My only comment on the experience is that I think Mandela's legacy is gradually being squandered (but that is absolutely a personal opinion)."

Not only the 'centrepiece' of the prison tour, but also the bus trip around the island, which gives a whole other dimension of the island's history, but also the other groups who were isolated here - the native chiefs, the lepers and even the homeless. Enjoyed the photo opportunities back across the bay, and just the little things like seeing a tortoise cross the road to a bus stop!However, would advise parents to think twice about bringing small children with them, as the bus can be hot and the ex-prisoner's talk is quite long - and at times, explicit - for children. Realise that there is often no option if you want to come as an adult though."

We hadn't booked booked before arriving in Cape Town, and when we tried, we were told that it was all fully booked until after we were due to leave. However, we decided to head down to where the ferries depart by V&A Waterfront and try our luck, and as luck would have it we found a couple trying to sell 3 spare tickets they had, there were 3 of us, it was fate.We got on the ferry and away we went, it's an enjoyable ferry ride with some stunning views of Cape Town and Table Mountain.On arrival on the island, you get onto some old busses and you do a guided tour of the island, our tour guide was knowledgable and funny, he really engaged all us passengers. You stop half way on this leg of the tour at a shop with toilets, stunning views of Cape Town and Table Mountain and loads of penguins hanging out. Then you complete the bus tour.After the bus tour, you go on a walking tour of the prison itself, and all the guides are ex political prisoners, who did their time on Robben Island. So you get a very informative (straight from the horses mouth so to speak) and passionate tour.Before heading back afterwards on the ferries, there's time to visit the souvenir shop and buy some souvenirs.I would say this less than half day tour is a must if you're in Cape Town."

My only regret at the time was that we were not allowed to get out of the tour bus at the lime quarry, but on reflection I understand that if over one thousand visitors every day did so then 'tourist damage' would occur.At the prison itself a former detainee escorted us round, ably explaining the relevance of the different blocks and showing us the various cell blocks. It looked a harsh environment and one can only imagine how bleak life must have been for those incarcerated.Inevitably, everyone wanted to see Nelson Mandela's cell. The fact that it was just like the others served to emphasise how his reputation in the outside world counted for nothing with the prison authorities.This is a key site in the struggle against apartheid and should not be missed when in Cape Town."

The tour actually is designed to take 3 - 4 hours (I had thought it was only two hours, so had arranged something else back in Cape Town) - we discussed my dilemma with the guide and he kindly agreed to take us independently to the Mandela cell and give us a quick look around and then get back on the next ferry to the mainland.

But if I spare one person the awful experience of going to robben island I've done my job. This whole thing is very poorly organized. I felt as if we were the first tour to ever occur there. No one was able to tell us where to go, or how long our tour would last. Last loading was at 10 minutes till the hour. At the hour, we were still standing in line doing nothing. After we loaded We took a nice boat over with a nice safety demonstration and life jackets under our seats. When we exited the boat, there was zero direction. Imagine 300 people on a random island and not a soul saying \"go this way\". Nothing at all. Some busses came up behind us and started driving through the crowds but there was no one to say hey go here go there etc. it was so confusing. There was clearly a high priority party who had special treatment but who knew what they were up to? They seemed to get whisked away with their special bus driving right through the crowds. Anyway. Finally a random bunch of people loaded on a bus but we did not know why. Then another couple people with official looking badges came up and stopped us with no directions and waited for about 10 minutes to let the loaded busses pass. We were so confused. Finally a guy said hey we are starting the tour now. His accent was awful. I'm very well travelled and can decipher just about anyone's speech. 2/3 of what he said was unintelligible. One and a half hour later we had completed an absolutely horrible tour of the prison. Then they told us we need to get on the bus. The tour guide called the bus drivers by yelling at them. They did not want to come. They were only 100 yards away. 10 minutes later the bus arrived. We loaded on the bus but were too many and there was standing room only. That's when they informed us that we can not stand. So they called a 2nd bus. We offloaded the first bus and then we loaded on the 2nd bus. Then began another hour long tour of the island with a new guide. He was better but at this point- I just wanted to go home. Little did I know it was 2 more hours before we were done. Finally we make it back to the boat to go home and they put us on a very different boat. This time there was no safety demonstration.this time it was an open air boat with no life jackets. And people kept pouring on this boat. If that boat had trouble we were screwed. It took over an hour to travel back on this very slow overloaded boat. And the exhaust stack was belching diesel fumes down on the crowd on the deck. I was not enjoying this at all. If they had simply done a self guided tour with plaques and signs it would have been fine. No need at all for guides. The guides sucked anyway. A hop on hop off boat that came and left every hour would have been great. We could have turned our 5 hour+ experience into a nice 2 hour enjoyable excursion."

The name is Dutch for \"Seal Island\". Robben Island is both a South African National Heritage Site as well as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.From the dock, a bus will take you around part of the island and then come to the prison buildings, including viewing of the cell that housed Nelson Mandela for 18 of his 27 years in prison. The tour guides are prior prisoners of the prison during Apartheid. Three former inmates of Robben Island have gone on to become President of South Africa: Nelson Mandela, Kgalema Motlanthe, and current President Jacob Zuma. Following the tour, you have the opportunity to walk through the grounds on your own. This is a half day activity."

As soon as we disembarked, we were herded on buses and driven around the island. The guide on our bus was informative and humourous - especially about the most famous toilet in the world in the lime quarry where the prisoners held clandestine meetings.Then we were handed over to a different guide- another former inmate - who showed us around the prison buildings at a breakneck pace and managed to lose at least half the original group. He was very difficult to understand even though I managed to keep up with him. We kept running into other guides with other groups and backtracking. He did say that there was more people than usual on the island that day. I'm not even certain that we saw Mandela's cell as our guide pointed vaguely to a cell and just kept walking, saying that there were many, many prisoners! Interesting comment.It is worth a visit but would have liked a less 'herded' frantic approach."

What also fascinated me was to see a painting of Jesus Christ on the walls in the prison cells, that shows that prisoners had faith even in their hardships, they still believed that one day they will be liberated!!"

It is very interesting for all tourists to visit the island for, obviously, Mandela's cell and the tour around half the island... it's unfortunate that the other half of Robben Island is not visited as there are seals off the northern coast. I'm a local and have been out four or five times; it's always fulfilling. I remove one star for the poor guides (ok, they're ex prisoners and all) but their language skills, especially for foreign language speakers, are quite poor. They are sometimes hard to understand. Kids get tired of trying. The jokes on the bus are tired and unnecessary. Altogether a valuable and informative few hours."

If you are going the summer time, and if possible, make sure you book it ahead of time, I waited 4 weeks before going to book and only got a 7:30 am ferry, which was hard on my kid, but so worth it. it was so touching to see the prison, after watching the movie \"Long Walk to Freedom\", it brought it all together. The icing on the cake was that the tour guides are all ex-political prisoners, our guide, Tom, was incarcerated for 9 years, while Nelson Mandela was there. Such a touching story and helps you understand the struggles that SA has had for so many years."

To really understand what the freedom fighters went through, the inhuman conditions they were subjected to,then a visit to Robben Island is a absolute must.It is only accessible to tourists via a ferry that sails at different times of the day. This excursion will take about 3 hours of your time but is worth every minute. As you sail to Robben Island, you can look back at a spectacular Table Mountain, but as you near the island you feel some sense of premonition as you are now almost in the middle of nowhere. Once on the island a well informed guide ( I came to know later that he was also imprisoned at the very same prison) will take you through all the stages of the intake, the courtyard, the holding cells to the open workplace where prisoners like the late Nelson Mandela,had to chip away at solid rock almost every single day of their imprisonment.The cell where he was held captive is still in it's original state and it is really mind boggling to comprehend how a man of his stature and built had to sleep in a cell that he could not even stretch out!That is just one of the atrocities and I won't do justice to prepare you should you go and visit this island. The Island is now renowned for the multiple Valentine's marriages.For more shocking revelations I suggest you experience it personally."

The life of Nelson Mandella is why you visit Robben Island, although the island itself long predates Mandella's incarceration, serving as a provisioning stop for mariners and also as a leper colony, long before becoming an isolation place for political prisoners as well as ordinary convicts.The ferry to the island is quite enjoyable with good views of Cape Town, but it could be a challenge if there are rough seas in the bay! The island divides into a prison, and a village for the guards and their families. Today visitors are required to take a tour guided by former political prisoners, who tend to become quite emotional about their experiences. How Mandella survived 28 years, mostly in solitary confinement with hard labor (breaking stones) is amazing."

We took the first ferry over in the morning, there were queues when we arrived half an hour early! The ferry takes around 25-30 minutes and there's enough seating for everyone, it's also a great photo opportunity if you are near the back as its open. Once you arrive at the island you are put on buses and given a tour which shows you where the school, hospital etc are located. There is a guide on the bus at all times. After around 15 mins you stop off at the cafe to get a drink, snacks (crisps etc) and there's toilets available too. After ten minutes you are back on the bus (which can be very hot and stuffy) to complete the rest of the tour. The bus drops you off a the prison / cells where one of the inmates gives you a short talk on life inside. Once the talk is completed you are shown Nelson Mandela's cell. The tour is then completed and you make your way to the shop / boat ready for departure. The whole event including the ferry lasts for around 3 hours. This tour isn't a must do in my eyes, there's lots of more interesting things to do with your time, I think this is just a money making exercise."

It's hard not to recommend a trip to Robben Island, as it's historical and cultural significance, to SA and the world at large, is unquestioned. However, if you only have three or four days in Cape Town, I would not put it at the top of your list. Plan for it to take a full five hours - starting with the queue for the boat and the ferry (if you get the fast one, it's about 25 minutes. The slow one, closer to an hour). Once you get to the island, you are shepherded onto tour buses that drive around the island, with a few stops and led by a tour guide. We found this part disappointing - it would have been much better to be able to walk around the island and check out the prison and other buildings at our own pace. The last third of the tour is by foot, where former inmates guide you into the cells. This is the highlight and still a moving experience. If you have a week or more in town, you should definitely go. But Table Mountain, Kirstenbosch, Cape Point, Boulder's Beach and Lion's Head should all take precedence. Also to note: the V&A Waterfront, though impressive in scope, is primarily a large outdoor mall. If you've been to many parts of America, it will be familiar."

It is a process to get to the actual prison. First there is a que in Capetown where you are placed on one of three boats. We arrived very promptly and originally were thrilled to be placed on the first large boat \"The Jester\". As the Jester chugged along slightly choppy water, we began to see the boats that had loaded later pass us-- a 25 minute ride took almost one hour due to our decreased speed and the fact that there is only one dock to unload on2. Once you arrive you are placed on a bus for about an hour tour. This was surprisingly interesting. There is no official line for the buses and it is a total free for all when the buses arrive-- Once we finally managed to push our way onto the bus we enjoyed the tour and our guide.3. The prison is very interesting but our guide was incredibly difficult to understand due to his heavy African accent. I'm sure he was telling an interesting story but I understood about 40% -- I'm sure if the tour had been longer my ear would have grown accustomed to his accent and understood more. However, the actual time inside the prison is not long. I would recommend the following to improve this site--1. consider improving the boat situation-- a slow and choppy ride is not ideal2. Set up stanchions to organize the cue for buses. 3. provide written material about the prison experience and perhaps bios of the guides--"

During the bus tour, if you were sitting towards the back of the bus, it was often quite difficult to hear even with the microphone. Try sitting towards the front and by the window for best view. During the prison tour, there were 30-40 of us with a single guide which made it very cramped, difficult to hear, and slow at times.Top Tip: even though ticket recommends arriving 10 mins before departure, try getting there 30 mins early to get outdoor or window seat on the boat - great views during a clear day!"

The tour conducted by a former inmate was intriguing, informative and provides the visitors with an insight into life in prison on the island. The only thing on my bus was no PA, he apologized It the start but found it sometimes to hear what he was saying. We saw the lime rock quarry, that brought this fairly bleak site to life only did work under harsh conditions, Large part of the first half the tour spent on a bus listening to a highly entertaining talk then you could hear him.The second half was the prison visit itself, well we left the buses for good. we got out and toured inside the main prison buildings and courtyards, involves a fair bit of walking and then sitting on benches inside the former prison where Mandela, amongst others, was held. The guide another former prisoner, who told us about daily life in the prison. then it was time to see the actual cell where Nelson Mandela served some of is time.My only criticism of the trip was that it could be a bit rushed at the end depending as to how long your ex convict spoke during the prison visitwhich meant no time a visit the shop and no time as well of souvenirs.I would strongly recommend it to anybody who visits Cape Town to make the trip. I would recommend the whole morning or afternoon to do trip, take some comfortable footwear and hat for the sun."

Robben Island is the place in which the late Nelson Mandela was incarcerated from 1964, spending approximately two-thirds of his prison time there. Mandela was just one of many individuals forced to labour at this location.I booked my ticket online before touching down in Cape Town. This is essential during the peak tourist season. A useful tip is to arrive well in advance of your tour time, enabling you to get to the front of the queue and pick your spot on the boat that departs from the Nelson Mandela Gateway. I stood at the back, affording me excellent views of the beautiful waterfront but the boat was so fast that I ended up kneeling, fearing I might topple over the edge!The tour began with a highly informative bus ride around the island. The place is much bigger than it looks from the summit of Table Mountain! Sights included the Leper Graveyard (leper colonies were admitted to the island during the second half of the nineteenth century) and the Lime Quarry. Personally, I found it particularly discomforting to learn that prisoners\u2019 eyes were damaged by the reflection of the sun from the latter. Prisoners were deprived of the rights other humans would expect and eye protection was not provided.The island is an important wildlife habitat and although I missed the understandably reclusive penguin colony, I did spot a tortoise. This, along with the picturesque scene of waves crashing against rocks with Cape Town in the background provides great photo opportunities.The second part involved a guided tour of the cells by a former inmate. This was a humbling experience. It was an honour to shake the hand of someone who had survived such an ordeal. He was asked whether he bore any resentment towards the individuals responsible for his incarceration, and responded with remarkable humility. Somewhat inevitably Mandela\u2019s former cell is a considerable draw. Most people in my large group wanted to photograph it.My time on Robben Island nicely complemented a trip to Alcatraz I made in 2014. It\u2019s worth knowing that whilst Alcatraz was predominantly self-guided when I was there, my Robben Island tour was escorted at all times. Rather than compare the two any further, I would say that both provided remarkable, valuable experiences. Site visits today ensure that the suffering of former prisoners is not forgotten as time moves on."

Didn't understand that but wasn't overly bothered. There are 3 or 4 different sized boats used to get to the island. We travelled out on a small one - like an overflow when busy. Fantastic flat crossing taking about 25 minutes. The island harbour stinks of seagull waste. We were marshalled to the right side of the pier and jumped aboard an old bus. The tour was lead by a young man living on the island - he was very informative and humourous. We visited a small shop for refreshments. Great photo in the frame with Table Mountain in the background. The mine was like visiting a concentration camp. Very humbling. The internal prison was orderly and informative. To be honest, it was nice to hear about all the others that fought the cause, not just the great Mandela. The talk was by an ex inmate, who did a good job of making us feel how it was. Then it was all a bit rushed. We were told to get back to the port on foot as the boat was leaving. Flew past the souvenir shop, and boarded a large catamaran. We got back to Cape Town much quicker on this fast boat. Overall - a humbling lesson in history, and I'm glad we did it. If you're really pushed for time in Cape Town, maybe this one could be a lower priority?"

It's too regimented: only 3 boats a day, herded onto buses on the island, rushed round the prison so you can be on the boat back to the mainland. Phew ! Don't get me wrong it's very interesting and poignant. But how about more boats, time to look around the prison at your own speed, perhaps offering audio tours as well as former inmate guides and better signage ? For me the visit was rushed and as a consequence the impact of the place was somewhat lost. Glad I went but won't have a lasting effect. Shame really."

We left at11am and returned back at the V&A at 2pm. Departures to the island start at 9am, then 11am, 1pm and 2pm. It takes about 30mins from the V&A to cross over to the Island. Before we board the ferry a photographer takes a photo of us next to the ferry, which we will need to collect upon our return. A fee of R40 (\u00a31.76) is imposed. Once on board the ferry and before we depart we are given a quick demonstration on safety precautions aboard the vessel and how to put on our life jackets in the event of an emergency. When we arrived at the Island we were met by our tour guide and then we boarded our tour bus to the island. The guide commenced telling us about the history of the island. The Island is famous because it is where President Nelson Mandela served 27 years Imprisonment. Other inmates included President Jacob Zuma and President Kgalema Motlanthe. Robben Island's History is linked to South Africa as a whole under colonianist and apartheid rule, the racial and class inequalities that transpired within the country and resistance to this. There were so many human rights abuses, suffering and injustice which were encountered by prisoners, including segregation and no bread for breakfast. The Island was declared a National Monument in 1996, a National Museum in 1997, a World Heritage in 1999 and a National Heritage Site in 2006. On the island there is a White Limestone Quary where Nelson and other Prisoners had to work on whilst shackled. During the day they would break the quary stone and carry it to one end of the quary and then bring it back in the next day. This process was done to keep the prisoners busy. Nelson Mandela worked with white Limestone Quary for 13years, and as a result he developed eye problems. When he was finally released people were not allowed to use flash photography when they took his picture. Mandela and his inmates used their time in the quary to educate themselves from literature, philosophy, history and various events. One of the prisoners Robert Sobukwe was kept in solitary confinement for 3 years for his part in urging blacks to repeal pass laws made during the apartheid. On the island there is a 'Leper Cemetary,' where people with leprosy were buried. There is also a Moturu Kramat Mosque where Muslim political leaders pay homage at a shrine build to commemorate Sayed Abdulrahman Moturu, Prince of Madura, Cape Town's first Imam who was exiled on the island in 1740 and later died there in 1754. You will see houses previously occupied, various prison quarters, a church which was designed by Sir Herbert Baker, a school, a lighthouse, antelope, seabirds. You can visit Nelson Mandela's cell, Prisoner's shower blocks, toilets, sinks. The tour of the Island and prison are led by guides who were formerly prisoners. They will take you along the footsteps of Mandela in the Notorious B section. Mandela's cell is left open whilst others are locked. Deep emotional encounter."

I came down from abroad with my partner for a holiday to visit my family and wanted to show him all the sights, including the Robben Island museum. We booked the tickets beforehand by phone, which was quite difficult because the lady kept getting our names wrong and generally made the process complicated. Eventually we confirmed the date and time, but when we got to the desk, we were informed that we were late and that we had missed our tour. The lady we spoke to on the phone had given us the wrong information. In trying to remedy the situation, the lady at the desk was very unhelpful. The only thing she did was shove a complaint form at us and said that if the offices think the reason for appealing is justified, they will reimburse us. Naturally we never went on a tour or ever heard from them again.The only reason I have rated this museum a \"3\" is because I have been to the museum on previous occasions and the museum itself is interesting and everyone should see it. However, the service is terrible and attitudes in general are disgusting. I feel embarrassed to bring foreigners to my home country knowing that, despite it being quite pricey, it's a gamble on whether or not the people running these establishments actually know what they're doing."

This could be a truly great tour where visitors could learn about apartheid and Mandela etc, but instead it's an overhyped boat trip followed by a mindless shuttling around an island...It starts when you line up to get on the ferry. Even though you have pre-purchased your ticket, don't be surprised if you're in line for 45 minutes - the ferry does not depart on time. The ferry ride itself is OK although there are only 20 spots on the \"viewing deck\", after which you get to sit in the bottom of the ferry like cattle. Once you get to the island, you get on a bus which drives around the island with a host whose English and knowledge of the history is limited to the script he follows. The bus stops at 5 places along the way which have no real significance to Mandela or Apartheid. You are then let out at a \"rest stop\" which is basically an excuse for them to put up a shop where you have to buy drinks/food. After this, you get the prison tour by an ex-political prisoner. Our guide spent 20 minutes asking everyone where they were from and making some lame joke about each country. We then walked into the prison yard and into a large cell where multiple prisoners were kept. The only thing our guide told us was how much they talked about politics. NOTHING about the history, nothing about apartheid, nothing about what happened every day. We then walked down a hallway and he pointed out Mandela's cell. To be fair, it could have been any cell since there are no distinguishing marks or numbers on the cell. The worst part of all was at the end, the tour guide stood at the gate to the prison with his hand stretched out looking for money. For anyone visiting Cape Town, I would highly recommend you skip this. There are FAR better things you could do with your time."

I was showing friends for the first time and apart from the guide at the prison and the guide on the bus it was very disappointing. They missed the house Madiba was in and his relationship with his guard, they skipped glad the island and the prison tour was a mess. You used to walk from the harbour and enter the same way as prisoners and get a feel for the place. We were driven 200yards in a ratty bus for no reason other than to have more people ambling around. All cells have been painted and stopped of any authenticity where before each one told a story and had mementoes. We were left to wander about with no real input from anyone. We didn't get to the shop until the boat was leaving so missed out. The boat out was late leaving (9:40 not 9am), so we were rushed. The boat back was an old one and so slow the next boat beat us back. The lack of scheduled times threw out afternoon plans into disarray. The gift shop half way round is a waste of time and it advertised books it didn't have. The information about the quarry was scarce to say the least. I visit Cape Town frequently and will never go back to the Island. It has been a cash cow for the many and lots of staff just stood there not bothering. Very sad that somewhere so important in South Africa's history has become a petty cash box for those running it. There was little emotion. Very upset and disappointed and will not recommend to anyone."

The organisation of the embarcation and disembarcation of the ferries was inefficient and the weakest part of the trip. We walked first with a guide who had been a prisoner there so could speak eloquently about the history and the experience. We were shown around the high security prison which is well-cared for and where the political prisoners were kept. Our guide finished with a challenge to the \"born-frees\" i.e. those born after 1990 ish: the prisoners have forgiven their white captors, but have the \"born-frees\"? Moreover, he quoted Nelson Mandela on the destructive effect of bitterness and hatred. Quite an amazing experience.Then there was a bus tour which was quite quick. We could easily have spent another three hours there and we would recommend that people leave their group afer the formal tour and just explore and read the many displays."

I was deeply moved as to how people like him could even be passionate enough to come as a guide to those from all over the world and step back onto the grounds that probably were the darkest days of his life, just to educate and inform people what he had gone through. It certainly brought a whole new level of respect to these people, Nelson Mandela included on how they had endured the tough times until the days where freedom for them was fought & achieved."

There is a guide on the bus that tells you about the places. I had a very interesting, knowgalable and funny guide. He also claimed to have seen Nelson Mandela personally. His stories were very fascinating and he interacted with the passengers on board, to show that every country had a part in shaping Robben Island. At the final stop on the island we got out and toured inside the main prison, where Mandela, amongst others, was held. The guide changed to a different one, who was imprisoned in Robben Island when Mandela was there too. To get to the island, you need to buy a ticket in the Robben Island Museum that is at Waterfront or online. The cruise sets off from the lower floor of the museum and lasts about 15-20 minutes."

Even rougher.We disembarked and made our way over to the coaches. I was disappointed to get one that was almost full. But we got a window seat and so it was fine. Our guide explained that he didn't normally do the tours but they were short and so he had been pressed into service! As soon as he started talking the coach was in thrall. He had met everyone and seen everything and had a story not only about s load of supposed celebrities, but also each country the tour party came from. So stories about, Mr Mandela himself, through Hilary Clinton - please don't let her be the next President - to Mr Obama.his delivery was excellent and we all enjoyed the coach ride. We got off at the prison and were met by a former inmate who was to be our guide. Unfortunately he didn't project his voice and so most of the tour was a struggle to try and make out what he was talking about.We then had to almost run to make the boat back. We walked quickly from the prison and made it by about 10 people.So, go for the history, and the part it played, not only in the making of modern SA, but also for the previous three or four hundred years."

The bus then drops you at the prison where upon disembarking you are greeted by your tour guide who happens to be an ex-prisoner. This is where the tour gets very interesting. Our guide was fantastic. Funny yet very knowledgable. We got a real sense of what the prison must have been like back in the day. Some of the stories he told were both tragic and amusing. The boat ride back to Cape Town was a bonus as we followed a whale for around 10 minutes. All in all the whole half day tour was worth it but certain aspects could be improved (or just slowed down)."

The boat trip to and from Robben island is spectacular on a clear day - there is something quite haunting about seeing Table Mountain standing out in stark splendour against a blue sky. It must have been a terrible reminder for those incarcerated there, whether prisoners, or leprosy victims to be so near, but yet so far. My biggest disappointment with both trips is that you are only allowed limited access on the island. There is so much of historical interest, but you are not allowed to get off the bus - even to take photos - until you get to the prison where you can walk around with a guide and take photos and see Mandela's cell and the yard, with its interesting history of the political prisoners. (Photos are from first trip in 2011)"

The tour of the island was very interesting and we found we knew very little about the history of the island - we thought it was like Alcatraz but the island houses more than just the prison. The tour of the prison itself was the highlight. It was incredibly moving to be shown around by a former prisoner. They're the only people who can explain what it was really like and I found myself moved to tears on several occasions.

The guide pointed out animals, buildings and plants. Frequent stops for photo opportunities. However, it was difficult to follow what she was saying at all times.

Members of our group who were from other countries could not follow him at all. Much more information should have been provided through static displays as a minimum.

She was right-the museum is modern but goes back in time to remind us of darker times in SA.. It tells the story of Apartheid,the struggles,Mandela and many other political prisoners . There was a special,and moving exhibition and film on the anniversary return visit of many of the prisoners to the island in 2005 .

It's a huge part of the history and a very important site.Book in advance as it sells out quickly. Don't just show up expecting to go out as you will likely be disappointed. The water is pretty rough normally, and if it's really rough or it's raining, apparently the tours get cancelled. People were sick on board so I don't know how bad it has to get for them to cancel.If you get a chance to choose your watercraft, avoid the Jester. It's old and slow. I took the Thandi coming back and even though it left after Jester, it passed it handily and arrived much sooner. The less time you have to spend on those rough waters the better!It's organized chaos when you arrive at the dock and board the buses that take you around the island. Don't just take the first bus they tell you to go to. They sent me to a bus that was full where there was a nearly empty one right beside it and I boarded that one instead, getting a nice window seat right up front.The guide will tell you a bit about the island and its former inhabitants, stopping at a few points of interest including the stone quarry where the prisoners worked. Then you go inside cell block B and see Nelson Mandela's quarters and get an explanation from a former prisoner how they were treated.All-in-all a very interesting and powerful visit.

On the only day that the ferry was running because the channel between Robben Island and Cape Town had calmed, the ride there was beautiful and offered great views of Table Mountain, Lion's Head, Devil's Peak and Cape Town. The ride back, however, was a total E TICKET (for those of you who remember Disneyland in the 50s and 60s). The sights on the island are limited, but the tour, led by former inmates, was absolutely fascinating! Our tour guide had been imprisoned on the island for 6 years immediately following Nelson Mandella's transfer to another facility on the mainland and brought the atrocities of South Africa's former apartheid government to life. It is a story of survival, inspiration, guts and shear determination that must be kept alive! I wondered how old our guide was, but when I found out that he had been arrested and convicted when he was 20 years old, this man who appeared to be in his late 70s was only 51 years old! What a shock! This is living history. NOT TO BE MISSED!!!"

One thing which was common to both Lionel, and our guide on previous occasion was that they did not seem to be resentful of the experience,and in some cases they ended up with an education which would normally have been denied to Black South Africans. Another comment Lionel made was with respect to the different diets for White, Coloured, and Black prisoners. Well worth the visit"

Then back in the coach and back to the prison propper, where a former inmate gave a talk at various stages of the tour. The group was huge as the one was joined by another, making the visit less pleasant as translations were also being made. Nelson Mandela's cell was proudly pointed out for photo opportunities. The penguin colony which apparently exists on the island was ignored, but then given the size of the groups ( transported in four coaches) this was probably better for the birds.

The sea crossing can be quite choppy, so bear that in mind - although it usually takes about half an hour from the Victoria and Alfred Waterfront. The tour of the island begins with a bus trip around a number of notable sites (Robert Sobukwe's house, the limestone quarry, lighthouse), followed by a guided tour of the prison. I was shown around by a former inmate, which made the experience all the more special. It was hard to comprehend that Nelson Mandela spent 18 years there - and in such a small cell with nothing more than a flimsy mat, a couple of blankets and a bucket."

Best part was during the section led by the former political prisoner held on the island. You're free to ask questions, and please, have the nerve to ask whatever's really on your mind. The answers to the difficult questions are the best. Would have been nice if there were different \"paths\" you could have taken. Walking tours of the quarry, for example, instead of seen from a bus. Perhaps there are, but I wasn't aware of them. Seems to be a one-size-fits-all 4-hour tour.The museum within the ferry building, on the other hand, was excellent. Make sure you take the time to go through and see it. No worry about crowds; don't think people pay much attention to it."

We caught the ferry from the V & A waterfront and the ride over was about 30mins long and quite smooth, something I was very thankful for as a sufferer of motion sickness. The first part of the tour was guided by a former prisoner on the island and provided a lot of first hand information. The second part was a bus ride around the island visiting various spots including the actual prison cells in which Mandela and many of his fellow political prisoners spent many years. The ride back to the V&A was possibly one of the worst experiences I've had on holiday in a long time. The waters were rough and the ferry was much smaller than the one we'd been on going to the island. People were struggling to maintain their balance and many, including myself, left the ferry with an extra package - regurgitated lunch. I would advise EVERYONE to take this trip atleast once but I'd also advise taking a motion sickness pill if you are taking this trip"

Note the ferries leave before your tour time so you need to be there at least 30mins before. The visitor centre in the waterfront is nice as are the boats out to Robben island. The tour has two parts. A bus tour round the island and then a tour of the high security prison with a former inmate. Both were good and well organised but it's a lot to take in and I felt a bit rushed and would have liked a bit more time there than I got. Particularly in the prison and time to take in the information by the pier. I believe there is future plans to enable stays in houses here and there are other ways in which this could be more developed as a visitor attraction. Overall though, i do recommend it but from reading some of the reviews I feel I should point out, this is not a tour about Mandela. You will see his cell but there is so much more to take in. Finally it's also worth saying that this tour will (on good days) give you amazing views back to Cape Town so although you can do this on a rainy day I'd recommend you plan it for a good one. Also keep an eye out for whales as you cross!"

I found this very moving that having served over 20 years in a prison on an island they are still willing to devote their lives to the place!! It is amazing though to have first hand experience from those who were there, but somewhat sad.You spend quite a bit of time on the coach and you are shown the different buildings. The highlight is at the end when you are taken to the main high security prison where Nelson Mandela was and you get to see the cell where he spent 12 out of the 27 years. They have clearly re-painted and done the place up somewhat, which kind of takes away the authentic edge from the place making it almost feel like a staged tourist attraction. But you are definitely made to feel the reality of the place whilst you are captivated and hang on to each of the words coming out of the ex-prisoner, tour guides mouth.So overall a \"must do\" when visiting Capetown - best to book online at least the day before to avoid disappointment as its always fully booked!!"

Robben Island is one of those places you feel you simply MUST visit if you have a sense of history - rather like Auschwitz - you go there because you should not because you want to. So having a bit of a \"comic\" on the initial bus tour was not appropriate in my view. So briefly I will say that the 45 minute or so boat ride across to the island can be very choppy so take something if you are apt to puke on a boat. Secondly, everyone is herded onto a bus and you are taken around the island and while it is interesting to see the tortoises and penguins, what we are here for us to visit the prison and in my view rather too much bus and not enough prison. At the prison the talk given by one of the ex prisoners was absolutely fascinating - he was sentence to 25 years at the age of 21.....fortunately with the change of politics he was released after 8 years but during this time he had to sleep on a simple blanket on the floor in a room of 60 men. We were then taken to Block B, Cell 7 which was Nelson Mandela's cell for every day of the 18 years that he spent there. It was very moving to see this place which could have driven him mad but, instead, helped in focus on what he had to do when he was eventually released.So in brief, a must see but we prefer less time on the bus and more time in the prison !"

The ferry trip is stunning although apparently it can get a little rough sometimes and you get fantastic views of Table Mountain. Robben Island itself has a really interesting history and this gets brought to life by a guided bus trip and later a tour of a cell by a past inmate. This adds a personal touch to the facts and brings history alive. The one thing you leave with is a sense of hope that we will learn from our mistakes and learn to treat each other with consideration and care."

The biggest surprise was that our tour of the jail area was done with a former prisoner of the Island. He was quite open to questions, which made the tour very personal. There was also a bus tour of the Island, which takes you to areas of the prisoners lives, which were explained to us. Along the way we stopped for a short comfort break, and were lucky enough to see Whales. The boat trip out to the Island - around 45m - was calm, the return was quite choppy. However, the view of Table Mountain slowly coming closer definitely took your mind off any lumps and bumps. This trip gets Very Busy. Luckily I decided to go to the Ferry Terminal the day I arrived, as I had to wait two days for a ticket. Either do that, and re-jig you agenda or, pre-book before travel.

It did! We were advised by the very friendly shop attendant that we would have to wait for the next boat (3 hours time) but feel free to roam the prison. Upon returning to the prison being a smaller group the prison became much more \"real\" and less a tourist attraction. The silence and empty hall gave an altogether different experience to what it was earlier in the day.

The guy we had to take us around the inside of the prison was difficult to understand, he was informative to a degree but relied/encouraged people to keep asking him questions. He kept saying 'come on quick, quick time is money' and shuttled us through. Again, when we got in the corridor to see Nelson Mandela's cell it was packed, to be honest it could have been anyone's cell, nothing there that made it unique, that I saw anyway. Then I noticed people were going into other cells so I followed suit, to my surprise there was a photo on the wall and a narrative from the person incarcerated there, I found this very interesting and moving but of course we were shuttled onwards. That is what I found disappointing, if you could take your time, like in a museum, to digest what you are reading and what that person was going through at the time it would make the experience so much better.If you have seen inside a prison before, you are not missing much other than to say you have been to Robben island, and get the history from wikipedia.

You can \u201cfeel\u201d the past inmates in the atmosphere. Make sure you book tickets in advance. Best bet \u2013 take the first boat over. The actual visit is a bit disappointing. The tours are led by ex-inmates which is interesting. However, they are sometimes difficult to understand. You are transported around the island with a couple of stops via large buses. At some points, the stop is very brief and you cannot exit the bus. At others, you can exit for a tour of the cells and washrooms, but a very disjointed tour. The bus groups are too large for a single speaker to be heard. Upon arrival at stops the group should be divided into smaller groups. Need to provide more time for visitors to read the signs along the way to really capture the history and importance of this site. When visitors are returned to the harbor, there is not enough time to visit the gift shop unless you want to wait an additional hour or two for the next boat. Sorry\u2026 no gift shop experience is worth waiting that long for another boat. Recommendations: Reserve a minimum of 4 hours for this visit. Take Dramamine if you experience motion sickness as the boat crossing can be quite rough. We have rough waters and many of the passengers were green or getting ill! Wear good walking shoes. Be patient with photo opportunities. You may need to wait in line to catch a photo of Nelson Mandela\u2019s cell and other key points, but it\u2019s worth it. Recommended improvements to the staff: Give each visitor a card with an actual inmate\u2019s name and history. Then, at the end of the tour, visitors can check the board to see if they were released, relocated, died in prison, or whatever. Provide visitors with a bit more independence to walk in other areas. Maybe provide guided audio tours for an extra fee. Visitors can then pace their visits and the audio will be more easily understood than a single guide with a bus load of people."

I leant towards rating this 'poor', but went for average as I think it is an extremely important attraction, and it is a fantastic thing that it is open to the public. However I don't believe the visitor experience does it justice.Unlike others we had a fairly easy time booking tickets (I think you just have to plan ahead) and the boat ride went smoothly. However once you get there, there is a not-particularly-clear loudspeaker announcement telling you to get onto some buses over in the car park. You are then driven around the island with a guide giving you info and you are able to stop for a few minutes only at a couple of locations. The guide for this section of our trip was great and really informative, although it would be nice to have seen more things in person rather than from the bus window!You are then dropped off at the political prisoner compound where you are passed onto a guide who was an ex-inmate. This was, really regrettably, not good- the pace of the tour was very erratic, at times it was very difficult/impossible to understand what the guide was saying and at other times he would repeat the same thing over and over, meaning there wasn't much content. I wouldn't know what to suggest in improvement as it is a really good unique selling point and a really valuable thing to have prior inmates who are able to testify, but I don't think it has the impact that it should. I'd also imagine the experience varies depending on who you are shown round by. It was also very crowded here with large amounts of time being taken up for people to individually get pictures of Nelson Mandela's cell, and I got the impression that there were several areas we didn't even get to see.By the time this is done, you have maybe 10 mins at the harbour and shop and then you get back on the boat.Practicalities- set aside 4 hours. Wouldn't recommend going in flip flops as I did as the terrain is a bit rough in places. It's good to bring a camera although getting good pictures will require patience as there are so many people!Really this tour would benefit from giving visitors more independence and being more information-heavy. It was difficult not to mentally compare the experience to Alcatraz where you walk around with a guided audio tour and there is a huge amount available to learn. Perhaps with the size of the island this wouldn't be possible but allowing visitors more flexibility and autonomy I think would improve it greatly.I wouldn't say that I don't recommend it at all, as it is a great thing to see, but the visitor experience pales in comparison to other museums both in Cape Town and elsewhere, and is in need of some TLC!"

We called the Robben Island Museum on 5 occasions as it looked like we were destined to be late, however nobody picked up the phone. When we arrived, we explained we had tried to call and asked if we could swap to a different trip as we had already paid. We were told we would have to get, in writing, a letter from MyCiti conforming the bus problem. I see where they are coming from, however asking this of a tourist with less than 48hrs left of their trip is something of a big ask. I implored them to call the bus company and check if they wanted, and also showed the the call log on my phone showing I had called and nobody answered. I ended up filling in a form and having to buy new tickets. I would hope one day that perhaps if this is read, they can look to issue a refund for my original tickets. The person at the \"Information Desk\" didn't seem to have any sympathy, nor really care about anything.On the Island itself, the tour was great on the bus. The guide was both funny and knowledgeable, and made sure everyone felt part of the experience.The tour of the prison with a former political prisoner was great too, however our guide was quite softly spoken so hard to hear at times.Needless to say, after what was a great trip, our ferry going out to the island was delayed by 15 minutes, and our return trip home delayed by almost an hour.

Our tour guide on the bus ride around the island was a real highlight as he was able to give us first hand accounts of the struggle in a humorous and charismatic way. The tour of the prison itself, conducted by a former inmate as fantastic and hearing him talk about his experiences there and life afterwards was truly inspiring."

            "review": "Unmissable!. The island is about 4kms out and the journey takes about 40 minutes from the waterfront. It's a very popular attraction, which gets booked up 24 hours or more in advance ( although you might be lucky enough to get tickets on the day) so best to buy timed tickets online (R300 in October 2015). The trip is also weather dependent (full refund if cancelled) so try to leave another day spare to do it if cancelled. Make sure you arrive in good time as the queue to board starts early.On arrival you are met by a tour bus, with guide - if you are really lucky you will get Yasir Mohammed (not sure about spelling) who has the great gift of communicating facts in the most fascinating way ensuring a rapt bus load of visitors all listening intently.The island itself has an other worldly feel, and you can well imagine how bleak and silent it was during its days as a prison. The. It's most famous residents were Nelson Mandela who spent 18 years of 25 confinement here, and Robert Sobukwe who was held in solitary confinement for 9."

I was very lucky to be able to purchase a ticket at the V & A Waterfront a couple hours before the 1 pm ferry took off. You will have ample opportunity to take pictures of the mainland and Table Mountain from the ferry. Sometimes you would even see seals, dolphins and whales swimming by. The prison itself is not much different from any other prison. Depending on which guides you got, the script would be very moving. I liked the island bus tour much better than the prison tour because the island does have a number of interesting landmarks and a long history other than being the prison for important political prisoners. We also saw a group of African penguins near the island shop."

You may need to book your trip on the ferry a few days in advance however, so perhaps do it online. Sometimes if the sea is too rough the ferries will be cancelled.It's definitely worth visiting to see what life was like at the prison. You will begin your trip being driven around to other parts of the island and will stop at a cafe where you can get really nice photos across the sea to Table Mountain. Sometimes there are birds nesting and penguins in the area too.Next you visit the lime mine where the prisoners worked, then you go to the prison and are guided around by a former prisoner. You see one of the cell blocks where they had lots of prisoners in one room first and hear about what life was like, then you walk through a couple of courtyards and go to the single occupancy cells, and see where Nelson Mandella was held.There's not much chance to walk around independently and see anything yourself, unless you want to miss your return ferry and chance the next one. But on the guided tour you will see everything you really want to see, so it's nothing bad to just follow the crowd."

I was touched that after all he went through he seemed to be extremely forgiving.The reason for my rating is what happened on the way back. Although it was still sunny, it turned out that the winds had picked up quite a bit (after I got back I checked and the weather report which said 30mph). We were put on a tiny flat bottomed boat called Thandi. The ride was extremely unpleasant. The waves were around 3/4m high, which is almost the size of the boat. It did not seem like suitable sailing conditions for this boat which looked as if it was going to capsize. The captain had to repeatedly turn the engine off because of the incoming big waves and I was left fearing my life for about an hour. The worst part is that this was completely unnecessary; they have bigger ships that can easily travel under these conditions but for some reason they decided to endanger our lives by putting us on the small boat."

On arrival then you are put in a bus and taken around the island with a knowledgeable and entertaining guide. Only stop off is for pictures of table mountain until you get to the actual prison. Any other pics need to be taken from the bus so was disappointed we weren't able to get off and have a look around or take photos. On arrival at the prison a former inmate takes you around and tells his story and a bit about the prison history. The guides were the most interesting part and you don't get long to wander and take snaps before you are rushed back to the ferry so the next boatload can come in and do the same. Nowhere for a drink or snack really either so if you are on the 11am trip back at 2.30 you should eat prior. Very efficient and directed process but felt like it was get you on, get a look, get you off and not great for wandering or pics. We were lucky with the weather too - day before visits got cancelled due to swell and strong winds. Book well prior as it gets full up and we would have missed out otherwise if doing when there."

On the way out again you are rushed by loudspeakers into the boat, even if you are the first visitor to be out you have no time to walk and look at the boards which are an exhibition, or go into their souvenir shop or even use the bathrooms.I am happy I went but I was left with some bitter feelings."

Leave yourself plenty of time to find the ferry ticket office. Fortunately for us a nice local woman was able to direct us efficiently and safely through a construction site to get to the ticket office; maybe we had tried to enter from the wrong entrance. Fortunately, the sea was calm and the weather sunny, and the trip to the Island great with magnificent views of Table Mountain and Cape Town city. On Robben Island we had a great tour guide (Tabhu) and driver (Albert I think). It is quite chilling entering the jail complex and looking up at the foreboding \u2018WE SERVE WITH PRIDE\u2019 sign. Tabhu was knowledgeable and friendly and he adapted the tour to maximise our enjoyment (at one point, he bypassed one site as there was a busload of people there and instead took us to another site, which was less busy, then returning to the first after the other bus had moved on). Inside the prison we were able to listen to one of the original political ex-prisoners (Glen) who spoke in a very moving way about his time on Robben Island. We saw Nelson Mandela\u2019s cell, which was quite an emotional experience for both myself and my wife. Those were terrible times indeed back then during the Apartheid period. I am glad South Africa has moved forward. For anyone who has read \u2018Long Walk to Freedom\u2019, this tour of Robben Island makes a very fitting epilogue."

Pack plenty of water especially if it is a hot day and there isn't much opportunity over the 3.5 hours to go to the bathroom so take the opportunity when you can. From talking to friends who did the tour but at different times, the quality of the tour is dependent on the tour guide allocated to your group. Ours was good but could have gone more in depth for the non South African tourists in our group. Some of the signs on the island are very worn and tired and these could be revamped to provide more information on the history as well. The bus allocations where disorganised and there was a a lot of unnecessary stopping and starting along the tour. I still really enjoyed the history and it is something you must do when travelling to Cape Town but the whole operation could be a lot more organised and professional."

As we were visiting out of season we were able to get tickets easily without having to queue. The journey over to the island takes about 40 minutes but is very enjoyable as you get to view Cape Town and Table Mountain from a distance. Once we arrived at the Island we got onto a bus which then gave us a short guided tour around the Island. The guide on our bus was very knowledgable and humourous and pointed out the various points of interest like the leper graveyard and the place where the prisoners were forced to work every day. The views are stunning but you get a feeling of how depressing it must have been to see the South African mainland in the distance and to know you might never step foot on it again. After the bus completed it's short tour we met our prison guide, a former prisoner, who took us around the prison over the next 90 minutes or so. The tour was very interesting, to hear the stories from someone who actually lived through it was very powerful. You have to remember that many of the men who were sent to Robben Island were political prisoners who were arrested for having an opinion - our guide was only a student when he was arrested for holding a meeting at his college - yet they were treated worse than many of the 'proper' criminals. On the tour we got to see the cell that Nelson Mandela spent 18 of his 27 years in prison. So many men lost the best years of their lives here, the least we can do is remember what they went through. If you are in Cape Town I highly recommend going on this tour, it really makes you think."

He had a strong accent, which was difficult to understand for us - that cannot be helped but if we had been fewer people it would not have been such a problem. All in all, a must-do, but there is a lot of room for improvement."

The crossing was scheduled for 30 minutes but took nearer to 50 as the sea was fairly rough partway across. We did see a whale on the way though!Once on the island we were divided up, some people walking to the prison first while our group did the bus tour first. You will get to do both. The bus tour took us past Robert Subokwe's house, the leper cemetery and the hospital, all the while with a commentary from a guide. He, like the the other guides, were all original prisoners from the prison. The only problem was that the microphone was not very loud so it was hard to hear him while the bus engine was running.After the bus tour we were dropped at the prison building and given a walking tour of the cells and dormitories, including of course Nelson Mandela's cell. Many of the cells contain details of their occupant, sometimes with the option to hear their voices or see some of their letters or belongings. Our guide for this section was a gentleman called Nindisi Siswana (apologies for the spelling if wrong), who was excellent, really bringing it to life with exactly the right mix of pathos and uplifting endeavour."

Busses were cramped and dirty, microphones failed, you were unable to see clearly from the bus and there was no invitation to explore the island after the formal tour was completed. To me this should be a full day trip, with time to explore the full history that this island has to offer, not only as a prison for political dissidents, but its former history as a leper colony and assylum. This place has the potential to be a high impact, emotionally charged attraction but for me it fell way short of this."

When we reached the Victoria and Alfred Waterfront, one afternoon in April, we walked up to the place where ferries take off to Robben Island. To our greatest disappoint, we found that all the tickets are sold out for that day, and we had to come next morning. So make it a point to book your tickets early to suit your itinerary. We bought out tickets for next morning trip and arrived for the 830 am trip. We made the trip, and we didn\u2019t mind all this hassle because it was fully worth it, for two reasons. Firstly it was a long awaited moment in my life to be where this great man was incarcerated for 18 long years, and secondly, the amazingly beautiful scene of Cape town, flanked by her famous mountains slowly appearing and taking their full shape and dimensions when you approach land in your return trip was truly a sight to behold. Robben Island is both a South African National Heritage Site as well as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.The comfortable and covered ferry took about an hour to reach the island. From there, there were comfortable busses to take you to the prison. There was an English speaking guide, who was very witty, like most of the SA guides I have met, gave us a commentary briefing us about the history of the islands and s description of the important buildings and sights. We stopped by to have a cup of coffee and then went to see the prison complex where Mr. Mandela was held. The description of the prison life was given by one of former inmates. Unfortunately this gentleman who gave us the commentary had a very hoarse voice and spoke in a low volume and spoke with a heavy accent and I couldn\u2019t follow anything he said. To date, three of the former inmates of Robben Island have gone on to become President of South Africa: Nelson Mandela, Kgalema Motlanthe, and current President Jacob Zuma.After photographs we were taken to see where Mandela was incarcerated. We were not so lucky to see penguins that day.The return trip was in an ancient ferry , Dias, and we were able to travel on the deck. We were fascinated by the sight of approaching Cape, in its all glory. The Devil\u2019s Peak, Table Mountain, Signal Hill, Twelve Apostles, all these peaks were visible from sea and looked so beautiful.We arrived at the Jetty in time to see huge seals.It was certainly worth of every Rand we spent\u2026"

There weren\u2019t enough buses available to cater for the numbers so we were some of the people who waited over 40 minutes of the 2 hours we were on the island for a bus to appear and the tour had to be foreshortened in order to get us back to the wharf to board the boat on time.

I emailed immediately asking them to fix this (it was the middle of the night so I couldn't phone), but they didn't reply. I phoned first thing the next morning and was passed from person to person. Ultimately a supervisor phoned me back, said it was my fault (she didn't believe me when I explained I had selected the correct time/date), and wouldn't swap the date even though tickets were available at the time I'd tried to book. She said I'd have to buy another ticket, which seemed to be a blatant attempt to milk tourists of their money. So it was 300 Rand (around US$25) down the drain! I don't really know what happened, but I am certain i chose the correct time/date and I suspect the computer 'timed out' while my overseas credit card verification was happening, thus issuing a different ticket to what I could see on the screen. In any event, the staff were unnecessarily unhelpful, and insisted that I'd left it too late to do anything about it because it was within 48 hours of the issued date (their T&C say tickets can be changed up to 48 hrs beforehand for an admin fee, but they wouldn't change it even though I offered to pay the admin fee) -- notwithstanding that this was because the ticket that issued was for that day rather than the day I wanted!! Needless to say, I was not impressed. The staff at the Radisson Blu Hotel (where I was attending a conference) tried to assist but were also startled by how unhelpful the Robben Island people were -- a strange way to run a tourist attraction that presumably the New South Africa wants people to see so they can understand the brutality of the past.

Its a eerie thought provoking experience being in the place where Mandela and other political prisoners spent so many years in prison. It was really the birth place of our democratic and free country and were probably much of our current constitution was probably drafted.Its a beautiful boat trip across and we were lucky enough to see whales on the way there and back.Tips1. Its a long trip a good 5 hours and no much options or time to grab a snack so I'm glad we had lunch before we went.2. Not great on a windy rainy day as its a long trip over3. Book in advance - at least the morning of your trip as it gets very busy"

I had heard many negative reviews about the Robben Island excursion, and the whole experience was extremely disappointing. I had many opportunities to make this trip over the last years, and kept putting it off, until I finally decided to take this trip. Sadly, I will NEVER do it again, and will NEVER recommend it to anyone else either. From the arrival and boarding like a bunch of cattle to a broken-down ferry ... it's a very very disappointing and badly run excursion. Extremely sad, since it can be so much more impressive and memorable."

The idea of visiting the prison, where so many political prisoners fought for their freedom should be a moving and memorable experience. Unfortunately, my trip was tainted by two things - a very rough boat trip and an incomprehensible guide. After 35 minutes of rough seas (they cancelled all the rest of the trips that day) we proceeded to visit the prison - our guide a former inmate. He seemed to be a well meaning and lovely man, but his English was incomprehensible. I appreciated the fact that he wanted to give us a tour, but it doesn't help if no one could understand him. The bus trip part was great, but too short, since it was the only part we could get information. I also would have preferred being able to walk around the island.

While it was incredible to see the cell where Nelson Mandela was held for so many years, we felt that the tour was not terribly well run. An ex-prisoner was the guide while going through the jail, which should have been very enlightening (and it was at times), but we had a hard time hearing him due to it being a large group, and he was often very difficult to understand, so a lot of what he said was lost. You spend part of the tour in the jail, and then part on a bus going around the island. The island itself has great views of Cape Town and Table Mountain (and you may spot some penguins). Definitely book the trip in advance as it tends to sell out. You take the ferry from the V&A waterfront to the island (about 15 minutes on the ferry). Overall, I definitely think this is something that should be done on a visit to Cape Town, but I felt the tour of the jail was a little lacking which was disappointing."

Sadly, we did not get any sense of what Mandela (& all the others) lived thru - just a feeling that we would have been better off doing something else."

A visit to Robben Island helps give a wider perspective to Cape Town including its past as a Dutch resupply location, leper colony and graveyard, military outpost during WW 11, and of course location of the infamous prison used for political prisoners during Apartheid--including Nelson Mandela. The Ferry trip out and back along, if a sunny day, is probably worth the price, however if you treasure history, a visit is mandatory."

The trrip to Robben Island is a horrble tourist trap and was definately the worst of the Cape Twon expriences (which otherwise were all great).If you are interested on the history of this place, buy the book for 125 Rand and or visit the exhibition at Jetty 1 down at the Waterfront.That is unless you want to be treated like a prisoner yourself, than this is probably a great experience.We were put onto a boat, which in very little waves produced the most severe movements and took more than 50 minutes to get to the 7.5 km away island (the return journey miravulously only took 25 minutes).Upon arrival we were instructed via a loudspeaker system to get into a very uncomfortable bus (5 seats per row), severe safety hazards (worn-down tyres and wrongly assembled wheesl) and a guide, who must have been the most arrogant South African I came across. We were then taken on a bus tour of the islamd, with completely unrelated commentary and a compulsary stop and an uninteresting place, where there apparently usually is a voew of the mainland (it was very foggy, so no view). And although the attraction of the view was obviously lacking everybody had to get of the bus, stand there for 12 minutes solud and then got back on the bus.When we finally arrived at the prison we werw taken on a tour of the building, which was quite interesting, as ir was led by an ex-inmate, but seemed limited in svope.After this we were told to go back down to the harbour, were we were told we HAD to get on the boat, as there would be no other. Apparently no time to visit the toilet. When we visited the toilet anyway, another boat was available after all.Everything seemed to be tailored to limit time for people on the island and especially prevent individual exploriation.I assume, they would have loged, if we just paid our entrance fee and then not go at all.If you do go to the island, don't get on a bus and be initimadated by their strange instructions, after all we are visitors and not inmates.It seeemedthere is lotsto explore on the island, if you get the opportunity."

The bus stopped about half way round at a little cafe which sold snacks and drinks, this appears to be the only place to eat on the trip apart from the boat which only sold drinks and crisps. Many people had brought there own food. Our guide was very good and clearly experienced. The highlight of the tour was the walking part, led by an ex-inmate.

It was a gorgeous sunny day which made the 45 minute ferry ride to Robben Island bearable. The process to get tickets was messy as the online website was not working for us and our concierge tried to call for tickets but no one was picking up. Fortunately, we were able to get tickets for the same day. We spent about 1/2 hour before the ferry ride exploring the museum which had some interesting displays but probably could be more robust. The ferry ride offers a beautiful view of the ocean and city behind you. However, it can be a bumpy ride- so fair warning for those who get motion sickness. Once you get off the ferry, you're shuttled onto buses and driven around the island. This is the part of the tour that, while informative, could have been shortened a bit but there are some interesting landmarks besides the prison. Then you're let off at the prison and met by a former prisoner who guides you on a tour of the various blocks. Our guide was very open and honest about his stay there and shared a lot of information with us. Overall, I'm glad we went but I think the whole process could be a little more organized and cohesive."

A pleasant boat ride will take you to the prison used for many years during apartheid and before as a place for lepers, prisoners and other undesirables. A driving tour of the island is followed by a walk through the prison itself. The prison tour is conducted by prior detainees. Some of these guides are more articulate than others but all seem to bring alive the time of the struggle for equal rights. Every South African school should have this as a curriculum requirement."

I was advised to book the tour before even going to Cape Town and did so online several weeks in advance. Another tip I would offer is to sit inside. I was tempted by the thought of sitting outside at the front and arrived at the Island pretty wet as the boat bounced over the waves. The tour is very well organised with a bus trip round the island, including a couple of stops, one of which offers beautiful views over the sea to Cape Town and Table Mountain, before arriving at the prison. The prison, and of course Nelson Mandela's cell, is the highlight of the tour and the guide and later one of the former political prisoners previously held there gave very descriptive accounts. There is not really a great amount to see on the island, or even in the prison itself, but I found the whole tour a very moving experience. I did brave the outside front of the boat again on the return journey and was rewarded with some great views as we headed back to Cape Town, as well as another soaking."

(About $30 Australian) this was for 4 hours including the tour and half hr ferry there and back. The tour consisted of travelling around the whole island via bus with travel guide commentating. We had a young Indian guy. He was so knowledgeable great to listen too. The bus tour went for about 40 mins with a toilet stop at the little cafe with snacks and drinks available. It's went to the lime quary the village for workers ect. Then the tour of the jail itself was about about an 40 mins and very informative. Our guide was actually imprisoned when Mandela was still there I believe. He showed us threw the courtyard, cells, Mandelas cell and his private garden he made in the courtyard. Threw most parts. Explained the menus as it was diffrent from the whites to what the blacks were entitle too and lots of other information. The guide then explained his experience and life story and how he ended up in jail. It's crazy that he chose to stay on the island you would think he would've ran for his life from the island when it was closed. But it certainly makes the tour so much more by having him there as a guide. Don't miss this it's a history lesson with depth! Nelson you sure are one amazing human. Worth every cent.

            "review": "Shameful History, Shamefully Presented. Organised by our travel agent for us on our second day in Cape Town, we had high expectations given our experience on the first day with our private tour, but this was a reminder of how many things can be screwed up when presenting an iconic part of South Africa's recent history. Our tickets had been prepaid, so we headed straight for the scanners: we waited a few minutes before being allowed to pass through the scanners and board the boat. The queuing area looked like it could hold about 30-40 people at a time, and was quite modern. More on this later ...After boarding and heading upstairs on the boat, we took our seats: as we were doing so, the safety officer kept calling for volunteers to fill up the VIP section, which was a glassed area on the second floor. Why anyone would pay extra to sit there, we couldn't work out as the door was left open (upstairs is very noisy) and most of the VIP folks left anyway once we got underway. The safety officer welcomed us with what should have been a humorous talk, but the delivery was wooden and no one laughed. It appears that someone has scripted these presentations but not explained the technique of delivery. Arriving at the island, we were directed by loudspeaker to board buses at the end of the pier. These were decrepit looking vehicles with 5-wide seating (anyone in the isles was bumped by other guests) and dirty windows ... so no point trying to take photos. The \"45\" minute bus tour was really a 10-minute affair, with 15-20 mins spent the first stop so that our bus driver could cuddle with her partner while guests mingled, took photos of Cape Town and purchased snacks at a run down cafe. There was a presenter in the bus, but like the safety officer on the boat, the delivery of the information on Robben Island was limited to whatever the speech writer had written, and was given in a monotone (including the \"jokes\"). There is such a rich history to be told that it cries out for someone to make it interesting and engaging.After the first stop, the bus moved onto a quarry, with a stop of 5-10mins (no boyfriend to cuddle there) and then onto the prison where one of the political prisoners walked us through. While he was friendly, he was very hard to understand - I got about half of what we was saying. He harangued us for about 5 minutes at the entrance quoting Nelson Mandela's prisoner number until everyone in the group could repeat it before we set off: it was needlessly pedantic, and upset a few people who were embarrassed that it took 4 or 5 attempts for them to remember it. The tour ran late, and everyone headed back quickly to the wharf to catch the return boat. We need not have bothered: there had been a breakdown and it was chaos with several boatloads of people trying to board a single craft. There were no announcements as people ignored a lame attempt to ask everyone to queue up. We stayed downstairs for the return trip as it is quieter and more comfortable. When we got back to the mainland, there was an enormous queue stretching for about 100meters beyond the threshold of the building used by board the boats. Really, this should be better managed, coordinated and presented - I'd love to return and see it improved but if it is just more of the same, I'd save my time and read Wikipedia instead as I learned almost nothing from the experience."

I had high hopes for Robben Island because I love history so much but I was quite disappointed with the overall experience of this tour. My biggest complaint is that you get on old, crowded buses and driven around the prison grounds. They stop at historical sites, such as the quarry where Mandela and other inmates secretly taught each other different things and ideas, but you can't get out of the bus. I was on the wrong side of the bus and could barely see through other people's heads. There were a few other sites that were obstructed by small bus windows and people! The 2nd complaint is that the tour guide, although he was an actual inmate, was not a proper tour guide. He had no stories and was boring actually. It was super disorganised and my group of 40 were pushed through small doors and corridors and I had no idea where to go. I also left the island feeling like I had no idea about Mandela. I would have given it a 1 star but the view of Cape Town from the boat ride is fantastic. I would recommend going to a museum over going to Robben Island."

A great pity then that this trip seems to have devolved into a bit of a bored shuffle through South Africa's recent history.  Bored bus drivers and equally bored guides pack visitors onto buses and whisk them around the Robben island history racetrack. The climax (after a littany of barely comprehsnsible 'struggle' names have been fired at you like a gatling gun) is to be crammed into the main prison complex with a 'former political prisoner' as a guide and historical spokesperson. Perhaps its time for some investment in a public address system in order for more than a handful of the visitors to listen to the dialogue. Quite probably the talk was interesting but judging from the looks, I'd guess not. The brief 10 minute coffee/ablution stop seemed to be the most popular part of the trip judging from the conversations, and despite the island also being a reserve, we were whisked away from wildlife sighting with a, 'they're just birds, who wants to see them'? Avoid - its more exciting (and cheaper) to go and buy the book, The Long Walk to Freedom, and then go for an ice cream."

My family and I were very humbled to have visited Robben Island but it isn't a trip I would make again nor would have attended had I known what to expect. In summary, even in SA's winter/ low season; long queues, gosling tourists all vying for the best position to take pictures, cramped tour buses with glass windows preventing photography, a prison tour guide that was difficult to understand (accepting he was an ex-inmate and we were therefore gracious of his involvement) - basically, an over-subscribed stereotypical tourist attraction full of rude and bad mannered people. A little harsh but not my `cup of tea'. The only constructive comment I can make is a recommendation from a Cape Town tour guide who advised us to sit on the right hand side of the tour bus when leaving the ferry/ boat given the tour bus circles the island clockwise and most of the sites are on the RHS of the bus. Lighting in the prison is difficult for cameras as our flash bounces off the walls and creates excessive brightness whilst no flash leaves photos too dark - if you want to take good photos think careful about your approach (hence why some many people hung back to take photos and became a bit of a nuisance). I have scored this review 3 stars simply because of the nature of the tour, i.e. desire to want to see where Nelson Mandela was incarcerated. My personal recommendation would be to book the trip online before you visit SA but have it has an `optional cancellation' should you not be able to undertake another trip and need to re-schedule your itinerary. FYI, the trip is also subject to weather with the scheduled trip the day after we attended being cancelled yet the swell on the sea did not appear excessive so if you really want to visit Robben Island as `a must' ensure you leave contingency in your plan to re-schedule."

Coming from Western Australia the parallels with Rottnest island are obvious: both \"discovered\" by the Dutch, both named after animals (penguin and quokka); both home to the brutal incarceration of Indigenous peoples. Robben island though has a much more significant impact on the history of its mainland. You get there by boat from the V&A waterfront. Finding the right dock is confusing as there is a Robben island museum and Nelson Mandela Gateway to Robben island. It's the latter dock near the clock tower centre where you embark (33\u00b054'22.6\"S 18\u00b025'21.2\"E). Buy your tickets online a few days before departure as the tours can get fully booked. The trip takes about 45 minutes with possible whale sightings along the way. On reaching the island you take a 45 min bus tour and 60 min guided tour of jail. Both have informative and passionate guides to take you through the history. Our jail guide spent 6 years incarcerated for so called terrorist activities. It would be good if the SA tourist authorities would allow some eco friendly accommodation on the island to allow for those interested to stay longer to investigate this living history."

My mum was fascinated by President Mandela so I had grown up knowing he was important. When we arrived after getting the ferry I instantly felt uneasy. The place is grim. As we were shown around the max security by an ex prisoner I just got more uneasy. I cannot believe that this happened. I cannot believe people were treated like this. The things they tell you that went one and the things that you see there are just awful. It is so important that you go there to see it with your own eyes. People were taking selfies and it was inappropriate. Although it is now open as a message of freedom and forgiveness I just feel so embarrassed that us Whites treated the black community like that. It was an incredible experience and I don't want to go into too much detail as I want everyone to hear about it whilst they are there. The ferry is a forty minute journey and it's an enjoyable ride, we even saw a whale on the way. The have refreshments and toilets on board. There are toilets and a little cafe on the island and a little shop where you can buy books about the apartheid and the prisoners etc. make this number one on your Cape Town list."

He showed us the room where he himself had been incarcerated and talked about the prisoners' daily routines, limited food rations, etc. Another guide took us around the island by bus before dropping us off at the pier for the ride back to Cape Town. South African politics have changed a lot since the days when Robben Island was used as a prison, and visiting here helped me understand the attitudes that prevailed in the not-so-distant past.

(No one tells you before you depart the ferry that half of you will go first on a bus tour and half will go first on a walking tour; you learn this only after the buses leave you behind and you blindly follow others on the short walk to the prison). Nevertheless, I still found the visit worthwhile. I know a great deal about South African history, but I learned a great deal more from this visit. The guide through the prison is a former inmate. Though his voice was low and often monotone, his personal anecdotes added texture and richness to the experience. The guide for the bus tour was younger and more energetic. In short, Robben Island is a must-see for those--like me--who see Nelson Mandela as an extraordinary man, an international hero. Budget 3-4+ hours, including travel time because it is impossible to know just how long the tours (walking and on bus) will be, and you do not how quickly a ferry will depart once you have finished the tour."

If you are in Cape Town for more than a day or two I would strongly suggest paying a visit to Robben Island, but you should budget most of the day to do this. My tour departed at 11:00 am and I did not return to port until close to 3:30 as they were in no real hurry to depart the island at the appointed 2:00 time. South African time is always on time.Go with an open mind, I have read some reviews of people who have not liked the visit but I think it is good to just take it as it comes. The visit was broken into two parts, first a bus tour of the island and various points. We could get out of the bus for some of it but not others. That part was not as good and I would have liked to be able to get out of the bus more at some of the points. The second half is the actual prison tour. Most or all of the time the tour is lead by former prisoners who actually live on the island to this day. I found it very informative on what life was like for prisoners during South Africa's Apartide past. They show you the cells, our guide talked about what life was like and they take you to the B Group area where Mandela was housed. You will see the courtyard where he spent time and get a chance to see his cell.The ride out takes 35-45 minutes by boat and it is open ocean so you will bounce some. If you get sea sick easily take some medication before going. Also they make a big deal about the boats departing on time, ours actually left 10 minutes early, so get there 30 minutes before you go. The return trip, they are not so worried about the boats leaving on a strict schedule so build in a buffer time on the back end.Wear comfortable shoes and once you get back walk around the V&A Waterfront. The island is exposed to the elements so pay attention to the weather before you go and bring something warm for the boat and island. Also book your ticket online, I only paid 300 Rand this way but had to pick my ticket up before boarding which took 15 minutes. Also pay close attention to the date on your ticket. I initially went a day early and on the right day for my ticket, there were other people who were there the wrong day. Also Americans so watch the date, especially if you are used to how Americans run the month first then the day."

Thoroughly recommend a visit it highlight the long walk to freedom and the hopes for the future."

The ferry trip was a rough 1hr 30mins (45 mins each way). I was fine for the first 15 mins but felt quite ill for the rest of the way. Therefore, I would suggest taking motion sickness medication if you suffer from this. On the plus side, the ferry ride is picturesque.Upon arrival to the island, we were ushered onto minibuses, where we were driven round the island. The tour guide was an ex-prisoner who was softly spoken and not entirely versed in English, so unfortunately, I did struggle to grasp the odd few sentences. The prison cells tour was also given by an ex-prisoner, it was informative but I felt that it lacked substance. We all know that Nelson Mandela was imprisoned for 18 of his 27 prison years on Robben Island, but I believe a bit of if recognition should be given to other key former prisoners such as;Autshumato - one of the first activists against colonialism Nceba Faku - former Metro Mayor of Port Elizabeth Jacob Zuma - current president of South Africa etc I wouldn't say the tour was a disappointment, but I believe the experience could have been better. Perhaps an auditorium with audio/visual narration as a part of the tour would be beneficial to visitors, smaller bookings at any one time and South African freedom singers at the dock to welcome visitors and set the tone."

The prison facilities although no longer in use are very well maintained. The tour through the prison itself was very eye opening. The fact that the guide through the prison was actually a past detainee gave very good insight into what happened there. The only issue, was that his accent was very heavy so you had to pay very close attention to what he was explaining but all in all it was a good tour."

Otherwise, it's get on the ferry, get on a bus to tour around the island (no walking permitted), a short tour through Mandela's prison block, back on the ferry. No chance to really experience what 17 years of 8 hours in the quarry (among other things) might be like. The museum at the ferry launch site is quite good, however -- spend some time there. Absolutely go -- but the touring part is such a skeleton of what it could be. Spend a few moments by the concession stand to get a sense of the island's isolation and inescapability."

Not a \"normal\" prison in that regular but a training ground (they called it the university) for black anti-apartheid activists. Not to be missed!

We walked five minutes from our V & A waterfront hotel to the Robben Island ferry building. We lined up about half an hour before our boarding time. I recommend you purchase your tickets online ahead of time and secure yourself a spot and the time you prefer. Once we boarded the ferry be sure to go to the upper deck and sit in the back row so that you can take some great photos of the waterfront, Table Mountain, Lion's Head, Signal Hill and the soccer stadium. The fellow on the ferry monitoring the top deck was a character with an good sense of humour. The 20 or so minute ferry ride was comfortable and was great for checking out the surrounding area. Once we arrived at Robben Island we boarded a bus and went on a tour of the island. The young fellow who led our bus tour had a dry sense of humour, was passionate about the info on the tour and encouraged questions and was overall fantastic. On the tour you do stop at a building with restrooms, food and refreshment snacks and it is a place to take photos of the mainland. The tour was informative and the perfect length of time. We then visited the prison that Mandela stayed in and that portion of the tour was led by a fellow prisoner of Mandela's. He too was amazing and shared his story. Even though there were a few tour members who were a little disrespectful he took charge and led the tour as a leader should (in stride). This tour ranks with some of the best I have been on in my world travels. After visiting the Apartheid Museum and Soweto in Johannesburg this completed the picture for me and gave me a better understanding about why Nelson Mandela has the respect that he has from South Africans and the world. South Africa well done on sharing Robben Island with us!"

I was equally interested to see the village and learn that the current staff (former prisoners and guards) still live there, side by side. The scenery of the island is stunning, and the view across the ocean back to the main land is beyond description. The tour of the maximum security unit is particularly poignant, and was conducted by a for.er prisoner who spoke with passion and conviction about his time as an inmate.

It was a very interesting tour for the most part, though it did feel a little bit rushed, and I do wish we could have had more time to explore on our own and learn a little bit more about the island and prison. It was very interesting hearing from a former prisoner, though the one we had seemed to be preaching a little bit, and giving a somewhat non-biased opinion of the island and prison. Overall, though, it's a must-see while you're in Cape Town,and a good way to spend a could of hours learning about a piece of history."

Robben Island is a historically significant place to visit because it is where Nelson Mandela was incarcerated for 18 years.We were able to book tickets for our group of 16, via our hotel's concierge, on the morning of the day that we went on the 1 pm tour. However we noted that the tour was sold out by the time that we got to the Waterfront, so it was just as well that we had gotten our concierge to book it online for us.When we arrived at Robben Island, it was initially unclear where we were supposed to go, particularly as we saw some groups getting onto buses while others walked towards the prison. After making enquiries, we were told that the first part of the tour consisted of a walk through the prison. It would be helpful if the people on the boat gave explicit instructions about the format of the tour (walk through prison then bus ride around the island) before disembarkation.Our guide, a former prisoner, was candid in his descriptions of prison life.Robben Island is well worth the visit."

We were looking forward to this tour so much, after watching the documentary and I even started reading the book before our vacation, we thought this was going to be such a great tour, we were so so dissapointed although the tour guides themselves have passion, the tour was ridicuously overcrowded and rushed1) we met at the designeted nelson mandela gates at the designated 12:30 time, there was over 4 boats and an estimated 500 people just for the 1 pm tour alone!!! each boat can hold 150 people and we saw 3 other boats leave before us, so we were thinking like wow this is gonna be a packed tour but hoped that they would subdevided us into groups when we got there alas not the case!!!2) our boat of 150 passengers arrived after an hour onto the island by which time both my partner and I were sea sick we thoght the ferry was 20 minutes not an hour and we should have taken our pills this was our fault, - we were ushered very quickly to board two busses, all 150 of us!!! on two busses, the other bus was not there so we waited for a good 15 minutes inside one bus while the other 70 or so people waited outside for their bus to arrive3) after everyone was on we had a supper supper 30 minute -40 rushed tour around the island, not a walkng tour, not a tour where you get to get off and get on, there were 2 stops we could get off one at the lime/cave place a total of 90 seconds!!!! so under a minute and a half was given to get off take 1 picture and run back to the bus that is it, and at the second stop which was last stop 10 minutes was given to go to bathroom and photograph water with view, the guide although enthouthiastic had no time to explain anything to us he just quickly pointed said ok this is a church, oh this was a school, i mean we were just astounded, i don't understand why they packed so many of us onto a bus and why it has to be so rushed, it was such an abysmal experience after such anticipation i felt like i was on train in china, we thought we were going to get on and off at serveral points during the tour, be able to take pictures alas we got but two pictures the whole 40 minute bus ride, the rest of the time the bus was moving and can;t take good pics through the windos of the glass, 4) we then arrived at the prison and we said ok finally we will get to walk around we got off and noticed the other 70 or so people on the other bus standing outside, we thought for sure there would be like two guides for both our groups but amazigly this was not the case!!! all about 150 of us were ushered into the tiny prison, by the time we reached one cell our guide had moved onto the next place inside the prison, so we missed almost every explanation ( only once did he wait for all the 150 people to be assembled) also while he was giving an explanation the tour from before us which was another 100 or so people was walking out so with them talking and their footsteps immposible to hear anything!!! 5) our guide although very enthouthiastic I could not understand anything when he was not facing us, this is not his fault ofcourse, but it was so frustrating to miss 75 percent of what he was saying, we were ushered into a room where the 40 prisoners slept, ( i will post pics of how crowded it was when we get back home you cans ee theres about 100 people sitting to my left in the picture) and another 50 on my right, the guide tried to walk around but because his accent was supper thick and there was so many people could not hear anything, when asked if he likes this job he said that this job is very depressing for him and he thought when he was released he would never have to come back here, so its hearbreaking to know he has to give tours there even though he really does not want tothen we were ushered back onto boat and another faster jetty ride back, what a horrific day for usI don't know what the tour company is thinking organizing tours so big 1 tour guide for 150 people or so is insane!!!! there should be a ratio of 1:20 maximum i think at the worst 1:40 not 1:150, they basically have 3 departure times and i am assuming its as crowded on other departures so 500 people visiting on each tour, i reccomend 1) making the tour longer, and allowing people to walk around the island and take pictures with a guide or on their own after the tour at least!!! how dissapointed it was to have only 2 pics after the whole tour of the island, and now overcrowding their ferries and bussed 2) have more guides or have option of audio guides,! it was so frustrating to come out of this tour not having learned anything because you could not hear the guide or could not understand him a lot of the time due to the chear number of group sizei have no idea if you can book a tour thats private or semi private where they don't pack people in so much, i would say do that otherwise give this attraction a miss,"

The bus tour was more interesting than the prison tour but rushed and hosted by an unenthusiastic guide. To improve this tour, I would suggest they look into doing something like Alcatraz in San Francisco whereby you are provided with an audio guide and you can walk yourself.

The \"Gateway to Robben Island\" operates two boats. One is very old and guides claim it is the boat that was used to ferry many of the political prisoners to the island. The other boat is quite a bit newer and is designed for sightseeing. Which boat you end up on is a function of where you are in line. On the day we sailed, they loaded the older boat first. Even on a clear, sunny day, the wind is stiff and chilly, so dress warmly. Problems began when we arrived on the island. Theoretically, we should have boarded a bus, but all of the buses were full. So about 50 people were assigned to walk to the prison with the one remaining guide. The walk was pleasant, but it was impossible to hear his comments because of the size of the group. And the large number of people slowed the whole process considerably. Everyone wanted a photo of Mandela's cell, but the corridor was narrow and it took forever. So parts of the tour were rushed. Our guide was a former political prisoner. His narrative was full of anecdotes and detailed information. So it was frustrating to be unable to see or hear him for parts of the tour. Also, the nature of what took place on the island, the reason for the tour, deserves more reflection and contemplation than this tour structure provides. We noticed very small groups working with their own guides. If we were to go again, we would pay more to book a private tour.Having said all of that, I am very glad I visited, and I learned a great deal about the history of political oppression and the struggle against that oppression."

The fact that you can visit a place with such amount of history its a privilege, specially since most of the tour guides were prisoners of the place himself. After a short ferry ride, out of the shore of Cape Town, you will have the chance of experiencing the old prison where Mandela spent a big part of his life. The tour is not easy to book and you will need at least one day in advance through the web page (recommend it) to book it. Same day bookings are almost impossible to find since most of the places run out quite fast. The tickets costs around 300 ZAR (around 25 USD) and in my opinion they are worth it. As I mentioned before, for me, the trip was a mixture of Goree Island with Alcatraz, having the chance of seeing such an important place in terms of history of the human rights battle and equality. You will be reminded about slavery, unfairness and hate, but the main message I took from here was peace."

The ferry ride to the island was smooth, although I understand that it can be quite choppy. There is a wonderful view of cable mountain from the back of the ferry. We saw a whale on the return trip.We were guided to buses once we got off the ferry. We driven around the island and were accompanied by a guide.p (I can't remember his name, other then that it means Joy) His knowledge was excellent and he was extremely personable. I felt that I learnt more from him than I would have learnt from an audio tour. He fully explained the history of the island and its uses over the centuries. He explained the story of Robert Sobukwe, which was so interesting I bought a book about him from the store. The actual tour around the prison was carried out by a former prisoner and again he was informative. He provided insight that is exclusive to former prisoners. I found the tour to be an emotional and humbling experience. Highly recommended!"

Then inhabitants of the island, getting into the same boat as tourists as part of their normal daily ferry routine, and jumping on and off before visitors. We had to wait for them????. The guide had No interest in the main attraction of Nelson Mandela cell. He explained in detail all other prisoners history, but made noreference to the one cell all came for. He was also visibly irritated with all questions being posed at him. Finally, when we got to the cell, not a single name plate that reference this to who the most famous prisoner was.

He was there for 7 years. He was an excellent guide who was quite funny and told us he, like the great Nelson Mandela, bore no ill feelings and had forgiven all the bad things that happened to him. The trip across the bay was about 40 minutes and was quite comfortable. You are able to order cold drinks or a beer etc on the way. On arrival at the island you are taken by bus around the island with commentary all the time.After that is the tour of the prison and, of course, where Mr Mandela spent all those years.

The tour pace easily allowed time for questions. The boat ride over was about 40 minutes in length. The ride back was much quicker as a different boat was used.

He was passionate about love thy neigbour, I actually thought I was being lectured too. We did see Mandela's cell, the courtyard, and the gravel pit. There was no organization in the tour groups to go one way, so you were constantly waiting for the tour group behind or in front of you to pass.

Very professionally run and with tour guides brought the place to life. Sadly, this is not what I observed upon my return visit in June 2015. Instead of the beautiful Robben Island catamaran, we were shepherded onto a very old tugboat and were subjected to 45 minutes of smoke blowing into our faces. Perhaps the other boat was under renovation but there was no explanation. There was also no explanation at any point of what to expect from the tour (ie bus ride, prison tour, boat ride back) nor was there any information provided on apartheid generally. For someone that didnt have a good background on South African history, the tour would not have been in context. When we got to the island, there was little direction as some folks in plain clothes told us to get on some old buses. What you couldn't tell was that these plain clothes people were in fact Robben Island staff and also our tour guides (PS - note to Robben Island management - please give your staff a standardized outfit saying Robben Island so people know who is in charge and also to just increase general professionalism). We then proceeded to drive around an area where Robert Sibukwe was kept and also the wardens' living quarters. Practically nothing that the tour guide said was comprehensible. People were asking each other \"Can you understand what she is saying?\" The answer was \"no\" or \"barely\" for everyone. Aside from her not speaking clear English, she was lethargic and uninspiring. We then went to the prison where we were greeted by a cheerful and extremely loud former inmate. This part of the tour was definitely much better. At the end of the tour, luckily my wife and I saw that a smaller more nimble boat was leaving so we caught that one back (saved 15 minutes and no smoke!) but the people just behind us were stuck waiting probably another 30 minutes for the tugboat to arrive and take them back. What is so disappointing is that Robben Island is such an important landmark in the history of South Africa and for many visitors this is the one history-related tour they will get. The tour used to be fantastic and frankly wouldn't take much to fix because the island and history speak for themselves. My opinion is that if there are financial shortfalls, they could increase the cost of the tour (for foreigners) to bridge the gap since overall it's not all that expensive.All in all, you probably still want to do the tour just to see Robben Island, just don't have too high expectations until management can address the current shortcomings."

You will get a first-hand look at the prison cells that housed political prisoners including Nelson Mandela and a tour lead by a former prisoner. To get to the island you have to take a ferry boat which takes about 1 hour. Depending on the season and weather (winter is worse) the water becomes so rough that boats often don't run past the morning. The ride can get quite rough, and though the boat is very safe, it is not for those who are easily sea sick or fearful of water travel. Once on the island, the tour is a combination of a bus ride and walking tour. For those interested in Apartheid history and the life of political prisoners, Robben Island is a must-see."

This is a beautiful place. You imagine yourself back in those years when prisoners were banished to this island and it makes your hair stand up. This is an experience in a life time. It is a must when visiting Cape Town however during the peak season which is December you have to prebook on line. During off peak season you can just go and buy a ticket and take a life time trip. It is amazing and it is also very sad to think what prisoner had to endure as well as our great icon Madiba. Love this place."

One must visit Robben Island for its historical value, but they herd you in so fast and you see so little, it is hard to reflect and have an emotional experience. For instance, the boat ride to the island was a wasted 30 minutes. We should have had headsets explaining what it was like for prisoners who were on the historical boats. What were conditions like? Maybe audiotape those still living describing the feelings and surroundings. Reinact others so that 30 minutes was like a seminar to prepare you for getting on the island. They have so many markers around the island, but they put you in groups and shoot you through a 15 minutes or so walking tour so fast, you don't get to let anything sink in or don't have time to read any of the posters and markers. Then the bus tour is 40 minutes where they give some information, but not enough. If we were allowed to get off the bus and have an audio or guided tour where you get more depth, that would be better. If you are in a wheelchair, it is tough for a manual one because they have to lift you on and off the boat and a worker will push you around to keep up with the tours. There are appropriate toilets for those with disabilities. As the political prisoners age and pass away, the management will have to find a way to capture their voices and lessons andmake sure what they bring to the experience outlast them and their lives. After the bus tour, you barely have time to go in the toilet and gift shop before they are herding you back on the boat back to Cape Town. I am still glad I went. I just wish I got more out of the experience."

They assume you know details about the history and therefore don't share it. The tour made one stop on the island where you can buy food and coffee and they were out of coffee - this was huge service and revenue driver miss for them!

It is a significant historical site in SA and interesting to see and learn about the conditions. Being such an important and popular site (heaps of tourists) I felt the tour could have been better. You spend most of your time on the ferry, followed by a bus drive with some commentary before doing a walk through the max security section. More time to look around with written info or videos would have been good. The boat ride was horrible. The whether is beyond the control of the operators but the ferry itself was old with limited good seating, and lots of diesel fumes. Many people feeling sea sick. Overall fairly expensive and takes up a pretty big chunk of the day. If prone to sea-sickness give it a miss."

We booked the morning tour so we arrived a little before our departure time for the boat. It was really busy and the boat left exactly on time so I would suggest to anybody to get there in plenty of time. Had a lovely boat ride over to the island which in itself was worth the money. When we arrived on the island we had to catch one of the buses waiting for us. Again I would suggest being quick as seats fill up fast and we ended up standing up on the tour. We were the only ones without a seat despite booking which was dissapointing but I think just a mistake on their part for which they apologized. The rest of the tour made up for this start to the day. It was really interesting driving round the island with the guide providing lots of infomation in a fun way. We stopped off a few times to take photos and ended up at the prison where we met with a former inmate of the prison. He was amazing and this truly was the best part of the tour. To hear first hand his experience was truly moving and is something neither me or my friend will ever forget. I would definitely recommend to anyone visiting Cape Town to do this tour as it only takes half a day but you get to see a part of South African history and hear first hand what went on. He even allowed us to ask him questions, some personal and made everybody feel so welcome. Definitely worth a visit, its excellent I just feel a little more organisation would be an improvement on what was the highlight of our trip. Having said that it did not take away from this fantastic experience you would get no where else in the world."

Boat trip itself no problem whatsoever.When we arrived at the island there was a small caf\u00e9 on the quayside, but, though a very warm day and we didn't have a drink with us, we couldn't stop or buy anything as buses were waiting to depart and you're not allowed to go alone without a guide. The bus trip was very frustrating as the view is naturally limited and stops very frequent and very short. In fact for the first part of the journey there isn't all that much to see which relates to Nelson Mandela. The bus then stops inland whilst people buy a drink, but as there are a few buses the queue is long and, once more, the time is too short....... long queues too for the toilets, but then on the way back to the bus, we came across another toilet hidden away with no-one in and no queue!The second part was much more interesting, seeing the quarry where the prisoners worked before visiting the prison proper on foot. This part of the visit was led by an ex-prisoner who was excellent at explaining life as an inmate. His powerful voice compelled attention to his harrowing story. Without doubt this was the highlight of the visit.Once more though, no time to muse alone on what life must have been like for them nor to wander around or read the large posters about life there, as there was only time to walk back to the dock for the boat, where once more the pressure was on, this time to board the boat back.This should be an occasion where one can reflect upon life in South Africa, both then and now, for the indigenous peoples, and the lives of the men who made those changes happen, but because of the sheer number of visitors and the consequent organisation, there is simply not the time, nor occasion, to fully appreciate the importance of what happened there and how it heralded the end of apartheid.But on the way back people on the boat were thrilled by the unexpected sight of a whale surfacing and quite blowing close to the boat!"

I had previously toured places like Ellis Island in New York and Alcatraz in San Francisco, and I thought the experience would be similar: a self-guided audio tour that gave me plenty of time to learn and go through the emotions of apartheid at my own pace. Instead, they have this tour set up in groups led by ex-political prisoners. While that sounds amazing, it is in fact frustrating, because our guide's accent was so thickly Namibian that none of the U.S. or Canadian tourists (or even one native South African tourist) could understand what he was saying. I left knowing nothing, and had no time to even read the placards on the walls because I had to stay with him as the tour guide. I'm sure he has a great story to tell, as does Robben Island, but I did not learn it on this tour because the way the whole thing is set up just isn't conducive to learning. It's nearly a total language barrier for North American English-speakers."

Sure, the Historical significance is important but they advertised a chance to see the African Penguins and the option to take a walk instead of the bus tour. No, that did not happen. We were marshaled onto buses immediately. No choice!! Ok, I could get into that but the bus tour was a waste of time. We saw some run down buildings and then stopped at a gift shop for 20 minutes. We then saw a limestone quarry but we could go in because the officials were afraid we would steal some rocks. We had to view from a distance.Finally we reached the prison. I figured time was running out so I asked if I could take the Penguin walk as advertised. No.......was the answer. You have to be dismissed by the person giving you the tour of the prison. Ok....I could live with that since we told we would have an half hour left to either do the penguin walk or go to the main gift shop.Well the prison tour was brutal. Hordes of people clamoring to hear a well meaning but ineffective former prisoner talk about the jail. I couldn't figure out what he was saying. When we got to Mandela's cell [right at the very end of the tour], I saw nothing.......just tons of tourists snapping picture with their cell phones. I figured I would let the group I was in pass and then I could go back and see the cell. No such luck, another group of people descended like bees to honey [ the polite description] and that opportunity evaporated quicker than water in the desert!!But wait, that was the end and there still was 20 minutes left to see the Penguins!! NO...more talk in a big room. I understood nothing and I was not alone. Others in the group were clearly frustrated. Now all the time is gone........we are dismissed. But wait!!!! time has run out and some people are running to catch the good boat to go back.I asked tour how much time I had to do the walk. He said 5 minutes as the old broken down boat was returning and we had to be on that. I asked about taking the next boat. He said no as all the boats were full and if I stayed I would be left on the island.Cool......love that customer service. I felt like a prisoner the whole time. Maybe that was part of the experience. I had a great time in South Africa and Cape Town. I thoroughly loved the place but at Robben Island........I was \"robbed'!!"

The trip within the island is done on a tour bus with a guide who nicely explains the geography of the island, The various work and stay places of the arrested fighters, Their struggles and strategy planning areas, along with the segregated prison cell types for various kinds of inmates. One ex-prisoner will also share his experience and knowledge of the prison which can sometimes get very serious for the visitors. Well the is real history and it is good to know what happened during that time. The thought of swimming from Robben Island to Cape town with Table Mountain as an inspiration is an eye opener and with freezing water temperatures, It is still hard to believe that such a thought existed among the fighters.

I was charged more than triple the cost of the item and didn\u2019t notice until I returned home. Two of my travel companions and another man purchasing at the same time were also overcharged which I wasn\u2019t aware of until after I had boarded the ferry back to Cape Town. Be very weary of that store. Double check your purchases and receipts before you sign and try to get souvenirs from the mainland (where the same types of items are sold more cheaply) rather than the Robben Island Museum store as the likelihood of getting ripped off is high. The fact that several people had the same experience demonstrates that this is standard practice for the store.Good luck."

Although I know the story about Apartheid, what I have learnt has been from the news at the time so my husband and I decided to go on the Robben Island tour.Firstly we boarded the ferry for a fabulous 50 minute journey across Cape Town harbour. We were lucky enough to have excellent weather, superb vis and outside seating so there were photo opportunities galore. This really is THE way of seeing Cape Town at it's stunning best.Upon arrival at Robben Island, we boarded coaches and were given a tour showing us the school, church and camps from an informative and interesting guide who also managed to keep the gravity of the situation on the island during the time of emprisonment whilst not being intimidating about it.We were then taken to the prison cells where Mandela, Sobukwe and many others were kept. With something written on many walls of the cells and some personal artifacts, this is an emotional and heartwrenching tour. The guides are ex-prisoners - ours was excellent and told a humbling story about his 6 year incarceration. Whilst listening to his time, we were all seated on benches, beds and floors that held the prisoners in a huge cell.Upon exiting the prison, where you can feel the atrocities of such recent history, the brilliant sunshine seems almost incongruous. Whilst Robben Island without doubt harbours harrowing history, the story is one that all visitors to Cape Town should experience and when you exit the prison, you feel like you're walking the long road to freedom too."

Beyond pointless \"rest stop\" at a snack bar for the pure purpose of making more money off tourists buying overpriced snacks. Waste of time.

No time to explore gift shop or native penguin colony on island. Return boat trip awful on same boat. Cold, slow, smelly, got seasick. Save your time and money and just read about the island instead.

The guides are all former prisoners so see it while you can because they won't be around years from now which makes it very intimate. Very cool to see Mandela's cell, makes you honour and appreciate the man that much more. That aside, this is the best place to get great shots of Cape Town with Table Mountain in the background. Plus the boat ride out is very cool. It's an amazing day out, you get views, seals jumping by the boats, a very huge appreciation of one of the greatest Men in history (and all the other men who were there with him). If you want to view Cape Town's beauty and you appreciate South Africa's history - this is a must do.

But they made it really interesting with a former political prisoner as a tour guide. And Robben Island is interesting apart from the prisons. Some downsides. They use a really old boat as a ferry that probably predates the prison - it has been breaking down. Nearly every seat is below (sea sick city). Get there really early to grab one of the seats above if you want one - topsides is either quite cold, or brutally hot in strong sun. On the good side, the boat trip is very pretty on a clear day and the boat is quite large and heavy with good stability. The tour has you very crowded into poor quality bus with dirty windows, and there is only one stop. So you don't see anything well except at the three locations - dock, end of the island and political prison. I am told there is a good gift shop, but they did not leave us time to go. At the docks we felt like they were recreating the prison years for us - could all of those young women running the place have been guards or prisoners? You have to go."

I am a quadriplegic from a gymnastics injury sustained at Michigan State University in April 1991 who is interested in global travel and participating in activities not normally associated with disabled people. I\u2019m currently on an adventure that will explore worldwide handicapped accessibility. Many people have travel blogs, but there are none that I know of that come from the vantage point of a wheelchair user going off the accessible path.The boat for Robben Island leaves from Mandela Gateway. There\u2019s an elevator to the staging area and a ramp from the staging area to the dock that is too steep that I need help up. The boarding platform to the boat is about 6\u201d high that the crew helps me up and carries me onto the boat.The 5 mile ferry ride on board the Dias to the island is about 1hr 10min. The Dias was used to transport staff and political prisoners between the mainland and Robben Island, including Nelson Mandela. The other ferry that is used, Sikhululekile, would only take about 20 minutes but is being serviced. With the bad weather coming in the seas are picking up. The ferry ride is rough and wet. We arrive at Murray\u2019s Bay Harbour and disembarking is not very easy or safe. There\u2019s a five step latter that 3 crew members carry me up in my chair. The width of the hand railings is barely wider than my chair. I can\u2019t see many people in a wheelchair being able to get on or off this boat. From the photo on the website, the Sikhululekile ferry would be much easier to board and disembark. Robben Island was first used as a political prison in the mid 1600\u2019s. This island was turned into leper colony in 1846. From 1961 to 1991, enemies of the apartheid were held in the maximum security prison. After arriving on the island, we board a large bus for a 40 minute tour of the island. The bus has a lift that\u2019s not much wider or longer than my chair with no safety belt.The tour starts with a stop at the leper graveyard then Robert Sobukwe House. In 1960, Sobukwe was sentenced to three years in prison for leading a nationwide protest of the Pass Laws. He was kept in solitary confinement in his own living quarters and had no contact with any other prisoners. Our next stop is the Garrison Church, constructed in 1841.Next, we take break at the gift shop for a few photos. The gift shop is accessible with ramps. The next stop is the lighthouse commissioned in 1865. The tour continues to the limestone quarry where Mandela, with other prisoners, worked digging up rock for 13 years. Our last stop, before a visit to the maximum security prison is Moturu Kramat. A sacred site for Muslim pilgrimage, built in 1969 to commemorate Sayed Adurohman Moturu, the Prince of Madura.The ramp to the maximum security prison is accessible. Our guide is former prisoner, Zozo, who arrived on Robben Island as a political prisoner in 1977 before his release in 1982. We start at the entrance where the prisoners were processed upon arrival. Political prisoners were kept in the maximum security prison while murderers and rapists were kept in the minimum security prison. We made our way through the jail to the prison yard. The ramp down to the prison yard is too steep. Prisoners would work hammering stones in the prison yard.The ramp from the prison yard to cell block B is too steep that I need help up. Zozo pulls me aside for a spot in front of cell #5. Cell #5 is Nelson Mandela\u2019s cell and has been left in the same condition since his release on Feb 11, 1990. The cell is 7 feet by 9 feet where Mandela spent 18 of his 27 years in prison on Robben Island. The lights in the maximum security prison were on 24 hours a day.Zozo next takes us to cell block F, one of the cell blocks he stayed in his time on Robben Island. I am able to make it down the ramp from cell block B to the prison yard but need help up the ramp to the jail. Zozo was also housed in cell block E and G. There is a step to cell block F that I need help up. Zozo talks of life in prison. During his time he went through beatings, hunger and solitary confinement. Some prisoners were only given hard padding to sleep on. Zozo closes the tour by saying: \u201cOur leader, Nelson Mandela, taught us not to take revenge on our enemies and because of this today we are free, free, free.\u201dOn May 10, 1994 Nelson Mandela was inaugurated as the country\u2019s first black president. In 1997 the prison was turned into the Robben Island Museum. I get helped down the ladder the same as before and to the interior of the boat. I meet Christo Brand, who was Nelson Mandel\u2019s prison guard, on the ferry ride back. I have the privilege to get a photo with Mr. Brand when we return to the Mandela Gateway. He has a book that came out Nov. 18, 2014 on his years being Mandela\u2019s prison guard, Mandela: My Prisoner, My Friend. The tour was great. Hearing from a former prisoner was exceptional. Zozo gave an amazing tour. The Dias ferry is not accessible. The bus has a lift but any wide or longer wheelchair will not fit. The ramps to the prison yard are too steep but with help they are manageable. The bus tour was about 40 minutes long. I could have spent 2-3 hours seeing more of the island. Check on which boat is being used. Check on the dimensions of your wheelchair to make sure it will fit on the lift. There is only one bus with a lift. The Robben Island tour is a must see if you visit Cape Town.Photos of the Robben Island Tour can be viewed at http://offtheaccessiblepath.smugmug.com/Africa/South-Africa/Robben-Island/Robben-Island/Accessibility wise this tour would receive a 2.5/5 rating."

On arrival, it's a ramshackle old bus that takes you round the island and things are pointed out at random with little chance to take photographs.The high points are- meeting an ex prisoner from the island and hearing his first hand account of being there (and everyone wants to know - why were you jailed?) and- seeing Mandela's cell and pondering what a cruel time it must have been.But it's all a bit disjointed. Modern technologies could have been used with maybe some contemporary news footage from that era and a brief historical documentary to put everything in perspective. Instead, it seemed too much like a production line of visitors being herded through to maximise income on the basis that they'll come, whatever we show them. \"Bus them round the island and get them back on the boat before the next lot arrive.\""

It started with the ferry boat being totally disorganized, you scramble into it, and if you don't get a sit straight away you will spend the 45 minute trip to Robben Island standing. there are no safety instructions given and no mention of where life jackets could possibly be hiding!!!Considering that last year a similar ferry sunk whist doing this same trip- shocking. Not only does nothing get offered, there is no sign of any staff the whole of the 45 minutes and certainly no announcements or dialogue /narration is made. Not too sure if there were any toilets as I didn't dare get up from my seat!!!Arriving there was the same scramble to get out without any communication as to what one needed to do. The first impression you get is one of filth and serious neglect. You then get taken on a bus tour past the ghost town- there are supposedly 200 inhabitants still living on Robben Island but it looks abandoned and in some serious need of paint and love and care!!!! You get taken to the quarry where Nelson Mandela toiled away but its just for a look and take a photo as you don't get out of the bus. You then get a pit stop, in theory to go to the bathroom and get a snack, this is probably 2 hours after you've gotten onto the ferry!!!You get get to types of plastic wrapped sandwhiches and a cooldrink/coffee or water. Surely as a tourist attraction, and when that sees many a tourist, one have a better facility here and provide not only income for the island but also job creation for a couple of its 200 inhabitants!!! But the best was yet to come!!!!!, we then were rushed off to the prison where our tour guide was an ex- prisoner who not only barely spoke English but who singled handedly managed to waffle through the 15 minute tour through the prisoner. Very little factual and historical information was given . Trully a disgusting tribute to the memory of those that fought for liberation and especially Mr Mandela. On returning back on the ferry, a Bristish tourist commented on how disappointed he was as he had booked months in advance to come to Robben Island for the purpose of seeing Mr Mandela.s cell and his guide- an ex- prisoner as well, didn't even bother to stop and point it out!!!!DO NOT bother to waste money on this attraction, get a virtual tour app on your phone and read the book-you will learn more."

Make sure you take the organized trip from the Nelson Mandela Gateway museum. The regular ferry does NOT give you the full tour. A camera is a must as well, as the island has a stark beauty about it, and it's the best place to get panoramic shots of Cape Town proper. Be forewarned, however- the island is several kilometers past the harbor breakwater. The ride can get pretty rough.

We were lucky to obtain the only 2 available tickets for the duration of our 4 day visit to Cape town. You get a fantastic view of Cape town and table mountain from the island.

Just a simple map and rough schedule of what you will be doing while visiting Robben Island would have made this visit excellent."

The boat ride there and back took ages and they basically ride you around in an ancient bus and give poor information. Also, we could barely hear what our tour-guide was saying and not because of his accent!! We really were all completely bored out of our minds, I advise them to make a half an hour video with live footage and proper information. I just want to tell the truth to save others from this! If you are thinking of going please ask someone who has already gone! Not only a waste of money but a real waste of time as well"

It took me a long time to finally visit Robben Island due to the endless negative publicity associated with the running of this attraction - mismanagement, issues with ferries etc. etc. Having finally done so, I can't say that I was blown away by the experience.We were lucky enough to be able to select great weather conditions - some cloud kept the hot sun at bay and the sea was really calm. Our boat, the 'Sea Princess', was one of the newer ones but a few of the others looked like old fishing trawlers.There are 2 parts to the tour - a guided walk through the prison (conducted by an ex convict) and a bus drive through part of the island. The walk through the prison was informative but very rushed - I would have much preferred to walk through at my own pace perhaps using pre-recorded info. We were a big group and often the guide had started talking before everyone had gathered so people missed some bits of information. In addition, the African English accent can be hard to follow - especially for foreign guests. The involvement of the political prisoners is an interesting one, but of course this will have a time limit in the long run as they get older. I hope that the company who runs this attraction has a plan to collect their stories and for running the tours after they have retired.I never really got a feel for the whole place at the pace we were marched through and I could have done with having a map of the prison and the island. It is astonishing that after all this time that this simple tool isn't available.The bus tour is ok - made better by the informative guide. The buses are not great for viewing. Even if you get a window seat, it is possible that a sight will appear on the opposite side of the bus. Each place the bus stops has informative plaques, but they don't allow you off the bus until you get to the view point/ coffee kiosk. The stop is short and the queues are long, so avoid the sad sandwiches, take your own snacks and rather enjoy the view.There are some great displays in the gateway where the boats leave from, but you can't read them while you are queuing for the boats.Would I recommend this attraction? Compared to the other attractions Cape Town has to offer, this one is the least well executed in it's approach. It takes most of a day and has a high risk of being unpleasant if the weather isn't good. If you don't have the time to spare, but appreciate the history, rather visit the District Six Museum or the Apartheid Museum if you are going to Johannesburg. Only visit if the history is very important to you and the weather is good. It's a pity - this attraction has a lot of potential and could be a lot better."

Old boats with inadequate seating. The 8 mile journey took over an hour each way. On the return trip it was quite choppy and several passengers looked very uncomfortable.As others have noted, once you arrive you are given a bus \"tour\" of the island. This is really nothing more than driving around the island in a very old and cramped bus while a guide narrates. Aside from the gravel pit and the actual prison, there is little to see on the island so the bus portion is a poor use of time. Once this concluded, you are provided an ex-prisoner for the tour of the prison. This was interesting, but it was difficult to hear and understand the prisoner and it felt like he was speaking from a memorized script. We were then led out through a gift shop which really cheapened the whole experience.All in all, it was meaningful to see Mandela's cell, but it was a big use of time for little in return."

It's just a plain cement room about 5 feet by 7 feet. You also get a bus tour of the island which is about 7 miles long. It's all fairly old and not very well kept. The whole tour is about 4 or 5 hours long and costs only about $15 US. The boat leaves from a waterfront area that is quite interesting...lots of shopping and restaurants.

The stop at the cafe was for 10 minutes and once everyone had decanted the bus, lined up for the toilet, tried to buy a drink and take some photos, I missed out on the photo opportunity and a drink. The tour around the jail was great but once again it was rushed. The volunteers that take you around have some amazing stories and was the only reason I gave this trip some points.

I was left completely underwhelmed by my trip to Robben Island and I regret opting to go here instead of to the Cape Point during my brief stay in Cape Town. It amazes me that I had to book the tickets in advance because the other slots over that weekend were completely booked out.The ferry service was too slow and meant that our time on the island was rushed and not very informative. We were advised by the staff that the whole experience would last about 4hrs, but instead it was closer to 5 and a half hours.Despite being towards the top of the queue (after queuing for almost an hour) before we were allowed to board the ferries we were almost herded onto the older and slower of the two boats (the Dias - avoid, avoid, avoid) and that effectively ruined our day. We took so long to get to the island that it felt as though we were constantly being pushed onto the next stage of the tour and never got a chance to stop and take a look around or read some of the exhibits that were on show.The tour of the prison was most unsatisfactory. We were hurried past Mandela's cell, with barely a chance to take a photo and no narrative, there was no explanation of the significance of the football pitch within the jail and our guide had to cut short his talk about his own experiences as an inmate because he wanted to make sure he caught the last ferry home (as it transpired, he had nothing to worry about because we were left sitting on the pier for a good 30 minutes before it arrived).The one good feature of the tour was the brief bus ride around the island where a different guide gave us some really interesting insights into the island, it's significance and the current difficulties facing SA. However, there was probably no need for a 10 minute break mid-way through what was probably a 30 minute tour overall - particularly since we had all been sitting on that blasted boat for so long just before that!We read in the local press the next day that there are efforts being made to improve the experience and to upgrade the ferries but until this happens I won't be recommending this tour to anyone."

Nice easy ride, with beautiful view. On arrival, the large group is assigned to buses that drive you through some areas. The tour guide was actually the best of the tour and explained the significance of the sites we were shown. Eventually we were lead to the old high security prison and were guided thru by an ex-inmate who unfortunately rambled thru the history without engaging the listeners, making it a surprisingly very boring activity. Even when you are shown Mandela's cell, there is no attention to the history.I believe they could do much more with what they have and should have at Robben Island. Clearly they could make it a more interesting, educational and maybe interactive site to appeal to younger and international crowds. I would have been happy in staying longer at the island if I could had the opportunity to read, watch and learn more about the area and it's history. The Robben Island Museum should probably be moved to the site and add an additional interesting element.

Having just visited Alcatraz in San Francisco a few weeks before I was very interested in comparing the two experiences where countries chose to lock up their prisoners in islands in sight of large cities. It really struck me that while in the USA, the prisoners were really bad guys--bank robbers and murderers--at Robben Island the prisoners where people fighting for their civil rights--the ability to move about freely and to vote in their own country. And for that they were locked up for decades, and in the case of Nelson Mandela and others, forced to chip limestone in the blazing heat and sun 8 hours a day, 5 days a week. The trip is long--but it's because they really want visitors to understand the story and the fight for freedom--so there is a bus tour and walking tour. The walking tour of the prison is led by former prisoners and is very moving. I came away truly in awe of what Mandela and others did to earn the right to vote---which didn't happen until the mid 1990's. It's a story that can never be forgotten--and a place that helps you learn more about how recent it is in the countries history that 80% of the population was give their right to vote."

It feels like the whole tour revolves around getting you to Nelson Mandela's cell which is a bit of an anti climax tbh, but this is just a personal opinion.I would still recommend someone visiting Cape Town to go to Robben Island, i just feel the experience could be delivered much better."

There were so many people that we had to wait a further 20 minutes for another boat to take us over. The anticipation in terms of what you're going to see is immense. On arrival at Robben Island we were herded onto 2 buses. This was the frustratiang part as we spent too much time on the bus looking at various different areas without being able to get off & really absorb the atmosphere.Our final bus stop was at the prison where we were met by one of the prisoners.Shame these groups are so big as you just want to ask a million questions about their lives & time spent on the island. Our guide around the prison was very interesting & informative. The suspense starts to build as all you really want to see is where the great man himself spent all those years. What strength of character this wonderful & amazing man Nelson Mandela had to get through his time on Robben Island in such a confined & desolate space in the way that he did.It is a shame you can't walk around many of these areas freely & before you know it, it's time to head back.........so very glad we took the time out to go and see."

No information is given in terms of what boats can or can't be used, we ended up taking 'Dias' boat across which is slow and reduces your time to properly explore the island. Buses meet you at the port, but no one to coordinate filling these buses. Our tour guide was also the bus driver. At each stop he left his seat to talk us through each point of interest, which delayed our trip around the island. He we very knowledgable of the island and history but limited on the bird life, flora and forna and animal life on the island. When we go to the max security prison there was no guide to meet us off the bus, so our group literally joined another guided group only to miss the main exhibit. Although very interesting and certainly a 'must do' l found the trip generally chaotic and rushed. Small attention to detail such as someone to coordinate filling boats and busses and staggering the dispatch of busses, and a guide with a sign indicating what group he is taking around would certainly help. Alternately lay out the museum with more information, heads sets and allow visitors the option of a self guided tour. Would also be nice to open up to the public some of the other buildings such as the churches, schools and guest house."

The boat then took over an hour to get to the island. Rushed onto buses when we arrived at the docks and driven quite fast around the island. Couldn't even get out to take photos of places like the lime quarry. The ex prisoner guide on the bus sounded like he had given the same speech one too many times. No interest. Arrived at the actual prison then are again felt like we were being rushed around by the ex prisoner again telling us we had two minutes to look here and three to look there. Not a very enjoyable experience. Couldn't get a feel for the island or life there. Didn't mind having to walk to the jetty again to catch the bus because we wanted to look in the gift shop and read the visual aids along the dock too but then we were told we needed to get straight back on the boat for the mainland again. No time to soak in the islands atmosphere and history. Arrived back two and a half hours later than expected due to all the problems which threw off our plans for the rest of the day. No consideration at all for the paying customers. Would not recommend it."

Sparks managed to get across emotively how poor the conditions were for the political inmates and the terrible atrocities they suffered. He took us into the main section where he spent 7 years. The fact that he and others like him have forgiven their wardens and live with them as friends on Robben Island is a commendable testament to their beliefs and values and shows their true strength of character without which they would never have survived.

Very well organised from the boat leaving by the Clock Tower on the waterfront to the tour around the island by bus. Whilst on the boat the crew would point out anything of interest and we saw a whale with its young calf, very unexpected at that time of year. Once on the island you are taken by bus with a guide who explains each part as you drive around. This includes the guards accommodation (and their families), churches and the quarry where Nelson Mandela and other prisoners would break stones day in day out in searing hot sun. At this spot we didn't get off the bus which would have been nice to have the opportunity to take photographs. We understood that you would not be able to walk on or around the quarry but to get off the bus would have been good. The best part of the trip is that an ex-prisoner guides you around the prison on foot. He gives a very personal touch to the tour. Explanations are clear and he was very willing to answer any questions. Very well done. It's well worth visiting whilst in Cape Town, it's pot luck with the weather though for the crossing by boat!!"

We should have been back in Cape Town at 6.00pm but didn't make it until after 8.00pm. There was no safety briefing on the way back even though the seas were rough.

Why that amount of tickets are sold with the possibility of not getting on the boat who knows. When people protested the staff just laughed and continued to let people jump in so not great. The trip out eventually and the tour of the island by one of the inmates at the time of Mr Mandella being their was truly fascinating and moving felt privileged to walk here and hear the stories so great trip but tour operator you need to sort the issues out with your staff really poor behaviour.

Cape Town itself is a truly beautiful city and we enjoyed every minute of our stay.During our stay we visited so many wonderful places - our trip enhanced by the politeness and helpfulness of everyone we met.A visit to Robben Island was high on our list of places to visit. As we approached the jetty the prison appeared and as we walked up to the entrance of the prison we were reminded of the terrible conditions that the prisoners had to endure. The murals on the way to the prison depicted the struggle for freedom made by those brave men.Our tour guide was himself an ex prisoner on Robben Island and described in detail the hardships that he and his fellow prisoners had to endure. What clearly came across was the intellect of this man. He articulated his experiences to all of us with such passion which was tempered with a feeling of forgiveness for the perpetrators of such inhuman crimes.It was a very interesting and highly charged visit and one which I will never forget. The visit to Nelson Mandela's cell was very evocative. The men incarcerated on Robben Island were not criminals but men with vision, spirit and intellect.I was very moved by my visit and as I left that day I wanted to thank this brave and humble man for the tour but I just couldn't speak as I felt overwhelmed.I shook his hand and embraced him. He knew well the way I was feeling but I just couldn't utter any words. He said that it is difficult to understand how man could be so inhuman to his fellow man. It was a privilege to meet such a humble and dignified man.A visit to Robben Island cannot be more highly recommended by me and I hope that you will will have the opportunity to visit this symbol of man's struggle against the odds to achieve a better and freer society."

But there are also places you visit to learn and pay respect to what happened there. Robben Island off the coast of Cape Town, South Africa is such a place. Robben is the Dutch word for seal and they have long shared the island with penguins, sea birds and tortoises, things. Once man inhabited the island, it became a place that brought out the cruelest aspect of human behavior. From the late 17th century until it became a World Heritage Site less than 20 years ago, this island was used to incarcerate free thinking men. For over 300 years it was a place that robbed men of their basic human dignity, a place dedicated to breaking man\u2019s spirit and his will to live free. The island itself is a windswept coral outcropping covered with thick brush and rocks. Everything is coated with limestone dust from the quarry that once served as a place prisoners were pushed to the breaking point. The island\u2019s shoreline and shallow waters are littered with broken ships that stand as a reminder to the many broken spirts that haunt the island. There was one prisoner whose spirit not only could not be broken, it soared higher during his incarceration- 18 out of a total 27 years spent on Robben Island mining lime stone with his hands. Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela suffered the 100-plus degree heat and the cold damp chill of winter for the crime of standing up for the basic human rights of his people.  I walked the island. I stood and starred into the limestone pit. I listened to the recollections of our guide, a former prisoner with Mandela. Tears formed in my eyes when I looked into the closet that was his cell. Only hunger strikes led by him, and the sickness that ensued, resulted in prisoners being able to move from sleeping on the floor to sleeping on cots. He had every right to be angry at his captors. He had even more reasons to be bitter over how he had been treated. Instead he led a nation back from the brink of total isolation and united black and white to forge a new government, a new land, a new freedom and a new peace.The boat ride to the island is easy and affords great views of the harbor and Table Mountain. A visit to the island combines a bus tour with knowledgable, entertaining guides with a walking tour of the prison led by a former political prisoner. A great learning experience. For those who say there is no justice in the world, I point to Robben Island, a very interesting place worthy of your time and your respect."

The second part was conducted in the gaol by a former prisoner. He was difficult enough to understand but it was plain that he was not a fan of Mandela's and talked about other people more. Not a single thing did he tell us about his daily schedule etc. etc. To make matters worse, another guide was shouting so loud that he drowned out half of what he was saying.This is a totally amateurish presentation compared to Alcatraz which I've seen or Cork Prison which I've also seen."

You then stop at the prison blocks where you get a short talk from one of the prisoners, then shown Nelson Mandela's cell. The tour guide is knowledgeable about the island, however, I did not feel there was enough said about apartheid, the politics at the time and how it was abolished.

Robben Island is a place that everyone should visit at least once in their lifetime as it is a very important part off the history of South Africa and the whole issue of forgiveness. Once you have been, you realise just how significant the peaceful transition was to democracy and how magnanimous Nelson Mandela and his co-prisoners were. We also found it very moving that our tour guide was a previous political prisoner. However, the trip and tour is a little disorganised, too rushed and the facilities (not the prison but the support facilities) are not great, but we were, in the spirit of forgiveness, more than willing to overlook this and it was a very moving and memorable visit."

Our boat left early which is strange considering that the tickets quote a specific boat; what would the people who turn up with ten minutes to spare do? On arrival at the harbour no one directs you to the coaches so there are scores 1/2/3 boatloads of people milling around uncertain about where to go. Specifically, the prison guide was a grave disappointment because he was so hard to understand and those who could not follow his strongly accented English [most of the group] were totally perplexed and kept asking for others in the crowd to repeat what was being said. But the worst part of the trip was to be left unaccompanied on a coach for almost an hour in the midday sun with no information about why we were going nowhere. No one came to tell our group of about 40 people why we had been left so, and only after we left the coach to find a staff member did we find out that the guide had not reported for work and that there was no replacement. Each tourist/group had to go and find out for themselves that we had been abandoned, that we could not tour the island, and that we had to make our way to the harbour on foot to get back to Cape Town on any boat that would take us. There was a Korean couple on our coach who were frantic with the various delays because they had to get back to the mainland to catch a flight home. At the harbour it was like the first day of the sales with hundreds of people trying to get onto boats as they came in - beware elderly, small children, disabled because they were all pushed out of the way. Some of our coach group were unlucky and left behind with no boat in sight. On our return a handful of us went to the Customer Service Desk and explained what had happened. I spoke to Krystal who went to speak to her manager and returned with forms to complete for a 100% refund. The manager did not have the courtesy to make an appearance. Three months later I still await my refund and my emails have been ignored.Every business has problems and mistakes will be made but the true measure of a service business is to see how it recognises and rectifies mistakes. On that score this business failed miserably. My South African friends tell me that Robben Island has been soundly criticised for the way in which it has been managed, and I had first hand experience of why that is so. What a shame; this could be the number one attraction in South Africa."

I tried to get into the mood, but I never felt their suffering when he talked about it. I love historical sites and love thinking about what happened at different sights, but he never got under my skin. Then we were a full group passing by the cells where among others Mandela did spend way to many years of his life. But that left us with almost no time to suck in the athmosphere. After that we were gently guided directly to the ferry.I was expecting time to walk around the area but instead I kind of felt like I had been pushed around for a couple of hours."

The guides who drive the coaches around various parts of the island are excellent and give you a real feel of the place explaining that it once housed lepers as well as prisioners, and describing what the buildings were used for and who lives in them now. A political prisioner showed us the cells where Nelson and his fellow prisioners were held and what they had to endure. We also heard from Christo Brand who at the age of 18 was his prison officer.

This was my second visit to the island, and to be honest, there's nothing there that will tempt me back again.The experience is interesting - once - but the it depends to a very large extent on the character and approach of the guides who are ex-prisoners and friendly people, but who are not professionals either in the fields of guiding or history. That's not their fault, but when they're providing all the content, it's difficult if they're not on form.The visit comprises four parts: the ferry trip to the island; a guided tour of the island by bus and a guided tour of parts of the prison and the trip home.The ferry trip is always fun if you're into boating. There were three ferries of differing age operating the day we went and we were allocated the modern catamaran, which was fast and comfortable.The bus tour of the island is of some interest - but simply comprises a talk about some of the buildings and some information about the people who were confined there including Robert Sobukwe and others before him. During the prison tour you see Nelson Mandela's cell, the exercise yard and a few of the other buildings. I was blown away by my first visit to the island and ended up on a high - blown away by emotion and thankfulness for the person of Nelson Mandela and the people around him.This time, not so much. We felt more that we were part of a large crowd being relieved of their money as quickly as possible. The buildings and displays are dilapidated; the famous quarry abandoned to weeds.But with a little imagination, the island could be transformed into something far more worth experiencing - without turning it into a theme park.Just one example was the shop that you stop at during the bus tour. It reminded me bluntly of cafes in the poorer parts of the third world: there was a choice of about 4 items - a large fridge of bottled water, a couple of packets of chips and some rusks... Good grief! A well stocked shop would make a fortune! The ride home, into a raging southeasterly gale, was fun."

The boat then was a little cramped and 7 miles with African pop music blasting out is a little wearing.On the island it was sunny and windy. You walk to buses for an island tour and the guide was superb - funny, knowledgeable and engaging. The lime mine was especially poignant.After an hour (including a 15 minute stop off) you go to the prison itself to be shown round by one of the former prisoners. His insight was good but a little more content would be nice above and beyond his performance. Mandela's cell is simple and unobtrusive.Then it's back to the boats to be bullied into line by the very bossy Ousie who only had smiles for island inhabitants. Thankfully it was a different boat with a little more room and no music. Some might have liked that as the seas had really picked up!!!Overall this is interesting to do and good value considering the lengthy boat transfers and the hour and a half of guided tours. I would recommend it to anyone - it's not quite the emotion sapping experience that the Ann Frank house in Amsterdam is but it is in that general style"

I and my companions and many of the other folks on our tour were deeply moved by what we saw, heard and learned. However, be assured that it is not a somber experience, quite the reverse in fact. The tour guides are knowledgeable, friendly and accommodating - and above all cheerful. They breath life into a place of dread and despondency and in doing so are able to engage you thoroughly with the lives of the men who were incarcerated there - Nelson Mandela in particular of course - and their struggle. You leave Robben Island with a far greater understanding of the politics of apartheid and the courage of those - of all colours - who fought it and prevailed. Btw look out for Christo Brand, Mandela's old prison guard, in the island's bookshop and make sure you leave with a copy of his book 'Doing Time with Mandela', - it's excellent."

We have great interest in history of racial suppression, having been greatly moved by the slave embarkation UNESCO sites in Ghana and in dakar, Senegal. And the Nelson Mandela story is as moving and important as any in the twentieth century. All over South Africa there are museums that brilliantly tell his story. Maybe that's why we were less impressed by this prison tour where the groups were super-large, and the guides, while uniquely qualified as former original prisoners themselves, were hard to hear and understand. The ferry service was pleasant enough going over; poor coming back, even on fairly smooth water because we happened to get put on a smaller, noisy, crowded craft in place of the quiter and faster catamaran we went over on. Could have been a little better organized on the island itself, too. So only three stars, even though the story and lesson are extremely important and valuable."

The boat trip from Cape Town is about 45 minutes each way and it can be choppy so if you are not a good sailor best avoided, although they do have sick bags on board. Once on the island you are taken on a tour in a bus with a commentary by an ex prisoner, quite a political talk and not a lot about what life was there. Then you get to the main prison compound and another prisoner takes you round, different political persuasion this time but still didn't learn much about life there or indeed the islands previous use as a hospital. I suppose it is a must do but you will probably learn more in the museum where the tour boats go from.Could be so much better"

We were toured round the island by bus with an excellent guide and then given a walking tour through the prison itself by an ex political prisoner. The rooms were bare, and Nelson Madelas cell and garden where there to see. A good talk on the workings of the prison. There were still ex wardens and their families living in the small village, which also had a church. Regretfully, like so many attraction in SA, the lack of funds means that the sites are deteriorating.

But getting there was a bit of nightmare, especially if you are old or handicapped. You first board one of two boats (a big catamaran or a decrepit old fishing boat which looks like its about to sink!). Everyone rushes to get in and shows no respect for the elderly (we were travelling with my friend's elderly parents). There is no such thing as priority boarding..Once at the island you get shuffled around in a school bus packed with people, you visit some sights like the limestone quarry and the beach where Mandela used to collect seaweed for fertiliser. At most of these attractions you cannot get off, and its hard to see much from the window. Our bus tour guide (of Malay background) was actually very knowledgeable and we learned a lot from him, but upon arriving at the actually prison we were guided by a black African ex-prisioner and no one in our group understood more than 20-30% of what he said in his heavy accent (a real shame as I think a lot of it was quite interesting!). Our tour group was huge, at least 40-50 people (basically everyone who was in the packed school bus), which made it hard to move around and see or hear anything. This group size is way too large! After leaving the prison we had to board the boats again which was a complete nightmare, again no priority boarding and no respect for elderly passengers, everyone just rushing and pushing their way into the boat, so when that was full we were told to walk another 100meters to another boat. My friends' poor parents were about to pass out in the heat and chaos. I know Africans are probably not renowned for their organisational skills but come on, you have plenty of paying foreigners visiting the island, put a little 'Western' organisational skills into the operation. I'm still glad I went. It would have been even better with individual audio guides for those who struggle with African english..."

The Guide on the bus was very knowledgeable, as was the (former prisoner) Guide in the prison but there didn't seem to be sufficient structure to the delivery of the information. This left us feeling a bit confused. They were keen to broaden our minds away from the predictable obsession about Nelson Mandela (when so many people were imprisoned here over a long period of time) but, of course, it's Nelson Mandela who was the main attraction as far as we (and other tourists, I guess) were concerned, so they could have made more of his story to encourage visitors to spread the word. The boat trips lasted about 40 minutes in each direction and it was a bit rough on the return journey, as the wind (and tide) was picking up. However, I can only commend the crew of the boat, as they responded so well to the tourists' excitement about seeing a number of whales on our return trip by slowing down and stopping, so we could get close enough to see the beautiful creatures.A worthwhile trip but could be even better."

Another couple in hotel reception faced with same problem although they had been sent an e-mail. Fortunately we managed to re-book but had to juggle our onwards plans that buggered us up to be honest but we really wanted to do the trip. Fortunately when Friday 13th arrived, the weather was awful and we were glad the trip had been cancelled!We arrived the next day to try again. Sunshine and blue skies all around. We ensured we arrived at the ferry terminal in plenty of time. We boarded the Thandi boat, which appeared new and was a quick crossing. The buses were waiting upon arrival and our tour guide was great. The prison tour and guide was fascinating although we wished we had been given time to explore ourselves. It was a very humbling experience and cannot be compared to Alcatraz in any way.The return boat was the same, luckily! The crossing over was so rough, we had to hang on for our lives! The weather was still great so we had great views of Cape Town and Table Mountain.We didn't experience the negative comments raised on here and can only praise the staff, apart from the lack of communication and assistance from the cancelled trip.The whole experience was very humbling and well worth it.

This tour is worth your time if you want to hear the personal story of the prisoner-tour guide and look forward to the boat ride to Robben Island and back. Otherwise, you're better off contributing to this memorial museum by buying a book about this place (at the tour center in the wharf area downtown) and putting your time to better use.The museum at the wharf-ferry landing presents the chronological history of the island as a leper and penal colony. But visitors not aware of some of this history over the centuries may find this approach lacking. There\u2019s a larger story to be told here. For example, if you visit the Golden Triangle museum in northern Thailand, you\u2019ll learn how the British Empire played the world as a checkerboard manipulating commerce, triggering the opium wars, and the consequential impacts to countries throughout the world to this day.A similar pattern of history needs to be told here about the Dutch and the British colonialists. It isn\u2019t enough they were here and subjugated peoples of color for centuries. The Dutch needed the Cape as a waypoint and trading post to support their settlement in the Dutch East Indies (the Far East). Colored peoples from Indonesia, Bali, China and elsewhere were seized as slaves and shipped in. Surprisingly, most of the slaves over the century were not solely from the African continent. The British had multiple reasons over the centuries for their actions here. The same multi-triangular relationships of exploitation and subjugation from continent to continent evident from the opium wars can be found here. This story is not told effectively. And it should be. Beyond the larger story, and less important overall, the details of this tour don\u2019t offer up the resounding throng of support for the overall theme. The Ferry's are overloaded. The Dias lists consistently with too many tourists aboard. Once you arrive on the island, you're shuttled around on a tour bus. This is good since it's a little too big for the lame and elderly to walk around. The island consists of many one-story, vacant buildings where terrible atrocities were inflicted on prisoners over the past four centuries. But a visit to the island does not impart a sense of value adding to the overall story all of us are aware of to some degree."

When visiting Capetown I expected the Robben Island experience to be a stand out cultural and educational trip, similar to how other major national landmarks showcase particular historical tours. I would compare this expectation to my previous visits to Ellis Island New York, S21/Killing Fields Cambodia, Tower of London or Kilmainham Gaol Dublin. Sadly Robben Island doesn't even come close, which is a huge shame given the story it can tell of very recent times. Plenty already said about the boat trips, yes we queued and were delayed and it's not that short - about 40 minutes to make the crossing each way. The first half of the trip is on a standard bus, not open top. It stops at some landmarks where stories are told of their significance. After about 40 mins the bus arrives at a tuck shop/toilet area with good views across the bay to Capetown and Table Mountain. You're then brought to the prison and met by a guide who is an ex inmate. We were brought, at a decent pace, through some main areas of the prison and received broad explanations of each areas function coupled with some stories and brief history of inmates and prison life/circumstances. We queued in single file to walk past the Mandella cell, which is the only cell that contains any items to suggest what conditions were really like. This was followed by a sit down in a large communal cell for more stories before our 'walk to freedom' from the prison back to the dock, where our boat was delayed. I've no doubt that Robben Island will continue to be a major Capetown attraction and rightly so. However this trip lacks education, interaction and organisation. It could and should be an awful lot better. I hope that in years to come that Robben Island receives the funding required to transform it into the attraction that it deserves to be. It has a huge responsibility to tell an extremely important story that at the moment just isn't there.Disappointing."

I was disappointed that we only left the bus once during the trip, i.e. we couldnt stop and explore.

He had been imprisoned for 25 years for terrorism charges - in his case he had been on a demonstration against the government. This was utterly chilling - to think you could be incacerated for so long for actually not doing very much. We then toured the prison and saw Nelson Mandela's cell, the yard where he worked with other prisoners etc. I was disappointed that I didn't feel more emotion. Everyone knows about Robben Island and its history but it all seemed too sanitised. A great shame - I feel that if it had been left more as it originally was, dirt, warts and all it would have had more impact. I am glad I visited but left feeling something was missing. We returned on a different boat in fairly stormy water - I don't think I have ever been so frightened.

It's a shame that I had to title my review \"could have been so much better\" but that is the reality of what happened. When we arrived at the ferry dock in Cape Town it is was very crowded with long lines of people. We were concerned to see everyone making there way on to what looked like a very run down ferry boat that had definitely seen better days and were genuinely concerned to see how crowded it was becoming. It's only a short journey out to the island but it's still a wide open bit of water with a sizeable swell. We were relieved that when it came our turn to board we were re directed to a Catamaran on the right side of the dock. So, my advice immediately is to hang back and get on this boat. It was much newer, better and seemed much safer. They also played modern music on the way out which was nice. What was not in the plan was the sightings of numerous southern right whales which were still in the waters, they should have gone in December. This was excellent. On arrival at the dock on Robben Island we were directed to a bus which spent the next half an hour driving around the Island. The girl on the bus pointed out interesting sites on the tour. Again given the hoarders of people that clearly visit the island the bus could have been better. We eventually got off and were met by an ex inmate of the institution who then took us in to a room in the max security prison and gave us a talk. It was very interesting to hear his side of what happened just a few years ago and I wondered why he would ever want to spend his days here given all the terrible things he must have witnessed. Some people might have struggled with his accent but we were fine and it was all very moving and I am pleased to say no attempts were made to sanitise events. We were then shown the cell Mr. Mandela was detained in and the obligatory photos were taken as we walked past it. Then that was it, shown out the side and our \" short walk to freedom\" back to the dock ! I learned from my trip out on the catamaran and did the reverse, held back and waited until the hoarders got on the old boat then calmly boarded the lovely catamaran for the trip back where we were again blessed with the sites of the beautiful whales. Again the catamaran skipper manoeuvred himself into a position so we could all clearly see them with two actually passing under the boat !In summary they could definitely look to invest in better transportation to and on the Island but definitely worth the time........if you get the timing on to the boats right : )"

I hate comparing places, but the Alcatraz tour 20 years ago was better, , hopefully with the historical significance of Robben island more will done."

Although I am rating this as poor, there would be no man or woman in their right mind who could say based on a review I'll miss where Nelson Mandela was housed/kept for all those years.The boat ride over was fine, a little rough however added to the attraction, seeing penguins and seals on the way put in perspective just how cold the water is. The tour started on a rusty bus where an ex-prisoner introduced himself to a bus of 50-55 people without a P.A. system meaning most if not all the group didn't hear a thing. The tour then started by the ex-prisoner locking the group in a cell where-by once again speaking at the group without the use of a P.A. system. After 45minutes the group was allowed to leave the cell and the ex-prisoner continued with \"his tour\". One visit in enough."

The trip will take have a day to take this into consideration if you have limited time in Cape Town Pre-booking is essential and will save a lot of your time and effort.The ferry trip was quite enjoyable and even at your arrival the rustic non totally modern buses made the experience more real. It was very emotional to have had a former inmate as our tour guide and having him showing us where he slept and was held. Also to see the former guard of Nelson Mandela was quite interesting.It is amazing that with such history South Africa today is not inside a civil war with no end and that Nelson Mandela could taught sense to everyone even tough he was inside robben island. The thought that Nelson Mandela could come out of that environment a whole and inspirational human being is a miracle. The whole South African story post apartheid is a MIRACLE.This is A MUST SEE place to visit if you are in Cape-town."

I agree with the advice that pre-booking is essential and it does take a half day. Our trip was scheduled at 0900 and as is almost usual... one ferry was out of service. Take a jacket as the ride can be windy.Once we left the ferry we were shown to large buses where we first drove around the outer part of the island. Our guide was both articulate and very funny. I wish I could remember his surname but it began with an \"S\". The philosophy that is conveyed is that of acceptance and tolerance and is well scripted. Seeing the living conditions is very sobering. I think it is important to remember that prisons throughout Europe in those days were equally cruel and to not make it all about race and color. Still to think that Nelson Mandela could come out of that environment a whole and inspirational human being is a miracle.The guide on the bus had a microphone but the guard in the prison did not... if you are hard of hearing stick close to him."

The old ship we took to the island (I think it was the Dias, took 50 mins, with a sleek catamaran getting there much quicker - but it was full). This meant we were late, missed the buses and did the foot tour first. Although it is great to meet an old inmate there was a little too much talking and not enough walking in a large group of about 40 people. HIs accent was very strong and my children understood nothing. This would have been much better as an audio tour, taken at your own pace. The bus tour was , I am afraid, a waste of time, and felt like an excuse to take you to the cafe where you disembark, for 15 mins , with nothing to do except buy a drink ! This tour could be so much better with such history to be told. We came away thinking it was tired, resting on its laurels (it is clearly something everyone does when they visit) and needs a complete overhaul. One of the things we were looking forward to most, but the thing we were most disappointed with on our visit of CT"

This meant you got to see the lime quarry where Nelson Mandela and the other political prisoners were put to work every day. The tour guides are very knowledgeable and are ex-prisoners so they are able to talk to you about their experiences and how the prison was actually run. Parts of it I found very humbling and emotional, and not the enjoyable experience you might get from other tours, but it was very educational and so worthwhile. I came away amazed at just how much people had endured, how strong they all must have been and the big part women played during apartheid. Very inspiring and a must if in Cape Town."

This place, I suppose like Alcatraz or any other prison, holds a wealth of history and fascination and represents so much of the repression of apartheid. It's quite overwhelming to see Nelson Mandela's cell, as it is to see the identical cells of so many of the other prisoners - so many of them forced onto the island just for having certain ideas.I knew a certain amount before I went - what I didn't know was how freely people speak of a dark time that was only a few decades ago - nor did I know that people live on Robben Island, and some of these people include ex-political prisoners, as well as guards, all living together on one island, which is a very touching fact. And how proud most people of South Africa seem to be to have overcome this time in their history. On the trip, I found myself moaning that they had packed too many people on to the boat and bus that take you there and around, I certainly stopped when I got to the island on a blazing hot day and saw the concrete yard where prisoners took their walks, saw the meal allocations which were divided by colour, and heard the reasons some of the people where thrown onto this island in the first place - and seeing the pile of rocks of which Mandela placed the first one, at a reunion in the quarry where they were forced to work, followed by others until a large pile of stones was formed, symbolizing unification for all colours and people."

The boat was crowded. The bus was overcrowded. Opportunities to take photos and savour the historical significance of the site were severed by the rush and clamour of visitors competing for an opportunitiy.What is worse, however, is the sense one gets that the government department is using the island and tourist interest in it as a propaganda opportunity. The tour guides, despite their charm were not well informed and incapable of contextualizing the site. My general sense of the visit was that tourists felt underwhelmed and as if they were being taken for fools."

Everyone's experience here will be a little bit different, in part because one of the interpreters will be one of a number of former prisoners and each has their own story to relate. Each story will have its own power and its own meaning to the visitor. But I don't think most visitors can help but be moved. If you want to learn more history and perspective on South Africa's transition, this is a must-see. Keep in mind the boat journey can be 30-60 minutes in the South Atlantic so be prepared if you suffer from motion sickness. At a minimum, sit outside the boat and focus on a horizon. There is so much to see that should not be a challenge; the views of the City Bowl and Table Mountain alone are worth the effort. Bring a windbreaker--even in summer!Purchase tickets in advance at the Robben Island web site. For 30 rand, the souvenir photo is optional but a good deal--and I don't usually go for these sorts of pictures."

We even saw seals swimming and frolicking around in the ocean. Upon docking at Robben Islanf you board a bus that takes you up to the prison precint for the first half of the tour. There you will meet a tour guide, one of the former political prisoners on the island. He will give you a first hand account of what life was like as an inmate. You go through the living area, the recreational area and finally the cells - you will get to see the late and great Nelson Mandela's cell - a very moving experience. You then board the bus again and do a tour of the rest of the island, which is just as interesting and informative, before heading back to the mainland."

Once we were off the boat we were greeted by a guide who took us on a driven tour of the island to see where the prisoners worked in the lime quarry, robert sobukwe's house where he was kept in isolation, the guards houses and even some penguins. Once we reached the prison we met our tour guide, Kgotso Ntsoelengoe, one of the most fascinating men I've ever had the fortune to meet. He met us in front of the famous photo of robben island prisoners the day they were released and pointed to one of the smiling faces that was quite clearly his. Kgosto shared many stories with us throughout the tour, about the very first meal they had on release (kfc) , the political debates they would have every night, the guards who helped them get information from the outside - I could have listened to this ex-political prisoner talk all day. The most important thing to remember here is that in 40 or less years those visiting robben island will not have the same experience that we were lucky enough to have as these prisoners that spent their time here, with mandela and others will not be alive to share their stories first hand.Without ruining the rest of the tour for you I'd encourage everyone visiting cape town to make this trip, it's an experience I'll never forget."

There were more than 50 members in our group, including some young children. The large size made it impossible for everyone to hear our tour guide, except on the bus with the PA. Every stop we have to wait until everyone showed up, which made the tour more about waiting than learning history. Also, it was especially disappointing that some people in the group exhibited a severe lack of manner and have the unfortunate tendency of not following instructions given by the tour guides. At the end of the tour we were notified that our scheduled ferry was canceled and the replacement would come later. 45mins passed, a fishing trawler turned into refugee boat docked at the pier, everyone behind me frantically pushed onboard. This old noisy thing was also much slower than the other regular catamaran ferries, so we arrived back in Cape Town much later than we expected."

There were not enough buses for the amount of visitors and we did the walking tour of the prison first and the bus tour afterwards - the tour makes much less sense in this order and I would advise anyone to refuse if asked to follow the tour in this manner. The journey back to the mainland was nothing short of horrific in a tiny catamaran and not the usual comfortable ferry. Our children were physically sick and adults were screaming in terror. The crew were not trained to deal with such conditions. It felt like a miracle to get back to dry land. We discovered afterwards that the usual ferry was out of action and that they were chartering smaller vessels to ferry visitors to the island.

That part of the tour was amazing.But everything was badly organized: we booked early for the 15h00 tour, they requested ou presence 30min before the scheduled departed time, and we were there at 14h30 only to wait in the line for 40min an then another 10min outside in the sun. So the 15h00 tour arrived to the island at 16h30.Then our ticket back said 18h00, but our tour ended at 18h15, and we had to wait again in the sun for the boat, that arrived at 18h45, an then we waited for 15min more on the boat, for a small group that was on a private tour, so we were back in Cape Town after 20h. So, it took us almost twice the time they stated on their site, and that fact ruined some plans we had made based on the time they told us the tour would take."

I wondered if it would fail if sufficient force was applied. Coming back we were luck to go on a Cat as the fishing boat was full. It's much faster and overtook the boat which left before us. Buses on the island are very old but again original. Tour Guide didn't seem to recognise that two buses to the prison would not fit in one.

I was shocked to learn about Robert Sobukwe - until the tour, I'm ashamed to say I had never heard of him but can't quite understand why his name isn't as well known as Mandela's. It deserves to be.

We demanded that he give us his name as his conduct was reprehensible, malign and completely out of line. He confronted us in front of other ferry guests and proceeded to dismiss our attempts to settle the dispute amicably.

I can't deny the emotional impact of what we felt was a 'must do' trip, but it seems the organisers are doing their best to diminish the whole experience, not least in taking an hour longer than the advertised 3.5 hours. Ticket sale money certainly doesn't appear to be going into maintaining transport and facilities.We took advice from Trip Advisor, booked tickets in advance and arrived fairly early, and waited, and waited. Got almost to the front of the queue as they loaded the fast boat but couldn't get on. Maybe lucky - it was raining quite heavily and people clearly didn't want to sit outside on the boat, so it looked as if there were many standing inside. They must then have realised they'd need another boat, so the first one went off and we waited some more before getting the antiquated, slow and somewhat uncomfortable 'Susan Kruger' over half an hour late. At least we had seats inside.On the island we were herded into cramped and ancient buses for the first part of the tour. This was NOT led by ex-political prisoners, as advertised, though the young man did a fairly good job if you could hear him; many clearly couldn't. Seating in the bus meant it was difficult to see out properly or take photographs unless you were by a window. Then we were given a totally inadequate break for bathrooms and coffee, both with long queues. Luckily it had stopped raining by this time.The prison tour was lead by an ex-prisoner but with too large a group so, again, sometimes difficult to hear. This was, of course, the highlight of the tour and it was done fairly well.Then back onto the Susan Kruger for the slow trip back. Good views of Cape Town and Table Mountain as it was sunny by now, but no outside seating and no facilities on the boat (except pretty poor bathrooms)."

It also saves queuing. Below are the highlights of the tour:- Checkin at the waterfront museum and then 45min ferry across to the island with great views of the waterfront and Table Mountain- Transfer to a tour bus for a short drive past the main block then to the compound and story of Robert Sobukwe. - Next to the lime quarry and finally a quick stop for 10 mins to grab a snack.The guide on the bus is very informative and conveys the sad stories with emotion but does not let the mood get too gloomy with interjections of some lighter moments. - You are then dropped at the main prison where you are guided by an ex inmate who gave a very informative tour describing the conditions and you will get to see the cell used by Nelson Mandela. You are then left to walk back to the ferry port for the journey back to the waterfront. For me it was important to understand a bit more about the apartheid era and it was quite sobering at times but I would still highly recommend it."

It is a quiet place and if places hold memories then robben island is one. The second part of the tour is in the prison itself and our guide was a former inmates who had been held there for 7 years.

A very emotional experience.The 20 minute ferry ride over to the island and back was quite lovely - provided you are fortunate enough to get a seat topside, in the open air. The rest of the passengers below deck are all crammed together like a herd of cattle. I know. I was one of them on the return trip! But very doable.Once you arrive on the island, the is quite a bit of walking, even though most of the tour is done by bus. So walking to where you catch the buses - again, herd of cattle, first come first serve - is quite a distance. Then the return walk back to the ferry. The bus driver (some are former prisoners) takes you on a general tour of the island, pointing out and identifying various buildings and significant places of importance. With so many people packed on each of the many buses, the only way you can interact with the driver is to get a seat as close as possible to him. Which I managed to do. Not much stopping, so photo ops must be prepared for. Have your camera ready to go at all times. They do have one stop - bathroom/Snack food/smoke break. This is also where, if one is lucky, the famous little penguins are frolicking at the waters edge. Beautiful.The walking portion is also as a large group. Again, if you really are interested, stay as close to the guide as possible - without being rude or thoughtless of others in the process :). Touring the various prison quarter areas. It is at this part of the tour that the group, rank and file, walks by Nelson Mandela's prison cell. Fortunately for me, I was able to interact with our guide. He is a former prisoner of the island and was very open and honest with the information that he responded with, in response to our questions.Very glad that I went, but for reasons not mentioned (specifics not shared, so I don't ruin it for those yet to go) - I will not be returning.

The initial visit was the best, where you were allowed to stroll up to the prison and do the guided tour before the bus ride around the island. Now days it a rush from start to finish. You will need to book ahead to guarantee a place, and that is if the boats run. We booked one day, but had to reschedule due to the boat being repaired. The trip out to the island by boat is worth the visit as you see the wonderful views of Cape Town and Table Mountain, Bloubergstrand Beach etc. Along with encountering some of the local sea creatures, we saw penguins, seals and dolphins. The visit to the Prison is interesting, with your guide generally being an ex \"political prisoner\". Each appears to have his or her own opinion of the island, with different accounts each time we have visited. The best account is still Mandela's book so if read this you get a better view. It was humbling to see the cell and the stone cairn at the quarry, which reminds you of hardship the prisoners endured. although it can be said that it was not the worst of it's kind in the world at that time.The bus tour is rushed and the guide appears recite a well practiced narrative as you speed along. A lot of the early history of the island is \"skipped\" to focus on the \"prison years\", which is disappointing. As most things over the years the island has been left to deteriorate and many parts are in need of some maintenance and repair.Robben Island is worth the visit, but the expense and rushed nature of the tour dose not do it justice. It appears to have become just another commercial tourist attraction, rather than to preserve a part of South Africa's history."

However, the expedited boat to a bus to a guided walk through does not do it justice; and I felt more like cattle than a tourist. I could have skipped the bus tour and just read more (the 1 minute allocation was not enough) in the cell areas. They also seem to not be able to keep up with the demand. They had 3 boats (one normal and two charter), of very different levels of quality. They shoved more people on the big boat I was on than could sit, and diesel smell and loud noise made me nauseous. I was sitting on a piece of equipment, and ripped my shorts on a bolt. I am glad I went, but it is overpriced and not pleasant."

The sea was calm and the weather was good. This was a fantastic tour. We were fortunate in that we had two political prisoners as our guides. It really brought to mind the horror of apartheid and how brave the people were to fight it. It seems unbelievable that the apartheid system could have lasted so long. I was left with a number of feelings. I realised how lucky I am and I wondered whether we do enough to fight injustice in this world."

It is not often you get the chance to see history from your own lifetime and having an ex prisoner as your guide brings it to life."

Nothing interesting really. The tales of the prisoners are well, meek and mild compared to some other prisons around the world and certainly the prisoners there were treated extremely well, compared to prisoners in Communist jails. I mention communist as most of the prisoners at the time were and still are communists."

Having been advised to purchase tickets for the Robben Island tour well in advance (months), I expected this to be a highlight of our CT visit, but unfortunately I was left feeling quite disappointed. Once we arrived on the island, we were herded onto buses for the tour around the island. Try to be one of the first onto a bus as these are filled to the max, therefore if you are not sitting at the window, it can be challenging to take good pics. The bus tour lasts approx 1hr, with 2 stops. These are quite brief (10 mins) and visitors herded back on the buses again. Following the bus tour, visitors are taken on a walking tour of one of the buildings. Former prisoners make this for an authentic experience, however the tour can lack professionalism. If not at the front (of the bus/walking tour) it can be challenging to hear. Again, the walking tour is quite timed. The guide's parting words are not to straggle and watch penguins on the way out, as many visitors miss boat back to CT. On the way back to the boat, there are quite a few display boards and gift shop, but given the guide's words and the tanoid call of waiting boats, I felt quite hurried to depart. I had no time for either and left feeling that I had not truly gleaned insight into this important element of SA history. However, I am also left wondering...if one arrives early enough in the day on the island, is it possible to take one's time at the end of the tour and take a later boat back to CT?"

It felt a little too touristy and some of the emotional depths of the trip were lost because of it.The guide did have lots of useful information, was easy to understand and gave the tour an added edge since they were former inmates.It's worth doing for the historical perspective, but perhaps it can be skipped if you don't have much time in Cape Town."

Worth the trip (if you're South African I'd even say it's required), but I was disappointed by the way the tours are conducted though not by the overall experience or the importance and significance of the museum. Book in advance! Ferry rides to and from the island are pleasant on fine summer days though the ride took much longer than I expected (over an hour). On arrival, you're immediately ushered to the buses, leaving no time to study the info boards. If you think you can do that on the way back, think again. Tours are rushed and even then ours was 45-60 minutes behind schedule. The buses aren't designed for sight-seeing and photographic opportunities are awkward if not altogether non-existent. The tour guide, however, was concise and engaging. The information on conservation and the fauna and flora was good and I was surprised to see what look like reindeer on the island (they're actually fallow deer). While most people come to view the prison and Nelson Mandela's cell, the museum might consider hosting guided walks for small groups around the rest of the island which has a surprisingly interesting history apart from the Apartheid years. Breaking the tours up into smaller groups in general is a good idea, though given the budget woes of the museum and its poor management I can see how this is currently impractical. Our prison tour guide, a former political prisoner on the island between 1977 and 1982, was awesome and inspiring. He was passionate about sharing his experiences during incarceration despite the unjust circumstances and also eager to share with everyone the wisdom he and others gained. Although unclear at times, his enthusiasm was undeniable and I appreciated this aspect of the tour most."

I consider it a shame that I must submit this review, but I feel my fellow travelers must be made aware of a situation they may encounter: The only way to get to Robben Island is by boat, which is owned by the \"Nelson Mandela Foundation\". The boat is the \"Susan Kruger\", and it is a very old boat. As a matter of fact, I am told that it was this boat that transported prison personal and prisoners to Robben Island in the old, bad days. They have refitted the interior of the boat to make it somewhat habitable by tourists - minimally habitable at best. The waters between Cape Town and Robben Island can get very, very rough, and the boat itself is by no means built for rough water. On the day we sailed in her, January 5, 2015, the water was quite rough, causing the boat to pitch and roll excessively, with the result that over half the passengers got seasick. There was also a sea fog, which is also common to this area. After about 30 minutes, the ship's radar went out, and, for some unknown reason, the boat seemed to \"wander around\", apparently looking for Robben Island. We were later told that, because of reefs in the area, the captain was unable or unwilling to proceed, and could not get the radar to function. He finally came across a boat that was heading to the Island, and followed the boat in. So, a 40 minute trip that started at 9 AM arrived at the Island at 11:15 AM, with most of the passengers seasick. We were then told they would have to send for an expert from the mainland to try to fix the radar, as the boat could not return without it! The company finally had to charter two other boats to bring people back and forth to the Island. The boats chartered were modern, state of the art Catamarans, which got us back to Cape Town, in luxury, in 30 minutes! Speaking to our local tour guide, we learned that what happened to us, and the \"Susan Kruger\" that day, appears to be the rule, rather than the exception, and the charter companies that operate the Catamarans are very often chartered by the Foundation, to fulfill their tourist commitments. The tour of Robben Island, is one of the main tourist attractions of Cape Town, for good reason. Daily, hundreds and hundreds of people visit the island, producing significant income to the Nelson Mandela Foundation - very significant income. Why they continue to operate an old vessel, which has definitely long ago seen its best days, is a serious question that should be investigated by the proper authorities. So, here is my warning to my fellow travelers: if the weather forecast calls for heavy sea swells, AND the Foundation is using the \"Susan Kruger\", you might want to think twice, or be prepared for an \"E Ticket experience\"."

The last time it looked really run down compared to earlier visits & you weren't even allowed into Mandela's cell or the mine anymore. I had a 3 month old baby with me. There were no facilities for him, nor anyone who would require wheelchair access. The information given on the tour was vague & almost appeared to be more for foreign tourists. On arrival, I watched in horror as staff lifted my baby strapped into his pram over the side of the boat and about a meter and a half of water to dry land because there was no buggy or wheelchair access. Where is there health and safety? The boat was old, over crowed and the staff were rude. The boat on the way back was nicer, but not buggy or wheelchair friendly. Taking into account that I had to pay half the price of an adult ticket for a 3 month old baby, it was not worth the money spent. There are documentaries that show you far more than the tour did and they were done before the place became completely run down."

As a teenage student growing up in apartheid South Africa, opposing a regime that was running a police state, I felt an affiliation with Robben Island's most famous prisoner, and one of the most iconic men in all of history, Nelson Mandela (Madiba and Tata to his followers).Great trip on the ferry, but take a light jacket or sweatshirt. There's a bar on the ferry too, and it's only a short 40 minutes cruise.Once you're on the island you'll be flooded with emotion! Some serious history and many sacrifices on that famous island. Take the kids, they'll love it.Ps. Book well in advance ... like a month!"

Our guide on the bus was Wendy, who gave a beautifully clear explanation of the main landmarks. A real bonus was that Christo Brand, author of Mandela - My Prisoner & My Friend, came on to the bus to tell us his story - very emotional! We then toured the prison with a former political prisoner who told it as it was . . . He explained that telling his story to groups like us is therapeutic for him.This is a tour not to be missed and worth booking in advance to ensure a place."

Once on island you are provided a tour of the island by bus then are escorted into the prison facility by an ex prisoner who will describe in detail what conditions were like when Robben Island was a full functioning prison. Ask a lot of questions because they have a lot to tell. It is very very solemn but at the same time interesting and an important part of history. I am currently reading Nelson Mandela's \"Long Walk to Freedom\" and have also been inspired to read another Robben Island political prisoner of lesser fame, Robert Sobukwe's biography \"How Can Man Die Better.\" This tour is a must do.

Also be careful that there is a return journey and it is on time when booking your tour.

The guides are former prisoners who have a excellent knowledge, first hand, of the prison conditions. Visitors talking on their cell phones during the presentations were not appreciated by our group.

Although the wait was a bit long (we arrived there early) and the lady checking us in, had to trouble typing in the booking numbers. We set out to the island on the Tigger 2 boat and although the sea was a bit choppy the 45 minutes ride was comfortable. The visit of Robben island by bus with the tour guide and of the prison with the ex-prisoner was an experience not to be missed. It was an enlightening, informative, and emotional visit for all of us. Laws like the Sobukwe law are things never to be repeated again.The only bad review that we have on the trip is on transfer back from Robben island to Cape Town. We boarded the Sea Princess and the crew were in an unwelcoming party mode. They played loud club music, passed on silly jokes, invited people to drink alcohol. The captain ensured that he made our ride as uncomfortable as possible by charging the waves, while the crew thought it was funny. They even asked the crew if they were feeling sick and could offer a sick bag. After such an emotional and touching experience on Robben island that type of behaviour on the Sea Princess was totally unacceptable. It was an insult to the memory of Robben Island.The trip is an experience recommended to all, young and old. Hope that the behaviour of the crew of the Sea Princess improves, since it could mess up the whole experience for some visitors."

As we had been cautioned by some people to be timely, we were on the queue to enter the boat by 8.30 a.m. and the boat left by 8.45 a.m.! The journey across the sea was a bit rough and lasted about 45 minutes. The tour on the island itself was very interesting, especially since our guide in the prison itself was a former political prisoner who was able to narrate that time in vivid colours. The whole place was sparkling which I should think was not like that during Mandela incarceration. The original state of the cells should have been kept - at least in some parts of the prison as is being done in the former concentration camps in Germany to convey the horrors of the past."

The boat ride (on an original diesel boat that ferried previous prisoners to and from the island) from Cape Town was approximately one hour in each direction because of choppy waters. Upon arrival, we took a 45 minute bus tour of the island, which was most recently used to house political prisoners. We were told about the islands history and viewed various landmarks including the kennel, lepers burial ground, church, school, medical center and others. Although the buildings are currently in a state of disrepair, we were told that restoration is forthcoming. We were then went on to the actual prison area that house Nelson Mandela among other prisoners. The thing that made this part of the trip interesting is that all of the guides in this aspect of the trip are actually previously politically imprisoned South Africans that served time on Robbens Island.

He added the personal touch with his little anecdotes. The coach takes you around the whole island which is really eerie and sets the scene for going into the prison.When you go into the prison you are taken round by a former prisoner. Listening to his story was so moving and many of us were in tears. It was a truly amazing experience. We also got to see Nelson Mandela's cell.

For such an essential part of South African history, the Robben Island tour is something of a mixed bag of highs and lows. At the same time, you would be at a loss if you didn\u2019t take the R 150 tour since it really does retrace a time in that country\u2019s history that cannot be forgotten. Nelson Mandela spent twenty years on the island where the government imprisoned whom they deemed the most dangerous anti-apartheid agitators even when their crimes were minor. The prison was built in 1961, and Mandela started his sentence just two years later. Prisoners were allowed to write only two letters a year to the outside world and subject to brutal conditions including starvation, solitary and back-breaking labor in a quarry.You see all this once you get to the island 12 km from the V&A Waterfront in Cape Town, but there is, of course, the boat ride there, which takes a little over half an hour. It\u2019s a bumpy ride on some fairly choppy waters on an aged ferry where you will likely get drenched at certain points. If you are subject to seasickness, I strongly suggest you take some dramamine at least a day in advance. Once you arrive, you follow the hordes all of whom are targeting to get on one of the waiting buses. The buses are packed quite tightly, and you are stuck on it for about 45 minutes of narrative around the island. In reality, there is very little to see of interest with perhaps a long shot of Table Mountain the only real photo opportunity. Even the quarry is at a distance when the driver stops, and we could see little of it from our seats.The tour improves immeasurably once we arrived at the prison where we were met by an ex-political prisoner who spoke passionately about his time as an inmate. Even though our group was large, he spoke loudly and eloquently about what life was like as you go through the prison, the exercise yard and most movingly, walk past the small cell where Mandela was incarcerated where all you see is some blankets and a stool. When the tour is over, we basically had to hike back to the dock at a quick pace to make sure we weren\u2019t left behind. There was no time for the museum shop, and in hindsight, I wish the organizers provided more guidance to help manage our expectations. An introductory film would also have been helpful or at least something to provide greater context for what we were about to see."

The typical tourist gets on a boat, travels to the island, takes a short bus ride with a guide, walks around on foot and gets the boat back.The more serious tourist spends time before the start, at the departure point, reading some of the prisoner comments and histories.They ask the guide questions. Usually guides are ex prisoners. Ask about their motivation and you will be taken into a new world reserved for the few.My family were prison guards, what we did to some residents was terrible. The day prisoners arrived, they received a number and for the rest of their stay they were never again referred to by their names, only their numbers.Read the individual stories on the cell doors. Again, ask questions.I find any return to the island to be a very special time. special because it reminds me of our inhumanity towards each other. Ours is not the only country that is inhumane, but perhaps one of the few who has come clean, and allowed others to see a face that is shocking.So, whether you want a light tour, see Nelson Mandela's cell, go and have fun. And if you want to understand how special he was as a person, ask questions and see how much he had to overcome."

The guided tour by a former political prisoner of the cell block that Mandela was held in is sobering. The ride over on the ferry took 45 minutes. When it came time to leave they had brought in a catamaran to take people back to Cape Town. We knew that the ferry had not left Cape Town yet to pick people up from Robben Island so we thought we we would get back faster. That was not the case! It took 1 1/2 hours for the catamaran to get us back to the waterfront. In the meantime, the ferry passed us on the way to Robben Island, picked up the passengers and then passed us again to get back to the waterfront ahead of us. Be forewarned- unless you WANT a sailboat ride, wait for the ferry! I would have given this venue an excellent if not for that."

Some walked aimlessly, others squeezed into a nearby bus. After sitting in the bus for 15 minutes, the bus left, went 50 metres around the corner and told us to disembark. Then the tour guide arrived. He was an ex Soweto internee, but even allowing for this, I was very disappointed: I only understood perhaps 5% of what he said. What he did say was obvious and not informative at all. Further, the group following him must have been about 60 people. The 2nd guide a few hours later was better. But overall, considering that we had travelled 6,000 miles and expected this to be one of the highlights of our trip, was terrible. I suggest that they organise people better, perhaps have an audio guide also."

We got the bad one on our 50 minute boat ride to Robben Island. Once we got there, we found out there weren't enough buses for everyone, so they split us into 2 groups. Group A went on the buses & did an island tour first, Group B would do the prison tour first then do the island tour later.We were in the group to do the prison tour first. We got put in a group with about 30 Belgium travelers who had a private translator. This was awful. Everything our guide said, we had to wait for the private group's translator to translate to Dutch. As a result, we only got to see half as much as others since everything had to be said twice. We (the 10 or so non-Dutch people on the tour) that it wasn't fair. The tour specified it would be done in only English, and we were denied half of the tour because of the time it took to translate to Dutch. Then, at one point, the private Dutch translator actually yelled at our guide that we \"need to move on\" because his people didn't want to wait for the English version of the tour. Hello! The tour was said to be in English, not our problem the Dutch booked it and cannot understand it! The Dutch tourists would yell back and forth to each other while the English was being said, so even when English was being spoken, we couldn't hear it due to the private tour people. When we complained about this and said we wanted to tour again, they said that'd be a private tour & cost extra. Well, why did the Dutch essentially get a private tour with their translator they brought, which infringed upon our time there?So after this half-assed tour, we decided we didn't want to get on the bus and have another half-trip, so we jumped in with another group and did the prison tour again, this time in English. We literally saw twice as much & were told twice as much. This guide was excellent.So all in all, we were annoyed. We only did 1/2 of the tour, and did it twice. The first time was awful because of awful guests & because the tour operators allowed for this private translator to take up half of the time. At least on the ride back to Cape Town we got on the good boat, and saw whales & dolphins."

Sure it was nice, indeed it was a privilege to have a former inmate talk to us about some of his experiences there, but it didn't tell us the whole story or anything like. Arriving on the Island we were herded onto buses and then each bus load became a single tour group taken round a very limited number of locations. Then we were herded back onto the buses for the boat trip back.There is a real opportunity here to use the prison buildings as a museum where people are free to browse exhibits and read documents at their own pace. I felt the film \"Long Walk to Freedom\" gave some fascinating insights about how Mandela and others used their time on the Island to nibble away at the oppressive regime and maintain their struggle and their dignity. There were only hints at this on the trip. The overall impression was that I was glad to have seen where the political prisoners were incarcerated but I really didn't learn anything new."

Robben Island helped fill in this part of the picture for us of the history of South Africa from settlement by the Boers and then the British and their respective impact on the indigenous population and the descent into the horrors of the apartheid system. It was shocking to learn that the system was applied in prison with black prisoners given a smaller food allowance than coloured and white prisoners. It was very moving to see Nelson Mandela's cell and more generally to be guided by an ex inmate who served 5 years for his political views. There is some truth in some of the earlier reviews posted on this site's criticism of the organisation of the trip. Loading the buses was a bit of a scrum and the groups were quite large for the tour and not helped by inattention and chattering by some tourists when the guide was explaining things. However, the number of people wanting to do this tour is so big that it is inevitable that to allow everyone a chance to go the groups have to be larger than desirable. The criticism of the boat trip is unfair as on a nice sunny day it was pleasant to motor across with lovely views back into Cape Town and Table Mountain with seabirds and the occasional dolphin. One boat was faster than the other so we did speed back but that was just luck. The organisers could look at how they embark and disembark people on the boats and buses and ensuring visitors get the best out of the trip whilst on the island and catching a returning boat. We pre-booked our tour before leaving the UK and I would recommend this to avoid disappointment. An early morning departure does enable a return to Cape Town for lunch and or afternoon exploring."

If you intend to visit take the 9.00am departure so that you can at least have the afternoon in Cape Town. While the ferry ride was long we did see two whales breaching, several seals and a penguin!"

It took and hour to get there by boat and you were ushered to a bus where 2 buses set off immediately, our bus had to wait for people to come and fill it up before we could leave, about 15 minutes wait. The chap on the bus was very good and knowledgeable, we were then told to get off the bus at the prison where a former inmate would meet us and take us around the prison. This he did but I felt the we were not given enough time to see around the prison and read about the people who were incarcerated there. The cell of Mandela was shown to us and we were told to leave by the front exit. I would like to have gone back to see what I had missed in the first part of the prison but I was not offered the opportunity. We were not informed of the time of the boats and there were no facilities to queue up for the next boat. We were grouped en masse at the quay and when the next boat arrived everyone rushed forward to get on it almost knocking elderly and disabled people flying! The boat could only take so many so we had to wait for the next boat, if I knew I would have to wait so long I could have spent more time at the prison. Someone was telling arrivals where to go but it would have been helpful if someone was explaining to the people waiting to leave what was going on. I felt it was very badly planned and it spoiled my whole experience."

Also, we were supposed to return at 2 pm on the \"nauticat\" - which seems to have been booked on short notice (?) for a private function resulting in a delay of over half an hour.

We were on the Nauticat which didn't seem as old as some of the other boats reviewed but it still took 40+ minutes to get to the island. I agree with other reviewers that there was little organization/direction - we arrived and you just wandered to either the store, restrooms and eventually to the waiting buses at the end of the dock and had to ask which one to get on. I was happy that we did the walking tour of the prison first and then drove around the island. I felt we had more time to hear the guide (an ex-prisoner \"Sparks\") and to tour the area on foot which was better than the bus ride portion. Afterwards there were two boats to take us back and ours filled up so we took the catamaran which was even slower than the boat over. The ride back was entertaining as we had a large group of local women on our tour and they started an impromptu sing along (in Africaans?) and dance among themselves that lasted almost the entire ride back. A lot of it featured Mandela's name and it made the ride back quite enjoyable."

I felt like were treated as a big herd of buffalo's that just had to be moved around until we could be sent back.Everything was rushed through - we didn't have time to read all the small stories in the cells, and it felt very crowded all the time. Our guide, a former inmate, had good intentions in speaking loud and clear, but it came out so slow and awkward that I almost felt asleep.I had hoped it would be like visiting Alcatraz - maybe even better due to the possibility to teach us all more about the apartheid.I would have loved to have walked around the prison at my own pace - with headphones explaining the things our guide tried to tell us. And if busses for the short island tour were just cruising around all the time, I could have decided if I wanted to do that part as well - or just spent more time inside the prison (where I imagine a museum-kind of style with apartheid stuff), and then just take a boat back whenever I were ready for that (if they sailed on a regular schedule).Maybe my expectations were just way off - I had really hoped for some more - instead I now think of the visit like this\"walk around...watch out not to step on other people in the small space....go into a cell, have a look...get out again....here is Mandelas cell....hurry...move on to the outside....get in the bus....get out again....go back to the ferry\"It wasn't worth the money or time - the best part was the view of Cape Town from the ferry."

I visited Robben Island on the last day of my two week stay in South Africa in August (2014) and have to say I regretted the loss of 5 hours from my holiday. This was a guided tour that to me was so haphazardly organised and rushed it was laughable. We (myself and my newly found German friend Alex) actually did crack up laughing at the shambolic nature of the trip - it was either that or be annoyed but the former seemed more appropriate.  The outside of the Nelson Mandela Gateway departure building is modern and quite impressive.Having got our tickets a couple of days earlier - highly recommended if you do decide to go as bookings do fill up in advance - we waited the stipulated 45 minutes in the departure area (1 bench available for 170-odd passengers) thinking the boat would be on the quay outside. Not a bit of it. After going through the security check points we were ushered outside and then on a 10 minute walk back through the Waterfront part of town to the waiting boat. Although the boat had historical interest and relevance - it carried the original convicts of Mandela's era over to the Island it just wasn't up to modern tourist standards. I believe it took 169 passengers. Well there couldn't have been seating for a third of that number which I think raises a serious question of safety. Added to that there was an awful lot of mooring rope and chains lying about and the boat being in very rusty condition it left a lot to be desired. Once arrived at the Island there was no time to stop and look round the shop. We were directed straight onto two large multi-doored buses for an around the Island bus tour. This probably for us was the most interesting part of the trip as the on board tour guide was a former prisoner of the prison in Mandela's time and gave a good resume of the uprising that resulted in the prison being built used for Mandela and his co-captives. But even this seemed rushed. The bus didn't actually stop at any of the places of interest until we got to Mandela's cell block. We did stop halfway round at a cafe for TEN MINUTES barely enough time to queue for take out snacks and go to the toilet let alone soak up the amazing view of Table Mountain. By the time we got to Mandela's cell block incredibly our 2nd tour guide said we were running considerably behind schedule!! Where we lost that time I don't know! Before entering the block he pointed out the direction for the quay and the boat back to Cape Town. Then the new guide proceeded to spend 15-20 minutes repeating most of what the previous guide had said! With huddles of the party blocking the doorway view of Mandela's cell we didn't even get to stop, look and ponder (well we COULD of but we would have missed the boat back - more on that).So I just raised my camera over the heads of those hogging the cell doorway and clicked - luckily it came out quite well. On leaving the block we understood why the guide told us before where to walk to the Island's quaint harbour because there was no sign of any guides! When we got to the quay there was no sign of the boat that brought us either!  A large sailed and motored catamaran was there and we were directed to board this. After passing a sign that arrowed shop this way that actually pointed into the harbour, we boarded our boat back. What the boat over lacked in comfort, this boat lacked in capacity! It seated probably 30-35 people with others sitting on the webbing between the hulls and left us wondering if the other 100 or so people who came over had realised there was so little time or even how they were getting back. Anyway, we made our way onto the webbing on the front of the boat and soaked up the sun and view back to Table Mountain which we agreed was the best part of the trip! Part of my angst was knowing that my hired package holiday's driver was waiting for us at Cape Town from 2pm when we were told the boat would return. In fact it left Robben Island at about then so we didn't get back until gone three (where my driver loyally waited) - the catamaran didn't go as fast as it could of (safety reasons no doubt). What was most disappointing about the trip was we didn't really get the time even to pause and soak in that moment/event in history. There was definitely a massive shortage of time over the whole tour - you really felt it was a conveyor belt style attraction. Had we had the time and KNOW we could get a later boat back it would have been a lot better. As far as value for money goes it wasn't too expensive - under \u00a320 for the whole tour including return boat trip but then how do you weigh up value against dissatisfaction? Had the Island not had such great historical significance I would have begrudgingly given this attraction ONE star but given that famous part of 20th Century history and the icon that Mandela is I would still say visit - just be prepared for the above."

What made it even more memorable and poignant was that I did it on Robben Island. I've lived here for over 20 years, but I've never taken the 45 minute ferry over to see this extraordinary place. This is my year of being a tourist in my own city,( I am extending that to next year too) and so when I heard that there was a race being held on the island I jumped at the chance to go. We took the ferry out at 6am in the morning - they run all day and are fast and efficient. Saw plenty of dolohins and seals en route as well which was really cool. The closer we got the the island the more magnificent Cape Town looked as the backdrop. Honestly, we live in the most beautiful city. I often imagine what the first explorers must have thought when they arrived in Table Bay. It must have been an astounding feeling. It still is today for me. For the triathlon - a mini sprint- I swam in the harbour, cycled around half of the island and ran through the prison and the staff quarters. When you are moving through a place like this- be it running or cycling, the experience takes on a different perception: I felt the beauty of the island, yet also was acutely aware of the solitariness of it all and that many people have spent years incarcarated there. Yet there is a strong feeling of freedom as well. As a local, I felt sadness as well as joy for all that we have gone though as a country. You have to go and feel it for yourself."

The most intriguing part was that the tour guide was ex political prisoner that had spent 6 years there with Nelson Mandela!"

Except for the final stop at the gaol, we were bussed around everywhere - how about a set of headphones so people can walk the short distances from site to site themselves to get the real feel of the place. It was great to have a former inmate as a tour guide in the gaol itself, although there were far too many people in our group, jammed into a narrow dark corridor, and very few could hear him. He also probably needed some basic presentation skills to help hold the attention of the audience. Final thought - could there be a better, faster ferry? The trip across the rough water was pretty awful with some sick people on the return journey. Final final thought - because we were given no deadline to climb back aboard the boat, some people took forever wandering back from the gaol and idling around in the shop while everyone else was waiting. The whole tour took five hours - including the boat ride - it felt too long - lots of hanging around."

The sea was choppy and the boat made 50% of people sick - although not to blame on the organiser I feel it's important to mention.The actual visit was well managed - once on the island one is greeted by a guide, in our case an ex-convict. He shows around and explains briefly about the prison, the prisoners and life in the prison. I guess it took 1 hour and of course a few references to Nelson Mandela - but don't expect it to be centred around him (which we had expected).The 2nd part of the experience is a bus tour of the east and south side, incl. the village and a number of noteworthy locations. Not too long neither, just right.If you have 3-4 days make Robben a part of your visit to Cape Town. If you only have a weekend don't. In total the visit lasts 4 hours (it took as 45 min to get through security and board the vessels) and the sailing time is 30-45 min each way."

At first glance this barren piece of scrubby island with small buildings one would not expect to be a major attraction. Add in its political historical context as the incarceration site of South African black activists in the 1960's , particularly Nelson Mandela , and this has become something of a pilgrimage site. It is not as spectacular to see as Alcatraz or the Chateau d'If but has strong historical interest.Since ca 1994 it has been a heritage site museum for the politicos held under the Apartheid regime.We had booked our tour from the UK and the morning was taken up with a visit to the District 6 museum and the Langa township.You can just book a Robben island trip directly at the waterfront area.Suggest you book ahead as demand is high and there is limited space on these old ferries..For the afternoon our guide handed us our tickets for the ferry ( an old convict ship the Suzy Kruger) and we travelled over ( ca 45minutes) to the island and straight onto buses which took us round the island with guided commentary of the islands history , comments on the Prison buildings , the limestone quarries ( hard labour) and a village where ex prisoners and some ex guardes live together now , and some wildlife can be noted on this tour. There are some spectacular views back to Cape Town during the tripOnto a pedestrian tour round the individual prisons , with an ex political prisoner (Ntando Mbatha) as a guide describing his experiences and those of other prisoners.I found this guy very knowledgable and sympathetic .Most political prisoners were imprisoned on a generic charge of \"Sabotage\" - usually being a member of the ANC or other banned organisations , breaches of the \"Dompass \" laws , or simply being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Certainly travelling outside of SA without approval attracted prison incarceration.Whilst some may think that the Nelson Mandela cell was bleak and featureless - that is the nature of prisons.There is also an area where penguins can be seen but the timing of the tour ( to get back on the return ship to CapeTown) does put one under some pressure. No sign of the seasls which gave the island its name Robben , from the Afrikaans.So , not for everyone , my wife and I enjoyed it as \" an experience\" .Would however recommendit to anyone who wanted a historical context to the Apartheid regime and its passing."

After a short boat trip from Cape Town (great views if you are not clinging on to avoid being blown over the side) you arrive at the harbour and then the bus trip starts. Make sure you sit on the left hand side of the bus as that is where you will be able to see the quarry and the cave. I would have preferred being allowed out of the bus to see some of the Mandela related sites rather than only being allowed out on the beach to look at the view of Table Mountain across the bay. The prison itself is very moving especially as the guides are former prisoners so are able to give a real first hand account of life in the prison. Be sure to read the accounts printed on the walls of the cells, some real insights into what the prisoners experienced."

After going thru a security scan and metal detector we are moved into a holding pen where we think we are waiting for the ferry boat. For some unknown reason they then herd us all across the waterfront area and split the group between two private tour boats. No explaination was offered if this was normal or not. After a 45 min ride in fairly rough seas we arrive at the island. It\u2019s much bigger than expected. A bus tour takes you around the island \u2013 to the farthest point where there\u2019s a lighthouse and beautiful view of Cape Town. The bus tour ends at the maximum security prison for a walking tour of this section. Our tour guide is an ex-inmate. He explains life in the prison, we see his cell and the cell of Nelson Mandela. Also visit other locations within the prison. The boat ride back to Cape Town is in VERY rough seas. Rough seas are common so be prepared. The boat seems overcrowed and I'm uneasy it can accommodate this many people and the high waves. (In the US boats would not sail in these conditions.) We make it back safe but it was a scary boat ride for many people that day."

On arrival chaos resumed as nobody was around to tell us where to go and it was generally follow someone else that led us to board some overcrowded coaches. Coach journey round island was uncomfortable and tedious to say the least. The visit to the prison was the only part with any interest . Had been told this is one of the things you must do in south Africa but were very disappointed as were other people we spoke to. Give it a miss."

You can read about Robben Island all you want, but being there to see the facilities and the quarry and to listen to the primary testimony of a political prisoner will shed a whole new light on your knowledge of the situation. I would warn you to get these tickets weeks in advance. Also be prepared to have your trip canceled due to wind or weather conditions. They will give a full refund.Another caution is the trip. We were in an old boat, the Susan Kruger, and half the people looked sick going and coming due to the huge waves. Take some Bonine before you go.When you arrive, you board a bus with a local resident who explains the town and what the buildings are used for now as he also explains some of the history of the prisoners. You will then meet with a former political prisoner in an area of the prison who describes the untenable conditions and treatment, Many people, including myself, did not know that people suffering from mental illness and leprosy were also imprisoned here. Made me think of the Nazis.Will history ever stop repeating itself?"

We were booked on the 11am and luckily checked what time we had to be there (10.20am) as had we been later we would have missed the boat as it left at around 10.40am.The ferry over was nice and comfortable and on the way we were lucky enough to see a Southern Right whale, a dolphin and a seal! On arrival you get loaded onto a coach and drive round the island for a while being told about the history. You also make a quick stop at a shop if you want some food or need the toilet. Our guide was Kent and he was really knowledgeable and entertaining. If you enjoy this then make sure you give them a small tip.We then went into the prison and were taken round by an ex-prisoner. We were able to spend enough time looking round before then walking back to the dock. We thought this was a really interesting trip with the right amount of time to cover everything you needed and I would definitely recommend it."

At the scheduled departure time, we were told that the ferry was running ten minutes late and that the return ferry would be extended to take account of this. Half an hour after the scheduled departure time, the ferry docked and everybody disembarked. It was then announced that the ferry had been cancelled. The skipper had just decided. Mayhem then ensued as people asked about refunds and rescheduling. There was one person at the cash desk to refund the entire boatload of people. Very disappointing service. We can understand that bad weather happens but letting customers sit there for a precious hour knowing that the sailing won't happen is just cheap service and unforgivable.

Yes it is political but propaganda I don't think so or perhaps I had a moderate ex prisoner, I come from a country which also suffered years of violence and had it \"troubles\" and in Northern Ireland there are politicians who today compare themselves to those that suffered in Robben Island Max Security Prison well all I can say is they should hang their heads in shame no matter what they believed their cause was or how unjust their convictions they did not suffer anything remotely like that island.

Outside standing room only and it was a very hot day. Little problem with organization when we got to the Island. They were short of guides and so we were divided into very large groups and we visited the prison first. This part of the tour is quite short. At first a description of the prison by a former inmate, who is still very angry about the current situation in South Africa. Then we saw Mandela's cell. Then we had a bus tour of the island. The bus was quite full. Couples actually had to split up as there were not enough seats for them to sit together. We had a quick stop and when people asked how long before the bus would leave, the bus guide told us not to worry about the time as he would find all of us. The washrooms were limited and so most of the stop had been spent standing in line for both men and women.One couple had to chase the bus to catch it as we almost left without them. It was obvious that there were empty seats and so people that were missing. I guess the guide only was interested in finding the people standing outside, anxious to get back. There wasn't much else to see on the Island. The quarry where the prisoners worked and the Leper graveyard and that was about it.If it wasn't for the historical significance of Robben Island, we would have felt that it was a waste of a full morning of our vacation."

We all purchased our tickets online for about $30 USD, this includes the ferry ride to make it over to the island and your tour. https://www.webtickets.co.za/events/big-6/robben-island-museum-tour/76219. I suggest you get your tickets as soon as you know what day you'd like to visit. We wanted to go earlier in the week during our visit, but the days we wanted were sold out.Keep in mind that the ferry leaves the port at the time listed on your ticket! Give yourself plenty of time to get there and board. I would recommend 30-45 minutes prior to the departure time on your ticket. We did not do this and ended up having to run through the terminal and to the ship! They will let you know when you need to return to the boat for the return trip. As far as security goes prior to boarding the boat, it was not a big deal. You walk through a metal detector and they check your bag. The ride over to the island was not bad at all, but it was very choppy on the way back. It is a scenic ride though and if you sit outside you get beautiful views of table mountain.When we got to the island we walked over to the prison where we met our guide. All the guides there are former political prisoners. He shared his personal experience and knowledge of the prison with us while the group was seated in one of the cells (tour groups are about 30 people). I'd have to say this was my favorite part of the tour because it really brought things to life and made it personal. We then walked through the prison with our guide. After that portion of the tour we hopped on a bus and drove around the island with a guided tour from the bus driver. There is a stop during the bus tour for pictures, bathroom and snacks. I'm not sure if you can stick around the island and walk around after the bus tour and catch another ferry, but there is definitely plenty to explore if you're interested. Our group was pretty tired at that point, so we got back on the ferry.I high recommend this tour. It will give you a great perspective of South Africa's history and culture."

Robben Island and its history is priceless and well worth visiting.Unfortunately, the Department of Arts and Culture is doing a terrible job of managing the Island and its facilities. I took a group of 10 elderly American tourists. We waited in a long quee despite having bought online tickets, not enough seats for the elderly while waiting on ferry. Eventually we went through a strict security check, metal detectors and x-ray scanners for bags. The security guards asked each and every tourist/visitor including children if they had fire-arms/guns. Very valid question, but 5 minutes later we all walked out of the main building through the V&A Waterfront (about 800 metres) to a section of the Waterfront where private boats were moored, to board one of these private boats to ferry us to Robben Island. During the 7-10 minute walk without security, I could have obtained a fire-arm or explosives and nobody would have known. So security at the Robben Island Gateway, who are you fooling. It is a big joke and time consuming. My elderly guests did not appreciate the long walk to another part of the Waterfront to get on a boat. The \"new\" Robben Island ferry which cost millions of rands and with a lot of question marks around its purchase was on the dry dock for repairs and has been more out of the water than ferrying visitors to Robben Island since being purchased a few years ago.The experience to my guests on the island was good, the site guides around the island and at the old prison were good.The return was a disaster. They overbooked and when the last ferry left at 18h00, we were still around 60+ people who had to wait for a ferry to come from Cape Town. By then the south-easterly wind was blowing strong and the sea became rough. When the Susan Kruger (an old ferry) eventually arrived, we took more than double the time to return back to the City due to the rough seas and strong winds. Lots of local/international visitors got sea-sick. We eventually got back to the Gateway to Robben Island at 20H00, missing our dinner booking.To the management of Robben Island, thousands of tourists both local and international, come from all over the world to visit the island and Mr. Mandela's prison cell. You make millions of rand, please put the visitors first and not money. It is a disgrace. Your staff are all complaining and saying nothing ever gets done."

It is much more that Madiba as it is a still inhabited island originally used as a leper colony run by Irish Nuns. Being shown round the prison by an original inmate whose only crime appeared to be he was carrying a knife. A demonstration board for one prisoner sentenced to 18 years who went in on my 22nd birthday and came out the day before my 40th birthday - my main productive years - so the damage that the system did to the country was immense."

Booking this trip was the first thing I did upon our arrival in Cape Town and I was glad I did as I got the only available place that was left for the next few days so I would recommend booking prior to your arrival to ensure a place. The cost was 290R which is the equivalent to 20euro. Excellent excellent value for what was in store.We were on the first trip of the day at 9am and it was perfect timing for the day. The boat journey over is choppy and the breeze also picked up so ensure to bring a jumper! The journey took about 50minutes and overall we enjoyed it.On arrival to the island you are assigned a tour guide and we boarded a bus to begin our journey around the island. This place is steeped with history and is so well preserved, it is like having a flashback in time, nothing has changed and Robben Island is exactly how it was when Mr.Mandela served time there. I found the tour excellent, my only criticism is that we spent much of our time on the tour bus and I definitely think a few more stop offs along the way would further enhance the experience. I ended up taking a lot of photos through the bus windows!!! Stopping didn't seem to be an option. Our tour guide was good humoured also.Part of the tour was with an ex prisoner and he was amazing! He captured the attention of the audience and his story telling was very interesting. Overall I would highly recommend this trip, it is a must do and quite fairly priced. Go see where Mandela spent 18years of his life."

They could learn a bit from Kilmainham prison in Dublin, Ireland or even Constitution Hill in Joburg.As others sited, definitely get tickets in advance. I visited in mid-October and needed 2 days advance purchase for a weekday visit.The round trip boat ride was surprisingly great. Both ways, I was on a catamaran with 30? people. We had spectacular views, including a number of playful jumping dolphins and sunbathing seals along the way. Not sure how I lucked out with the catamaran (the main boat is much bigger) but..if you are in a rush, please note that the catamaran takes quite a bit longer than the main ship. I think it took us 45 minutes going and over 90 minutes returning.The tour, itself, was okay. It felt a bit too structured and hurried for my taste and the information shared was superficial and made the assumption that one already had all the needed background.Upon arrival, we were shuffled on to large busses. They then drove us around the island with almost an immediate 15 minute stop at a snack shop which seemed unnecessary. With the exception of Sobukwe's house and the lime quarry, most of the bus tour seemed optional but it wasn't optional. Also, I would have preferred if we could have gotten out of the bus at both the house and the quarry.After the bus portion, they transitioned us to the main prison. There, we met a former political prisoner who led us through cell block B. His story was heartbreaking and exactly why one comes to Robben Island. Mandela's cell was locked so one just takes a picture during a brief pause outside it.After the prison tour, we were sent on our way. There was no permission to wander about or ask questions. There was no allowance for looking at the photos on the way to the boat or stop into the gift shop. It felt very rushed..too rushed!I have been in South Africa for awhile now so I have a good amount of background on apartheid but I still think it would have been nice if the museum at the V&A had a film talking about apartheid, pass books, uprisings, why people went to jail, and some bios/video footage of prior inmates from Robben island. Maybe some of the material that is in the constitution hill museum (Joburg). I still think this is something every visitor to Capetown should do but I just hope they can optimize it for greater impact in the future."

A beautiful day and natural ocean goers, we enjoyed the crossing, while discussing the history and significance of this opportunity. Then we docked and this is when the disappointment set in..intentional? You decide...We were all crammed into a 60+ person bus and as mentioned if you didn't have a window you missed all the things of significance as the bus toured the island, past the guards residence and community, past the church and infirmary, past the quarry and then a 20 min. stop at a snack shop -we did not come here to eat! - and to photograph the mainland -again not why we were here. We finally arrived at a cell block, but the operator responsible for the island tours did not have a guide for us. Instead an inmate who had another group tried his best to give us a shortened briefing in 10 minutes where we then joined his group of 70 through to another cell block, were we were ushered past Mandelas cell and rushed out the other side so they could put us on the next ferry.Soooooo disappointing.

We got tickets on Saturday for the following Friday. Be prepared for about 2.5 hours on a boat - we had a beautiful day, but on the crossings (especially on return) we experienced a significant swell - enough to make some passengers uncomfortable. Take sun precautions as there is no shade at all if you end up on the top level.Don't expect to have the freedom to wander anywhere on Robben Island. You will leave the boat, only to be loaded onto a number of elderly buses where you will be greeted by your tour guide. The quality of your experience will depend largely on the enthusiasm and engagement of your guide. Most of the first hour you are unable to leave your bus, with viewing and photography being limited to what can be seen from the windows. There is a brief ten minute stop at the \"cafeteria\" where you can take some good shots of Table Mountain and Cape Town in the distance. The sense of desolation and isolation is palpable. You will then be passed on to your prison guide, who will be a previous detainee. What you see and hear is confronting - as you would expect. You will sit in a communal cell whilst you hear about the daily life of detainees. You will file past the isolation cells - tiny square boxes where Mandela spent about 18 years of his sentence! A fair amount of time will be spent waiting for previous groups to move on!From there you will walk back to the harbour, where there is the obligatory gift shop. Whilst there you have no idea how long it will be until the boat arrives to take you home. There is no orderly queuing for service, and when the boat turns up there is a general exodus to join a disorderly throng hoping to get aboard. Everyone surges forward only to be told to move back whilst the next mob of tourists disembark - on only one solitary gangway so this takes a while. Then everyone surges forward again! Crowd contol and communication are not strong-suits on this tour!Food and drink available for purchase are very limited. Alcohol is available on board the boats. We started our tour at 8.30 am and got back to V&A at 1.30 pm so taking a sandwich might be advisable, especially if you have kids with you.We were pleased with the level of professionalism on Table Mountain.

To hear and see the conditions they lived in was just heart wrenching. To hear first hand what it was like to be locked up there ... let's just say that the prisoners in our Australian jails ought not complain about their supposed \"poor\" conditions!

A heads up the day before was inconsiderate, esp. since we travelled 20 hours by plane to get here. - You could have saved us a lot of heachache by rescheduling our tour for us on the same day- Failing that, at least provide an international toll free number for overseas visitors (we didn't have a local SIM card). - We understand that unforseen circumstances do happen, but better customer service would have been appreciated."

It took us about 45 min to get to the island and about 1 hour to get back. It did feel a bit rushed because once you get to the island you immediately start the tour and when you're done with your, you immediately get back on the boat. Nonetheless, it was great listening to an ex prisoner give details about the prison. Price is about 300 rand aka $30 and its probably best to y tickets online ahead of time."

It would have been unthinkable to visit Cape Town and not take the ferry out to Robben Islandas a show of respect and solidarity for the struggle that continues to this day in this extraordinarily beautiful country. Our tour guide had been imprisoned in the late 70's as a high school student because of his Anti-Apartheid activities and was released years later as a young man. Both his passion and his ability to forgive was humbling. He now resides on the island full time in order to conduct these essential tours. I was moved to tears when I saw Nelson Mandela's cell and the courtyard garden where he hid his first manuscript in the dirt. It was full of blooming four o'clock flowers when we visited in early April. Not to be missed by anyone with a conscience."

Hi have read most of the previous review and mist of the comment read together give a very good overview of the trip to and from the island and the visit to the prison. Like most visitors to the island wasnt sure what to expect. Our group was only 40 in size and we had a great trip in the boat to and from but as other advisor s have said the bost will leave without you keep i eye out for your group members. On arrival on the island you are directed to buses at the end of the quay i did think a few signs at this point would have been helpful. But a wonderful drive around the island about 1 hr in lenght with a 10 min stop for the loo and a leg stretch. Then to the prison the guide an ex inmste gives a really insight to conditions during his stay which he gives during the wall around the cell area. Then the highlight cell 4 mandella s home for 18 years. Like other advisor reported a bit of mixex feelings about this part but a little tip stay at the back of your group plenty of time for extra pictures and you get a feel of yhe place being the last and only person in that cell area . Ok this could have been a little better but the history and importance of the place and the people who were there you HAVE to visit"

Given the story behind Robben Island it seemed to me to be a must visit during our week in Cape Town and I found it interesting but I'm not sure I enjoyed it.I had booked online before leaving Australia, a good idea because the tours are very popular and if we'd left it until the day we would have been disappointed I think.Boat trip - we were lucky to have a nice trip on the boat across to the island, the boat was in good order, the weather was exceptional so the trip was smooth, only issue would be that the boat was packed to the gunnels.Arrival on the island was smooth with everyone being mustered to waiting buses. Our guide on the bus was a very knowledgeable young man who spoke with a clear accent, something I welcomed as I did struggle with some of the deeper accents in Africa.Now, this is where we get to the bit where I had mixed feelings, I don't know if it's intentional but the whole tour was very regimented, you weren't allowed out of the bus much, a visit at the quarry and a leg stretch at the cafe for 15 minutes - it might be designed this way to make you feel like you are trapped and give you a feeling for how it might have been to be confined here, but that's how I felt. So many excellent photo opportunities and no way to take advantage of it because you are stuck on a bus. I would love to have been able to walk around the island to take some photos and soak up the environment and there might be a way to do this, but not on the tours.The tour of the cells was interesting with stories told by an ex inmate, but because there was a bus load of people trying to listen to his story was difficult unless you were up front.The end of the tour was very rushed as the ferry was about to leave, no time to visit the curio shop and send a postcard to yourself like it was suggested at the start of the tour.I'm glad I went on the tour, would i recommend it, I'm really not sure, as the heading says, mixed feelings!"

I don't understand where the money is going to for this as the boat is old & rusted, plus it is overcrowded. The boat ride took us 1 hour to get there from the v&a waterfront. Once we arrived we just got an old rusted bus...We did a 45 minute bus ride around the island, which was good to see & the guide was great. We were dropped to the maximum security prison with probably 100 others, The tour guide is an ex prisoner which was cool BUT we couldn't hear him, The tour group was far too big, he would often start talking before everyone could huddle in so you would miss information. He didn't have a microphone either so lots of people didn't hear his words. We got to see Nelson Mandela's cell, for 10 seconds before people pushing & shoving past trying to get a look in. I wasn't impressed at all with this tour & thought it was a waste of time & money. In total, it took us 1 hour to get there, 1 hour to get back, 2 hours to do the tour then we had to wait in the dark for 1 hour for the boat to arrive as it was late. I wouldn't recommend anyone to do this unless they really are passionate about the history of the island. My recommendation would be to visit the Aparteid museum in Johannesburg & Nelson Mandela's home in Soweto as these were far better & more valuable than robben island. Besides, I could have spent a whole day in the Aparteid museum, it is AMAZING!! Robben Island on the other hand was a let down....The following day, we went on a different tour & were talking to others from England & America (all different ages & sexes), who all had the same opinion as me. They also said they wouldn't recommend anyone to go."

Very interesting personal story from your respective guide.

Apparently we were met by a guide, but no bus was available...we then walked towards the prison and the guide had absolutely no clue what was going on and when and where we would get a bus to take us around the island.

The tour groups were just too big. The buses aren't really designed for tour groups. Smaller groups, different buses and more stops along the way would be better.

            "review": "A living piece of SA history. Visiting Robben island is a must for anyone that is interested in and has knowledge of contemporary South African history. It was very informative and the tour guides explained the history of Robben Island from its first use as a prison way back in early colonial times,to its use as a leper colony and finally to its more recent use as a prison for political prisoners. After a 45 minute boat ride to the island we were taken by bus around to see Robert Sobukwe's house where he was a 'guest' of the govt and then to the lime quarry where prisoners had to quarry lime. Our guide on the bus was informative but unfortunately gave a very biased narrative of South Africa's political history and never really challenged the current state of affairs in the country whch is clearly not what the prisoners here had fought for - whilst attempting to justify current discriminatory policies in South Africa. The fate of rural Transkei areas was mentioned to justify her view.Taking the tour inside the prison itself was interesting and we were toured by someone who experienced the prison personally. It was very interesting to see the cells and interact with former prisoners.One of Mandela's warders still works on the island and it was great to speak with him and ask him about his experiences and interactions with Mandela.The tour is not cheap at R250 per adult but it is worthwhile and even better if you read up on it before your journey. Go for a meal at the V&A waterfront after to top off a great day of touring."

While our tickets were booked in advance and we were scheduled to leave for the island at 1pm, we queued for 1 extra hour at the museum entrance and only departed at 2:30pm after getting walked to the boat which was moored 10 mins away from the security gates. None bothered explaining the reason behind the delay or apologizing for it. Once we got to the island eventually around 3:30pm, the former prisoner who showed us around and described his personal experience of living on Robben Island was really amazing. It is painful to realize that our children may not be able to experience meeting such person themselves and his story may no longer be available for future generations. Following on from this touching experience, we were crammed onto a bus and driven around while a \"guide\" dreadfully gave a very quick learned off speech about the story of the island. We were then packed off to the boat within 30 minutes of getting on the bus and headed back to Cape Town. The contrast between the 2 guides was palpable. It is a disgrace to Madiba's and all the other prisoners' memories that such a poorly organised tour exists. This company needs competition ASAP."

The tour guide was an ex-prisoner and he was very knowledgeable. However, we were extremely rushed and literally had 20 seconds to get a photo of Mandela's cell. I felt that there should be more to the tour, maybe more Mandela photos / quotes. An audio tour or some video clips would have made the tour more interesting. Overall, I was a little disappointed.

When you get there you get on a bus and drive around the island first, seeing the different prison sections and having stuff explained by a guide. When you get off into the main prison building a guide comes to you and starts to talk about the prison's history. The cool thing is that all the guides are ex prisoners of the island, so they have their own stories to tell which is very interesting. We saw Nelson Mandela's cell and the prison block where all the political prisoners were kept. It was a really great experience and should not be missed when visiting Cape Town in my opinion.

The day turned out as forecasted - beautifully calm and sunny, however all tours have been cancelled (we had 1pm tickets). We tried rebooking for the next day however all tickets were sold out, and they do not run a waiting list. We turned up the next day only to experience more of the non-existent organization. There was quite a group of people who came to look for returned tickets. The fact that our ticket was cancelled previous day did not give us any priority, so we were at the end of the queue. However that did not matter much anyway - when returned tickets were brought in - they told that they wouldn't take anyone any way because it was already too late to take any one on to the boat that was still in the process of boarding. But they did not bother informing us at the right time... In the end we took some boat trip from the harbour, saw dolphins playing in the sea, had about 1.5 hour boat ride (with a small group of people, rather than 200+ as on Robben island boats) and feel got a better deal. Only a pity it has wasted our valuable time."

We were up so early that morning that we saw the sun rise over Table Mountain, when our taxi dropped near the Victoria and Alfred area it was as though we were the only people awake. We took our four children aged 9 - 16 and they enjoyed it thoroughly. On the short boat journey out to the island we saw dolphins. As other reviews have described, you then take a bus tour around the Island which was short and informative and helped to put the experience into perspective. When the bus stopped we looked around and took photos of the views, we didn't go to the shop. The tour of the prison given by an ex-prisoner was humbling and I felt that we were lucky to be there, very soon there will be no ex-prisoners there to bring it alive. My children still discuss the visit and I believe that it was a fantastic experience for them. Although Cape Town is a fabulous and beautiful city with loads to do, I feel that anyone who visits the area without doing the trip to Robben Island is missing out on a core aspect of the city and of South Africa. From the nine year old to the 45 year old, we all found the trip to be interesting, informative, moving and well worth doing!"

The museum is the best proof, as former prisoners and former prison guards are now tour guides and colleagues. They even live together in the village on the island! The tour guide on the bus was also excellent, explaining in detail the background to some of the key defining moments in the Apartheid period.Check-in was smooth, the ride out was rough due to the strong winds and a rather small boat. The transfer back to Cape Town was both faster and smoother, due to the much larger size of the boat (catamaran).As this is a popular excursion it pays to pre-book tickets on-line (essentially the same site as theTable Mountain Cableway)"

This is a journey that I've wanted to make for many years as, apart from its recent notoriety, my father was stationed there for a short while during the second world war. The journey to the island is by boat and as the newest vessel is out of commission due to an accident some 9 months ago, tourists are taken out in the older vessels. For us it was a piece of history as we went out on a boat that was originally used to take prisoners to the island. The boat was in need of refurbishment! Once on the island you are shepherded to a fleet of waiting buses that take you on a tour of the island. They point out buildings of interest as well as the naval gun displacements, fauna and flora. Our guide was very informative and fairly easy to understand although I was told by some others that this is not always the case. I was truck be the lack of maintenance with buildings showing distinct signs of wear and tear with paintwork peeling, windows broken, fences down and gates hanging off their hinges. The second part of the tour is on foot. The guide, an ex inmate, takes you through the high security wing when Nelson Mandela and other political prisoners were housed. The commentary was good if a bit difficult to understand at times. My main comment is that in a large group you were given very little time to look into the cells and absorb the atmosphere. There is a well stocked souvenir store on the dockside which you can visit before boarding the boat back to the mainland."

We were aware of the need to book early (on-line tickets sold out fast) but we took a chance by visiting the ticket office early and were still able to get a sailing that morning. As it is a one hour trip each way and about three hours on the island I would recommend the 10am or earlier sailing. The boat trip to the island was good, with amazing views of Table Mountain and the coastline. On arrival we were divided into groups and driven in buses around the island. The sheer volume of visitors on the island was handled well and the drive around the island organised so that groups arriving at different areas was staggered. Our guide told us a lot about the history of the island and we stopped at several places be shown around the prison, including Nelson Mandela\u2019s cell. Our trip concluded with a very moving account from one of the ex-prisoners sharing his story. It was very worthwhile \u2013 moving and sobering, but demonstrated the power of the human spirit."

We were kept waiting and no one told us what was going on. The queue began to move 40 minutes after the scheduled departure time. We were put through airport style security and held in another very small room. Several minutes later a lady said that she was taking us round to the quay side for the ferry because their own quay is under construction. We were then led outside, past the shops and restaurants to a completely different place. What was the point of the security check? The ferry could not have been sea worthy in a million years. An ancient converted fishing boat more like. The sea journey was awful. We were so late that the visit had to be rushed. I felt totally cheated. The thing I wanted to see was rushed and we were just ushered around. The guide on our bus was jovial, knowledgeable and interesting. The ex prisoner clearly wanted to talk but was fixated by the time and making sure that we were back on the quay side on time. He was great and gave a personal insight into life as a prisoner. Such a pity he had to cut it short. The journey back was the worst experience of my life, and to top it off we landed at the quay side right next to the place we had queued at for ages beforehand! No construction in sight. My advice would be to book with a tour group with a good boat not the museum. As a national treasure, the museum really should get this sorted out if the trip is going to survive as an attraction."

The queue to board the ferry was organised chaos, no one seemed to know what was going on, then the ferries did not look sea worthy and were all running late. So on arrival at the island we were hurriedly put on a bus because we were running late. We stopped at the tea room which was not adequately stocked and the rest rooms were inadequate to cope with the amount of people - only two ladies toilettes, so therefore I did not have enough time to even visit the tea room, although my husband managed but they had already run out of sandwiches. We were then hurriedly scuttled back on to the bus and speedily went through the rest of the tour. When we got off the bus at the prison building there was another guide, an ex prisoner who took us around, but we could not hear the guide properly and he was also rushing and not very friendly, so we missed quite a bit about what he was saying. We also ran out of time to visit the gift shop as we had to get back onto the ferry, as we were told on arrival that we would be visiting the gift shop. On the trip back on the ferry speaking to other visitors we realised that there was a lot that we did not see and visa versa. As a World Heritage site the buildings and gardens are not maintained at all and if no maintenance work is carried out, there won't be a future heritage site. We personally felt it was a waste of time and money, and a huge disappointment."

The journey to the island, which takes about an hour by boat is VERY choppy, and all passengers experienced seasickness, so take medication if you can/be warned!When you arrive on the island, you immediately board a crowded tour bus (a challenge after the aforementioned seasickness). A guide then gives about an hour's tour of the island from the bus, explaining the history of the island and about some of the prisoners. There is a toilet/refreshment stop half way through which provides a chance to get some fresh air, then back on the bus for the rest of the tour.You get off the bus at the prison building where Mandela's cell was, and receive a tour from a former prisoner, who shows you around the group cells and explains what life was like there.

There are a couple of opportunities to get out walk around, take photos etc. Afterwards, you tour the prison itself.

Occasionally the guide will point out largely irrelevant sights or will point out something of great interest and then fail to explain much about its history. However, that being said, once going inside the prison blocks where Nelson Mandela and other political prisoners were kept, we were given another guide who was an actual political prisoner. He was very informative and provided great detail into what life was like for prisoners - this was the real highlight of the tour. Overall, the visit is very worthwhile, but if you want to know a great deal about Robben Island, I suggest reading a fair deal about its background before embarking on the tour."

We then stopped at the restrooms and were told we have 15 minutes to get refreshments and go to the restrooms. Very little time with 4 busses at the same spot with 2 loos and 4 kids. We then went to the prison. The gentleman basically repeated nearly all the bus guide had told us and we could hardly hear what he was saying (maybe a microphone would help)Cages like dog kennels??? Rock pile??? Story about the Key??? We were then quickly shown Madibas cell and the courtyard. We then had a short walk back to the curio shop (when on landing we were told we could browse a dash) only to be told the boat was leaving.THE LITTER ON THIS BEAUTIFUL ISLAND IS SHOCKING!!!

The experience on the island lived up to expecttions; we saw for ourselves the conditions the captives including Nelson Mandela lived in and the open mines they worked under the constant hot sun. The crossing by boat was dasastrous. Rough sea caused cancellations of two trips in the morning and a knock-on to delays all day. Nobody's fault of course. But the queue was enough to fill 3 boats and we were kept waiting about 90 minutes. Nobody made any effort to tell us what was happening and rumours passed down the line that all crossings had been cancelled for the day. I spoke to the staff on behalf of everyone and asked for us all to be given an explanation. This was done but they told us so little it was pointless. Nobody took charge. Refunds should have been offered to people who had other plans later and to those who would suffer sea-sickness. All very disappointing"

The 30 minute or so ferry ride to Robben Island was a little rough. I am notoriously seasick but I did surprisingly well with one of those medication patches you put behind your ear. When you reach the island you are guided and separated into buses and taken around the island for about an hour before you are actually taken to the prison. From the bus they break you into further groups and are assigned guides who are ex prisoners. The hallways are narrow and we had a big group of people. It was somewhat hard to hear the guide that was assigned to us so try and be close to him as you can. He was good at explaining the circumstances that led to Mandela's imprisonment and showed us a quick look at Mandela's cell and even locked us up inside one of the bigger cells so we would feel what was like to be in prison there. What was important was the tour instead of being depressing ended up in a positive note."

How sad that these people with any form of Mental Illness were separated from society and set apart as if they did not belong. Very often today they prove that they have a valuable contribution to make to society. This separation was ended in the early 1900 by my grandfather, as Mayor of Greater Cape Town.

Although I was not expecting a brilliant orator, I was definitely hoping to hear and learn much more about the prison and life in there. What was a typical day like in prison? What did the prisoners do everyday? What were some of the significant or interesting stories that happened in there? Unfortunately, I felt a little like a sheep being herded around the buildings with the rest of my flock. There was no time to properly see the prison buildings or even to get a good sense of the size and scale of the whole set up. You are brought in and before you know it you are brought out again.On the second part of the tour, we were kept on a bus the whole time except for the end when we were released onto this place to take photos of Cape Town across the sea and to use the toilet. After that it was back onto the bus to be taken back to the pier. There was no chance to visit the significant buildings and sites. We could only look at them from the bus.I am still glad that I had made the trip, just to see the buildings.

After disembarking from the boat, we were herded onto a crowded bus-hard to take pictures through the window as we drove past most sights. There were a couple of quick stops, but most of the tour was simply drive-by. The end of the tour was conducted by a former inmate of the system there. Just because you were an inmate does not make you an interesting tour guide! We could not hear most of what was being said-very disappointing part of the tour.

Our Tour Operator on the bus seemed very bored with her job and asked for tip as we left. Would have gladly tipped if she offered anything interesting. Part of experience of tour was with former political inmate which was quite interesting so of course he got tipped. Obviously, everyone wants to see Nelson Mandela's cell more than anything else.Keep in mind - It takes a big portion of your day - getting to and back from location at V & A and the boat ride, the tour...etc.Great views of Cape Town and Table Mountain from boat."

The significance of this Island should never be overlooked , especially when its history is so recent .Against the backdrop of a peaceful , tranquil island lays the brutal and unfair history of wrongful imprisonments , punishment and murder . During the tour and the story is told by ex-prisoners , and you leave the island knowing that good came from this story in the end . The main theme being one of perseverance and bravery in the face of all adversitry. To be physically in the Jails and the island when listening makes the story so more powerful.I think the trip to this island should be a must for all students in South Africa or anyone else who visits Cape town."

We caught the ferry, named Autshumato, after the first prisoner who successfully escaped the island. That was in the 17C. Five other prisoners successfully escaped, all occurring in the 17th C. Usually on small boats. A Xhosa Chief, Makano, tried to escape in the early 19th C but was recaptured.On arrival at the island we were shepherded to a bus and did the tour. The guide was a sweet chap named Johnny. He told us all about the island as we drove around. We drove through the village, past the nature reserve, past Robert Sobukwe\u2019s house, past the criminal\u2019s prison, past two churches. The older one, the Church of the Good Sheppard, was the lepers\u2019 church for male lepers. (Robben Is. was once a lepers\u2019 colony). This would have been demolished along with all other buildings pertaining to the lepers, but it was the only church that did not belong to the state and the Anglican Church, who owned it, refused to have it destroyed. It is a very pretty little church. Then to the Maximum-security prison for the political prisoners of the 20thC.There, we were met by an ex-prisoner, one Lionel Davis, who was incarcerated for seven years from 1964. He was there just before Mandela. He was jailed for committing acts of sabotage. It was quite moving listening to him although we knew the basic story already. It is well worth the visit"

The boat experience was pleasurable - although rather windy on the deck. There was however plenty of protection indoors with good views through the large windows. It is always spectacular to see Cape Town and Table Mountain from the sea. Robben Island itself is rather barren, with sparse vegetation, which highlights the conditions which previous residents, namely Lepers and Prisoners must have endured. We were driven around the island and shown the accommodation which prior to the island becoming a prison colony, housed Lepers. We were also shown the lime quarry where Nelson Mandela spent many hours in hard labour. Another interesting fact is that the island apparently has a maze of underground tunnels. The prison itself is also a very basic building with no signs of luxury. It was certainly an eye-opener to see how hard it must have been to have spent so many years incarcerated there. One cannot help but identify strongly with the experiences of the prisoners and to admire their tenacity. I would recommend a visit to Robben Island. Suggestion: have your snacks ready to enjoy on the boat. There is no time or opporunity for snacking during the tour."

It was an indescribable experience on the island, one could sense the emotions through the walls of the prison, if walls could only speak, about all the hardship that took place. It was very interesting to learn about our own South African history and also that of our late beloved president Tata Madiba (Nelson Mandela). This was a very inspirational experience, especially for me a young person, to carry on the legacy that our great president started, that of a united \"rainbow nation\". We were also very fortunate to listen to the experience of an ex-convict and also to hear something from one of the guards that served at the time Nelson Mandela was a prisoner on the island. Definitely a must for all visitors to Cape Town and all South Africans, to gain knowledge of what our fore fathers had to go through, in order for us to gain freedom. I am very proud to be a South African, and fortunate that what happened in the past, stays there, for good."

We only get to see a small part of the island although it's worth doing if only to garner how others lived on the island.The best bit by far was the visit to the prison compound itself. Seeing how and where Mandela and all the other many political prisoners lived for so many years was humbling. Our guide, as are all the guides, was an ex-political prisoner once imprisoned like Mandela. He was just brimming with information about apartheid, the anti-movement, as well as his own personal story. It was only spoiled in part by the ignorant and incessant gibbering of some of the other visitors in our tour group, while he was trying to speak.Our ferry back was 'fun'! It was the last one back around 18.00hrs, it was dark by then - and it was CHOPPY!! A lot of very sick people.... :("

We saw the cells, the workyards and we learnt about the conditions. We visited the infamous stone quarry where prisoners broke rocks. And we visited Mandela's simple cell. It was enough.

First you are being shoved like sardines in a can on a tourbus, that takes you around the island, you stop, take a few pictures and move on, all whilst remaining on the bus. Then there is a little break where you have a shop, toilets and a chance to take some nice panoramic pictures of Cape Town. Then you get dropped off at the high security prison, where you get a tour by an ex-inmate.Reading that, you have to make a conscientious decision. What happened there is terrible and should never be forgotten and it has to be visited, on the other hand The tour is 3 hours, will it not be a waste of time. Well, we decided to go and what we found there was exaclty as described in the guidebook. We booked tickets for the day previously, but due to bad weather (???) this was cancelled, so we managed to get on the tour the next day. For some reason we didn't go with the normal boat, but with another (slower) one. So this added another hour on our journey, one way! When we finally got to the island, the busses were already waiting for us. On the bus you get this monotonous speech by someone who seems to be wishing she was anywhere else but there. We hadn't driven for 10 minutes when we stopped for a 15 minute break. This was probably the highlight as the place has a nice view over Cape Town to make some panoramic pictures. Next, you drive another 5 minutes and then you are back at the maximum security prison where you are greeted by the ex political prisoner. unfortunately you are spending a lot of time waiting for the group to catch up, who are barely listening to what this person has to say, that you can see the annoyance on his face. People are pushing and talking through everyting and when we got to one of the final places where he had a long narrative, lots of people kept disturbing him by coming in much later than the rest of the group.All in all, it was an interesting and educative experience, but you feel like a school class, even worse, in a class the kids stick together. The ferry was slow, but offered the opportunity to make some nice pictures of Cape Town, seals and if you're lucky even dolphins."

So it immediately when on my list of things to do.I finally got there in Dec 2013 it is definitely a must see. The tour was great and really was a time for reflection on the political prisoners being held here. especially since you can meet a prisoner as one will be your tour guide. In a weird way this was a draw to take the tour as I was very interested to hearing what they may have to say. It was also very weird as our guide was just such a gentle sweet soul that I couldn't imagine that he was incarcerated. HINT: have an intelligent question prepared for them as I think people react like our group did when they ask you if you want to know anything about them. Everyone was shy or tongue tied and just the same questions came out...like ...what was it like to be in prison? Where were my questions? So have a great chance here so have something prepared.the tours are half day and you really are not permitted to stay longer. You have to go back on the ferry that brought you. This was one negative for me, I would have loved to have stayed longer and just walked around as it is a beautiful island and unbelievable view of table mountain so we would have like to have had more free time to walk around.Other tips:1. booking ahead of time is a must. Just like Alcatraz, if you don't book ahead you are not going. 2. Book your tickets early in your stay as there is a good chance the ferry will be cancelled due to weather. This way you can re-book another day or you have more options to book another visit.3. don't worry if your ferry gets cancelled, this happens often and I must say I was very worried about not easily getting a refund. Since it happens often, they are very good about rebooking or refunding. I would suggest that if your ferry gets cancelled do not leave the ferry bldg. Line up with everyone else, the line moves fast and they ask you if you want a refund or book another date. So we re-booked for the next morning. Don't think you are going to just show up the next day with your old tickets and get on it doesn't work that way. Line up and get the new tickets for your best chance.4. On the ferry you want to be on the top deck for photos and it can get very windy so bring a hat and windbreaker or warm coat5. The HOHO bus stops nearby. I believe it is stop 2 on the red route so after your visit to the Island you can continue on your sightseeing using the HOHO.We had the gorgeous day, not a cloud in the sky and the views of Cape Town were those quintessential views of table mountain I didn't realize this was where everyone is getting those shots. Also when you stop for your bathroom break on the bus part of the tour be sure to explore around as this area has the best view of Cape Town with the Robben Island rocks in the foreground.Walking around the prison cells and incarceration area is hard (mentally not physically) and very thought provoking but this a one of the gifts of travel. Of course, Mr Mandela is constantly on your mind while you are walking around. In the back of my mind I was singing \"Free Nelson Mandela\" by The Specials. I know Cape Town has so many things to do so plan a long visit."

The tour around the prison is also quite dull. It could be considerably improved with video/audio footage of Mandela's more significant speeches. as a South African I understood and was able to relate to most of what was said but I feel no effort was made for international visitors w.r.t. language issues.

The highlight of course was a walk through the prison where so many political prisoners were detained, the most well-known being Nelson Mandela, or Madiba as he is more affectionately known. As a returning South African who was actively involved in the struggle for a free democratic South Africa back in the '80s the visit was especially poignant. Through the incredible authentic commentary of our tour guide, we captured and had an insight into prison life during his incarceration. Definitely a must do when you visit Cape Town.

My personal experience was buying my ticket the previous day at 1pm I was told that there was no tour at 11 am so bought for 10. I arrived and joined a queue boarding a ferry at 9.30 when I reached the head of it the lady told me that this was the 9 am sailing but if I went to the ticket office they would reissue and all would be well I did so along with many other people and was told I would now be leaving at 11am ! so I had been messed about and lied too. On the Ferry I found a printed email From a Mohamed Hassan to various employees timed at 5.21 the previous day say that they had not sold enough tickets and so would cut some of the sailings  The Island Itself was a wasted opportunity mostly on a bus when it would have been possible, and I think intended for us to walk as we drove past information boards. We were shown round the prison by an ex inmate which was a great idea but the group was to large and his talk too wooden- and yes when you leave he shakes your hand to get a tip ( I gave one as walking round somewhere you were imprisoned for a living seems harsh) they then said the ferry was delayed by 10 mins the fact it was nowhere insight gave the lie to this two it arrived after 40 mins and no further announcements!  This could be great but its not and for some stupid reason they redecorated Your man's cell"

This is a boat trip to Robben Island, where the \"museum\" is; total time is around 4 hours.I booked a ticket for 1pm, but there were too many people for that boat so I had to wait 45 minutes for the next one; I question what the point of booking a timed ticket is when you can not get on the boat at the time you've booked.The boat takes 45 minutes; when you arrive, you are transferred to a bus which takes you down to one end, where there is a cafe; a guide gives you commentary - you see the Leper's graveyard, a church, the village...there's not a great deal to see.After this, you meet an ex political prsioner who gives you a tour of the prison; interesting anedotes but not a lot to see. I did wonder if I'd missed something, but having spoken to other tourists who had done the trip, they all said the same thing; overrated and poor planning: one couple had to wait over an hour for a return boat.If you're short on time, there may be better ways to spend it.."

An international icon, yet nowhere near international standards in terms of the information provided - not even multilingual tour guides providing the information. The tour cam across as very rushed and rehearsed, with the tour guides rattling off their rehearsed lines in monotone fashion, not even pausing between sentences to breathe. We had great difficulty even understanding them as they mumbled through their words. Not even at the tuc shop stop did they provide for selling of books to further enhance one's knowledge - not even the famous Mandela's Long Walk to Freedom. I suggest if you make this trip, take it into your own hands to educate yourself before the time on all details in order to gain the most benefit of the trip. Not enough seating for all passengers on the boat - requiring some to stand for 45 minutes per leg of the journey. Broken toilets with broken off toilet seats added to the run down atmosphere of the entire tour."

And it is tiring to spend 45 minutes in a boat and another 45 back. The bus that drives you around is not especially comfortable... It is a prison... A prison for innocent people, for men whose only sin was to dream of equality and freedom.It is a very touching experience: Guides are ex-prisoners, who else could better describe life in the island as a captive? And looking at the small cell where Mandela spent 14 years, and the limestone mine where he was forced to work everyday whose stone powder damaged his eyes making him unable to cry, makes you reflect... Because that same man joined a country broken by injustice and racial abuse to proclaim forgiveness."

When originally planning my trip to South Africa I nearly skipped taking the Robben Island tour because of some of the negative reviews on this site.

The ferry ride from the mainland to the island was a treat in and of itself\u2026 the views of Table Mountain and the peninsula were lovely. Our tour guide was a very engaging man and related many fascinating stories about his experience in the prison (all tours are guided by former inmates). I found seeing Nelson Mandela\u2019s cell with my own eyes to be a very powerful experience. While we didn\u2019t have a lot of time for thought and reflection, that\u2019s simply the nature of taking a group tour with many people. After touring the jail there is a bus tour of the island which was very interesting. It took us past many notable sites including the Limestone quarry where Mr. Mandela toiled for years. Most intriguing to me was the residential town that still exists on the island. I had no idea there were about 200 residents living there, a mix of guards and former inmates. Overall a pleasant and educational morning."

In another building were cells we could walk through with photos of the prisoners and dated placards with words they wrote about they felt about their prison time. It was further out than I thought it would be and the ferry took about an hour each way plus another couple of hours on the island, so it took up a big part of the day. For me it was something worth seeing and reenforced the hardship that Mandela endured with such grace and dignity as he came out without hatred and went on fighting for freedom and becoming President.

It was so bad that my girlfriend fell asleep. When we finally got off the bus, an ex-prisoner took us through the main prison. Again, random rubbish of no real interest.

The coach tour of the island was very limited - poor guide, too long at some sites, no time to take photos at others, eg the quarry. No time to effectively read all the fascinating information on the various boards in the prison. We were rushed around. There were some very positive features - the conducted tour of the maximum security prison by a former political prisoner was excellent. This gave a real insight into the island. I would like to have heard more about the history of the island pre Mandella. As the experience stands, I feel that South African Heritage Authority needs to review its procedures, and the selection and training of its guides."

The ferry ride was about 45 mins and the views were beautiful. My mother and I went on the 2pm tour, so on the way home we enjoyed a stunning sunset. The ride back was a bit choppy, but that is to be expected when you are on a boat and the wind picks up. The bus ride seems brief, but the tour guide was very knowledgable and the main attraction is the walking tour of the prison itself. You are lead through the prison by a former prisoner, who provides firsthand knowledge of his experience. The question and answer portion was very eye opening. There were small children on the tour when we attended, but I would think it is better suited for the older age groups. It is a solemn reminder of the country's recent past, but also sends a hopeful message for the future."

I do not think safety was taken seriously as people were not counted on and the \"this is a life jacket\" demo did not take place until we'd nearly arrived. The coach trip around Robben Island was both interesting and informative and the ex-political prisoner giving the tour of the cell at the end was both hard to hear and understand, a shame as I am sure he was very interesting.

Once on the island, ex-political prisoners provide intimate 1st hand account of how it felt during those imprisonment years.- Poor experience once ticket boughtYou book your ticket with stamped time of departure, but you\u2019re instead stuck queuing for an hour to board cramped ship. You go through dubious security clearance, manned by too many state employees not doing much.- Old boats & insufficient capacityThe original boat (max cap. 90 passengers) broke down (engine fire). We were stranded on the island in poor wet weather for extra 3 hrs. They have a newer catamaran (cap. 70) but it took them a while to decide and send back, worst of all we were kept in the dark throughout. Frankly, they could do with more boats, newer ones, and more frequent schedule\u2026 20 people were stuck for 5 hrs in total.- Information, in wrong place at the wrong timeThere are tons of interesting info compiled and plastered over a wall, unfortunately it\u2019s all located at the waiting room for the boat ride back. I guess they knew we will be making use! The boat ride is 35-45mins each way, depending on the boat you get, which is completely idle time \u2013 maybe they could use this better to educate, possibly over audio guide? Instead, the occasional seals that swam by the boat entertained us.Overall, you get the impression that, despite the best efforts of the local guides, the place deserves better investement in infrastructure than it is getting now, especially as it is an important fixture in many tourists' itineraries. RIM\u2019s website states that they are responsible for, \u201cmanaging, maintaining, presenting, developing & marketing\u2026 as a national estate and World Heritage site\u201d. None of this came across to us while we were there for half a day\u2026a real big shame. The JHB Apartheid museum was so much better!"

I think they first fill up a larger (and older, not well-maintained boat) and then the remaining passengers get on a smaller boat.Once we arrived at Robben Island, we all boarded buses and were driven about a minute away to the prison (literally a minute). It seemed foolish to get on the bus but I think that's how they keep the groups together. I've heard mixed reviews about the tour and some very unkind things said about the prisoners. For example, someone stated \"we're being guided by an ex-con.\" The prisoners giving the tours are political prisoners NOT criminals. Our guide was great! You could see the pain and suffering he and the other prisoners endured. Its amazing that after such a traumatic experience he was able to come back and share his story. The tour of the prison was heartbreaking - I can't believe that so many of the prisoners were made to sleep on the hard floors of these tiny cells. Its sad to know that people were treated differently and given more or less amenities and even food based on the color of their skin (even between \"colored\" and \"black\" prisoners). The tour was moving and I would definitely recommend it. Unfortunately, the rest of the tour of the island was not necessary and it would be nice if there was a way to opt out of it. So don't expect much after the prison tour."

Whilst the audioguide at Alcatraz is one of the best I've ever done, readers here will be aware that on Robben, you are guided around by an ex-political prisoner who can elaborate and answer questions, and the numbers of people in any one spot are much less than Alcatraz; each bus load forms a separate party, and contrary to some reviews I think it was pretty well organised, (and frankly a pretty daft idea to want to roam the island on foot without a guide). There's more to the Island than the max security prison, which adds interest, but of course the main event is Mandela's incarceration and there's plenty of information and background to all that. According to our Guide, the prison scenes and settings of the recent film biopic Long Walk to Freedom were pretty accurate. Like Alactraz you would be unlikely to manage to secure a ticket on the day as they tours are very popular and usually booked out well in advance. We booked on-line and our printed-off eTicket worked fine."

I know this is a very british thing to say but imagine a French or Italian ski lift queue and then quadruple it and add some octogenarians and people in wheelchairs. It really was that bad. There was a group of old ladies that got crushed in the rush to get on a boat (the only boat for another hour). It was just awful and really soured the whole experience. Surely it is not beyond the management to organise a queuing system, I refuse to believe it is cultural because the customs queue to get in the country is VERY organised."

Then, the typical no customer service experience you get when an organisation has a monopoly and has no clue what to do when things go wrong. What a shambles and a dangerous shambles to boot. Apparently, (so the story goes, as we only got the information 2nd hand, as no one from the tour company bothered to inform us or speak to us at all for the hours whilst we waited in the cold and wet on Robben Island), a ferry broke down, and they did not have a spare......one turned up 3 hrs late, but could only take some of the people waiting. Now, rather than actually use a brain cell or two, and organise the hordes who were waiting, it was every man, woman and child for themselves. Pushing and shoving, onto a board walk, which barely looked capable of handling half the number. No message from the tour operator on board the boat and no one there to greet us when we arrived. I do say thank you to the ladies on Robben Island who run the store, as they kindly did offer a packet of crisps and a bottle,of drink to people whilst we waited. To the rest of the tour operator, I say you are a disgrace to the Sth African tourism industry and you did your country a very sad disservice with your conduct and behaviour. I hope for the sake of others you learn from the experience and consider some business continuity plans in your business model.

We were then shown around the prison by an ex -political prisoner who had been there for 5 years and been involved in the 1976 uprisings as a teenager.The downside was the fact that the weather was poor the day we went and I was surprised that the boat had open sides - so it was pretty chilly and we were not dressed for the weather! It took an hour to get out to the island. The weather had got even colder when we were due to return. Sadly there was a 2nd boat departing with an inside compartment which looked much more appealing. I don't know who runs runs this boat but if you can take it - I think you will have a more comfortable trip. With regards to things like eating - there is little on the island apart from coffee and chocolate bars so eat before you go, or take a snack! Overall don't miss it - it is a must! You can read about it and see it on TV but nothing replaces seeing it.

Nelson cell was the highlight for me."

The seas were a bit choppy crossing over, but then the boat was quite sturdy. I disagree with reviewer that the boats are not seaworthy. I doubt whether South Africa will allow, in any case, for visitors to Robben Island to cross over on a rickety banana boat. It was a pleasant sunny day and most passengers sat or stood on the decks. Disappointing was the bus-tour. We could have walked! Information on various areas, as conveyed by the tour-guide on the bus, was short and bitter-sweet. Since such a small is open to visitors, walking would be eco-friendly - instead of polluting fauna and flora with diesel buses. The visit to the prison itself was guided by former prisoner Mr. S. A charming and knowledgeable person. Robben Island reminded of a modern day Concentration Camp and a sad place to visit. Mr. S spent too much time in one area and rushed at the next. There is no proper planning with regard to the splitting of tours around the prison premises - organisation and time management is what they need to improve!! At the end of the Tour it was apparent that we needed to rush back to the boat which was due to leave in 10 minutes!!!! This time the crossing was on a Catamaran- and even this was pleasant!!"

Loaded onto buses and given a bit of a tour of the island; however, seeing the WWII cannon isn't the purpose of people's visits and wouldn't detract from anyone's experience if it wasn't part of the tour.That being said, the tour of the prison area was given by an ex-prisoner and was excellent. It was very interesting to hear of the experience he and others had to endure.We got a little bit of the stupidity of the apartheid system from the tour guide, but more of that and the prisoners' experience and less of the village/outlying areas would make the tour a better experience.Also, figuring out a way to create the tour such that there'd be a self-guided portion with exhibits would be a plus."

The ferry was full and we had to sit inside. Not the most comfortable place to be on a 45 minute ride. There were no drinks or other food items to purchase on the boat even though there was a snack bar. We met some great people from England and that made the trip palatable.When we arrived on the island there were bathrooms but the snack bar had no water for purchase. We were loaded onto busses and given a tour of the island. We saw the prison building, the houses of current inhabitants of the island, the abandoned school, and penguins. We had a knowledgeable guide who provided an informative commentary on our trip.We stopped at another refreshment building and there was water but no soft drinks.We were then let out at the prison and a former political prisoner continued the tour. He was able to fill in the details of life at the prison as he experienced it. We saw the cells and were able to see the cell that Nelson Mandela was in. My son recognized it from the movie INVICTUS which was filmed there. Other cells contained remembrances of the prisoners who had used them. It was moving and extremely interesting. On the ride back we were able to get outside seats which was better but the smell from the bathrooms on the boat was very strong.I was glad we made the trip but it is long ferry ride and somewhat disorganized."

Ordered mine directly from them on the internet before leaving home. The trip was so booked they had to take two boats in shifts to Robben Island. You go over by boat and imagine being a prisoner taken to an island where you have no communication with family and friends. The boat can be rocky....coming back in the evening there were very rough waters.When you arrive you are first taken by bus tour around the island. You get history of the Island, other uses besides the prison - leper colony, see the area where prison warden and guards families lived and see the general area of the prison. Of course you can only imagine how nicely it has been fixed up for tours and that the prison is not what Mandela and other political prisoners experienced for decades until it was finally closed. After a bus tour around you are dropped off for a walking tour. The guide will be one of several former prisoners of Robben Island. They tell you about the real conditions prisoners faced. You will see Mandela's cell, the rock quarry (if you've seen the film: Mandela The Long Walk to Freedom, this will all be put into perspective.) Many signs around the island put history into perspective. It was a moving experience and for those close to the experiences of apartheid and the history of S. Africa and Mandela's struggles for freedom, it may leave you breathless. This should be a Do Not Miss tour if you come to Cape Town. Note:There is a small colony of penguin being rebuilt on the island. They use to be plentiful,"

At no point was there anyone to tell us what was going on.Sadly my overwhelming memory of the day is of frustrion and anger about the manner in which we were treated."

Weather and rough seas caused our initial trip to be cancelled - however, the service, information and online admin. at this stage were all excellent. We re-booked and set off full of anticipation. Unfortunately, there was a mess-up with the buses at the island harbour and we walked up to the prison, only to be told - on the tour bus - that we were going all the way back to the harbour to pick up some people from a later ferry! Our on-bus guide had a delivery and style he was determined to use to the full - despite the not inconsiderable delay - and the island tour was, frankly, unnecessary and boring, with almost nothing to see except the limestone quarry. And why we needed a 'pit-stop' after 30 minutes, only the cafe-bar owners will know! Once we finally got into the actual prison itself, things improved with a first class presentation from a former prisoner who had an awesome, inspirational style. Sadly, we had used up so much of our time that he had to rush the final part of the tour, so we were left with virtually no time to take in the 'read-only' displays and almost ran back to catch the last ferry. Overall, this was not as interactive or informative as we had hoped - by comparison check out Alcatraz! - so we were left very disappointed, and being over an hour late getting back into Cape Town did nothing to help our mood."

In rough sea the departures often are cancelled with short notice. On arrival to the Island you will line up for a one hour bus drive around at the southern part of the Island. There will be a guide on board telling the story of the Island. There is very little to see. Only a couple of queries where building materials were cut from the limestone and granite. A few historical buildings. Thats all, but the view to Cape Town and Table mountain is stunning.The final tour of the prison was in some way interesting. But the former prisoner explained about the daily life of the prisoners with a very low voice, which could only be heard by the people closest to him. You can get much more info about the subject from one of the many books about the Island and the life of Mandela.Do not bring smaller kids on the tour. There is very little for them to do.In general you will only feel a kick of history being there. Thats all. Spend instead your time visiting Stellenbosch and Cape the good hope or climb the Lions Head if you are in shape. The view to Cape Town is worth the trouble getting to the top."

He had a coach load of people from numerous countries hanging on to his every word. Then came the former political prisoner who showed us round the prison, who was equally as enthralling, and detailed the history of the prison without a hint of bitterness or malice. It was all very poignant and moving, from which we got a far better understanding of the struggles, and we're even more amazed therefore that the leaders taught forgiveness, and encouraged equality and forward thinking, when vengeance might have been an easier choice. The world has a great deal to learn from the people who inhabited the island. 3 hours very well spent and an absolute must if you're in Cape Town."

When we arrived we were told exactly how our two hour tour would be spent. First there was the tour of the high security prison with ex prisoner guide ( I think called Mr Nkosa) who spoke clearly and was charming. He showed us exactly which cell had housed Nelson Mandela for so many years as well as telling us his own story of his five years spent on Robben island. Then straight to the bus tour where a young guide did a good job showing us the quarry where the political prisoners spent weeks breaking rocks in the sun but also planning out a new national constitution in a small cave. A quick stop for ice cream and ladies room (very clean) and to take a picture with table mountain viewed over the waves (table mountain wasn't mentioned once by any of the guides) and then back to the port for the ride home.

This is an important part of world history so I would still urge travellers to go but it is badly structured and organised so don't expect too much. The trip starts with an hour long journey on a dirty, noisy, poorly maintained boat (two ladies on the trip fell backwards when the back of their seat fell off. It had obviously been \"repaired\" before). On arrival at the island, visitors are guided onto buses for a 45 minute tour of the island's sights. The guide was reasonably entertaining and informative but the enforced jollity was a bit wearing. All a bit reminiscent of a 1970s package tour to Spain!The second half of the tour is a guided visit to the prison block conducted by an old inmate. Again, interesting but, for me, the presentation style had too much \"entertainment\" value and not enough focus on the situation that resulted in Mandela and others being there. There is no time for individual reflection, to wander around, to take in the enormity of apartheid rule etc. in fact, at the end of the tour all 80 on the trip literally had to run down the quayside to catch the boat to the mainland. Despite the fact that the boat was laid on specially for the tour, the crew wanted home, a handful of our group, including a young lady in a wheelchair, were left on the quay. In summary, a disappointing tour but still a must see"

You are no sooner off the boat and then on a bus, we as a family of 5 (including 2 children 7 & 10) were pushed onto an already full bus and split up to take up any remaining seats so not great for the children.The guide was Ok but seemed more interested in where we all cam from & telling us about the wildlife on Robben Island and giving us photo opportunities of Table Mountain rather that why 99% of people were there and to learn more about the prison in which Nelson Mandela was kept for so many years.There were so many iconic sights and information boards that you cannot get to read or see as you are never let out of the bus other than at the shop to take more photos of ......Table Mountain!!!The guide even told us that we should complain to the Tourist Board about the trip as he said the routine was out dated and needed a complete makeover including walking and cycling options around the Island.After about 30 minutes we were dropped off at the entrance to the prison to be given a guided tour by an ex prisoner. I understand that all the guides have their own story of why they were imprisoned and their time on Robben Island but again 99% of the people are there for one reason - Nelson Mandela and wanted more of an insight into his time and influence while on Robben Island. We had to ask which was his cell and then it was a mad rush for everyone to take a photo as we were ushered out of the corridor and back into the exercise yard. We were then told we had 10 minutes before the boats were leaving and to make sure we didn't miss these as we would have to wait 3 hours for the next ones to depart. The little gift shop by the boat drop off point is never going to make any money as visitors haven't got time to go in. We had our photos taken as we got onto the boat at the start of the day but never found out where these could be purchased.What should be a thought provoking trip into such an Iconic piece of South African history was let down by poor organisation and structure to the trip."

Our flt took 14 hours and by the time we checked into our hotel we were shattered. To add to our problems the date on my watch had not changed. Therefore, when we rocked up for our trip we were a day late. I explained what had occurred but the staff at the Nelson Mandela at the V&A dock where the ferry leaves from, were unrelenting. No rescheduling, either that day or any other. They were adamant that we were not going to Robben Island unless we purchased two more tickets. As we were on a budget this was not possible. I can understand a NO REFUND policy, but surely it is not too much to expect a reschedule. Coming fromAustralia we are unable to return and this has left a very bitter taste of our visit to what is after all a lovely friendly city."

Considering I am South African, Robben Island seems to be one of those places that one needs to visit in one's lifetime to consider yourself a true South African - a pilgrimage as it were. So dutifully, I booked a trip out to the island with friends. I think my expectations were far greater however, and sadly this meant I was left slightly disappointed. Having said that, I am very pleased we took the afternoon to visit the World Heritage Site and put ourselves in the shoes of prisoners.In fact, one's guide is a former inmate of the prison. Ours was passionate & informative. He had the unique ability to get you to empathise with him as he transported you back to the harsh realities of prison life. This part of the tour is the reason I have given 4 stars to the experience because I believe this is what it is about - to get visitors to understand, reflect, empathise and walk away with confidence in knowing just how far South Africa has come.And of course there is Mandela's prison cell which has its own unique ambience or 'presence' as it were. I would've liked to have spent more time there to experience the solitude, but mass tourism is unfortunate in that way - it does not afford time.I would recommend people to go. Would I go again? Probably not.TOP TIPS: the views across the bay of Cape Town and Table Mountain from the island are unrivalled. You can also send yourself a postcard from the island's post office which is franked with its own Robben Island stamp."

On the island you will go on a 45 minute bus tour with a 15 minute break in the middle. The guide on the bus had little information and the bus was very full. After the bus tour you go on a tour with an ex-prisoner. Again there where way too many people and the prisoner told us only about the basic stuff. Like how many people go in a cell and how they communicated with other prisoners. And he shows you the cell of Mandela. Which looks like any other....There are two boats, a slow one and a fast one. But you have to go back on the boat you came with. But apparently they only told that to the people on the fast boat. So lots of people of the slow boat got in the fast one. Nobody was there to check their tickets... But when the captain found out he let is crew take all the slow-boat-people of this vessel. Even elderly people who had trouble walking and standing on boats. Then the slow boat people had to wait for the slow boat to come and get them. We where back on the shore after 19:00...."

The prison tour was good - the most moving part of it that the tour guide was a former political prisoner. And the visit to Madiba's cell was profoundly moving - like a pilgrimage to the tomb of a saint. I think - and I feel this for the whole future of SA - is that we need a vision of the future based on robust confidence rather than simple celebration of a (remarkable) hero.

The ferries were late out and we were kept sweltering in the 'holding bay' for an extended period of time with no communication. Eventually the boat came and took well over an hour to get to the island. The tour on the bus around the island was so fleeting and rushed and cursory now and the guide very disappointing and robotic. The main focus of the trip seemed to be how many people they could get on and how quickly it could be 'done'.

Our Robben Island trip was the lone awful part of our stay.The trip began with a 30 minute boat ride over the ocean and to the island. At the very worst this could have been a nice relaxing boat excursion -- and at best it could have been an opportunity to get the visitors in the somber mood of the prison they are about to visit. There could have been stories shared of what the prisoners and guards felt as they took the long boat ride to isolation. \"COULD HAVE BEEN\". What was it in reality?? As I type it i can't even believe it happened. There was an American rap star on our little boat. He gave the captain his CD to play over the boat's loud speakers. So we were treated to 30 minutes of loud rap of the worst kind, with profanity, and references too vulgar to repeat in this space. After passengers complained, on the return trip they played \"ambiance music\" -- some ridiculous background music, also with singing etc. Just dumb and ruined the experience of the cruise. The ocean is background music enough.The next part of the trip was the bus tour of the island. The guide was pathetic. Most of the bus tour was spent making lame jokes and playing off the visitor's countries of origin. There was NO information shared about life on the island that I didn't already know from reading 2 paragraphs in my guide book. We stopped to walk around near a gift shop and to take pictures of Table Mountain. LAME. And again, a wasted opportunity to actually educate the tourists. Nelson Mandela is obviously the reason why people come to Robben Island. The guide called Mandela \"One of a kind\" and \"a great great man\" and \"a giant.\" All cliches, but I left with not one new insight into what actually made him great, or how his stay at the Island influenced him.The third part was the tour of the prison led by a former prisoner. Now the idea of former prisoners leading tours of the prison is brilliant. But just because you were arrested 40 years ago for fighting apartheid doesn't mean you're qualified to be a tour guide!!! The man was very difficult to understand, spoke in generalities, shared little of his own experience, and just looked like someone who was bored to be there. There was another tour group with a guide that sounded more interesting and professional, and we wanted to join that group instead but weren't sure if their tour was already ending or just beginning. Overall, this was just a disgrace. You have thousands of captive visitors on this tour, eager to learn about South Africa and to experience its intense history on an emotional personal level. Instead they are taken on this tacky tip-hungry tour that teaches absolutely nothing. We spoke to others and it seems that the quality of guides is highly uneven, and you might get lucky with better guides. Which is really a shame since all of us visitors have a limited time in Cape Town and wasting the afternoon with the awful guides we had is really upsetting. Train the guides who want to be there, and fire the rest...... and if you can't fire them because they are former prisoners and ANC members... well then write them a good compelling script to memorize."

It would have been nice to have spoken to him, and from my research, this prison warden works on the island now and I am sure he would have taken questions.Also, we did not get to view Robert Sobukwe prison cell but we had seen other tours jumping off and viewing it.The second part of the trip was interesting - our guide was an ex political prisoner - it was interesting to hear what he went through and and the people he met and about life in general at Robben Island.A highlight from the day was that 14 couples got married on the 14 of Feb at Robben Island - it was lovely seeing all the couples in their bridal garments."

However, as the attraction is immensely popular, strongly buying your tickets on-line before depart for Cape Town. The ferry to the island leaves from a complex in the Victoria and Albert Waterfront. The departure terminal includes a small museum. Upstairs, the museum details the involvement of the Irish opposing apartheid, while downstairs in the departure terminal, there is a very interesting display on the history of Robben Island. Unfortunately, we could not look at this display as the staff kept us constrained in an area where we couldn't really read the exhibit properly. The ferry ride is a short, 30 minute, ride out to the island. There, you board busses for a guided tour around the island. Our tour guide was awesome and provided an interesting glimpse into life on the island, both today and in the past. After the tour ride, we were escorted into the prison building itself for a face-to-face tour with an ex-inmate of Robben Island. I had high hopes for this part of the program, but was disappointed. The tour group I was with numbered around fifty. They placed us in one of the large rooms where inmates lived and spoke with us for about 30 minutes. He was difficult to hear due to the size of the room. Afterwards, we walked through the high-value prisoner court yard and the wing where Nelson Mandela was kept. We were able to view his cell.I think that there was a great deal of opportunity for a more historical experience at this venue. Rather I found the displays and information, other than our tour driver, to be somewhat sparse.Of note, the tour does circle the island and at one point you can exit and take some photos of a spectacular view of Cape Town and Table Mountain.Robben Island should be on the itinerary for any visitor to Cape Town, but temper your expectations."

I had to buy my ticket on Friday to travel on Sunday - it was fully booked until then. I presented myself at 10.30 (for the 11 o'clock trip), and stood in line for ages while the surly staff scanned barcodes and scanned your bag. Eventually got onto a rickety old wooden boat, and there were no seats, so had to perch on a corner in the blazing sunshine for the 45 minute boat ride. Not a great start.Got off the boat and we all had to get on a bus. After 5 minutes on the bus, we all had to get off to visit the refreshment hut! We then got back on the bus, and the interesting guide pointed things out to us through the windows. We weren't allowed to get off. so no pictures could be taken, which was a shame.After the bus, I thought the best part of the trip was to come - the ex-prisoner guide. Alas, all he did was ask everyone (all 50 people in the group) where they came from. It was such a tedious waste of a precious 5 minutes where we should have been hearing tales of the past. He also waffled on about lots of other things that had nothing to do with Robben Island, and he shouted at us like he was leading a protest march! The most poignant part should have been seeing Nelson Mandela's cell, but he spent another 5 minutes waffling on about goodness knows what, then said - \"oh, here's the cell that was used by Mandela\". We all then had to quickly file past the cell taking a quick snap each as there were 50 people in the group. No time to reflect, nothing.After visiting Alcatraz in the past, I expected atmosphere and time to walk around on your own to really get a feel for the place, but instead we were herded along and then had to run to catch the ferry back. No time for reflection. Very disappointed. Be aware too that the ferries never run on time - We were due back at 14.30, but actually arrived back at 15.15, and apparently the 11.00 tour is the one with the shortest delays!

This is after all where the late Mr Mandela and many others who wanted a democratic SA suffered for so many years and one is overwhelmed by those thoughts as a South African. However, it's about the whole experience. First, I was given false information about the running of the Sikhululekile ferry. Twice I contacted the offices, once through Cape Town Tourism at the airport and once personally. I was assured the ferry as stipulated on our tickets is running. It was not. Our 09:00 \"ferry\" left 50 mins. late with one unclear announcement made by staff about a 15 min. delay. No regular communication; you are just left there in the queue. Had to also wait for a boat once we wanted to leave the island. Nothing was on schedule and consequently we had to cancel other planned activities. The guide we had on the bus ride on the island was really knowledgable and a lovely warm person. It was also very special to be led through the cells by an ex-prisoner, but this was so rushed and he never made sure that his group was with him or that we could all hear what he was saying. I expected so much more. I wonder if Robben Island museum read these reviews? Do they care about us as visitors? Of course, one MUST visit Robben Island non-withstanding my complaints! It is very special."

We had so many great facts about the island, wildlife, and was very personable. We even Our guide for the prison was Sparks. He was a former inmate and was the kindest man.

After reading previous reviews and feedback from others staying at our digs we made sure to get on the 11am trip and no later.I have to agree that with others that there is something lacking with the trip. I felt the boat trip was basically a ferry. Did not feel like it was part of the trip as the crew were not interested in the passengers. Loads of1990s music was played which for us was good as it was our coming of age but for the older generation (mostly fresh off the Queen Mary 2) they expected some commentary.We were very lucky with our your guides they were great!We were on the first bus and the tour of the island was very informative to get a background into what life was like for both the inmates and the staff who stayed there and the families who are living there presently. There was a 10 minute stop off which was long enough before heading back across the island to the limestone quarry before disembarking for the prison tour.Our tour guide was Glen. We feel very humbled to have met him after hearing his story of his stay in the prison.On both tours it was interesting to hear of the history of Mandela and the other inmates and what life was like for them.The walk to freedom had an eery feel about it when you knew you walking in famous footsteps and how they must have felt when they knew they were finally leaving the prison and the island.We had to giggle when Glen told us that one of the first things they did was head to KFC for a feed and when TV eventually arrived at the Prison the Bold and the Beautiful was the favourite TV Show."

Our guide ('MP') on the 45 minute bus tour in rather dilapidated bus, was very friendly and informative. However, this section of the trip was disappointing as, besides a 15 minute 'scenic stop' at the end of the island opposite Table Mountain, it was difficult to see many of the things talked about clearly: it was no opportunity to get out of the bus and it was impossible to take photographs unless you were next to a window (tip: if you absolutely must have photos of the visit - sit next to an open window - if you go as a couple take two cameras and sit on different sides of the bus).The second 45 minute leg of the trip was a guided tour around the security wing where Mandela and the other political prisoners were held. Our guide (unfortunately I've forgotten his name) was an ex-political prisoner held there from the early 1980s. He was both entertaining and very informative, with personal anecdotes that help understand how the prisoners got round the restrictions imposed upon them. He also gave an insight into the thinking that went into planning the anti-apartheid campaign.Was the visit worth it? Yes, if only because of what the place represents. However, the visit felt very rushed and groups too large, with no time to reflect while at the location of the enormity of what incarceration meant and the courage with which the prisoners faced it. There is definitely a feeling of 'maximising tourist throughput', with little investment in facilities or staff that the excursion clearly generates. This risks devaluing the significance of the place as a symbol. Many visitors may be happy with the format of the tour, but why not offer a tour for smaller groups who would appreciate more time and the opportunity to walk around the site and please invest some of the money generated by the excursion into maintaining and upgrading the equipment and facilities."

We did the 9am trip to Robben Island, which although was sold out and we had to buy tickets in advance, we were pleasantly surprised to find that the boat was not overly crowded and there was enough room. The boat trip took about 45 minutes, giving a fantastic view of Cape Town and Table Mountain, as we got further from shore. We also saw dolphins swimming alongside the boat. The trip was well organised and coaches were waiting for us upon arrival at the Island. The guide on the coach was very good and gave us lots of useful information. After the tour around the Island, we had a guided tour of the maximum security prison, by one of the ex prisoners which was very interesting. He did however over run on time, so when we got back to the boat, the crew were in a rush to leave. Some people who didn't seen in a rush to get back to the boat, ended up missing this boat back.Overall a very enjoyable visit to Robben Island. Its worth booking in advance if you can as this trip is popular and does get sold out."

Our tour left on time, the boat ride over was the low light of the trip--200 some odd school children snacking--then puking--the smell was horrific but that was where the bad ended. Once on the island we were taken on a quick 1 hour tour of the island--stopping and getting the history of each building, the graveyard, the quarry, lighthouse, etc. We were able to get out of the bus at 3 stops and take mini tours of specific areas--amazing history lesson. Finally, we were returned to the prison area where we met our guide Sparks, a prisoner who spent considerable time in the prison, along with Nelson Mandela. The guides were all prisoners or guards and so they have the first hand experiences to provide insight that some hired guide doesn't have. For what our guide went through it was moving to hear him speak in such a deep and powerful voice, telling his story, the story of the people he was imprisoned with, and Nelson Mandela.There's not much else to say--the island is a major historical site and one that shouldn't be missed. Not just for Africa, but the world. What happened here was an injustice not just for the people imprisoned, but an entire race. The major takeaway form the Sparks that I got was, sharing what happened is important so we don;t repeat those mistakes--something we still haven't learned, and that continually needs to be reinforced."

When we got to his cell we were not told anything about at all just told this was his cell and you can take a picture.

This was my third trip to Robben Island and I am afraid it was a huge disappointment as it did an injustice to a place that is sanctified and should be treated with respect and dignity. The tour of the prison, which was conducted by an ex-prisoner, was rushed and information provided was minimal compared to my previous visits. He lacked conviction and spoke more about his personal life than providing valuable information linked to prison life. I even noted that he quoted statistics that were incorrect. At the cell of Nelson Mandela, the only item that was highlighted was the bucket used as a toilet. I felt saddened for first time for first time visitors who would have left the island with no lasting impression of the severity of the prison or the significance that it should hold today.The second part of the tour was also a little disappointing. As we left the prison we drove past the leper cemetery, which the tour guide promised to discuss at a later stage. We stopped for a photo and refreshment opportunity in the village and after a circular tour arrived at Robert Sobukwe\u2019s prison house. On the tour, information provided was scant except for the waffling of the guide after our visit to the Sobukwe house for 15 odd minutes. We drove to the limestone quarry and again the significance of the lime quarry was not really highlighted. Here, our guide focused more on the visit by ex-prisoners in the 2000s\u2019. I was particularly shocked by the guides\u2019 reference to policy linked to gratuities on the way back to the harbour and the fact that these could be given, preferably in foreign currency. We, once again, drove past the leper cemetery and other important places, such as the Muslim Shrine or Moturu Kramaon the island without any mention of them whatsoever. The Robben Island tour ended and left me with a feeling of profound sorrow and disappointment. I can genuinely say that the guides provided little additional insight into this world heritage site and I felt embarrassed by their lack of genuine interest and sincerity with regards to the severity and significance of this place of deep reflection. Robben Island embodies the struggle against Apartheid and its consequences, provides proof of the suffering and somehow gives all South Africans a sense of pride for the victory that was achieved. Robben Island is the ultimate South African memorial site and should be the number one tourist destination in our country."

Our boat was on schedule with the 1-hour ride to the island - we had one of the newer boats so we sat on the upper deck and enjoyed the ride while taking pictures of Table Mountain in the distance. Upon arrival at the island, we were boarded into 3 waiting buses for a ride around the island which included the lepers graveyard, the prisoners church, the guards church, the post office, the lime quarry, an Islamic shrine and Robert Sobukwe's house where he was held in solitary confimement. Our bus guide was youthful and very passionate about his work explaining the suffering faced by the freedom fighters.We were then handed over to the ex-prisoner called Itumeleng who gave us a briefing about his experiences in the prison and the predicament of the political leaders who were detained at the prison. It was quite an experience walking through the Cell Blocks including the yard and the prison cell where Nelson Mandela was held for 18 of his 27 years in prison - quite a sobering experience.We then took the short 300 metre walk back to the harbour straight into the waiting boat for our return journey back to V&A. The retrun boat was however older and the waters choppier in our return 1-hour trip but we made it back by 6.30pm.After reading the challenges faced by other reviewers, I guess we were very lucky to have had such a smooth trip to and from the island. We booked our ticket online 2 months prior to arrival in Cape Town and were lucky that the weather was perfect for the trip with clear blue sunny skies.This trip really gives you an insight into the pre-independence struggle by the freedom fighters and its an experience not to be missed while in Cape Town."

One of the highlights of our trip just days after the death of Madiba...... despite a shambolic transportation issue which caused a delay - once we got to the island the tour was excellent. The bus tour gave a good overview and then the tour of the prison with an ex-political prisoner was powerful and moving. Walking past Mandelas cell where a single candle burned touched me. Good gift shop on the quay to browse in while waiting for next boat. They need to sort out the transportation issues and then it would be perfect."

And apart from a slightly chaotic start to the tour with allocating the coaches, generally the whole visit lived up to or exceeded this beginning.We began with a coach tour of the island. This included seeing the area where Robert Sobukwe was kept in solitary confinement. We drove through the 'town' previously inhabited by the guards and now home to the island workers. We parked by the lime quarry to see the \u201cUniversity of Robben Island\u201d where many of the illiterate prisoners became educated. As the sun glanced off the rock, I could appreciate how the brutally long days, breaking rocks, with no protection against the African sun as it reflected off the white rock, had permanently damaged Mandela\u2019s eyesight. In the middle of the quarry is the Reunion Cairn, that symbolises South Africans diversity. The impromptu memorial was created in 1995 when Nelson Mandela laid a stone in the quarry where he had once been put to hard labour, a gesture followed by the more than 1,000 former political prisoners who were on Robben Island with him for a reunion. After this we met up with Glen Kaotso Ntsoelengoe, the political prisoner who took us into a large cell to tell us his story. He explained why and how he agreed to return to the island where he was once tortured and incarcerated. He was more than willing to answer our questions, and discuss the current political situation. It was gratifying to sense his commitment had not diminished in spite of his treatment by the previous regime. Finally he took us around the rest of the prison, enabling us to visit the cell block and courtyard where Mandela was kept. Standing outside the 2.4-by-2.1-metre cell where Madiba spent 18 of his 28 years in prison with nothing but a straw mat to sleep on was moving. But equally if not more so was the other cells where you could see pictures of the many people captured and read first hand accounts of their experiences - including instances of torture .It took a while for us to absorb the impact of our visit, to be able to speak. But I do wonder how future generations, those who'll not have the benefit of a tour guide who lived alongside Madiba and who survived their imprisonment, will experience Robben Island. I for one am glad to have visited while Mandela was still alive and to have had the honour to meet a survivor."

The ferry we were initially booked on (11:00 a.m.) was overbooked and we had to wait for an extra 45 minutes only to be taken aboard the Dias, an old ship that the prisoners used to be transferred with (the passengers on our initially confirmed transfer travelled on a new vessel). I believe that in Western Europe the ship would not have qualified as seaworthy. The experience on the island itself was quite ok - both guides were highly motivated and very knowledgeable. The return from the island also proved difficult as there was no ship ready to take us back to Cape Town after the tour. Passengers had to self-organize the return trip, as the official boat would have arrived only 1.5 hours after the end of the tour\u2026 A shame that the management of the Robben Island Museum is not up to par."

Prepare to bear the South Atlantic swells on your half hour boat ride to Robben Island, hoping that the clapped-out boats don't pack up en route. It's not perhaps the most well organised tour you'll take in the world, but it's certainy one of the most moving and most inspiring.It comes in three parts - the boat trip (yes, it's two way but treated as one here), the coach ride, and the prison tour. Of the three the prison tour, by a former inmate is the most moving. Our guy was fantastic. Of course the smells and fears of the former prison have gone, but he gave you a sense of what it must have been like to have been incarcerated there under a cruel regime. One of the most unusual prisons too as the inmates were mostly political, and what you come away with is the sense of commuity and humanity each gave to each other. You will also see the cell once occupied by one of the most famous men on the planet. Thus bus tour of the island is a little odd, or at least ours was, as the guide (a different one from the prison tour) was of lesser quality and tried much too hard to be funny. You see the lime quarry where hard labour was done, perhaps the best bit of it, but can't help feeling it's a bit of a time filler.The organisation is rather poor and indeed a little chaotic, and badly needs investment. One thing they should improve is the boat trip. The boats are old and need replacing; the silly group photos taken on boarding just annoyed people and caused large queues, and the heavy loud music on the return trip was out of keeping and unnecessary. Allow four hours in total."

Certainly if you want to feel exploited, trapped and angry at the system then you're in for a treat if you catch this tour on one its lesser days - which we did. Checking-in for the 9am tour we were told every 40 minutes that there would be a 20 minute delay, an experience which continued until 11am. Local guides waiting with their tours told us this was an embarrassingly regular occurrence as the operator's ferries regularly broke down and no contingency is ever in place.While we left the 10am group up in arms following the brazen cancellation of their tour (\"You can request a refund or re-book on another available tour... in two weeks time\"); we shipped out.The island is interesting, the stories it holds from its history equally so, the way in which it is presented leaves a lot to be desired. The bus tour to a handful of sites could be covered in half the time, particularly if the unnecessary stop at a concession store at the end of the island is cut out. As a captive audience - you are also a captive market on this one.The bus guide, while friendly, was woefully inept in her dulled textbook delivery of jokes and sadly remained poorly understood by most tourists when she chose to present facts.At the prison buildings themselves, ex-captives thankfully take over to deliver the tour. Peppered with personal experiences and anecdotes, this part is worth the pain to get to it. Unfortunately, because you have spent so much time faffing around prior to this, there's barely time to take-in the cells you are shown and the information on display in them. We're rushed through, and then on to Mandella's block, filed past his cell and before we know it, we're walking back to the ferry port where dis-organisation resumes, ironically, quite efficiently. No one quite knows which boat they're catching and it's another frustratingly long wait under the sun for a ride back to port. Reaching there at 4pm - it's been a 7 hour trip in total. \"Do please buy the photo of your group boarding the Robben Island ferry\" - we would if we thought the money was being better spent and not lining pockets."

Being in South Africa when Nelson Mandela passed away was something we will never forget. It was a joyous celebration of an amazing life, not a morbid sombre atmosphere as it would probably have been at home. From looking at these reviews we were very lucky to get a bright December day with a calm gentle sea on our way to the Island, although coming back was certainly a little more choppy and we were quite glad to get off. However the sea would no way have stopped us from getting over to feel for ourselves a piece of history.We were blown away by everything we learnt and it was an honour to spend some time with someone who actually lived it. You get a real feel for how bleak it must have been there and it made us think long and hard about how we would have felt about and reacted to the plight of the men imprisoned there (we were very small children at the time). It certainly enhanced our trip to South Africa as a whole. Standing outside Mandela's cell was a chance to reflect on how easily we huff and puff about our lives and blame others for the situation we are in, rather than getting on and doing something about it. It was just a shame I was forcibly shoved to the side after 20 seconds by a girl who was more interested in snapping a picture than in remembering why she was there.Yes the shop makes it all feel a bit touristy and the bus tour was a little bit military but I don't think there would be any other way to allow people to see the island without ruining it. Even in the one place we were allowed off the coach some people from the group crossed a boundary line and trod over ground with protected birds nesting, despite strict instructions from our guide. If silly people behave like that, how could the island survive an onslaught of wanderers??!!Definitely worth braving the sea sickness to go."

Despite a real pea-souper, we were on the island in about 30 minutes having passed by the odd seal, a dolphin or two and lots of penguins.We took the bus tour first which was both informative and touching. The guide had the right amount of humour and was perfectly able to manage the time well. A lady was taken poorly so a detour to the clinic was organised with care and compassions. No complaints.The walking tour with a former prisoner was something else. I felt his pain as he told his story. Yes, lots of people on the tour but I got to hear/see everything to 'get' some of the story.A short walk back to the boat and it was only inconsiderate fellow passengers who made us late. All in all, a great excursion and well worth the time and money."

However, in doing so, the visit is a catalogue of woes, inefficiency and commercialism. The ferry service suffers from major delays and long waits, irrespective of the actual booking time on tickets - which is totally irrelevant. Worse, on arrival, one is corralled onto buses for a \"tour\" of the island which takes an hour but can be seen in minutes....were it not for a horrendous guide who emulates the worst of standup comedians, combined with tour guides. Only after his request for gratuities, are you finally escorted to prison buildings. The tour is hosted by a former inmate, who is moving and articulate, albeit a little long. In the process, only a few minutes are spent around the highlight of tour.....the cell of former President Mandela. At this point, desperation sets in and one is tempted to seek any mode of transportation back to shore......sadly, another wait for the ferry. In total, the entire process took FIVE hours....an unthinkable amount of time and solely the result of outright commercialism of the hallowed memory of a great man. A strong argument can be made for skipping the tour, buying the book and donating the balance of the ticket money to a worthy cause."

I've read the negative reviews about old boats and problems due to weather with great sadness because to me, Robben Island isn't about being a \"tourist attraction\" per se. Yes, I can certainly understand how disappointing it must be to have the trip cancelled (due to whatever) when you have limited time and many things to do. But Robben Island is a place that is holy to me and to many others. It is a place to reflect on man's cruelty to man, on what freedom means, and, ultimately, on the marvel of forgiveness. Each tour is led by former inmates of the Island, so I am not be surprised that there's variation between them. The times that I've been out have been very inspiring. The first time, I didn't know that much about Nelson Mandela and the visit made me delve much more deeply into South African history, including reading a number of important books (\"Long Walk to Freedom\", \"Country of My Skull,\" etc) and seeing several movies (Mandela and deKlerk being perhaps the most relevant) I am certain that it has had similar impacts on others. That makes it a very important experience in my book.If you've tried to go and not been able to do so, please please please try again the next time you're in Cape Town! It took me 3 different attempts before getting the right weather- and time-window - but it is completely worth it!Given Madiba's death and the current situation in South Africa, it seems even more important to me to make this journey open-heartedly and open-mindedly. It certainly isn't an \"attraction\" like Disneyworld! It is a commemorative journey to a holy place where forgiveness emerged as central to the history of this great country."

After that we had to dash back to the ferry, which was my only disappointment as both my guide book and the bus guide recommended seeing \"Section A: cell stories\" at the prison and there was no time.

After arriving in the country we received an email that our tour was cancelled and to contact the office. We had contacted the office who took down our information and we were told we would receive a call which we never did, which was a bad sign of customer service and received no explanation, We had followed up and were informed that the tickets were now sold out for that date but to stop by in person at the ticket office. We did that and were informed there were only tickets available from January 7 on. Unfortunately we will no longer be in the country at that point. I understand there are technical glitches, however there needs to be some process and controls in order to deal with these situations. It seems unfair to cancel a ticket and not try have a replacement ship for those people affected. We also heard that there have been issues with the vendor that the kusum was contracting out as their own boats were having issues. Many people visiting are not from the country and will not have an opportunity to see such a special sight again. Also, I noticed that in the line next to me at the ticket office was another person having an issue in regards to their tickets and the customer service representative was not nice to them, while the customer was being pleasant.

There was a queue to almost out the door and this was the 2:30 boat passengers. After sitting outside until 3pm we returned to the building. Still a queue. We joined the queue and waited and waited to get on a boat. There was a lady's who seemed to be in charge making announcements about bearing with her and being patient. Eventually we were placed on a boat. A slow boat.The boat journey takes around 30-45 mins. Upon arriving to Robben Island we are ushered onto old coaches. Each coach has a tour guide, who to give credit to him, was enthusiastic and animated but sadly he did nothing to lift spirits. The bus is a little bit of a nonsense journey with not much in participial being shown. A view point, which was smelly and not that pretty, the quarry and the one single small prison. Eventually you are let off the coach only to do another guided tour of the actual prison. This was given by an ex prisoner which is a nice touch, but like some other reviews on here, he had a stony South African accent and coupled with the echoey rooms was quite hard to understand.Anyway, to the end of the trip. You must queue and wait for the return boats. More waiting. Eventually everyone is on a boat (I need to add that they are over capacity, not enough seats for everyone). Boat journey back was very rocky and rough. None was allowed out their seats (the ones who had seats!).All in all a very badly designed experience. Robben Island needs to take a visit to Alcatraz and learn how it's done properly. I would advise all to avoid this tourist attraction until it is better managed. If ever....."

The contemporary historical relevance of this island in our South Africa's make-up is irrefutable and we deemed it certainly worth visiting/experiencing. We so wanted to go but then....An expensive trip and a major disappointment. The whole Robbers Island (sic) thing is a loosely facilitated (will hate to use the word organized) mincing machine smelling of financial greed. This goes for both sides of the crossing by boat (no, not a ferry) and especially the boat trip itself - safety here seemingly NOT a primary consideration.The only bit of interest in an otherwise \"yawn\" was some charming anecdotes from an unfortunately (mostly) unintelligible guide in the Maximum Security Jail. Regrettably and inappropriately he intertwined his pearls of recollection with unmasked (seemingly personal and very skewed) political propaganda and vicious racist remarks bordering on slander - certainly not doing the SA history nor the Madiba legacy any favours. An afternoon - in the splendour of Cape Town - wasted and regrettably so, my family being subjected twice to 50 minute long crossings of the open sea, totally exposed to the sun and other elements (many people, including ourselves, were for instance soaked on the return trip) in relative dangerous conditions due to the type of boats and the condition these were in. A visit to Robben Island can be one of the most valuable and treasured experiences of a SOuth African tour - it has all the makings and it is already \"there\", it is already on the map, it is already internationally (historically) renowned. People are willing to pay for this experience - put the money to better use and shape up Robben Island! With a little organization and cleaning-up this can be a visit of a lifetime. As it is now - Again? Recommended?? No ways."

The staff on the island spoke very highly of the man who had been the first president of the new South Africa and spoke proudly of the endeavours that he had achieved through his lifetime. The actual visit was very informative as was the visit to the cell block that was Mr. Mandela's home for so many years although I suspect that the block was not as warm and inviting during his detention. Altogether a good visit well worth the 215 Rand which included a 45 minute ferry journey."

It serves as a backdrop for the history of African resistance to the evils of the Aparthied system imposed upon them, and is a tribute to the decency of Nelson Mandela and other freedom fighters and members of the African National Congress. Our guide inside the prison walls was a very articulate African man who had served prison time with Mandela, and he was able to describe prison life there based on his own personal experiences. The guide didn't mention this, but Americans might recall that Ronald Reagan as well as many USA banks and corporations embraced the past Apartheid regimes. RR, himself, termed the non-violent Mandela a \"communist\" and a \"terrorist.\" Definitely pre-purchase tickets, which can be done easily on-line or from your hotel. Board the boat first for access to the limited number of seas on the upper deck on a sunny day."

Having our tickets pre purchased, we arrived very early at the boarding place to get our bearings with the intention of heading back to the waterfront. People were already queueing to board for what we assumed was our departure time so we decided to wait for fear of not getting on board. There was little information available and no staff to ask. The crossing was fine and we transferred to waiting buses. We were a party of three and had to stick close as we were being guided onto buses without knowing how many seats, if any were available. The tour guide on the bus was very good and we kept stopping en route so he could deliver his narration.Soon we were handed over to an ex-prisoner whose passionate description of life in the jail was captivating and deeply moving. This was disrupted by two women in their late 20's who felt it was o.k. to sit giggling. It was obviously annoying and embarrassing to the rest of the attentive audience. Gratefully, they were addressed directly by the guide. The party had to move along fairly quickly and many of us lost photo opportunities as there is always someone who hogs the viewpoint! Maybe the guide should have stayed to keep people moving from the rear? This is certainly no place for disruptive adults or children. The arrangement for the boat home was a little disorganised. We were told we had to be at the port at 5 sharp or miss the boat and with a short time available did not get to look around the outside of the prison. It's quite a walk to the boat. We queued for a good half hour in the cold in a very unordered manor as the boat was late!! Summing up, the visit was well worth it but a little attention to the organisation of the transport would reap great rewards."

The place holds an extremely important position in South African history. It was this that made me plan specifically for a visit to Robben Island. Our ferry scheduled to leave at 3:00 p.m. ultimately left at 3:40 p.m. Of course there were regular announcements about the delay, but my 5-year old daughter soon grew quite restless. The journey by ferry was quite okay. But the ferry actually does not have sufficient seats to seat all passengers. So quite a few passengers were left standing. A tip - please use sunscreen, goggles and a good round hat as the sun could be quite punishing. Once we landed on the island, we were ushered onto waiting buses to be taken for an island tour. Fortunately there were sufficient buses to seat all travelers. The guide on the bus spoke English with a thick African accent but it was easy to understand. The bus tour lasted for about 15 to 20 minutes wherein the guide explained the significance of the various buildings including living quarters on the island. We disembarked the bus near the maximum security prison. There, another guide, an ex-prisoner himself took us inside the maximum security prison and showed us the cells where prisoners were held. Cell no.4 held the maximum attention of everyone - it was whee Mandela spent 17 years on this island. It was a sombre moment especially given the fact that he had just passed away. After the tour, it was time to board the ferry for the return journey. The return journey was more pleasant as the sun had almost set - it was very cool and windy! The island is definitely worth a visit for its historical significance."

In the morning the ladies in the office called twice to confirm that all is good and that we will go out. At no point did they tell us that the one boat was broken down and that we will be delayed.When I arrived with the group at 2:45pm we took our place in the queue and waited. Just before 3pm boarding started and we heard from other passengers that it is only the 2pm group that is boarding now.I went to the information desk only to be told we will leave at 4pm.I informed the group as such and all went shopping.Just before we left I checked with info again and this time I was told that it could be earlier and it could be later. We were not told that we should keep our place in the queue nor were we told that they are using a smaller vessel.So, within 45 minutes we saw a boat come and we all rushed to get on it. The queue was too long and we did not make it on.At the end it took us two hours before we departed!!!When we got to the island I was so embarrassed when the people started to comment about the condition the place is in!When on of them asked the guide why they do not paint the place the reply was \"we want to keep the old time feel of the place... the way it was when the prisoners were here!\"I have seen many current prisons. It is maintained very well and I do not think it would have been dilapidated under correction services' use!!!The guides did not give much information and were sometimes contradicting each other.Overall it was just a bad experience!The shop was very EXPENSIVE!!!"

Try to get a seat up top (they fill up fast) where you can sit and enjoy the view. Once you get to the Island you will be there for about two hours. First, you explore the prison in the company of an ex-prisoner who talked about his treatment, his life as an anti-apartheid campaigner, and what life was like in the prison as he shows you around. You get a chance to see Mandela's old cell. Then a bus takes you around the island where you see various attractions, including the old village and the rock quarry where the prisoners worked.

The last trip was average but I decided to give it another try to allow my boyfriend a chance to visit as well.We went out of our way to be booked on the Sikhululekile since the last time I had went many had become sea sick within the Susan Kruger. Everything pointed to being on the Sikhululekile - the booking site, the receipt, the confirmation email. Low and behold when we begin boarding we are all herded onto the tiny Susan Kruger. Many people were disgruntled that we were not placed on the boat which we had chosen to be on yet there was no mention of why this had occurred. The only memorable thing about the Susan Kruger is that it was a ship once used to transport prisoners to the island which gives a unique historical view. However, it is lacking in appropriate transportation for such a large group of visitors.Upon arriving, we were yelled at constantly for being late even though the reason for being late was that the museum staff did not start the boarding process until 30 minutes past the normal boarding time. There were also not enough buses for us so we were instructed to stand around and wait. Luckily, our bus guide was there to give us some neat information while we waited. He instructed us to sit at the picnic tables to rest and wait but when the first picnic table became overcrowded and we moved over to the next table (well within ear shot) he made us move back to stand beside the other. The bus tour was somewhat nice. It was a smaller bus so we were able to be more comfortably seated and we were allowed to disembark twice - once at the Sobukwe house and once at the old pub. However, there were many spots along the way which had signage and patches (such as the quarry) which there was no mention of an option to stop. Why have the signs there if visitors cannot read them or even visit?The worst part of the trip was the prison tour - which should be considered a highlight for everyone. The bus guide had all 50+ of us follow along with one tour guide. Within the group cell, we could barely hear him because multiple families were allowing their kids to run up and down the cell stomping their feet. The tour guide would have to try to yell over them and eventually would stop talking when they did this. The whole experience was quickly ruined by the young kids. The guide would also leave behind the last of the group and begin talking when half of us were far away from hearing him so half of what he said we never heard. As other reviewers mentioned, we were herded along like cattle.Suggestions:Possibly impose an age restriction on tours where babies and young toddlers are not allowed. Many other professional tours and facilities do this. Limit the size of the tours at any given time. The tour guides certainly cannot handle 50+ groups and it is much less enjoyable when no one can hear or see anything.Run the better ferries which make the trip more of a leisurely trip rather than a sea-sickness disaster."

Sadly there were several things wrong with the tour. Firstly, the coach part of it was too long. Secondly, when the guide on the coach handed over the party to an ex-political prisoner for the jail part of the tour we were still a coach load of about 40. This is far too big a group for any guide to address properly. Twenty would be a reasonable size.One of the party had to ask the guide not to recommence speaking until the rear of the group had caught up. Surely one of the cardinal rules of showing a group around anything is to make it possible for all of them to hear you. Get in the middle of them, not at the head of the group. Together with his thick South African accent and the echo in some of the corridors and rooms he showed us, it make it almost impossible for me to hear what he was saying. Those familiar with the South African accent may have found him easier to understand. I fear that anyone whose mother tongue is not English would gain even less than I did from this tour, other than to be able to say \"I have been there.'' When the party reached Mandela's cell, the place most visitors came to see, there was indecent haste to take one photo and move on.The tour would be improved considerably by issuing visitors with audio devices on which a commentary was available. There will come a time when ex-inmates will be unable to conduct tours."

This was our first trip to South Africa and we were keen to include a trip to Robben Island while we were staying in Cape Town.This is an island off the coast of Cape Town and is most famous for being a prison for political prisoners in the apartheid era.

We got there soon after 8:30am and it's just as well that we got there early so we could get a good seat on the ferry. There was a long queue - mainly because we all had to pass through security before boarding.The ferry holds about 300 people and the trip to the island takes about 30 minutes. After getting off the ferry, they loaded us onto buses for a 45-minute drive around the island stopping at places of interest. The final destination was the former maximum security prison.Here our guide was a former prisoner who had been held for five years for plotting a demonstration against apartheid. He took us from one wing to another relating personal stories of the hardships they endured.At one stage, he stopped outside the cell where Nelson Mandela was held for 18 of the 27 years that he spent in prison. As with the other cells, it was very small and basic.We could walk from the maximum security prison to the ferry and we were back at the Cape Town waterfront at about 12:30pm.It was a worthwhile and memorable morning. Because it's such a popular tour, it was quite crowded and perhaps somewhat rushed."

During the second part of the trip you see the cells. The second guide is a former prisoner. Unfortunately it was difficult to understand him and he told the story a little monotone.

You will feel rushed to return to the boat. Don't worry, there will be another one unless it is the last boat of the day. Our ex-prisoner tour guide (Unfortunately don't remember his name) was almost impossible to understand (my fault because I don't speak his language) due to his accent so a lot of information was missed.

I was expecting a tiny island with one prison but there is a small community there.The ex-inmate guide in the prison spoke too long about Apartheid and not long enough about life in the prison etc. We had literally two seconds each to take a picture/look at Mandela's cell which is probably the highlight of the trip. Then the boat back was held up again, for twenty five minutes. Yes it's a 'must do' but I didn't really enjoy being herded around like sheep on a 'sausage machine-like' tour.

Visiting Robben Island appears to be must for every tourist visiting Cape Town, if the numbers of people on the ferry over to the island are any indication. Also, the trips on the ferry (back and forth) are not very pleasant even when you have taken motion sickness tablets, which I would suggest are a must, not an optional extra. Notwithstanding, the on board video is must for watching before you arrive.There is no doubting that a visit to Robben Island has become a \u2018pilgrimage\u2019 for lots of \u2018middle-class\u2019 white people (like me), which is rather ironic when you think about it. That said the tour is a must if you come to Cape Town, though the whole experience of visiting Robben Island could be so much better.Yes, you must get on the bus and see the whole island; and yes, you must do the tour with the former \u2018Robben Island inmate\u2019; but don\u2019t jump straight back on the ferry at the end of the \u2018official tour\u2019 and go back to Cape Town (which was our mistake). Rather, if you want to see Robben Island you need to do some walking \u2013 that is, explore the island by yourself on foot. For example, the bus tour takes you to the lime quarry where Mandela and others worked but you aren\u2019t allowed off the bus!!!! The post office is pointed out (where you can send a postcard with a special Robben Island stamp) but again, you don\u2019t get off the bus. And there is also lots of other history beyond the apartheid years (e.g. World War II) which is only briefly touched on as you race by on the bus tour.The \u2018on-foot tour\u2019 with the former inmate brings the whole visit to the island into sharp focus, though serious thought will need to be given for the future when these icons are no longer available to give their personal first-hand account. While in places (narrow corridors and other confines) it is difficult to hear what the guide is saying, when he sits you down or you are in the open confines of a prison yard the whole sad story is brought all to vividly to life. It is remarkable that it could all be so true\u2026"

For those of my generation who watched from afar, the horrors and injustices of Apartheid, Robben Island is one of the iconic symbols of the man, who through peace and understanding, ended the Apartheid era and avoided a civil war. Nelson Mandela, 466/64, was infamously imprisoned here for most of his 27 years of incarceration before his release and eventual election to President.You will need to book to get on this tour which starts from the Robben Island museum at the Cape Town Waterfront. The short crossing was very smooth despite a stiff breeze. Arriving on the island you board a coach for a tour around part of the island. Our coach guide had quite a sense of humour although her English was a little difficult to understand. It is worth listening carefully to what she has to say.Then to the maximum security prison itself. Our guide here was a former political prisoner himself, one of the last groups of political prisoners to be incarcerated here. We were shown through the various cell blocks and there was plenty of opportunity to see inside the cells and see some of the inscriptions by former detainees. Then to the enclosed area of area B which is a walled courtyard where Nelson Mandela wrote his book 'The long walk to freedom'. It was amazing that he managed to hide the script for the book there although parts were apparently discovered by the authorities. Mr Mandela's actual cell is locked mainly as it would take ages to get everyone through if it was open. but you can see clearly into the cell with its cramped conditions and rudimentary 'comforts'. Other neighbouring cells in the block are open. Nothing I could ever write could describe the complex emotions of having witnessed for a few minutes what others suffered for decades. This trip is most decidedly worth while. As a little aside, I can also recommend seeing the film 'The 16th Man' in which Springbok Rugby players describe their experience of visiting the Island."

I live in South Africa and would probably never have bothered going unless I had a good excuse - such as taking my friends. We booked our tickets online as we'd heard they go quite quickly and set off early in the morning with plenty of time to spare to catch the ferry. Unfortunately we were stuck in traffic for over an hour, arrived 20mins late and begged and pleaded with the ticket counter people to place us on the next tour. They said \"Sorry, you forfeit your ticket and have to pay full price for another tour\" which was extremely disappointing as one ticket is R250 (for 3 of us we ultimately had to pay R1500). I would recommend that you DO NOT book online unless you're staying close to the city center, rather just pitch up and see if you can get a ticket to avoid being ripped off. Also, try to go on a sunny day when there's no fog so that you can get a great photo of Table Mountain and the city from the island (which we couldn't see on our trip).A ferry ride with an introductory video on the history of the island was first. Then we hopped off onto a bus where a very good tour guide told us quite a bit about the island and history. Unfortunately they didn't really give you the option to hop off and take photos, except the once when we could have taken a shot of the mountain (which was blanketed in clouds). Next up was the ex-political prisoner talk, very interesting but also quite long winded as the gentlemen took quite a while to explain things. I think proper trained tour guides would make it a much more meaningful experience, including some more information for tourists to read on parts of the facility. Overall, it was pretty average, and definitely overpriced."

If you honor what this man did with his life before, during and surely after his imprisonment, it is a duty and an obligation to go to visit Robben island. Such a pretty place with so much evil behind it and what makes this visit even more mind boglling is that part of the tour is given by a person (or persons) who were previous prisoners on Robben Island. To have suffferred so much and to still return to show us what happened and how they lived is absolutely amazing. do not miss the chance to go especially is you love and cherish your own life. a visit is good for your historical knowledge and great for your soul!"

Yes it's historic and yes it is moving to see where political prisoners like Mandela where held but the quality of the tour and the information provided compared to other world heritage sites and even other world historical attractions is really really low.If you have been to Alcatraz this doesn't compare in the slightest.There is no option for an audio tour, nothing is made to create the atmosphere or conditions that the prisoners lived in. Someone needs to take a trip to Alcatraz to see the quality that people are expecting and really up their game.It is such a shame that a site of such importance is so poorly presented.Guides are often difficult to understand and if English isn't your first language then you are in trouble.I really wish i was able to give a better review of this trip but seriously spend your time in the museums on the mainland."

The prisoner who was our second guide was a nice man but EXTREMELY difficult to understand, And therefore the tour of the prison was almost a waste of time, with no time to wander about at all. The boat trip back was a mini disaster. Half way back to Cape Town, we turned around and returned to the Island. We waited for a second 'faster' boat. All in all the trip took almost 5 hours, AND it was a huge letdown.Sadly, we would not recommend it. Do some reading instead and use the time for a walking tour of the harbour or downtown area."

Despite warning from my cousin (who lives in Cape Town), we were astounded by how poor the trip was. The bus trip was poorly managed with passengers not allowed to get off to take pictures the majority of the time. The 2 occasions we were allowed off were for 10mins at Sobukwe's 'house' and another 10mins at the cafe to buy snacks and take photos looking back towards Cape Town. In terms of the history of the Island and the maximum security prison, again it was poor. We were taken around by an ex prisoner who, whilst being very sweet, had only been in the prison a few years when he was a teenager. His knowledge of the facts was not impressive and the whole viewpoint is very skewed. We weren't given time to wander around and take the whole place in. The signs were poor and told you very little information. I may be biased having been to Alcatraz over the summer but I was very, very disappointed. They could do so much more to make this interesting and informative. All they need to do is sort out an audio tour for you to take with you!I would suggest the managers take a trip to Alcatraz and see what can be done.......and it's not even a World Heritage site!"

My husband and I visited Robben Island on the 3.30pm ferry on Tuesday 8th October. On disembarking the ferry, we were shepherded onto a bus and brought up to the prison where we took an informal tour with a past political prison. Our guide was very informative, personable and most importantly, spoke slowly and loudly so everyone could hear. He regaled us with tales of prison life, including his leader Nelson Mandela who the prison is famous for. We were shown around the cells, communal rooms, outside space etc of the prison and enjoyed hearing what a day in the life of an inmate was like. It really brought the place to life. After the walking tour, we were shepherded back onto the bus and driven around the island stopping to take photo\u2019s in many of the islands\u2019s most famous spots. I did feel a bit rushed and shepherded everywhere \u2013 however I expect this was because we were the last group of the day and time was tight.

The Ferry itself was more than sufficient and we felt safe and comfortable each way. I would definitely get there early as crowds are more than likely guaranteed, and book ahead of time online. On arrival we were herded onto large buses and taken around the island with a guide. Only stopping to peer out the windows at some places. If you are on the wrong side of the bus for the stop it is sort of tough luck! We got out twice and of course for the important historical part being the main cells. Another guide then took over and presented us with the all important info. that we would expect. But it probably went for just that little too long in the one room. I must say very glad they have not turned this into some fancy overdone tourist attraction and love the fact that it is left raw and relatively untouched. And left with your own presence and thoughts a moving moment. But found the organised tour part and overall experience a little disappointing."

He explained, that he was unable to fully integrate back into \"normal\" society once he was released. It has been therapeutic for him to stay on the island, and conduct tours of the prison, and to tell his story.One definitely gets the idea as to how cruel and inhumane daily life was for a prisoner on this island.The tour of the prison and island takes a couple of hours.

If you are visiting the area and not familiar with the Waterfront, the ferry location is by the yellow clock tower. We did not have anytime to go to the museum on the land, and did the entire island tour. You take a short ferry ride out to the island on a decent ferry (refreshments are available). On the island you hop into a bus that will take you for a tour. Our tour guide on the bus was a younger local who was fantastic in giving useful information but also making the tour fun. The drive is nice and you stop halfway along the tour at a spot with a great view of Cape Town and table mountain and a place to get some snacks. Then back on the bus to head towards the prison. I would have preferred to have been able to get off the bus at the various stops on the tour for pictures, and experiencing it more, but still a nice tour. Once at the prison you are given a tour by an ex-political prisoner of Robben Island and have a quick tour of the location. It was informative, but a little drier than the bus tour. There are not a lot of exhibits in the prison and you do not get to wander to explore. Afterwards you walk the short distance to the ferry and head back to the mainland. Overall, an excellent experience and glad to have gone. The whole experience is very structured, with almost no free time for one to wander around. I would love to see more exhibits on the island especially in the prison where one could walk around and read and look at things but this is a very new museum. Go early in the morning."

Note if the weather is too rough, the company will cancel the tours but they do provide a refund.The tour itself consisted of a bus ride that was very interesting but in my opinion, could have been a little shorter. The remainder of the tour consisted of visiting the actual prison quarters with an ex-political prisoner as your guide. The tour really only visited a large cell block, courtyard area, and Nelson Mandela's cell. I think it would have been more interesting to visit other parts such as the kitchen area.

The bus tour is not the best way to see the sections of the island. You are not allowed off the bus and have to jockey to see the historic sites with 80 other people. You get one stop to walk around which gives you a nice view of Cape Town and the Island's curio shop. The prison tour was much better. Our guide had been a prisoner during the 70's. He was sentenced as a 19 year old for organizing a high school protest against the government. He was there for 8 years. He answered any questions asked about his life as well as life at the prison. Everyone visiting Cape Town should visit this site just as a reminder to stand up against injustice in the world not just in South Africa."

The guid on the bus was fine: informative and amusing and was followed by an ex political prisoner who again was fine but din't offer much of his own experiences (perhaps he didn't want to relive them.

The ferry trip over was fine - but then you are herded onto a cramped smelly bus with about 80 other people and have to endure a boring trip where you can't see anything if you are on the wrong side of the bus. We saw the quarry - but only with 4 people between us and the window. Then were made to get off the bus after 10 minutes at some random toilet stop. The whole purpose of that seemed to be either to take photos of Cape Town or buy a drink from the bored looking staff at the \"bar\" ( a counter in the corner of a room) Then herded back on a bus to another area where we got off to look at some houses and dog kennels. There were some interesting displays in the houses, but we werent given time to look at them all. Then the \"Meeting\" with a political prisoner. This proved to be thoroughly disappointing and not as informative as we had hoped. Again, we were not given any time to explore on our own, read signs or take in any of the information on notice boards etc. The people who run Robben Island, need to do some work on improving the visitor experience here. Alcatraz would be a good place to start - get some multi lingual self guided tours, give visitors the option to explore on their own, and don't force people to return at set times ( weather permitting obviously). There are many similar facilities in other cities around the world providing a much more informative experience. Would not recommend at all."

Robben Island is about a 30 minute ferry ride from Cape Town. There are several ferry journeys throughout the day that leave from the V & A Waterfront. We were scheduled to catch the 9-00am ferry which ended up leaving at about 9-15am - no reason given for the late departure although it could have been due to some mechanical failure with the main larger ferry as we were all hoarded onto a smaller boat that resulted in a number of people standing. Seas were a little rough and mention was made that trips would be cancelled the following day if the seas became rougher. This did happen as a couple staying at our hotel found out when they arrived at the V & A Waterfront departure point to find their ferry had been cancelled due to rough seas. Would recommend all to phone ahead on the day of their trip to make sure ferries are operating before going to the ferry wharf.Once we docked on the island we were shepherded onto a number of quite old buses that were waiting about 200 metres away for what turned out to be approximately a 45 minute bus tour, with one short hop-off spot to stretch the legs, get a drink etc. At this stop you got a great view of Cape Town and Table Mountain - which must have been a very disheartening sight for the prison inmates - freedom so close yet so very unattainable. A guide aboard the bus gave us all a very informative talk about the history of the island and a brief description of some of the facilities that we saw from the bus including the lime quarry, rock quarry, church, leper's section and graveyard, medium security prison and former guard's quarters. Much of the latter was in a very dilapidated state and appeared to be in danger of being overrun by the seagull and bird colonies. Our last bus stop was at the maximum security prison where political prisoners were held. We were advised that at one stage the political prisoners were housed in together with criminals (murderers etc) but at some point the criminals were moved to the medium security prison.At the maximum security prison we were met by a former inmate who had spent 5 years in the maximum security prison from 1977 to 1982. He had been a high school student when he was arrested for being involved in a rally against apartheid. He showed us through some of the main prison block dormitories with showers/toilets attached. He advised that up to 30 prisoners lived in his dormitory and that for the first year of his term they all slept on blankets/mats on the concrete floor. After that they were given beds. We were then shown through a block were there were about 20 single cells including the one in which Nelson Mandela occupied for most of his time on Robben Island. They were all tiny with no beds (blankets/mat on a concrete floor), no toilets - only a bucket. The prisoners in this section were often required to carry back rocks from the quarry which they then broke into smaller pieces whilst sitting in a small, uncovered, concrete enclosed courtyard outside their cell block.After being shown through this section we then walked about 400/500 metres from the maximum security prison back to the docks for the ferry trip back.Interesting and informative but I thought quite a low-key tour."

You'll get a bus tour of the island and a walking tour of the prison by a former prisoner. The whole thing from leaving the Waterfront to getting back takes about 3.5 hours.For me, the most affecting part of the trip was block A- in here, each of the cells have a picture of a prisoner who stayed there, with a snippet about their time in the prison in their own words.So book early and be prepared for the crowds and the seas, but don't miss it."

Thanks to the guide (not sure what his name is- young and was wearing a green cap) this part of the visit was thoroughly enjoyable and was very informative however there wasn't much time to take pictures etc. The view of table mountain and Cape Town when we stopped for 10 minutes was the highlight of the trip and we were very lucky as the sky was clear. We were then shepherded through the prison in a group of about 100 people with one tour guide, with very little information to give (or I couldn't hear him) and quickly rushed past the iconic cell of Nelson Mandela. I was very keen on getting the nitty gritty information of prison life and I feel that if I hadn't had any background knowledge on apartheid era, I would of gained nothing from the trip. altogether, the trip was extremely disappointing and I ended up buying a book on Robben Island to find out what it actually was all about as the tour did not provide me with the information I was expecting for the money."

The boat normally used was broken so we were put another which took over an hour to get to the island. On our arrival we were hurried on to the buses and given the tour with very little opportunity to take photographs. We were then taken to the prison to meet the ex inmate. Our guide was very passionate but a little difficult to fully understand. A the end of this we felt abandoned without any direction back to the boat or the times we could leave so we just got on the first boat we came to.

I have limited time in Cape Town, the reason I went there is that I am interested in history and want to know about Nelson Mandela of course. To be honest with you, there is not that great views from the island, you can shoot the table mountain and the ocean but you don't necessarily have to come to Robben Island. Not that many people are living there anymore, pretty much the only thing you can see is the prison! After you get off the ferry, you will get on the bus and there will be a guide telling you the history of the island, then you will be taken to the prison where Nelson Mandela stayed, then there will be another guide explain the prison history to you and you can also visit Nelson Mandela's cell, which is the highlight of this trip. The island itself is pretty much deserted if not because of the museum there, a lot of people moved out already so the nothing too much infrastructure there. Also it's hardly to see seals or penguins there, according to the guide the seals have been eaten by the European when they first arrived. In case you don't know, Robben means seal in Dutch, so it actually means Seal island, but there is no seal anymore. Tip 1: try go there in a good weather, otherwise the waves will make you very comfortable and it will influence your visit. Tip 2: try to buy the ticket online, it's efficient and easy for you to plan your schedule. Tip 3: go there early so that you will have better chance to have the top seat to have better view in the ferry."

It was heart rending to view the 6 X 8 cell where Nelson Mandela spent 18 years working during the day in the prison quarry. The sun and the dust at the quarry left him with eye and lung problems. The problem with the tour was the guides. You just couldn't understand them. The guide on the bus, a woman, spoke with an accent, and spoke very softly and rapidly. You could pick up about every third word. The guide on the walking part of the tour had a very gravely voice like Louis Armstrong, spoke in a conversational volume and only the people right up next to him had any chance of understanding him. There were at least 30 people in the group and to those further back, the words were lost. We asked him to speak up, but he never raised his voice to reach further back. He had spent 5 years at Robben Island during Apartheid, so he had a lot of valuable knowledge to impart. It is too bad the people on the tour could not understand what he was saying. The Tour operator needs to give their guides a lot more speaking training, or use professional guides. Other than seeing Mandela's cell and the quarry where he worked, the trip was very disappointing. The history the guides tried to tell us would have been fascinating had we been able to understand it.One possibility would be to hire your own guide for your group. It could be worth the money.Bring a warm jacket as the wind off the water is cold, particularly in the winter."

I would best describe it as a kind of pilgrimage for the average person. Yes, you are essentially going on a prison tour, but being on the island where Nelson Mandela spent almost 30 years of his life should hold some kind of significant meaning to you, if only because you are the kind of decent human being who believes in equality and justice regardless of gender, race or creed.Ferries leaving from the Nelson Mandela Gateway at the V&A Waterfront take guests directly from Cape Town to Robben Island. I believe there are only 3 or 4 departures a day so make sure to check ahead of time to avoid unnecessary waiting or, worse, missing out on the last ferry of the day. Each ferry trip is about 30 minutes and the whole tour is over 2 hours long, so expect to spend a good portion of your day on the tour.Personally, the highlights of the tour were seeing Nelson Mandela's cell and hearing the first-person tales from our tour guide. I believe all the guides who take you around the actual jail cells and prison grounds are former prisoners. At the beginning of the tour we did have a bus ride that took us around the island itself, but this guide wasn't a former prisoner.There are a couple of things I would suggest you keep in mind if you are considering the Robben Island tour.1. If you have small children, I would say any child that is 8 or younger, really think about whether or not you want to take them on the tour with you. It can be a grueling 4 hours for a child to follow his / her parents around an island where there is very little visual stimulus. Let's face it, looking at prison cells and prison grounds can't be all that exciting for children and I'm not so sure that they can truly appreciate the struggles of a political prisoner.2. I have never been sunburned in my life, except the one day I spent at Robben Island. There is not all that much shelter and the sun during the summer months is very unforgiving. So wear lots of sunscreen and cover up any exposed skin if you are visiting during the South African summer.Cape Town is a great city to visit, but make sure to spend some time on Robben Island. The tour is well organized and well worth the price of admission."

The first part of the tour is a bus ride to see most of the island. Our guide was well- versed, and gave us a good talks we drove. We stopped for a couple of minutes at a coffee stand, but the view to Cape Town was so awesome we did not have time to get anything. Then, on to the prison. Our guide was a former prisoner who served five years before the general release occurred. We saw the cell Mandela lived in, and saw the areas where the prisoners bathed and the Common areas. Our guide talked about his ANC training, including East Germany and Russia. It was amazing to see former jailers work in the museum with the former prisoners. It gave Me great hope for South Africa. I recommend this tour to anyone."

You are carried to the island by ferry and then put in a bus with more than fifty others. The drive around the island was supposed to be 45 minutes but lasted almost one and a half hour. The take you to the lime quarry, the isolation cell of Robert Sobukwe and the island's village. This is okay but the guide was, I am sorry to say that, horrible. Everything she explained I could have read in five minutes on wikipedia. At the quarry we stopped but were not allowed to get off the bus, at Sobukwe's cell we were given 15 minutes which is far to less time to read the displays, especially when you are more than fifity people. The worst thing was that her announcements were more like sermons. I reckon everyone who visits Robben Island already knows of the importance of the place but she reminded us every two minutes. The low point was reched when she asked every visitor which country she or he is from then thanking for this country's contributuion to abolish apartheid. Eventually we were dropped off at the high security prison where a new guide took over. The tour got slighlty better now. The guide was a former prisoner and took as through the group celles and eventually to Nelson Mandela's cell. This part of the visit was okay but again there is so much room for improvement. Why for instance, don't they let people walk freely arounf the island and the former prison. Then former inmates could be at certain points and explain to you prison life etc. The visit is very much focussed on Nelson Mandela's cell but there is so much more to Robben Island and I suppose so muc hmore to tell by the former prisoners. The are rewally giving away a good opportunity.To sum it up, as much as the visit is important to every visitor to South Africa and South Africans as well I was very dissapointed with the way they carry out the visit. This could have been a much better and memorable visit."

The boat journey across might be long but we saw three Orca (Killer Whales) jumping through the waves and a pod of dolphins playing in the sea. When you get to the island you are by a bus to take you around, the side of the bus says it all \" The Journey's never long when freedom's the destination\" you get to see the old buildings that prison officers and familes lived. You get to see the limestone quarry that Nelson Mandela prisoner 46664 worked in. Then you get to the prison it's self, your tour guide is a former prisoner who was in Prison with Mandela. They tell there stories and memories. To see what they lived in is heartbreaking. A visit to Robben Island makes me thankful for freedom of speech and thought we are allowed to have in 2013.

I cannot tell you how disappointed I was; not with finally seeing the cell that Nelson Mandela served a 17 year prison sentence or meeting one of the actual prisoners of the island who was hired as a guide; but with the way that the government employees at the island and the museum have taken advantage of the Mandela name to turn a sacred site into a tourist trap.Upon arrival to the island we were herded into hot, over-crowded buses (from which you could hardly see out of) and driven around with a guide whose English was poor and accent was so heavy that she could not be understood. We were then taken to a kiosk on the island to take pictures and were left there for an inordinate amount of time - not what we had paid to see or do in our limited time as ictated by the government tour organizers. We finally were taken to the maximum security prison where we were allowed to get off the bus and see and hear about the prison itself.It was a great disappointment to me that this lifetime experience was ruined by lazy, self-entitled government employees. They and the government of So Africa should be ashamed of themselves.Shelly"

The tour is NOT scary. Some people warned me that my children might be afraid. That is not true. I actually think going to Alcatraz is more scary.

As a visitor to SA i got the sense that South Africans I was with on the trip were indeed visiting as part of the healing process - to a place that was once despised by the black community and those who had the sense to call for the end of apartheid regardless of their creed. The prison is much as it was and only covering a tiny amount of the island. We were greeted by an old political prisoner who spoke well and told of the time spent here and the harshness of the prison regime.I left however feeling as though something was missing. Hard to put my finger on it - but I think probably the place could do with a little development. Perhaps add a museum. If the intention is to leave the island alone and present a bleak and uninteresting place then the authorities have largely succeeded."

Robben Island is one of those places that makes you really feel the history that occurred there, from the leper colony to the political prison that held Nelson Mandela. It is something that just simply needs to be experienced.We got lucky and reserved two tickets on a ferry for the next day, but this isn't recommended - seats on the ferry can fill up a week or two in advance. The line to get on the ferry is very long as well, so leave plenty of time before your ferry is scheduled to depart for waiting and security. We don't normally get motion sickness, but the ferry is pretty small and it was really windy, so we were glad that we had though to take motion sickness medication that morning, because it would have been a rough ride without it. Passengers are guided to comfortable buses after arrival on Robben Island and the tour begins. You are driven around the island and its history is explained; endangered bird habitat here, former leper colony there, view of Cape Town and Table Mountain, deserted village, among other very interesting things. And then you get to the political prison and you get out for a second tour. Former political prisoners actually give the tours through the prison, so it is an incredibly powerful experience. It is difficult to wrap your head around what prisoners actually went through while being held there. You will wait in line to look through the window to Mandela's cell, which is tragically sparse and cramped. You then usually have time to walk around the island a bit, but you don't want to miss the last ferry, so keep track of time. We walked over to the coast to see the penguin colony, and although you could only see them from a distance, it was worth checking out. Boulders Beach is a much better viewing spot for penguins, honestly, but the coast along Robben Island is quiet and beautiful, and the penguins just add to it. We walked past fields of beautiful wildflowers and colonies of sea birds along the rocky sea wall on our way back to the ferry as well."

The tour through the prison by a former political prisoner was great, but I feel like it can be rushed for the guide since he had so much to talk about (a good thing).

Even if I only had 2 days in Cape Town, I would take half a day to take the ferry out to Robben Island. It is the only place in the world, where you can be at one World Heritage Site and see another (Table Mountain). The trip is actually 3 tours in one. The first is the boat ride to and from the island. The ferry is large and comfortable but if you want seats outside at the top, then you will want to be at the front of the line when it comes time to board. The video displays give you information about the island or you can just hang outside and watch the beautiful views of Cape Town. Once you disembark, you will board buses for your second tour. The bus drives you around the island while a guide tells you what your looking at (island school, church, Robert Sobukwe internment site, WWII gun battery). We got out once to grab a cup of coffee and see the view of Cape Town. The tour is in English which is widely spoken in Cape Town a the other parts of South Africa where we visited.The third tour (and highlight) is the tour of the prison led by an ex-political prisoner. Our guide informed us through the use of personal stories and anecdotes. Since these men are in their 60's or older, you will not get this opportunity for very much longer. You will see Mandela's cell. You can't go inside his cell but can go inside others.Finally, you take the long (actually quite short) walk to freedom from the prison back to the dock where you can buy souvenirs from the gift shop. I highly recommend a visit to this one of a kind world heritage site. BTW, the weather in the winter often does not allow the ferry to make the trip to the island so you might want to book this tour first. We couldn't go the first time we wanted because of the weather and we couldn't go on another day because the island was closed because of President Obama's visit. We went the day after he visited and they still had the US flag in one of the conference rooms."

There was another ferry at the dock but it too was not working due to mechanical issues. The boats we then took were slow and the return caused us connection issues because of the extended time getting to and from.

We visited Robben Island as a combined family, with 6 adults, 2 children, and a 2 month old baby.The trip itself was very informative, and interesting, and the 2 guides we had were both friendly and willing to share their stories. The boat trip to the island was OK, although I think the engines need servicing, as there was a terrible smell from a cloud of black smoke which blew into the cabin form the back deck.The groups were also a little big in my view, especially when touring the Maximum Security Prison, they could have done with splitting the group in 2 so it isn't so crowded.Families must note the following:Everyone has to have a \"ticket\" to travel to the island. There is an adult price and then kids are charged at 120ZAR I think (almost 15USD) - now I understand the importance of everyone having a ticket, in case of emergencies, people can be accounted for. But to charge 15$ for a 2 month old baby who slept the whole trip, can't speak, and who wouldn't have been listening to the tour, I think is ridiculous.We booked on line to save queuing (no discount for booking online - unlike table mountain), and didn't pre-book a ticket for my 2 month old daughter, as I didn't think for one minute she would need one. The staff didn't seem bothered when I had to go and buy another ticket & complained. Unfortunately, although informative, it is a bit of a \"tour factory\". You are just \"one of the masses\" So that was a real shame and put a dampener on the whole day for us."

If you are seasick, then I suggest you inquire on which of the boats are the slowest because the one we rode on, was so fast that even me, not prone to seasickness, was almost at the point of needing a bag. When we got there we waited around for a bit since there was some confusion as to who our tour guide would be. Eventually we were let inside and a former prisoner announced himself as our guide and walked us through the prison. It was quite informative and we even got to see the actual cell that Mandela was in. You can tell that they did a lot to make the place look better, but you can imagine how worse it was back in those days. At the end of the tour we were loaded on the buses for a tour of the island. We were able to see the quarry that the prisoners worked in and also the huge guns that were used to protect the island if under seige. We also got to stop at some point to take the most gorgeous photos of Table Mountain and also to get snacks before continuing on. All in all we enjoyed the tour and would advise others who have never been to visit. I will say that once you have been, there really isn't a reason to visit again.I will advise that you purchase your tickets in advance, especially in peak season. Also, make sure that you get there at least half hour before the departure time, THEY WILL LEAVE YOU!"

There are few who have not heard of the apartheid and how Robben Island became the detention centre for all the male dissidents during the political struggles in South Africa at the time. And while its infamous political prisoner Nelson Mandela of 18 years is likely the main 'attraction' for why many people visit the island, the history of its past, and what is now symbolizes for humanity and human rights globally is a must do while visiting Cape Town. Booking your ticket early is a must as I had to wait four days before to could get a spot. But, the price is very reasonable and I am glad I was able to wait and still go. The island and prison tour was very informative and the short bus tour to some of the islands' hi-lites while modest in comfort are also noteworthy. Although the prison tour itself was informative, it is/was the fact that the tour was conducted by one of the former political prisoners who shared some of his life story that made the tour more impactful and memorable. While the legacy of Robben Island will live on because it has been declared a national monument and heritage site by UNESCO, I recommend visiting while the tour is still able to include some of the living legends who were imprisoned and who are still able to share some of their story. And although the islands' significance may never be forgotten, like the Nazi concentration camps I have visited, the attraction may become sterile and its message fade."

I'm going to qualify this review by first of all saying, that if like me you grew up in the 1970s and 80s during the apartheid era and took a keen interest in the ending of that regime, visiting Robben Island is a must. I booked my trip online a few weeks beforehand and so had a ticket already booked. I had not given any thought to the fact that the trip might be cancelled due to rough seas, so I was lucky because boat trips had not been running on previous days. The day I went the sea was beautifully calm and the view of Cape Town as we were leaving the water front and on the way back were spectacular and a great pho to opportunity.The trip to Robben Island itself was perfect. On arrival, we were put into coaches and allocated a tour guide. Ours was a young man with great personality and a great deal of enthusiasm in telling the story of the island. This portion of the trip took about 45 mins and the visit to the lime quarry where men were forced to work was particularly moving.The second portion of the trip was to the prison itself where we were shown around by a former political prisoner from the 1980s. There was plenty of time to ask him questions as a group and what we learnt in that hour-long visit to the prison will stay with me forever. We all managed to walk past and take a look into Mr Mandela's cell but there were a lot of us in our group so you couldn't stand and look in really for more than a few seconds.I would have no hesitation in recommending this trip, it was an extremely moving experience and even the teenage children who were in my group seemed genuinely engaged with the stories the prisoner told."

We learned more about Robben Island from the recent film \u201cGoodbye Bafana\u201d, about the relationship between Mandela and one of his jailers. If you want to go, either book online or turn up early at the ticket office and be prepared to spend the morning looking round the very interesting Waterfront while you wait for your ferry slot. The sea is rougher in the afternoons, and the ferry takes 30 mins. If it is really rough, the ferry is cancelled. The guides on the island are former inmates of the prison, but their skill as guides varies. Ours liked the sound of his own voice far too much and just wasted time. We were in a far-too-large group of one hundred people, shuffling slowly about, listening to the guide drivelling on. He had some interesting things to say but they were lost in the pointless rambling. We eventually abandoned him after an hour of boredom, and looked around ourselves. But a good guide would have added so much more.They evidently did not have enough guides (or were too badly organised) to run smaller groups.  Sincethere are not enough guides to cope with the numbers, and former inmates will get older and die out, someone needs to save and use their memories. Film and record interviews with the former inmates and edit these precious nuggets of first-hand experience and oral history to use in the different rooms, and make a film for while people are queueing for the ferry. Smaller groups could be run by extra guides - and all guides should be trained, as their skill varies. There are many people who need the work and could do a good job with training. The tourist facilities on the island were very poor - a small fly-blown shop and tatty toilet such as you might expect to find at a tiny garage in the middle of nowhere. And there was quite a bit of waiting about for the next ferry. Compare this to the excellent operation of Table Mountain, run by a private company. The Robben Island operation had government bureacratic inefficiency stamped all over it like the Moscow Co-op. It is an important cultural resource and could be so much more professional \u2013 and generate more money too."

This was OK, but leave visitors with no time for reflection. You make two stops, one of which seems mainly to be to allow you to buy souvenirs at the Southern point of the island (but did at least allow me to wander slightly away from the group).The tour round the prison that follows suffered from an ex-political prisoner who seemed to be remote from the the whole thing; I guess it's not easy having to relive hard times three or four times a day for tourist groups, but he seemed unnaturally detached and we spent a long time ion the first blockhouse (so that other parties could go past Mandela's cell first). This meant that at the end we had to rush back from the prison to the harbour with no time to ourselves. Of course, ironically this might reflect one of the realities of prison life, but I boarded the boat feeling I had visited the island, but not really been there."

The 35 minute boat trip can be a little bumpy, but we fell very save, on the top deck, with the beautiful views on a clear day. When you arrive at the island, there will be busses. Get on one of those and you'll be shown around on the island. There are several stops, where you get some explanation about what you see. Our guide was very informative, repeating some things and very easy to understand and hear. You get off the bus 3 times (which feels like a school trip, 'You have to be back in 10 minutes'). One of the stops is at a small shop where you can buy snacks and drinks and use the restrooms. The last stop is at the orison itself, where your guide will be an ex-prisoner. Ours was a member of the ANC. He had a very impressive story to tell about apartheid, his time in prison and how great it was to live in a country where he had the freedom of choice. He showed us Mandela his prison cell, which most people seem to come for. We then walked back to the boats and the boat left Robben Island a few minutes later. We were back around 3.We enjoyed our trip a lot, especially because of the fantastic guides we had. It might be a different experience when you don't have the guides that we had. Besided that, it was just a really nice day out with lovely weather and great views. The critism that most people on TA have, is the lack of information provided by the organisation. They are right about that, because no one will tell you about the boats, there is no schedule and no information provided on paper. There's no real restaurant, but you don't visit Robben Island for food, right? The tour is also not about Nelson Mandela only, it's about the island where he has been for many years.

Beware that you do need to buy your tickets in advance if you're not going through a company, and you might have to wait a bit to board the boat. Our guides (both on the bus and then in the prison) were absolutely fantastic. The views of Cape Town from the island are also spectacular. I read Mandela's \"Long Walk to Freedom\" before going, which I'm very glad I did as it gave me a better understanding once I was there. Should be at the top of any visitor's list in Cape Town."

It really only housed political leaders and albeit that it housed Nelson Mandela, not much was said about him. We were quickly rushed through the tour as some stragglers had to use the restrooms. Long queue meant the rest of us waiting and the bus. I wished we were able to walk around some of the sites that were shown. And the best part was the view of table mountain. So word of advice. Use restroom before boarding and bring snacks as there isn't anywhere to buy on the island except chips, coffee and water. And on the way back try to catch the princess... The pirate ship is too slow. I guess it's an experience but I learned more from other museums"

I'd like to start off by saying that I would've rated our experience on Robben Island as \"very good\" had it not been for the way things turned out. The tour was interesting and informative, and an important part of South African history that is very imporant to be preserved.We took the 3pm tour to Robben Island from Nelson Mandela Gateway. We were told that the ferry would return to collect us at 6pm after our tour was finished. By 5:50pm we were waiting on the pier with around 80 other passengers but no boat arrived. Eventually a boat arrived at around 6:30 however it was not the same boat which brought us across and therefore did not have capacity to take all the tourists remaining. The Robben Island tour staff were not helpful at all, could not offer any specific information as to whether or not another boat was coming and left their clients waiting in the freezing cold and dark. Eventually at 7:15pm a novelty pirate ship arrived (the Jolly Roger) and they transported us back to Cape Town. We only arrived on the mainland at 8:40pm. The crew were not expecting any tourists (they told us the only reason they had come was to drop off 2 Robben Island staff members) which means the Robben Island tourism department had no idea what was happening and took no responsibility for the safety of their customers. It took over an hour to get back to the mainland due to the fact that they boat was not built to travel at speed in those weather conditions, which is not the fault of the Jolly Roger or their crew, but rather of Robben Island management who did not make sufficient arrangements for their clients. I understand that your main ferry was in for a service, but surely an organisation which transports so many tourists every day should have more than one boat? And if they are going to rely on private charters, surely they should be reliable?It was a horrible experience, completely overshadowing the experience of visiting such an historical landmark of our country. This organisation represents not only Cape Town tourism but the whole of South Africa and it is an absolute shame that it is managed so poorly."

The tour is very good and very informative but you do sit on a bus for 40 min so take a bottle of water if it is warm.My one and only complaint is there is not enough time to have a wander around as it is literally boat, bus tour, inmate tour, boat, another hour would be perfect. The issue being you cannot take additional time as you are booked on a return ferry that is just 3 hours from departure. I would recommend this tour"

Numbers of visitors will vary according to the time of year, and when we went, February, they were not too large. The guides were interesting and knowledgeable but it would be nice to be able to spend the length of time of your choice at each stop off ( so should be hop on/hop off not scheduled times).There are information boards which are also helpful but at busy times you may find it difficult to get to them straight away."

Before I start, I am not reviewing the significance of this site; there is no doubting that if you visit Cape Town you really must see the prison where the freedom fighters and now leaders of South Africa were imprisoned for a huge proportion of their lives. What I am reviewing is how this important site is displayed and explained to tourists. There is no choice here - you must do the one and only tour on offer. The tour groups are simply too big, there is scant information to read or look at other than the tour-guides' commentary, and you have zero free time on the island expect at a cafe where you are stuck for 20 minutes. You are herded like cattle onto a large ferry with 100s of other tourists. If you get sick-sea like me, definitely take heavily duty medication beforehand because this is a rolling ride and unless you arrive about 1 hour early for the tour, you will be on the underneath level without thought to people like us. You are shown a short video on the way over which is one of the most informative parts of the tour - a more updated TV monitor would have been appreciated. You are then herded into groups and onto a series of large buses. You wait and wait for your buses' turn to leave then are shown three sites from the bus - there is no chance to get out to look around except at a cafe where you are given too much time!!! Having an ex-inmate as the tour-guide for the actual prison is a good idea but they clearly gave him a standard talk and allowed the guy one sentence to speak of his own experiences. What a waste! Also, with the large size of the groups shown around, you can easily miss large chunks of what he says, you struggle to see the two or three faded photos that are provided, and you have to cue to take pictures of the key sites.Ways to improve this tour:- Do away with the structured tours altogether and instead allow people to visit the island at their own pace. Run the ferry constantly back and forth, and offer a hop-on-hop-off bus around the island that runs regularly.- Offer tours of the prison in small groups.- Offer tours by both ex-inmates (whose English was mostly understandable for me, but I noticed would challenging for many others to understand) and guides for whom English is their first language.- Add many, many information boards, photos and other exhibitions to explain the key sites - there were a total of two very faded picture boards with no written captions even. If for preservation reasons these cannot be added to the island, provide written material, a map and even audio commentary of the sites.- If possible expand the number of sites available - there is currently not that much to see."

It is a shame that the tour to Robben Island is not as good as it could be, because Robben Island is an important part of the history of South Africa. If you are in Cape Town, you should go, but go with low expectations. I suspect part of the limited nature of the tour is the fact that the island is heritage listed - you are not free to wander around and explore, but confined to a bus/coach for most of the tour, and there is no infrastructure for tourists except a kiosk the bus travels to. The guides on the coach do their best, but there is only so much information that can be conveyed using the PA system and asking people to look out the left or right side windows. The second part of the tour is a guided tour around the Robben Island prison itself. This is much better, and often conducted by a former political prisoner, but there are no plaques and no information boards (a few faded photos are on boards, but nothing with history or explanations - unlike the waiting room for the ferry ride to the island itself, which you don't spend time in unless you are at the head of the very long queue)."

I highly suggest getting tickets ahead of time. Some of the tour times sell out quickly. Some of the displays and rooms were closed in the Gateway Building. The informaton placards are a bit worn and you move so quickly to board the boat that you miss a lot and there is no way to see this when you return. Once arriving on the island you board a bus for a very structured tour. Our guide (a young woman who was smart, funny and interactive) gave us a good history and overview of the island-which on its own has a history for the poor and leprosy colonies that were housed there. You are captive on the bus until you get a short walk thru the actual prison where Mr. Mandela was held. At this point your narrative/tour is taken over by an ex-prisoner who gives you first hand anecdotes about the horrors of this place. It is a must see/experience because (from our US perspective) apertheid still exists in SA. Robben Island and political prisons is a relevant topic no matter what your background or experience. One plus for the length of the tour is that you get a great view of Cape Town from the water."

Firstly the staff behind the booths for tickets and the collection of tickets are not very friendly or understanding; I had a huge problem as my tickets were not there and not booked as I had booked them. I was told they not there and the tour I have booked is full although Robben Island had my booking and I had a piece of paper with my booking on and all my details etc. I was told they would try rectify the matter asap.While I was waiting, I overheard many tourists asking for tickets for the next available tour. The staff were not too friendly to many of the foreigners and did not explain as to how it all works, they should in fact explain to people that they could book online way in advance to prevent disappointment. They would just say no sold out.The site for anyone reading this is to book tickets way in advance is http://www.webtickets.co.za, on this site you can choose dates, times as well as what ferry you wish to take or another option is www.computicket.com.I suggest that you book well in advance as they fill up very fast to avoid been disappointed, also try see what the weather is doing for the day you want to go, we had some rain but they still went ahead with the ferry. Now back to the tourists, I felt bad as many were turned away without an explanation as to why and how they could prevent this happening again or giving options as where to go from there. Eventually a lady came and stated that I must wait for all passengers to board and they will see if there are any tickets left for that tour I was supposed to be on that i had booked for. I booked this 10 days in advance via the management of Robben Island. We waited and waited and we were shoved aside with the staff members.None the less the lady eventually gave us tickets and we boarded the ferry named Sikhululekile, as we were pretty much last to board so we had no choice of seats and had to sit separate on the lower deck. I went up a level and saw two available seats opposite each other. I called mum and we went up there. At least here we had a decent view and we could walk outside and take some photos. The view from the second deck was stunning and you did not have to contend with the wind like the higher deck above, but I went above anyway to see the surroundings. They play a video for your viewing on the history and a few other things but I opted to focus on the scenery and get some fresh air instead.After a bumpy 30-40 minute ferry trip, we docked by Robben Island, we got off and no one really tells you what to do or where to go, we followed everyone in lead and saw 4 buses a little way up, people were standing around and staff did not seem interested when I eventually asked what to do and we were told to get on the buses and to wait. The buses are very out dated and pretty old but it's a way of transport around the island.We had a friendly tour guide Ryas, he tried his best to make us feel welcome and make a few jokes along the way, since reading previous reviews, and I guess these jokes are the same but at least he is trying to lighten up the mood of all. We did the bus trip which was ok as Ryas talks fast about history and wildlife etc of the island, we had a 5-10 minutes break at the one shop that supposedly is managed by Christo Brand who was a prison guard who was one of several that were responsible for guarding Nelson Mandela.We then got back on the bus and the tour carried on, I noticed that the island is not very well kept, its worn and looking very old and run down. We eventually then were told we were heading now to the prison part of the tour and we would like the prisoners would do \"the walk to freedom\" as many as them had done when their time was up at Robben Island. We walked towards the prison and a Black gentleman was standing there who I later asked his name and was told by him it was Kgotso. We were shown into the prison and everyone was hustling looking for Mandela's Cell, Kgotso was nowhere to be seen. I eventually found him and asked where Mandela's cell was he smiled and said we will go to it shortly.We were taken into a courtyard and he spoke to us a bit and introduced himself to us. He then showed us Mandela's cell and everyone took their pictures and we were told to meet back in the courtyard. On the way back I grabbed Kgotso and chatted as we walked and I asked how long he had been a prisoner for here, he told me 6years. I asked him if he did not mind to tell me why, he replied he would later in the tour.We then went to Kgotso cell which was much larger and had 30 prisoners in it at one time. He told us his story and that he should have stayed in prison for 25 years but was released in 1991 when all prisoners were released and was asked to return as a tour guide.After Kgotso had told us his story he asked if there was any questions, there was one about Malema, and Kgotso stated Malema is dead, not physically but dead, I guess he meant politically. We then left and Kgotso was waiting outside and shook everyone's hand as we walked past, again my mum and I just followed people as where to head to next.We took some pictures outside the Maximum security prison and strolled back casually as we thought we had some time. We did not even get to go see the penguins as Ryas suggested we go do. We were in the shop and we were rushed and told we have 2 minutes remaining and told to hurry up the ferry is leaving soon, we opted to go to the toilet facilities before the ferry trip back, what a disaster, the toilets were in a disgusting state and looked as if they had not been cleaned for awhile so we decided to rather go at The V & A Victoria Wharf Market where we were going to have a very late lunch for the day as you do not have time to really eat and drink anything or to look around and do your own thing on the island, it's very rushed and I did not enjoy it.Maybe that's because I have been to Alcatraz in San Francisco and its very different tour from Robben Island - you use personal headphones in your own home language and you do the tour in your own time and listen to an inmate while telling you where to go and do, you also can leave on any ferry you wish. Here it felt more like a school tour and we had to listen to the teacher. It felt more like the staff had a task to do and it was a job and they did it to get through the day and their paycheck"

The whole purpose of the tour and visit is about showing the world what ALL the people of South Africa were subjected to during the apartheid era, and showing without holding back any detail, the savagery of what man did to man.The Boat trip, if you travel on the older boats, you are travelling on the very boats used to transport Prisoners, though, you will have the benefit of seating and open air, you will not be shackled along with your fellow prisoners in the bowels of the Boat. The Sea can be rough and if you get seasick be under no illusion about the journey.... but at least try to imagine what it was like doing that trip shackled in the hold! Me I love the sea and thoroughly enjoyed the journey in both directions especially the sea life and the views of Cape Town and Table Mountain, things the prisoners would not have been able to even see.The bus tour of the Island I found very interesting and I tried to imagine how the prisoners must have felt, the hopelessness of their situation, no possibility of escape and surviving. The Quarry area where prisoners spent their days breaking rocks and the conditions they endured. It is easy to understand how many ex-prisoners now suffer serious Eyesight Problems and Chest/Lung Problems to this day. The dust and the blinding sun reflecting from the white rocks....easy but scary to imagine.The tour of the Prison Buildings and Cell areas, again very interesting and, very daunting. Never forget that this trip is about showing what people endured for years, in some cases lifetimes, to try to get a better life for their fellow man.It is good to note that many of the visitors to the Island are Parties of School Children. To allow these children to see and understand what their Fathers endured.... Yes it is so recent that it could be their Fathers and Grandfathers. It is a wise and courageous decision to show these children first hand what Apartheid was like.I urge you to visit if you can........... Theme Park? it is Not! Political? almost certainly, that's what Apartheid was! Uncomfortable? At times yes.... you are there for a short time, Nelson Mandela was there for 18 of his 27 years in Prison, many of the years on Robben Island spent in isolation!Visit this piece of living history, remember what went on here and the inhumanity of man to man.And if you have Children with you.... Take them.... We might just get a better world!Review resubmitted by contributor after editing a significant typo."

I am not going to say this is the most riveting brilliant tour I went to while in South Africa.But to have visited the place where Nelson Mandela , an icon recognised all over the world, was enough for me.To hear about the brutality of the place, from an ex prisoner called Sipho Msomi , but also the imagination and ingenuity of the prisoners, who lets remember shaped the modern South Africa, and managed to survive what was thrown at them..Sipho, himself was a character, and it was hard to realise had actually spent time in this place himself. To be in Cape Town and not visit here would be criminal."

Seeing Mandela's cell, the lime pit where he worked and the yard he exercised in for all those years in confinement was inspiring. How could this man have overcome bitterness and not sought vengeance against those who imprisoned him? Amazing!!Could parts be better? Probably yes- especially the bus ride at the beginning of the tour. But the time spent with a former Robben Island inmate who led our group and descrbied what it was like to be imprisoned there was one of the best things we did while in South Africa.Very Highly Recommended."

When we arrived at The Nelson Mandela Gateway we waited to board the ferry - there was a modern looking one and an old one, and it was the old one we were taken too. I only mention this as my wife can get sick on rough seas and that's exactly what happened! Not a great start to the tour for my wife, considering we were on our honeymoon! I don't know a huge amount about boats or ferries but maybe the modern one would have given us a smoother ride to Robben Island, as it was quite choppy to say the least!Anyway, once we arrived (it took about 40 minutes) we got onto the bus for a 25 minute tour of the island which was interesting. Then we went to the main attraction, the prison where Nelson Mandela was held for so long. The tour guide was someone who was a prisoner at Robben Island and his insights were very interesting and informative, and definitely added to the experience.If you ever visit Cape Town it is definitely worth visiting!"

The medic was nowhere to be found, we tried the medical centre, the house the medic lives in, the beach. The cell phone was not being answered. The security man was very helpful, he did all he could, however I received no first aid at all, as a qualified first aider my self I knew ice was needed, this was not available. I am very surprised there was not anyone who knew simple first aid. Everyone tried their best but, without basic first aid it was a hopeless situation. I highly commend the very considerate young man who took me by wheelchair onto the boat, and pushed me all the way to the car park. Over 4 hours after the accident we stopped and bought ice. Consequently I am still wearing a splint and using crutches, and needing physiotherapy, which is expensive. Earlier intervention could have made the situation easier for me. My main point is should this have been a heart attack, or a wound that needed stitches, or a fall which the patient was unconscious, what would have happened ? I will have to return to complete my tour, I never did get to see Nelson Mandela's cell! It concerns me with so many tourists in and out of Robben Island every day this is a situation which needs addressing."

The boat trip across to the island is quite spectacular but the time on the island is badly managed. Our principal reason for going was to understand what life was like in the prison but we spent most of the time travelling around the island on a coach! When we finally got to the prison our guide, a former prisoner, explained that the guides were all frustrated that they did not have enough time to explain everything and give a proper guided tour. Our guide was very knowledgeable and very fascinating giving us an idea of life in the prison when he was there. We were rushed around, a quick glimpse at Nelson Mandela's cell, the toilets and washroom and exercise yard and then we were left to walk back to the harbour. We were hurried along by staff who wanted us back on the boat so there was no time to look in the shop. As a museum it fails, as there is very little information or pictures about the past...in any areas with info you are rushed along and have no time to read or digest especially as you are with a large group of people all trying to have a look at the same time. The total time was about 4 hours.I really feel the management are keen to take your money but are not listening to their own staff and the visitors about how the experience could be considerably improved. Do not take the trip if you are not good on boats...the journey can be rough and quite a few people were sick."

No chance to take any photos as on a bus. It was back to the prison where we were put in a long room and spoken to by a former inmate for an hour about his time in prison. Very interesting talk but had switched off by the end. It was out into the courtyard and a brief walk past Mandela's cell and out to the gift shop and boat home.

As a guide in Africa i have taken 100's of pax on this trip and I feel that it is something that everyone SHOULD do to gain a historical, cultural and fundamental understanding of South Africa, but honestly despite saying this, don't expect too much from it. The group sizes are very big, the guides (ex prisoners) generally struggle with language and volume and at times it is very dull. BUT don't let any of this stop you from going, because it will give you the best understanding of the struggles of South Africa that you can possibly get outside of a township!!!!The boat trip out there can be VERY rough so make precautions for it and weather changes quickly. Amazing view of Cape Town at one stop and a good way to spend half a day if you are looking for culture instead of adrenaline.

There is sandwiches and snacks and liquid refreshments on board as well as toilets.In the indoor deck there is a video showing all about Robben Island.As soon as you arrive on the island you are taken to buses and a 45 minute bus tour around the island commences with an excellent and informative tour guide. The bus stops at points of interest so you are able to take pictures.After the bus tour you are shown around the prison by an ex politcal prisoner who gives an informative account of prison life on the island. You are of course shown Nelson Mandella's cell and the courtyard where he used to hide and bury the manuscripts of the book he was writing.It's an amazing insight into what prison life must have been like here.At the end of the tour there is free time to browse in the shop or take the short walk to where the penguins are.

A visit to Nelson Mandela's cell was also an interesting insight to those times during the apartheid era.A word of warning, the catamaran is a fast vessel and if you are prone to sea sickness, always try to sit on the upper deck.

My wife and I had booked onto the 09:00 sunday morning tour. we left from the V&A waterfront and the sea crossing took about 35 minutes and had great views back to Cape Town - and especially the football stadium! We were luck as the seas were quite calm and the boat looked quite acceptable to use with an upper deck for around 30 people or so, and seating for another 90 or so below.As you land at Robben Island you see penguins, seals and lots of birds. Then board buses to start the tour (the seats were quite small and squashed - my wife is quite small and even she said so!). The tour guide was informative, friendly and gave some good background on the struggles. The thing I liked was it was not over-promoted as a Neslon Mandela prison or visit. He was mentioned - and highlighted at the end - but put in context as one of many and of course it was a prison and lepreacy colony inthe 1800's so well before the apartheid struggles and political prisoners from the 1960's onwards.Inside the prison itself an actual inmate (from around 1989) conducted the tour and that was quite humbling. It was not a \"Disney\" polished presentation but that made it all the better - it is a fine line between imparting\\ sharing history and putting ex prisoners \"on show\" and i think they did it very well. The balance was probably right on that front.Overall I think over time they can do so much more though with the tour to make it event better. More information\\ displays on all the activities that have occured on the island. Having mentioned \"Disney\" you could just imagine how much better as an educational experience they would make of it - if probably a bit Over The Top as well but maybe a better balance has to be done.Our visit finished at 12:15 as we departed back to the V&A Waterfront for 1.00pm.We would put this as a top 2 or 3 experience and were so glad that we made the effort to go to Robben Island and now we are back in the UK after our holiday, it has made my wife and I dig out the Nelson Mandela autobiography again to re-read and put our real experience back into a new context.We would recommend you go - but book online in advance!"

The fact that we wee given a tour by a former inmate was all the more special and we found his stories captivating. If you can ignore and get over all the other annoying tourists you will have a very special trip."

Boat was an hour late & very full, on arrival on island loaded onto an old bus that stopped every few minutes while guide explained particular building etc, this was a bit tedious as I felt we could carry on moving during the talk. The best part of the trip was entering the prison but would have been really good if we could have access to all areas including the kitchen & eating area, the ex-prisoner was very interesting & he was happy for anyone to ask him any questions they wanted, after his tour it was back to the boat. So overall worth seeing but some of it was rather tedious with too much stopping & starting on the bus, guide was nice but we did struggle to understand all she was saying, oh & the only shop on site ran out of water for sale! Would I go back? No, but glad I did experience it."

            "review": "Fascinating. The boat to the island leaves from V&A Waterfront daily at 9am, 11am, and 1pm . It is recommended to book well in advance as the tour doesn't operate if the sea is choppy and will be postponed until the weather is better. The boat trip takes 30 minutes and upon arrival all visitors are put onto buses which transport them around the island, stopping at important locations for photo opportunities such as Mandela's cell and the limestone quarry which was responsible for ruining his eyesight.The information given by the tour guides is fascinating and the fact that an ex-prisoner retells his experiences of his time in the prison makes it all the more credible and real. I would recommend reading Mandela's book, \"Long Road to Freedom\" before visiting, as one can then understand the austerity of the island and the harsh conditions encountered by prisoners. I think they may have deliberately left the island the way it was during the apartheid years, rather than develop it into a full-blown tourist attraction such as Alcatraz in the US. Everything one sees on the island falls into place and is more meaningful once the book has been read about the struggle. Although there is a souvenir shop there is little time to explore it as visitors need to be back at the boat at a certain time for the trip back to Cape Town. The trip on the way back can get rough so if you get sea-sick you may need to take a sea-sickness tablet beforehand. The boat hands opened to doors to the cabin but it wasn't enough to stop some people from getting sick. Also it can get windy and chilly both on the boat and on the island, so take a warm sweater."

As i am South African and making my first trip to this island my feeling was that political prisioners from this island overthrew the previous rulers of South Africa and the we went from a apartheid rule to full democracy. It was Mr. Nelson Mandela who was banished for life and was released after 27 years to become the first president in the new democracy .Our tour guide Patrick Matanjana, spent 20 years behind bars on the island ,his insight to the island was very descriptive as his prison cell was NO 1 and Nelsons cell was NO 5.The island was a leper colony thereafter was used for political prisioners .The Moturu Kramat, a sacred site for Muslim pilgrimage on Robben Island, was built in 1969 to commemorate Sayed Abdurahman Moturu, the Prince of Madura. Moturu, one of Cape Town's first imams, who was exiled to the island in the mid-1740s and died there in 1754.I really enjoyed this tour ."

There is a small museum there, but this was closed when we visited. Once on the island, there is a coach tour around the main sights, including the lime quarry, lighthouse and the house where Robert Sobukwe was detained; but you are unable to get out of the bus. In the prison itself there are guided tours conducted by ex-prisoners, which is absolotely fascinating to hear their stories.There is a really good bookshop near the jetty where you get the boat back to Cape Town, where you can buy souvenirs, and also a decent selection of books about the struggle.All in all a moving and worthwhile experience, and a fabulous view of Cape Town across the bay. Highly recommended."

There are stops for photo sessions and all passengers are eventually delivered to the prison where an ex-prisoner will guide you through the actual premises and relate the history of the penal colony during the days of apartheid. The actual time spent in the prison is quite brief as the tours are on tight time schedules to coincide with the boat departures. This is our second visit to the island and there dose seem to be a need to shorten the coach tour in order to provide some more time in the prison in the company of the ex-prisoner. The prison cell occupied by Nelson Mandela is viewed from the adjacent corridor only but other exhibits are fascinating."

The island tour has been severely cut back, our guide new her stuff however her delivery was difficult for English speakers, I felt sorry for the foreigners, her delivery improved when telling us to TIP!The lack of Management was obvious as some staff lazed about near the harbour when maintenance was sadly lacking on paths, stairs and toilet facilities. Vast areas needed weeding as the vegetation appeared to be taking over in much of the facility. The limestone quarry is now restricted to the visitor, on my earlier visits this was a sobering area where you could reflect on the hardship of the inmates, now it scruffy with pine weeds growing on the old road.The high point was going around the prison with Mr Sparks, once again he gave a passionate description of life and hardship mixed with a little humour,what a pity the Management haven't the same commitment and passion!My advice is if you want to see this truly historic site which is so important in the formation of a Democratic South Africa, visit it soon as on my experiance it won't be worth seeing, this is despite considerably higher visitor numbers, I wonder where all the extra revenue is being spent, it certainly isn't on the Facility!"

Once at the island, chaos ensues to get everyone on the buses waiting to take you on tour of the island. During the bus ride, you get commentary from a guide and stop and different locations on the island, including a bathroom and snack break, before you are returned to the prison area for your tour of it with a former political prisoner, where they so you around the prison and give you its history including its occupants, the most famous one being Mandela, of course. The whole thing felt rushed, so it was hard to process everything and I did not like everyone asking for tips. It cheapened the experience for me. I would have loved to have some along time to explore the island and the prison area more, but after the prison tour we were rushed off to the boat that was about to leave us.

The ferry staff were very helpful getting the scooter on and off the ferry, One has to book the tickets in advance with a credit card- take your credit card to the ticket office on the day you go to Robben Island,so that they can check the numbers. We forgot to do this, and had to pay full price again, as they wanted to see the Credit Card for security of payment reasons. We later got the money paid back into our Credit Card Account.An ex prisoner took as round the prison (inside and out). We saw Nelson Mandela's cell, the bathrooms, the football pitch, the quarry, and the offices. He also explained about the methods of education used and codes used between prisoners, He also explained how some prisoners were treated worse than others (political categories of prisoner) and showed us the diet allowances. He also told us how some prisoners went blind quarrying lime in the baking hot sun with no eye protection. he pointed out that the prison was like a university, because nearly all prisoners were extremely well-educated, including Nelson Mandela, The cells themselves consisted of one blanket on the floor, a drum for a toilet, bars on the doors, no windows, and very little room to move! I am now trying to get Nelson Mandela's autobiography as a result of this!We were also told how the prison finally became a tourist attraction in the late nineties. I do not fully understand how ex prisoners are brave enough to take tourists round the areas where they were once imprisoned. Food for thought!Gregory Chapman"

The Boat was 30 minutes late Tourists waiting in queues with no explanation..Once arrived everybody was rushed off to the buses Couldn't help but notice on the pier the shop was closed. Little did I know it was only the beginning. Besides being whisked off like sheep in a paddock. I couldn't help but notice the extreme degradation of the flora and buildings lack of maintenance with weeds everywhere, rubble and litter in comparison the Island served no purpose other than to shock you how bad apartheid really was. The sad thing is in the New South Africa Robben Island was the only piece of history still living in post apartheid. Maybe the CEO instead of trying to elevate his political position by advertising onboard with a brief video on his success with the Island. He should actually catch the trip himself and visit the derelict Island he calls a Heritage sight. It should be shut-down! Again South Africa sends the wrong message to us as overseas visitors.

Our bus tour was conducted by a very aggressive woman who spent most of the time interrogating and berating us for our lack of knowledge. At the end she informed us we could tip her if we wished - needless to stay noone on the bus accepted this invitation. Our second guide who had been a prisoner was much more sympathetic and indeed knowledgeable. Without going in to detail I felt that the whole experience could have been much better if a little more effort had gone into the presentation and planning of the tour. Indeed, at the end I felt as if I had been processed as quickly as possible through a factory line which needed sorting out and modernising."

The descriptions of life in the prison given by the ex prisoner guides are chilling. The most poignant place on the island is the quarry with the pile of stones at the entrance left by Nelson Mandela and the former prisoners. Yes, there are things which could be done better but so many museums around the world have been clinically cleaned up removing the sense of historic reality. The prison here looks like the prisoners have only just left and that makes it really memorable. The weather was rough and the boat journey was harrowing and although we were terrified it actually made the experience more real as we could try to imagine the utter fear of people going out there as inmates and as visitors. So glad we went. Don't think I could do the boat journey again!!!"

Although its notoriety comes mainly from its role as a prison during apartheid it has also served as a leper colony and a ww2 base. However, the tours to Robben Island are abysmal. The ferry ride takes about 45 mins and as soon as you reach the island you are herded into a bus and driven around for an hour while a guide points out the major features. Following this there is a tour of the prison done by a prior inmate. The bus ride felt rushed, I would have preferred to have walked with an audio guide, there were several major sites that the guide didn't even mention. The prison tour was also incredibly rushed and the guide didn't really add anything which was disappointing. The place is also falling apart and it looks like any info graphics that were installed haven't been maintained or replaced since 1994. So much could be done to make it more interactive but as it is it's just empty cells and corridors. In some of the cells there are testimonies from the prisoners who inhabited them, but we didn't get enough time to read any. The island is also interesting from an ecological point of view with colonies of penguins and many pairs of oyster catchers, yet once again there was no time to look at these things and we were immediately herded back onto the ferry. There is no doubt that Robben Island represents an important piece of history, but the state of the tour was hugely disappointing. So much could be done to make it more exciting, interactive and informative- what a missed opportunity for this amazing site!"

He also stated that he felt that he had been left behind by the new governemnt and was resigned to do a job he hated because he could not find work anywhere else.

You then got to walk back to the ferry(a 5 min walk), and you could take a longer walk to look at the penguins. If you had time.

Then you arrive at Robert Sobukwe House and you are jarred by the smell and brightness of a freshly painted house! This theme continues at the maximum security prison (where the highlight and de rigueur photo op' of the whole trip is Nelson Mandela's cell), and all the walls are again freshly painted and the floor varnished! You are told by the guide that the prison did not have windows (just iron bars), but there are newly minted windows everywhere! The tragedy for me was that history had been erased. I expected to see everything as it was. I understand that with so many visitors everyday, there would be some amendments to the structures; but l would have thought that walkways etc would be in place to accomodate the tourist without detracting from the integrity of the site.

You are picked up on arrival by bus and taken around some parts of the island (which is quite large) and given the history of Robben Island vis a vis apartheid etc. Then taken to prison where ex-political prisoner takes you through the regime he experienced and finally to cells where Mandela was held. Vey interesting piece of history told by people who clearly know what they are talking about and show a great amount of passion on the apartheid issue. Glad we went."

The prison tour is excellent, the guide very informative and the museum is well done. The bus tour of the island was conducted by a very bored sounding guide who spoke to us as if to children and repeated everything at least twice. Only one stop was made - at a tuck shop, and we had to stay in the bus for the remainder of the tour. The bus tour part can definitely be improved. Robben island is such an important part of our history, i hope the tour can be improved."

I am suprised with other reviews saying they did not learn anything about the history of the Island or Nelson Mandela because our guide around the island and our guide for the prison tour did give us plenty of history and insight and on the prison tour there was ample opportunity to ask questions of the guide who had been a political prisoner himself which he was happy to answer. It left us both feeling humble at the conditions that these prisoners survived for numerous years and we both want to reread 'The Long Walk to Freedom' again. The only small negative for me was due to the numbers of visitors that want to go each day the bus tour part is quite crowded and not everyone has an opportunity to see the relevant points of interest. A good tip is to get to the departure gate early so that you can sit on the top deck of the boat as the view is fantastic and we did see seals on route."

Once you arrive at the island, you are herded into buses that will then show you around the village... you cannot get off or even take photos at each stop.. there is a nice stop for photos looking towards Cape Town and the guided visit with the former prisoner is very interesting (best bit of visit) however the visit is not as memorable as it should really be.

Our tour started with a bus ride of the island. It was nice to see the island but they don't let you off the bus to experience the sights. When you arrive back at the prison you are given a former prisoner as your tour guide. Our guide was just bad. I respect the torment he experienced in the prison but he didn't help tell the story about life in the prison. He just yelled and told us who was held here. The prison is lacking a theme. For example it would be nice to have the cells set like they would have been in 1980 when Nelson Mandela was there. This would have helped the tourist understand the prison life much more. Instead what you get are freshly painted empty cells. Only a few have furniture. Nelson Mandelas cell is set up sort of like when he was there. Save your money and your time and skip this tour. You'd be better off spending your money on a $70 helicopter ride."

We were not allowd off the bus and so when they talked about a sight on the opposite side to where I was sat I could not see and could not take photos. We then had a tour of the prison and despite the guide (ex prisoner) talking english I could not understand him very well at all.The best part and most informative was the video film shown on the boat!I think this has become a money making initiative rather than a historic learning experience."

We were finally brought to the maximum security prison where the political prisoners were held for such a long time. Here we had a guide who had been a political activist although he told us he had been arrested for sabotage we didn't know exactly what he had done. It was good to have him as our guide because he had first hand experience if the conditions etc. although as he said by the time he was there conditions were so much improved from when Nelson Mandela was first there. His accent was hard to understand at times and as the first part is sitting in one if the communal cells listening to him for 30mins it was hard not to nod off to sleep. Seeing Mandelas cell was humbling - it's like a cupboard!!!On the whole the experience was good but the island is small and I am sure they could do it differently.

As a boat load arrives the passengers fight for a coach - there is no-one organising a queue or indeed telling us how many coaches there will be. You think there are no more and another one appears round the corner. Visitors NEED TO KNOW. The information you get from the guides will vary depending on the guide. I suppose this is inevitable. Our bus guide was really excellent, very informative, amusing and clear in speech. One frustration is that there are big information boards at some coach stops but only on one side. There is no time to get out so only one side of the bus can see them. The prisoner guide we had was really hard to understand and also was hurrying us along because there were other groups ahead of and behind us doing the same route.The ferry (catamaran) we had was good - no problems there.The staff at the ferry terminal in Cape Town were not helpful.

I am concentrating on keeping my breakfast down when suddenly I hear it. I look up at the sea of green faces and hear people moaning and throwing up. It is like a chain reaction, one after another. The sounds and smells are triggering more and more people to give up their stomach's contents, and there is absolutely no shame. I kid you not, at least 20 people were throwing up at the same time. It was like a sick movie. People are crawling over each other in a desperate effort to get outside, above deck, but the waves are so intense that you have to ping yourself between a pole, a table, a person, anything you can grab onto or else you are going to be tossed 6 feet with the next wave. I ping myself towards the door leading to the outside deck in a frantic effort to escape the madness (and to have a bit of dignity when I do the inevitable: vomit off the side of the ferry into the ocean). I finally make it to the rail, in the knick of time. After shamelessly doing my thing into the water far below I look up, feeling slightly relieved, only to see a MASSIVE rogue wave hurtling in my direction. I stare at it dumbfounded, still wiping my mouth with a crumpled kleenex that I dug up from my pocket, as it literally washes completely over me. Over my head, it rushes in and hurtles me into the side of the ferry. I am seriously lucky it didn't wash me overboard- it was that huge. Covered in salt water, freezing cold, eyes burning, stomach seizing, and with the remnants of breakfast clinging to my soaked jacket, I see Robben Island in the distance. The tour wasn't worth the misery. I couldn't hear the tour guide, the snack shop didn't offer anything of sustainance, and quite frankly I was sort of bored- and I LIKE historical places.Now for the ferry back to the mainland."

On the island wie were directed to buses, and a nearly 45 min bus tour with a good guide explained the history of the island and showed some interesting corners. That was followed by a guided tour through the high security prison, this was made by a former prisoner, he was very interesting and also told his story. Everybody will visit also Nelson Mandelas jail cell, and we were impressed by these buildings and how the Apardheid dealt with the political prisoners. The transport to the mainland was also on an older boat, and that was my major complaint: nobody counted the people entering, and we had the idea of a very unsafe trip on this boat, as well as many others!

We only discovered this when we arrived for our 10am departure. The trip over (particularly on the old boat) can be very rough so I suggest take precaution to avoid sea sickness, my advice sit outside in the fresh air. There was also no instruction provided on the location of life jackets or what to do in the event of an emergency. Upon landing on the island it was chaos, there were plenty of people standing around (locals on the island) but no assigned dedicated tour staff to provide instruction of where to go, this was further hindered by having a school group in attendance. Service can be dramatically improved here. Once we found our tour bus the information provided was interesting but lacking the historical detail I would have liked to learn & hear more about. The area although a world heritage site seemed poorly maintained and run down in places and points of particular interest & historical significance like the limestone quarry for instance you could not exit the bus to view in close detail.The tour & talk provided by an actual ex prisoner was great and overall the highlight of the trip (this was the best part). Sadly the overall island experience itself from start to finish has the potential to be fantastic if Senior Management only made the effort to pay a little more attention to guests and coordinate a more well planned, better organised, more structured informative tour of the island. Do this and you will have an awesome tour!"

A visit to Robbin Island should be a priority when in Cape Town as it will give you a good understanding of life under the apartheid regime and the struggle for freedom. Be sure to make a reservation in advance! Not only do you get to see Mandela's prison cell but he boat ride is lovely, you get lovely views of Cape Town and Table Mountain from the island and you get to see some interesting wildlife!"

We prebooked tickets almost 2anniversary months in advance to ensure that we got the date and time we wanted. There was a sign when we arrived (July 20th) that it was booked until August 1st! We were taken thru security and onto the boat. Now for someone who has lived on an island (Long Island, NY) for my entire life I've never been sea sick. But boy did this trip change all that! It wws misty before our 9amtrip take off and with a storm approaching the sea got very choppy. Sitting indoors (because outdoor standing would result in you getting soaking wet) near the front of the boat was a bad idea! 3 out of my 4track friends got ill and needed sea sick bags. Many others around us needed the same.Arrived on the island and was allowed to use the restroom and get on large buses to the prison. Once at the prison, a former prisoner toured us around- providing great insight into the daily lives of prisoners as well as the prison system at the time and apartheid. (I would suggest reading Nelson Mandela's book Long Walk to Freedom- or atleast excerpts during his prison stay). Then we were back on the bus for a 45min tour of the island. Our guide, Wendy, I believe, was fabulous! After a bathroom,snack and curio stop we headed back to the boats.Might I recommend sitting on the lower deck on the boat near the back. A MUCH less rocky location where no one got sick. Besides that and the chilly, rainy weather, it was fabulous. "

Everyone should get to visit Robben Island at least once.Our ferry ride was fine and turned out to be the best part of the trip.As a lot of other people have stated, you are herded like cattle from ferry onto stuffy, hot busses, off busses, through prison, back onto ferry.75% of the time we were stuck on a hot, stuffy bus. We were parked more than we were on the move. We had to wait for the bus in front of us to move before we could.Our guide was quite good but went on and on and on. The bus goes around the island - they point out various places of interest along the way. There is one stop for a photo opportunity. The bus then drops you off at the prison and an ex inmate takes over the tour. This was slightly more interesting although I felt it went on way too long. Then all of a sudden it was over and I couldn't believe the guide didn't point out Mr Mandela's cell. Afterall, I'm sure everyone who goes there wants to see that above anything else.The tour went on so long we were late for the ferry. I heard a lot of people complaining about not having time to visit the shop.Incredibly disappointing experience. I really hope they improve the tour in the future."

The day we went was a bit misty and ride in the boat was chilly. The thing that struck us as strange was that, apparently Robbens Island has two boats -- one is an open air boat that we were on and the other is a nice catamaran style indoor boat that was sitting at the dock. The day we went was chilly and misty and they still loaded everyone up on the open air boat - which was fairly uncomfortable for the long ride out to the island. I'm also fairly sure that there was more people on the boat than the boat actually accomodates comfortably but I can't be totally certain. During rainy weather you would think that the enclosed vessel would be used.The good... the tour itself was interesting and the portion of the tour that was in the actual prison was conducted by one of the former political prisoners. The bus takes you around the island and stops at a few locations explaining the history of the island before stopping at the prison area (which is the last part of the tour)."

Last Wednesday four of my relations who are staying here for a fortnight went to the Robben Island terminal and purchased 4 tickets for the 11-00 sailing on Saturday, on arrival they were informed that the trip was cancelled due to rough weather, with which they had no argument, but when they asked for a refund they were asked to provide a bank statement with the banks stamp on it, they explained that like most tourists, they were not in the habit of carrying bank statements with them on holiday and that they had paid in cash, not credit card. An offer on another date was offered but as they were flying back that night this was on no use.  The lady in charge, Nomachina, at one stage turned her back on them and walked off disappearing through a door used by staff. My relations then approached the tourist info who were most helpful and who contacted Robben Island and explained that what they were doing was wrong, the clients paid in cash and should be refunded in same manner, they got stonewalled as well. Two other tourists in the same predicament gave up and wandered off, fed up with arguing. When I finished work I went down the see what was happening and got the same, no cash refunds, OK, so I left my bank details so I could get the refund and forward it on to the UK, on Monday morning I get a E Mail from Robben Island asking for a bank statement with the banks stamp attached, so they expect me to go to my bank, get a stamped statement, drive down to the waterfront and present them with it. What kind of scam is being operated here when cash disappears and they know full well tourists are here for a short time and most will give it up as a bad job and go away very disgruntled. My grandson said it should be renamed \"Robben so and so's\"  As a tour operator I get more complaints about Robben Island than any other of our tourist sites put together. I have now turned to the consumer rights panel for help.Thomas MurrayCamps Bay."

After a 45 minutes bus tour on the island and a short time spent with an ex political prisoner who shared some of his own experiences and showed Nelson Mandela's cell for two seconds, there was no time left to wander around and to take in and reflect on the experience as a whole. We left the island with a bitter taste and we felt that there is very little learned during this trip. The most we liked were the breathtaking views of Cape Town and the Table Mountain during the boat trip to and back the island but this is not what you are aiming for during such a visit.

The ride to the island was about 45 minutes and was terrible. My wife and I have never gotten sea sick before, but both of us were feeling nauseous only 10 minutes into the trip. Definitely stay out on the top deck if you can. We were not alone either. It seemed like everyone on the boat was sick. After docking we were immediately ushered to busses which is last place we wanted to be given our nausea.The tour guides were very knowledgeable and really made the trip. However, the experience is very limited and the time on the island was very short. The trip back was not nearly as bad.Overall, it was disappointing. Perhaps when they finish with walking/bike paths there may be more to do on the island and it may be a more enjoyable trip."

The guide on my bus, named MP, is a real funny man. He brought life to the bus with his many jokes incorporated into his guide speech. Downside was the people at the back had problems hearing him as the PA system in the bus was down. After a 35 mins bus ride around the island, we are dropped off at the political prison cell for a guided tour with an ex political prisoner. This is where things were downhill. Tho the content were meaningful, the delivery could be better. There was not much of a \u201cpersonal experience sharing session\u201d but more of a bam wham fact fact fact content which can easily be found on wikipedia. We were made to sit in this long communal cell where the guide speaks in his monotone, followed by a few 5 mins walking down the cells, a few minutes over Nelson Mandela\u2019s cell for photo taking and lastly 10 mins in the bare courtyard. Our group (6 person) came off the island feeling a little shortchanged. Too commercialized as we were allowed more time at the gift shop than the cells."

After taking the ferry over we were herded onto buses, taken around the island and then given a tour of the maximum security part by a former political prisoner. So many people were there with their big fancy cameras jostling for position. When Ben, the former inmate, started talking to us it was like being at a press conference with all the cameras going off. There were some very thoughtful questions raised by people in our group which I was thankful for, not having any of my own. The time with Ben didn't feel rushed and I learned a lot from hearing him speak. And then the 'obligatory' photo of Mandela's cell. If it were up to me I would ban photography of the facilities on the island. You can buy a postcard just as easily. I would also allow time for people to wander through in their own good time. Maybe an audio guide could be used to help people who don't speak English but want to know what's going on. But rush, rush, rush and back to the ferry. There were some Capetonians on the ferry whose work had paid for their day out but I haven't met any other South African who's been there. This is a real shame because Robben Island should serve as a reminder of what it once was. The people who fought and suffered there deserve respect instead of being treated as show ponies by greedy business people who only want to make money."

We weren't given the opportunity to reflect on the many stories posted on the walls of cells but were constantly chivvied and hustled along until we got to the communal area where we were subjected to a 20 minute lecture on the political situation during apartheid. I imagine that most of the visitors had a fair idea of the situation and that's why they were there. We then had a bus tour of the island which was only marginally interesting.

Views from open area on top deck of ferry are fantastic, but the wind can be horrendous. Hats and even eyeglasses can be blown away. Buses were waiting on the island, and the guide was an ex-convict from the prison. The process of getting into the prison was a bit hurried, but the pace slowed once we were inside. There is quite a lot of walking and standing, so wear comfortable shoes. The groups are large, and there were several people who didn't understand English very well. Maybe they need more multilingual guides.Our guide was patient with them and repeated comments as necessary, but this slowed the whole process.Learning that political prisoners were considered more dangerous than murderers really made me think about the importance of ideas and how fortunate I am to live in a country where ideas, even unpopular ones, can be freely expressed. I came away from this place with a new appreciation for freedom of speech and thought. When the tour ends, you are invited to visit a penguin colony on the island, but we didn't have (or take) the time, as we were afraid we would miss the next ferry back to Cape Town. I suppose we could have waited for another one, but it was late afternoon and the schedule details were a bit enigmatic. A ferry came, so we boarded it.

Go early in the morning, book online and choose the newer ferry the Sikhululekile, more comfortable and stable especially when it gets windy and the trip can get rocky."

            "review": "OK but could be better. I visited Robben Island today for the first time, having lived in Cape Town since 1994 and in South Africa all my life. The format was basically as follows:1. Ferry ride from the Waterfront to Robben Island (30 minutes),2. Guided bus trip around the Island (1 hour 30 minutes),3. Guided tour of the Political Prisoners Prison itself (1 hour),4. Ferry ride from Robben Island back to the Waterfront (30 minutes).For the most part it was an interesting tour; but there was not much time to actually explore the island apart from sitting on a bus and being shuttled from one point-of-interest to another. When at any of these points-of-interest, there is a minor \"scuffle\" of buses to get to see the attraction. You hardly get out the bus at all, so most photos have to be taken from inside and the windows are not very clean, so the photos have interesting lines to them. Having said that, the guide on the bus was very entertaining and she gave a lot of useful information in a witty and charming manner. The guide in the prison itself was rather long-winded and seemed to draw the tour out far longer than the other groups. All-in-all, I would recommend doing the tour - both for tourists and for fellow South Africans.Having read some of the other reviews of this past month, I am very grateful that the ferry was working today and we made it out and back safely."

On arrival to the harbour, you get on a bus, which drives you to all the key places on the island, with a guide explaining everything along the way. You get to stop at one point with the view of Table Mountain and lions head - a stunning picture! Then you get escorted round the prison building by an ex political prisoner - my husband am I were moved to tears by his story, I think his name wasstando mbata (not sure of spelling). The boat ride is 30 mins each way, leaving 2 hours for the tour. We didn't get time to go and see the penguins, and in places it did feel a bit rushed - to improve this tour they could add an extra 30-60 minutes as it would enable both the guides and customers to relax a bit more! If you are in Cape town you must do this - we nearly didn't go and were appalled by this fact once the tour was over! A real highlight of our trip we learnt a lot and as I said, found it to be a very moving and thought provoking experience"

            "review": "Very Poor Service. We live in Cape Town and have been hearing some very bad reports about the Robben Island trip, things like the tour itself is not very good, the boat service is unreliable and the staff rude. All of this is very sad as this is perhaps the most important bit of recent South African history and the thing nearly every tourist to the country wants to see and further more should see in order to learn from the experience. But we have had a number of people who have stayed with us who have failed to be able to make the visit, not through their own fault but by cancellation of boats. The most recent example was our son and girlfriend who had booked and paid to visit the island on Friday and only when they were about to get onto the boat did they find out that it had been cancelled, so they swopped their tickets for the 9am ferry on Tuesday. They got up early traveled to the port only to find that that ferry had been cancelled and no one had informed them, despite having emails and various telephone numbers to contact them by. To boot the 11am ferry was fully booked and there was limited space on the 3pm ferry, then no space at all for the next 5 days. To top it all the staff were absolutely down right rude, almost arrogant. This is not the way to run a world heritage site, its not the way to treat tourists who have travelled half way around the world to see Robben Island and it certainly is not the way to delivery the historically important experience that Robben Island offers. Okay boats can break down, but there should be systems in place to make sure that all booked passengers get across to the island and others given warnings of cancellations, when people are here for a limited amount of time they cannot afford to spend days getting messed about by this poor service. Finally there is NO excuse for rude staff, this experience is one of the biggest shop fronts for modern South Africa having a lot of contact with locals and oversees visitors. On present performance the staff are giving a very sad impression of modern South Africa. If the staff don't want to work there find some that do, I imagine there would be a big queue of people waiting to work there. So if you are planning to visit Robben Island, book in advance, keep phoning to find out if the boats are running and hope you are told the truth because we were not and finally keep your fingers crossed that it will actually happen."

We exchanged our web tickets on arrival at the customer service desk - the staff were surly with attitude for no apparent reason. Even a hello was too much trouble. We then hoped to walk around the various displays that were part of the departure point to pass away the 40 or so minutes before the ferry... EVERY feature was \"out of order\"; the auditorium on ground level was just turned off, the prisoners experience was roped off and the movie on the lower level also \"out of order\". The staff were sat on their computers on the lower levels behind a closed glass screen on facebook (for the full 40 minutes that we whiled away). No explanation about why all of these exhibitions happened to be closed. We then queued for 40 minutes to wait for our 11am ferry. At 10.55 we received our safety instructions from a member of staff and were ready to board... Lo and behold 5 minutes later an announcement was made - the ferry was cancelled. The announcement was muffled and most people stood around looking at each other asking what was happening. It turns out that a part was needed for the boat so it couldnt run. However, the boats the day before had been cancelled too. Why they had made 50 or so people wait around for a little under an hour the following day, and put them through a safety briefing, before announcing that the boat was still not working I have no idea. When I attempted to politely ask a member of the information desk team what was happening she put her hand in my face, turned round after tutting and then walked off to avoid having to answer anyone's questions. Absolutely appalling. Given what this museum represents the service and attitude of its staff is a crying shame."

Having last visited South African when Mandela was imprisoned on Robben Island it was good to come back and see the place first-hand. A very interesting tour. Boats departs from the pier just behind the clock tower and takes about 20 minutes to get there. You may not want to rush with the others and sit on top as the winds can be very strong and the temperature cool. The crossing can be rough if the waves are high. Sit on the second deck and then you can step out on the back for some nice views without committing to the upper deck. Tour is 2 parts. First on the bus with a local guide who explains all of the main sites. Then you get off and have a tour of the main political prison with an ex-prisoner. The island tour was too fast and we would have enjoyed some more stops along the way. The prisoner tour was interesting and you felt the emotion of having someone who had stayed in the cells show you around vs a young tour guide. A living testimony to an uglier time in the country's history.If you want to visit the penguins when the prison tour ends hurry along towards the pier and then veer to your left and at the end is a covered platform where you can see them. We were the only ones in our group to do so. Binoculars or a powerful zoom lens would help.Tip: Book online and do so early on in your visit to Cape Town as if the water is too rough to go and the tour is cancelled you can re-schedule for another time. The same rule applies to visiting Table Mountain! It is apparently also the only place in the world where one can view two UNESCO World Heritage sites at the same time."

Seeing the island and visiting the prison was very interesting, thought provoking and certainly worth doing, but sadly, I came away rather disappointed. I felt that the full potential of the place had not really been exploited. Our first guide, on the coach, was rather too full of himself and eager to show everyone how important and how funny he was. As a result he failed to inspire us with a real sense of the history of the Island and all that happened there. The second guide, at the prison, rushed us through and seemed to be on autopilot and keen to get his bit done as quickly as possible. He was difficult to hear in these circumstances and he gave us too little time to contemplate the amazing resilience of Mandela and his colleagues and their appalling suffering. Obviously, it's a great idea to employ former prisoners to relate their experiences as guides, but I came away feeling that it could have been done so much better with a little more investment in training and in modern museum techniques and with a little more imagination."

The former prisoner was articulate and moving, projecting strongly for the 40 some visitors in our group. This part of the tour is supplemented by a 30 minute boat ride to and from the island (in nice weather go to the upper deck, with beautiful views of the city and Table Mountain). The 50 minutes touring the island is pleasant with an engaging guide but only context. The experience does not attempt to set forth the broader battle to end apartheid or even the negotiations of Mandela's eventual release - for that one goes, ideally, to the Apartheid Museum in Johannesburg. But what it does it does well. Book on-line in advance to be assured a place. The line to board is long but at the set time it moves amazingly quickly through a light security check and on board."

I actually shudder to even hear the name. My husband and I bought tickets online because we heard it sells out in advance. They charge for every individual regardless of age, so we had to buy a ticket for our 1-yr.-old daughter, too. USD $70 total for the three of us. I did not read the fine print that the tickets are non-refundable, non-transferable, etc. and that you have to show up minimum 10 min. prior to departure; in our case 10:50 for an 11:00 a.m. departure. We found ourselves running down the boardwalk the morning-of with minutes to spare until 11:00, and the departure museum/office in sight with the huge boat readying to leave the dock. As we were almost in front of the venue, the front wheel of the three-wheel jogging stroller I was running with, pushing my daughter in, caught between two planks in the boardwalk. The stroller came to an immediate halt and flipped over forwards, and I fell over it. Diners at a cafe beside us gasped, I quickly righted the stroller and found my baby daughter screaming, with a cut on her forehead and quite shaken, but luckily not seriously injured. My husband and I tried to console her, as the tour ship began to pull away from the dock. We walked the last few yards to the building, my daughter sobbing the whole way, and explained to the ticket office that we just missed this boat, our daughter just had an accident, and could we please stand by for the next tour? The women at the ticket counter were rude and simply said no. We explained again, and said we were running here and didn't realize boarding opened prior to 11:00; was there any way to transfer our ticket to the later tour, or to stand by for another day during our vacation? They again simply said no. We asked to speak to a manager, and we were told she \"was busy.\" We were very upset at this point, my daughter was still shocked and crying, and they refused to get the manager. They got someone on the phone, and said it was the manager, but one of the ticket ladies seemed to be in a casual conversation with her (in a local language). We waited, but they did not pass us the phone or seem to be talking to her about our situation. I was sickened by this treatment, hurt by the loss of $70 without even a \"sorry, I wish there was something we could do, but those are the rules, in fine print right on your ticket\", and upset about my daughter being hurt and for nothing. We didn't wait any longer and just left, feeling quite disgusted by the whole operation. I will likely never have a chance to visit Cape Town again in my life, and if I do, I still would never go on this tour, I am still offended and appalled by the treatment we received."

Extremely inportant site to see where Mandela and so many other leaders and participants in the struggle for independance and equality built their new country. Book ahead by at least one day (more during the tourist season) on their website. The journey starts from the Capetown Waterfront and proceeds by ferry to Robben Island. You transfer to buses and do not get off. At the end you have a conducted tour through the prison and back to the ferry. Outstanding moments were seeing the cave where the first government \"in excile\" was formed protected by the nonintrusion into lav policy under aparteid! Great moment for a political junkie. Second was the tomb of a major iman whose death lead to an increase in African muslims. The role played by rugby-soccer in developing national leadership and global attention explains the SA passion for the game. The negatives are that the control by the former prisoners and gvernment guides leads to long periods of tedium as the polemics are beaten into your head. As one who remembers Sharpesville and Bilko and other great leaders who died in the 1960s, it was depressing to be harrangued. The lack of opportunity to get off the bus for photographs and the inability to see and be guided to birds and nature was also a challenge. In all a worth the experience."

Our guide was a nice enough person but tended to entertain the bus with jokes about nationalities rather than givng us the history of the place, so much so, that our tour of the actual jail had to be cut short due to a lack of time which is ashame as the jail guide was a former inmate with lots of interesting points to make. With a better bus guide we would have rated higher."

By the time we were \"allowed\" off the bus to tour the facility on foot with a very dignified ex-inmate, it was too late.

The guides are ex political prisoners who speak with great passion about Nelson Mandela, the prison and its political significance. Robben Island isn't a theme park, so don't expect a polished tourist experience. Some of the guides have heavy accents which can be difficult to understand, the buses are overcrowded and the prison tours sometimes resemble a scrum as 40 people try to cram themselves into narrow corridors and small spaces. But don't let that put you off - it is somehow appropriate to the raw, real life experience that this place represents."

There an ex-political prisoner greets you and guides you through the different sections of the prison. All the guides provide a very honest account of political struggle and everyday life of the prison. They are also willing to answer any question you pose them so don't be shy! I was impressed with the manner in which the whole tour was conducted. There was a sense of peace and reflection, not resentment or prejudice over what had occurred during apartheid. It was very inspiring to be able to talk to an ex-politcal prisoner in person and see that he was not bitter from the experience but celebrating freedom and hopeful for the future. It was also a great learning experience and the guides were very knowledgeable in how other countries had provided various support for the freedom struggle over the years. I even learnt what my own country had contributed.All in all a very inspiring experience and one I thoroughly enjoyed!"

I had been told you always had to book weeks in advance, however, I was able to get tickets on the Friday for the trip on Sunday. The boat looked pretty full on the day, though, so maybe I was just lucky.The trip starts with a coach tour round the island. You don't get much of a chance to get off until you arrive at Robert Sobukwe's house. He was placed under house arrest here under a special clause passed by the government. This I found one of the more moving parts of the tour, as the letters he wrote to his family are on display and some of the nobility and bravery of the man comes through. The other part I found very moving was seeing the lime quarry where the prisoners were made to work, in the blinding conditions which were visible even from the coach.The last part of the tour is around the maximum security prison itself. It has not been tarted up at all - you won't find any actors in prison uniforms pretending to be Nelson Mandela, or anything tacky like that. In fact, it is easy to believe that only yesterday it was still being used as a prison. Even Mandela's old cell has not been in any way glamourised. This is a good decision - the events are too recent and still too raw to be trivialised.It was hard to follow what the tour guide in the prison was saying because of the numbers on the tour and the fact he had a strong accent. However, he did his best and it is striking to think that you are being shown round by a former inmate. Perhaps people could be given something to read which might help them follow the tour better? I'm thinking especially of non-native English speakers and people who are hard of hearing.There is a different atmosphere on Robben Island, which my guidebook called \"otherworldly\". It certainly retains its memories and its ghosts. It may not be a laugh a minute, but I don't think anyone would regret coming here."

For a place that is so significant in the history of the country, and rightly a World Heritage Site, the management are doing an extremely poor job of realising the opportunities to explain that history and to really inform, educate and engage visitors. Obviously everyone wants to see and hear about the prison and when you eventually get to it, the prison guides themselves are amazing and inspiring. But the problem is there is very little time for that. We spent about 45 mins of the hour-long visit either waiting for or sitting on a hot, crowded bus trundling round the island looking at other (not very interesting) things. The guide on the bus was terrible. Much of his commentary had nothing to do with Robben Island, or consisted of lame and irrelevant jokes and anecdotes. Cringeworthy. And unbeknownst to us (there was no explanation at all during the very disorganised and time-consuming bus loading process) half our passengers were Swiss so everything the guide said (including all the stupid jokes) was then repeated by the Swiss tour guide leader. And because neither had a microphone the bus had to stop for each doubled-up commentary otherwise the guides could not be heard above the engine. Without air-con this meant it was ridiculously hot, and that the tour took ages. All the non-Swiss speakers on the bus were cranky and many actually complained about how long it was taking, but he just brushed this off and carried on. When we made a toilet stop we actually got off and found a different bus \u2013 the guide on the second one was much better \u2013 and had a microphone...The tour of the prison itself was by a former prisoner who was great, and gave a bit of insight into what that experience was like. This was indeed very moving. But it felt quite disrespectful for this part of the tour to be so short, rushed and crowded. There was no time to look around on our own before we had to rush back to the ferry.We were also very surprised that there is no museum here, or even any small exhibition (even though it is called Robben Island museum). This is such a missed opportunity. We were imagining what a great museum could be built on this site \u2013 telling the history of Robben Island and linking to the broader anti-apartheid struggle, with pictures, explanation, videos, artefacts and so on. People could then wander around (in their own time!) and get a deeper insight. From comments we overheard from other visitors, many people are quite ignorant about the context and history and are just doing this tour because it\u2019s a \u2018must-do\u2019. A well-designed, interactive museum would really help to educate and engage people, meaning they might get a lot more out of their visit than being able to say \u2018I saw Nelson Mandela\u2019s cell\u2019.We came away saddened and perplexed by the massive lost opportunity here.

Access to and from the island is much better than the old ferry, but it means far greater numbers of visitors. Once on the island, most of the time was spent on the bus and although the live commentary was by ex-inmates much of it was nothing to do with Robben Island. Time in the prison itself was minimal and there was a crush as busload after busload arrive at Mandela's cell with only a few minutes between - so you get about 5 seconds to peer in before moving on. A disappointing visit compared to the 'old' days."

The bus tour was great: we had a very informative and personable guide who gave us much information aand answered all our questions. Our guide through the prisons was not as good: too rote, memorized talk, didn't wait for the people at the end of the line before starting his talk in the next area, didn't ask if anyone had any questions, and rushed off at the end after accepting tips at the door. The bus tour guide was the best! Penguins at the end were distant and it was raining again. Still, an inspiring trip with lots of history."

Then they let you wait for 45 min until you can get back on the boat, perfect time to buy expensive drinks or souveniers.You have the feeling you have to tip every guide all the time. Some of them make a hell lot of money. In my group were 50 people, everyone gave something.I dont know if you have seen places like dachau or auschwitz, robben island is paradise island.

Once we arrived we were put on buses which went around the island and showed a couple of interesting site (quarry where Mandala worked). The we did a brisk walk through the maximum security prison lead by an old inmate. This was like walking through a old warehouse with a guy telling you what it was like.At 5:00pm as we were about to leave, the boat was loading people on board and we were told we had enough time to go to the toilet etc. We came back 5 minutes later and people were rushing to the boat and then an announcement came over saying the boat was for staff only. That left 50 people on the wharf with the shops both closed and no shelter. The 1 person at information kept saying \"a boat is on its way\" for 45 minutes. Finally a boat turned up and took us back but by this time the sun was setting and it was one of the older boats with little in door space. Due to the delay we had to wait in the harbour in freezing winds while a cruise ship left.When we went back the next day, the weekend manager looked shocked and gave us email addresses to contact and when we got back home we sent of the emails and didn't get any response for a couple of months despite repeated emails.If you have the choice go to Alcatraz over Robbin Island, much better tour and way better organised."

I have been there on the standard tourist trip and also on a behind the scenes tour courtesy of a friend who tendered to be service provider. Virtually anything that can goes wrong, does go wrong, more often than not due to lousy attitude of staff and management who think they have one of the seven wonders of the world. Recently the overpaid staff of Robben Island went on strike demanding a 40% or more salary increase, and that they be allowed to ALL take a couple of weeks leave over the Christmas/New Year period, which is their busiest period of the year. Hello, it's a tourist operation.....they do half their turnover in two months of the year! There is so much that COULD be done with the Island as an important part of the history of SA, and particularly the overthrowing of apartheid. As a South African I was overjoyed at the overthrow of apartheid, I am saddened and embarrassed by what is presented to tourists as Robben Island. Everything at the Island, the gateway, and the administration of the operation is done amateurishly and badly. It really is a mess. As a sneak preview of the standards you might expect, have a look at any of the last few annual reports, available online. Its a badly run \"business\" and , again, just about anything that can go wrong, does, and quite seriously."

Bookings are advised during peak season.Most impressive is the tourguide in the prison off course. Every guide and ex-prisoner has his own story and these stories are shocking. The tour in the prison itself is not that impressive; there is not that much to see. I would advise to do some reading in the airplane to South Africa to make your experience more intense and maybe ask the guide some interesting questions.The tour on the island is a bit boring; you will see some spots with: \"here the prisoners did this and that\" and you will end up at the best point to see Cape Town and take some pictures.Final tip: at the end, when you have some minutes: walk to the 'left (prison in the back, looking to the ocean); after the man-made harbour there is a small rock-beach; populated with penguins!"

Insufficient buses were available to transport visitors from the harbour area to the prison site and those that couldn't find a seat had to walk. No-one seemed to be in overall control and instructions from the local reps (no uniforms or badges of identification) were conflicting and led to confusion. The tour was split into smaller groups to visit the prison; however, the numbers were still excessive and people were jammed into rooms to try and listen to the explanation from the guide - local accent and difficult to understand. Insufficient time was allowed to explore places of interest, I assume because of the sheer numbers involved and the need to move people through quickly. Refreshment facilities were very limited, as was the time available to make use of them. Altogether, a poor experience and not recommended."

The boat to the island is packed with people, it's a pleasant ride and on arrival you board a bus which takes you around the island. You get a feel for the place - the lime stone quarry where prisoners were working with the most primitive tools in the heat. You see the cave where those unable to read and write were taught basic skills by those who could. Part of the island is inhabited today though the local school was closed a couple of years ago.The second part of the tour takes you to the maximum security prison block - the tours there are conducted by ex prisoners - ours was a gentle man with a great sense of humour who had spent 5 years as a prisoner on the island. His presentation was matter of fact, there was no drama - but the place speaks for itself. On the floor were a couple of rugs the size of bath towels. He pointed to those to explain that this was the 'bedding' until an international commission stepped in and the rugs were replaced by bunk beds. You see Mandela's cell, you can walk the long corridors, you can enter the cells, you can walk around the courtyards where prisoners were allowed to enjoy the fresh air for 30 minutes ..........It is a special place - but it could be so much better:(1) the staff at the ticket office and in the information centre could do with a bit of training - they are not selling tickets to a fun fair, this is a place of national (and international) importance and they should feel part of it(2) the drive in a bus with lots of other people - and in our case a number of young and very unruly children - made me feel that we were part of a conveyor belt tourism, smaller groups would be much better. Discouraging visitors to take small children would be even better.(3) the walk through the prison would be better if it was done in silence - large group make a lot of noise (4) a creche for small children on the island would be great - the presentation by our wonderful guide was interrupted by squealing children who were too young to understand, who were bored and whose parents seemed too inconsiderate to care I could not help feeling that with a bit of thought, care and attention to detail a visit to Robben Island could become one of those experiences that stay with you forever.

We were advised to book in advance, as it can be hard to get tickets, so I phoned about a month before we were going and we were booked on the 11.00am tour on Wed 26 October. When we arrived in Capetown on the Tuesday, we checked out where the ferries departed from, to make sure we could find it the next day, and all seemed well. However, when we arrived the next morning to collect our tickets, there was a crowd of people singing and dancing in front of the ferry terminal, and it seemed to be some sort of protest. We were a little concerned, but the crowd was relatively peaceful and made no attempt to stop us going in to the centre. When we got in, we were told that there was no 11.00am tour. No explanation was provided, but we were offered an alternative at 1.00pm, which we accepted. We arrived back at the centre just before 12.30pm, as instructed, but instead of leaving at 1.00pm, the ferry boarding was so disorganised that we did not even get onto the ferry until 1.30pm, and did not leave Capetown harbour until almost 2.00pm. When we arrived on the other side, we were told to board one of four buses waiting by the quay. We sat on the bus for about a further half hour before it finally started taking us on a tour of the island. While the tour was interesting enough, we really wanted to see and hear about Nelson Mandela's time on the island. However, ours was the last bus to return to the high security prison, where he was kept, and our tour had only just started when some of the other tourists asked what time the ferry was due back out. Although we still had a good 45 minutes before it was due to leave, we were practically raced around the rest of the prison with no time to ask questions or take photos, so that we didn't miss the boat! We then sat on the ferry for another 30 minutes before it actually left.It was so disappointing that what should have been such an interesting and informative day was spoiled by shambolic organisation and lack of proper time managment. We learned later that a lot of the Robben Island staff were on strike the day we visited, which may have impacted on our experience. However, we weren't told that at the time, or warned that it might affect the tour."

The tour was done by former political prisioners who were remarkable for not having any bitterness over their imprisonment. In fact both were at pains to say that we (the tourists) should not think of Robben Island only as a prision, but think of it as a place of reconciliation and learning. Speaking of learning one of the interesting thing I learned is that Robben Island was also a leper colony. There is a African Peguin colony on the islandThe must do thing for me was to take a photo outside Nelson Mandella's cell. Make sure you purchase your ticket in advance. Also tour the exhibit in the Nelson Mandela Gateway building where the tour departs.The ride from the Cape Town to Robben Island is about 45 minutes but the seas seemed pretty rough. I sailed in the older boat which used to transport prisioners to the island."

What you get is some facts about the prison island itself and many facts about how life was in prison. You even see how the warders lifed and other uninteresting stuff. I think there is so much more to tell to the tourist coming to SA and especially as there is no apartheid museum in C. Anyway - we've been highly disapointed. The view on CT on the way back is nice."

The bus tour provided even more history and a full commentary was delivered beautifully by our guide - after viewing the quarries and the town along with various other attactions we were advised that many ex-prisoners had settled on the Island and now lived in friendship with the ex-guards. This in itself provided a positive end to the tour and hope for the future of this beautiful country and it's wonderful people."

When we finished this, we met the buses, who disgorged the other half of the party, and we went off on the bus tour of the island. VERY DISAPPOINTING INDEED. There was no explanation of the history of the island, we were driven in silence to various points, the leprosy graveyard, the quarry etc. but no explanation of any of the history of the island. found that out later from reading the roughguide book left back in the hotel room. We were dropped off again at the jetty half an hour before the boarding time and left there. No sign of the refreshment stop, nor any indication of the penguins or other natural attractions.

Our bus did the prison tour first. We were shown around by a former prisoner, which was pretty cool but he was really hard to understand. Because he was hard to understand my group felt that we missed a lot of the stuff he said and didn't learn much at all. At one point everyone went in different directions and he had to go around trying to get everyone back together.The bus tour around the island was horrible as well. They would point out certain things we passed but didn't give any history behind it. They would just say we're passing the postal office. I would've preferred to skip the tour around the island and spend more time at the prison to explore on our own. In the end I didn't learn too much about the history of Robben Island except for what i already knew. Our entire group said we would have to look it up later since the tour was useless. I was hoping to leave the tour feeling moved by the history but that didn't happen. I didn't even want to buy any souvenirs because i felt like i didn't make any connection with the place at all.It was very disappointing since we were looking forward to it. Looks like this is the only way to tour the place though and you can't not go to Robben Island when you're in Cape Town. They need to make some major changes to the tour."

Unfortunately for me becasue of how bad I was feeling the whole trip was overshadowed by a nervousness of travelling back to Cape Town mainland, however what I can say is the tour groups were too big, our guide who was an ex prisoner was in such a hurry that at times he left people behind whilst he stalked off to the next point of interest and for certain a lot of what he was saying would have been missed. the guide was difficult to understand, there is no way if you were foreign you would have understood what was being saidthe bus tour was very informative, we were shown around by 2 women and they answered questions knowledgably and coherentlyseeing the limestone \"university\" and the cells made you realise just what an inspirational man Nelson Mandela was and is to have survived and come out wanting equality and not the reverse apratheid as is evident in South Africa todayAll in all I would recommend this trip, its not something fun to do and probably not appropriate for young children either, but definitely worthwhile"

Well there's where he was so it is a place which needs to be seen . It's a very instructive experience ."

The guide didn't have the clearest English do the foreign guests among us struggled to understand him. This is a most trip if you are going to Cape Town but remember to book before you leave.

The tour was keen to point out that there have been prisoners on the island for hundreds of years but I felt that the most recent political prisoners were almost glossed over. All tours are conducted by ex political prisoners and to an agreed script. Whilst they tell you that they would be happy to answer any questions I felt the response would be considerably measured. Standing in the exercise yard was humbling and a stark reminder of recent events. However, I found the rest of the prison visit sanitised, as all the walls have been painted green and cream, and I had no sense that Nelson Mandela had ever been there, despite the fact that his cell is \"furnished\". I expected to feel overwhelming emotion during the prison part of the tour but this was not the case. Because of the greatness of the man you cannot go to Cape Town and not do this trip."

The second stop is at the prison where you are herded into an area where the acoustics are terrible and delivered a speech by a former prisoner that you cannot understand.My recommendation to the organizers is to equip the boat, buses and guides with a sound system.

Would love to see smaller buses or even the option of a walking tour of the island.. and smaller groups for sure. Plenty of guides available who could do with a job to do this so they really need to revisit this as it takes away from the experience. The part where a previous political prisoner does take you on a tour of the actual prison buildings is really great, so historic and moving.

He entertained, but his sense of humor was poignant. The prison guide had been incarcerated with Mandela. He walked with a brace, and the deprivation and torture of these prisoners hung in the air. Chilling and emotional. Each tiny cell had an inmate's photo and story posted. At Mandela's I took the guide aside to tell him I'd come to South Africa to honor Madiba; he waited till the rest of the group moved on, then left me alone at the cell for as long as I needed. (I found this very kind, as no doubt his job was to keep us together.) When I travel I want to know a place. In South Africa, I needed to come here."

As always - more is gotten out of the tour if you have done your own reading ahead of time. The guiding is OK, I would say barely acceptable and nothing more. But not much more can be expected from a tour that is very precise in its timing (because of boat schedules) and where tour groups are very large. Our group was about 50 people--a bus laod. I wish the Museum offered a longer (and more expensive) tour for those that are interested in a more in depth visit of the island as well as more interactions with the guides.

On the island itself - there is a school and a church with houses and we found out that ex prisoners AND guards now live there together! after you take the tour you will realise how amazing that is that they can simply co exist with one another after everything that happened in the prisons!After the main prison and seeing Nelsan Mandelas cell, they show you were the prisoners worked everyday for years on end. At the work place there was a little cave where they would sneak in one by one and write messages on the sand.. its all very inspiring and an experience you cannot miss! i would suggest this to all ages, the fascination just grasps you!"

The organization of the tours could be better, but I still think the island is worth going to see if you have even the slightest interest in its history. The tour consists of a boat ride to the island, a bus tour of the island and a walking tour of the prison. Our tour was actually cancelled because of bad weather, which happens a lot in winter, but we were able to rebook easily for the next morning. It's a pretty long tour, so I would recommend bringing snacks.POSITIVES: The boat ride was nice and had a good view of Cape Town. Kids, especially, will enjoy it. I thought the tour guides did a great job. The bus tour was funny and gave a bit of the island's history. The tour in the prison was given by a former inmate who was very informative and willing to answer questions and paint a picture of what it was like to be in the prison. NEGATIVES: The boat didn't leave on time, but after having our first tour cancelled, we were just happy it moved at all. Once in the prison, the tour groups are too large to hear the guide well and see Nelson Mandela's cell. On top of that, the last part of our group was still waiting to see the cell when another group crowded into the hall as well. The end of the prison tour in general was just too rushed. They have interesting little exhibits and information set up in some of the cells, but I was only able to see about three of them before they rushed us out."

Unfortunately it was poorly run when I did it in June 2011. I've been to about 35 countries and been on numerous tours. This tour was one of the biggest let-downs I can remember. For starters, getting on the boat was painfully slow due to the photographers taking pictures of everyone on the gangplank (30 rand upon return for the picture). We then sat on the main ferry in Cape Town with the engines running for about 15 minutes with no explanation. We eventually saw the captain run up to the boat and we then departed. Upon arrival we were toured around the small island in a bus to learn the history of the island from a guide named \"MP\". That was probably the best part. He spoke well and made himself available for questioning. Upon arrival at the prison our group of 20 combined with a group of about 50 to make a completely unmanageable group for the environment we were touring. The guide (an ex-prisoner for five years) clearly had a strong emotional tie to the area and had valuable stories to tell. But he was incapable of managing the group of 70. People pressed into cramped areas with poor acoustics trying to listen. His manner of speaking made it even more difficult to hear and understand what he was saying. His directions for the group were lacking, leaving the group of 70 wandering at times trying to figure out where they were going. At the pinnacle of the tour, Mandela's cell, he nearly left a large portion of the group until someone told him many people were still taking pictures. He regularly began speaking before the entire group was present and never organized the group for optimal presentation of his valuable stories. Since no one gave the typical \"The bathroom is here\" introductory speech, one woman ended up relieving herself in one of the courtyards while the rest of us wondered if we'd suffer the same fate. The guide said little of his own personal experience as a prisoner (though maybe I just couldn't hear it). I can't fault him for that and expect him to relate a painful tale. But if he isn't able for whatever reason then what's the value of him giving a sub-par tour? Upon leaving the gift shop and snack shop were already closed, much to the dismay of the large group. No one mentioned that the nearby buildings had more information that was worth looking at. Finally, we stood and waited another 15 minutes while the boat re-fueled. Why it waited to re-fuel I don't know. I was told that the tour is government run. If that's the case then the SA government is doing a dis-service to those former prisoners, despite employing some number of them as guides."

With hindsight, because it was a hot day and the busses they ferry you around on are not air-conditioned, we wished we had either gone earlier or later in the day.The tour of the island, once we got there was a bit of a mixed bag, in that we had a lady guide on the 45 min bus section of the trip who was a little too political in her \"aggressive\" story-telling (you almost felt you she was holding you responsible for any persecutions she had experienced in life). Yet, the former inmate who guided us round the internal part of the prison visit, was charming, charismatic and fascinating to listen to, whilst he told his life story and shared his experiences of prison life at Robben Island. Those 45 mins with him made it all worthwhile! He even continues to live voluntarily on the island with his family, with his day job being a tour guide on the prison visits....Inside the prison itself, you can access more than a dozen cells, each containing the heart-wrenching stories of the political prisoners who were incarcerated within these cells - well worth reading.This is no short trip, as you need to allow at least 4hrs, and to be honest some parts of it were spoiled by the patronising way in which the lady bus guide presented herself, but there is so much history in this place, that we felt it was a worthwhile trip to see where history was created, and to meet and talk to people like the ex political prisoner that we had the pleasure of meeting."

One of our guides commented that he had so much more that he wanted to tell us but he felt that the tours were rushed also. We didnt even have time to visit the gift shop! We did not have time to see the islands huge population of penguins either and felt a bit cheated by that. The trip over/back can be very bumpy if it is windy so if you dont have good sea legs be prepared. Overall it is a place that is definately worth a visit and I found it quiet emotional listening to some of the stories during the tour so i actually felt it was a bit disrespectful not to allow visitors the time to appreciate this world heritage site and its history."

The boat trip there gives for excellent views of Table Mountain. You can learn a lot from this tour and you can tell they are trying hard to preserve the history. There is a lot of information given on the past of South Africa and the prisoners of the jail. To be inside the prison itself and see what it was like is really interesting, especially as you also get to see Nelson Mandelas cell."

We were told that this was a necessary tourist attraction, but warned that the transport ferries were often delayed. I would say that both are true. Once on the island, the first portion of the tour is via tour bus with live audio guide. I felt this to be lacking seconday to an inability to clearly understand the guide and because there were numerous structures along the route that were not described.The last half of the tour was exceptional in that it was lead by an actual former inmate and political prisoner. His recollections of his time there were very enlightening and by far the most impactful of the attraction. He spoke of Mandela's influence and how it shaped the attitude of the whole prison.On our way back the ferry was delayed by ONE HOUR AND FORTY MINUTES!!! It's a good thing we didn't have any other plans that afternoon. Overall, it was worth it, but there is plenty of room for improvement."

The boat trip to the Island took about 45 minutes one way, and the guided tour of the island was about two hours. A former inmate was the tour guide around the prison and showed Nelson Mandela's old prison cell. The living conditions in the prison during the 1960s to 1980s were horrific, and during the visit to the Island you'll be able to see just that. No this is not an upgraded or elaborate museum as this was not the point. I thought it was very educational to hear the real life stories from the former inmate and I love the idea that they can be there to explain to tourists their views and feelings about this place."

If you want to understand a little more of modern South Africa, you have to visit Robben Island to understand just what its former white leaders subjected its black prisoners to. It's a low, featureless island a few miles off the coast, now all clean and polished for the 100s of daily visitors. And while that has robbed it of what must have been its old horrors, the understated and informative nature of the tour by a former inmate brings home what kind of place this was to be imprisoned for so many years. We didn't come away amazed or horrified - but we did come away wanting to learn more about how South Africa has achieved its astonishing journey of transofrmation over the last two decades. A final tip - there is a short, well illustrated, children's version of Nelson Mandela's autobiography available in bookshops in Cape Town - ideal for 8-10 year olds (though our six year old has just read and enjyed it) - do look it out and use it to teach your kids a bit more about how the world goes round, and what is right and wrong."

You are then told to sit quietly for at least one and half hours of the islands history. The Prison tour is at the end of the tour when again after sitting very quietly listen to an ex convict for 30 or more minutes. He did not speak good enough english to hold the audience attention and he could not be understood much of the time. Any Questions are at the end (if you were still awake by then) for a walk through the small prison rooms which had just been painted up nicely in a lovely two tone pastel green which did not give me a real feel of how it had been used in earlier and such depressing times. The organisers could have given us head sets in different languages, made more interactive things to keep our interest (and restless children)and expanded with more facts and pictures in print about the Leprosy sufferers who were forced to live on the Island and World War 2"

In stark contrast to the beautiful scenery in Cape Town, Robben Island is desolate, desert-like, and practically deserted, as the prison, which no longer has inmates, is pretty much the only thing on the island. After an hour boat ride from Cape Town's V &A Waterfront, there is a guided bus tour around the island and then a guided walking tour throughout the prison. Most of the walking tour guides are former prisoners themselves, and they allow a question and answer session at the end of the tour. If you're traveling to Cape Town during their peak tourism season (December and January), be sure to purchase your tickets a few days in advance as they seem to sell out pretty quickly. Plan on setting aside about 4 hours for the tour to account for the rather slow boat ride to the island and back. Wear good walking shoes and bring a camera; pictures aren't allowed in all parts of the prison but there are some neat photo ops on the bus tour and at the prison entrance. There are Mandela-specific gift shops at the dock at the Waterfront as well as on the island that have a few snacks, drinks, and ice cream, but no substantial food is offered, so don't go hungry!I found that, as an American, it was pretty easy to get wrapped up in the gorgeous scenery and European feel in Cape Town. Robben Island is a humbling reminder of what tourists typically don't see, but should remember as an important part of the country's history."

I can break it down into pros and cons for anyone that might be interested in visiting.Pros:- If you are interested in the political history of South Africa, it is a must see, if only to pay homage to the political prisoners who were there for decades.- There are complimentary tours given by former political prisoners, giving great insight into what life was like on the island.- The island itself (beyond the prison) has a quirky history and has some great views of Cape Town and the coastline.Cons:- Book early and be flexible. We were there in the middle of winter and could only get a tour 5 days away. Book as soon as you arrive in Cape Town or beforehand if possible.- The boat only runs when conditions are perfect. Call ahead on the day of your tour as it may very well be canceled (even if the weather seems perfect). Furthermore, even on a clear day, the ride to and from is very choppy and may lead to see sickness.- For all of its historical value, the prison and grounds have not been \"upgraded\" into a tourist museum. Most everything is about how it was left when the prison was closed. Don't expect elaborate displays or a lot of explanatory exhibits."

I have to say that I joined on this tour with my Irish and American friends dreading another trip marking me as a White person as a \"Bad Evil Person who Hates everyone of colour\" I was amazed that this World Heritage Site and museum, showed a different side, yes the there is a poignant reminder to the newly democratic South Africa of the price paid for freedom but also the history of ALL those who dwelled on the Island against their will.The ferry ride there was very nice and the bus ride itself on the island was remarkable. Our guide was wonderful especially as he gave up his lunch break to take us around as a school group made it hard to find spots on the busses.

Specifics:Tickets: I was luckily warned before I came that buying tickets on-line and several weeks ahead of your visit is essential. Many people have a quick stay in Cape Town and leave bitterly disappointed that they are unable to see the Island. I would strongly suggest buying ahead of time which you can easily do on their website. Nelson Mandela Gateway: You depart on the ferry from here at 3-4 times during the day. The Gateway also houses rotating galleries and a permanent museum on the Aparthied Era that you can browse before/after your tour. Please see other reviews for discussion of weather problems, I was happy that this didn't occur then I was in town.The Island Tour: This is divided into three parts. The first is a tour of the prison itself with a talk from a political prisoner. From here everyone boards a bus and you take a tour of the island and learn a little of the history of Robben Island before and during the Apartheid Era. You are also taken by Robert Sobukwe's encampment, which for me was the highlight of a tour that seemed to be filled with them. The third part of the tour is a quick stop at the storefront where you can buy the requisite momentos.Summary: A visit here should be mandatory if you want to understand the country's past, present, and future. It also shed light on a previosuly unknown figure to me, Robert Sobukwe, who seems to have functioned as \"Malcolm\" to Mandela's \"Martin\" during the trying time of the 1960's.

Our 12 year old son enjoyed it a lot as well.

The trip out to the island is by powerful, diesel powered catamarans which leave from behind the Robben Island Museum at the Victoria and Albert waterfront. The crossing can be quite choppy depending on the weather and swell. If you are up on deck (and you may not have a choice depending on space available within) take something warm and spray-proof for the crossing. The visit to the island is in two parts. Firstly, on arrival, a bus trip, secondly a tour of the prison.The bus trip around the island lasts for about an hour and is extremely interesting, stopping at all points of interest, including the Lime Quarry where political prisoners were expected to work for 6 hours daily. Near the centre of the quarry is a pile of stones which has great significance since the first stone was placed down by Nelson Mandela during a visit with other former prisoners. Since then every former prisoner who visits has added a stone to the pile. It would have been nice to have had the opportunity to get off the bus at this point to photograph it, rather than trying to take photo's through the windows. Forget trying to video as the bus is swaying around a lot on the uneven quarry base.The highlight of the visit is without doubt the tour of the prison.The guides are former political prisoners who give a real insight in to the way of life for prisoners under apartheid. Prisoners including Nelson Mandella were regularly moved from cell to cell during their incarceration, but the cell considered to be Nelson's was the one he occupied during his last few years of imprisonment there.I agree entirely with a previous reviewer - this is not a trip for young children for two reasons. Firstly you need to be of a certain age to understand and appreciate the experience. Young children can become very bored, tired and irritable. The second reason is that once bored, tired and irritable they spoil the trip for those who are trying to pay attention to what is being said. At the end of the trip I felt privileged to have shaken the hand of our guide. I explained to him that I had once served in the Royal Navy and had made four short visits to Cape Town in the mid to late 60's during apartheid, and how embarrased and sorry we all were to have seen the way his people were treated, and that I was so pleased he and brave people like him had got, not only their freedom, but their country which was rightfully theirs.This is a 'must do' during a visit to Cape Town. Everybody does Table Mountain, far fewer make the trip to Robben Island. Be one of them, it's a very memorable and moving experience."

            "review": "I was initially sceptical, but I'm a convert. Before I visited Cape Town my wife mentioned she wanted to visit Robben Island. I was fairly apathetic about this as coming from northern Europe, I had little exposure to South African politics or the struggles of the anti apartheid movement.This is a great place to visit, The tour starts with a boat trip out to the island - it takes about 30-40 minutes. You land on the island and get on an old school bus for an island tour that explains its history pre-Euro-settlement, as a prison and today. You will see where the prisoners were forced to work and live and where the people on the Island live now.The next part - the prison tour is the most interesting part. You will be met by an inmate that was incarcerated in the prison during apartheid. He will explain what life was like and you will be allowed to ask any questions you want. This is genuinely interesting and moving as you can see the emotion as your guide relives his time there.I would recommend this tour for adults and maybe teens, not for youg children though."

My wife and I spent three lovely days in Capetown (about enough) in September, 2005. The half day spent on the Robben Island tour was the highlight. Much more memorable than Table Mountain."

            "review": "Way more than Madiba. This trip is really worthwhile, assuming the weather is OK for the boat trip. The boats depart from near the V&A Waterfront in the centre of Cape Town, and there is a small museum which you can browse after you buy your tickets, while waiting for the boat. It has a lot of hands-on exhibits, and gets you into the frame of mind, so that the boat trip itself becomes part of the overall experienceOnce on the island, there is a coach tour around the main sights, such as the lime quarry, the lighthouse etc. You can only look out the windows of the bus at most of these sights, so if you want to take pictures, try to get a seat beside a window which opens. I think sitting on the left side of the bus is best. You can get out and look around at the lighthouse, but sadly not near the house where Robert Sobukwe was detained. Back in the prison itself, there are guided tours, and you are also free to wander around at this point.The thing that strikes you is that while to non-Africans the island is synonymous with Mandela's incarceration there, it is in fact about far more than that. It has a longer and bloodier history, and this is brought home well during the tour. The tour-guides are mostly former political prisoners themselves, and speak from their own experience. There is a really good bookshop near the jetty where you get the boat back to Cape Town, where you can buy souvenirs, and also a decent selection of books about the struggle. Catering on board is minimal, so bring a bottle of water and perhaps a snack or two, especially if travelling with kids. And take a light raincoat in case of spray on the deck.All in all a moving and worthwhile experience, and a fabulous view of Cape Town across the bay. Highly recommended."
