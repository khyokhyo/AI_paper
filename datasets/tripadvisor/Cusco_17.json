The church is near the Cusco Panoramic Tour bus stop and I had a few minutes waiting time.It looks common on the outside that is why I hesitated for a moment to check it out. But then I was proven wrong when I look into the details. Be mindful though: No photography allowed inside. I was pretty delighted that day to witness the start of the wedding ceremony --- from the moment the bride get out of her vintage wedding car."

The church is interesting as a study of the amalgamation of Spanish Catholicism and native Peruvian belief. I was also fascinated by the paintings of The Cuzco School of artists, native Peruvians who were trained in the European Renaissance style of painting. There's an immense difference in the Quechuan approach to the figure and the classical approach of the Western Europeans. The former is much closer to a Modernist sensibility with its abstraction. The Cuzco School's work shows the incredible adaptation of the Qetchua painters to the Western European approach."

One of the stops was to the Catedral del Cusco. Nothing short of spectacular.!! The outside belies the splendor on the inside. The tour rep mentioned that something like 3 tons of gold is still in the church in various displays and in storage, not to mention all the pure silver as well. Ornate artwork from various metal work, tapestry, paintings and carvings from the 1600's abound (completed in 1654). It is huge inside with perhaps 12 - 15 alcoves, foyers and rooms. It seems to be the little brother of the Basilica in Rome with its sweeping Gothic Renaissance Archways (14 main pillars according to what I read). I enjoyed it."

Take a guided tour through to see the many canvasses and carvings, chapels and statutes and to place these in the context of lives past and those practicing Catholicism today.

The church was filled with tons of statues and artistry. What really made this worthwhile was the audiotour that was included in the entrance fee. It was about 45 min long but really hit on the history, fusion of Andean/Spanish, and artistry. You also have the choice of using a real human guide, which is probably about he same. Kudos to them for giving you the option. The entrance fee was 25 sol per person which was a bit steep, but not bad. Well worth the trip though."

The Cathedral also houses much of Cusco's surviving colonial art which is amazing. The church has 3 separate sections with altars and the main one is all silver, I think because I don't pictures.

Lots and lots of statues (as opposed to say, paintings) in retable niches - almost all clad in elaborately embroidered clothing, The clothing is usually puffed out to resemble mountains - natives considered mountains sacred - so, this mechanism was helpful to convert them. It is said that 25% of the gold looted by Pizzarro enterprises went to these churches, the other 75% to Spain. This is really a complex of 3 churches, and the free audio-guide is quite good. I'd allow about 90 minutes for the visit. No photos allowed, which is a minus. By the way, don't miss the resemblance of Judas to Pizzarro in the last supper painting. Also don't miss the original cross carried around by Vicente Valverde (a priest who accompanied Pizzarro around the country and sold Christianity to the people while Pizzarro looted them) - Valverde went on to become the first bishop in South America. Check out mirrors in the church - usually treated as a sign of vanity, but used here to convert the locals. Finally, don't miss the choir stalls - very elaborately carved cedar wood - and very good."

The reason I gave it four stars was because the price was high compared to other churches/cathedrals we visited in Peru and parts of it were closed for renovations. They offered nothing off the price and asked us to just skip 10 numbers on the tour (of about 30). I was pretty disappointed with that. On a different note you are not allowed to take photos inside, so heads up on that."

The old Catholic churches have a tendency to remind me of the majesty and holiness of God and how finite we humans are, but yet, for most of them, a warm and welcoming refuge from the busyness outside. I find the 3 sanctuaries that I visited (the Cathedral, San Blas and the Convent) did not do that for me. The Cathedral, in particular, while being a huge place, and very ornately decorated, with lots of paintings and gold leaf covered sculptures, seemed to be a mish-mash of styles, and to me, a lower quality of workmanship as compared to the ones in Europe. I find it hard to place my finger on exactly why and what it is, but I came away from this visit uninspired in spirit but intellectually piqued at the contrast between the european cathedrals and this cathedral.Perhaps it is not fair to compare it against their European peers, and perhaps it is this difference that makes the visit interesting, if only to understand the differences across the ocean. At the end of the day, if you are short of time, but still want to drop by to see the churches, I would suggest to pick one - don't think you need to visit both the churches although the ticket gets you into both of them. Btw, there are free audio guides just after the entrance in the Cathedral - just remember to bring your passport as id/collateral (I used my DL instead as I did not bring my passport with me then)."

However, it is unlike any Catholic Church I have ever been in, since the hierarchy has allowed the Inca cultured to be incorporated into the religion, some of which seems contrary to Catholicism overall. However, it IS worth seeing, and don't miss the last supper painting Inca style!"

The murals, the depictions of Jesus in painting, on the wall and hanging on the cross, are just breath-taking. The gold features add to its beauty. However, the best part about the Catedral, appearance put aside, is the feeling I experienced when I entered through its doors. You can see by its details, the love that was put into the making of the Catedral. You can tell by the manner in which they talk about its history that it is well-respected, cherished and loved and you can feel from being in the church a spiritual presence. Just like the Salkantay trek to Machu Picchu, it is a beautiful site, a worthy place to entertain and a humbling experience in its own nature."

It was created in 1559 and it's still standing. It is possible ti visit the place and if you do you will notice a lot of things that do not have anything to do with religion. Things like why it was built that way, the kind of technique they used and many more. It also is right in the Plaza de Armas sector which gives it a particular look. I am not so much into churches and cathedrals but seeing those wonders throughout the countries I have visited makes me think some people had a \u00abvision\u00bb of what could be done.

We just recently made the trip but our itineraries were with others that Viatron; glad we did not use Viatron because this outfit outsources to different travel companies in Peru, and have NO IDEA what those Peruvian companies are doing. Regardless of my experience Cusco is Great, but one must handle high altitude well. Take some local remedies, like coca leaves at the airport, and drink coca tea. It will help. You will need 3 to 4 days to acclimate even when you go first to Sacred Valley. High Altitude sickness will come back upon your return to Cusco. The Catedral is amazing. Somebody knew how to get money to build it. You will not be allowed to take any pictures or movies as there will be swarms of security folks in plain clothes to watch you, so do not do it. There are half a dozen of other churches in Cusco for those with religious interest but no mosques, and no synagogues (at least not on the map). And, pork is a staple food with excellent potatoes and veggies. Beer is local.. This is a old city. The streets are mostly one way and so narrow that a person with large hips can stop the traffic (no kidding, I saw it..lol).The city is full of excellent restaurant but you may need reservations to get it, especial to the ones around Plaza de Armas. Take a trip to Sacsayhuaman. The bird's eye view of Cusco is great. You will survive a stopover at a local sweater from alpaca shop..:0"

There is so much history and artwork in this complex!! Altar pieces of gold and silver, beautiful statues and paintings...VERY worth the ticket price!! The audio tour is like a little iPad so you can replay any site if you want and go at your own pace. It also includes a video as you listen to the commentary which gives you a better closeup of artwork and additional information. My husband and I shared one audio tour and had individual headsets. Beware!! As we entered the cathedral, a tour guide was offering his services -- luckily we realized our ticket included a complimentary audio tour. Very, very interesting.

The audio guide system is also one of the best i have seen in any museum in the world, and really allows you to see all there is to see and then you can still see more on your own, even though they ask to limit the visit to 1.5 hours. Only during this last visit I also learned that the cathedral houses the original cross brought to Peru by the friar accompanying Pizarro during the conquest of Peru. Definitely the history of christianization in Peru is not without questioning and doubtlessly the Spaniards committed horrible crimes in the name of civilization vs. savages, but even as a non-believer, I am most times in awe when visiting the cathedral in Cusco, a feeling only few churches in the world can cause with me."

Definitely recommend- especially if its hot out, its a nice hour break in exchange for a ton of art/cultural information."

First, I had a great guide - Alberto Chara - and he really made the visit worthwhile, especially explaining the artwork. Most of the paintings were created in the 1700's and were supervised by the Spanish but were executed by the local Inca natives. Either on purpose or by accident, there are several paintings with Inca symbols inserted. For example, the large painting of the Last Supper has a guinea pig as the centerpiece on the table in front of Jesus. The guinea pig is a Peruvian delicacy and of course, was not present at the time of the actual Last Supper. Items like that are scattered throughout the cathedral and you'd miss them without a good tour guide or book.The only reason this doesn't receive five stars is they prohibit photography, something the main cathedral in Lima doesn't prohibit."

We actually visited the place a day before with a guide as a part of an organized trip but felt it needed more time. Absolutely wonderful. It is huge, walls covered in great paintings. There is a long room covered in cedar carvings - I think called the music room, fantastic . this is really a special place."

Amazing paintings, statues, carvings and the gold and silver just WOW. Yes this Cathedral like so many here was build on a religious site of the local people but the Spanish destroyed these sites took all the gold and silver an then build these Cathedrals. The entrance ticket for 4 sites is only 30 Soles. Bring a ID to get the electronic guide or your mobile might do."

This church is one of the few cathedrals in South America that clearly demonstrates Spanish construction on religous sites. I have only seen this type of cathedrals in Spain. This church is also a symbol of domination and genocide of the aboriginal people that lived in this community. Some of the staff were rude while we were visiting as they were having loud conversations on the phone and with each other and one person was pointing at one of my friends indicating that my friend was taking pictures of the church (not allowed). I went to the guard and asked them why they were pointing at my friend and they indicated that my friend was taking pictures. My friend had no cell phone or camara, he simply was sitting and looking at the ceiling. I pointed this out to the guard and also told him that instead of making false accusations, he should not have loud conversations on the phone that are disruptive to the visitors."

But it seemed enormous inside, although I think that is because it is compartmentalized into a number of chapels.We were part of a small tour group, and I think it greatly enhanced my appreciation and enjoyment by having a directed tour and more detailed explanations of the structure and the artwork.There are a large number of paintings and I found them all to be beautiful. I understand that they represent the \"Cusco School\" (Escuela Cuzquena), a Roman Catholic artistic tradition and style. Many of the paintings are large murals. Of course, included among the paintings is the famous Last Supper depiction by Marcos Zapata, in which he incorporated several elements of his local people, such as the guinea pig entree and chicha. Our tour guide added an interesting tidbit about Zapata's painting: one of the apostles is clearly meant to be Judas, with a frowning and uncomfortable look on his face, not seen on the other apostles. But Zapata drew the face of this Judas to look like Francisco Pisarro, a likely satirical dig at the conquistador for his supposed \"betrayal\" of the Incan people.I read some of the negative reviews here. Many seem to complain that an admission fee is imposed, whereas they feel that entrance to any church should be free. Well, that's nonsense. Historical churches such as these need to perform a lot of maintenance to keep the artifacts in good condition, so I am not opposed to the charging of admission fees."

Essentially if you have been to any church in Italy/England/Spain you would find the internal contents of this one pale in comparison. I wouldn't recommend visiting it but it's definitely worth viewing the architecture from the front and grabbing that quinessential 'been to cusco' photo (cathedral with plaza de armas fountain in the foreground)."

The room packed with silver is one of my favorites to look at. I have never heard the history of this church, as all 5 times I've been in it, I was working and unable to hear my guides explanation. There is a lot to take in visually. This year I went down into a small room just left of the exit, a catacomb of sorts, but it was a tiny white cemented room with plaques on the walls. Take your time going through, and they do not allow photos."

I enjoy the architecture; the ornate (to the point of being gaudy) representations of religious figures; the high standard of the artisans responsible for converting the riches of a few into incredible carvings, gilded works, paintings, construction techniques, etc., to awe the many.But the outstanding feature of this cathedral for me was the symbology displayed in the painting of the last supper, where a guinea pig is shown as the centre-piece of the meal and Judas is displayed as a person of swarthy features whereas Jesus and the other disciples are white. More astonishing was a figure of Christ as a black-skinned person with Joseph and Mary displayed as whites - this was a temporary display, I think, perhaps associated with a ceremonial day the preceding Sunday. There was more of this incredible symbology; in my experience surpassed only by the amazing Mezquita in C\u00f3rdoba, Spain."

The main course was guinea pig (a common Inca dish) and the other items on the table were food common in the Inca diet.

Inside the cathedral you can see The Last Supper depicted with a Cuy (guinea pig) and other local delicacies gracing the table of Jesus Christ and his disciples.

But taking pictures or videos is strictly prohibited. Even during mass, the prohibitive signs are everywhere which was a letdown for me since I was hoping that I would be able to get pictures when I attended mass. But anyway, the cathedral is composed of three churches. The one of the left riddled with gold and the other on the left, riddled with Silver. The one on the center was a mixture of both. And the Entire Cathedral had small chapels in it too. The difference with this cathedral and the other cathedrals I have visited before was the limited seating it has. I think it is because the choir room is not located in the loft of a church but it is at the ground floor of the church and covers almost half of the area of the cathedral. That being said, it was very interesting to see Church paintings and sculptures made by local painters and sculptures that despite being Christian, also had the \"Inca\" or Cuzco element in it. For instance, the painting of the Last Supper had the Guinea Pig in it and some sculptures of the Blessed Virgin Mary was shaped like a mountain which was (they said) what the Inca's believe represent Nature/ Earth.I hoped that they include a CD with all the pictures inside the Church with the 25 soles entrance in the future just as the Jesuit Church did on the other side of the Plaza (but just for 10 soles).

Listening to the universal oohs and aahs of everyone around me, I sure my opinion is a minority one, and even feel it only fair to rate it as very good. This actually three churches which are adjacent to each other and connected: the church of the Triumph (over the Incas), the Cathedral, and the church of the Sagrada Family. Many, many well-done statues, most dressed on gorgeous gowns. Elaborate baroque altars of silver, a Sala de la Plata (roomful of Silver), lots of gold too. Painting after Huge painting, almost every one by that most prolific of Baroque artists: Anonymous of the Cusco School. A side room full of portraits of princes of the Church, towering wooden carvings, a crypt where the mortal remains of one of the most famous early chroniclers of Inca civilization (the son of a Spanish noble and Inca princess) may lay, or not; all the identified deceased are churchmen, and all died in the 19th century or later. This is conspicuous opulence on steroids, sort of like a Mafia don being driven through Brooklyn in a gold-plated Bentley. Exactly how all this relates to the teachings of the Little Shepherd of the Poor I leave to the theologians.What I do is that while the fabulous CAN also be breath-takingly beautiful (e.g. San Pietro in Rome and Santa Maria Della Fiori in Florence). The Michelangelos and Giottos of the architectural world, alas, had nothing to do with this! It is possible to have buildings which use massive amounts of silver and gold, but are still beautiful: the silver Ordination Hall in Chiang Mai comes to mind. The Golden Pavilion in Kyoto manages to be perfectly beautiful in Zenlike simplicity, despite all that gold. Here, you get conspicuous ostentation to the Nth degree. However, there's something to be said for being a contender for most ostentatious house of worship on Earth, and if you're in Cusco, it's well worth-while wandering in."

A lot of the Catholicism from the Spaniards, you will find, has an Incan spin. This way the Incans did not have to conform to the new religion without relinquishing their own beliefs."

And if its cavernous baroque design doesn't wow you, the Cathedral's opulent ceilings, gold and silver altars, and ornate oil paintings certainly will. The paintings were created by local natives that were trained by the Spanish who tried to repress the native culture which occasionally come through...the local artist's interpretation of the last supper with guinea pig. The Cathedral also houses a world-renowned painting believed to depict the earthquake that shook Cusco in 1650. Between the many, many 'Cusco school' paintings and the melding of Catholic and Andean indigenous influences, this is an absolutely fascinating church to visit......if that is where your interests run."

From the outside, this place looked more like a prison than a church to me (I actually went first to the Iglesia de la compa\u00f1a because it looked more like a cathedral to me from the outside).But inside is a totally different matter. The gothic ceiling in the main sanctuary is impressive. There is gold and silver and paintings everywhere.However, I'm not sure how much I would have appreciated what I was seeing if I had not gotten the audio tour that is included in admission. It was very well done - it directed us around the church with a map that indicated where to stop and look at specific things. I learned a lot about how early church figures used their art to make the Christian story accessible and relevant to the Quechua people in Cusco. It made the whole thing way more interesting than just wandering around and staring at things on my own.Well worth seeing."

There are steps leading to the Church to sit on which gives you a great view of the square.Once inside, there's much gold, art and even a black Jesus (due to all the smoke from the candles) It's huge with many rooms to see but it's redundant. It's decorated with such excess is tasteless."

But either way it's worth a peak.Cusco itself is a very accessible town with lots interesting shops,stops and stays to keep you entertained for some time.

Most Cathedrals around the world which are proud of their art allow photography - especially if they charge for entry. Cusco thinks differently. I wanted to take high quality photos of the interior (without flash) and show them to my friends and family, promoting Cusco to the world and bringing more tourist dollars to Peru. However, whoever made the not very well thought through decision to actively prevent photography is damaging Peruvian tourism. I did not want to pay for the few poor quality postcards of the interior (badly printed) and I would happily pay more money ($$$) to actually be able to photograph the interior with my own camera."

To add to the local colour the painting of the last supper displays a table full of peruvian food including guinea pig , tropical fruits and Judas being given the face of Fransico Pissaro. A comment of our guide to justify how this was allowed to stand was \"this is Peru!\". The conquistadors just had to accept this. The blend of the two cultures works remarquably well.I loved it.

Despite the fact that I've seen enough cathedrals for two lifetimes after traveling through Europe, the Cusco Cathedral is really one of a kind. It's a weird mix of the European catholic culture with the culture of the native South Americans. For example, there is a large painting of the last supper that shows Jesus and the gang feasting on guinea pig. The face of Judas is Francisco Pizarro. Bottom line: even if you've seen a thousand a one cathedrals on your travels, this one is different and shouldn't be missed."

My family and I visited the church as part of a half day Cusco city tour so it was nice to have a guide to point out some of the significant features. I love visiting churches and especially love how over the top many Spanish colonial cathedrals are in South America. This one is actually 3 churches in one with two churches attached on either side of the main basilica apparently due to a rivalry between the Dominicans and Jesuits. It is interesting to see how much of the artwork and carvings were done by native artisans who found subtle and not so subtle ways to include their culture and beliefs. The most notable example is the painting of the Last Supper that shows Jesus and his disciples enjoying cuy (guinea pig) as part of their last meal."

The Cusco Cathedral is an example of a culture superseding another culture (Spanish over the Incan), but with the subtle and resilient story of native Incans grasping to retain a semblance of their own identity and beliefs amidst the conquering (and often destroying) foreigners. Have a native Peruvian - and Incan descendant - help explain how the artwork and designs throughout the cathedral that were \"commissioned\" by the Spanish conquerers contain countless hidden (and sometimes courageously blatant) images of Incan religious and cultural symbols amidst the Christian/Catholic representations. The collections of skulls and bones of ancestors in the subterranean vaults are haunting, and bear witness to a bygone era of ancestral worship."

Though the Catholic religion prevails now throughout Peru, it does make one question at what cost to another culture and people! Definitely a site in Cusco worth visiting and pondering."

It is a vast building packed full of enormous religious works of art, carved altarpieces, and much silver plate and gold leaf paint. The main altar itself consists of over 1200kg of silver - all stolen from the Incas, no doubt, as was the gold in the gold leaf. The sheer scale of this place hammers home the cultural loss arising from all those Inca artefacts melted down for their precious metals. One of the most famous religious paintings in Peru is housed here (although there are versions elsewhere, including in Lima and the village of Chinchero), a rendering of the last supper with a fascinating Quechua spin on it. Jesus and his disciples sit at a table, the centrepiece of which is a roast cuy (guinea pig; despite what the sign claims, it's not a viscacha, definitely a cuy) surrounded by Andean vegetables and bottles of chicha morada. Be aware that those with more delicate sensibilities may find the Andean version of Catholicism to be rather gruesome. There's a lot (really, a lot) more blood in the paintings and iconography than many will be used to. With an entrance fee of S/25 (about \u00a36) this is one of the more expensive tourist attractions in Cusco but well worth it. Note that as with most religious sites in the highlands, no photography is allowed (with or without flash)."

It was fascinating to learn the many ways that the artists modified traditional works to incorporate local flora, fauna and traditions. Take the tour that's included with your ticket!"

Be very careful - you should ONLY be paying for the entrance ticket (10USD for adult, 5USD if you bring an ISIC card). \"Guides\" will try to scam you before you enter to lead you through the inside, but as we discovered, they actually have their own guides inside, leading tours every 10 - 15 minutes or when they have enough people. The negative ratings on this are mainly due to people NOT KNOWING this.No photos allowed inside. But it was a unique church with Peruvian twists. I have been to many churches in Europe, and I still thought this one was quite interesting and worth a visit."

Such as seeing the portrayal of Mary in a rigid pyramidal/triangular shape to symbolize mother earth/mountain is very interesting to see in person. We had a guide with us when we toured and found it to be very helpful and truly brought many of the things we were seeing to life. So much interesting artwork to see.

The Incas originally built their temple here, but when the Spanish conquistadors arrived, they took down the temple and built their Christian cathedral on this site.The cathedral has two altars, the original wooden one at the back and in front of that, an altar of solid-silver. The cedar choir has carved rows of saints, popes and bishops \u2013 all very detailed work. Check out their artwork of the Last Supper (it features a meal of local chinchilla - some say guinea pig - served with an Inca corn beverage).Also visit the \"Black Christ\u201d (a wooden crucifix that turned black from centuries of smoke and dust).Interesting cathedral and worth a visit."

The different Jesus figures rotate to the altar during the year - very interesting. You are not allowed to take photos. We would definitely go back as there is too much to absorb in one or two visits. We highly recommend that you hire a guide- there are plenty near the door. The building was modeled on the cathedral in Pueblo, MX but they ran out of money, so it is smaller. IT IS NOT SMALL. Have not been to Pueblo to compare.

I was under the impression that you could buy a \"religious ticket\" and see several churches for one fee, which is sort of true...the problem is that each ticket offers one local church and a couple on the outskirts of town so there is not way to pay one fee and do a walking tour of the churches that are accessible by foot in town.

It takes up a whopping 4000 square meters, or to put it another way, a whole acre of city real estate, in a mammoth effort to impress the local Indians and covert them, and apparently it seems to have succeeded. At first it was not so impressive as some other cathedrals I\u2019ve been to, until I realized the immensity of the place. It is so huge it would really take at least one day to see it all. In some ways it feels more like a museum than a church, with the constant throng of tourist groups proceeding through the building. There are many larger than life paintings lining the walls, and I can\u2019t remember how many thousand kilos of gold and silver that was stolen from the Incas. Of particular interest is a large painting of Cusco depicting the 16th century earth-quake. Photography inside the cathedral is forbidden, and I managed only a couple of quick shots\u2026 see below.With thousands of tourists piling through the cathedral every day at 25 soles per head, its easy to understand why the emphasis is now on tourism as opposed to running the church service (service only till 10am daily before the tourists arrive). If you are interested in 16th century paintings it is well worth the entry price. However in my book the church at San Pedro de Andahuaylillas on the road to Puno, despite the relatively smaller size was far more impressive."

You understand why Peru and Mexico were the wealthiest of Spain's colonies when you see this. The rather high entry price gets you ihto two adjoining churches and the cathedral. Well worth it for the art and chapels. Odd that independent guides were walking around trying to start a conversation and get a job, made it a bit annoying. Otherwise, we enjoyed as a much better cathedral than many others we have seen. Odd that masses seem to be only at very early hours - I guess that is why this is more of a tourist site than a real cathedral. The Puebla and Mexico City cathedrals are mainly for religious ceremonies, and the tourism comes on the side (and without a fee for tourists.) I take away one star for that - high price to get in and not really a functioning church anymore."

Don't miss the egg-shaped black rock about 3 feet high which represents God to the Inca (\"is God\" according to our guide). On the morning we visited, there were flower petals and small stones that had been dropped on and near the rock by worshippers. It was being moved out of the church about 40 years ago during a remodeling but local opposition prevented that and it was kept in a back corner. The church is much larger than it first appears and is certainly worth a visit. It bothered me that we may have been interfering with worship, though we were trying to be quiet and no photos are permitted."

As other reviewers point out, there are numerous \"churches\" within the naves and apses of the cathedral. Having learned a bit of history during my visit to Peru, I knew that this cathedral was built on top of a large, important Incan temple as part of the Spanish program to \"civilize\" the natives (they built churches on top of every Incan temple that they found to send the message that their god was more powerful than the Incan gods). That knowledge along with the fact that Spain (and the Catholic church) enslaved the native people and took their gold and silver to build this cathedral as well as many others put a damper on my enthusiasm for what would otherwise be an impressive monument. I did enjoy the Cusco school of art work, done by natives trained to imitate European religious art - the most famous of which is the last supper, featuring a Peruvian delicacy, guinea hen. It is worth the price of admission just to see this one painting."

Interesting enough, one of these paintings, depicting a \"Last Supper\" (Leonardo da Vinci would have loved to see this version of his famed one) understandably had tropical fruits and a roasted \"cuy\" (guinea-pig) as entries on the center platters...However, what bothered me the most was the impudence with which the Spaniards (and their Church, as a matter of fact) indulged in flaunting lavishly decorated glittering altars of gold and silver (the very reason they had come and conquered) in the face of the enslaved indigenous peoples who had managed to somehow survive the ordeal and the cruelties inflicted upon them. Even all the precious hard-wood ripped from the forests and employed to further decorate everything else, and the stones taken by dismantling the existing Inca religious buildings to build their own, leaves you wonder if you truly like it or not!As an Italian baptized in the Catholic Church, and having had in my upbringing to painfully digest its historic immoral (and at times) brutal duality, I have a hard time accepting as \"beautiful\" the altars of gold, built by rivers of blood!"

Among the buildings surrounding the square are the Cusco Cathedral (Catholic), and the Church of the Society of Jesus (Jesuit). Photography is prohibited inside the catedral. However, an interesting item inside the cathedral is a painting by Marcos Zapata of the Last Supper where a roasted guinea pig (cuy) is in front of the image of Jesus and other dishes typical of Peruvian food. Guinea pigs are a favorite delicacy in Peru.In the main altar covered with silver plates is an image of the Assumption Madonna to which the cathedral is dedicated to. There are two smaller churches adjoining the Cathedral: the Church of Triumph and the Churce of the Holy Family. Rivaling the Cathedral is the Jesuit Church of the Holy Spirit. These churches and places of worship are worth a visit when one is in Cusco."

All the religious floats from the various parishes around were being paraded around the cathedral and then taken inside.The main thing inside that we really wanted to see was a very famous picture of The Last Supper. This is notable because the Supper is a feast of roast guinea pigs, a Peruvian delicacy, and the depiction of Judas as the Spanish conqueror, Francisco Pissaro!We were told that if we got to the Cathedral at 6 am, before our flight to Ecuador, we would be able to visit the Cathedral.It eventually opened around 6:15 am and we got to see the painting. It was worth the effort on its own. No doubt the architecture is interesting inside and there are other items to see, but we still had a plane to catch. We just had time to see all the religious floats from the procession the previous day at close quarters and in peace and quiet. There is a no photography rule in the Cathedral. Even though there was no one around to stop us, we played by the rules.So don't miss the Last Supper and go and see the other aspects of the Cathedral that we were in too much of a rush to see.Worth getting up at 6 am for and missing breakfast."

If you want a guide, there are touts(?) by the entrance, offering their services for a further S25. Inside, the Cusco Cathedral is like many other catholic cathedrals that you'll see. Paintings on every available wall space, altars decorated with vast amounts of gold, silver or mirrors. The side chapels are quite nice, as is the wooden choir area and the Cuscuenian \"Last Supper\" painting.I'd say it's worth visiting if it's part of an organised city tour, where you have a guide and several stop. Just not sure it's worth your S25 for a dedicated visit. If you're only going to visit one religious building in a Peru city, make sure you see San Fansisco church in Lima. Entry to the church is free and the 7 sol tour is fantastic!"

After the invasion along with the Spaniards who helped a lot both tried to destroyed as much as they could for the benefit of God and their believes. All of what they have seen was consider evil and profane. The Inka buildings fell in this category. After seeing how they were made, big stones cover with gold etc. they truly thought they were places of Satan. For them there wasn't any explanation how humans could have build such things... Forced labor was imposed onto the survivors and the stones of previous palaces, temples, houses of learning and prayers were used to build not only the Cathedral but many other churches. It was said that Cusco had more churches per capita then houses... Each stone carries the sweat of the defeated... some of them without eating or resting being forced to chew on coca leaves and drink the famous Spanish \"aguardiente\" The Spaniards found very quick the effects of the Coca leaves will do and of course they used to their advantage! The Cathedral in Cusco is the pride and joy of the Catholic Church as much it's now for all the Catholics in Cusco. It houses a lot history. There stood Inka Viracocha's palace.It started to be built in 1617 finished on 1668. It gathers various styles Gothic, Mannerist, Renaissance & Baroque fortify with two lateral towers on each side, the front portals are Mannerist style and the center is directly Baroque. It's altars are Renaissance style, Baroque and Neo'Clasic. They're the result of the incredible skill of indigenous Cusco artisans carved in solid wood cover with \"24K gold (\"Pan de oro\") the same goes for all the frames and paintings done by also indigenous artists. It's amazing to think when you admire these works of art done by the survivors of the Inka invasion, the finery of their work resembles the finery of the works done in times of the Inkas, well done and perfect. These are the people whom they were called savages and ignorant. The cathedral still carries withing in it's walls a lot of drama and mystery. It's dark, the lighting is a bit poor. There is a little detail not to miss, closed to the entrance double doors there is a stone called by the locals THE FORGVINESS STONE is a piece of stone of the Waca that Inkas kept in the middle of the Plaza. Now when the festivities of Corpus Christy are being celebrated each patron Saint vows to it three times when they leave the Cathedral for the usual walk around the perimeter of the Hacaypata. They do the same when they leave after the celebrations to their own Parochial churches.The Corpus Christy is a christian celebration masking an old Inka festivity where just as much as now as the saints parade around the Plaza, in their time the Inkas took for parade their most precious Mommies all dressed in their most fancy garbs and jewels. It is curious now how the parochial saintsl compete against each other for whom is the best dressed of adorned!! If you get to see the \"stone of forginess\" vow to it and ask the blessings of the spirits of the Inkas... No shame on doing that!!"

Our guide was very friendly but he was under a timeline and we had to skip certain parts cause he was in a rush. Thirdly don't expect any of them to have any real knowledge of the artwork. At one point he said a painting was of water paint when it was obviously a oil painting. I would recommend bringing you own tour book in with you and taking your time.

Church music is about the same story as at other churches I've visited in Mexico, one organist services multiple churches in a town, if they have an organ at all, and if they do, usually most of the pipes are long gone, and they're actually using a 1980's electronic organ. Sunday Mass was in the Cusque\u00f1an language -- new for me -- but the homily in Spanish.

I went to mass here one morning. The cathedral is awesome, full of treasures and wonderful art from the Conquistador period."

The first thing I notice upon entering is the interior is painted (poorly) to look like marble. The Spanish invaders stole natural finished native stones from Incan holy sites, then painted them like marble to mimic the beautiful cathedrals in Rome.The other features of the cathedral are primarily silver and gold encrusted alters (also stolen from Inca sites), and freakishly vibrant statues of Jesus in various states of torture, Mary, and saints. The gold and silver seem to be a display of wealth and power - it lacks an artists touch. There are many paintings, mostly poorly lit and difficult to see.The one gem is the choir area - an enclosure in the middle of the third room, it's made almost entirely from intricately carved cedar. Amazingly detailed and artistic woodwork, and one of the few features that was truly inspiring."

Cathedral has four prominent main altars with very elaborate work. It greatly reminded me of the Cathedrals in Barcelona and Toledo. There are crypts under the main altar. Recommend you view the Last Supper Mural or painting behind the main altar with the guinea pig as the main meal and the Chicha (Purple Corn Drink) on the table. Tour guide told us that Judas is dressed like Pizzaro who as we know was the Spanish conqueror of the Incas. A must visit while in Cusco, preferably with a tour guide."

We didn't get the audio tour nor did we have a tour guide, but the few overheard quips from other tour guides made it seem that such would have been desirable. However, it was fairly easy to just try to absorb all the art and gold leaf without the guides. My husband and I tested our Spanish and Latin by playfully attempting to decipher the captions. Overall, the visit to the Cathedral was a pleasant way to spend the afternoon inside the shelter of a church. I would recommend burning a couple of hours leisurely there."

We wanted to visit the beautiful convent located right next door to the cathedral but that was a whole other package for sale. The Cusco tourism board would rather rip off tourists than make things convenient for visitors that keep the economy afloat. Also, there are no photos allowed anywhere in the cathedral, but apparently they allow large and extremely loud tour guides who shout throughout the cathedral. Again, they prefer the admission prices rather than let visitors take harmless photos and video without a flash. You would be much better off not going inside the cathedral and just take photos outside and spend your money elsewhere. The cathedral was a huge letdown."

Observing the various saints, different aspects of the Virgin, and even differing versions of Jesus... it is difficult to see how this account of Catholicism is any different than Hinduism, with its varying aspects of their deities. It's like a Wal-Mart of gods! I would have given the Cathedral five stars, but I had to hold one back because I kept thinking about how, in some sense, this place was the historical celebration of the ruthless destruction of a civilization and people whom the Spanish did not care to understand. And I'm not really buying the propaganda that the native descendants today are monotheists - they just adapted their beliefs enough to stop the slaughter. Oh well, it's still a great place to experience, to think, to philosophize... and then to go out and get a good pizza!"

We took a tour of Cuzco via the travel company Llama Path and our tour guide brought us here and showed us the highlights. I would recommend the Cuzco city tour though them as a must-do. It Includes Sacsayhuaman as well, which is also must see."

            "review": "Unique among the many.. We visited maybe 6-8 churches during our time in Peru (Lima + Cusco + countryside) and to be honest they all began to look the same after a while. This one is a bit different. Located on the northeastern side of the main square, admission (again no pictures allowed) was separate from the Boleto Turistico ticket we used for most of our time in Cusco. The complex is just that: a central cathedral joined with two separate chapels (Iglesia del Triunfo and Iglesia de Jesus Maria) that together form an immense repository of decorative religious art and paintings. We toured the area with a local private guide for approximately an hour. Highlights included the oldest surviving painting Cusco and of course the famous \u201cLast Supper\u201d painting with the indigenous touches of guinea pig and chi-cha beer on the table. There are seemingly infinite side chapels, each with its own story and one even commemorating Pope John Paul\u2019s visit in 1985.My sense after visiting here is that we barely scratched the surface of what the cathedral has to offer. Our guide spent 20 minutes on one painting alone reviewing the symbolism and interplay of Spanish and Inca viewpoints. If Lima is the political capitol of Peru then Cusco is the spiritual one; a visit here should be near the top of any itinerary when visiting the city and with the possible exception of Qorikancha is the most representative of the area\u2019s history."

Make sure you ask about the free audio guide- they dont promote this service, hoping instead to con you into paying for a guide. The building- 3 separate churches in one, has enough \"stuff\" to keep one occupied for 1 to 2 hours if viewing at a reasonable pace. For those complaining about parts being original- hard to expect that when earthquakes are knocking stuff down every 50 years or so. Sadly, no cameras allowed- even the light from autofocus settings in subdued light can deteriorate old paintings."

The tour is obviously more informative as you see the entire facility with its many chapels, fresco paintings, gold overlay, intricate wood carvings and images of every saint known to man. Knowing that this shrine was built on top of the most sacred temple of the Inca people should conjure up some mixed emotion (not all of which is pride)but never the less, now this spot is not just another Catholic Cathedral, it is essentially the Vatican of South America, the religious epicenter. Again, for a variety of reasons, it is a must see."

Oh, yes, Jesus is also there, off to one side on a cross opposite the ambo. The churches on either side are unremarkable --- why attach two churches to a cathedral? Personally, I found the \"original\" reredos, now hidden by the pean to Mary on the high altar, more interesting -- just walk around back of the high altar. Blessedly, the high altar is of plain stone, stark amid the grandeur around it."

The choir (woodwork) was especially mindblowing. I believe this place is as breathtaking as it is because of the confluence of various cultures which shows in the paintings and everywhere. An audio tour was great. We could pause, or go ahead at a pace we felt comfortable at . Some of the guides were running around trying to wrap it up real fast. If you feel sick during the visit there , they have medical services , oxygen tank, cocca tea at the end near the exit. Do allocate more than a few hours. This is a place to be seen at leisure and not hurried thru!"

Once inside, an attendant asked if we wanted an audio guide-even though there were no signs saying that one was available when buying the ticket. The audio guide is free and is probably the best, most professionally produced, audio guide I have ever listened to in any similar place, anywhere in the world. The cathedral is lovely, and the guide puts it into context with Peru's history and culture. Even if you do not normally like going to churches etc go to this one."

There are huge altars with lavish gold decoration, and the paintings in particular are quite interesting.Your tour guide (do bring one for the best experience) will tell you about how in the beginning the newly formed Peruvian Catholic Church artists copied the Spanish versions because they didn't know how European people looked and behaved. You can see that in some cases the copies are good, others they are not very good, which is interesting in itself. Later, as they realized that it was going to be easier to convert the local people to Catholicism if they made it something they could relate to, they gave the artists more leeway and you can see the result - for example, a Guinea Pig on the table at the Last Supper. You can also see a copy of the famous \"Black Christ\" statue - this is not the original one, it's a copy, our guide told us. Supposedly it got black from soot, but this clearly was not the case regarding this statue, you can tell that by looking at it. There are catacombs you can explore, many beautiful altars, it's quite an interesting church to see, and it's huge!"

Entrance fee includes a self-guided audio tour in the language of your choice which is very well done. It definitely makes the experience knowing some of the history of the building and the art.

Incredible art done on paintings and sculptures.Several fascinating things we spotted inside:\"Black Christ\". According to Wikipedia this is a crucifix that has turned black over the years due to smoke and dirt, but that's not what it looked like to me. The sign in front seems to indicate that it represents either an Incan god or somebody from the area that lived in the 16th century.At the exit from the main cathedral to the adjacent church (I think it's El Triunfo, the one to the right of the altar), there's a painting that appeared to us to depict the life and death of Socrates. Maybe we misinterpreted it.And right after entering El Triunfo, there's a statue of a man who appears to be dressed like a pirate riding a horse. There's no sign explaining this status so I haven't a clue as to what it's supposed to be.And of course there's the famous painting of the Last Supper which shows Jesus and the Apostles dining on some sort of Andean animal (I think the sign says it's not cuy but it kind of looks like it).All in all a worthwhile trip. It was one of the few main tourist sites available on a rainy Sunday afternoon. The S/.25 does seem a bit steep as the entire 3-church complex isn't really that big."

The tour focuses on the most interesting aspects of the cathedral, such as the blending of the indigenous and Catholic beliefs as well as specifics about the Cusco school of painting (the Last Supper with the cuy is here) and things that occurred at the church. The price is a little steeper than at some of the other sites because it actually allows entrance to other local churches for the same price, which we didn't use or need, but given the thoroughness of the tour here it was still a bargain."

Most of it is very standard and pretty Catholic church stuff, but a few things are very interesting with regard to the mixture of Inca beliefs and the psychological warfare used to convert them. Be sure to notice the guinea pig on the last supper plate, the pachumama on chair arms, and the painting of a Saint destroying the Arabs. Be sure to ask for an English-speaking guide that is included in the admission fee. They do not offer it so you could miss out otherwise.
