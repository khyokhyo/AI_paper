            "review": "Felt like I went to a club instead of SPA. We went there one night for SPA, both of us had the 2 hours treatment (oil massage, body scrub and moisturising), we started at 9pm but the therapists seems a bit unhappy when we requested for toilet and a quick shower first (as e've been walking all day outdoor), the therapists told us that the water supply got some issue so there was only cold water, so we had a quick and cold shower.The massage technique was okay, the sequence is a bit weird though, normally it should be body scrub followed by oil massage, but we had the other way round. The massage oil and body scrub were not warmed up, so it didn't feel quite pleasant when they put those on your skin.The soundproof is HORRIBLE, not sure if it was only our room, but the SPA is situated right at the pub street corner, we heard loud music throughout the 2 hours treatment, it was impossible to relax really.Would not recommend going there at night unless you wanna look for a quick fix."

I was in town for four nights with my husband and a few friends and we went for massages every single day we were in town. The prices may be a little pricier than spas right off the street, but if you are looking for the spa ambiance and a team that is professional and uses great products, this is where you need to go. For Western standards, the prices are still more than reasonable. My review is specifically for the various massages they offer, from the Balinese to the neck shoulders and back. We had different masseuses every time we went, but all of them were friendly and thorough throughout the the entire experience. Their english is limited but they are mindful of asking how you like your massage. The massage rooms are also peaceful and clean. For a little slice of heaven in Siem Reap, go to Bodia Spa for a massage.I'm glad we overindulged while we were there. It's well worth it."

Best decision ever!I got the 2 hour jasmine rice relaxation package.First off I knew this place would be great, because there were so many people waiting for a massage even in the low season.Started with a 15 minute foot and leg wash with lemon. Then has a 75 minute massage with my choice of oil. My masseuse Chea Map was clearly a master at her craft, and she followed all my requests regarding intensity and areas to focus on.Then I had a rice scrub that was the best skim treatment I have ever had. The difference between this and all of places in town is their skin care products as they are all organic and made I'm house.Then I showered in the in room shower, which was fully stocked with all of their products for me to sample. My favorite was their price and aloe shampoo.After that I had a 15 minute full body hydration with their amazing lotion. This specific treatment is highly recommended to all, but especially people like myself who have multiple skim allergies. Can't say enough about how much I loved this place. Will try to come back before my flight tomorrow.- Written on behalf of my wife"

She then left the room and returned for what could only be described as a pathetic massage. I specifically asked for \"strong\" and very little oil. The menu says you can choose your scent, no offer and when I asked for lemon grass, I received something like coconut. Three times I asked for strong, no success. She had no technique other than rub up and down. I had so much oil on me at the end of the massage I asked to have a shower...\"up to you\" was the answer. There was a shower in the treatment room, with shower gel but no towels. I used the one from the massage.We asked to speak to a manager, no on know if one was there. It was expensive by Siem Reap standards, $44 USD. Would not recommend this place."

We went in with my inlaws and husband, we love that they are open from 10am to midnight, they have many masseuses so you don't have to wait if you didn't manage to get a reservation before hand, the place is beautiful and a oasis in the streets of Siem reap, they have a lovely store for salts and oils, the only thing I would advice is that you have to go up some stairs so if you can't manage stairs I don't know if they have rooms in the lower level, I had a 1:30 massage and left the place extremely relaxed, you can shower in the room if you like, they have single and couples rooms, they asked about which oil would you like, if men o woman, and which type of room, we came because a friend recommended the place and it was as good as he described"

I visited this spa with a friend who is used to having massages, unlike me.IThe spa itself was fine, the place, the warm towel, drinks and foot wash were lovely. That's where my good experience ended. After that, I wish I had never gone there : I will just describe my experience of the 4-hand massage for 90 minutes. The 2 girls unfortunately did not know anything about the techniques of massage as they only used the same movements (from bottom to top) which was quite boring, especially for the back part that seemed to last for ages (at least 40 minutes). But, that would just be fine if I had not suffered from the strength used by the girls : when I said it was \"too strong\", they carried on with very strong massages at the bottom of my back and it was so painful, just like being hit by somebody. I became very tensed and said again that it was too strong. The girl realized that she had got it wrong in the first place (probably just understood the word 'strong') and said sorry and they both carried on with a milder pressure. Unfortunately, it was too late and the following day, I had 2 huge bruises at the top of my buttocks. The following day, I went there again to show my bruises to a manager. The woman just thanked me for letting her know about that, did not even apologize and told me to leave my email, which I did. This was 2 weeks ago and I have not heard of anybody since ! My friends had a slightly better experience as she asked for a milder massage from the beginning, but she definitely thought that the 2 girls she had were not qualified for this job. The price was 55 $, this is why I would not recommend it at all, even if it was cheaper !Hope this experience will help you to decide..."

If you are wishing to take care of yourself don't think twice, this is the place to be!More expensive of the hundred of spa and massage in Siam Reap town but every dollar is well spent. However still 70% less then a similar spa in Rome or Milan...The spa is really cool with excellent service.I tried the traditional massage with aromatherapy and it was a great experience. Courtesy together with professional and well trained personnel make you feel home. Oil used for massage is combined with pure natural essence, both of first quality (you could buy these products at the shop). I will do it again before to leave Cambodia.They also do child massage and my daughter 8ys old get a Balinese massage + aromatherapy and she was so happy."

I decided to go with the head, shoulder and back massage for a full hour. After I choose my treatment I was asked to fill out a form that asked about several medical conditions, that could be probably be worsened by a massage. Very professional.Then I got to choose which massage oil I wanted and was taken upstairs to a private massage room, where you can take a hot shower before you start the massage, very comfortable. After that the massage started and it was sooo amazing, I felt all relaxed afterwards. During the massage the lady asked a few times if the pressure was ok and if I was comfortable (which I was every time). A really great spa."

Well it all started when we booked online and told them our hotel for a pick up and waited on the appointed date and time. Nothing. Nobody arrived and when our hotel called them they made some strange excuse about their email being down (don't they have another system for reservations?). Nevertheless a tuk tuk driver was despatched and we got there and waited for them to prepare a room because somehow they lost our booking. We booked in for the Relaxation package-3 hours with a massage, scrub and facial. My husband and I were in a couples room and we were led upstairs by two therapists. They barely looked at us and were robotic but we just figured they were a bit shy. No big deal although it has to be noted that many of the therapists seem almost down or something. For eg. they hand you an empty basket to put your shoes in and don't even look at you or say anything.The massage was good-not really a sports massage, rather more lots of oil but we both fell asleep. The scrub was fine and then came the facial. Oh I should also mention that there are big gaps of abut 5-10 minutes at times when they just leave or start cleaning up around you. That is not good in my opinion as you pay for 3 hours of therapy. My therapist was very strange. During one of these 10 minute breaks I looked down and she was sitting on the floor gazing up at the other therapist who was doing the facial on my husband. I guess she had been doing that for a while. When I looked she got up and went back to me but it felt really odd and she did this a few times. I'd say that at least 50 minutes out of the 3 hours wasn't actually with the therapist working on you. They'd sit behind you (while the facial mask was infusing for 20 minutes) instead of massaging arms or doing a head massage which is the usual custom. Or they'd just sit and watch the other one. This was a confusing and very below average spa experience. Would not recommend this spa at all."

However, when I opened my eyes during the head massage I could see the lady pointing at my head and telling the lady giving my husband a massage to look. This made me feel really uncomfortable.

It seemed like a very long time that I lay there with some mango mask on my face, at least 20 mins. I was just left there, then the door burst open the bright lights turned on and someone barged into the treatment room! I sat up clutching the towel around my chest, removed whatever cucumber situation was on my eyes and I think saw a child inside the room! Then I saw my therapist sitting on the floor behind the other empty treatment bed! It was all very bizarre and I just wanted to leave at that point.

And a slightly fragrant moisturizing rub down. Did I say heavenly bliss?!??! The treatment began and ended with a lotus flower and lemongrass tea, a bow, and a smile. It was all I could have asked for and more. The facilities are beautiful and serene and the staff were very sweet. A must do in you have the time!

I was traveling last week with 3 other girlfriends and we pre-booked appointments at Bodia Spa after reading many great reviews and also receiving a recommendation from a work colleague who had been there during the Christmas holidays. We each booked a package that included a foot wash, massage, scrub or wrap, and a facial. The spa itself was fine, and the warm towel and tea were lovely. That's where my good experience ended. After my 5 min foot wash i went into the treatment room for my massage. Well, i wouldn't exactly call it a massage as much as an oil rub down. The girl I had unfortunately did not know anything about actual massage and didn't have any strength past very mild pressure. What really makes me write this negative review is that throughout my entire massage, the girl would stop mid rub to pick something out of the oil that she was rubbing on me and wipe it off on the bed towel. I figured it was probably a piece of my hair at first so not big deal. Well this continued about ever 2-5 minutes while she was massaging my arms and legs as well. I tried to stop her cuz I was thoroughly disgusted; I could only think she was picking hairs off of me that came from the unclean towel covering my entire body. She didn't understand and I didn't want to disrupt the massage of my friend in the same room (yes we were put two in a room because that's all they had available) so I continued the massage/rub and kept pulling the towel off of my arms and legs. I should have just walked out but stayed hoping the rest of my treatment would be better. The same girl did my scrub and facial. Scrub was fine - not too much you can do wrong there but the facial was again disappointing. Apply some oil, wipe it off, apply some lotion, wipe it off, mask next, etc. Unfortunately again no facial massage just some light tapping. Not what i would call a facial. My friends had a better experience than i did and said their massages were good. I would not recommend this spa based on the cleanliness and in-experienced staff. Oh, one more item to be aware of, this location is right off of Pub Street so if you want to relax, do not go at night like we did. The music from the bars is super loud in all the treatment rooms."

During the past 2 weeks I have been going for budget massages etc in Siem Reap and have been pleasantly surprised how good they have been but today I thought that I would try the more upmarket Bodir Spa and found it to be a first class experience. They have created a very pleasant environment and the whole place has a beautiful and relaxing feel about it . I found everything to be very professional and I was pleased with the service. It's a highly recommendable spa ."

Really nice atmosphere, great service ( I usually like strong pressure for my massages and each time they could accommodate), and very reasonable compared to the other higher end spas. I got a massage, foot massage, facial and 3 hour relaxation package which had a massage, body scrub, wrap, and facial. What a treat! Plus, if you book ahead of time, they will send a tuk tuk to get you!"

Massage was so bad and asked to change and was told it's like that. She even said foot massage is like that. It's a terrible experience coupled with food massage done on a massage bed. Horrendous!

My husband and I visited a few spas during our 8 days stay and that was by far the best.The facilities are very elegant, clean and professional. The spa sent a tuk tuk to pick up my husband and I and as we arrived, we were offered some cold drinks.We were then taken into our 'couples room' where oils and preferences of treatments were discussed.The thing I appreciated the most was that they set the air con to our liking. It sounds simple but that was something wrong ever time in other spas. Either too cold or too hot, the right temperature made such a difference!I asked for a very soft massage, as I was hurt in another spa and the massage was so well done that I fall asleep and it never happens to me! We then had a mango wrap done followed by a facial. The 3 hours went really fast and we came out really relaxed.The spa was certainly slightly more expensive than the top 1 and 2 of TripAdvisor but it was worth paying more!Highly recommended if you like peaceful, professional treatments!"

Once you have chosen your massage you also choose the scent of oil and fill in a short questionnaire about your medical needs and any specific areas you want focussed on.

We were all very happy with our treatments.Note that the spa didn't seem to have facilities such as a steam room, etc. There are also no common locker/changing rooms. The treatment rooms had individual showers and a box to store your belongings. In late November, there was no sign of mosquitos anywhere around the spa.

She gave me a hard time about this when she came in but I nipped the discussion in the butt. She then asked me if I wanted strong or medium and then questioned my choice of strong wondering if 'you can take it'. Then she kept asking me every two minutes if I was ok until I told her to stop it. Then there were Mosquitos in the room which was weird, the list was endless.

I've been to numerous spas in Southeast Asia region and I can say its the worse ive had it.Why its bad:1.) On our way to the treatment room upstairs, I realised the corridors are exposed to the outdoors through holes on the wall. This creates openings for mozzies to come into the treatment room, as we subsequently found out.2.) After we were inside, the towels we were provided, and the towels laid out on the treatment bench, were not completely dry but slightly damp. Not only does this create hygiene concerns, but imagine your head lying inside the treatment bench headrest with a funky smell that the unclean towels gave off.3.) Poor attitude of the staff.My gf proceeded to lie on the treatment bench, and the masseuse proceed to tie up her hair. My gf gave a shout because she yanked her hair, and she gave a \"i dont give a shxx\" look and just shrugged in response.When they were massaging my gf's fingers, normally they would pull and pop each and every finger. Well the masseuse couldnt be bothered and only pulled/popped 7 fingers.4.)And the worst part:A mosquito managed to make its way into the treatment room from the previously mentioned openings. I ended up with 3 mozzie bites over the session, and with 2 before the massage even started. Imagine yourself as a sacrificial sitting duck on the altar for the mosquito god whilst you are trying to relax. Pretty hard eh?After 10 mins into my massage, I had to stop my masseuse and gesture for something to address this, albeit with much difficulty, to which the masseuse disappeared and returned 10 mins later with tiger balm for the bites and a lemongrass like mozzie spray (all on my clock of course).Hence I got alot less than an hour.I didnt feel as scammed as I would have, since I booked this session as a package with Champey cooking class for USD 45 (which, was fantastic and gets full marks from me). If I had booked Bodia as a standalone item, I totally don't think it's worth it at all, with the indifference of the staff to our experience, and the hygiene issues.Nevertheless, I just got another aromatherapy massage done today at my hotel (Lynnaya Urban River Resort), and although its a few bucks more, its actually clean and just left me feeling totally relaxed."

It's one of the more upmarket spas, but it's definitely worth it.My masseuse was very good, checking about pressure and taking her time to do everything properly. I prefer medium touch, and she got it just right, I even dozed off a couple of times.If you're doing a scrub like I was, you need to get totally naked, but they are good with the towel placement if you feel uncomfortable about that kind of thing :) Just a note, it personally didn't bother me, but she did stay in the room changing the dirty sheets from the scrub and mud, so when you're in the shower she is there - but she's busy doing stuff, so they're very polite and give you space, but you don't get much privacy as a heads up.The facial was quite good, lovely gentle products. A bonus was having her do my underarms, not super relaxing having them tweezed, but a nice bonus none the less! A tip: the package deals are the best value, the Relaxation package in particular is 3hrs for a massage, facial, full body scrub and lotion, and considering what you pay for a massage alone here, it's worth getting a package, you won't regret it."

Unlike others who reviewed their services, I was not inspired by, or did I think my massage was brilliant or even great; it was, however, a cooling and relaxing experience, and a great escape from the heat of Old Market Siem Reap on Saturday, August 1. As advertised, it is on the second floor just above a Pharma Care; though, the entrance is in the alley right beside it. Signage is great, and it is easy to find. It's a beautiful foyer/welcome area with a grand, sweeping staircase in the center, to the right of check-in. I was a walk-in client, so perhaps that's why my experience wasn't as stellar as others who have written reviews here. I was ushered in at approximately 11:15, and taken to the foot massage area. I had asked for a 90-minute foot massage (which they called Shiatsu), and brought in a 15% off coupon which they honored.The entire spa was still and empty; no one else was being tended to behind the curtained areas, which I thought strange for a Saturday. My therapist was a little less than confident or even competent. She did massage my feet, but it wasn't shiatsu. She did some acupressure work, but she was clearly not as skilled or experienced as other massage therapists whom I had had in Asia (particularly China, who really train their therapists well, in my experience).Having said that, it still felt good; it was still a relaxing experience, and provided much needed pedal relief for my sore feet post Wat-ing in Angkor the previous three days. After the service, I was brought back to the foyer area, given a cup of hot tea and a cold towel while I put on my shoes. I checked to make sure that they had given me the 15% off for the ninety minute massage (normally $33, with the discount roughly $28). Everything was correct, so I paid. It wasn't until after I left that I looked at the time, and noticed just over an hour had elapsed since my service began, and that I hadn't been given the full ninety-minute massage. I didn't go back to complain, primarily because I didn't want to muster that part of the brain to complain, and ruffle my state of mind which had been brought to a wonderful peace and cool in their inner sanctum."

Told him about my problems as I had pains at certain areas, he recommended me which type of massage too! You will need to fill up a form to list if you have any pre-existing conditions and also to indicate which areas you would like the masseur to focus on. Was brought up to level 2, where the masseur helped washed my feet (which I do not see in practice elsewhere in SR) and was brought into a cocoon shaped room (very interesting design) where there's showers available too.The place was quiet and they played natural sounds (e.g. birds chirping, rain, etc...) which was quite unique.Will strongly recommend a visit for those who do not mind spending a little more to pamper yourself.Went there at around 10pm."

The massages are generally really good. The masseurs know how to make you feel better. You need a stronger hand? ask for it. You want the scrub to be smoother?

The body scrub was a new experience for me- they really scrub almost everything :) the woman stayed in the room while I showered, I would have preferred a little more privacy but at that point she had seen it all so it wasn't a big deal. The facial was mainly just a cleansing with an exfoliating scrub and then a mask left on for about 30 min. I fell asleep, so it was definitely relaxing, but probably not worth $20. Overall, I'd recommend it for massage- a huge step above the other parlor around town and worth the more expensive prices."

We spent a very enjoyable 3 hours having a 'relaxation package' which consisted of a feet cleaning, deep tissue massage, a body scrub and a facial for $65 per person. A new experience for me and an excellent way of preparing for our 13 hour flight back to the uk. Facilities were very clean, lovely staff, not for the prudish maybe but we both thought it was lovely."

It has been my tradition that every time i travel the finale of my trip will be a spa treatment and so i went online and check which spa is the best in Siem Reap and read about Bodia Spa. Tried their Balinese Full Body Massage. While waiting, they served a cold beverage which i believe locally made with a cold towel.. Good start. :) then they asked me to wait like 5 minutes or so then they introduced me to my spa therapist.. treatment room is good,smells good and music is soothing..I almost doze off while having the massage..hihi.. It was really nice.. Price is above average but worth it. I highly recommend you try this spa if you happened to visit Siem Reap. :) :)"

Having visited Siem Reap in November 2014 I came across Bodia Spa and cannot speak highly enough of the staff and centre. I can honestly say that this is the only spa that I have fallen asleep at and woken myself up snoring, that is how relaxing and professional this place is. If you are ever in Siem Reap, do yourself a favour, don't miss out on this gem."

It ruined my whole treatments as I couldn't bear it and was simply concentrating on it, instead of the spa. Will not try it out again. Sorry."

The continual disappearance of said massures during the 90 minutes also equally annoying. I do have to admit my first reaction once over was to check bags for money etc. All Ok, except for the fact that the massage was done with the least amount of skill or care. Keep looking if you ask me."

Ladies almost did not talk to each other, just occasionally whispered to each other to agree on hands synchronisation. Rooms were nicely decorated, of right temperature. And the prices are highly competitive, really surprised me. In Singapore i might find the same service only 4 times more expensive."

Decent value for the money. yes - it's more expensive than many places in Siem Reap, but it's also clean, quiet, and relaxing with great treatments and excellent service. I had 2 treatments today and when I left I setup an appt for 3 hours worth tomorrow. The staff is very professional, the products are lovely, and the treatments were very good. The only bummer was that I forgot that I had a 15% off coupon when I paid, and as I was walking out I asked if it could be honored and I was told I could not use it since the treatments were already registered in the computer...and that it could not be used tomorrow for my spa package. Considering that I was coming back in the morning, it would have been a good customer service move to at least apply the coupon to my next day's treatments, or offer me a small free product. I won't hold this against them though, as I still believe this place offers a good value for what you get, coupon or no coupon! I've had a lot of treatments during my trip in SE Asia and the massage and scrub I received today were amongst the best. Can't wait to see what tomorrow brings."

It's more like a net as it didnt cover much. Hahaha.The room itself is spacious and beautifully decorated. The massage bed is ocmfortable and the towel provided is clean.The massage itself was excellent as we were asked how strong we want the massage to be and the masseuse occasionally asked if we were fine. Once the time is up, we were given time to wash up and change and make our way down to make our payment and given a cup of green tea again.I felt extremely relaxed after the massage and decided to do a Swedish massage for 60 minutes two days after that. This time it was in a partitioned room which is equally comfortable and I get a male masseuse who is very good.By the way, there is also a couple room for couples to have their massage together.I would recommend everyone to come here!"

We asked them to discount the $5 from our bill since we did not intend to go to the ATM. At first, they did not want to discount the $5, but in the end they did, but we had to insist. We had wanted to come back a 2nd time because the massage was really wonderful, but the payment experince really bothered us. We lost an hour because of the payment confusion.

I had a herbal compress oil massage at Bodia and only regretted I didn't have time to come back again for another massage before leaving Siem Reap! The spa is conveniently located down a side street by the Old Market but feels a world away from the bustle of the surrounding streets. As soon as you step inside the atmosphere is cool, calm and relaxing. Reservations are a must although I was able to drop in in the morning and book a treatment for later the same day. On arrival you are brought a cold towel and cool drink, and before your treatment your therapist gives you a refreshing foot bath and scrub with herbs, flowers, salt and citrus slices. Treatment rooms are beautifully appointed and quiet and the whole spa is beautifully designed to create a tranquil but stylish space (if you have mobility issues worth being aware that there are many stairs). The quality of the massage was excellent, so relaxing I almost fell asleep. Afterwards you are brought back downstairs and served delicious hot herbal tea in the attached shop which has a range of very nice home spa products for sale. Staff are polite and speak excellent English. There is an extensive but not overwhelming menu of massages and beauty treatment options to choose from. My only complaint was that on arrival I had to wait 15 minutes before my masseuse collected me from reception - if you have pre-booked that length of wait seems odd and it messed up my plans for afterwards somewhat. Otherwise though I would not hesitate to recommend Bodia. Yes, there are plenty of cheaper options in town for massages etc but you get what you pay for - after a disappointing experience at a different, slightly cheaper spa a couple of days later I really regretted that I hadn't returned to Bodia and paid a few dollars more. Tips are not expected necessarily but I was impressed enough by the quality of the massage and experience at Bodia to tip my masseuse anyway. By European standards the prices are in any case very reasonable for this quality of spa experience - US$36 for an hour long herbal compress massage, although I was able to use a 15% off voucher from a local listings magazine which made the price even more reasonable."

I have had many body treatments around the world but this one has to be right up there with the best. Not only is the service exceptional (herbal tea on arrival, foot bath with herbs and citrus slices before the treatment begins, tatami sandals to wear on your way to the cabine etc) but the treatments are top notch. My daughter and I opted for the body scrub which was just as described on their menu - very professionally administered and simply divine. The therapists are well trained and polite as well as discreet. Cabines are beautifully appointed with not a single element overlooked: calm Cambodian music plays, scented candles flicker, fresh flowers adorn the room, voices are hushed. We opted for the double room which meant my daughter and I could enjoy the experience side by side but if this is not your speed, there are individual cabines of course. We loved it so much that we recommended it to the other travellers on our trip. Each took our recommendation and all loved it! We also went back for seconds prior to departing. Cost wise Bodia is more expensive than many of the other street massage operators in Siem Reap but definitly worth the extra $$$ - around $AUD35 per person for a 1.5 hour treatment. Amazing value by our home standards!!"

There are so many massage and spas in Siem Reap, most of which are poor quality and all look the same, that it's very hard to find a reliable place to relax. Well, one very simple way to avoid ending in a dirty dark room with someone torturing your back and legs is to go to Bodia. Beautiful place, expert therapists, good products, plenty of services,..

The sounds of Pub Street mingled nicely with the most amazing foot massage I've ever had. It was simply divine. All the produce they use is very good, and we found Bodia products in some of the better hotels in Cambodia. They were very clean, professional and the best spa we found in Cambodia. The Bodia spa in Phnom Penh could learn many lessons from its Siem Reap cousin. It's advisable to book, as they seem very popular and can book out quickly. Only regret is that we didn't have a chance to do the four hand massage at Bodia."

The therapist was excellent and I would recommend it to a tired tourist after a temple day tour. However, at the shop I was interested in the tea leaves and the shop assistant recommended the Herbal Tea Infusion box set of 6 types of tea which costs USD$13.50 The box looked quite worn and she said it was the last set as it was very popular. She said the tea can last for 1 year and I purchased the set as souvenirs for friends back home. To my disappointment, I realised that the tea had all expired in June 2014. I should have checked it myself too but this leaves a very poor impression of the shop assistant's honesty and customer service. Very very upsetting. "

First of all, the spa menu stated that there was a choice of massage oil but I wasn't given an option. Then, the two therapists were whispering to each other during the massage. At first, I thought they were talking about what to do but then I heard they were laughing. This happened for a few times. The pressure level applied was inconsistent and the synchronization of the two therapists were not good either. I don't think I would recommend this spa considering that the price wasn't low."

The clock said 6.10 when the therapist started. During the treatment I smelt something which I thought was the products she was applying but then it became clear that the therapist FARTED. Yes, she farted during the treatment. After she started massaging my legs, she told me she needed to go to the bathroom for 5 minutes. She was out for what seemed like 8-10 minutes and when she came back the massage did not continue. She told me the massage was over and when I asked if she added extra time, she said she had.Not so. The clock said 7.00 when she was done. That was less that 55 minutes - considering the time she walked in was 6.10 and the time for the bathroom.When I was asked how the facial was, I expressed my concerns. They removed 15% from the bill. I found this was minuscule, given that the final price was still close to $30 for a very poor and smelly experience. I'm sorry that my one opportunity for a good spa treatment was ruined. The icing on the cake was that the front desk refused my $20 bill and asked me to replace it. What a cheek! I would not visit this spa again."

The treatment included a massage, scrub, moisture treatment and facial. The scrub was probably the best I'd ever had, and the vitamin facial was great, even for someone like me with highly sensitive skin. I thought the cost ($65), was also incredibly reasonable for the services. To be sure, you can find cheaper places for spa services in siem reap. Bodia spa is on the higher end for the area. But I highly doubt the cheaper places have as qualified a staff, as good services, or facilities. All in all this place is very reasonably priced for the five star services received."

The therapist start explaining what she would do, and each time she would do something different, she would explain again- what makes you more confident about the treatment (she was doing it in a very low voice and very politely).

We were supposed to start at 10pm, but they made us wait till 10.30 pm before they took us upstairs to wash our feet. I did say to my friends then that I hoped they were not going to end us at 12 midnight still, as we spent half and hour waiting and already paid the full price. (I paid USD 60 for my two a la carte items and my friends each paid USD 50)We went into a room at a far end closest to the bars and immediately the music from the bars could be heard. It was loud enough for me to hear the lyrics and I asked to change room, but the therapist said there were no other rooms available. The music got much louder as we progressed and it was so bad that at the end of my massage, I had a pounding headache. On top of that, I did not get the head and shoulder massage at all as I had purchased and I found me and my girl friend downstairs by the reception by 5past midnight. She was also disturbed by the music and said she wanted to stop the massage after a while as the music was unbearable and the whole massage was not at all relaxing. I told the reception about the music and how I did not receive the massages that I booked and instead got exactly what my friend paid for, which was cheaper and how the whole session was only 90 mins including foot bath and showers instead of the two full hours that we purchased and the massages were not even good. He blamed it on the therapists and that was the end of it. I felt ripped off for paying more and getting less and I didn't argue as my head was throbbing from the music "

Any variation at this point would bring relief and if I could just make it to then I wouldn't wast my money by walking out.But then the construction started... Hammering... Loudly...

No variation just the same move over and over...Finally I asked politely for them to stop... Got up took a shower and left..At the desk.. An hour before my treatment ended... Just asked me how was my massage.. I politely told them that it was not good...No offer of another service ... No offer of a discount... Just asked to fill out the survey.This is unacceptable.

I appreciate the Cambodian products, and I thought the prices were fair for the services received. I had a mani/pedi--it was good, but not great. I also did a spa package that included a massage and a scrub, and had a bikini wax done. The massage, scrub, and waxing were all excellent--well worth the time and the price. I would definitely recommend that anyone looking to unwind after a day of climbing the temples sign up here."

Bodia has a beautiful and relaxing interior. Their prices are midrange - not as cheap as the storefront street spas, not as expensive as the spas at the larger resorts. The facials were about $30 each.The facial started with tea (and ended with tea) and a foot wash. During the facial we were treated to various delicious smelling natural face cleansers and moisturizers along with massages of the head, shoulders, neck, chest and legs/feet (a welcome surprise while the face mask was setting). The technicians were well trained and the massages were wonderful.The only downside is the spa's proximity to Pub Street and its noise. We had our facials at night after dinner and could hearing the constant thumping of music and noise during our massage. Perhaps this wouldnt be as much of an issue during the day?"

We wanted a nice spa as opposed to one of the cheaper places. This place was beautiful and they treat you extremely well. Before going to your room you get some very tasty tea and a warm foot bath. The rooms are nice, large, and very clean. My partner had an hour massage, and I had a 90-minute four-hand massage, which was amazing. The therapists were very attentive and took direction in terms of the pressure very well. They were also so polite and nice. After the massage, we were given cold tea. The staff was very professional and we were comfortable the entire time. And while you do pay for the exceptional place and service, it's still an amazing deal. My partner and I went back the next day for another treatment, it was so good! If you are looking for a bit of a higher end experience that's still affordable, I highly recommend this place."

First of all, the place is beautiful, truly what a spa should look like. We were greeted with a foot wash and mini massage with flowers and citrus fruit. My masseuse was friendly and professional, offered us a shower if we wanted to beforehand and knew exactly what she was doing. She checked often to make sure the pressure was ok and I loved that underneath the massage table they had a bowl with flowers on the floor so your view would be pleasant when you were face down! That's attention to detail!Even better, the price was like a fifth of what you would normally pay in a hotel or regular spa.I wish I would have had time to get a full day treatment. Definitely recommend!!!"

The staff providing the treatment is very professional and knowledgeable. They are also very quiet and peaceful. This place is a little retreat from the noise and business of the old market and pub street. The only suggestion I have is: The manager needs to do a better job at training the people at the front desk. They need to be more friendly, more welcoming, and more laid back. They are in a hurry for you to choose a treatment and once you finish they want to check you out as soon as possible. Please relax and go with the flow. Allow your customer to take his/her time. Their english could improve by listening attentive to the customer and reflecting on what the customer said before they answer back. Overall, Bodia Spa is very good! Give a try and enjoy it!"

Bodia Spa has the potential to be an outstanding spa - but they have some work to do...The room design is beautiful and the therapists are good - the customer service at the front desk was awful, making it hard to enjoy the experience.First the good news: The welcome with a scented, cold towel and drink is enjoyable. The staff serving it was friendly and welcoming.The room is beautifully designed, generous in size and had a nice, clean shower. The massage tables, sheets and towels are comfortable and clean.We had one excellent massage and one good massage - the therapists were well trained, professional and friendly. Unfortunately, the front desk service spoiled the day: We made a reservation for a couples room, one male therapist, for next day and made a deposit. The lady making the reservation and the front desk staff were wonderful!On the day of the massage, the (male) receptionist told us that there was no couples room available - because they had given it to somebody who didn't have a reservation for that time slot!? When I refused to accept the change and complained, a room became magically available. 10min of back and forth are not the start to a relaxing massage! I also had requested a male therapist for myself - and in came two ladies! Sure enough, my massage was good but too soft - the reason I requested a male therapist in the first place!On checkout, our deposit had not been deducted from the bill - another complaint required to fix it.Messing up three things on one reservation is not acceptable for this level of spa. There are plenty of spas in Siem Reap, from $5 massage shops to luxury spas. At the relative price point of the Bodia Spa, I expect better service. If you don't care about the room or therapist, you might as well go to one of the cheap massage shops. If you want to pamper yourself and enjoy a relaxed treatment, you should look elsewhere."

However after we return back to the spa with required maps, we find there are a stack of maps just near the reception desk on the other entrance!

Hard to tell if my feet felt good afterwards as deep heat or something very similar to deep heat was applied from my knees to my feet meaning my legs felt that burn/ice sensation for ages after but that's all I could feel. My partner said his back, neck, head, massage was good but hard to enjoy when you could hear the whispers and giggling."

The d\u00e9cor was relaxing, stylish and soothing. The masseur was young, but professional; undoubtedly well trained, an expert in technique, and he inspired confidence. I think I probably had the best massage and body scrub I have ever had. His name was Seyha, and I thoroughly recommend him. The Bodia Spa in Siem Reap is a godsend, and if you\u2019re there and in need of a little pampering in expert hands, don\u2019t hesitate to go. It\u2019s worth every cent."

You will pay more for a massage at Bodia, but it is well worth it. After a week of building with Habitat for Humanity, I really needed a massage and so happy I found Bodia. I highly recommend a spa package - I had the 75-minute body (Thai) massage, body scrub, hydration and facial. Three hours for $62. I tried the $8/hour body massage at my three-star hotel before visiting Bodia - the most unpleasant massage experience. You get what you pay for. Considering Bodia's amenities, it was money well spent."

After conquering Angkor Wat for 3 days and earning for some serene experience in the midst of a dusty noisy town, I was so happy to find this gem. The design of the spa, the attention to detail, cleanliness, quietness, open space - all very welcoming right from the start. You're greeted with a offer of a cup of tea - to my surprise, custom made, not some Lipton-variety tea bag type. Then a staff member takes your shoes and places them in a wooden box that is then tucked in the wall behind a reception (just in case you circled temples in $1000 shoes, they're certain to be there when you get back) - great concept. And the massage I got! UNBELIEVABLE! I normally prefer a male masseuse, but this time I didn't request one, and I am so glad. My masseuse, a young woman whose name starts with Ch (shame I don't remember as she deserves all the credit for such review), was the most skillful one of all masseuses I've tried throughout my South East Asian stay. I had a body wrap and reflexology feet massage, which made my feet feel forget all running, hiking and biking under the blazing sun, and prepared them for another 3 months of rigorous hiking ahead. It was so good that the next day I went back for the Bodia classic and chose the lengthiest option they had. This time I specifically asked for the same masseuse and was not disappointed. Her skillful strong hands (surprising for her tiny fragile frame) make you forget all the aches you had from carrying your suitcases or backpacks. And she was so gentle and careful in the areas that seemed to be sunburned, if she felt that something might hurt or if your feet are swollen a little she adjusted her pressure gradually. And what manners! So professional, so gentle. Didn't ask me useless questions, didn't talk about herself, and didn't hint on giving a good tip like I endlessly heard in Thailand in places that charged double of Bodia prices. The experience was totally worth it, and I just wish I had more time to come back again. Thank you!"

My partner and I could be in the same room - he had 1hr back, neck and shoulder massage (US$25 approx) and I had the full body 'Bodia Classic' (Us$28) - i suggest asking for medium to strong pressure. I also think its better to go before 1pm when the entrance isn't so busy as the staff really attend to you and it's a bit of a spoiler if they are bombarded with other tourists! Also, better to go in at least a day before to book and look at the spa 'menu'. They will spoil you with a cold flannel and lemongrass tea just for that which is very nice after a hot look around the old markets."

The therapists didn't seem to know how much pressure was appropriate, but they did always increase/decrease it when I asked.The massage was in a lovely suite with a big bath tub, the tub didn't actually work but they let me move suites when I said that I wanted to have a soak after my massage.This spa is very expensive for Southeast Asia (at about 2/3s the price of my neighbourhood massage place in Australia, it's expensive in comparison to other spas, not just in comparison to street massage places), but I think it's worth it for (if you're staying at the hotel) the convenience."

The spa is still just off Pub st, but is over 3 floors and has some really great value packages.Their prices are just slightly higher than the smaller massage shops nearby, but when you get a private room with shower, toilet, aircon and fresh towels its worth that little bit extra. The large shard massage rooms in the $10/hr massage shops can become a little loud.Congratulations on the expansion, obviously the popularity of this spa has helped to consolidate their position as number 1 on trip advisor.David"

The polish bubbled after application - this is the second experience I have had with this in a couple different spas so I'm not sure if the polish is hold, the humidity and the fact that they don't use fans to dry adds to this, or it is something else."

Bodia was a nice enough spa, and a bargain by Western standards (though it was the most expensive massage I got in Siem Reap at $30/hour). They didn't have private rooms, just curtains that didn't close well separating treatment areas, so it wasn't very private. They treat both men and women there, and it was a little creepy getting a massage next to a male stranger. I wanted to shower before my massage, and they didn't even give me a robe - I had a wear regular-sized bath towel down the hallway. Plus, I didn't like my therapist very much. She kept trying to massage my rear end, though I kept asking her not to and trying to cover my backside with a towel. I know those little Asian women climb up on the table and straddle you when massaging your back (I'm a Asian woman, myself), but it wasn't comfortable for me literally butt naked. I asked her to focus on hands, feet and head, and she barely touched my hands and feet, though she did do a great job with my head. She really didn't speak any English and had no idea what I was asking for, so I gave up. After my massage, I realized my body felt absolutely the same as I did before my massage - same tight areas, same sore areas. So, as I walked around the corner, I saw one of the cheap reflexology places and stopped in. One hour and $6 later, I felt great. That was the best massage I got in Siem Reap, and I wish I had gone there every day instead of the fancy western-style spas."

We booked a 90 min session but the massage only lasted for 70 min. I guess they included the shower time and I wasn't aware of that. The down side was that people were not put in rooms but only separated by thin screenings. My friend and I were not arranged to be next to each other. And I could hear the sound of the massage bed being pressed, people walking around on the wooden floor, and also people talking/phone ringing in the lobby if you are near that area. So if you are easily distracted you might feel not as relaxed as a massage should be. With that price level I actually expected a more quiet environment where I could totally relax. But overall it was a nice experience."

Hot. Hot. Hot. at the end of a beautiful and amazing day at one of the temple sites i ventured into the city. I had read about Bodia Spa in a guide book and thought I will treat myself to a massage. I am so glad that i did. Not only were the staff able to fit me in then and there, I was seated, given a cold drink, treated very gently as i chose my massage and asked my gender preference. the walk up the stairway to the massage rooms was enchanting and the shower was deliciously beautiful lead up to my aromatherapy massage. I chose Ylang Ylang as my oil. An hour went by in total bliss, in peaceful surrounds, with lovely soft music playing and pink lillies in my sight. As i left the massage quarter I was so relaxed I nearly walked into the pond with the flowers. I myself indeed became a floating lotus under the medium pressured hands of my massage therapist. thank you Bodia!"

In our map we picked up from the hotel, there was a 30% discount on all treatment at bodia. We made a booking for massages for three people. On arriving at the spa for our appointment, we asked if we could use the discount coupon. She said it only applied to 1 treatment (though it did not state this on the coupon). We asked if she could apply this discount to all 3 of us (since we all had maps but thought we would only need to bring one) but she said no. First she asked us to go back to our hotels to get 2 more maps for the coupon. After a few minutes she obliged and said she would give us a 25% discount on the 2 subsequent treatments. We agreed to this (5% difference?!) and sat down and waited for our therapists to come. While sitting down in the waiting room, we found more of those maps with the discount voucher in them. We asked if we could use it (so we could all get 30% off) and she proceeded to snatch the map away!!!! And said in an aggressive tone that we weren't allowed to take it (a free map!!!) coz it belonged to her shop?! We asked if she could now extend the 30% discount to all 3 of us now and she still disagreed and was very rude about it!!! We asked for our $10 deposit back as we were so disappointed with how we were treated .. And thankfully she gave it back to us. It did not make sense at all. So they would rather have empty unfilled appointment spots (and lose approx $90 for 3 massages ) rather than extending an extra 5% discount (probably only a few dollars) which we had 3 valid vouchers for anyway. There is seriously something wrong with the managerial staff there, there is no customer service and they are not thinking straight. Don't go there, we've had better experiences else where. And f you do, make sure you pick up the 30% off voucher in the waiting room."

From the moment of arrival, it is clear that this is a special experience.Presented with a cold towel and a tamarind juice, we were offered a choice of oils and asked about areas that needed working on. We were then escorted to exquisitely decorated private rooms and offered showers. The experience was so sublime that I could barely speak at the end.

I had no reservation, and they took me right away. When choosing a spa, the things I care about most are a.) Will the place be clean, comfortable and calming, and b.) will the massage be good. I know that sounds backwards, but I'd rather have a good massage in a place where I feel comfortable than a great massage on a bare table with overhead fluorescents, a loud air conditioner and traffic noise. Luckily, Bodia was beautiful and tranquil inside, and the massage I received was excellent. The lighting was dim and soothing, tables were partitioned by a heavy curtain--I could hear some mumbles from the next person over, but nothing distracting--and there was a hushed peace about the place. There's a private shower if you'd like to wash off the day's dust, though the water pressure wasn't very strong when I was there. I asked for the aromatherapy massage, and I found that the style is definitely a little different from a typical Swedish massage, but still felt great on my back and legs. My masseuse was very good; she started with a lighter touch, but was able to provide a much firmer massage when I asked her to. Her English was surprisingly good, and we were able to communicate just fine.No doubt, there are cheaper massages in Siem Reap, and if you're on a backpacker's budget, you may want to look around. But for a few dollars more--and we're talking, like, 12 dollars more, you get a spa experience equivalent to many in the States. I will be returning to Bodia Spa again before I leave Siem Reap. Tips: Make sure you communicate with your masseur/masseuse: If you like a firmer touch, tell them so. Also, don't be afraid to chat with the people at the front desk about what you're looking for; their English was also excellent. Go for a 90-minute massage, because the one-hour goes by too fast. And lastly, this place accepts credit cards, which is a really nice convenience."

We went inside and it was very tranquil and spa/zen like. We were greeted with cold towels and Tamarind juice even though we had only popped in to look at their service menu. We were instantly sold and booked in for later that day.I had the four hand massage which was a first for me and was just blissful. My friends had the head and shoulder massage and the hot herb compress massage and both were impressed. I was in a curtained off room and privacy could be a bit of an issue as I could see glimpses into the other cubicles as I walked by but it wasn't a deal breaker by any means. My two therapists were a bit giggly at first which I found off putting but they soon shut up and after that the massage was blissful and they kept me covered appropriately at all times. It was well worth the USD30 it cost after the discount - I am sure a similar massage in a nice spa in the UK would be well over \u00a3100 so to me it was excellent value. On completion they leave you in private to get dressed and then you are served herbal tea and a cold towel in the reception area. I would definitely go back if I am in Siem Reap again."

Their services always exceed my expectation, from welcoming at check-in to the actual massage. Their therapists are well trained unlike other places that do not know what they are doing (avoid those $5/$10 an hour massages - not worth it!). Definitely a high recommendation from me and one of the places to visit while in Phnom Penh."

THE only negative thing I experienced is that during scrub you might feel quite cold. Maybe the air-conditioning is on higher level : ok for massage but not fir scrub procedure...Definitely place to experience!"

Welcome was good, with tea and cold towels served when we first arrived, and cool pandanus water served when services had been rendered.Thought we would check this place out as we thought we had 30% off from a coupon, but was told after we had paid the deposit that the discount was only applicable for individual treatments and not for packages, which we had opted for. As we didn't mind the price of usd48 for a 2 hour massage and body scrub we decided to go ahead with it.The rooms looked nice, but I could not help but feel self-conscious, as the room doorways were only covered with curtains. During the service I also noticed that another masseuse had popped her head in to ask my masseuse a question, whilst i'm laying there starkers. I could also hear people coming up and down the stairs very close to the curtain that was shielding me from the hallway. The massage was nothing to write home about. After the body scrub I was asked to rinse it off in the private shower stall, but I notice that you could potentially see the reflection of the person in the next room drying themselves off after a shower! This was fine for me as my husband was in the next room, but what if that was not the case?Retrospectively, we can't help but wonder that we should have gotten our spa package from our hotel?"

            "review": "Won't go back again. I booked a \"Bodia relexation\" while staying the Heritage suites hotel, where a Bodia Spa boutique is inside of, I couldn't wait to call for booking as sooner as I finished check-in. This package is a 3 hours treatment including Steam bath, body scrub, aromatic massage and a vitamin C facial treatment, which seems to be perfect for a tiring day visiting the temples, my booking of 8:30pm was more than better because they are closed late at 12:00(super!), I was really excited about my body treatment after dinner but the tragedy seemed to be just a beginning.First, 15 minutes after the confirmation the receptionist called me again to ask if I can arrive tonight a little bit earlier because they were fully booked that the therapist could be in a rush, so I ask what time I should arrive if it's better for them to arrange the schedule of therapist, and she answered \"10minutes\"... Okay, a little bit strange but I accepted. As a result of that, I was arrived at 8:15pm, 15 minutes before my booking time, and receptionist came with tea and cold towels, which is normal procedure in any other spa. Then, she gave me the bill, marked the price and asked me to sign and write down the tips I would pay. I don't want to say it's rude, but I do feel uncomfortable being asked to do this, so I asked them gently \"may I sign my room number first then add the tips after the treatment?\", but the receptionist answered \"no, because you are the last customer today, and it's late now, please sign and write down tips first so that you can go back to hotel room directly after treatment.\" OKAY, but I was not convinced at all!! Yet anyway I signed, it was USD105+10.5TVA, and I make a somme USD120 in total.Then, immediately I was sent to the spa room, the receptionist explain me to take a brief shower first and go to the steam room(which I have the same in my suite) for 15minutes, and she said that the therapist will knock my door while 15minutes time pass through. And I asked her if she could provide me some make-up remover because I just came back from dinner with my make-up on face, but she said that \"no, you just wash it first then the therapist will help to remove it before doing facial treatment.\" Well... OKAY... so I came to the shower and steam bath with my perfect make-up for night clubbing... how ridiculous and how dirty it is!!The most crazy thing is, in the steam room, I kept waiting someone to knock my door and tell me 15minutes is finished. But no, not any, I saw a women walk by twice without approaching my door and wondered if it's time-up or not, I went out when she passed by the 3rd time and asked her about the time. And she looked at me without patience, said \"ok, I'm waiting for you long time ago.\"... voila here my therapist is!! A little angry and embarrassed, I was wet and felt cold standing there and don't know what would be happen if I didn't come out and ask, but I don't have time to think about this, immediately she asked me to lie down on the bed without wiping my body. I thought she should at least cover me with a dry towel or a sheet, yet she was disappeared!! I was left alone in the room, kept waiting and felt cold and wet with lots of water on the body, then about 5~10 minutes later, the receptionist came to apologize for the breakdown of lighting in this room, so I was asked to go through the garden outside and change the spa room, naked with towel covering... (I do catch a serious cold after this terrible day, cannot stop coughing during the rest of treatment and my whole holiday!!)But if you think it's the worst that will be a big mistake, after setting up in another spa room, I got a completely freezing body, but the therapist didn't do anything to make me warm but just hurrying doing her aromatic massage (in order to finish treatment on time and go home earlier?? I'm not sure.) The massage was awful, she didn't have any strength, and don't talk about the skills!!! I asked her to do it stronger but she seemed make her best already, besides she doesn't understand any English!! From here I start to feel regret and think it would be a big mistake to come here to be tortured.After the massage she started to do the body scrub, the salt is quite hard and sharp sometimes, and she didn't do it gently. My legs, arms and back (where the skin layer is thiner) were all scratched by the body salt, and started to feel hurt(yet I found the wound until coming back to hotel). During the treatment she is quiet, and every time she asked me to turn over my body by calling \"excuse me, excuse me!!\" for several time if I fell asleep, instead of \"Madam\" or my name.Finally, the facial... as I've mentioned before, I didn't have any product to remove my make-up, so I asked the receptionist to transmit my message to therapist 3 times that I need to remove carefully the make-up on my face before the facial treatment. But she did it roughly, really terrible you can imagine, I can even see my eyeshadow and lip gross after coming back my hotel suite!! Besides, she made the mask drop into my eyes several times with her rough massage skill, and she seemed ignores my objection while I asked her not to touch my eyes!! Anyway, fine, it seemed that she cannot understand English, so I couldn't do anything but just bear it. I'm pretty sure that BODIA product line is good, and the mask makes skin bright, but not with this kind of terrible therapist!!!After the whole treatment (thank God!!!), I thought that I should go back directly to my hotel suite as the receptionist said in the beginning, but things happen strangely, I was still invited to the reception room and have my warm tea and cold towel. So, anyone can tell me why she insisted that I should sign for the tips before the treatment? Then, the receptionist asked me how was the treatment, and I answered gently \"terrible, we had big problems in communication.\" However, she just looked at me and smiled, answered \"really?\" without apologizing, IT\"S REALLY CRAZY!!! I didn't finish my tea and went back to the hotel with angriness, and I'm sure that I won't go back again!! Next time I'd go to Frangipani, the top 1 spa in Siem Reap for me."

Overall, the service is very good, the staff are friendly and attentive and the setting is just beautiful, very clean and amazingly tranquil, quiet and cool. Depending on how busy it is sometimes you can walk in off the street, other times you need to book. They serve you a beautiful chilled drink when you arrive, while you choose the treatment you want. After the treatment you are given a warm tea. Very lovely! I have had two massages here, one done by a male and one by a female. They both asked how hard or soft I like the massage before they started, and periodically check with you that everything is okay. My experience here has always been they go well over time rather than under time, so make sure you allow plenty of time for the experience, as their price list gives only a guide as to how long the treatment will take. The manicure/pedicure staff are lovely young ladies and some speak some English. I think for the price, Bodia Spa is a perfect indulgence while in Siem Reap. Yes, more expensive than the street-side massage and manicure places, but much better quality and better trained staff in a beautiful air conditioned setting. It is not a 5 star resort style spa that you might find in say, Hawaii, but it doesn't cost a bomb either. Bodia has a lovely range of products they sell as well."

They also have their own product line which I thought was a sign of high quality. The welcome was good and there is undoubtedly a luxurious ambience to the place. I had a 90 minute massage which cost USD 38 - a higher end price for Siem Reap. They asked me if it was OK with me if the masseur was male - I said this would be fine. I also thought this may mean a firmer massage which I needed after a day at the temples! However it was not as firm as I was expecting and on reflection I would describe it as OK at best. I may have given it a better review had I not had a much better experience at a different spa the next day! I suspect that the service here may depend on the massuer - the masseur I had seemed fairly young and was perhaps just not very experienced. But then again in a spa charging these prices there should be a higher degree of quality control. I can see that there are some very good reviews for this spa on Trip Advisor so perhaps I was just unlucky. Overall my advice would be that if you are looking for a higher-end spa experience, it is worth looking around a few places before deciding where to go."

I visited this place following the good reviews that I saw on this site, even though I was staying in a hotel that offered superb spa services. I got a male attendant but on hind sight should have insisted on a female one. Now, if the spa is top-class, its attendants should not have hard cuticles and hairy arms. The attendant who gave me the 1.5 hr massage (US$44) had these issues and it spoilt the entire experience. He seemed inexperienced and new and when he massaged my arms, he pressed them down on the bed so hard that his nails dug into my skin and it hurt! Honestly, the attendants should not press the client's arms on the bed especially when the clients are thin and bony; instead, they should lift their arms up for the massage. The pressure applied was also inconsistent. Half the time, it appeared as if he was merely \"smoothing\" the oil onto my skin. I think the issue is also because his English is rather bad and he does not quite understand what I was trying to tell him. The huge turn-off however was the hair on his arms. Yeewks! Honestly, I would not recommend this place to any friend or stranger. There are so many spas in Cambodia - pay a few more dollars and you can get good ones at Sokha Angkor Resort(Jasmine spa); pay lesser and you can get a great experience at BodyTune (city area)."

Skip the dingy $4 places and (almost) splurge on this magical vacation-within-a-vacation."

I would have been there everyday. The massage was excellent and the ladies who work there were so kind and accomodating. The spa is elegant in a casual, easy way. It was my favorite spa experience in siem reap... Well priced, and such a lovely experience. Also it is located on a beautiful little street that is also not to be missed. Highly recommended."

Both treatments were outstanding.Excellent value for money compared to western prices but top quality. You get 10% off if you book 2 treatments. Tip: allow plenty of time as treatments can over run, no rushing in this place thankfully! Get your hotel to book you a taxi or tuk tuk here as many places have a similar name."

I am a \"career\" spa lover and my son and traveling companion was a complete novice. Frangipani was perfect. You are in spa mode immediately upon entering. The lobby is quiet, calm, and beautifully appointed. After being greeted we took a seat and were offered a refreshment. As we sipped our massage technicians arrived quietly with bowls of scented water and bathed our feet. We were ready for whatever was next! We booked the Anti-stress massage for 30 and the reflexology massage for 60 minutes and were both so completely relaxed by the end we wanted to just stay there and do more. The staff was gracious and excellent at making this spa experience one of my favorites ever. My son indicated that as his first he was now a little afraid to try anywhere else because he simply couldn't imagine topping the experience. All this and of course for a small percentage of the cost in a spa elsewhere. Do this after a long temple trek."

Then the foot massage began, along with a cold iced tea, while we decided on what kind of massage to get by reading the selections. This preamble was most unexpected and so divine! The hour massage was heavenly - truly! So relaxing, so enjoyable. The only equivalent in the United States would be one at a very luxurious spa and that would cost $300! So impressive and a most PERFECT ending to a long day. By the way.... We went back the next evening it was so good!"

In Siem Reap, of course you may find plenty of inexpensive massage and spa places, I would say, since im a Siem reap resident, that you probably get what you pay for. Prices on the spa menu here are on mid-range to high however there is 30% disc on offer if you come on Sunday. I have tried several treatments i.e. special house blended aroma oil massage, 4-hand Thai massage, and Ceramic bamboo pressure massage with warming vocalnic substances, pretty unique and refreshing after I finished my treatment. I havent done it anywhere else. Do try if youre looking for something new with pressure point relief style massge. This is one of my fav treatment . The masseuses were polite and well-trained. The place is really well-kept and relaxing. Iwas still louging awhile chatting with friendly spa manager,Cherry, after my treatment. attention to details that they have put into the place and treatments is tremendous. Forget about the price, it worths every dollar here. Btw they also serve one of a kind watermelon juiced crispy rice cake after your treatment, loved it."

Eyes it is a little dearer than some of the basic spas that litter SiemReap but it is not an equal experience or fair comparison and Frangipani is exceptional value. Frangipani is also on one of the hippest streets in Siem Reap with eclectic shops, great coffee (and hairdresser) at Little Red Fox, and great vibe so make sure you have some time before you head of to your treatment to explore."

We had visited one of the more local massage places earlier in our visit and were very disappointed - but i guess you pay for what you get. Frangipani is a little more expensive - but nothing near spa prices in other countries. We opted for the 1 hour Sports Massage which was priced at $35. From the moment we were met at the curb side we were treated like special guests. The place was peaceful, clean and I loved the large piece of art on the wall beside us when our feet were washed and we drank our cool \"health drink\". The massage itself was choreographed to be a relaxing, pleasurable and incredibly positive experience. The use of warm and cool through the massage itself and the towels was just right.We highly recommend Frangipani.FYI - Frangipani is one of a group of about 10 businesses in the area (street) that work together. They are worth exploring before or after your massage."

On the same day we arrived in Siem Reap, we checked into this beautiful spa with a hanging garden and warm greetings upon walking through the door.We enjoyed the butterfly pea flower tea that changes color when sugar syrup is added. The neat shelves of merchandise including clothes , butterfly pea flowers, elaborate rings made of wood, aromatic oils and more were reasonably priced. Do not be fooled into thinking that these items can be found in the day or night markets - we found nothing close to them.He chose an aromatherapy massage package while I wanted the four hands massage for 90 minutes. We were escorted to a couple room two to three flights of stairs up. It was a big house with comfortable wooden floors and very well kept.It seemed like he fell into a deep sleep midway into the massage. While I was struggling to not wince in pain every other second, but that effort was fruitless. I was in pain! Because it was a four hands massage, there were two therapists who sometimes worked together on my back, or at other times took turns to release the knots.One of them was alright - it was pleasant enough. The other lady masseuse was digging so hard into my back at first, I thought she was trying to tear through my skin and rip out my spine! Honestly, when I flew home a few days later, my back was in pain for a week. I couldn't walk properly or bend over or stand for long.Throughout the 90 minutes, even though I went \"owwww!\" Too many times, or told her to not push so hard, the masseuse never let up. Even on my scalp. It was as though she was teying to free my brain by prying open my head.OMG. But he was in dreamland so I guess over here it really depends on who the therapist who works on you.Would we visit again? Of course! The service and smiles and warm reception were worth it. And he did have a peaceful and relaxing time over here.Go please, but avoid hardcore fingers!"

The whole experience starts from the entrance to the spa and the beautiful reception area. Our couple massage room is big, clean and with an outdoor shower though the air-cond coolness can be improved given the heat out there. My treatment started with a complimentary foot spa which was very refreshing to the feet. Then I had a seaweed scrub which was so refreshing to the skin that made me want to stay under the outdoor shower forever. The scrub itself was done very nicely with nice strokes making it one of the most relaxing scrub I ever had.I continued with the aromatherapy massage which was heavenly. My therapist has just the perfect blend of long flowing strokes and pressure to give one of the best massage I ever had. This's after having a more than good massage at Shinta Mani Club's spa the day before. The refreshment they served before and after our treatment was also a nice touch to the whole experience. After all being said, the experience does comes with a price if you compare with those offer off the streets. Spa experience being a very personal thing it's worth for you to visit the place and decide if it's the spa for you and your money"

After a tough day of cycling around Angkor, I decided to go for a 1-hr sports massage which promises to relieve sore muscles with deep pressure techniques. Glad to say that it was a great decision, as it was one of the best deep pressure massage I've ever had!Frangipani is located in a quiet district just 10 min walk away from Pub Street, and just a stone's throw from the cosy Common Grounds Cafe, so it's ideal to visit them both. Both spa and cafe close pretty early at 8 pm so be early, and it's best to make an appointment with the spa a day before as they are quite packed.I was treated to a foot bath and delightful drink before the massage. My masseuse, whose name is Mom, was extremely professional was simply gave the impression that she was very well trained. I've never visited high end spas but I reckon her service would have been on par with the most luxurious of spas. The bottom line was that after an hour of massage, I was really satisfied as it effectively eliminated all the sore muscles on my shoulders and legs. Amazing!After the massage there was also a really nice cup of tea, not the usual tea, but a flavoursome one. Full credit to the spa for their attention to every detail which contributed to one of the best massage experience I've had. Of course, it was relatively more expensive than other massages in Siem Reap (around USD30-40 per hour), it was worth every dollar.Highly recommended to visit it at least once if you visit Siem Reap."

The treatments selected were a 30 min scrub followed by a 1hour seaweed body wrap & to finish a 1 hour aromatherapy massage. We both had superb therapists work on us for 3 delightful hours taking our senses on an unforgettable journey, restoring balance, happiness & a relaxing calm along the way. We were in such a heightened state of bliss that we were able to reflect & relive our wonderful time spent here wafting through temples, gliding through water villages, standing at the foot of a beautiful waterfall.. All while lying horizontal on a massage bed at the wonderful Frangipani spa. I Highly recommend a visit to this simply devine spa for an opportunity to restore happiness at every level something hard to achieve in everyday life. "

The spa itself is beautiful, set back on a quiet french architecture-ridden street outside of Siem Reap proper. It is surrounded by beautifully maintained gardens, and they maximize their size big time. The entrance is incredibly relaxing and beautiful, with small ponds and interesting architecture and beautiful tones in the lobby space. I was immediately seated in a beautiful wooden chair and my treatment started with a foot massage nd scrub, which I had not realized. I then was brought upstairs for my massage-- a deep tissue sports massage. Now I've seen some of the best physical therapists and sports masseuses and been to some phenomenal spas in the States, but this was one of the best massages I have ever had. She did such a fantastic job and I have felt great for days (should also mention that I am twenty two with a herniated disc and shoulder issues from muscle anxiety). After, I had a nice cup of tea while I read my book. The service was wonderful. I will definitely be back."

It was recommended by a friend but you can find the address in the local Siem Reap guide. Whatever reason you pick to go (temples tiredness or body issues) just book in advance there for a great relaxing and massage specially if you care about hygiene and cleanliness! The reception area makes you feel just right and cosy with buddhas in colors, lovely decoration and tamed lights. They serve you relaxing and energizing teas (ginger) that change colors with the addition of lemon to make you feel comfortable and the wooden furniture makes the rest. The staff is very welcoming and professional. First your feet are taken care in a special oily bath with frangipani before going upstairs for the special treatment with aromatherapy you have picked. You can also enjoy nail art. The staff makes everything to please you. You can get 1/2 hour massage or a more complete pampering or scrub ( feet, face, body... )from 1 hour to 90 minutes. You can have 2 treatments in a row too for example feet and back. It's clearly stated in their leaflet. It will cost you from $25-50 on the average. Your feet, body and soul will say thank you! I highly recommend this place for men and women even though from the outside it does not look a palace. All tuk tuks (local motorcycle rickshaw) know the area."

There are many spa/massage places to be found in the town centre and while many of them offer very attractive rates ( an hour's massage for USD8 before discount) I would not really recommend them unless you are not at all bothered about the ambience or hygiene of the place. After visiting one such place, I was really relieved to find Frangipani Spa, as soon as you enter the place it feels almost like someone's very cosy villa and the complimentary foot bath before any spa service was very nice.We really enjoyed their aromatherapy massages especially the 4 hand massage-amazing! It is more expensive than the other spas mentioned but well worth the price to have a nice professional relaxing environment and it is still much more reasonable that hotel spas. The only thing is it is on an obscure street and there is no proper road sign so be sure to really check the map before you set out to find it!"

Then taken to spotless treatment rooms. Yes - rooms- not curtained cubicles or chairs on the street. And proper massage tables not mattress on the floor. Everything is very classy. I had an hour aromatherapy massage for $25, husband had $46 4 hands massage which he said was one of best massages he has ever had. And he is a massage junkie! The masseurs were obviously trained and very different to the \"poke and prod\" massages you get off the street.Obviously more expensive than most massages in siem reap but well worth it."

(I did a tropical wrap) is a nice combination of scrub and wrap.

I just did the 21km Angkor Wat run and decided to do the Sports Deep Tissue Massage & Herbal Hotpress which cost me around USD40. This is higher than the average cost of massages in Siem Reap, but it came with a lot of good service.I arrived early at about 340pm and the staff attended to me immediately with a foot scrub and some blue drink. The massuese introduced herself and asked me if i had any restrictions. I told her of my bruised ankle and then she led me to my room.The massage room was painted with a tree and had 2 proper massage beds. It had a shower room as well (but no toilet). I undressed and got my massage on.I expected the deep tissue massage to hurt me, but it didn't much. The massage was deep and intense enough for the muscles to twitch in surprise but relaxing enough to put me to sleep. The herbal compress was hot and warm and totally relaxed me. I would recommend this combination for a rejuvenation treatment after a hard day out. The masseuse took good care not to press hard on my injured ankle so i greatly appreciated that.Once done, i was served with their ginger tea. I was offered if i needed a tuktuk but i decided to walk back to town instead. This was about 10mins walk... I will definitely come back here with my friends or partner... :)"

I had a decent massage and was satisfied. The tuk tuk driver took me to the Frangipani Villa Hotel first, and had no idea where this place was, even though I showed him on a map. I ended up having to direct him there, so be prepared. He offered to wait, and I turned him down because I wasn't sure how long my treatment would be. I wish I had asked him to wait, because it's in a creepy little alley and I had to walk out to the main road and wander before I could find a ride back to my hotel. Siem Reap is a great place to spa - I visited 4 decent spas in my 3 days in Siem Reap and spent less than half of what I would have spent for 1 treatment near where I live."

We began with a cold drink and a flower filled foot bath on a hot day when the electricity had failed and there was no power to most of the buildings (including this one). Nevertheless we ordered a massage for two. I found the massage relaxing and reasonably competent although my partner had a little difficulty - he was unable to communicate his request for a stronger massage. The prices were very moderate making this the best value spa experience for us in Siem Reap (taking into account what you received). Overall I thought this spa provided a good relaxation massage and an excellent spa experience in a lovely environment. I would dearly love to have returned for another, but this was the day we flew home."

As soon as you walk into the spa you feel relaxed and start your treatment with a foot soak. I had a 1 hour massage and a 30 minute pedicure, however I was so spoilt and they treated me for about 2 hours. They only had 1 or 2 person rooms so me and my sister went in 1 room, and my mother went into another room. I had the massage and pedicure all while lying on the same massage bed. The room was a perfect temperature and so peaceful. I asked for a soft massage and that\u2019s exactly what I got, I didn\u2019t have to ask the lady to be more gentle. I have had massages before in 5 star hotels and I can honestly say that Frangipani spa was better! The nail polish they used (I got to choose my colour) was top quality and did not chip off at all (it lasted for weeks).The spa is on a side street but our tuk tuk driver had heard of it and knew where to take us.The prices are listed on their website and are very reasonable. So reasonable that I left them a nice tip at the end as I was left so relaxed and happy."

From the reviews, I was expecting the best massage of my trip, but it was not so. I preferred both of my massages in Ho Chi Minh City to this one I took in Siem Reap.Getting to the place isn't hard since you can walk to it from the Riviera Hotel (my tuk tuk driver referred to it as the Rivera). The inside of the spa is nice; definitely a serene environment. After entering the spa, I received a foot bath in the waiting area using some salts. They also offer a cold drink and a facial towel since the weather was muggy and hot. After I selected my oil, the person who washed my feet escorted me up into a massage room (she's also the therapist). There are no lockers so I just put my stuff on the floor. I donned a pair of their boxers and lied belly down to receive my massage. For the price, I think it was an okay massage. My therapist spoke limited English and the technique was average.After the massage, I received another cold drink and crispy rice cake thing. I ate lunch afterwords and my skin was a magnet for the flies; I sure hope it wasn't the fragrant oils."

            "review": "...like a symphony on your body. In sharp contrast to the chaotic hustle of most of Siem Reap, Frangipani undeniably sets the perfect tone for a peaceful, unhurried and elegant spa experience. If you are the sort of person who is seeking complete rejuvenation after a long sweaty day at the temples, spending one or two hours at Frangipani will be well worth the time and expense. Tucked away on a quiet side street off the main Siem Reap drag, Frangipani's unassuming business front is easy to pass by without notice. However, on second glance, one realizes that its modern design and simple colorings set this place apart from some of the more ostentatious store fronts found in the rest of the city. One peak through the large double front doors and you are suddenly transported into vibrant and hip reception area reminiscent of an urban design show room. It's hard not to look for a price tag on the teak furniture or the contemporary original art hanging on the walls.Upon entering the establishment, the owners (presumably the couple who greet you) will quickly guide you to take off your shoes and seat yourself on one of the reclining chairs. As with most Siem Reap businesses, communication in English works well and the spa menu is very clear about choices and pricing. Reasonably priced by Western standards, visitors should fully take advantage of specialty treatments such as the 4-hands massage at approximately $60 USD, which would easily cost closer to $1000 USD for the equivalent quality in any Developed nation. After choosing your treatment, you are given an option of choosing a relaxing fragrance and following that a warm foot massage with coarse salts.My wife and I patronized Frangipani on two consecutive days. On both visits, I chose the 4 hands massage. My two therapists were incredibly well-trained and professional. I can only describe the 4-hands massage as a symphony on your body. The individual work of each therapist was indistinguishable as they combined to create one harmonious massage. The facility had couples rooms available, of which we took advantage both visits. The post-massage experience is equally as relaxing. Staff do not hurry to secure payment or send you on your way. Sip on a cool juice and thumb through the local ex-pat magazines with their excellent restaurant and bar guides. A great place to end your day and plan your night."

From the moment I stepped in, I was offered a cold, scented towel and tea (both before and after treatments). The therapist was very professional and made sure I was comfortable all the time.Overall, a real treat without being pretentious - I think it is worth the extra money and will be back!TIP!

It was not the easiest place to find and google maps can't find the street. As you face ANZ bank head about 5o metres to the west and turn right into the street walk towards the end it will be on your right.I booked an hour massage and was provided with a complimentary foot massage, as well as a welcome drink. After the foot treatment, i was led upstairs for the massage. I am no connoiseur but the massage was superb, she had strong hands and was able to relieve the aches in the legs and shoulders. After the massage i was provided with the option of a cold or hot drink. My treatment was $25 but i think it's the best $25 i have spent Siem Reap!"

The sports massage is fantastic, we had it twice but it is deep tissue massage so people who prefer it lighter may not like it. We also tried the Foot Reflexology which was also really therapeutic. Our last visit was the Four Hands massage but we requested a four hands sports massage. I enjoyed this one the least as it was just too complicated, I think the 2 therapists were too busy co ordinating their movements and less attention was paid to all the relevant sore spots. Just the normal sports massage is great. I did not have any spa or beauty treatments here.The place is very clean, no mossies, and we got private rooms which was very nice. Upon arrival they give you a foot bath and drink and cold towel which is also very good. After the treatment ask for the hot ginger tea which was heavenly. I believe if you ask, they will arrange for a tuk tuk to pick you up from your hotel free of charge."

All the treatments were exceptional, especially the Aromatherapy Massage and we knew we were in very well-trained and professional hands the entire time.We left the Spa feeling very relaxed and more than satisfied with the experience.

It's clean, well-equipped, professional, and the colour-changing drink they serve you before your massage is a cute touch. I'm not sure it warrants the amount you pay for a massage though - while this is well below Western prices, it's still higher than a lot of places in Asia. I just had a regular oil massage - perhaps try one of the fancier treatments for a more \"stand-out\" experience."

All customers receive a beautifully cooling foot wash in basin with frangipani flowers and some ginger slices(don't laugh - you absolutely need this after siem reap's very dusty air). We visited twice for manicures, pedicures, leg massages (needed after a few days of templing) and aromatherapy massages. Technicians have very little english but well used to 'organizing' foreigners.

I went to Frangipani Spa on Mar 30 without high expectations since it was the first spa I've tried in Siem Reap thanks to Tripadvisor reviews, when I asked my hotel to make a reservation for me they even asked if I need a free pick-up service from my hotel! With 5 minutes tuk-tuk drive from old market where my hotel located, soon I arrived their boutique with 2 therapeutists smiling to me and receiving me in the most polite way you can imagine. They immediately offered a delicious welcoming drink and cold wet towels before all, then they make my tired feet soaking into warm water with flowers, lemons, and some essence oil while I was checking the menu to choose which massage I'd try. I chose aromatic massage which they recommend as the most popular one, and they provide 4 kinds of essence oils for me to choose my favorite aroma, which is really thoughtful, and thanks god the staff speak excellent English so that they can understand your need easily. (Unlike some other spa in Siem Reap, sometimes the therapeutists totally don't understand what you talk about!!)Then, after a brief salt scrub of feet(additional service!!) for waiting my finishing the welcoming drink, I went to the massage room upstairs. I have to say it's really a nice in detail, clean, and well-decorated spa room with a private shower inside, and the massage is definitely the best I've ever tried all over the world. Besides, after the massage, they even offered some rice cookies and warm ginger tea for me without pushing in any hurry, I really had a good time there. And all of this, it took only 25USD!! Incredible price, really good value of money, and I won't be hesitate to give some more tips.During my stay in Siem Reap, I've also tried Bodia (in the Heritage suite hotel ) and the famous Lotus Blanc Spa (of Victoria Resort & spa) after, their price were twice or three times of Frangipani's price, but there's no any other spa as good as Frangipani!! I'd consider Frangipani Spa as a \"Must-go\" during your stay in Siem Reap, especially after a long visit of temple, I'm pretty sure you can realize how good it is after doing massage here!"

Frangipani was the third place I went to and it was the best by miles! It was quite hard to find as the map I had was not great - it is close to the Central Market so not exactly in the centre. But it was so worth it once I found it!It is at the higher end in terms of price but it really was a cut above in terms of quality of service. I just walked in one evening and they fitted me in - there was a lovely welcome drink (also a drink and snacks after the massage)!I went for the \"After Angkor\" package which was foot relexology + massage - total 90 minutes. It cost USD 40 which was really good value for the standard of massage. It was a female masseuse but she was really quite firm - just what I needed - and better than the weaker massage I had had elsewhere from a male masseur.The treatment rom was beautiful with an outdoor shower on the roof and the ambience in the waiting area was very relaxing. I would recommend Frangipani to anyone visiting Siem Reap."

It was the perfect day for a spa day as most of the afternoon was pouring rain. It was relaxing to hear the rain coming down. They start you off by taking you the lounge area to have your feet washed and enjoy a cup of cold tea. They then take you to your massage room. When done, you head back to the lounge to take a survey and provided with a warm towel and warm ginger/honey tea.You can go there early to enjoy their sauna (both hot and cold) and their jacuzzi (both hot and cold).I thought the price for the 3 hours to be very reasonable as compared to what I would have to pay in the US. It is all relative based on where you live.Overall, a great experience and felt got my moneys worth. I would recommend to the spa to include an area where towels are readily available - I did not find any and for staff to advise guest where slippers are - I wore my flip flops and got them wet and later saw underneath the table some shoes I could have worn instead.If I come back to this hotel, I definitely would do the spa again."

Service is a bit pricy, but once in a lifetime is a must! I have joined a hot day excape package with aloe body wrap (which you will be slighted wrapped and take a shower afterwards), followed by a coconut oil therapy and facial. Therapists are skilled but i think not heavy enough. And customers are free to use their swimming pool, jacuzzi and sauna. Should give a try!"

The spa place itself is really amazing, from the time you are greeted at the reception to the end, it is a splendid experience. My masseuse was 'Mom' and she was superb, wish I had gone for another round of a full body massage. All in all a great experience and even though the massage is a bit more expensive than what you will get outside, I definitely recommend this experience (and it is a spa not just a massage place with 20 beds lined up together). It is worth it!"

It is a full service spa with individual, air conditioned treatment rooms. Each treatment starts with a foot soak, cold towel and tea. Each ends with a warm towel neck massage and hot tea with ginger and honey. The massages, scrub and wrap treatments were all equivalent with any first class spa. The only reason for not giving 5 stars is that the cost is a goodly percent (about 25%) more than some of the nice spas in town (which we also tried). However, you can't beat this for convenience if you're staying at the hotel and it is still much cheaper than spa costs in the US."

The spa is located in a very convenient location within the city , at the Borei Angkor hotel. Although we weren't staying at the hotel and we emailed them at the last minute,Our appointments were booked promptly . The prices are reasonable and at par with any 5 star spa. All the therapists - Vina, Sokha, Dany and Soma were well trained. The manager , Mr Vitou Y went out of his way to make our visit memorable . We availed three spa packages: Jasmine paradise , Mudita Harmony and Khmer Chol mlob and were very happy with all three. The drinks they offer before and after all treatments are delicious. The beauty products they use are freshly made from organic ingredients like lemon grass, green ginger, honey , mango and jasmine. We fell in love with the calming oil ( sweet orange, cinnamon and lavender) and even bought a bottle to take home.The spa was one of the highlights of our trip. The Khmer Chol Mlob is must try if you are looking to truly relax and rejuvenate your senses. We would like to visit Mudita spa again when we are next in Siem Reap."

Given the low volume of use, they are not turned on until used. I suggest they keep things open to attract more customers. The only item really missing is a nice tranquility room. The reception is not a valid alternative and has an annoying sunroof. They really need a place for people to relax before and after a massage with beds and quiet music. I would like to have relaxed but did not have a place. The therapists I had were fantastic (Sambo and Dany). Their massage skills are comparable to any resort in the world, but at a fraction of the price ($60 for an hour). The lack of English was a minor issue. The rest of our group had good massages as well, but some were less impressed with their therapist than others. The treatment rooms were very nice and had showers for cleanup after. One time, mine ran out of soap. Despite an amazing spa, we had two problems. First, the receptionist was rude to the young women in our group and lied about availability to save prime slots. Had I heard of this sooner, I would have complained, as this was atypical of the great service elsewhere. Also, the manicure my daughter had fell off the next day. This was disappointing."

The massage therapist was very experienced and knew about all the trigger points in the back and the legs and how much pressure to apply. They were very skilled, professional and had good spa etiquette. The hot and cold tea before and after the massage, the refreshing spearmint scented face towels and the calm ambience of the room with soothing music only made this experience more memorable.

The services were a great value--very reasonable prices! They greeted us warmly. We loved the foot baths in the beginning and the teas were delicious! I felt very relaxed and comfortable. My first service was a foot reflexology course. The masseuse was wonderful and I thoroughly enjoyed it because of all the walking I'd been doing. The second service I booked was the coconut oil hair treatment. I loved the smell and the service was top-notch. I wish I'd stayed longer in order to visit the spa again! Wouldn't change a thing."

He felt as tho he went to another planet because the treatments were so amazing and I agree with him. It was one of the best treatments I've ever had in my life and I know my treatments. I definitely recommend this spa. The prices are great and it is very professional service where the girls actually take their time on you instead on rushing you in and out. That's the problem I run into at most spas is that they rush you through the services but not this spa! The girls are wonderful! This is a must!"

On my recent stay at the Borei Agkor Resort & Spa and thanks to the recommendation of Chan Sophea, I booked a treatment at the Mudita Spa, which is part of this establishment. When I walked in to the Mudita Spa, (must admit I was a little hesitant at first), I found it to be an oasis of calm and serenity that I didn\u2019t expect to find in Siem Reap. The premises were so clean and the staff were extremely welcoming, which added to the serene atmosphere of the Spa facilitates making this a very calming place to be.The staff are absolutely fabulous and very professional in taking care of you and making you feel welcome and relaxed.The smells were just beautiful and this started to relax me straight away. The traditional Khmer massage I had using their exclusive herbal steam therapy, left my body and myself feeling relaxed and renewed indeed.Thanks Chan Sophea once again for the recommendation. I highly recommend a Khmer Massage and treatment and will be definitely making us of the Spa on my next trip. The Mudita Spa it\u2019s certainly on my to do list. The Resort was great as well and the staff were just so helpful."

We then slowly made our way into the couple's massage room, which smelled divine. The massage itself was just what each of us wanted. I asked for a bit more pressure and my boyfriend asked for less and the ladies happily took that direction to tailor the experience. We finished off with some sweet fresh ginger tea and walked out beaming. Exactly what we needed after the 28 hour journey to Cambodia."

Alex was very friendly and kind to help us book the spa. Borei Angkor is a great hotel with so many fun and helpful staff. I will definitely stay at this hotel again if I come visit Siem Reap in the future."

PHEN was a phenomenal massage therapist, the very best ...so knowledgeable and so sweet. I encourage anyone to go to the Mudita Spa and request her services. The use of the hot herbal compress on my body was an unique and healing experience, incredible effect on my muscles, complete relaxation. I just wish i can get another massage right now."

Their swedish massage is so relaxing.There is free cool towel, cool drink. An individual room with English speaking masseurs. Cool air con. Individual toilet. Every where so clean. And they keep checking how is their pressure it is ok. Outside massage is not cheaper for same or less than service. And they good promotion from time to time 30 for 85min.

We had the Khmer massage which is a local style that uses hot towels. Very relaxing and therapeutic. We also had the abdominal treatment. This is not for everyone, but if you have something in your abdomen that you want to have worked on they did a very thorough treatment that both of us noticed benefits. They have periodical specials at the spa so make sure that you check with Kolap and see if there is anything that interests you. Also make sure that you arrived early for your treatment as they have very nice sauna and hot tub to be able to loosen up your muscles. Highly recommended!"

We arrived early to enjoy the steam, sauna and hot and cold jacuzzis but as soon as i entered the female dressing room, I was disappointed to see that it is not maintained in tip top condition as I would expect a 5-star spa. I skipped the jacuzzi when I saw all the tile grime, doorknobs where disintegrating and there where mosquitoes and flies inside the airconditioned women's locker. Not relaxing at all. Decided to give the spa a chance and proceeded with both our spa packages which included body scrub, mud masque and massage. Scrub and masque left much to be desired. Attendants would noisily wash the basins in the treatment room and it would destroy continuity of treatment. Before taking the shower to clean the masque off, I asked the attendant where my slippers was, and she removed hers. Apparently she used the slippers i brought up from the room!!! Only good thing was the excellent massage I got from Tien. If you decide to try mudita, skip everything else and just book a massage with her."

If not someone who gets massaged a lot (like me) then just be aware the ladies are strong and really work your muscles, and unlike my previous experiences they massage the stomach area. Was a great massage and definitely felt a lot better after it. Would recommend paying them a visit."

The pedicure was very basic, not as good as the states at all they charged $3.00 for nail polish which was absurd. Overall I would say keep looking in the area as there are better values for your money."

From the moment I walked through the door the whole experience was first class. Very friendly and professional staff, I have travelled the world and had more than a thousand massages ! This place is as good as it gets and absolutely brilliant value for money. The traditional massage without oil was the best I have ever had and the four hands massage was an experience everyone should experience at least once. My wife and many friends who also visited Coolsense agreed it was a first class experience. If you are in Siem Reap it is a must do ! Make sure you to pay Coolsense a visit you will not regret it.David, NewZealand"

The front entrance could be better lit or if there was at least a warning sign would have been helpful as I ended up cutting myself at the bottom of my foot.The place inside was clean, and the receptionist who saw me fall looked at my apologetically. I smiled and told her I was \"okay\" asked for a foot massage. She assigned me a young girl who began washing my feet and asked me to change into a pair of slippers. I was lead to a small area with about 4-5 vacant chairs and she began to work on my feet. The massage started off well, but halfway through the massage, she started using only 1-hand. I realized she was texting back and forth for a few minutes on her phone. Later on she got a phone call and answered it as well. She even started a conversation with another person outside the room which was a bit odd. At the end of the massage, the young lady stood nearby and expectingly waited for a tip. I decided to give her a $1 and she thanked me and immediately disappeared into the back hallways.Normally, I would not have tipped due to the unprofessional service, but the massage was actually decent when the young lady was not \"distracted\" and vastly superior to the hotel massage I got the day before. Perhaps next time, I should lower my standards for service/professionalism during my next visit to a SPA"

All I could do was just enjoy and relax. I was so happy after that. I wish all my spa experiences would be like that.

He had a regular massage and I got the four hands massage and a pedicure. It was definitely not a professional four hands massage in which two masseuses are supposed to synchronize their movements. Both women talked and giggled during the entire massage which I found very distracting. I had to ask them multiple times to go softer, to which they would giggle outrageously. On the pedicure, they soaked my feet in water then changed the polish but didn't slough off any dead skin or massage my feet. I saw no evidence that the tools were cleaned or disinfected between use, so I asked them not to cut my cuticles. The woman who did the polish wasn't pleased with her work, so she kept wiping it off and restarting, which got quite annoying after the third time she did it. My toes still look like I painted them myself. I'm not actually much of a complainer, but felt I should offer my experience, as it differed drastically from the many 5-star reviews posted here."

The massage was good, the woman who massaged me found plenty of tender spots but also knew how to release the muscles around them. Before and after the staff were attentive to our needs, washed our feet and even redid my hair (which was in a ponytail prior to the massage). lovely cold water and plenty of tea were a good addition, and the staff were smiling the whole time. They obviously enjoy the environment, and tried to speak English clearly and carefully."

I got their 1hour massage (USD12 for 60 minutes), which was awesome. They give you a cold towel to cool off before you have your massage. And you also get a cup of hot tea after.

We were surprised at how reasonable the prices were compared to the more 'dodgy' or not so nice joints that are common in Siam Reap, seeing as how nice it was. The interior decor, smells and extremely peaceful and relaxing ambience, not to mention the very professional and competent staff really made this place stand out. This is a legit place and if your looking for a great and professional massage service I would say its worth paying the extra dollar or so for. I got a foot reflexology massage and couldn't ask anything more from it, great massage, and the extras such as the towels, tea and water that they serve that not many other places would bend their backs to provide was a great find."

Having seen the other reviews on Trip Advisor for CoolSense Spa, albeit there weren't many of them, we thought we'd check it out.The lady at the desk provided a warm welcome and a drink each on arrival and spoke very good English, encouraging us prior to our booking the massages, by saying we could review them on Trip Advisor...so far so good we thought.We had a massage together in their room with 2 massage tables in it. I opted for the Coolsense 4 hand Energizer massage and my wife for the Coolsense Relax massage. One of the ladies doing my massage (the slightly older, larger built lady) was much better than the other and seemed reasonably good overall, so if I'd opted for the Relax treatment, perhaps she'd have provided a good massage. However, in combination with the other lady, it felt confused at times with contradictory massages applied at the same time (i.e. a relaxing back massage from the better lady, whilst the other seemed to be very firmly grabbing at my leg one handed - an attempt at acupressure perhaps?!), making me uncomfortable and looking forward to the massage finishing. Additionally, the pillow that was placed under my head for the second part of the massage, had what appeared to be mould/damp stains on it and no cover was put on this pillow to cover it! In fact, I spent the first part of the massage looking down through the face-hole at the pillow, which was underneath the table, hoping that they'd be covering it before placing it under my head. Unfortunately they didn't!The young lady massaging my wife had her mobile phone on in the treatment room, switched to vibrate, which was easy to hear when she was texted, called and had a message left for her, after she'd sent a call to voicemail, each time interrupting my wife's massage. Both of us found this really unprofessional and it contributed significantly to our poor overall experience here. My wife also found that for parts of her massage, that she was receiving a one handed treatment, leading us to wonder afterwards if the young lady was actually texting during the session. The young lady was clearly tired and yawning on and off throughout and scratched her head a lot throughout the session, making my wife feel even more uncomfortable. She also wore lots of bangles on her wrist, which constantly jangled, again detracting from what should have been a relaxing experience.With us laying face down at the start and having our eyes covered when we turned over, we didn't fully appreciate that neither of us was receiving a good massage until afterwards, despite me obviously noticing the mobile phone going off. In the future we'll have code words for 'I'm not enjoying this, let's stop and go!'.On a more positive note, we were able to have a handheld shower before and after the session.I tried carefully to explain to the lady at the desk about the mobile phone issue when I went to pay and despite her good English, she didn't seem to understand what I meant at all, until the young lady whose phone it was, apparently explained it to her, whilst clearly not being happy that I was mentioning it. The lady at the desk was unapologetic and didn't seem to understand why I was telling her about it, so very frustratedly, I put it down to a bad experience, paid and we noted down the details for the Trip Advisor review we'd been invited to leave. Albeit not overly expensive at around $50 for us both for 1.5 hours, we wished we'd spent a bit more and had a much better massage elsewhere. This was the only one of 5 massages we had in Cambodia and Vietnam that wasn't very good. Perhaps we were unlucky and visited on a bad day for them, but we wouldn't go back here again and it was the only service we didn't tip for throughout our whole trip."

Tey was awesome. I am American, living in Thailand and no one there knows how to do a good strong oil massage. I guess I have to come to Cambodia to make it happen. Tey was wonderful. One of the best massages ever (and I get them a lot).Other benefits include a nice clean shower for washing off before (so as to be a polite customer) and after. Sweet staff, good prices and very nice place."

My friends had back massages and they were also very happy with their back rub.The second day I came back for a manicure and pedicure which were done with care - at one point I think I had 4 therapists doing my nails! (They didn't have other customers at the time I suppose). The manager was very friendly and attentive and spoke good English, whereas the therapists weren't so fluent with English. It didn't matter though as the manager was always at hand to translate."

I found this place by chance, it is easy to walk passed the door on Sivutha St, there are no ladies outside saying \"massage, massage\"! as pushing phamphlets into your hand...... which I appreciated. This place has class, and I was looking for class without the hefty price you pay in the 5 star hotels here. I found it at CoolSense Spa. A perfumed wet cloth and tea are given on arrival. I chose the 4 hands massage and was not disappointed, being a trained massage therapist myself, these girls knew what they were doing and gave me an excellent massage, I could choose the pressure I wanted and as I like firm pressure I received exactly what I wanted. The place is very clean and airconditioned but not cold. I was in heaven. $20 for a one hour 4 hand massage was worth every penny. I could have gone around the corner into busy Pub Street area and received one for $15-$18 but this was well worth the extra $2-3. I say pay the extra and receive quality. Try the 4 hands, it is amazing. They also give facials, body scrubs, etc. Which I am sure would be just as professional as the massages."

Had tried 4 massages in Siem Reap and this is the best, with the well trained masseurs providing a solid relief from the tiring day out walking in Angkor Wat. Do remember to ask for a STRONG massage though, as my experience with Cambodian massage is that they tend to be too soft.For the great massage, the prices are very reasonable. I did 1.5 hrs of 4 hand massage and it cost me only USD $30."

While you are choosing your service they bring you an aromatic ice cold towel and tea. Once you choose your service they scrub your feet and afterwards you can relax with tea and a treat. Great atmosphere and every massage has been a quality one here. I live in siem reap so I've been to many spas but I can only say good things about this place!"

The receptionist whom we met when we popped into the spa after dinner at Lilypop restaurant (3 mins walk) the night before came with a tuk tuk to pick us up. Great service. Did a couple 3-hours spa treatment. Given a cold drink to start with followed by a scrub of the feet. Was given a couple room with 2 beds. The room is clean and the atmopshere was superb with dimmed lights and background pipe in music. Put you in a very relaxing mood. The atmosphere here is much better than those massage shops at Pub Street. Started with back massage with oil, followed by a body scrub and finally the facial massage. The massage was great after all the walking visiting Angkor Wat. We finished the massage abt 11pm, their closing time and we are the last customers. After the massage, we have another cold drink and fresh fruits. Great way to end a massage. Price per pax abt $50 for the 3 hours massage after 15% discount. Great value and highly recommended."

I must say this must be the BEST found out of the 3 other spas I went!!I booked this place few days in advance and they notified me they could arrange a pick up from our hotel or anywhere we were at SiemReap. From the moment they picked us up...to...their greetings with their warm smile at the door when we arrived, we felt very welcomed and comfortable. My party and I chose the traditional Khmer massage and foot reflexology. The spa experience was very relaxing!! We didn't expect with this great hospitality service and excellent massage treatment, the price was VERY reasonable! In the end of the night, they even offered us a free tuk-tuk ride back to our hotel. I just can't say enough how great this spa place is. I will definitely come back if I visit Siem Reap again and recommend this place to my friends, family and you all! :)"

I normally hate people touching me, especially my neck, but after 3 hours of horse riding I needed my sore muscles worked on. Not feeling well, I collapsed onto the massage table and was worked on by a lovely lady. To my expectations, I was a little tender on my back and neck and didn't particularly like that done, but the lady I had was very accommodating and once she became aware of my discomfort she started to kneed very gently and from then on it became a pleasurable experience :) I loved having my legs and arms massaged - legs being the most sore from horse riding so I was very grateful for that. E teas and biscuit I got before and after the massage was great as well. Staff were very professional and accommodating... As soon as the massage was finished I wanted another one. Will definitely go back the next time I'm in Siem reap :)"

It was very relaxing but still firm and my muscles and joints feel nice and loose now. I then stayed for a spa pedicure ($20 for 65 mins) - very professional and thorough, including cuticle trim, foot and leg soak and massage, dead skin removal and polish with bottom and top coat. I was given hot tea to drink during the pedicure which was a nice touch.A very positive experience with a few minor negatives (pedicure area could do with a lick of paint; staff's level of English very basic, so if you had specific requirements it may be worth asking for an English speaking therapist).Nevertheless this spa is clean, professional and reasonably priced.

Then flipped over on to my back, where she did my legs, feet, arms, hands. She didn't do my torso - maybe she saw my lack-of-6-pack and didn't see the point. (Actually, my wife had the same and they didn't do hers either - so it's probably not included in the massage.)Finishing with the neck, head, and a polite goodbye.

Despite being next to the live music, the massage room was quiet and the room was air conditioned. The spa itself was very well kept and the inside was very nice. The massage unfortunately was mediocre at best. I opted for the head/shoulder/back massage and I just didn't feel a very good flow with the masseuse. It was as if she was just aimlessly rubbing random areas on my back rather than focus on specific areas. The massage also kept jumping from feeling really good to feeling really painful. The table was just a bed with a thin cushion. My face would hurt every time the masseuse would increase pressure as my face was pressing against the small hole in the bed. My girlfriend had the same discomfort as well. During my massage my masseuse just got up and left for 5 minutes. Not sure why but that killed the experience for me. At the end when I tried to tip her, I found out that she bolted as soon as he massage was over. I get that the employees work long, hard hours; however, we never had any trouble with service at any of the other places we visited. Prices were mid range: $20 for mine and $18 for my girlfriend's khmer massage. "

I would highly recommend the one in central market area (15 mins walk from pub street, but they can arrange tuk tuk to pick you up). I was staying in central angkor boutique hotel, so its very easy to reach the one located in central market area. (Central angkor boutique hotel is the best one that i would recommend to all of the travelled too. Reasonable price, good location and the BEST staffs)I tried Aroma oil massage, hot stone massage and deep relax massage. The best i like is deep relax massage > aroma oil massage > hot stone massage. If you like massage with strong and deep power, then definitely need to try deep relax massage, it will set your body free (totally !) after a long walk temple visit day! They are having promotion with 20% off, but somehow dont know why the branch in old market area only gave me 15% by saying the hot stone massage is not the one included in 20% list (they should have told me in beginning though, because i double checked with them if they had discount of 20% when i walked into their shop). Anyways it is absolutely relaxing to have massage here after walking the whole day!"

I am in Siem Reap for a while and need to have a massage therapist that actually feels the muscles and follows a process, does not chat on the phone and giggle, and does listen to your needs.And i have FOUND it here, just around the corner from where I am staying, how lucky!I get a lot of hip and back pain so needed someone properly trained.They are not the cheapest massage, but certainly not the dearest, still only 1/6th of the price I would be paying at home in Australia, very clean and hygienic and set out to western standards with proper massage beds.The person who was winging about not speaking english should sharpen there Khmer skills, these ladies really try hard, who's country are they visiting anyway. Chill!"

We filled out a form to let them know our massage preferences. We were given tea, water, and fruits. They washed our feet prior to the massage. Then we were taken to a private room ( which had AC) on the second floor. The therapists did not speak English but the receptionist had explained to them what we wanted. They have a second location about 2 km away from the pub street location. The sign for the spa is not very visible, so walk slowing once you get to Pub street. The spa is right where Pub street begins. They also offer a 20% discount if you inquire about it. Overall, this place offers a great value, a very good massage, excellent prices, and a clean facility. We would definitely go back when visiting Seam Reap."

The service staff are friendly and caring and the ambiance is relaxing from start to finish. I think this spa is under-rated as it really should be getting a lot more reviews on here! I decided to experiment today with another spa that is getting great ratings on Trip Advisor and it was NOTHING compared to Devatara in any way. You may pay a few USD more here, but it's still super inexpensive compared to other countries. I'd easily be paying upwards of $130 for what I received at Devatara for $20. The facial was also excellent!"

My wife had earlier in the day had a cheap massage on pub Street which left her in pain. We decided on seeing the spa to go in and see if they could repair the damage done earlier in the day by the cheap Street massage. On entry we were warmly greeted by a lovely friendly receptionist. We explained what my wife needed and I requested while i was there if i could get my legs done. With in minutes we were having our feet gently washed and taken to the massage room. Amazing would be an understatement! Relaxing, quiet, and friendly. The lady massaging my wife found the area the earlier massage had caused damage to and started to work on it. At the end of the fantastic massage, my wife had no pain at all. The service is worth every single cent and I wish we had found it earlier and not on our last night in Siem Reap. If you want a truly outstanding spa and treatment, you Must go here! Ignore the cheap Street massages and pay a little more and know you're in good hands. Thank you once again for excellent service."

We were so happy with the service that we returned every single day after our first visit! It was well priced and they offered a wide range of services. We even received a 20% discount on some of the treatments! The customer service is fantastic and the premises are very clean and well kept. I immensely enjoyed my salt scrub, four hand massage, pedicure, foot reflexology and traditional Khmer massage however one thing that did disappoint me was that the therapists whispered to each other and giggled continuously throughout the massage. This ruined the ambience for me, but aside from this it was a worthwhile experience."

When you walk down the street in Siem Reap it can be hard to tell the basic massage spas from the special ones. we walked past Devatara on the Main Street and could make out if it was as nice as we were hoping. Checked out tripadvisor and their website and decided to give them a go. So pleased I did!I made a phone booking which was a little difficult as the English was very basic, but they offered to collect me from my hotel and 10 minutes later I was in tuk tuk with the very friendly receptionist Dara. When I arrived he brought me inside to sit relax and have a cold tea before my treatment.The inside of the spa is very nice, there are wicker seats with cushions in them that are really nice, then they take you behind the curtain to reclining chair to have a foot bath. From there it was upstairs to nice private room with nice ambient music. I had the 'secret of asia beauty' package. massage and then coconut body scrub. The massage was beautiful and relaxing and the coconut scrub divine, there was a nice clean shower to use after the scrub. fter the treatment there was another up of tea and some fresh fruit. It was a lovely experience and am now trying to work out how I can fit in another visit before I leave Siem Reap in the morning."

If you want very good massages at Siam Reap, you need to go to the Devatara Spa, near the old market (they have 3 spas in Siam Reap). We got 2 back and shoulders treatments with Kanha and Miss Orn, and I have to say that for the price (12$) you got the best value in town, compare to Bodia which is a bite more exclusive and twice more expensive. I just checked the prices, without doing any treatment there. Beside this, and I give some importance to that, the therapist do not speak during the treatment. You really can enjoy it. It's very clean, it smells very nice, and they are very nice and keen to give their best."

I had a $8 massage at Islands a few doors down the night before my stop at Devatara and I left feeling unsatisfied from that experience. For a few dollars more, you can have a decent aromatherapy massage at Devatara. The facility was nice and clean, smelled great, and they gave you tea and cookies as you waited (before and after your treatment). I had a pedicure to clean up my traveler's feet and they had a decent range of OPI colors. Also, the lady did a pretty thorough job at tending to my toes. For my comfort aromatherapy, they used decent oils but I still didn't think my masseuse used enough pressure (this one was supposed to more of a deep tissue massage). Ah well! I've had my fair share of massages so I'm just really picky when it comes to these things. I still found it relaxing and the staff were really nice. There is a shower where you can rinse off before and afterwards but I skipped it since I was just heading home afterwards.Also, one staff person (named Ata) was especially nice and gave me some free Cambodian snacks to take home with me...free of charge! Unlike other places that really push for services, the staff here are very chill and friendly. Nice place to visit especially a day after trekking through the temples =)"

I had a one-hour back, neck and head massage ($12), followed by a one-hour foot massage ($8). It was fantastic! I understand perhaps street foot massages may be even cheaper, but I didn't care, because the prices were already such a deal. The environment is very quiet and soothing. The masseur was very good, and especially good with working the muscles in my hands and feet (I wish I knew her name). No appointment was needed. The spa was very clean, and even had a small shower int he back to wash off extra oils (if you're like me and don't want to be too oiley).

The therapist who was assigned to me had been working there for five months.1. The manicure was average at best, the spa bit was a scrub applied up to beyond the wrists with scrub washed away with lotus petal and lime infused water. The hand massage was poorly executed. No base coat/strengthener was applied to the nails; received 2 coats of Opi colour followed by a top coat. The nails weren't soaked at any point before or after trimming and cuticle removal was not well-done. 2. The put me in a room which didn't have a tap/wash basin so the therapist had to leave the room to get clean water. The standard of hygiene was low because she had to open and close doors, carry a little basin of water then touched my face. She filed my nails while I had mask on my face and after that, without washing her hands she proceeded to remove the peel mask. I am used to a high hygiene standard for both facials and massages. So unless you are very sticky about cleanliness and hygiene like me, this spa is ok."

We both got a full body aromatherapy massages for $14 for 60mins. The therapist I had was called 'Makara' and she was fabulous, it is one of the best massages I've ever had. The staff are very professional, the premises are somewhat quirky upstairs, but ambient. In comparison with many of the Hotels offering spas at twice/three times the price, this place is value for money.Tip: there is a laundry next door to this Spa, we didn't get to use it, but a great option to get clothes washed, rather than the usual expensive Hotel laundry costs ; )"

I had a back, neck and head massage earlier this week and it was fantastic. 60 minutes for only $12 is a bargain in my opinion and I would rather pay a few extra dollars than go to the street massages. It's a really lovely spa and I would highly recommend it. I would go as far to say that it's the best massage I've ever had!"

I guess I was never impressed with the massages to begin with, but I went a 2nd time for another go at it. The staff were not overly friendly, and one young woman in particular had mastered the death stare. She clearly did not want to be working there. Overall I have been here 3 times.The second visit I requested a head, neck, shoulder massage, but when the masseuse started massaging my legs I had to remind her of my request. Apparently massaging the legs is now part of a head, neck, should massage now! Neither massage was very soothing or beneficial. Clearly the young woman had no training in proper techniques. I enjoyed the pedicure and foot scrub. It was really quite soothing. However, when I went back for another one, there was no foot wash upon my arrival. When I was lead upstairs to the \"room\" it was a dimly lit massage room with two tables where I was instructed to sit. Ummm...how does one get a proper foot scrub with your legs dangling off of a massage table in the near dark? Apparently the one room for pedicures was occupied. I walked right out the front door, after negotiating the very narrow hallways, doorways and cramped staircase.If you can't provide the services requested, then let the customer know rather than provide sub-par services. They've lost my future business."

I instantly met the owner of the spa who was interested in making my experience the best it could be. I got a pedicure and a swedish oil massage. Both were wonderful. The woman who did my pedicure spent loads of time washing and scrubbing down my worn, traveler's feet! The oil massage was relaxing and professional. I had also chosen to get my eyebrows waxed. Unfortunately, this part of the experience was not great. There were still many stray hairs left behind. I also did not like their choice of wax. Overall, I had a very good experience!"

            "review": "Terrible experience. The massage \"therapist\" scratched me with her nails and sat on me.. This is my first review ever on Tripadvisor (or any other websites) because I must tell the story and advise people not to go. It is a bit long and if you want a quick one, just read paragraph #5, 8, 9. It was our last day in Siem Reap on 28 Jul 2012 and we really wanted a relaxing afternoon. We had a very very nice spa experience in Nha Trang, Vietnam just 5 days ago so we expected that we could find similar standard of service here in Siem Reap.We chose this place because the shop front looked neat and they had a nice little booklet listing their services and prices, with a slip saying \"Rate us on Tripadvisor\". So we thought with such a confidence it couldn't be bad. We also read a few reviews on Tripadvisor before we went in.When we went inside, the staff wasn't really very enthusiastic and one girl was arranging flowers with her earphones on, without even looking at us. The welcome tea was just ordinary tea, not the herbal tea you would expect in a spa facility. They gave us a foot wash, with lemon slices and flower petals in the water but they helped each of us one at a time and i suspected that they reused the water. #5Right after that, they told us that the rooms were full and they could arrange a tuk tuk to take us to another shop. The shop was listed on the booklet and name card so we thought it was ok. Obviously we were not alert enough that this was the beginning of a 'scam'.We took a tuk tuk for about 2 minutes and arrived at the other shop. It looked not as neat but we thought it's the service that matters. Then we were led to a very small room, with two bed side by side, actually leaving no room for the therapist to stand around. We asked whether we could take a shower first and they said we shouldn't take a shower now, but afterward. We already felt a bit awkward because I chose a Swedish massage meaning oil would be applied. They said they would wipe us with a clean towel. I went to the washroom before the treatment. It was shabby. And the shower next to it too. I am 5'3\" and I was sure my head would nearly touch the 'ceiling' if i stood inside. Maybe that's why they didn't want us take a shower because we could have left when we saw the shower. #8So as they had said they would wipe us clean with a towel but the girl just wipe my upper back casually for a few times. When the treatment started, I felt uncomfortable immediately. The pushing and the \"stroke\" were not right. It was not only uncomfortable but you knew the girl didn't know what it meant by massage. And I felt her nail with her every movement. And the most horrible feeling was that she sat on me right from the start and I could totally feel her bottom 'rubbing' on my lower back! It felt bad and at one point I couldn't bear anymore and said \"your nails!\". She immediately showed me her nails just 2 inches away from my face like in the manner of a protest. I thought \"Ok you keep short nails but with the wrong kind of push you keep scratching me.\" #9I just stopped the 'massage' and asked my friend how she felt. This was when I saw the girl who was doing massage for her wore black nail polish, which I guess wasn't something you would expect from a massage therapist? My friend was quite experienced in different kinds of massage and she said it was very uncomfortable too. (later on, she told me she seldom cut short a session or requested a change of therapist even though it was not the most comfortable but this time it made her feel unbearable.) Immediately we decided to cut short the session. At first, we thought we let them start and couldn't just leave without paying so I asked if we could just change from 90 min to 30 min. The receptionist came in and we started the negotiation. But she kept asking us to keep a 60 min session. We refused and we both agreed that even 1 more minute was unbearably uncomfortable. So I offered to give them some money and we would leave immediately. After some negotiation, we insisted leaving so they just left the room and let us put our clothes back on. When we left the room we gave them the money and left immediately. The receptionist tried to negotiate further but we just left. We had the 'treatment' (more like punishment) for just less than 3 min and we thought the money we gave was good enough to 'compensate' for what 'services' they had offered. If we had been more alert, we could have avoided such a bad experience right when they said the rooms were full and we needed to change place. If the rooms were full already they shouldn't even offer us the foot wash and tea at that shop. I have no idea why they had the confidence to ask people to rate them on Tripadvisor and why there are so many positive reviews here. Were we just unlucky or they select people and offer difference services to different people?"

I had the Apsara massage and the Reflexology massage and both were very relaxing.They seem to use quality products, the staff are properly trained and you get some fruit or dried ginger and a cup of tea at the end which is always a nice touch.

The people were polite, but sometimes they would talk during our session. This made me feel a bit uncomfortable because i was expecting a peaceful environment, and i couldn't help feeling like they were talking about us -- not good when you're lying face down in just a towel and undies! I also didn't get much \"aroma\" from my aromatherapy; the oil they used was unscented and not the jasmine one i had picked. Otherwise, I found the experience enjoyable. My tired muscles felt much more relaxed afterwards.More tea after. They also allowed us to pay in euros. 1 hour aromatherapy & 1 hour swedish massage, $14 each = $28 or 25 euros including tips"

The massage is a whole body massage, and I didn't feel \"expert hands\" concentrating on tired muscles (in which some experts could actually feel the twisted muscles and work on it). Once we finished off the massage, we had the full-body scrub. When it comes to finishing off, we were to shower off the scrub particles from our body. That's where I felt a bit of despair.. The bathroom with toilet in it has tissues in the toilet bowl, in which I think should be cleared off by the spa attendant before another customer goes in. I had to ask her to flush it for me. It could help if they could fix the shower since it rained so slow. And it doesn't hurt to invest in proper shower gels for the customer too. The price is reasonable.

It is way better than the cheap 5-10 dollar massages I tried at other places, (the ones with dingy decor and smelly mattresses). U pay peanuts u get peanuts. Infact I went to a real classy luxuriously overpriced establishment (Bodiaa Spa) the day before but they failed to make me fall asleep. Massage strokes was too fast at Bodiaa to induce anyone to sleep so I went home with a huge dissapointment and 45 dollar poorer.Devatara is now are offering a 15% off promotion (check their website) so a one hour massage that costs 12-14 dollars will be even cheaper. Their staff is very courteous & attentive too.I will definitely return!"

This is a step up from the cheap places nearby but is not much more expensive, about $9 for an oil massage for 1 hour, also you have a foot wash on arrival and they do spa treatments and various massages like Indian head, Swedish and Thai. I had the Swedish one which was pretty hard but good and next day I had a aromatherapy massage. The girls are nice and seem well trained. I met an Australian woman who did massage and she said they were the best she had had in Siem Reap."

It started out well with the staff bringing us some tea while they got the things ready. The water they bought out to soak our feet was cold and that was just the beginning. The colour range was small and on top of that the nail varnishes were old and dried up. Instead of telling us they continue to use it and insisted it was going to turn out nice. During my cuticle treatment the woman cut my cuticles THREE times. After the first time I told her it was okay and she could slow down and take her time however she continued to trim quickly (even though there was no one else waiting). As for the pedicure there was no scrubbing of the feet which we expected especially for the price. The coverage of both my hands and feet and my friend's feet were uneven. Due to the old and dried up nail polish the result was blotchy. When we went to pay I told the owner that one of the staff members cut my fingers on more than one occasion and I had to shove my bloody finger in her face before she believed me. Instead of offering me a discount I had to explain to her I wasn't going to pay full price, only then she asked me to pay $12 USD instead of $15 USD (for a mani pedi). Which was still too high in retrospect. Then she offered my friend $5 USD instead of $10 USD for her bad pedicure. All in all, I would RECOMMEND EVERYONE TO STAY AWAY. Very expensive for Cambodia and the service was HORRENDOUS (and the manicure lasted less than a week)."

When we sat on the waiting area sofa, dust blew up from the cushions. The rooms while air conditioned were really low end and nothing like a spa. The toilets are even worse with a bathtub with a really dirty shower curtain. The masseuses were very inexperienced and the massage was the equivalent of just rubbing oil with no technique whatsoever. All this would be fine if the prices were not equivalent to a number of far superior spas that we went to on our trip. A complete waste of time and money. The staff were very polite though and so it was a real pity."

The second time, I bought a 10 massages for $100 card. The third time I went in, just after 10am (Luck Nuvo opens at 10am), I was told by the lady at the front counter I would have to come back, as they had no staff until 1pm. Why would they open their spa at 10am, if they had no staff? I told the lady I couldn't come back, as I was busy, and I wanted a refund. She told me that people holding this card needed to make an appointment, but when she sold me the card, she didn't tell me that. She then blamed her manager. I asked to speak to the manager. While we were waiting (keeping in mind, I had not raised my voice this whole time), the front counter lady said to me, \"This is a small problem but you make big problem from it.\" I was appalled at how she spoke to me. When the manager came down, I explained this to her, and the front counter lady said in front of me, \"This lady get very very angry with small problem.\". Again I was horrified with the service. The manager gave me my money back, however I am not really sure if she understood the problem with the service. I would not recommend this place, as you can get cheaper massages with better service just a few doors down. That is where my money is going now."

We had a short walk around the garden and were then taken to a lovely airconditioned room for our soap making, where we made ten little soaps, after which we had relaxing foot massages. It was explained to us that the girls were learning English and the art of massage and I am pleased to say they did a great job. When our massages were finished we were presented with our soaps, all nicely packaged to take home as small gifts or souvenirs. There is a shop where you can purchase lovely hand creams and essential oils.For a small extra fee were driven right back to our accommodation.

If we were taken aback by the price at first (USD rates for Malaysians can sometimes be steep), it all became worthwhile by the end of it. We went with the 2-hour treatment that included a Khmer traditional steam sauna 'chupong', massage and scrub that is customized according to your body condition. We were treated to refreshing drink before and after the session. The masseuses were professional, the massage room was spacious and very clean. The area surrounding Spa Khmer is so inviting and relaxing, it makes you want to live there and never leave. Spa Khmer to me is like a warm chocolate lava cake on a cold, rainy day.

We sat down and they gave us a cup of ginger tea and we selected aromatherapy massage with oil. We got a choice of oils which was lovely. We picked what we wanted and they gave us a few minutes to finish our tea before taking us in to a middle room to wash our legs and feet. The massage was really lovely. My partner and I were in the same room, both therapists checked in that the pressure was ok and it was. We were served with a cup of tea afterwards as well and again the service was lovely.The massage itself was decent, what you'd expect for the pricing but the service was great. Because of this we went back yesterday. Very different experience.We decided on the same massage as it was relaxing last time. They didn't give us oils to choose from, I figured maybe we would pick when in the room. We were served tea but instantly ushered in to the room for the foot and leg wash down by the manager who walked around swinging keys and didn't seem too interested. I rushed a sip then did what we were told.In the massage room same process really, my partner was in the same room. They started on the massage. There was no picking oil aroma this time.My partners therapist asked if he was ok. Mine didn't. She then put so much oil on my back and then was just wiping up and down. I asked politely if she could increase her pressure. She said yes. It didn't happen.I asked a total of five times for her to press harder. This then translated in to her jamming her elbows in to my back with no real control. Also there was so much oil on me it would have been hard to control!It was very clear she didn't know what she was doing or rather, had any form of training (again I have managed expectations based on where we're traveling. But this was very different to the last experience!)So I gave up. I just tried to enjoy what was left of the massage. Sometimes shed remember to press harder then clearly forget and I'm not sure what she was even doing. I just smiled and said thank you at the end. My husband said his therapist was great! Maybe I had the trainee? Not sure.So, for $22 the first massage was decent. The service was really lovely and the place was clean. The second experience was just poor. Hence the average rating. "

It does lack the luxury of the higher end spas, but you are not paying for that either.We went twice in a five day trip. The first time I had a massage and body scrub for $40 for about two hours. The therapist was very strong and I had some bruises the following day. I usually ask for medium pressure but perhaps light would have been better under her (very) capable hands! The bathroom facilities for showering after the scrub were basic but clean although the toilet was very close to the shower which I was not a big fan of\u2026 The following visit both Mr PH and I attended. I had a mani and pedi in the \u2018group\u2019 foot massage room - two therapists worked on me. The pedi was very well done. The mani less so but still decent value for money. Mr PH enjoyed his head/shoulder/neck massage and said the therapist was very strong. Total price for both of us was USD $31.00.Overall I can recommend this place for a cheap and cheerful treatment - just remember you are not paying Park Hyatt prices so do not expect the bells and whistles!"

Laying on the bed you could smell the freshly washed towels. I had the 90 min aromatherapy massage and had a choice of 4 oils, I chose lemongrass as I thought was appropriate. The techniques and balance in the massage was amazing. She was careful and caring. On completion we were given a hot Beal tea which was a lovely finish to the incredible massage. I returned 2 days later but was disappointed to find the girl I had was on a later shift so I went with another called Alin 2 . I don't know how but I think she was a tad better if that is possible. I had 120 minutes of pure heaven as it was the best massage I have had in the two and a half months in Vietnam and Cambodia. I highly recommend you give it a try and ask for this girl."

We each did the 90 minute Khmer massage, and loved it, especially in comparison to massages I've had in the US. The masseuse starts by washing and scrubbing your feet, then you head to the room. There, you change into light cotton shorts and a tunic (a nice, modest alternative to my previous experiences), and then she massages you from your feet to your scalp. It's strong, without being painful, and it's a great combination of massaging and stretching. It felt like the masseuse could tell what was tight, so she would stretch the muscle first, before working it further. The environment was calming and we really enjoyed our massages at lemongrass - highly recommended!"

I read a review someone posted re lemongrass indicating it was expensive. Let me address that claim. Is it more money than any massage you can get in the night market - yes but in the night market your $2 massage is actually only for 10 mins. And it's in a store front parlour and who knows if the people giving the massage actually know what they are doing. At lemongrass it is a lovely spa. The ladies are knowledgable and you can get a 1 hour massage in a classy place for $12. Do the math. Not expensive. But I got the 3 hour package with various services for $62. A steal if you ask me. And you must try the four hands massage. Two people massage you at the same time. Heaven! Totally appropriate and I always felt safe and comfortable. Do remember to tip the ladies. They earned it."

This business has 2 locations; I went to the one at 105B Sivatha Blvd and bought a custom package (20% off) comprising a facial, foot scrub and leg massage that easily costs 4 times as much back home. I highly recommend the therapist Ms Leap, who was thoroughly conscientious and professional in her work. Each treatment was done with full attention to the smallest details and Ms Leap regularly checked that I was comfortable with the massage intensity, as some parts of the treatment were quite vigorous. She took pains to ensure a relaxing environment i.e. monitoring room temperature, addressing colleagues who were talking loudly next door and asking a handyman to work more quietly while he was hammering away in another room. The fact that Ms Leap did this without any prompting from me is a clear indication that she cares about her clients' comfort and takes the initiative in providing top-notch customer service, which I sincerely hope will be recognised and rewarded by her employers. Staff like Ms Leap are the crowning asset of Lemongrass Garden, even more so than its clean premises, attractive d\u00e9cor and wide range of affordable luxurious treatments. Honourable mention must also go to the refreshing complimentary teas (offered before and after treatments) and serene background music that accompanies the gently fragranced air of the treatment rooms. If I ever return to Siem Reap, I will certainly visit Lemongrass Garden again. A wonderful way to wind down a full day of sightseeing in the hot and humid climate!"

We were provided with a welcome drink (Lemongrass and Ginger) and for a Cambodian (Kmer) 1 hour massage - no oil, which is just what I wanted nothing worse then leaving being oily and its hot outside it was only 12 USD. In a Khmer massage you wear a light white white long sleeve t-shirt and place loose tie up pants (they had air-conditioning and did not feel hot at all) This style of massage was relaxing and very different to that of a Thai or Vietnamese massage; very relaxing and enjoyable.The staff were friendly and very professional, they made it a lovely experience.

The welcome was warm and we were seated in a comfortable and nicely decorated reception area. Next we were given a relaxing tea before being taken into a room with massage chairs. Our feet were washed with salt and water and then we enjoyed one hour of massage. It was a very good. To end they took us back through to the reception for another refreshing drink.I returned in the afternoon with my wife to experience the famed four hand massage. Same great welcome. All I can say is you HAVE to come here and have this massage! It was amazing, both masseurs worked wonderfully in unison. A very relaxing and wonderful massage. So sorry we came on our last day, otherwise we would have come here everyday.There are cheaper places, mostly not so clean and massages sub standard.

What looks like a little standard massage shop from the outside, turns out to be the best massage & relaxation sanctuary, that I have ever visited. I was greeted by the friendly team at the front desk and pointed to the comfortable lounge area. From there I was given a cup of lemongrass tea, whilst I browsed through their list of many massages, which are all reasonably priced.My wife and I opted for the Spiritual Journey, full body massage (90 mins) which cost $38 USD. This massage was conducted by x 2 massage therapists (per person, at the same time) and is absolutely worth the money. The therapists asked if there was any problem area's, checked a number of times to see if we were comfortable and asked if the pressure was ok. After completion of the massage, there is no rush to get you out the door, as you are given another cup of tea to bring you back to reality.The place is very clean and beautifully laid out, the music is very relaxing and may put you to sleep. Lockers are provided close by, for you to put your clothes and valuebles into. The staff are extremely reliable and will make you forget about the world. They also offer pedicures, manicures and facials, if you desire the option.In my opinion, this was definately the best massage I have ever experienced in my life. I visited this wonderful place a few times during my stay and I highly recommend anyone to visit Lemon Grass when you visit Siem Reap, Cambodia.Enjoy!"

I think it is maybe the style of Khmer massage to do fast strokes, and I think this contributed to the problem. In massage school, you learn that the deeper you go, the slower the stroke, so that the muscle can relax under pressure. This massage was fast and very deep, which made my muscles tense involuntarily. The strangest part was when she took her elbow and rubbed very fast on my spine and shoulder blade...not on the muscles around it, but on the bones. I went with it to see if this type of massage would reveal some kind of amazing healing with its roughness. But I awoke today feeling like I got in a brawl. My back is in a lot of pain. Maybe the fluffy massages here are okay...but I would never get the deep massage again."

I chose a one hour facial and a one hour massage and my companion chose 2 hours of various massages. They have all kinds of options, including being massaged by two masseuses. We had a room to ourselves and spent two perfectly relaxing and wonderful hours being pampered. They were conscious of our comfort and asked if the pressure levels were ok several times. They were.

I went with the cosmo massage (High pressure) but my massue didn't apply any pressure. Started off really well but disappointing attitudes who then stood in line waiting for a tip before we left. I wouldn't recommend even tho it is cheap."

The masseuses showed us the room and some terrible disposable underwear. Whilst my masseuse was giving an OK massage (hence the 2* rating) she was incredibly unprofessional. Laughing, snickering and whispering to her colleagues during the manage. She left several times only to meet up and laugh with her colleague in the bathroom. This left me feeling extremely dissatisfied. I wouldn't go again! Considering there are plenty other spas close by I would suggest try something different. Don't go here.. I certainly won't be going again."

We had an appointment set up by our hotel. When we arrived at the site (the one Pub Street), reception greets you with welcome tea and massage menus prior to your service, and after you choose your services, a massage therapist washes your feet and gives you flip-flops to wear. We both went with the combination package of a facial and a massage ($32 USD). The therapist walks you to a room with about four massage beds and curtains separating them. We were the only ones in the room we were led to, which was nice. The massage we received was better than any other massage that I've had in the US. The facial, however, just felt like my face was being massaged with the same products over and over again (it would have been better had they been able to do extractions). If I'm ever back in Siem Reap, I'd definitely go to Lemongrass again, but for the massage only."

Lots of pressing and kneading and stretching and pulling, but it was really good and hit the right sore spots. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a different experience (than in North America) and wanting to relax your muscles. Only thing I didnt love was the noise around me. There are about 5 to 6 beds in 1 room and others finished or entered during my massage and were talking loudly and opening and closing doors quite loudly too. Also there was someone washing something or in the washroom which ruined the ambiance a bit. Overall the staff was friendly and the service was great. The tea they gave us was also really good.

You get something to drink, your feet are washed and after a while you are invited in a private room for oil massage.The massage was good. Even if not as good as given in Sweden by a professional masseur (which knows the anatomy much better and can find the sensitive spots). But I think it is as good as it gets in Cambodia for a fraction of price payed in Europe.The second time I decided to try Khmer massage. Even if they state in the menu that there is no pulling and pushing (in difference from Thai massage) it is all this massage is about. A surprising thing was that the massage is performed with cloth on! Not my own, they gave me a kind of robe. I don't complain though. I guess it is how Khmer massage is to be done. So, if you want a skin contact, choose something else.Another difference is that Khmer massage is performed in a larger room with several beds divided by curtains. When I came in I was alone. But after the treatment began another customer (or may be several) came in and they were talking loudly destroying the ambience.If the management reads the review I would suggest to have a silence sign at the entrance and ask the customers be quiet when other customers have their treatment.After the massage you get a herb tea and sometimes a survey to fill.Overall impression is that the staff is very diligent and the treatments are worth the price."

However, the facial was very subpar. I was mainly annoyed that I didn't have the towel that covers the hairline on at the start- my facialist put it on during the last step when I already had lots of yoghurt and other facial products in my hair. Yuck. The manicure and pedicure was the worst I've ever received and I've received plenty in developing countries... The manicurist was cutting my nails with a cuticle clipper and clipped my skin. I understand it was an accident and I could tell she obviously felt bad but I was more concerned as to why she wasn't given proper tools to cut the nails (nail clippers...). The filing made my nails even worse- they're now very frayed. My top 3 nail colors ran out, so I settled with not so pretty colors. You have to wait for the nails to dry in the open room and I knew my nails weren't dry even though the manicurist kept coming in and saying they were dry. I felt pushed out the door even though I wanted to wait longer l (possible language barrier) and I got so frustrated with it all that I left and of course half my nails were ruined an hour later. I think maybe more training should be involved for the mani pedis.... Some might say well it's a developing country and I shouldn't expect a lot but I ended up paying $35 plus tip which is actually a decent amount for something I wasn't satisfied with. I normally pay $25 back home for a beautiful mani pedi. After my experience and reading other reviews it seems like lemongrass is best at massages? I wouldn't spend the extra $ on mani pedis. After I had a bad experience, I looked at other 1-3 star reviews to see if I was the only one with a negative experience (I'm not) and couldn't help but notice a pattern of the owner replying back to reviews: he is extremely defensive and never the one in the wrong. Not good management in my eyes after reading those replies... Wonder what he'll reply to this one oy"

So I keep coming back and bring more friends.The quality of massages depends entirely on the therapist you get--some feel like trainees who're learning to stroke a baby kitten. However, this is not an issue that's exclusive to Lemongrass -- many higher end (read: pricier) spas in town also feel like a lottery: \"Will I get a limp-wristed kitty stroker today or not?\"Also, it would be nice if the post-sightseeing sweaty client were offered a shower before a treatment. With shampoo and a nice aromatherapy shower gel, preferably.Of course, I'll be back, though!Tip: try the oil-based leg massage after walking and biking a lot. Bliss!"

It was painful. I let it slide and went for the mani / pedi. No massage, no pumice work. It's basically cuticle and pain. The pain work was sloppy. I'm taking it off as soon as I get home. Given the price, probably would have chalked it up to \"you get what you pay for.\" But the service wasn't good either. I felt like the entire time I was there, the lady helping me wanted me gone as quickly as possible. I left before my polish was dry just to get out. Also, they say you can 'choose to tip'. Well, they stand there when you are checking out, so it's not really a choice. I would have tipped regardless, but don't have signs stating otherwise. Maybe if you go just stick to a foot massage? It's not a spa."

Given that the equivalent cost back home would be approx \u00a345 you can't really argue with $20!Would recommend."

It cost USD$25The masseur was skilled and very strong. I did enjoy the massage a lot. However it felt a bit rushed and when requested to be separated from my female friends, they weren't quite impressed. They just put us in a room with some dividers. Perhaps it was for their safety but I didn't want to push it.The receptionist when we arrived weren't very friendly as well and kind of hurried us to confirm the type of massage. After confirming, they actually took quite a long time prepare the place and oil and we were just lying there waiting. Overall it is a place you can visit. It is not exactly cheap but it is still worth it."

After a long week in Cambodia, and a couple of night buses, we had a couple of hours to kill relaxing before we headed home. We found Lemongrass Garden on Tripadvisor, well recommended and were not disappointed. The spa offered some great package deals which we opted for. The staff were flexible and accommodating and we were lucky enough to be receive treatments there and then without an appointment. Based in what I would call a large town house, there are several floors of large, spacious private rooms, good ambience, clean, tidy and great atmosphere. The masseuses were very good, did a great job and the massages were very much worth the price. Looking around on the way over, it was probably slightly more expensive than other locations that we passed, but I'm a firm believer in paying a little extra to get a much better experience; and while I can't speak for the other places, I was definitely pleased with my choice. Even after the I would have had additional treatments if I'd had more time and money!Thanks again! Will no doubt be back to Cambodia and will visit when I'm next in the area!P.S. While I don't have kids, having seen the recommendation section below, the menu was very much aimed towards not only couples and traditional therapies, but also around families and kids - with a smaller selection of treatments for children of around 45 minutes, followed by a nap! While the parents completed their massage... genius."

One of the delights of travelling in Asia is the ability to get a good massage or spa treatment at a fraction of the cost of the equivalent service in Western countries.During our recent trip to Siem Reap, I chose Lemongrass Garden due to the good reviews on TA and convenient central locations.The day we wanted a massage there was a power outage and it was a very hot afternoon, our Tuk Tuk driver took us to another massage place that had a generator and thus airconditioning. I was a bit dubious but went in and got talked into it, so my wife and I were shown to a dingy, smelly room with a pathetic air-con unit. I couldn't stand it so we left before the massage began and demanded our money ($20US each) back. We then went back to Pub Street and had a drink at the Red Piano Bar. All of a sudden the power came back on and Pub Street lit up and the music started cranking. We high-tailed it to Lemongrass Gardens Location 1. I was so glad we did. It was so pleasant, clean and cool compared to the other dump and the staff were lovely with the receptionist speaking excellent English. I chose an oil massage and my wife had a manicure/pedicure.We had our feet scrubbed in a basin and dried and given clean slippers.I was shown upstairs to the therapy room that was cool, clean, nicely decorated, gentle relaxing music at a suitably low volume and a lovely subtle aroma in the room.The massage was very enjoyable with just the right degree of pressure, not too hard and not too soft. The therapist seemed to naturally hone in on problem areas and treat them accordingly. The massage finished off with a lovely scalp and facial massage for a bit longer than I had been used to receiving in Bali. I really enjoyed that!I have experienced quite a few massages, mainly in Bali and I would rate this right up there with the best of them.My wife enjoyed her mani/pedi, the skills and quality of the work done were first rate. The only thing a bit lacking was the quality and choice of colours of the nail polish itself. Although she is used to having gel or shellac nails done in Bali or at home.We enjoyed the experience so much that we returned 2 evenings later but no staff were available at location 1 but no problem, they could fit us in at location 2 and offered a free Tuk Tuk ride to get there.We both had massages this time and the whole experience was just as good as the first.There was no doubt in my mind that the therapists at both Lemongrass Garden Spas are very skilled indeed!The massages were $15US each and I think the mani/pedi was about the same price.Great value compared the the hovel we were taken to the first time and compared to most hotel \"in house\" spas.I would have no hesitation recommending Lemongrass Garden and I think the fact that we did return proves this."

I have visited both high-end and low-end spas. And I can honestly say that the 2-hour therapeutic full-body oil massage I had at Lemongrass (Location #2) today was the best I ever had. My masseur, named Phors, is the spa's only male therapist. He used the perfect amount of pressure and left me feeling totally relaxed and rejuvenated. The ambience in my room (lighting, music, temperature, etc.) was great as well. When I called to book the massage, the receptionist spoke perfect English and communicated all my preferences to the front desk, so that when I arrived, everything was ready. The $38 price was also amazing given the level of service. You're not going to see the kind of frills you might see at a high-end New York spa, i.e. peach-infused mineral water, plunge pools, etc. But you will get a fantastic massage for a great price in a clean and welcoming environment."

There are many massage places in Siem Reap and some are a bit dicey ( my roommate went to one advertised in the tourist map passed out in the hotels that turned out to be a thinly veiled brothel). I would recommend selecting ones that are well reviewed rather than merely cheap. Lemongrass Spa would be a good choice."

The polish got applied several times, and overall looks exactly they way I wanted. I've got two experts to work on my nails at the same time so it only took an hour. The salon is a quiet and pleasant place, they welcome you with a cold ginger tea when you enter (which is very refreshing coming from the heat), and offer a hot bael tea at the end (which is just perfect after the AC hour). I was immediately shown to a room with armchairs behind a curtain which was separated from the other places, so it was very pleasant and private. I tipped the ladies, and will certainly return."

After that we were led to a room in 4th floor, a lot of stairs, it's ok anyway, we were told to undress everything and change underwear, they gave us a small black underwear which can only hide your important thing in the middle. My wife even didn't wear bras.Then male masseur came into the room and try to give me a massage where my wife is totally undressed, who like that situation? Even the room was not dark, we could see each other very well, so me and my wife talked for a moment and I asked my male masseur \"Can we have female masseuse?\" in very polite way before he start the massage. He replied \"ok\" not in polite way, it was definitely rude, and opened the door, walked away, closed the door very strongly, I cannot say he slammed the door but I and my wife both could feel he is very angry. Is that something he has to be angry?I wore my clothes and went down to 1st floor to talk to manager, explained what had happened, she said sorry and going to change to female one, and she is just receptionist she dialed to the owner and I talked to owner directly, owner seemed to be nice guy, he also said sorry and tried to give me a discount for the massage we are going to have but we were not in a mood anymore, I refused to do that and we walked away.When you are only doing foot massage, I don't care about male or female, but it's body massage and 4 people are in the same room, bed is just next to each other, what kind of husband like to be in that place with a male masseur together with naked wife?"

The spa is beautifully decorated and the staff are very well dressed and polite.I was welcomed with a lovely cup of herbal tea which was refreshing. I also got another hot tea while my nails were drying. My manicure and pedicure was done by 2 girls who were very thorough and neat. There is a nice range of colours to choose from too.Would highly recommend a visit here!"

This traditional Khmer massage uses less pressure than a traditional Thai massage. That said, it doesn't mean that you don't feel anything or it's very 'light'. The masseuse did ask me if I wanted more pressure or not. The staff even helped us make a lunch reservation at the Haven training restaurant for after our massage. The only reason I'm giving a four star is because when we first arrived, the staff did not attend to us immediately even though we were the only ones there. We seated ourselves and asked her for the menu. She didn't even greet us with a smile which was odd considering how everywhere we went we were greeted with huge smiles. My masseuse however was very friendly and all smiles! Thank you lemongrass!"

Now we live in Thailand and have massage almost every week so we kind of know what we're talking about and what to expect. This massage was not it!Listed as \"Aromatherapy massage\" the oil used had zero aroma. Alarm bells should have rung when we were not offered to choose an oil on arrival - which is typical for this type of massage and certainly what we had before.The massage staff were competent - not good, not bad just meh.The facilities were tatty - the room itself ok but not comfortable. We were going for dinner afterwards and expressly asked for a shower, unfortunately though there was a shower room there was no water pressure nor any soap with which to remove the oils.the massage cost $15 which is not a bad price - more than we pay in Thailand, but given that the service was so dire that was one of the most expensive massages i've ever had!We won't be coming back again on our next visit to Siem Reap"

This was OK as they arranged a tuk tuk and it only took a couple of minutes, but wasn't a great start. When we arrived at the second location we had our feet washed in the waiting area, this seemed very rushed and uncomfortable. We were taken in the couples room and asked to get changed. Before we were fully ready the masseuse came in which we find really odd. She then rushed to get us ready. The massage began and I must admit this massage was rather poor. The only part I enjoyed was the neck and shoulders. The rest of the massage felt let like someone was just oiling my body. I feel like they didn't take notice of my focus areas, I'm not even sure they looked at the sheet. The lady masseuse left the room for 5 mins without telling my wife where she was going. She then finished at the same time as mine, so my wife felt robbed of 5 mins.I was glad it was only 60 mins and didn't feel relaxed one bit. I went for the aromatherapy massage. The staff were friendly and the place was clean I was just expecting more. "

We had our massage in the same room and our masseurs kept talking with each other as if one of them didn't know what she is supposed to do and the other one was coaching her. Whenever one of them talk, she would stop the massage clearly unable to focus on both tasks at once. The massage itself felt clumsy, poking and not targeting the area a foot massage supposed to. The whole hour massage was rather irritating than relaxing. We had been to another foot massage salon which costed much less with much better skill and professional masseurs."

Our visit there was excellent, we had a amazing massage ( I would argue best ever in SE Asia), the staff was very friendly and accommodating even if we had no prior appointment. It was very clean and excellent value for money. The best place to go after a long day of visiting the temples."

We started with the body scrub, what an experience for a first timer, they spend a great amount of time getting you all clean and shiny. I would highly recommend this, since we come from a dry climate it was hard not to be sweaty and sticky in Siem Reap I'm sure both us and the massage therapist appreciated this. We then had the red wine facial, this was my first, and probably last, facial. Not that they did a bad job, just not my thing I learned. Then the absolute highlight of our visit, the four hand massage with aromatherapy oil. The therapists mirror each others motions with such skill that at times it feels like there must be more than just four hands. Don't miss this experience. I want to go back to Cambodia just to do this again.."

The room is not perfect like first time.. and they turn on the Fun together with air-con .. the room become hot and not smooth.. the air from fun touch rough on your skin... really annoying.. I did not noticed that. The woman that time was not really good for me.. she used force ... and they can understand English very well. For 2 customers, they use one can speak understand English and another cant speak English. And she look not very patient on me... I was not happy the second time :( and in my point of view.. jasmine oil is best for women, lemongrass is strong and good but other are strong and not good aroma."

We were massaged in a couples room and left to change into the little outfits. The men were to wear a kimono style shirt and pant and I was given a disposable pair of underwear. I am always conscious of privacy in a massage and they explain what they want you to wear and give you privacy to get changed and then come back when you are lying under your towel. There are lockers to lock your belongings in. It was a very nice relaxing massage. I would go back Myself and try longer packages and I would recommend to others. The experience is nicer than that of the open air cheaper massages, but still very cheap!! $15 for 1 hr. Money very well spent!"

They also have a paper which you can write which parts of your body you want focused on or not touched.Their staff was super friendly. They gave us slippers to wear after serving you cold tea - which was so good - and had like a 5min foot scrub. Then we were brought to our room and had an amazing massage experience.  After the massage, they serve you hot tea.. Which was AGAIN also good and they even bring your shoes to you. It was a really good experience so we the next day we came back again. You don't need to call ahead to make a reservation. They have enough rooms and therapists there. Worth every penny! Cold tea, Hot Tea, 5min foot scrub and 1hr massage for $15?!? So worth it. With other spa's usually after getting a massage my body hurts the following day. Surprisingly i felt super energetic. No body aches or pain. So kudos to their staff!! :) "

The staff here has created a really nice flow from one part of the experience to the next, from check-in all the way to your mug of relaxing tea at the end. You keep your belongings in a small locker right next to the massage table and wear comfy pajama-type clothes during the massage. I have sensitive skin and sometimes worry about reacting to different products or oils, so especially loved that I could get an excellent massage without oils or creams. There are plenty of spas to choose from in Siem Reap and I'm sure many are great. For me, Lemongrass struck the perfect balance of luxe on a budget. It's really lovely and comfortable with no worries about cleanliness etc. At the same time, it's very well-priced and not over-the-top. Enjoy :)"

First, at the front desk is a young lady who speaks English pretty well. I was greeted with cold lemongrass tea and a cold towel while they prepared my room. I opted for a Khmer massage. (First, the masseuse they offered was male, but they hadn't even asked. i was slightly surprised they didn't ask preference). Anyway, no problem, a woman was available for my massage.My masseuse was great. She was quite firm but not thoroughly painful. There were some points that were slightly tough (like my back) but I thought that the pain was part of the Khmer experience. She spoke very little English so I basically just said \"Ouch\" when it was too hard or said \"less\". My one pointer tip is that as soon as your customer chooses, please turn on the AC in that room for it to cool down. I think i was already waiting 5 minutes before being shown my room so it could have been even cooler. It was still so warm I started to sweat again. Even the second room was still a bit on the warm side for the entirety of the massage. When I asked about if I could have aroma in the room, they said, \"yes if you like, it'll be lemongrass\" So I expected lemongrass. but the Khmer massage room had no smell. I asked about it (needed help translating), and then was shown a different room that was used for probably oil massages, and it did smell like lemongrass.For this I give a thumbs up and good credit to the staff to be accommodating its customer.In sum, good customer service, great massage but not the most amazing of my life."

We definitely made the right choice. We each had a 1 hour Khmer massage ($10) and a facial ($18) and both were fantastic. The staff were professional and lovely, checking whether you were okay throughout the treatment. Definitely a great idea to head in for a break from all the walking and templing."

The first day we had the 1hr aromatherapy oil massage, it was glorious! The rooms are air conditioned, dimly lit and have lovely light music in the background. There is also lockable boxes for your belongings. We both thoroughly enjoyed our massages and the staff were lovely. Day 2 we had facials, they were great also and we had the same staff as the day before. You get a massage with the facial too which we both really enjoyed. Day 3 I went and got a manicure/pedicure, the chairs are comfy and it's private with the curtains and dimly lit as well. The lovely young lady who did my manicure was really nice and we had a great chat. My nails looked great after 4 days of adventures walking around the temples in the heat. When you arrive you get cool tea and as you leave you get a warm tea, which was delicious. The service is great. If you're in Siem Reap, go here, you won't be disappointed."

Not too hard, not too soft, just perfect. After the massage you feel completely refreshed and relaxed.They give you a cup of tea, and ask for your opinion on the massage.When in Siem Reap, this is certainly the place to go for a relaxing massage.

Yesterday I had a foot scrub, body scrub and deep tissue massage and today I got a 90 minute deep tissue massage and pedicure after a long arduous day visiting temples. I think for each day I spent less than $40 which probably would've cost anywhere from $200-400 in the U.S. The massages were fantastic. Body scrub was a little weird because I've never had one before but it's a great treatment to cool you down after a long hot day. The scrub and water they apply is so cool and refreshing! The other piece of advice I have for you is make sure to let the girl at the front desk know if you have any specifications because the masseurs speak very little English other than a couple words."

Only a tuk tuk driver hanging out the front was there to let us know that we had to go to the other shop and of course he could take us. I understand these things happen sometimes but my husband had been emailing them to make the booking so they did have a point of contact for us.I decided to have a package which included a manicure, pedicure and foot massage. I had shellac on my nails which the girls proceeded to peel off. I did speak to them about soaking the nails first but they assured me it would be fine...The massage was lovely but they were a little too keen with the pumice and have given me a small sore on one of my heels. I'm also a little unsure of the quality of the polish as it damaged really easily over night and it still felt quite sticky the next day.The ladies were all lovely but the quality was just not there."

Nice and clean reception area and very appreciated cool air.

The AC unit was blasting and I wanted to spend the all afternoon there\u2026Everything is spotless clean and comfortable including the special massage beds with a hole for your head.Massage was excellent and exactly how I wanted, the masseuse asking regularly if it is how you like it and it was.After the treatment, another cup of tea and an interesting form to fill to make sure the client is happy or, if not, was went wrong. It is rare to find any business in this country asking customers if they are happy and then trying to make the appropriate changes if necessary.Good luck to your businessI will definitely go back to this little paradise.Highly recommended\u2026.!"

Massage in Siem Reap can be as cheap as a few dollars on the street to in the high double digits at some of the luxury places. I had 3 massages over 4 days in Siem Reap at both locations (near Pub Street and up by the KFC). I will say that the Pub Street does get quite loud at night - you can hear the loud bar across the street while getting a massage. It didn't really bother me, but if you want a quieter experience you might want to choose the other location. got the standard 60 minute Khmer massage - each time. Khmer massages were great and reasonably priced - although generally in a shared room separated by curtains. But it was comfortable, air conditioned and clean. Had somewhat varied experiences across 3 different masseuses - but they were all well worth the price paid. Started and ended each massage with teas."

I visit Siem Reap every three months and the staff and service at the Lemongrass is always a highlight of my time there. My favourite is the oil massage - a gentle calming massage with a perfect level of pressure. By the end of the treatment I high been lulled into a microsleep and feel perfectly relaxed and at peace.I have taken a number of friends there for treatments who were equally delighted.I can't wait to visit them again at the end of this month and highly recommend them for a superior service in Siem Reap."

I was a part of a group of four and one of the girl read all the good reviews in tripadvisor so we went in. I choose the Aroma therapy massage, the lady bathe me in oil, no pressure whatsoever, she talked for few times to the other girl that was giving the massage another person of the group. It felt that she either couldn't be bother or had not enough training.The place itself has a tired look about it.The people the work there all look quite bored and doing it just to bring some money home, no much enthusiasm. All this said 2 people of the group enjoyed their massages the other thought it was okish so either i had bad luck and go the wrong lady or i ve higher standards.The price for the massages is very reasonable i paid 15$ for mine.

And for the therapists, mine was okay. But one of our friend's therapist dozed off in the middle of the treatment. We had the last session of the day (9 to 11 pm) and maybe the therapists were tired.

We were in a narrow room with five relaxing chairs in a row. They used lotion with a mild minty scent that was relaxing. I have had many foot massages in Asia and they do a great job. Each found pressure points, adjusted for each person and made us feel comfortable and relaxed.Highly recommend after a long day of walking to tour Angkor Temples!"

Four countries, lots of hostel dorms, and sweating constantly as I explored the wonders of this amazing region, you get the drift. It was the final day of my trip before heading home and I decided to splurge with some comforting luxury.Lemongrass Garden (Pub St. location) came highly recommended and was very close to my hostel. The staff were so friendly and welcoming, offering tea (lemongrass, of course!) and a cold towel upon arriving as I selected my treatments. I chose the Khmer Natural Foot Scrub, Red Wine Facial, and Khmer Body Massage.The foot scrub was the perfect remedy to weeks of wearing sandals as I explored the dusty streets and temples. Fragrant and felt so good! The facial was also incredible. Being outside for weeks on end will take its toll on your face and skin so you've gotta take care of it. Red wine is a great antioxidant and works great. The topper was the Khmer massage. I had had several Thai massages on this trip and while it also feels great, it is also a real workout on your body. Khmer massage on the other hand is much more relaxed and gentle. You feel like your just floating away on a cloud while the friendly masseuse does her magic.The 2.5 hours I spent here were just pure bliss. By SE Asian standards, it is pricey (~$30 for everything I had) but the treatments are a fraction of the cost compared to the West. Great staff, wonderful ambience, and phenomenal treatments. I couldn't have asked more anything better.P.S. I love the clothes they get you to wear during the massage!"

Great customer service and they are very clean. I would recommend the deep tissue oil massage is you like stronger massages. Lin did an excellent job and is also very sweet. It was the right level of deep massaging with soothing strokes that I fell asleep like a baby.I also got a pedicure and a foot massage. Lin also worked on me for these treatments and did a great job. They really work to scrub off the dead skin (unlike some pedicures I have gotten in the states) and spend a long time treating your callouses. Foot massage was also very relaxing. "

The staff were very friendly and pleasant and the foot scrub was a nice touch prior to the massage. My girlfriend and I opted for the khmer massage and it was extremely relaxing. At one point I fell asleep which was a testament as to how good the massage was. The lockbox for valuables was also a nice touch for peace of mind.I hate to nitpick but the building was across the street from the night market and the live band/karaoke drowned out the soothing music inside of the massage room (nothing Lemongrass can do about that).The room was also a few degrees (celsius) warmer than I would prefer but hardly noticeable once the massage started (it was that good) Overall I would highly recommend. The experience was great and the prices were very reasonable. I would definitely return."

The location we went to was located quite close to the only KFC outlet in Siem Reap. The masseurs are very friendly and asks us if we feel okay about the pressure applied to the body throughout the massage and so is the lady at the front counter. She speaks great english too and even gave us the feedback form at the end of the massage to make sure we are okay with the services offered. For the environment , the rooms comes with individual air-conditioning as well as a soothing music to accompany you with the massage. Overall , it 's a great experience and until now , here I am in Phnom Penh , yours is so far the best and unbeatable in terms of the environment and quality. Will definitely come again if I have the time."

Compared to other options in the area, this place seems slightly higher on the price but we are talking about less than $5 difference. Overall, I'll recommend this place for anyone looking for a quick massage after a long day. This place is definitely one of the top choices for clean and safe massage in the area."

It is very well kept, everyone was very professional, and deserves 5/5 stars. We both got a full body deep tissue oil massage, and my therapist gave me the best massage I've ever had.

I was greeted with tea and a foot wash. The treatments were wonderful! I had a body scrub,aromatic massage (lemongrass) and a facial. I never do this but it was just lovely. Yeng was so professional and did such a wonderful job. I felt so relaxed getting onto the plane that evening. The massage was just as strong as I wanted and really hit my muscles well. The body scrub smelled and felt amazing and my facial (multivitamin) was just fantastic (as was the scalp massage that went along with it.) The rates are beyond reasonable. The atmosphere is calm and quiet with unobtrusive but relaxing music. The shower in the room is clean and refreshing. There is a locker in the room for your things.

They welcome you with a cup of herbal tea (and then give you another after your massage!). Massages well priced- we had khmer aromatherapy body and a head and shoulders 1.5 hr massage for $25 (I think this was their most expensive option? they had cheaper options too). It was well worth the money and we left feeling so relaxed! The staff were all very friendly and professional, and it was a lovely relaxing environment. All in all, I would 100% recommend and would definitely return :)"

After reading countless reviews, we settled on the Lemongrass location near Pub street. Upon our arrival we were given a wonderful cup of tea. The prices are a bit more than the spas you see on the street, but well worth the few extra dollars. I signed up for a two hour treatment (one hour foot massage for $10 and a one hour aromatherapy massage for $15). They both were AMAZING! The spa itself is clean, well organized, and quiet during your services. The staff was professional, answered any questions you had, and was in tune to your needs. I highly recommend visiting Lemongrass when visiting Siem Reap. My only disappointment was that I should have gone my first day instead of my last. Go early so you can squeeze in multiple visits before you leave. You will not be disappointed!"

Lemongrass was the best massage I have received yet! There are four main reasons why. First, the staff showed a high level of professionalism and friendliness from the moment we walked in. They made us feel at ease and completely comfortable in our environment. Second, the atmosphere in the massage room was excellent. The music was calming, the temperature was cool, and everything was clean and neat. Next, and I know this is nitpicky, but it's important to me, there was a hole in the table for my face!! In so many places across Asia you are given a floor mat and a pillow, and it's always a bit uncomfortable. Not so here! Finally, the actual massage was luxurious. Each body part was paid equal attention to. In fact, a highlight of this aromatherapy massage was that the massage therapist spent a good portion of time on a neck, head, and face massage. Too often this area of the body is an afterthought, and it feels as is the therapist is rushing to get through it and finish. Lemongrass was truly a treat, and I would highly recommend a visit if you ever find yourself in Siem Reap!"

We visited the location that is close to Park Hyatt and KFC last month and I must say, we all felt that the massages were the best we have ever had! We left feeling so relaxed and rejuvinated after days of walking around the temples! This second location is definitely worth it as it is away from Pub Street, and is in a noticably quieter part of town. Both massages I had were done by a lady called Smey, I had the Aromatherapy massage for 60 minutes, as well as a foot massage (which also had touched on a few minutes of a back massage and legs, i lost count of how many minutes she spent on each area as I was so relaxed). I visited with three other people, one visited numerous times and demanded the same lady every time (she was that good) and got the deep tissue massage for 60 minutes. The other two received the aromatherapy as well, with one also getting a foot massage. All four of us claimed it was one of the best massages we have ever had, and for the rest of the trip we rated future massages based on our experiences at this place. Definitely worth the money we spent, all staff we encountered were very friendly with an acceptable level of English (I didn't have any problems with language barriers though). The facilities were clean, and the toilet was acceptable too (toilet paper and soap were provided). They also allow you to indicate where you would like to have massaged or not massaged which I havent seen in Asia before, but is common at home. The only tip I would give is to visit the 2nd location as we did (near KFC and Park Hyatt) as this would definitely be the better location of the two. Will definitely be back if I visit Siem Reap again."

After a hard morning horse riding at Happy Ranch Horse Farm (which was excellent) my friend and I were so sore and dying for an excellent massage. We had a really good one in Phnom Penh two days before which was a bit more expensive but well worth it, so we thought we spend a little bit more to get a really good experience. After looking through a few guides and reviews, we stumbled across Lemongrass which seemed to have won some Tripadvisor award for excellent only last year. Immediately after stepping in, we were greeted by a moody faced lady who stiffly asked what treatment we would like. At that point we started to worry that the treatment might not be what we expected. After we lay down in the room and the massage started my friend noticed that her masseur was repeatedly yawning and mine was just looking around looking bored. I could feel, without looking, that my masseur was not bothered about my treatment. She was just pouring oil all over me so that it dripped onto the blanket and seemed to be just using her hands to spread it around without any pressure. After asking for more pressure she did press harder....for about 5 MINUTES and then returned to sloshing the oil around all my body.The 'massage' or should I say 'oil bath' ended with a vicious head rub. I thought she might be angry at me and was trying to scratch my hair out of my scalp! Afterwords my head was burning and my body felt as if it had not been touched at all.I cannot understand the other reviews of this place, because honestly, this was one of the worst massages I've ever had, and believe me, I've had a lot! My friend and I even both felt the $8 massage we had in our room at the Claremont Hotel was 100 times better and less than half the price!!"

Feet, arms, hips, joints -- everything ached. So I walked down the street to look for a massage place. I didn't really intend to go specifically to Lemongrass but after hearing about it from other foreigners in my guest house, I've decided to give it a try. I opted for the Khmer massage because I wanted to compare it to the massages I got from my home country. It was divine! Simply the way I liked it. If you hate the icky, sticky, feeling of oil, lotion, etc. in your skin and if you hate getting naked for massages (like I do), opt for this one. It has same therapeutic effect sans the awkwardness. I liked that my attendant was using other parts of her body like her elbows other than just her hands during the procedure. Shows you how skilled she is. The combined power and restraint in applying pressure was simply masterful. Not the most expensive but you truly get your money's worth; it'll make you feel a bit guilty even cause it somehow feels like a splurge."

I didn't want to spend an unnecesaary amount of money on a massage, but I was willing to pay more than a couple bucks for somehing nice. Found Lemongrass on trip advisor and thought it sounded worth a try. I'm soooooo glad I found this place! I got a 60 min aromatherapy massage for $15. First, they start you off with a cold, refreshing drink (basically a chilled tea, I think) as you walk in from the hot and humid outdoors and sit down to choose from their menu of treatments. I was unsure if I should choose the aromatherapy (my ultimate goal was just to relax and feel good), or the deep tissue (I had some gnarly knots in my back for a while prior to this and really wanted a bit of work done on them, but wasn't looking for a painful massage experience). I talked with the guy at the front desk about what I wanted/didn't want and he suggested an aromatherapy massage, but had me fill out a card showing where my knots were and communicated to the masseuse to work on those areas a bit. Then, I went in back with her for a quick foot soak and scrub that actually started to relax me quite a bit right away. Then we went upstairs to get the massage underway. I had chosen ylang ylang as my oil fragrance and it was great. Very soothing and pleasant. In the beginning I found the masseuse asked me many times if this was ok, and that was ok, if the air con was ok, and if the pressure was ok... I was a little worried ahe would keep checking every few seconds throughout the hour, but after telling me to let her know if anything hurt, she went about giving me the best massage of my life and only checked back in a few times to make sure. I think they just want to make sure you speak up if you're not satisfied with something, want the pressure, increased, decreased, etc. I thought it was perfect. The ambiance, including decor, lighting, and music, were all perfect for helping me relax while I was at Lemongrass, and the massage was pure heaven. At the end, I was given a cup of their special warm tea made from some kind of Indian fruit, I think it was. Very tasty. I did tip my masseuse several dollars, not because I felt I was expected to or needed to, but because she had really done an excellent job and I thought she deserved it. I felt so amazing after all the work she diid, and it doesn't seem easy!Hopefully that helps you decide whether this is the place for you. I know I would go back every day if I could!"

They have two parlours in Sivatha Boulevard itself - one close to Pub street, one further away from it. I visited the one close to Pub street on the first day and had their signature Cosmic connection massage. It was simply exhilarating! I felt completely cleansed and fresh at the end of the session and I had decided then to get another massage the next day. However, there was some renovation work happening at this parlour and I was fairly disappointed. Just as I was about to leave, one of the parlour's staff came up to me and realising that I was looking to get a massage, took me to their other parlour on a tuk tuk; she paid for the tuk tuk which kind of impressed me. I had a bus to catch that evening. So I decided to go for a shorter massage and picked the Khmer massage. While not as good as their signature Cosmic connection, it was great value for money at around 10-12 USD. They have highly professional and well trained masseuses. You should definitely check this parlour out if you're living near pub street or sivatha rd"

And I went to this place right after I'm back from the tiring temple whole day temple tour. the place was walking distance from my hotel. And I noticed 1 male and 1 female masseur outside the place. Once I entered and looking though the menu they served me a very refreshing Lemongrass ginger tea. I decided to go with the the traditional Khmer massage. It was 10$ per hour. The massage room was wide with curtains separating each beds. There is a locker box for each beds and they provide traditional robe for you to change. The massage was very pleasant. i almost fell asleep during massage. It was perfect. Compare to other places I like it here so much. I was massaged by a guys named DA if i'm not mistaken. After the massage they serve another drink called applewood team. It was good too. I'm looking forward for my next visit to Siem Reap to try this massage and by the way DA is very good masseur I should tips him. LOL"

My girlfriend and I booked an appointment in advance via email for the 1.5 hour, $15 Khmer massage to unwind from the long plane ride on the first day so we could go straight to dinner afterwards without being oily. Due to problems at our hotel we were late for our appointment and they only had one not two staff available which turned out to be a blessing in disguise. They called over a guy from their other location. We headed up several flights of stairs to the common room with tables separated by hanging sheet dividers. They do have more private rooms on the lower floors so if you are booking in advance try and request one of those especially in the hotter months since they don't have AC in the building. We changed in to the Khmer robes and locked our stuff in the cabinets provided. You start lying on your back which i was not used too. I like a good hard deep tissue massage and was not sure what to expect. My guy was great, really strong and worked each muscle group evenly, a real pro. My girlfriend doesn't like a hard massage but said hers was very good but could have been a bit more firm. We had to get to dinner so couldn't sit around for the post massage pleasantries, paid up, everywhere in Siem Reap except hotels are cash only, and grabbed a tuk tuk right out front. Two days later we had extra time in town and walked back over to lemongrass to try the oil massage. They were able to take us and although I liked my Khmer massage more this one was very good too, my girlfriend liked this one more. At $15 and this kind of quality try and get at least an hour massage everyday you are in town."

I don't pamper myself with such treatment very often so I opted for the herbal full-body scrub and deep tissue massage, which were 60 minutes each. The service staff were very welcoming when we entered and we were immediately served with cold towels and a drink.I visited with a friend and they automatically assumed that we were comfortable with being in the same room. Well, we weren't, so we requested to be placed in separate rooms and the staff willingly obliged. Would have preferred that they had asked us before hand though, to save us and them the trouble. The room temperature was just right and I appreciated how my masseuse constantly asked if I was feeling ok and whether or not I was too cold. My treatment started off with a scrub and once it was completed my masseuse told me that she would be gone for \"1 minute\" but then left the room for what felt like 10. I was left lying there trying to figure out where she was gone and why. Would have been nice if she had told me what was happening so I would have been aware about what was going on. She came back, asked me to shower so that I could get my deep tissue massage, which was very soothing. It hurt a little, but I thoroughly enjoyed it."

Firstly, I was led into a dark room where the air conditioner and lights were not even switch on. Secondly, I think the masseuse who cares over me is very lacking in her skills, I feel that she's merely putting the oil and rubbing through. This is the most unsatisfying massage experiment I have ever had where the masseuse does't not have the skill and strength at all. Personally, I prefer a medium soft massage, however this time of visit to Lemongrass makes me feel that i'm being OILED rather than massaged.Since the price is considered more premium that others average outlets, I really appreciate if better skilled masseuses are being engaged. Once the reputation is tarnished, it's so hard to salvage. This service in term of skill in my opinion is comparable to roadside massage centre."

That day I took the coffee scrub and I could really recommend that switch from a massage to a scrub because it was just wonderfull. The facial on the otherhand was Nothing spectaculair and I kind of regret chosing it. So for a massage or a scrub in Siem reap this is were you should go. It may be a little more expensive (around 20 euro's) but they are professional and the place is really clean. "

They also give you a refreshing towel upon arrival which was amazing!I think I just expected more having paid more than I could have in other places. I think what would have made it better would be little extra touches, like being introduced to the person massaging you by name, being given the option of a drink between treatments, the masseur letting you know why they are leaving the room if they do, and the treatment room being a bit cooler. I found it quite hot in there. The music could have been a tad louder as I could barely hear it, and the toilet facilities were not pointed out at all during my visit. All small things but add up when you think about it.Overall it was a pleasant experience and I enjoyed my massage - I think it was just overhyped on Trip Advisor and with some very minor adjustments could be an amazing place!"

Lemongrass was recommended by our daughter who went there a few weeks ago while traveling and told us that this was the place to go. It is very clean and we had our own private room. They gave us this special black throwaway underwear type shorts to wear which I had never seen before which added to our comfort. We had a choice of scents and choose the jasmin. We started off with the 90 minute and 5 minutes into it, told them we wanted two hours. When we were done, we then decided to indulge in the sensitive facials since the same people would be doing it and the first two hours with them were so terrific. They were very professional. There was spa music in the background, the room was cool, and the tables were comfortable. For the facial, they put on a cold mask which was fabulous. We spoke to the owner at the end. He is a really nice guy from England who moved here a few years ago whose wife was in the business and trained all of the girls who work there. Excellent place! These girls work very hard to please. I gave them a 20 percent tip which they truly deserved. They were very appreciative. I highly recommend this place! Bring cash because they don't take credit cards."

I left feeling rejuvenated!The spas are clean and smell lovely with subtle lighting and soothing ambient music to relax too.I've been to a few spas in Cambodia but what stands out most about Lemongrass is the friendly staff. They seem to genuinely enjoy their jobs and it shows, some speak a little English so I knew that I could communicate any specific requests. They also have a leaflet in reception where you can mark on the body how strong you want your massage or weak depending on your personal needs.Overall a great experience, staff were discreet when necessary and the facilities such as the shower and bathrooms were fresh and clean.

And, compared to the prices in my hotel spa, this was very good value for money. I had booked at the spa opposite Pub Street but when I arrived the receptionist said that there was some noisy building work a couple of shops away so I was popped in a tuk tuk and taken to their other spa just down the road.

I got the head massage, facial and pedicure package at 27 dollars while my mom got the 90 minute deep tissue massage. She started with the facial and I was disappointed I didn't get a room, but hey that's fine since we are in Cambodia. But the worst thing was I started to notice a smell when she started my facial. Her hands wreaked of fish! And she kept swabbing my eyes, which is a really delicate area that you have to avoid. Because I didn't have the heart to tell her, and seriously I had problems telling her to be gentle around the eyes, I just tried not to let the fish smell bother me. Otherwise the facial was just a series of stuff put on your face. The head massage was ok. The pedicure was just a nail cut and lime rubbed over. No fancy cleaning, or buffing. She scrubbed the wrong areas of my feet. She should be scrubbing the hard callouses but instead she scrubbed the soft areas of my feet. I asked my mum how was her massage and she said, that was definitely not deep tissue. We paid and even tipped them and left dissatisfied customers. That was the first spa we went to and my mum and I made it a point to try out all the different spas while we were here for a week, and let's just say you can definitely find a better place down the road. Also, I found the reply to another reviewer quite inappropriate. Please take the negative feedback graciously as being defensive only reflects on your personality.

The massage is just slightly above-average quality but consistent and cheaper than other nicer spas. Whatever massage I ask for (deep tissue, aromatherapy, or signature cosmic connection), I seem to get the same treatment, but I do not mind for this price. They have a customer card for 1 usd - gives 10% discount on 2nd visit, 20% 3rd and 30% on subsequent visits (10% for your guest). Very good deal! overall excellent if you just want to relax a little without paying much. if you are looking for a very good massage, you need to pay twice as much somewhere else"

We found Lemongrass on tripadvisor and we're not disappointed at all. We were able to walk in and be seen immediately without an appointment. The receptionist gave us a menu of treatments and left us alone to choose, there was no hard sell at all. We were given a lovely cool drink whilst we sat and looked through all the options I had the 90 minute Khmer massage and my partner had the 60 minute aromatherapy massage followed by a manicure. Both massages were fantastic. The Khmer massage was firm but not at all painful and was just the tonic for my tired, temple-worn legs. The place is lovely and relaxing, clean and safe. There is a locker for every treatment table so you can store your stuff whilst you relax. The staff are lovely and very professional. We had a fantastic time and would recommend it to anyone looking for a peaceful, lovely, reasonably priced spa."

            "review": "Don't go for nail services. I wanted to try this spa because of the wonderful review on this website, but I went in for a mani/pedi and not a massage. I knew this was a risk, since most of the wonderful ratings were based on the massages, but I figured I'd give it a try.To be honest, I regretted going to Lemongrass for my mani/pedi; there are other spas that have better mani/pedi services, some at even cheaper rates. There were a number of things that were disappointing about my experience. Please note that I am trying my best to be as partial and fair as possible in this review.First, one of the ladies at reception told me that the mani/pedi spa (USD$15) would include a foot scrub. I'd pointed to the foot scrub service on a different part of the menu and asked 3 times if the mani/pedi included that 30 minute scrub. She nodded affirmatively that it would. Though I didn't expect that my $15 mani/pedi would include such a lengthy, thorough scrub, I was disappointed that the lady only exfoliated my feet for less than 30 seconds each foot. Exfoliation of the hands lasted, perhaps 5 seconds, and only on the upper surface of the hand, not including palms or fingers. Ok, for $15, I guess what can you expect?.......though I type that hesitantly, because it is still a fair bit of money for spa services, by south-east asia standards.Second, the receptionist told me the mani/pedi would only take an hour. It took double. It took so long that I was late for a subsequent lunch reservation and had to rush out before my nails had dried. Another lady (perhaps the manager?) apologized for the delay, and helped me phone the restaurant to ask if I could still attend the lunch, but I was quite annoyed that I was 25 minutes late despite having given myself a 30 minute buffer. I appreciate that the woman who did my nails was trying to do a careful job (maybe? I'm giving her the benefit of the doubt), but I've had plenty of mani/pedis where people work much faster. She looked a bit worn down; a bit tired. I felt bad, so I didn't want to rush her or tell her that I had to run.Third, the woman who did my nails wasn't well-trained, in my opinion. She did not follow the natural shape of my nail (square/flat nails with curved corners) and cut my nails far too round. I stopped her early on to gently explain my preferred shape for my nails; there was a language barrier, so eventually I borrowed the nail file and filed my nail to show her what I meant. She sort of understood and continued. When she reached my left hand, she seemed like she'd lost steam and left the nails much longer than the right hand. I pointed out that I wanted them shorter and she went back to filing them down (I don't know why she didn't use a nail clipper in the first place since that would have taken less time than filing down the length).Fourth, the colour on the fake nail palatte was completely different from the colour that was painted onto my hands. I pointed this out right away, after she applied coat 1 onto one hand. I noticed that the colour was off and inquired. We checked the number label on the nail polish to the number label on the palette; she went outside to double check something; she came back and indicated that it was, indeed, the \"same.\" I didn't want to waste more time figuring this out, so I told her that it was ok and that she should continue. After 3-layers of paint, it was absolutely and unquestionably clear that the colours did not correspond. I wanted a pale, ballet pink; I got a bright peach-pink. I pointed this out to the receptionist when I was rushing to leave. She asked if I wanted to change the colour but I was (1) already running very late, and (2) only showed her the difference to suggest that they should re-paint the palette. She replied that it was different because only 1 coat was applied to the palette. I don't see how this is a good excuse, and in any event, I could tell it was a different colour altogether even after just 1 layer. My pedicure was fine. But my manicure I've already removed, 1 day later. I can now see that a lot of my cuticles still remain too...so the entire manicure was really poorly done. The polish was quite streaky too.I enjoyed the tea that they served before and after the service. The people were friendly. I don't blame the woman who gave me the mani/pedi; I feel that she was not adequately trained, so it probably wasn't her fault. I don't want her to get penalized in any way by this review. I think management needs to improve their mani/pedi training and services. Until then, readers should only go to Lemongrass for their massages because it seems like those are pretty good (but I wouldn't know)."

What I liked on the outside of the building was the greenery of the flowers and plants outside which gave the spa a natural calming feel as soon as you walk towards the entrance. I also noticed the refreshing smell of Lemongrass as soon as you walk which I thought was a nice touch given the name. Being from the UK, Lemongrass for me is one of the distinctive fragrances of South East Asia/spas and in a spa setting, have always found that relaxing.If you have been to Siem Reap centre you know it can be a bit manic so Lemongrass Garden is a very welcome step into a calming and relaxing environment. Very professional receptionist and staff and importantly no one outside shouting Massage at you and touting for your business like some of the nearby places I think proving Lemongrass Garden have a good reputation, coupled with the fact I noticed there is another one of their spa\u2019s a little further down the road. I was welcomed by the receptionist who spoke good English and not long after I was sat down and handed a menu of treatments, given flip flops as shoes are taken off outside there and given a herbal tea (Bael) which came with an explanation of its properties within the tray. I haven\u2019t visited too many spas but found that also was a nice touch. I didn't have to wait long to be met by my masseuse and taken to the treatment room. I decided to go with a 60-minute Deep Tissue massage which was given by a female masseuse, I was shown to an upstairs treatment room. There was air con and a fan in the room and some gentle musicAs I\u2019d been travelling for quite a bit of time my masseuse gave me a few mins of privacy to shower (which is inside the treatment room) and get comfortable. There was a cupboard in the room to lock my belongings, I didn't use as I was the only customer at the time but it\u2019s reassuring to know if needed. My masseuse although she didn't have much English was able to ask me if the massage pressure as well as room temp was ok to make my treatment more comfortable. In all honesty I wish I had booked my massage for 90 mins, I had a lovely experience from start to finish and if I went back to Siem Reap, I would definitely visit again and book that longer treatment! Thank you to the great staff and cracking management for making my trip to Lemongrass Garden Spa so wonderfully relaxing!"

Prior to arriving in Siem Reap I did some research on the local spas and thanks to the reviews I read on TripAdvisor, I opted for Lemon Grass and clearly made the right choice. On my very first night In Siem Reap I visited LG for a full body massage. I was warmly greeted by the staff upon arrival, then taken to a nice room for my treatment. The massage was just right and afterward I knew I had to come back. Sooooo, I made another appointment for a body scrub, foot scrub, and massage package. As I was getting ready for the massage, it was then that I realized there was a misunderstanding on my part. I thought I had purchased a Swedish oil massage but in fact the package included a Khmer massage. Not a big deal at all. Another staff member immediately came in and showed me the menu and advised I could upgrade to the oil massage and I did. So easily taken care of from the start with just a little communication. Suffice it to say, my second visit to Lemon Grass was just as enjoyable (if not more than) as the first.I chatted with the owner, Chris, briefly afterward who was kind enough to also give me some helpful info about the local area.Lemon Grass is such a lovely spa with great staff and a great value for the price. Keep up the great work and I will definitely return should I find myself again in Siem Reap!"

            "review": "So happy this place is still here!. About a year ago when visiting Siem Reap I had the usual travellers aches and pains and sorely needed a massage.Only problem is I always have trouble finding a place that doesn't look a little sleazy or somebody out the front calling out \"fish massage mister\" etc which completely puts me off and I end up just walking past and living with my aches and pains. So one afternoon I was sitting at the Triangle bar with a great view of the surounds and noticed this leafy garden outside a shop called LemonGrass offering massage. No spruikers out the front, just an inviting fish pond(NOT foot massage fish!) and cool laid back atmoshpere.So I thought I may as well give this place a go still worried that it may be crappy or worse! and I'm glad I did!The staff were really friendly and DIDNT try to talk me into anything I didn't want, especially a stoopid fish massage which they don't have by the way. So I had a 90 min full body oil massage and I walked out of there feeling like a new man.Fast forward a year and back in SR again on my way to Thailand I wondered if that same Massage place was there.So I asked the Tuk Tuk guy if he knew it and sure enough we were there in about 5 min. I was pleasantly surprised to find the place had been made nicer with a mild renovation and looked even more inviting and refreshing! The fact that the shop is still there apparently owned by the same Khmer and western owner couple says volumes about the place considering businesses and shops come and go in sth east Asia on a weekly basis.Now I'm a bit of a wuss and don't enjoy hard Thai massage so I asked if they could go easy on me but still work out the knots in my back and legs. So basically They tailored a massage to my liking being careful to ask me if it was too hard or soft. Considering these ladies aren't professionally trained as would be in the west they give an excellent massage bordering on remedial in my case which was perfect. The rooms are so relaxing I almost fell asleep and they let me lay there for a while I collected myself and steeled myself for the hard slog due later that arvo to the Temples.So If I'm in SR again I know i can rely on getting a quality, relaxing massage with no strings attached.Thanks Lemon Grass!"

            "review": "Gave me the wrong massage!. My boyfriend and I came here because of the reviews on Trip Advisor. We chose our massages and we were led to a small chair to have our feet scrubbed prior to changing into their shoes. At that point we were led to two separate rooms which is something I would've preferred to have been aware of ahead of time. We had asked for two different types of massages but not types that should've let us to different areas being that we made it very clear we wanted to be there as a couple. We originally thought we were being led to the male and female locker rooms when we both realized separately we were being led to massage rooms. I was led to an open bay room upstairs, which is not uncommon, and changed into the pants and shirt I was to wear for the massage. I was a little concerned that despite a very wispy curtain blocking me from other clients, I was asked to change in a pretty open area and was easily visible to anyone coming in. I instead opted to use the restroom to change and thought I'd use the restroom before the massage started until I realized there was no toilet paper or tissue of any kind. Gross. I went back and settled in and the woman that began my massage was very nice, but primarily just used her two thumbs for pressure so the majority of the massage felt like I was just being poked that. She definitely had some kind of training but I can tell you that I left with a couple physical bruises instead of feeling relaxed. I had actually chosen the 90 minutes foot massage and about halfway through I found myself noticing that my feet had not even been touched. I assumed at this point they would probably do a small amount of massage on the entire body before spending the majority of the time on your feet. Before I knew it, she told me I was done and I realized that my feet had not once been touched unless it was to move my leg. I was also frustrated by the fact that the couple getting a massage to my right felt no need to be quiet and talked continuously throughout the entirety of their massage. The loud laughing and giggling between the two of them did not make this a very relaxing experience. My suggestion for this would be to have some sort of signs posted, maybe on the small lockers, asking clients to respect others. I also believe that it would not have been a rude thing for one of the staff members to ask them to please keep their voices down. In a big open bay, I knew I would have some noise, but this was ridiculous. I was then asked to change back into my regular clothes and led downstairs to the room that my boyfriend and I would both be getting facials in. Our facials were extremely mediocre and essentially it was a couple different creams to wash, a couple masks applied, then you leave with a very sticky lotion on your face. There was no steam or any heat whatsoever to open the pores so anything applied topically just sits on your skin. To wash off and reapply the next layer, they use a small bucket full of water and the same sponges are rinsed off in that bucket and put back on your face, just reapplying the same thing they already washed off and rinsed in that bucket. We were happy to be finally done and we were asked to sit in the lobby and immediately handed survey and comment cards about our stay. We were asked to fill these out sitting a couple feet away from the reception and with our massage therapists standing over us. This did not appear to be a voluntary thing. It honestly made me feel uncomfortable to fill out my opinions and comments while I was being stared at by the staff. I got up with the menu and asked the woman working the receptionist desk which massage I received. She pointed at the one below the one I asked for and when I told her they had given me the wrong massage and that's not actually what I chose, she stated, \"well I ask you\". With an obvious language barrier, I'm not sure quite sure what that meant but it sounded like she was saying that's the one that I had pointed to. The only problem with that is that I had not just shown her the menu and pointed to the one I wanted, but I also very articulately said the name of the massage that I wanted prior. It would be different if I just pointed at the menu and she saw the wrong one, but I pointed and stated the name. Once she understood that I was given the wrong massage, no apology was offered and I was still required to pay, the full price even, of the massage I never wanted. Perfect. I was surprised that after telling them they gave me the wrong massage and showing them what was already starting to be a bruise from the massage I didn't want in the first place, I was still asked to pay for what I got. Working on your customer service skills when something goes wrong is clearly a necessity here. I don't care if there's a language barrier or not. This was extremely poor practice. My boyfriend and I also tried to pay with our credit card given there is a MasterCard symbol hanging in the window. We were told that that was also not correct and we had to pay by cash only so went to the ATM in the market. The entirety of my experience here was well below any ideal industry standard in any country. My boyfriend and I left as quickly as we could, very upset with our service and advised the people we knew or met on our trip not to go here for this reason. My first suggestion would be to let couples were clearly there for a couples massage know ahead of time if there to be led to completely different areas. My second suggestion it is to have some small sign or some kind of trained staff to keep clients from ruining other clients experiences by a talking loudly and laughing through massages. My third suggestion would be to train the staff members to massage with their whole hand and not use their whole hand to hold an appendage and then just dig their thumbs in the whole time. This is not a comfortable experience, especially considering the massage they gave me was apparently a dry one. No lotions or oils are used and hence my bruises. My fourth suggestion would be to add some sort of heat source whether it's a warm towel or an actual steam machine for the facials. This is not just a Western practice but a well-known commonality that steam and he'd open your pores and therefore anything applied to the skin after that is absorbed more appropriately. Putting a cold towel on my face and letting the pores close before applying three different sticky creams and a thick lotion before we leave to head back into the humidity did by make me feel refreshed in any way. Next, when asking customers to fill out surveys or, cards, please understand that it applies quite a bit of pressure when they're commenting about staff members hovering 2 feet away from them. I understand how important these cards can be for your business, but that doesn't mean they have to be so closely watched by staff members. It makes clients want to put answers that may not necessarily be correct because they're being eyed while filling these out. We honestly couldn't even enjoy RT because they were staring at us waiting for us to finish these cards. Finally, if a client points out what was a clear mistake, whether it was an honest mistake or otherwise, some sort of standard customer service should be applied. Whether it be a small discount to the price or a gift certificate to come back at another time for the massage that was actually requested, both would've been more than enough for me. Instead, I paid a full price for a massage that I not only didn't one but that was horrible and quality. And if you're going to advertise it's okay for customers to pay with credit card, you should probably start finding a way to except credit cards. I will never return here and I will recommend clients go elsewhere."

Very professional and relaxing. You'll find a nice foot scrub before a treatment and a cold jasmine scented flannel to cool yourself down mmm, just what you need in off the hot dusty streets of Siem Reap . . I mainly go for massage. I have tried quite a few of them my favourite being the cosmic connection with oil, which I did actually fall asleep during ha ha and I even forgot my shoes on the way out I was that relaxed and spaced out, true story. Felt like a bit of an idiot the next day returning with flip flops 4 sizes to big for me!! Nice tranquil surroundings and a cracking chilled ginger tea upon resurfacing to the outside world. And if that isn't alluring enough for you the prices are really good value for money and if your an expat like little old me you can purchase a membership card which gives you further discounts off already handsome prices . . . . . Go on, treat yourself!!!"

I went there twice, with the first encounter less than satisfying as all of us had varying experiences. However the clean environment considering what we paid, lured us back again. This time round we made prior booking for a 4 hands massage. It was spectacular. Imagine two masseuse by your sides, in perfect harmony, timing and pressure. It was so well synced that my friend commented it felt like only one person doing it instead of two. I definitely felt there were 20 fingers altogether:)After this experience, I would always ask for four hands massage. However I felt that there should be greater consistency in the standards of the masseuse as I didn't get to experience the wonderful head massage that my friend told me about. Thank you Trip Advisor for the recommendation."

I would not recommend going here for a pedicure. My facial was average at best. I didn't say anything while there to the staff but did write my opinion for them to see on the feedback form they offer so maybe they can improve their services. Again at $6/ pedicure, what else would I expect? The area for the facial and pedicure was an open room with a curtain, the noise from the street comes in and all lobby conversations can be heard as well, and when others come in for treatments they come in right next to you while trying to relax. The personnel set up their things and this is noisy as well. Sorry for the brutal honesty but I do so I hopes they can make improvements, very nice and friendly staff."

A good massage is normally characterized by a connection between the hands of the masseuse and the subject. Usually a masseuse will pick up on the areas that need attention & find the best ways to administer healing therapy This was completely lacking sadly. There was no beginning, middle or ending of any sort to our massage. I may as well have been a piece of wood. Talk to locals before getting a massage."

Unfortunately I do not know the girls name to recommend her, but she made me feel 110% after a long day and a few busy months. On arrival you will receive a ginger & lemongrass Iced tea to refresh you before the massuese will wash your feet and prepare you for the massage. I had the 60 min full body Khmer massage ($10) and every second was perfect :) They provide clothing for you to change in to and I thin showers were avaliable as well although I had gone straight from showering at the hotel. This was my first Khmer massage and now I am already thinking about going back tomorrow evening before I leave Siem Reap. Thanks Lemongrass spa."

After a long day visiting the temples a massage is the perfect way to unwind before dinner. I chose the Lemongrass after reading the reviews on Tripadvisor and the great reviews were accurate. My husband had a 90 min aromatherapy massage and I had an hour Khmer massage and pedi. The girl did such a fantastic job on my pedi that when she asked if I wanted the mani too I couldn't say no. The layout of the spa is professional and peaceful I enjoyed the atmosphere. The staff is curteous and provide fantastic service for what I consider a low price. Yes, you could probably find lower places but you are trading quality for a small monetary saving. My only regret is that we didn't go there the first night we were in town so I could get one of the other many services they offer at the spa. I would visit again if ever in Siem Reap."

            "review": "Great massage - close to perfection.... I chose Lemongrass after reviewing several places on Tripadvisor, and wasn't disappointed. We visited the 'original' branch (not the one near KFC) and really liked it. A minor pain is having to pay a small deposit in person to book a treatment in advance. This is downright inconvenient, although I see the business rationale.First impressions are positive - the entryway is pleasantly decorated and smells just as it should, and the ginger tea is a nice touch. We opted for a 90 minute deep tissue massage because we both like firm massage, and the ladies we had were brilliant - very skilled and rhythmic, and using the right amount of pressure that was both strong and relaxing at the same time. It's worth noting here that Khmer massage is very different from Thai massage - there's no artery compression, deep digging, back walking, stretching, torso twisting or neck cracking - Khmer massage is much more about kneading, stroking and rolling, which we liked. We were so satisfied with our massages that we came back again for the same treatment, as well as a pedicure each. As a man, I do enjoy the occasional pedicure, and this was an extra $6 well spent.There are however a couple of things which would improve this place. Price aside, which I thought was high ($27 each for a 90 min massage is steep for this part of the world), the oil used for the massage is just plain - no aromatics, no scent. For the price, Lemongrass should at least use scented oils. And, although the massage rooms are fine, they do feel a bit dark and dingy and could do with being prettied up a bit. Also, because of the heavy oiling, it's quite uncomfortable to get dressed again afterwards, and then to go out into the heat of the street - I'd prefer to be given some hot towels to rub myself clean with, or for the therapists to do that at the end. Having a shower would be a helpful facility for this purpose, but alas not.So, you will undoubtedly get a great massage here, albeit without some of the niceties that would make it truly 5/5."

I persuaded my other half to indulge in a massage too and he was kinda reluctant as he hasn't enjoyed massages very much in the past.

The decor of the spa is nice enough, though the entrance area is probably the nicest vs. the actual rooms!The room was a little too cold and unfortunately, because it was near to a bar, there was still some music from the bar blaring through the windows. One thing to note is to make a reservation, they required a deposit. We didn't feel comfortable with this as we wanted flexibility, esp with timing etc. Although we ended up coming back anyway for the appointment, it's a little strange given how many spas there are in the area that they require a deposit...and they definitely had availability when we showed up."

Once I filled out the form indicating which areas of my body to avoid & which ones to spend extra time on, I'm lead to another room to have my feet washed. I am then taken upstairs where I leave my bag & shoes in a locker. I'm given a cotton shirt & tie on 3/4 pants to change into. Once changed I let my masseuse know that I'm ready & she tells me how she would like me to lie on the table. From there it's one hour of blissful deep tissue massage. You can specify the intensity of your massage if you don't enjoy deep tissue massage.The girls are very professional & the atmosphere is relaxing. Don't go in expecting the lavish surroundings you would see in western culture, but you can expect a top class massage in nice surroundings.I had a cheap street side foot & leg massage a couple of days before Lemongrass but it was not a good experience. The girls talk to each other for the duration & are more interested in what's going on outside than your level of comfort. I would recommend spending a little bit extra to experience Lemongrass. Ask any tuk tuk driver to drop you at KFC. It's about 3 shops down from there."

We were a bit surprised by this abrupt end and started to dress up until they came back five minutes later with special cushions for head massage!Be aware that for the body scrub, if you accept to get \"your belly\" massaged, your masseuse won't covered your breasts with a towel!I strongly recommend this place and will come back soon!"

You are coming after long-day spend on the tour, and they welcome you with a refreshing drink, also help you release pressure by refreshing your feet and cold-wet towel for your face and hands. Massage takes either 60-90 minutes, which depends on your will how long you want to spend. They can put you in the separate room with your 'other half' which gives massage more privacy, providing shower after the massage, I found it very nice, because i was sweating like a 'pig' after the floating village tour. Massage is 100% professional, so this is must try thing,plus its a win-win deal."

My therapist greeted me and took me upstairs to a room where there were 4 chairs....she asked me about the toe polish I would like. I advised her that I had changed my mind. She washed my feet and then excused herself. Some time later a younger therapist came in and sat down and began my foot massage. it was good however she kept turning around to look at the clock! We couldn't communicate. for the head massage she laid the bed flat and sat behind me. If you are looking for relaxation then this is not it. The massage consisted of circling thumbs very strongly followed by scratching of the scalp. I would view it as therapeutic.I was the only person having a treatment at the spa. I suspect the older therapist couldn't be bothered continuing my treatment in favour of watching the TV out the back with the other therapists, so sent a junior therapist in her place who said barely a word. Not very professional."

Plus, some of the other places look dodgy.The staff here are extremely professional, always making sure that they are not applying too much pressure and that you are feeling comfortable. For a Khmer massage, you can ask the staff to do extra work on certain areas of your body where you suffer from more aches/pains.

However, I have to give them full points on management and honesty...my husband forgot to collect his gold chain and watch when we left and we only realised it after about an hour...when we went back we found it neatly tagged and kept in their locker..."

You are greeted with a cool lemongrass tea which is very refreshing after coming in from the heat and humidity outside. My husband had a 1hr massage for $10 which he enjoyed and thought was great value. I had a. pedicure and manicure with colour for $15. I was thrilled ad I pay four times that at home. We finished with a cup of tea. Overall a teLly pleasant experience by a professional establishment. Well worth it."

It has a small frontage but three levels so don't be fooled by it's outward appearance. The same can be said for the Khmer masseuses that expertly attend to your weary muscles from traveling and exploring. There are various other treatments available but my driving point is a damn good massage. One point I must make though is that the Tuk Tuk drivers feign ignorance over the location of Lemongrass Garden as they don't get kick backs from the Spa's English and Khmer proprieters. Just stick close to the southern end of Street 8 where it is Pub St no longer. It's on the left hand side of Sivatha Rd or opposite Street 8 just keep Pub Street behind you. That aside the Healing Touch massage was brilliant as were the other treatments I recieved over the four days I was in Siem Reap. I will tell all that I know of Lemongrass Garden if they are to venture into this part of the world."

We have infact tried massage in Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, China, Malaysia, etc... The staff in Lemongrass were friendly and polite. The spa was clean. The massage room was clean, tidy and quiet although some drum beating was heard in 1 occasion but only last for about 4 to 5 minutes.( I was there 2 Xs ) The toilets were clean and neat, although my wife found a dead cockcroache in the lower level toilet. But not a big issue here as insects are all around in every country. Due to the extreme hot weather in Siem Reap, maybe the room temperature can be lower by 1 or 2 degree, that will be perfect. Luckily, there was a fan in the room. Both of us requested for \"Deep Tissue\" massage. As this is very individual preferences, to me and my wife, skill were good, sufficient strength applied during the massage. Even though I gave the full rating of \"Excellent\", however, I always believed there is room to improve. Eg, it was very impressive to know that there was a paper with human figure on it that customer can indicate their preferences area to be avoided or concentrate. Unfortunately, it was not put to good use. Price wise, I would not say \"Cheap\" if compare to Bangkok, China, etc.. I would say \"Reasonable\". Below are my individual ratings;Environment: 9/10Staff: 9/10Cleanliness: 9/10Massage skill: 9/10Price: 8/10"

The staff are friendly and professional, the massage area is spotless, with nice soothing music. The masseur was very attentive and was always asking if I was o.k. and if I wanted the massage harder or softer. I really appreciated this as I have been to many other places in town and have come out with bruises or it was so soft it felt like I was never massaged at all. I returned to Lemongrass for more treatments as I was confident I would get a great massage, and I know I would leave happy and feeling great. Was not disappointed!"

Having never tried Bael before we loved it and are now trying to find it here in NZ.We visited about four times during our stay and loved it every time The customer service is excellent and you really do feel removed from the buzz of being on the streets of Siem Reap.We did not mind paying a little bit more to be treated so well.I would strongly recommend that you take the time to visit and indulge yourself. We spent some time speaking with the owners and they explained how the staff are paid, this gave us more confidence that the staff were receiving their fair share of the money we were paying.

When I first entered, I was pleasantly surprised that I was greeted by the smell of lemongrass. The attention to detail in this spa is amazing! The prices were reasonable and the service was top notch. I'm a little sad that I fell asleep during my treatments since I wanted to savor the experience, but I really couldn't help myself! They have several floors of treatment rooms and the two I went to were nicely appointed and comfy. I'm a huge beauty/spa junkie and I say its a go.

That said, Lemongrass Garden is the only one that I've returned to more than twice. (In fact, I try and swing by every few weeks - or at least every time I'm suffering from a tennis injury!) There are several reasons for that: the professional masseuses, the relaxing environment, the complimentary tea, the stellar service (there's the option to choose where you would/wouldn't like to be massaged beforehand). Two factors remain more prominent than others, though. First, there's the acceptance of criticism on the part of the spa's owners - they're not just open to customer feedback (whether positive or negative), they actively strive to make changes if/where need be as a result. In a town full to the brim with massage parlours striving to make a quick and easy buck off exhausted travellers, Lemongrass Garden's commitment to the age-old adage of \"the customer's always right\" is as refreshing as it is admirable. Second, and perhaps most of important of all, is the quality of the massage itself. A treatment from Lemongrass Garden is the most consistently reliable (and by that, I mean reliably great) massage in town: bar none. Highly recommended to all."

What i received was a basic oil rub with very little penetration. For the $18 paid it was a poor experience overall. Firstly I was amused by the fact that the lady that was treating me gave me the complimentary knickers to put on but pretty much pulled them right down before she proceeded, hopped on the table and straddle over my back. Here we go! was my first thought. Then she just rubbed oil over my back pretty much. She asked if i was ok, like she was rubbing too hard, but i asked to go harder. At one stage she did go a little harder for about 2-3 minutes but that seemed to be all she had in her. Anyway - it was relaxing if nothing else, but overpriced for $18. i could have had a two hour massage for same closer to my hotel. The owner was sitting dowstairs when i finished and asked me for feedback. He was very disappointed and apologetic, but not enough to give me a discount or not charge at all? Being my third visit to Siem Reap I had not expected the massage to be like at home, but dont put deep tissue on a menu unless there is a least some penetration. I suggest the owner needs to be treated by his treaters to be sure they can do it before they treat customers. They might be better at some of the other offerings and i do point out that my rating is only for the 'deep tissue massage'"

            "review": "Dependable... prices not that cheap though!. I hesitate to give a slightly negative review of Lemongrass, particularly in view of the enthusiastic replies of staff to these reviews. Lemongrass straddles the middle ground between dirt-cheap massages costing a few US dollars, and luxury ones almost at European prices. In this respect, it largely does succeed. The place is clean, the ambience is quite nice and the staff are professional. I really wanted to love it more, but I didn't.I had a body scrub and a massage. The therapist was good but during the body scrub, left the treatment room for several periods (which could well be normal). The problem is that she left the door ajar on two of these occasions and someone walked in by accident on one occasion. I was covered up so no harm was done! I didn't mention it as I think she still did quite a good job and it is relatively insignificant.The problem is, the prices charged by Lemongrass (which they do not publish in detail online) are not a sufficient departure from those charged by some of the top spas for me to justify going there instead. Sure, the one-hour Khmer massage is only $10 USD but every other one-hour massage is more than twice that price (at least $25 USD but am more than happy to be corrected if I am wrong). It would also be helpful if they would publish their prices on leaflets or online so that customers could have an idea of detailed pricing before attending the spa (although I guess you could always call!)Overall, it is a solid dependable spa, but I would say it is worth paying a few extra dollars (or in some cases the same price) to go to a top-end spa and get the full luxury experience!"

The prices were very reasonable, however, due to the slow e-mail response (over 24 hrs), I was unable to do the spa package as I actually wanted to. I ended up going on the last day of my trip for a pedicure. The pedicure was great as was the entire spa atmosphere.

Whilst my girlfriend was having her massage I was using there free WiFi to catch up with friends back home, unfortunately the whole of Siem Reap had a power-cut 30 minutes though her massage. With the outside temperature at 40C it soon started to heat up so Dan the Manger asked if she would like it later on, we agreed as it would be too hot. Dan then invited us to go swimming at a local 5 star hotel with the staff as he was closing shop because of the power-cut, we tagged along and had a fantastic time!The next morning we had a flight to catch and had to be at the airport at 12pm, so he opened up the shop up early just for us! Cannot beat that for customer service!We wish Dan & his wife all the best for the future and would recommend others to visit here 5 Stars."

When you walk inside the Spa reception is clean, professional and smells lovely.You are given a menu and a lovely lemongrass drink and cold towel whilst you decide on what you want. We went for the foot massage on the first occasion and full body massage on the second occasion. Both treatments were excellent and delivered by lovely staff.I went with my husband and we had both treatments together.The facilities are great even the public toilets are clean and well kept.Prices are also so reasonable a foot massage was about \u00a35 and a full body massage \u00a310-15 for an hour!Definitely one to visit and so much more better value than what the hotel spas offer."

Most of the massage places in Siem Reap are cheap (starting at USD1.00) but I am hesitant to try them because I'm not convinced that I'll be assured of the cleanliness or getting quality massage.

At first I was iffy since I usually get massages from women but he was very professional while delivering the service and made me comfortable the entire time. The massage is slow and relaxing unlike one I had at another spa where it is quite hurried. I commend the ambiance and I can see that the beds are cleaned on a regular basis (again, unlike on the other spa I tried).The receiving area smells sooo good! And they serve tea before and after the service. Although I didn't drink mine because I don't drink teas (I'm a coffee person). But I appreciate the gesture of serving me tea just the same. I highly recommend this place for those who want to relax amid the hustle and bustle of the city. :)"

Before my massages I was given a cold tea and after the massages hot tea was served. I did tell the owner that I would move to Siem Reap to have access to Lemongrass. The prices are maybe a bit higher than other places but the cleanliness and ambiance are worth more than what they charge. $15.00 for a 90 min massage is definatly not unreasonable.

Spa is a great vibe, clean, comfortable and good use of essential oils. Value is very good. Perfect thing to do after a long day of temple exploring."

When I asked the reception why the 4 hand is more than doubled, he claimed that its because its synchronized massage by 2 massuer and hence i decided to give it a try.I was disspointed as i felt that it was not co-ordinated. In addition, the place was very hot. The aircon is not strong and hence made the experienced worst."

            "review": "Very professional massage place. This massage place was recommended to me by my Guesthouse, and a good tip it was nice. As soon you enter you realise that this is a very professional business with a personal touch. You get a tea before the massage, before your feet are washed. I chosen the 60 min Khmer massage twice, and you are lead to a room with a number of beds, quite relaxing music playing, some scent candles burning. The beds are sperated by curtains to give you some privacy. You are then asked to use the provided khmer shorts and shirt, and then the massage starts.I had in total two massages there, and the first one wasabsolute perfect. I think I fell asleep during the massage as it was so relaxing. Especially after a long day visiting temple it feels just great. The second massage was not as nice, as it was in my opinion to strong, and a bit painful. Maybe I should have told her that...but didnt want to be seen as rude.After the massage you get another tea while filling in a feedback form, as they are clearly keen to know how you enjoyed it.Yes, it is more expensive than other places in Siem Reap, but in my opinion it is worthwhile to spend more due to the professional set up. Would highly recommend the place, as the first massage was the best one I ever had."

When we got there they gave us paper to fill out which part of body we are sore so they can work on those spot more. At 1st I was impress so my expectation got even higher. Unfortunately to our disapointment this paper was no even used at all! what a joke! Our masseuse seems either really tire or not know what to do as she kept working on the same spot. I pay for deep tissue oil massage but that was hardly deep tissue, she didn't put any pressure at all. It felt like she was just rubbing oil on my body My family members all had the similar bad experience. I wouldn't recommended spending more money for this place! I had the $5 massage at another place and they have done much better job than this."

My girlfriend and I went for the first time last night and each had a one-hour oil massage ($12 or $13, I forgot exactly). We went back again tonight, this time both having a one-hour deep tissue oil massage ($15 each).\u00a0You can certainly get a cheaper massage nearby but I doubt it will come close to the quality at Lemongrass. From the moment I walked in, it was an obvious this was a quality establishment. Artful decor, relaxing music and above all, very clean. A massage is about the experience, right?The service was impeccable: I was particularly impressed when we were given slips of paper with diagrams of a person (front and back) so I could indicate any problem areas (in my case, neck and shoulders - the curse of the office drone!).\u00a0Other lovely little touches included the cold lemongrass tea on entry (nice tie-in) and the hot tea afterwards. The fact they also gave us feedback cards at the end suggests the owners take customer service seriously. \u00a0Both massages were spot on. Another reviewer here on Tripadvisor has made negative comparisons to Thai massage - this is definitely a different style to the clamber-all-over-you Thai style. It's much more a relaxing rub-down (the deep tissue was tough at times but not gritted-teeth painful).\u00a0I actually have been carrying a low-grade strain in my neck and traps over the past few weeks. It was particularly troublesome on the hellish bus ride from Phonm Penh to Siem Reap. Since my massages, it has all but disappeared.\u00a0Price wise, there are loads of other, cheaper options around. It all depends how attached you are to each single dollar. Case in point: there was a French girl sitting beside me in the reception area at Lemongrass who asked for the standard Khmer massage (one hour, $8). When the ever-so-polite clerk asked if she wanted oil for $4 or $5 extra, she declined. Personally, I'd recommend paying extra and getting the ideal massage, not the cheapest. Then again, my backpacker days are behind me, so a few extra dollars premium here and there are no bother.\u00a0To sum up: highly recommended. If I wasn't leaving Siem Reap tomorrow lunchtime, if definitely be going back. Pure holiday pampering.\u00a0"

I was disappointed the first time with the foot massage as it was just mediocre compared to others I'd had in town, but was about three times the price ($8 compared to $3 elsewhere). The ambiance was somewhat nicer though, so I decided to give it another shot and went back the next day for a body massage. The body massage was similarly disappointing, just kind of weak and lacking in technique. I asked for a bit stronger of a massage but it didn't even seem like the masseuse attempted to do so. Overall, I didn't really see the place providing anything better than others in the area, aside from slightly nicer ambiance and much higher prices."

The welcome was really nice and we decided to do 1h deep tissue and 30min head massage for 15$ and 6$.The staff was lovely and the massage relaxing, not the best but good. Unfortunetly what spoiled our experience is that it was noisy by time and kept falling asleep and awake by people, doors or even someone shouting at once. It annoyed me in the way that you go to spa for the relaxing part as normal massage place they would talk etc.This part make you feel that it's overprice for the ambiance, unfortunetly on top of that, and I know it is still good value and prices but our massage finish 10min earlier knowing that in between the deep tissue the staff went out for at least 5min. It is only 15min but you would want your massage to go to the end.On the massage quality itself I would have gone again but our personal experience today made us feel that we could find better relaxing place."

To cap off the whole experience, my real black havianas slippers (not bought from the local market mind you) which I placed inside the shelf provided outside the spa was missing.

The place is clean, welcome drinks were served. Going through the menu, we were amazed with the 4 hands massage, something we've never heard before. Only to be explained of having 2 masseur at the same time!!! The price tag is US$18 and all 4 of us selected this option!Imagine in the room for the 4 of us with 8 masseur!!! A total of 12 people !!!! HahahahaThe massage was fantastic, one of the masseur massaging the lower body while the other one taking care of the top body. Never experience this before.Masseurs were very professional, they did not utter a single word while we were enjoying the massage with the soothing musical.The only setback was the washroom! Before the massage, we wanted to use the restroom but was informed that there was water supply disruption. Nevertheless they stored some water for our use. Off course this is not within their control.Overall:- all the 4 of us enjoyed the massage (with one friend snoring towards the end)- value for money- well locatedWe left the Lemongrass being happy and refreshed! Will recommend it to friends.Btw, they have a 10-hands massage as well. Can imagine how pack the room is for this selection!!!"

As a runner, I get pretty tight and as a lazy runner, I like the enforced stretching of Asian massage. Thai is generally my preference, but Khmer comes a close second. I sussed the scene in Siem Reap shortly after arriving and basically had it divided into expensive day spas and budget massage shops. You could pay $4 for a massage or $30. Then I found Lemongrass. As soon as we walked in the door, it was apparent that this place was a professionally run place. A smiling, well spoken receptionist welcomed us and provided a list of treatments available. A cool scented face towel and chilled green tea were served and then we were shown to the feet washing place. The feet washing earns a big thumbs up from me. The budget places usually forget to wash your feet or just rub a wet towel over them after you've already changed into your massage costume. Anyway, this was a nice touch. We were then shown to a room with comfortable temperature and nice lighting. The clothes we were given to change into were comfortable and the massage mat was just right. The massage itself was firm, but not painful. I could say that I have had physically more effective massages, but I could say that I have had few other massages that were so relaxing and thoroughly enjoyable. The therapist was consistent and sensitive to a few painful spots. I could feel that she was concentrating carefully on what she was doing and no one area was neglected in favor of another. I liked the small details such as draping a small folded towel over my eyes when I lay on my back so as to avoid the lights. Also, washing hands before massaging the head is important and this was done. At the conclusion of the massage we had a pleasant chat with Ms. Borei, the owner and met her charing young son who helped us to change our shoes. My partner said that her oil massage was superb. So superb in fact that she fell asleep and was in semi sleep all the way back to the room. In summary I would say that this place is terrific value for money. At less than half the price than Bodia Spa or Bodytune, this place provides a terrific massage in a very professional environment. Highly recommended."

I have to say I preferred this to the Thai massage I had last week (elsewhere). I found Thai massage to hurt too much - just my own personal preference. At Lemongrass, the masseur was still firm though and if it got a bit painful he told me to tell him and he softened his touch.Unlike the other massage place I went to, Lemongrass is much quieter and thus more relaxing. The rooms are set off a central stairwell and it's very quiet once you're in there - just you and the relaxing music.It also smells lovely - from the moment you walk in, to the oil used in your treatment. You get free tea too.To sum, Lemongrass give great massages, the place is lovely and relaxing, and the price is more than reasonable.Definitely going back!"

You may not notice because instead of leaving their staff outside to yell \"Massage siiiir?\" in your face, they are inside waiting to give actual, professional massages. I walked by it a couple of times until I finally met Dan, part owner with his girlfriend, at a nearby store and we got to talking and he told me about his trained masseuses. He even invited me to just go in and look at the menu and score some free tea and a face towel, which every visitor gets when they enter. Everyone at Lemongrass is extremely welcoming, and that is a huge plus when you are getting a personal service like a massage. Definitely worth the extra $3 above the going street price.The next day I ordered a massage, but Borey, the owner, called it a \"Treatment.\" I see why now. First they relax you with some great exotic tea and a foot wash in a comfy chair. After that is the massage, which was perfect. When I asked for it to be stronger, the masseuse actually listened. She was clearly trained and knew what she was doing. The decor and the atmosphere is all so peaceful that it's hard not to unwind. Finally, after the massage, they invite you for more tea downstairs to continue to cool off.Actually, after my massage, Dan invited me upstairs to their soon-to-be-open lounge for a beer and some tea. Again his welcoming invitation to just hang out added to my relaxation. The lounge was just as peaceful as the rest of the building and has a great view of the commotion that is bar street. It's the perfect place to watch Siem Reap nightlife and yet know you are safe from the tuk tuk requests and general craziness.The only complaint I had was that no one asked if there were specific places I wanted extra attention during the massage. But it wasn't a big deal since the massage was great overall. I'm sure I could have asked if I really needed something.Skip all the fake massages and head straight to Lemongrass if you want to actually feel good and know you spent your money well when you leave!"

I get my regular massage almost weekly, and have experienced variety of qualities and Lemongrass Garden is one amongst the top.Anyway I ask for a 90minutes service which cost USD 23 (60min cost USD 16). I got to the place around 4.45pm, got the massage, and then took a shower after the massage. There was no clock on the room, so I wasn't aware of the time. After the massage, I went to join my husband for dinner around pub st area and just realised that it was only 6pm. This means the massage that I got was less than 60mins (since I also took a shower at least 5-10 mins) and I paid full price of USD 23 for a 90 mins service.I started to play back what had happened, how come the guy receptionist did not manage to keep the time and informed me of the mistake. Then I remember when I was about to pay, the receptionist was having a frown and murmuring something in Cambodian with the therapist. He then handed me a bill folder with 2 bills inside, 1 for USD 23 and 1 for USD 16. He then explained to me that I asked for a 90 mins service = USD 23, I asked what was the other bill for, and he replied unclearly which I took was 'it's a bill for another customer' So I paid USD 23 and gave tip to the therapist and left.It is sad that such dishonesty ruined the great experience. Word of advise for future customer, do watch the time when you start and finish the massage to avoid my bad experience."

Upon entering, I was greeted by a friendly and welcoming staff. The manageress spoke perfect English and described to me the large variety of specialized massages, from a Khmer massage to the Spiritual Healing massages. The venue is clean, well maintained and I was extremely happy there was aircon! After an hour massage, I felt great and very well looked after, and, topped off with a cup of local tea, I was VERY happy. A great end to the perfect day, I would recommend Lemongrass Spa to anyone visiting Siem Reap. And the prices are CHEAP!"

The talented and friendly staff were sweet, and incredibly attentive.Treating us like royalty from the moment we entered.It was so great infact that I returned a week later with my spouse so he too could experience the luxurious massage.

The nailfiles were way to coarse too and there was no shaping of the nails. The nailpolishing was not very nice either unfortunately, full of bubbles and stripes and had to come off as soon as we got back to the hotel. Not recommended for pedicures but might still be great for massages!"

It's very serene the moment you step in, whereas other smaller places feel a bit cramped and you're rushed in and out of your treatment, here you're greeted with an organic health drink on your arrival and a floral foot bath before your treatment and they are professional, taking time to check what areas you want worked on/avoided. I had an excellent facial using the spas own products, which are chemical free and had a great effect on my skin (I bought some afterwards!) I also went with my partner to do one of the 'couples packages' it was $55 each for about 2.5hrs (herbal steam, massage and a body wrap.) After the treatment you're brought jasmine tea with homemade cookies and can relax in the waiting room, rather than being rushed back out onto the manic streets, so that was a big plus too!"

A little background to make this clearer- I've never had a foot massage before, or spent much time at spas, so I was a little uncomfortable about the idea. I also can't really speak with expertise about price, though my friend tells me that all spas in Cambodia are relatively very cheap, compared to similar service in the US. Here, the staff were welcoming and made me feel pretty comfortable.The woman who gave me the foot massage was named Chittra, and she was very friendly and seemed to know just what she was doing. She didn't know what was in the lotion she was using, but it smelled a little citrusy, perhaps orange-scented. The whole place was very cool and clean, relaxing, and after the massage, they gave us each a cup of tea, which was very nice. Overall, I enjoyed it."

Package was $55 USD but because we had done some shopping at the store next door they gave us 10% off. Total time was 2.5 hours of bliss.Really really recommend this place if you are looking for a quality spa that won't break the bank and is so cheap compared to what you would pay for a spa of its kind back in your home country. The products are all made in Cambodia and are all natural."

Perhaps due to low season. Anyway due to this they cut the price down to 50usd and then further discounted us 10%. They also appered to be having problems with the spoong machine - apparently a traftional steam treatement, so instead they offered us the option of a facial, mani or pedi.we went for yhr facial. In total our treatment went for 3hours, we started with refreshments and finished with tea. I reccommned going here as they use locally sourced products so you kind if are supporting a whole bunch of local business.

I'll try to be a bit more specific, as to be helpful (trying to improve my reviewing skills ;). Atmosphere: 5/5 wonderful: sparse, calming music; clean, minimalist space with fresh lotus flowers and water theme throughout. Overall Service: 5/5 Professional, friendly. I often find it less relaxing when a service is provided while chatting with coworkers. The aesthetician and I were alone during the massage and mani/pedi. I chose the $20 man/pedi. This is by far one of the most quality/thorough mani/pedis I've received (including in the US). I'm particular about my cuticles. I chose the 90 minute massage with oil. I was asked about pressure. I requested less large rubbing strokes and more localized, firm pressure. She was receptive. Although it wasn't the most amazing massage I've ever had: I generally get 2 pricey massages a month on a regular basis from a physical therapist - the overall experience was so enjoyable and affordable that complaining would be splitting hairs a bit. Service largely depends on the individual providing it, but this spa was professional and very quality. I would certainly return with confidence in whomever would be providing services. Also, I did not find the smell of the oils at all overwhelming, and I am sensitive to fragrances. Their cafe next door is fantastic as well. I only wish I had found all of this just a day earlier!"

I highly recommend this spa for its unbeatable price (it's almost 50% cheaper than our 5-star hotel spa) and ambience.I had the following done on the different days during my Siem Reap stay:- Foot Reflexology - Deep Renewal Massage- Khmer MassageAll are 90 mins each.The Deep Renewal Masage was amazing. You are first led to a room with a lovely bathroom for a little shower (if you like). Products used are all organic. The owner also owns the amazing Senteurs Workshop (you can visit this workshop for free after your spa massage). The therapist who did my massage was so amazing and humble. I was off to slumberland soon after. 90 mins Massage - US$36- I then did the Khmer Massage on the day after I've conquered Angkor Wat and the Angkor Thom temples. My body and feet were aching so bad, I felt like an old lady. Came here for the Khmer Massage and Foot Reflex. OMG, my therapist (it was another therapist) did such a rad job on me....that by the time she was finished with me - my bones and body weren't aching any longer! I felt rejuvenated!! Her Khmer Massage (90 mins) was soooo professionally done that I did not feel any pain...but instead was so relaxing! She knew how to stretch my limbs and hands without hurting me. Cost for 90 mins - US$29. SO WORTH IT!!I also had a luxury manicure and pedicure done (they use OPI products) and again, it was so well done. My nails (hand and feet) were dried by the time she was finish with me - 2 hours later. Would I recommend you to come here? Hell yeah!! Your hotel concierge will be able to tell your tuk tuk driver to bring you here.Kaya Spa is located next door to Kaya Cafe (another place where you can sip coffee and have a nice meal whilst waiting for your spa appointment). That was what I did when I tried to come here one day without an appointment.So... this place is always packed. You MUST make a prior appointment before coming here lest you'd be sorry! What I did was to email Kaya Spa and Cafe via their Facebook page. Then give them the dates/timings that you'd like to visit.Overall Rating for Kaya Spa: 9/10Rating for Kaya Spa Therapists: 9/10 (all of them didn't disappoint)Rating for ambience: 9/10How to find Kaya Spa:They are located at the Old Market (Psar Chaa) and just 30 seconds away from the Blue Pumpkin (a cafe selling ice cream, cakes and pastries). It is also about 1 min walk away from Pub Street.There are other spa located along this stretch. They may be cheaper than Kaya Spa. But I wouldn't recommend you going for the cheap spa. You get what you pay for!I'm going back to Kaya Spa again tomorrow for my 90 mins Khmer Massage!"

Lovely setting, enjoyed the welcome tea and cool towel and the snack at the end. Nail treatment room is very relaxing with a full wall waterfall.Could do with improvement on the nail packages: (i) Luxury manicure was NOT value for money. I got the Express Pedicure (US$10) and the Luxury Manicure (US$18) at the same time. On the menu, the difference between the two is that the Luxury manicure is an extra 30 mins and you get moisturizer and a massage. But in reality the only difference was for the Luxury manicure was that they just drew out the time taken to paint the nail painting take a much longer time and the massage was an extra 2 minutes max.(ii) Neither Luxury or Express manicure included buffing, even though it was listed on the menu.I told the staff when I was paying the bill that I wasn\u2019t happy with these above items. Firstly they didn\u2019t know what \u2018buffing\u2019 meant. And for the complaint about the extra 2 minute massage costing me an extra US$8 they just said thank you for the feedback.So if you go there for nails, enjoy the ambience, but make sure you insist they give you buffing and make sure that massage that you are paying an extra US$8 for is longer than 2 minutes!"

Everything was perfect!I had a bad headache for a few days and the Ancient Khmer Massage, which releases pain, was so relaxing and helped me. My headache was gone after that massage, i was so glad and felt so good. My boyfriend got the Aromatherapy Massage and he was so happy with that too. We both said, this was the best massage, we have ever had! We would always come back to Kaya Spa, when we are in Siem Reap next time!After the Massage we enjoyed such a delicious dessert at the Kaya Caf\u00e9 and a fresh juice. The Senteurs Workshop is great too. We saw how they make their little boxes, the soaps, seasonings and body products.We can highly recommend Kaya Spa to everybody!!!"

Kaya Spa is a good balance between the typical massage places you would find in Siem Reap's Pub Street and the ultra high-end options available in hotels and more secluded areas in Pub Street.The ambiance is very peaceful and relaxing, and the service is very pleasant and efficient. They give you a delicious welcome drink that you enjoy while they wash your feet before entering the main area of treatment.They offer a variety of massages, scrubs, facials, etc. at very reasonable prices. The treatment rooms (can be singles or doubles) are clean and the in-room shower more than spacious. After my relaxing Khmer massage, I enjoyed a cup of tea and cookies. What I did not like about Kaya was the selection of massage oil blends (Khmer massage is dry but my friends opted for deep massages) was very strong and pervasive and can give you a headache. A lighter-scented option in their selection would be nice."

I wouldHighly recommend the $18.00 deluxe pedicure. In fact it was so good that I will be returning today to get an aromatherapy massage."

After having a rather terrible massage in our 5 star hotel we decided to venture out so I read all the reviews and decided on trying the Kaya Spa first and boy am I glad that we did!This was possibly one of the best massages that we have ever had. From the moment we walked in the place was amazing and the people lovely too.We both opted for the Candle massage as we have never tried this before and both ladies were incredible.We are definitely going back for more treatments. Yes, it's not the cheapest but it's cheaper than our hotel and definitely worth the fee.This place is a real gem. Well done Kaya Spa!(The cafe was really good too!)"

After walking through the temples under the sun, you will need some indulging time and Kaya will leave a nice impression on you. You first arrive to a welcome drink, and while seated you get to choose which services you are having. I opted for an \"amazing candle and oil massage\" and choose the refreshing essence and the express manicure. After 2 min I got greeted by my therapist, Ty who then cleaned my feet in a bowl with flowers and essence and prepared me to start the treatment. The room is private, very clean and beautiful. It also has a shower for you to use before and after your massage.Ty was amazing, probably the best massage I've gotten so far (in my life). I was sad I didn't book for 90 min. After, the same therapist took me to the manicure room. In Brazil we do a lot of manicures, and I usually have a very high standard for this kind of service. I don't think it was a bad manicure, but she was certainly a better at massages. They use a bowl of water with rose petals to make your cuticles softer, the bowl is quite big and hard to hold. For some unknown reason they also use a lime over it. Overall my experience at Kaya was amazing, I would come back here to have massages everyday if I could. Highly recommend it. "

After many massages in various places we decided to check out reviews and visit a more upscale spa for a mani/pedi treatment. We chose the \"Luxury\" package that stated we would get leg and arm treatments along with our mani/pedis. After arriving in a lovely reception area we were walked upstairs to a small and dark brick room and put in foot massage chairs. The pedis were first and were just \"ok\". The manis were done in the most primitive set up I've ever experienced. I had to hold a bowl of water on my lap as the treatment went on, she did not move from side to side of my chair. I had to cross my chest and hold my hand out for her. The final look was like a six year old had done the job!! My daughters' manicurist cut her cuticle beds in two places and then put a lime on it!! Obviously it stung and she wanted OUT. I cannot recommend this place for these treatments. Hopefully, the massages are better. But please beware..!"

The premises are well done, tasteful with minimalistic design with private shower in each room, which is nice. But the massage was a let down it was like a Thai massage but not even comparable with treatments we received in Thailand never the less it was ok. The real disappointment came with the mani & pedicure. They do the treatment in a dark room with no natural light and the therapists had to fight for the lights so they can see what they do. Having had the same treatment in many spas in various countries I can say that the staff clearly didn't receive professional training. The 'highlight' of the experience was when the therapist didn't know how to remove the Gel colour from my fianc\u00e9s nails. After small discussion with the other therapist tried to remove them by force. So we had to explain the process. Eventually we left the spa with the gel still partially intact. They asked us to fill out a questioner about our service at the end. When they read out comments they didn't even bother investigate our experience. The therapists were nice and tried to do their best. Shame that the management don't care about them by providing them proper training."

This is at the pricier end for Siem Reap, but a thousand fold good value compared to the $3 foot massages on offer on every street.For the details: if, like me, you get a little self conscious clomping around in spas, rest easy. The experience began with a reverent foot wash, then a shower in a private room ensuite (bear in mind I was there for a facial!), then pure bliss. Special mention to my masseuse, Mao, firm hands and gentle manner.Whole thing wrapped up with an opportunity for another shower if wanted, followed by hot tea. At no point was anything rushed. Unexpected bonus, whilst I was there I believe I overheard the French owner discussing staff training and development with the manager. If I overheard correctly, it was a level of care and diligence which reflects the ambience of the whole place. Bravo; would definitely go again.Cons: Only one \"mark down\", namely that shampoo in the shower would have been nice, though this is an extremely picky complaint as the shower itself was a bonus."

The giant shower allowed you to wash off any residue of the day and made sure you were in the right frame of mind even before the treatment started.After having numerous massages throughout our trip, this one was the first one to really scratch my muscle relieving itch.

I asked to see the room before booking and loved the simple but elegant set up. But i really loved that each room had a huge shower and bathroom.The spa menu also explained the protocols of the spa, what to wear etc - which can always be a bit embarrasing for a male when there are language issues.So my wife and I arrive for seperate Aromatherapy 1 hour massages.1. Select your fragrance - choice of 4 or 52. Move to the foot washing area where your therapist proceeds to bathe your feet in warm water with lotus flower petals in it.3. Your feet are then beautifully hand scrubbed with the spa's own salt treatment - heaven.4. Rinse, dried and then placed in beautiful white sponge like slippers.5. Off to your private room where you are given the choice to have a shower whilst the therapist leaves the room. Check out the size of the shower rose (head) your mad to decline!!!!6. Therapist returns for wonderful massage therapy.7. Option to shower again at conclusion - didn't have to be asked twice!!!8. Change and return to waiting area for herbal tea and some small biscuits.9. Watch the smile on my wifes face as she emerged from pure Bliss.The foot bath and scrub alone was brilliant.Ive had quite a few spa visits on this trip, but returned twice to Kaya and haven't had one since. I simply don't want to be let down by some other spa not matching this experience. If they don't bathe feet first then your no longer at the required standard. I'm back in Siem Reap in a few weeks so don't book them out. I have time for one more.I asked for Kaya to be added to trip Advisor - it seemed the least i could do after such a great experience"

The prices were relatively high for Cambodia, but was justifiable - the spa was gorgeous, and also very very clean. You are greeted with water and a cold towel, and change out your shoes for spa slippers. Ratanak did my pedi, and she was meticulous about it...I'd say it took over an hour of bliss, and my toes looked wonderful. My friend said her massage was also very good - closer to a Thai reflexology massage than a Western/Swedish massage - but excellent. Would go back.

The ambience is very peaceful, there is nice, spa music in the background, and the temperature is perfect (or you can ask them to adjust the AC).The massage is professional, and based on your feedback, it can be strong, medium or gentle.

The Manicure was painful - she had to say three times that it hurt. The manicure was only about 20 minutes and was supposed to be 45. The quality of top coat was terrible, she'll have to redo her nails tomorrow. (Pedicure was okay she said.)My four hand massage was strange. One masseuse was good, the other was absolutely terrible. It made for a very strange experience. For the money, this was not a good deal."

Your feet are washed and you're provided with flip flops (which i despise) and shown to your room, you're then given time to undress in privacy and then they come in and preform the massage. they ensure through out that they are not causing you any discomfort and they did a very good job. i was very happy with my experience!"

I had asked her to avoid the head, face and tummy but in the end, she skipped my shoulders and neck, squeezed my face and still short me about 10 minutes (while my husband was still in his massage). When my masseuse excused herself from the room, the other masseuse made a remark in their local language. This didn't stop my masseuse from leaving the room. We went there after a long day of walking around the temples and hoped to seek some relieve for our tired body but the experience was very disappointing. We both felt that the masseuses are only familiar with their routined massage and are treating us like materials on a conveyor belt without quality control."

If you go to Siam Reap and don't take advantage of the price and quality of the massage you will regret it.The amount you pay here compared to every other place is ridiculously low. Used TripAdvisor to decide on the quality and think I made the right choice. Did a full hour of the four hands massage and enjoyed every minute of it. I don't like the normal rubbing massages so I opted for the traditional Khmer and it was awesome. More like a light Thai massage with pressing and very light stretching rather than rubbing. My girlfriend and I both got the massage so we were in a room together with four masseuses. My only complaint was that they were talking loudly almost the entire time. Other than that it was a great time. The place is clean, comfortable, and the man working the front desk was friendly and helpful.Do not pass up this great opportunity for a great massage."

I have asked masseurs to stop a few minutes in on more than one occasion in Cambodia because they were so bad. This place was wonderful though.

My partner and I went to Lotus Spa based on all the good reviews and I got a brazilian wax and a mani/pedi and he got a massage. The mani/pedi and massage were fine, so this review is only about the waxing. Let me preface this by saying I have gotten waxed all over the world, and have done Brazilian waxes on myself countless times, so I've experienced a variety of techniques (and skill levels) and am not picky. This though was by far the worst wax I've ever had. I was waxed with drugstore style sticky strips that felt like tape, as in they stuck tightly to my hair AND skin. Never once was wax actually put directly on my skin. This was weird but not yet a total deal breaker for me. The biggest problem was that the girl didn't seem to know what she was doing. She would wax the same spot 5-10 times in a row, and because the strip ripped at my skin each time it became extremely painful. My hair was not too short nor very thick (I'd been waxed 5 weeks prior) but it took nearly FIFTY minutes until I finally told her we had to stop. Although usually I walk out of waxing appointments feeling fine, this time it looks like my lady bits were in a street fight. It is now hours later and I am still swollen and in a fair amount of pain with large bruises...everywhere. I was also left covered in sticky residue from the tape-like strips. I'm baffled as to how I had such an awful experience while other people rated it highly, but maybe the usual waxing lady wasn't there or they were training new staff??On the bright side the staff were all really nice, I just hope they never do this to anyone else."

We both had the 60 minute $10 Khmer massage. We were give a cold towel and water while they cleaned our feet and were given sandals. We were in a room together and given a light linen top and shorts to change into. The massage itself was more like a body rub massage as opposed to targeting muscles with harder pressure. For $10 it was great! There were other options available, so I'm sure one could find something they liked. After, they gave us some time to relax for a minute and change. We were give some tea back at reception. We gave a $5 tip to each masseuse. My lady was very appreciative! I would recommend it, but if you want more pressure, try something other than the Khmer massage."

Their service is comparable to hotel service. They served iced water and wet towel and wash your feet before you go for your massage. I chose Swedish massage with normal massage oil. But because I'm a lover for essential oil, the lady in charge gave me an option to choose for any essential oil that I want. Massage was really relaxing that I almost fall asleep.

She opted for 2 hour aromatherapy massage and I opted for 90 min aromatherapy massage and facial.Opting for the facial was a huge mistake - the mask was slopped on my face (including eye area) and wiped off repeatedly with a flannel. Then I had strips of cucumber on my face, over eyes as well, with the mask stuff slathered on cucumber (after I asked her to avoid eye area). I understand there are language differences but she just left the room in between, so I was left dithering whether to just take the product off (but didn't want to make a mess). My eyes were both really red after the facial. The massage was good though. A bit hard for me, but she did go softer when requested (several times). Nice clean place, I would recommend for massage."

The facilities to do pedicure is very basic. For example to dry your nails, they use a normal fan to do so. And I feel bad that the staff has to constantly bend her back to do my toes nails because the seat is not the usual-elevated seat convenient for pedicures. However, she was very meticulous and still did a pretty decent job. The nail polishes are not real OPI, but for the price I paid, I am not fussy over this. Her massage skill was also good and I fell asleep.If you are sick of the cheapo massage you can find in Pub street and wanted something a bit more luxury and air-conditioned, Lotus Dream Spa is the place to go. Only 2-3mins walk down from Pub Street."

A fabulous massage makes your soul sing.A massage at the Lotus Dream Spa is somewhere between great and fabulous. Occasionally giving massages myself and having received hundreds of them, I am really picky on what I like and don\u2019t like. You know how sometimes you get a massage and you sense the person isn't really there, that it's just 2 hands mechanically doing a sequence and you just feel like a lump of flesh? Or when the massage ladies start talking to each other and you are just waiting till it's over?Here at Lotus Dream Spa nothing like that. I was warmly welcomed with this genuine kindness that instantly goes to the heart. Offered a chilled glass of water and a small wet towel, you choose your massage program whilst someone is cleaning your feet. Already now you know you want to pamper yourself. I took a 1,5 hour full body Deep Tissue massage with scented essential oils. And generously treated myself to the same massage two days later. Standard packages start at 14$ I believe. The private rooms are impeccably clean and warmly decorated, with nice music on the background. (warning: the first time I was in a room on the street side with lots of traffic noise so try to get a room away from the street, which are most rooms) The massage tables are ..euh...real massage tables (and not some mattress on the floor), so perfect to lie on your belly with your head straight down. Then the real thing\u2026after some clear indications of my preference, never a strange twist or wrong pressure... being touched by such delicately moving hands, using all the right techniques...wonderful...So glad I felt my massage lady being present with me, for me. Returning to planet Earth from this short travel to another universe (yes, yes, I\u2019m still talking about massage only), I showered \u2013 at my pace \u2013 in the en-suite bathroom. Back at the reception, a glass of tea and a friendly chat helped to transit smoothly to \u2018the world out there\u2019. Smiling. Feeling good. Strong. Elevated. We all dream of these places and moments where we can feel safe, cared for and nourished. I was lucky to find The Lotus Dream Spa to be one of these places and perhaps you will be too. So be kind to yourself and book a massage here. You deserve it."

To top it off, the massage therapist was sneezing, coughing and sniffling the entire time and continually apologizing for doing so. When I spoke with reception about this, the response was \"oh I know, she will go home now.\" Ridiculous.

We selected this place because of its high satisfaction rating, the high number of reviews on Trip Advisor and reasonable prices. Their prices in Cambodia was mid range. (I have tried low between $6 foot massage and high $42 massage in different establishments.)After 2 full days of trekking, walking, hiking, we needed massages. We selected 90 minute neck, shoulder, back massage package, which also included reflexology. I specifically emphasized I need someone with strong hands. I know my muscles are tight. The front man told me no problem, just tell the lady. Well, my lady does not speak or understand English. Not only that, my lady seemed a last minute call in. She is inexperienced. Fortunately for her, I was sharing a room with my husband. My lady can follow my husband's massage lady's routine. Many times I have to tell her where to put pressure, but to no avail. She did not understand me, and she is following a set routine / program. The reflexology toward the end was useless. she just hold my toes, no pressure applied at all. I was so frustrated. 90 minutes later, I was more uptight than before the massage. Maybe I expected more because of the high Trip Advisor rating? However, both my husband and my sister thought their massages were decent. THe room amenities were alright. They wash your feet, provided towels and tea before massage. Good start. If you do go there, ask for someone with some experience."

We were in desperate need of a massage after a full day of touring the temples because that can really put a beating on your body, especially carrying around heavy cameras. We looked over the reviews and settled here since the only place above it was dedicated to a specific type of massage and we couldn't be happier with our choice. We booked an hour and a half massage for two of us with a 30-minute foot massage add-on and the total for both of us was $42. The massages were some of the best we've had anywhere and were ten times better than the jujitsu moves and submission holds put on us a few days ago in Myanmar. The location was clean, the staff was super friendly and the masseuses were amazing. The ladies knew exactly what they were doing and you could tell they were expertly-trained. If you need a massage in Siem Reap, look no further!"

I was angry that we waited until our last night in Siem Reap to have a massage at Lotus Dream Spa.We found this spa through TA. After reading several positive reviews, we booked our reservations for the traditional Khmer massage. A one-hour session was $10. Upon our arrival, we were welcomed with a glass of water. Also, our feet were washed. Afterwards, we were provided sandals to wear.The facility was clean. Our massage beds were quite plush and comfortable. There was music playing softly in the background. The atmosphere was very serene and calming. We were each provided a cotton shirt and pants for the massage.At the beginning, there was some quiet discussion between the masseuses but it lasted only a few minutes. The traditional Khmer massage was a great deep tissue massage. It seemed similar to a Thai massage. During the massage, my masseuse had to undo my bun in order to massage my scalp. Afterwards, she quickly styled my hair into a French braid. :-)After the massage, we were given a cup of hot tea. Rick, the owner, and his staff are very friendly and welcoming. I would love to have another massage here."

I'm not a massage expert, the Khmer massage felt like the Thai massages I got in Chiang Mai, so if you're like me, you should know the patterns feel similar. Still, the ladies at Lotus Dream Spa are professional, gauged their pressure depending on my comments or reaction, and gave a good, strong, stretching massage. We received ice cold waters and a towel on entering and hot tea before leaving.I also tried the full body oil massage, but I received more value out of the Khmer massage. A few things to improve is that I wish I got a table for my full body massage (they were all being used, wish they had more tables) and I wish they would've cleaned my feet before giving me sandals. Walking the Cambodian streets made my feet dusty and/or muddy, and maybe the person before me had dirty feet too."

In terms of areas of improvement, the 2 massage therapist applied different pressure/strength. Not a bad thing, but it felt slightly off kilter. Not an issue if you didn't go for the \"4-hands massage\", but I felt I had to try it at least once! Maybe instead of 2 therapist each working on one arm or on one leg, maybe one get work the leg muscles while the other does the back?? I'm splotting hairs at this point. Bottom line, the massage was fantastic, and I'm going to try to grab one more before I leave Siem Reap. Cheers!"

The shop is located just outside of the night market on a side street. Upon entering, the 2 story lobby is a very nice change from the small fronts that we are used to seeing. Lotus Dream Spa stood out because there were NO fish tanks and NO touting going on outside the building. The ladies at the desk were very quick to welcome us with a cold water and towel after picking our 1hr Khmer massages ($10USD each). We were led upstairs to a couples massage room. We were only on the second level, but it looked that there could be as many as FIVE levels of rooms only accessible by stair. The massage itself was relaxing and the girls were open to a few quick instructions on pressure and focus. They were able to adapt quickly and the rest of the massage left us feeling relaxed and dreamy. One negative about the massage was the location of the room. Since it faces the street, we would periodically hear car horns, yelling, etc. that would briefly bring us back to reality. Upon exiting, there was a cup of hot tea waiting for us and there was no pressure on us to finish quickly or leave. I would return to Lotus Dream Spa again during the off hours of the day to minimize the effect of the street facing massage rooms."

Having owned a very successful professional massage clinic I know what's good - finding excellent massage therapists was part of my job description, tough hey, and I always had at least two massages a week : )/My massage today I'd rate @ 9/10: good communication, clean rooms, comfortable table, the therapist checked in on how's the pressure, she picked up the sore spot and adjusted to suit, smooth, flowing, deep and the pressure was just right - I was floating. Can't wait to get back! Thank you & see you soon."

I found this one to be woeful. This wasn't really a massage- I would call it a 'soft stroke' which I barely even felt despite asking the girls three times to make it stronger ( problem was the girls don't speak any English so they didn't understand what I was saying) instead she started poking me really hard on my bones and in the stomach. It didn't appear that the girls were trained very well in massage. On top of this the prices were still high for Cambodia standards ($14US for a head neck and back massage) I read the bad reviews on tripadvisor before I came and have to say I agree with them. The owner has replied to others stating that competitors are writing these but its simply not true. Im a tourist from Australia. I don't usually write reviews but I was so disappointed with this one (probably more so because of the good reviews and expectation) that I went to the trouble of signing up and posting this. Finally, its not even about the money - don't waste a precious hour of your holiday time at this place. There are plenty of other spas in Siam Reap that are far far better and cheaper"

Picked our options off the nicely printed menus and were shown to our clean quiet massage room. The masseuse was very good. In fact so good we booked up a four hands sports massage for the following day. I've never experienced one of these but after a marathon my entire body felt 100% better for the experience.I cannot comment on prices and how they compare as despite going up recently it just seems pointless shopping around in Siam Reap when everything from the tuk tuk to the beer is so ridiculously cheap. I'm sure you can find cheaper places but seriously?"

My massage was average at best- 25% of had a good amount of pressure, 75% of it hurt/was uncomfortable. All I could feel were thumbs. The ladies who were working on us and reception were very nice which speaks to their excellent customer service, but would advise paying a little more because you get what you pay for. For me it was the slightly unpleasant experience of the massage itself."

The staff are friendly and the masseuse I saw both times was wonderful. You are welcomed into the spa with a refreshing cold cloth and cold water while the room is prepared. The first time I had a great foot scrub and an aromatherapy massage, the second time a full body scrub, 90 minute massage, pedicure with foot massage and manicure. The rooms are very clean and private and there is a private shower and toilet. The rooms are dimmed and relaxing. The products usedvall smell wonderful and left my skin feeling silky soft. The massage, whilst quite \"strong\" at times, left me feeling great, all my aches and pains miraculously disappeared! The manicure and pedicure were very thorough and left my hands and feet looking better than they have in a long while. After the treatments you can have a hot shower or just relax with some lovely hot herbal tea. The prices at Lotus Dream are great for the service given, its really great value for money. I leave Siem Reap in 2 days, but will definitely visit again before I leave!"

The owner was behind the counter and we had a friendly chat while we waited for our appointment. We were then brought into our private room with soothing music. The girls chatted a bit during the massage but it is pretty much the norm in my experience in this area. The massages were ok, not amazing or mind blowing but not terrible or painful either, average but relaxing. Everything seemed clean enough and we even had tea afterwards before we left. Overall, for the price, this place is amazing. It was very comfortable and we felt relaxed afterwards. Other spas at this price level would not offer anywhere near this quality or pampering. However, at the same time, if you're willing to spend a few extra bucks, that would put you squarely in mid-range spa territory and we had a higher quality and quiet(!) massage the next night for $12. You get what you pay for"

All the rest of the staff is Cambodian.My wife got a standard full-body massage, which she enjoyed and was very inexpensive. (I can't remember the price, but maybe like $12?) I got the traditional massage, which is even cheaper: $8/hour. You dress in cotton pajamas and lie on a bed, and a woman kneads you and at one point even stands on you.

Typically what you would spend on a single massage in Canada would enable you over a week of massages in Siem Reap.One thing we did quickly learn however is that not all massage places are created equal. Most places around pub street cost in the $5-$7 range as a starting point with a couple more dollars for oil, extra time, etc. What made Lotus Dream stand out however is the fact that it was the only place we went that had the full allotment of what we in the westernized world would expect out of a massage experience. Clean rooms, private rooms for a couples massages, staff that spoke more than a few words of english and even proper massage tables with arm rests. That is not a given at some of the places we went. One place even just had mattresses lying on the floor for their massages. Essentially in Siem Reap you get what you pay for and there is a reason that Lotus Dreams Spa is one of the more popular spots to go. You pay a couple dollars more than the average Pub Street massage but you get more than that back in value and experience."

            "review": "Professional staff and unprofessional owners. My friends and I had read a lot of positive things about this spa and was really excited about getting an foot scrub, pedicure and manicure after a long day out. We entered without any booking and was told that they had time for the three of us at that moment. We were told by the owner that we should expect that the treatments would last for 2 hours instead of 1.5. We sat down and it was clear that they didn't have lamps for 3 customers at once so the girl who did my treatment worked in darkness. She was very sweet but half way through my treatments something happened. Another customer came in and had the same treatment as the three of us, so our treatments was slowed down and in addition to that the owner had forgotten about another reservation. Because of this another woman (the wife of the owner i guess) took over and did my manicure. This would have been perfect if she had been competent enough but she had a baby in the back of the spa who started crying and instead of saying \"would you excuse me a minute\" she hurried through my manicure and ran away. I ended up having ugly uneven nails with nailpolish all over my fingers (took less than 5 minutes). At that point the 2 hours had already passed and I still hadn't got my pedicure. The staff who were treating my friends were very sorry about the behavior and kept excusing the other woman on her behalf but I was still left waiting since there was no one to continue my treatment.It took a total of 3.5 hours before my friends and I could leave the spa and at least 1 hour was spent on waiting for my treatments.In the end I tried to hint how unhappy I was with the treatments but the owner just laughed and said ok.It might be cheap but make sure to take at least 3 hours off if you want a treatment in there."

            "review": "Not worth the price difference. After reading the good reviews received, we decided to book a traditional massage for my wife and a four hand deep tissue sport massage for myself. We feared that we could not have a massage when we wanted it (due to the high recommendations on tripadvisor). Two days before, we make an appointment, there were no booking for the day we wanted and only one for the next day. When we came back two days later no one was present in the shop. A European with a baby came in and, after staring at us during 10 seconds, he finally said \"What can I do for you?\" (This was the owner I presume) I told him we had a reservation. Without saying nothing, he went to the desk, he opened the appointment book and after went away without a word. Two minutes later he came back with two glasses of fresh water. He told us \"It will be 10 minutes later. Is this ok for you?\" He gives no reason and no apologies for the delay. After 15 minutes they took us in a room together (it was a bit strange because a previous review mentioned that those massages are done in two different places).The therapists came in and without asking anything about physical problems they begin the treatment (my wife has pain on her neck, it has to be treated carefully)The treatment was average. For the 4 hands treatment one girl was treating the legs while the other one took care of my arms and my shoulders. They didn't take care of my back. The therapist who was taking care of my legs seems competent, I had the feeling the other one was a beginner.My wife did not find the traditional massage better than the ones she had in Siemens Reap.To summarize, the welcome was cold and not very professional (the appointment was not respected) and the treatment was not better (but not worse) than other places in Siemens Reap. But the price is higher.I had expected more based on the other reviews."

I chose the 90 min 4 hands relaxation massage, and my partner chose the 4 hands sports massage, but after being told that those massages could only be done in different rooms we ended up both having the relaxation massages so we could be in the same room, throughout. Unlike some of the other massage places I've been to in SE Asia the therapists only spoke to each other in whispers and the lights were dimmed, to create an ideal, relaxing environment. Before the massages we were left in a room to change into tiny disposable knickers! This was both entertaining and handy, because there was no issue with oil getting on our clothes. The back component of the massage was the best I've ever had (and my partner is a massage therapist!), and the amount of pressure was just right. We had these massages quite early in our trip and later discovered that what we thought was very cheap was actually more expensive than some other options, but the quality and professionalism we experienced was unparalleled, and the cost was definitely fair. Great experience!"

Usually when I see 5 star ratings it is a \"sure bet\". The plus side is that the booking was fast response and easy- thank you. However, there are some definite issues I think the owners should know about so that others don't end up walking away with a negative feeling: 1. The ladies working showed up to work minutes after the massage was set to start which led the massage to begin 10 minutes late, 2. There was no consultation prior to the massage about problem areas or preferences, 3. The one-hour massage was only 40 minutes (I was told to sleep for the rest of the time as the lady left me alone in the room) which I simply can't understand, 4. The facial was nice however again I was left for long periods of time alone in the room during the facial (12 minutes and again for 10) and the materials from the facial seeped into my eyes during this time and stung terribly. I estimated that of the 90 total minutes of service I was actually alone in the room for a full 30 minutes. They were friendly, yes. The prices are good, yes. But my overall experience was poor. I hope it works out better for others following this review."

Real rooms with nice music. The girls were talking to each other, but only wispering, so it didn't really bothered us. At some point, talking in the lobby became quite loud, so maybe that's a point that could be improved. The second day, my massagiste was less experienced and didn't know how to deal with pregnancy, so she skiped the back, even thoug I explained to her how to do it, witch was a pity. But she was showing interest and trying to do a good job, so it wasn't bad finally. Another good point is that you can control the air conditioning, so I wasn't freezing like in other places.On the second floor the room and the towels were a bit tired off, so maybe it's a good time to refresh them...All in all, it was worthy and I recommend this place"

It was so relaxing she fell asleep several times during the massage. Her only criticism was that near the end of the massage her masseuse told her about her hard life, that she had separated from her husband that used to beat her and that she had kids to look after. A clear attempt at a bit of emotional blackmail to elicit a decent tip. I also notice the same masseuse was hanging around the reception area watching us as we paid and left.I did leave a fair tip for all the masseurs but I have to say that whilst my heart does go out to the aforementioned lady and her hard life I don't appreciate the way she tried to get a bigger tip. I think this is unprofessional and unfair. It means that the customer leaves feeling sad for the masseuse instead of leaving calm / stress free as they should.I had the traditional Khmer 4 hands deep tissue massage. It was very good and the hands were most adept at finding areas of tension and working the tension out. As others have said it can be a little strange as they are working on different areas at the same time. Broadly speaking one pair of hands works on the upper body whilst the other pair works on lower body. They were well choreographed and managed to do their jobs together without getting in each others way, not a simple feat.I have to say I would recommend it, I am glad I did it and would go back."

            "review": "Bikini wax was a new low point. Traveling around SE Asia, I've looked for waxes in tourist centers, and had really high hopes about this place after reading a couple reviews for bikini waxes and their great massages. It sounded clean, professional, and friendly, but I should have looked for a place known mostly for waxing, not as a side service (if that exists in Siem Reap). It was also just for my routine monthly maintenance, which means it tends to be quick and easy. They got me in about 20 minutes after I walked in without an appointment, people left raving about massages, I told the guy at the front desk I'd be getting a full bikini wax, everything was fine. Then I went upstairs, where a friendly woman sat on my legs and feet and got to work. She didn't really let me move the rest of the time, meaning her access was pretty limited, something that contributed to her inability to rip off my hair.First I thought the wax wasn't hot enough because it hurt so badly when she smeared it on but when I peeked (she'd put a towel over my face) she was actually using a glue stick kind of applicator with cold wax. Didn't strike me as particularly sanitary but beggars can't be choosers. She also used strips that you rub together in your hands to heat up, which have never worked in my experience and I've never seen in a spa before. So, very painful application using ineffective drugstore supplies meant that she went over the same areas literally more than a dozen times. When I felt skin ripping off, I stopped her and cleaned up. It was the first time I left a wax half done (my husband said he'd shave off half his mustache to match). When I walked out, the guy asked whether I'd gotten the full bikini to which I responded that I was supposed to but that I didn't let her finish. That it didn't work out really. He raised his eyebrows, said he'd charge me for the half and that was it. No more concern about the service which is weird because manager responses to bad reviews here tend to be so accusatorial that customers didn't say anything before posting to the internet. So, in conclusion, I wouldn't go back for a wax, I would actually still try them for a massage based on other reviews and the look of the spa, and I hope that I don't get personally attacked for sharing my experience. I realize that I can't expect the same supplies and services and staff training as I get in the US and Europe, but this was shocking and so so painful. Some tips: I'm guessing that proper soft wax is vintage enough now that it's available and maybe even hard wax, no more glue sticks and hand-warmed strips. Also training on how to position the client (skin should be taut) so as to make it easier on everyone to get the job done well and quickly. Now if you'll excuse me I've gotta go smear ointment on my hooha."

Apparently they reserve their splendor for the massage therapists. The woman I had was amazing! I got an hour head, shoulder and back (with oil $10) and a half hour foot massage. This woman not only worked out my travel kinks, but she found kinks that had been hibernating for the past decade and zapped those with her magic hands! Seriously, get yourself there now.

They also offer manicures/pedicures. The prices are very reasonable. My Swedish aromatherapy massage was $15/1hr. Nice touch--you get cold water and a cold towel (very refreshing on a rather warm day) upon ordering. And once you are finished, your shoes and hot green tea are waiting for you in the lobby. The massage itself was absolutely wonderful and extremely relaxing. My one hour flew by. My masseuse was obviously well trained and worked a little extra on exactly the spots that hurt. I went in with a headache and rather sore back from biking all day, and came out pain free and relaxed. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a great massage at an awesome price. Thumbs up to the owner and his wife for maintaining an excellent and professional massage and spa!"

The massages are quite intense, and very different from the deep tissue massages we are used to having back home. We were all very pleased with the experience. We enjoyed chatting with the British owner, and like other reviewers found the premises to be very clean. There are tons of massage places right out on the streets in Siem Reap, with very cheap prices, but it is definitely worth the $8 for the hour massage or $15 for the 4 hand massage to get the quality and professional services of the Lotus Dream Spa. This is a fraction of the cost of massages in North America and we would have for sure returned for a second massage had we had a longer time in Siem Reap."

I now have almost full rotation of my left shoulder and absolutely no need for surgery.I make sure I ring and book now as I like 1 hour Khmer massage and 1 hour oil massage and the price is more than reasonable. In fact I think too good to be true.My partner also goes at least once a weekend for 2 hours and the girls have almost fixed his lower back pain.He even has a facial now as a special treat.

She asked often (but not too much) if the pressure was ok."

Ive got serious back problems and a lot of treatments do not work for me. I got a four hand deep tissue massage,which also included some streaching, by two very professional and friendly ladies. They really take such great care of you in there and you feel incredibble afterwards. Rick was also really helpful and knows a lot about alternative medicine. I am truely happy and feel very blessed to have found this wonderful place. Price value is more than perfect as well. What else can u wish for. Go treat yourself!"

They have an official door greeter, she is one of the therapist's daughter... so adorable.. The place is run like a real spa, the prices are amazing and the therapists were great. $15 for the four hand Khmer massage for ONE HOUR..We were there for over 2.5 hours, combined we had 2, Khmer four hand massages, 1 four hand massage with oil and a mani and pedi..and the bill was $71 total...we did the calculations if you were in the states it would have been over $500!!!!

I got the four hands oil massage for 1 1/2 hours and it was epic! The women were very skilled and sensitive to my needs, constantly asking if I was hurting or if I needed an adjustment. I like a pretty strong massage, and they were able to really give me a deep tissue massage on the areas that was sore without going overboard and hurting me. At the same time, they were able to give me a lighter massage on other areas that are more sensitive such as my thighs. The facilities are superb and I really felt like I was in a luxurious spa. Overall, an excellent value at about $30! I will be coming back every night that I am here in Siem Reap."

We were offered cold glass of water + scented flannel on arrival + green tea after. We changed into really cool cotton pajamas for the massage - which was I'm told something like a thai massage - with lots of stretching - and pummeling with hands + feet! The room was cool and clean with relaxing music. In all really good value for money - 8 dollars for an hour - I guess some of the other places in town are a little cheaper - but probably not as nice."

Everything from this spa was consistently great, the staff was professional and friendly. The owners are always at the front desk, and since one of them is British he is able to available to answer questions in English. Don't waste your time and money on other, more expensive spas.

While perhaps not as nicely appointed as Sokkhak Spa, our group of four all agreed that the massages at the Lotus Dream Spa were wonderful and everyone left feeling relaxed, satisfied and without any sense of disappointment. To boot, the price of our massages (we went for the aromatherapy massages) was about half of what we would have paid at some of the more upscale massage shops so it was an excellent bargain indeed. The staff were all kind and attentive and seemed well trained. For those who value a quality massage more than glamorous surroundings, a visit to Lotus Dream Spa will not certainly not disappoint.

There were 3 of us and we wanted a number of treatments. The owner was great and gave us a really good deal so we could all have a body scrub, massage, manicure and pedicure each.The scrub and the massage were amazing! The therapists were very attentive and made sure we were well looked after.Although the facilities aren't five star, the spa is clean and affordable. Many of the spa's around Siem Reap are at the opposite ends of the scale - either too expensive or a bit didgy looking. It was nice to find an in-between spa that catered to our needs.Although our body scrub and massages were great, one of my friends was not too happy with her manicure, hence the very good rating, as opposed to the excellent. However, do not let this put you off as the massage is probably one of the best i have ever had!

I tried foot scrub and spa as well and they are fantastic too. Must try in Siem Reap."

The staff are courteous and trained, the facilities are quite and clean, and the prices are welcoming. You can find places which cost less, but they will merely \"rub\" you, not properly massage. You can find other places that will properly massage, but the cost is at least twice what you will find here. I highly recommend you take a step or two off the main path to visit this spa."

It has pleasant and warm welcome, it is clean, respectable and the masseurs are well trained. From start to finish the treatment is top class. This time round I decided to treat myself and go for the 4 hand deep tissue massage. It was awesome. It was really invigorating. Afterward I felt alive and energised. They did a really good job. I find the comments of the previous customer hard to believe, the masseurs were attentive, they asked my preferences a few times and I only heard a little amount of whispering. There is nothing better than the four hand massage I will come back on my next trip in July."

Easy to find and within walking distance from pub street. I fell in love with the place . Clean, calm and peaceful setting. The people there were most courteous and make me welcome. I had a shower there and tried the traditional massage. It was so soothing. I had a two hr massage and by the 2nd hour I was in in dream land, fast asleep. the second night I tried aromatherapy again for two hrs and it was a dream sent from heaven. The massager was very professional and knows where to massage away my tired body after I spent one whole day walking in Angkor watt. If you want a good and satisfying massage , look no further. This is the place. Highly recommended."

The administrative part was great. Easy to find and schedule and good price. I reserved a 4 hands massage and told them I liked a really strong massage. Unfortunately, even though I asked for stronger a few times, it never got string enough to work out my kinks. The room was clean and comfortable temperature and there is a handheld shower for afterwards.The two ladies who did my massage were nice and caring. Their movements were pretty synchronized, too much so. This was definitely an \"autopilot\" massage. That would have been ok and it would have been a relaxing and nice massge, although not therapeutic, had it not been for their constant talking! They talked (softly) to each other the entire timing, sometimes stifled laughing. It was extremely distracting. I couldn't relax. So if you go here, don't get the 4 hands massage unless you want constant chatter."

Instead of going to one of the cheap backpacker places or the super posh over-priced spas, my boyfriend and I decided to visit Lotus Dream. My oh my...So unfortunately at the time, certain areas of Siem Reap had lost power - for over 4 days and counting! Businesses were getting huge setbacks due to the long outage. We went to the spa crossing our fingers that they had electricity. Lo and behold, they too were out of power - however that did not stop them.We were immediately greeted with friendly smiles as the owner spoke to us, apologizing for the outage which wasn't even his fault. He said if we really wanted a massage they could work something out, even saying that it would be romantic with lit candles. I thought that was super cute. It was also sweltering outside and we have been walking around trying to find the place so we felt gross, so the owner suggested that he could provide us with a big bucket of cold water so we could rinse off before and after the massage. Usually there are showers guests can use but without power, they were useless haha.The owner was so accommodating that we could not resist but get a massage. We decided on a 1.5hr massage - the owner said he would even give us a discount because of the power outage. Of course we declined and paid full price because the business shouldn't get paid less for something that is beyond their control.Our massage was wonderful. We started off by a cool refreshing rinse and changed into massage clothes provided by the spa. Each of our masseuses were attentive and gave us both the best massage we have ever had in Asia. Because it was hot they supplied us with cool towels to place on our foreheads which they repeatedly replaced to keep cool. My masseuse even used ice cubes to cool off my skin as she was giving me a massage~! My boyfriend had that option as well but he said it was too cold - regardless the ladies were soooo thoughtful and attentive. They thought of creative ways to make the massage work despite the power outage and the heat. Not to mention they themselves must have had a workout as it was hot and they were doing all the work!!!If and when we should ever go back to Siem Reap - we would surely without even any hesitation - go straight back to this place.It was clean, service was great, prices extremely reasonable - I really cannot recommend this place enough. Enjoy~!"

We found this spa to be very clean and the girls good. Prices are also very reasonable. You can have a hot water shower after an oil massage. The toilet however was not that great but OK \u2013 it was rather small and the water pressure poor. One small irritant was that the two girls who attended to me and my sister ( in the same room) kept chatting with each other. Yet we were happy enough and revisited the place by prior appointment two days later. Although we were told they open at noon when we went they were still getting the place in order and there was no one to serve us. We were there for 45 minutes before we could get on with our appointments. My husband came later that evening and he too had a similar experience. On the whole I felt they were not professional enough and perhaps poorly staffed. But then for the price it was still very good.I must also add that the Australian lady running the establishment told us that she finances a community project she does with little kids from the money she makes on this. So you can also have the satisfaction that your money goes towards a good cause."

Feel like a mix of Balinese massage & Thai massage without the overwhelming stretching, very good pressure, right accupoint, perfect. There are plenty of spa around the city, but Lotus Dream Spa felt so good at the 1st try that i don't want to take chances to try out other spas. Me & my husband went there 3 days in a row, i love the oil massage the most, mainly because i've got one of the best masseur of the house I guess. because comparing to the other masseur i've got for traditional massage, it was slightly less strength, but still good. Love it so much. And it's cheap too! I would go back to siem reap because of the massage than the temple."

As the style of massages of us are very different, we were taken to different rooms. The room was clean and the atmosphere was relaxing. Most importantly, the staff gave very good massage! I can say it was one of the best and enjoyable massages I've ever had!!! I am so regretted that we did not find it earlier so that we could go there more times during our stay in SS.The only thing lacked is the location, maybe I should say lacking direction signs near the shop under the dark environment. We walked along the Sivatha Bd. but we missed the little street leading to the shop. And we finally brought to the spa shop with assistance from the hotel staff. (We stayed in Terrasse des Elephants which is about 1 to 2 mins walk to the shop). It may be just us who were too tired from daytime travel and having orientation problem who could not find the place easily. But don't hesitate to go there and enjoy this nice spa~!!"

The staff were friendly yet professional, the welcome was warm and the cold towel before and pot of tea afterwards were nice extras.

I got a chance to speak to the owner while I was waiting and she explained how Lotus provides funding for the charity she sponsors, assisting students with English and much more. The owner herself was lovely, friendly and welcoming, I could have chatted to her all day. I got a foot scrub and pedicure, all was done with precision and care. I also got an eyebrow wax and lip wax, I couldn't believe how much time and effort she took to complete both. After my waxing and pedicure they even treated me to a neck and shoulder massage for a few minutes. Plus a cool towel and water on arrival and a nice hot tea for afterwards. Its only a minute walk past the old market, check out their website for a map which shows exactly where they are. I will definitely be going back!"

Lotus Dream SPA is run by a mother and son who are in Siem Reap to help the community; they opened a school and offer lessons free of change to the students. Besides their inspirational actions, the spa itself is beautiful! Well kept, clean, friendly staff and perfectionists!

Although more expensive than many other parlors around, the price is justified by the clean, professionnal and welcoming environnement. My husband and I both got an 1 hour full body oil massage and were very satisfied. The manager being an (very nice) english speaker, it does make things easier to give specific indications and be sure to be understood. If you want to be sure of the quality of the massage you get and to enjoy a clean and pleasant environment and are willing to pay a bit more than the average price of the town, this is definitely a good choice!"

There is a wide range of massage parlors in Seam Riep center.Varying from the very cheap-ly on the floor-use the same blanket as the guy before-where the girls have NO idea what a massge really is, upto high standard resorts in expensive hotels.What you see is what you get. What you pay is what you get.Someweher in the middle is Lotus Dream, just a short walk from the old market and Pub street.Reception is great: run by a foreign couple (or mom and son?) and you will get a cold towel and a water.You make your pick from the treatments. We just wanted a nice full hour massage. That starts at $ 8 and goes up to $28 if you like 4-hands.We picked a Swedish.Now comes the critical bit...as a longterm traveller all around Asia I must have done about..ehum..200 massages in all varieties.The building looks good: it must have been a hotel before.There is a bathroom with toilet but the tissue was finished, the soap was squeezed by many before me, the shamppo and bodywas were scattered and nearly empty.If only they take care of these details..! That could do the trick!The massage: nice friendly girls in wonderful costumes doing their very best but it is obvious they never got a real trainig.Massage should also touch the muscles, not just the skin.If only they would teach the girls some basic knowledge. Not themselves, because they just probably invested in this business new to them.After all: you come here not for the ambiance, not for the nice tea afterwards, not for the friendly owners, but for a good massage.And this just simply was average. Not more."

After searching around town by bicycle and going to a 2 cheap places for massages that were so-so, we decided to use Trip Advisor. I was skeptical about this place because the website was not that great looking and because of the few bad reviews on here. But we passed by the spa one day on our bikes and decided to give it try because it looked so cute and the receptionist was so nice!I gotta say, I am SO GLAD that we decided to give this place a shot, because it was THE BEST place that we went to while in Siem Reap. The temples were amazing of course, but this spa was #2 on my list. We are two students and so the prices here were just right. Not only that, but the place was extremely clean and the receptionist and attendants were all very kind and gentle in manner, doing their work with utmost care and diligence. The rooms were NOT old and NOT dirty, and NOT full of bugs! The place is off a dusty street, but for crying out loud, this is CAMBODIA people. All the streets are dusty! The women did talk among themselves seldomly, but it was very softly, and to me it just added to my experience there since their voices were like music to my ears.In light of the treatment that I received at this spa, the bad reviews given to this place had me pissed. I am convinced that the bad reviews were written by some spoiled little brat who is used to 5 star hotels spas, or by someone who is used to getting his/her way all the time (and didn't, so they wrote a spiteful review). If you are looking for that kind of treatment, then Jesus go to a 5 star hotel! If you want great service, clean rooms (and they have clean linens and towels of course!!) that is very pleasantly decorated, with soothing music, and hot showers (with plenty of water lol), and VERY reasonably priced (and all the profits from this place go to a local English school for Cambodian children), then I highly recommend this place!By the way I got the Lotus Dream Specialty Package: Body scrub, facial (and simple massage too!). 1.5 hours long, and I felt SO CLEAN afterwards. Beware the scrub is pretty abrasive (if you have sensitive skin it might not be for you), but it cleans and polishes your skin like gold. Its like I shed my old skin and emerged anew. I felt like I was glowing and still do 2 days later. If I'm ever in Cambodia again, I'll skip everywhere else and just come here :))The only thing this place can improve on is perhaps getting a better looking website. My friend also got a wax... she suggested perhaps they offer some wine to their customers to help ease the edge? Hehe :)"

At other Thai/Cambodian massage places, the pressure is not very firm. (I'm a deep tissue kind of girl.) Here, the pressure was great and the masseuses were great at checking to make sure the pressure was ok. My friend and I also had a pedicure for $8. Absolutely no complaints here either. The girl who did my nails took her time, was very thorough, and made sure the glitter nail polish I picked out made it onto every toenail. I usually don't get pedicures in the United States because I generally don't find them enjoyable (got suckered into this one by my friend), but I would actually consider getting them more often if there were a place like this back at home.

Lotus spa, on the other hand, makes sure that their clothes and towels are changed every single time. was there for my neck back and shoulder massage and i felt so energised afterwards. well done. lots spa."

The place is very professional with a nice setting, and the money raised by the spa goes towards a good charity. The massage itself was nice, though my feet kept being rubbed against the bed which made a high pitched sqeaky sound, which made it hard to relax. Also the 2 massagers my fiance had used different pressure so that one side of him was being massaged quite hard, while he could barely feel the other side.All in all, it is a very nice spa, with a nice relaxed atmosphere. However, a few improvements would make the place perfect."

There are masses of places offering massages from $1 upwards so decided to look on trip advisor for some guidance. We were really glad we did. The Lotus Dream spa was very clean and comfortable. We were greeted by friendly staff who gave us a ice cold flannel and water while they prepared the room. We had a couples room with air conditioning and 2 beds. There was lovely relaxing music in the background. We were asked to change into thin cotton tops and baggy trousers. Our feet were washed prior to the massage, which was a nice touch. The girls then came in and gave the most amazing (firm deep tissue) massages. They were very professional.After our massage lasted 1 blissful hour. We were then given tea after we changed back into our clothes.We were informed that profits from the spa support a local school teaching English to Cambodian children, which gives an additional feel good factor.As previous reviews it is not right in the heart of the town but is fairly easy to find. After finding the elephant hotel on the left keep going until you get to the roundabout, bear right and you will see the spa on the right on the road that leads to the artisans workshops.We highly recommend this spa and for only $8 it is excellent value for money."

            "review": "Good value, good purpose. My friend and I wanted to try a local spa but wanted to avoid very low-end ones with people harassing you once you passed by in the Old Market area. After reading up on Tripadvisor, I personally tried both Lemongrass (which is cheaper but not as good in terms of skill of masseuse and neatness of the place) and Lotus Dream. Lotus Dream is near a roundabout about 300m from the end of the Old Market so it's a little off the beaten track but the small distance is not a very big deal.First, you're greeted with a cold towel, and a quite-tasteless welcome drink. However, please be assured that the local Cambodian girls are very gentle and eager to please once you show up at the door. I selected a 2-hour oil 4-hand deep tissue massage for this visit. They didn't do a footbath but when you lie on the bed, they will clean your feet with a hot towel. The bed is basic with a hole to look into when you lie down, covered with a sarong cloth instead of white fluffy bath towels.The strokes are firm enough (although I'd have preferred it harder) but the girls are relatively quiet (they whisper if they have to) and didn't disturb me throughout my treatment. I would say this place is good for a basic relaxing massage to ease away your aches and pains, but don't expect a treatment which purports to give you magical healing properties or brings to you an \"awakening state of Nirvana\" of sorts. At USD 27 nett for a 2-hour 4-hand massage (done by 2 therapists at a time) of decent standard, this is one of the best possible value you can have around the Southeast Asia region. I've tried many spas, ranging from good local chains to five-star hotel ones throughout Southeast Asia. A minus point is that I happened to be there during Water Festival so there was blaring music with a staged performance nearby, and at 4 plus to 6 plus, there's a lot of traffic at the roundabout where this spa is located. So, if you can, please ask for a room at the back. My friend had her treatment in a room at the back and had no such problems. Another small minus point is that they do not provide disposable underwear (yet) but I suppose at almost half the price of equivalent local spas in Thailand, I might not really complain. Lotus Dream has just been taken over by an Australian lady, Lyn Harvey in the last week of Oct 2011, who uses the profits of the spa to fund the Cambodian English Language School which teaches English to Cambodian children by a team of 4 volunteers. This is her source of funding the school, so whilst you're enjoying your treatment, you can do your bit for the local community as well. Lyn is friendly and open to your feedback so do give her comments on how to improve the spa to keep this place going so she can fund the school."

My partner and I cycled the beaten up bike we rented for a dollar all the way from our guesthouse in search of this \"dream spa\" and oh we were not disappointed at all! The moment we walked in, we were shown the menu and given a glass of cold water and a cold towel. It instantly refreshed us and we just couldn't decide what to go for from the extensive range of massages and treatments. I then decided on an hour of the traditional massage, a half hour foot massage and mani/pedi. Sounds like a lot but it only costed me 24USD in total! My partner took 2 hours of traditional massage and a half hour foot massage.We were then shown to our private room and asked to change into a comfortable set of shirt and pants. I enjoy Thai massage so this massage was just perfect for me as it also involves stretching and kneading on some comfortable points on your body.The masseuses were wonderful and are pure experts on what they do. I felt so pampered and comfortable that I actually fell asleep halfway through. After the massage, I was shown back downstairs to get my hands and feet lovingly manicured. They did a wonderful job and we both stepped out feeling so well taken care of and ready for another busy day in Siem Reap.Great job, Lotus Dream Spa! I would recommend anyone to go there to enjoy the wonderful services you guys offer!"

We walked in off the street and were immediately accommodated for the 2 hour aromotherapy massage. Both of us were really impressed with the skills of the masseuses who hit the right pressure points, worked on problem back areas, used the side of arms at times, and hopped up on the table to apply extra pressure. The place is clean with a/c rooms. My room was on the second level and my husband was on the third level. The massage was as good if not better than any at the 5 star hotels. It was so good, my husband went back today for a repeat massage before flying back to Phnom Penh!

Our guest house owner recommended the Lotus Dream Spa, run by foreigners and known to be a respectable clean place. we were lucky that the place was still open (although half meter of water in front) and a very welcoming staff was thrilled to see us open the door. They had nobody for 2 days and were so happy to please us that we spent 2 hours being pampered with a 4 hands oil massage and a body scrub for my wife. I never had such experience before, the most sensual feeling in a wonderful setting. Super clean, cool music, AC working and even a cup of tea after my treatment. Also excellent prices for the qualityI wish them good luck and hope all this water will soon disappear so they can keep perform their excellent duties."

Upon consulting with the manager there, we decided on 1.5 hours of traditional massage (USD11 each) and 1 hour body scrub (USD22 each). We started with massage which was bad- the masseurs did not get any of the pressure points and my husband has nails mark all over his body due to long fingernails! And then it was body scrub time. We were told to change and the masseurs had the scrub lotion in a coconut bowls-one for each of us. What they did was simply apply the scrub on our body- in random directions and half way through, my masseurs actually spill all the scrub in the bowl and we ended up sharing one bowl between the two of us! After applying, towel over our body and they simply left. We were left in the room with scrub on us for 40 minutes after which they return with wet towels to wipe off the scrub. By then the scrub has hardened and it was very waxy! Since the scrub has dried up, it was really painful to wipe off. Both of us ended up taking long hot shower just to wash off the scrub. Our skin did not feel soft and smooth but it was just waxy. We paid USD22 each for the body scrub which was a nightmare!!!! I would not recommend this place to anyone!"

Very relaxing but uneventful; afterwards you feel o.k. but nothing special.Looking back I think they just teach these girls the basics, but don't really invest in good training.

I am not an expert on massage techniques, so I can't say whether they were accurate or not. I felt good afterwards. It is inexpensive, but I'd have been willing to pay more at another place to get a proper bed.

I started with the Absolute Stress Relaxing Massage which had the masseuse giving me what was supposed to be a traditional massage which was a little too gentle for my liking. So when asked to go stronger, she would oblige then revert back to the soft squeezing of the flesh after a few minutes. I went back again for the 4 hands Deep Tissue Sport Massage and it was exactly like my first massage except with 2 masseuses and the flesh squeezing was a lot stronger but it was not a deep tissue sport massage. Furthermore, one of the masseuse was rough, had body odor, and a different pattern of massage from the other so it was disconcerting as it seemed that they were differently trained and not in sync.As I was familiar with what a Deep Tissue Sport Massage is, the one offered by Lotus was nothing like it. When the owner arrived, I asked him what the difference between the two massages were and he mentioned that it's all the same just that there were 2 people doing the same massage. He had put down different names for similar massages. So be warned, you might not be getting what you expect and if you're a stickler for good massage technique, this is not the place to go."

I have been to Siem Reap many times and have had many massages, but Lotus Dream Spa has to represent the best value. It is extremely clean, nicely decorated with individual rooms; the massages are excellent and the staff also extremely friendly. It has the quality of the more expensive SPA's in Siem Reap but with prices nearer the lower end, however the massage shops at the lower end usually have many mattresses in one room and sometimes re-use towels for different clients and the staff are either taking to each other or on their mobile phones during the massage, which is something that does not happen here and consequently you have a more relaxing experience.It is a truly relaxing experience and a great way to finish off a day after visiting the temples and I thoroughly recommend a visit. I know I will be back there on my next visit to Siem Reap!"

Truly a beautiful dream in the heart of old Siem Reap.Anyone who has traveled extensively in South-East Asia knows two things: few things are better than traditional massage, and finding the right one amidst the overwhelming horde can be next to impossible.Lotus Dream Spa manages to bring the cleanliness and attention to detail one finds at the highest-end spas in the area down to a much more affordable level. I went ahead and got a full two-hour treatment (an incredible luxury that still cost less than a decent meal in the States!), and by the end I felt as though all the worries in the world had melted away.The staff is wonderfully friendly and kind, and very attentive. They managed to take away the stress that had built up in my back from traveling, and I left feeling completely rejuvenated. The atmosphere is very relaxing as well, with soothing music playing throughout, and a beautiful decor.I'm not sure when I'll next be in Siem Reap, but I guarantee you when I do visit again, the Lotus will be my first stop! Highly recommended."

My tuk-tuk driver was a little challenged finding the Mantra Guest House where the massage place is located in room 102. I was given a clean t-shirt and shorts to change into. The masseuse does shiatsu which is very different from the deep tissue sports massages I generally get. But she did focus on my bad shoulder and although her deep work was sometimes painful, my shoulder is working much better and hurting less than usual. I'm heading towards a shoulder replacement but if I could find a masseuse like this I think I could put off the surgery for another year. The Japanese masseuse was much better than the physical therapists I've been working with. $40 for a 90 minute massage. Expensive for Siem Reap but well worth it."

It is not a luxurious setting and there is no place to sit and wait other than an outdoor area which gets wet when it rains. They are very busy so you need to book in advance.

Their websites etc. are quite hard to understand - much of it is in Japanese and the formatting is weird! But the response by email was quick and informative and we booked for the two of us to go simultaneously $30 each for a 60 minute session. They give you clothes to change into and the massage is full body, dry and gentle. They have an amazing knowledge of anatomy, and although it is gentle, manage to poke and press every single spot you need massaged over the course of the hour.I found the massage to be deeply relaxing as well, and we both felt the hour felt like 15-20 minutes. A good sign! Also the hot towels on the feet was extremely nice. We walked out of there wishing we could have a massage like that every day to start the day off - it would be life changing. Anyway afterwards my husband felt his shoulder felt the best it had felt in months - after one gentle session! These guys really know their stuff and if they can convince us that gentle is good - they must have some magic powers :) Highly recommended!"

From the pub street, it is about 15mins ride. I had an hour of shiatsu done by Ms. Naoko who is so pro. She didn't rush and performed an excellent shiatsu from head to toe. She even diagnosed me after the session which was good. The session completed with a cup of hot tea to relax even more. This place is quite popular among the Japanese communities in Siem Reap.

They r just doing for money.But this guys learned massage in Japan and knows about which point is releasing tense so it might be really hurts if you have tense in your body but afterwords you will feel lighter with ur shoulder or body. I'm working with PC all day so my shoulder is so heard but after I had Shiatsu I felt lighter and my vision was clear so I recommend his Shiatsu maassage.Compare with local, you might feel its bit expensive but still way Cheever than I have back in japan."

Prices are in US$, TO CHECK if any massage parlour are good, i usually do a foot massage, ($6 for 1hr), it was really good, u can choose to sit inside or out in those rattan chairs & i believe every single masseur is experienced. next day after Angkor trip decided to go full body oil massage with hot stones. Remember, if you let them know you are coming again, they give you a card with 20% discount on it, so get it. for this whole body massage i ended up paying $16 US only after dis. you need to go upstairs for massage, dingy rooms but clean washrooms to change if you want than the room itself. if you are a traveller expecting five star class for get it, this is not the place. for the price you pay, i highly recommend this place for massage. it was extremely satisfying & very refreshing. the masseur was really very good. tip : inform masseur to use hot towel to wipe your body after oil massage, this way you need to take again another shower but rather in your own hotel once your are back.worth the money you are paying, thats my opinion. timing - not sure on morning but they are open way after midnight daily.location - middle of pub st, easy to identify"

My hubby had the Thai massage, and I had the Khmer massage with oil. Well, they took us upstairs into this large communal room, which was quite weird. It had about 10+ floor beds, and there were a couple of other people getting massages. We had to change behind this little curtain ... I can't say the towel that they gave me to wrap myself in was the cleanest, and it was awkward having to position myself on the bed with other people in the room. On the bright side, the lady who did my massage was actually quite good and very thorough. However, you can hear a lot of street noise, the music that the spa plays is a little odd, and the mass massages were a little uncomfortable (noise and interruptions). As our massages we're finishing, a group of about 5 people came upstairs and awkward as heck trying not to flash them while trying to get up to get dressed. Despite the fact that I liked my massage, the lack of privacy was off-putting and I don't plan on returning."

I avoid the high-end massage place and I try to use the massage places in the middle range price band. The real difference between the places depends on the masseuse, if you find a good one ask for her/him. In the high-end spa you can find a really nice ambience, but at the end it is important the person that does the massage. Pura Vida has many branches in Siem Reap. Sometimes during my visits I went to Pura Vida in Sivatha Blvd, but the last time I went to the branch in Pub Street. I tried there a few masseuses, but Cindy (she speaks great English) and Chrerb do a great job. Pura Vida is a nice place and I think with Cindy or Chrerb is a good value for your money. Another place that I use often, because the lady does a great job is Island Massage around the corner on Thnou Street. The place is not so nice as Pura Vida, but it is cheaper and the masseuse Bo can do it really well and strong, if you like it."

The people were friendly, professional, and very accommodating . The was a great place to relax and get a 1st rate spa treatment . Fyi , Cambodia currency of choice is U.S dollars so it's better to have U.S dollars instead of Cambodian Riel."

I didn't get a drink the whole time, there was no music and worst of all: they used an old nail colour. I didn't get a base coat, the coulour took ages to dry and was applied badly, as there are many bubbles in it. Since the colour was too old, it never dried properly so half a day later it already was damaged. I could have done this way better on my own."

The foot scrub started off well with the first foot, then my lady rushed my second foot and scrubbed for only 5 minutes then left. It later turns out she was asked to do a facial massage for another client, if this was the case, pure vida should have allocated me a masseuse that could stay with me for an hr, not 20 minutes! I then had a second lady who did not finish my foot scrub, she only proceeded to give me a massage that mostly massaged my calves. After a long day walking around the temples, I was hoping for more of a food massage than leg. She probably spent 25 minutes only my legs and 5 on my feet, despite me asking her to concentrate of my feet.Would not recommend- disappointing all round"

My massage was pretty good although my masseuse cracked my spine without first asking me if I had back problems (which I do) and for a few days I suffered from sciatica. The nail person I had was really nice and chatty and I found out from her that for my $5.00 nail treatment she got the equivalent of 75cents and for going a massage she got $1. I was kind of shocked as there are at least five of these places owned by the same person in Siem Reap. Another day we went to the Pura Vida by the Ankor Mart to get a pedicure. There were no customers in there but the three workers were most disinterested. One person gave us nail polishes to look at and then left to go outside and socialise with another worker outside and the other staff member - who was about two metres away from us just kept looking on her computer and paying us no attention. We walked out! We will not be back ."

I had to ask for nail polish re,over not to leave the place with nail polish on my hands, yes, I said on my hands! It is only 5$ but still way too much for what I got.

The massage is more physio/chiro (pressing, not rubbing) which really helps to relieve any sore spots. The staff are friendly & competent. Classical music playing is also a bonus."

So we stopped by here (store near night market) for 30 minutes foot massage. Even though the payment was so small ($3 per person), the ladies served us did really good jobs. It was more than we expected for the money. I don't know about their service about full body massage, but it should be one of the best place for foot massage."

            "review": "On their way of return?. After reading all the good reviews on Tripadvisor I went to this spa for a facial and foot massage + pedicure together with my friend. And I have to say that this was the worst spa experience for me so far.. The foot massage was below average and way too soft. The 'movements' were the same for half an hour in my opinion. The pedicure was also not what I hoped for due to the fact that only too heavy colors were available (such as magenta or fluor orange) and no darker colors (except black) which I prefer. On top of that my nails dont look very neat now.But the worst was definately the facial. For about one hour I had the idea that the girl really did not have any clue about what she was doing. The head massage was no head massage at all and she put for about 4 times the same lotion on my face which dropped in my eyes several times without noticing. What also was very strange is that my eyes werent cleaned during the facial (so my eye make up stayed on?) and that no black spots were removed (although this was in de package I payed for). Worst of all was that the materials werent clear. The headband was dirty even as the bed we layed on and the materials used (which I cant call by name because I did not see these before and the staff couldnt expain what it was for) were smelly. Last but not least I had an allergic reaction on my legs and feet the day after the massage/ pedicure which I never had before. My friends' legs and feet are fine so it might be just bad luck but its strange though."

You are bombarded with many spa / massage offerings in Siem Reap particularly middle aged males.How to find a decent massage is the problem.Pura Vida from their brochure have 7 spas and it is probably just good luck when you find a spa that delivers. I visited Pura Vida 4 located close to Somadevi Hotel in Sivutha Road near to the Hospital Street junction.My masseuse was Number 5 ( her name is Sambath ) I had the anti stress 90 minute. I just wanted it to continue. She has 15 years experience which tells in the way she worked,whilst her english is very limited you can easily communicate about the amount of pressure you wish to be applied to the muscles. Unlike some establishments the table area and privacy are very good where curtains are used unlike many others. The manager was very good to talk to after massage whilst sipping on tea. I think if unsure of your requirements speak to her prior to the massage to establish exactly your requirements.Do tip the masseuse a couple of dollars. The workers are not well remunerated and compared to massages in Australia this was an absolute bargain."

My masseuse didn't speak English well but we were able to chat. She went to town on me and, I must say, my legs have never felt better. She also massaged my head, which nearly put me to sleep.

Not joking, I spent an hour and a half, and $20, being stabbed with a lady's elbow. Even after I said not so much pressure, more than once. No other massage I've ever had involved elbow jabbing, and this can potentially cause muscle tearing based on what I read online. The spa itself is very crowded on pub street, not too relaxing. The cup of tea at the end is a nice touch, as is the foot bath. However, I couldn't enjoy my massage due to the pain and poking.

Those who have high strict hygiene standards should be careful. 1. Pedicure with foot scrub- excellent! The girls did it beautifully, neatly, carefully. Though I did not see any sanitizer for cuticle cutter (sorry, I do not know English word for this :-) ). I love looking at my toes and my extremely dry after 3 weeks of trip feet still feel like baby's.2. Foot massage- the work was mostly done on calves rather than feet, but I loved it! I especially like how the lady worked on my knees- the joints were aching after cycling and climbing stairs in and around Angkor Wat. As I enjoyed the above procedures, I returned the next day for the next ones :-).3. Manicure- the same with sanitizing- never seen it. The cuticle was cut very neatly, nicely, without any pain. But all my nails are of a different length. I repeated a few times to cut my nails, I showed which nail they should be \"equal\" to, but in vain as there was a language barrier and she did not seem to understand when I was using gestures. Then, as I asked for French style, she used extremely old white nail polish and on the 3 nails the lines were with crumbs, uneven and of different width (as the nails were of different length), so I asked her to remove that and just do the base coat without any color. Also, I had to do the filing myself as there were literally pieces of nails sticking out, etc. As the other ladies saw me be unhappy about this job, when time came for my massage, the 5 ladies were fighting who will do it as no one seemed to be willing (although on the previous day I left good tips and when I returned they were quite happy to see me back). So a lady who was cleaning the floor and she was (or seemed ) the oldest went to do my massage. 4. Massage- I asked for one hour head, neck and shoulder massage. She did only half hour but I was charged for an hour. No comprehension when I tried to talk, but I preferred to finish it soon. She was quite good, actually. But again she did back and arms and only 2 minutes spent on my head and neck and only after I insisted that that was what I wanted. Why I did not insist on doing the requested time- hygiene: the room was with 10 or 12 mattresses and 4 people were already there. A person stood up and she put me on the same mat requesting my head on the pillow. I requested to cover a pillow with a towel as someone's hair was there just a minute ago on that pillow. Then as some people were doing Thai massage and wore special robes - that is where my biggest shock was- after the guys returned the robes, the ladies just folded them and put them back on the shelves for next clients. All in all, you will definitely enjoy the massage especially for the price you are paying, but lower your hygiene standards and definitely check the time. "

They are clean, efficient, well spoken, very professional, and most importantly, they give great massages. Both my brother and I received full body massages which were to the highest standard (and neither of us are new to massages by any means). My girlfriend and mother also received foot massages whilst they waited, and expressed these as being of a very high standard too. On top of the quality of service, Pura Vida creates jobs for local Cambodians whilst paying all taxes as foreigners (which are higher than for local businesses). They provide all their staff with free English lessons for the benefit of both the business, but the staff as well, and they even participate in charity events. If you would like a quality beauty & spa treatment, which not only guarantees good service but also contributes positively to the locals, then Pura Vida is the place to go."

The ones in Pub Street were all full when we walked pass. I asked what's the different between Khmer and Thai massage (both oil-free), and she told me Khmer is softer and Thai is harder. I dislike tough massage so I went for Khmer. The concept of massage is almost similar to Thai, e.g. cracking your bones by engaging your body in different positions, but it's indeed a softer touch than Thai. I experienced 2 power failures within one hour of massage, but I suppose it's common in the building. Nonetheless, worth coming here!"

I feel terrible writing a bad review and I try to avoid doing it in most instances because I feel bad that perhaps one employee can provide a business with a bad review, but I really didn't have a good experience and I tried this place twice. I dragged my husband along for a foot massage the first time and he surprisingly enjoyed his (and he isn't a fan of massages, but he gave them 5 stars), so I assumed perhaps I just got a lady who had an off day. My foot massage has left me with bruised and tender legs. During the massage on my shins, it was a little painful, but I have always had sensitive legs and never particularly enjoy that part getting massaged. However because I regularly experience that sensation I didn't think much of it.. But two days later i have bruises and super tender legs which I haven't had before. Still thinking it was my body, I returned for a facial and body massage. These were with two other employees. The facial was good and I enjoyed it. But the massage was horrific. I couldn't let my body relax, it was tense and cramped the entire time in anticipation for what was coming next. I have had a lot of massages in my time and have experienced thai massages too but this was so painful. It felt like she was pressing on bones. My lower back is bruised and sore to even run my fingers over. There was so much yanking and pulling I felt horrible after it. I did tell her to be softer a couple of times but it wasn't the pressure that was the problem, she was just massaging the wrong spots, I don't think she is trained? Also sometimes the towels they use feel like sandpaper! They need to wash them in some fabric softener stat. Again, I feel terrible writing a bad review because I'm sure there are some wonderfully experienced employees who will give you a great massage, but the two I got need some more training. Some positives on the place - they are friendly, the venue is clean and modern. And like I said my husband had a lovely massage."

When I visited him I tried almost all their services and everything was fantastic at a really low price. Also my children were fond of foot massage and they insisted on having one every day after dinner. I liked most Hot Oil massage and traditional Khmer massage. I regularly have massages also at home and if I compare any massage in Pura Vida to any standard European massage all I can say is that you get the same or higher standard massage at a much lower price (10 $ vs. 50$). So, I really recommend Pura Vida treatments whem in Siem Reap in order to enrich your holiday in a really memorable way-sightseeing is enlightning for your soul but tiring for your body and Pura Vida is a balm for your body and for your soul."

The receptionist was friendly and welcomed us in to the parlour where guests were taking foot massage, reclining on the sofas, watching TV mounted on the wall or at thir laptops busy catchin up! We opted for the aromatic oil body massage and were taken up to the second level where we found screened off cabins in a row. The massage was good and no short cuts on time. The oil was taken off without having the need to take a shower or shampoo which was welcome as the bathroom and shower facilities were not upto expectations. We paid Just ten dollars each for a sixty minute body massage, incredibly cheap. No hanky panky of any kind, just plain clean massage done by professionals for about their job quietly, very much appreciated."

We had a decent 30-min foot massage one evening, so we decided to try out a 1-hr khmer massage the next evening. Big mistake. My masseuse was extremely rude and unprofessional the entire time. When I asked for the clothes I needed to change into, she curtly pointed to a bag she had left on the floor and continued to fix/tease her hair in the mirror, rolling her eyes at me. Now I can forgive poor manners if the massage is good (you're paying less than $10 for an hour-long massage afterall), but the massage itself was bloody awful as well. She applied almost no pressure (she was basically just tapping my shoulders), spent the entire time chatting up the other masseuse, and there were multiple times where she wanted to fix her hair, so ended up just massaging with one hand only. When I asked if she could apply a bit more pressure, she got angry and told me I didn't know what a khmer massage was, and then proceeded to nearly rip my skin off with needlessly painful pinching. I had to ask her to tone it down, but it was clear she had done it out of spite. I had bruises on my legs afterwards. Also, since the window faces pub street and they make no effort to minimize the sounds from outside, all you can hear is the masseuses' loud chatting and the pounding music from the bars. If you want to try this place, settle for a 30-min foot massage. Don't waste your money on any full body massage here - I ended up going to Body and Soul a few minutes away for another massage just so I could forget this awful experience."

Girls always talking to each other's without any knowledge of doing a proper foot massage. Putting tons of cream on a leg is definitely not a foot massage. Making face to the customer asking for a proper massage neither. I discussed with the very friendly owner last year but she was not there this time. The workers told me they had plenty other salon (7) and that they where very busy. I understand but beware, something comes up and can come down very quickly, beware, you are on the wrong way !"

I had two massages from Pura Vida at two different locations. and found them to be fine, but it wasn't one of the massages I walked out and went, \"Oh god yes...\" and that is what i am looking for.The one location was on Taphul village , Svay Dangkum Commune, area down the road. It had a nice clean modern look about it. I got a pedicure and a scrub. The pedicure was fine but I am sure to having a bit more of a massage with it.The scrub was fine as well, but again I was expecting more of a massage at first then the scrub which is what I have had in the past when getting any scrub. The real surprise came when towards the end of my massage they brought another guy into the room to get his massage. That is just awkward. No curtains, no nothing. When I was brought in and saw there were two tables I thought that it was for couples and didn't think anything past that. But if you are going to bring two strangers into the same room it only makes sense to have a curtain.The second massage was near Pub Street, but forget the road. It wasn't as modern and sleek looking as their other location but it was clean. I was again shown a room with two tables, but what was shocking was it was a small, I mean really small room. There should have only been one table in there. I probably could have reached the other table with an extended arm. I didn't know how the masseuse would fit between the table and the wall, yet somehow she did. Very squished I am sure, which isn't what I think would make for a good working situation.Again, no curtain, but at least this time no one else came into the room, but the room was right off the main hallway and the masseuse came and went quite a few times. I got a hot stone massage and it seemed she was constantly getting something. A few times she just left the door wide open. I am not one who is too modest, so it was more of a surprise, like the other client who the slotted in with me in the previous location. I don't understand why the door would be left open. Granted I have a sheet over me, so I am covered, but one does still feel a bit exposed and to many I am sure this would have been a deal breaker.The level of english is seemingly just for business. \"Turn over\" \"OK\" \"Done\" just the basics. I do miss that opportunity to say, \"Hey, can you concentrate on my feet a little more\" or \"A bit harder on the shoulders please\" or just to have some pleasantries that I can have in Thailand or the states."

First of all, they ask they you be completely naked for your massage; there's no paper panties or anything.

So pretty much everyone that walked past got a look at the parts of my body that are usually covered by a bathing suit. At one point I was on my back and a woman looked into the room, made eye contact with me. Both she and I were really embarrassed. The masseuse talked to another masseuse for much of the massage. The woman who did mine clearly had no training and was not a massage therapist. My friend who got the same massage had similar complaints -- it was clear that not only did they not know what they were doing, but they didn't really care, either."

I can distinguish good and bad massage very quickly and Puri Vida is not a good one. I had never tried Khmer massage before so I asked the receptionist how it is different from Thai. She replied that the Khmer one is softer and no stretching and she was right. That makes me doubt if there is really an authentic Khmer massage or is it just a tuned down, softer version of Thai massage? For those who like soft, relaxing, but do nothing to your body, Puri Vida is ok. The price for full body Khmer massage for 1 hour is 10 USD which is not overly expensive.The place is well decorated and it looks much better than most Thai massage place of the same price range.It is mostly clean but my wife stepped on a chewing gum right next to the mat. The masseuse kindly removed it from her feet with oil.However, there are several questionable aspects.1. When we arrived on the massage room on the upstairs, 3 masseuses were lying and playing with their phones on the mats.2. The air con wasn't turned on which I understand that it is to save money from electricity bill. Good thing we were there during the cool season. I can imagine it could be pretty warm during summer.3. During the massage I went to the toilet. When I came back, my masseuse was in my mat.4. After we finished and had just changed our clothes back, we saw the masseuse quickly folded our massage shirt and trouser and put it back on the mat ready for next customers without cleaning it at all.5. When we came down the stair, there were staffs sitting on the stairs vanishing her toe nails and having late lunch.The service and staffs are friendly and attentive but it is just not good enough and probably not clean enough.

They tried to sell us the most expensive massage but we took the 1.5h thai/khmer massage instead (thanksfully!). They put me with my colleague in such a small room without curtain between us that I can touch her bed without moving from my bed. The aircon was dying, the bed sheet not changed, the pillow even worse and the two masseuses were talking to each other during the whole massage. Plus, one other masseuse pop up into the room from time to time to check her handphone that was charging there...really?I tried a lot of massages in South East Asia and this was the worse massage experience ever."

Foot and back massage for $25 dollars. Everything was amazing!! My entire body felt reborn after the previous day exploring Angkor. Only complaint is the \"hot aroma oil\" was somewhat warm and I didn't smell anything so if you're just getting one massage save a dollar and the plain oil. Other than that it was perfect!"

The first one was ok (more stroking than massaging) and the second one was excellent. The third time we both got a full body massage with oil. The massage was good but we have a compliant about the noise. We went there at 2 pm and the place was empty. We were taken to the second floor and everything was going fine except that we could hear all of the other workers talking and laughing downstairs. Because the place was empty they didn't have anything to do and were chatting away, which is totally fine, but it doesn't help the people who are having a massage and are trying to relax. Maybe the owners should have doors leading to the place where the massages are given to reduce the noise. However the fact that we came back three times should say that we enjoyed how clean and friendly everyone was."

Complementary green tea to finish was welcomed. Great way to relax in Siem Reap following trekking around Angkor Wat! Would recommend to anyone!"

I was walking around pub street when I saw these comfy looking seats and it was Pura Vida. I got a head, back and shoulder massage for 90 minutes and it was awesome. I'm pretty sure I even partially fell asleep somewhere along the way. The calming music helped a lot too. It was a great retreat from the excrutiating heat. I just wish most of the staff had a better grasp at English. Overall, it was a good experience."

The body scrub smelt and felt great, and my boyfriend said I was 'glowing' after the facial. The facilities are very clean and the women are professional. Be prepared; the body scrub does require you to get naked so if you're not keen on that make sure you let the women know beforehand. Overall, this was a lovely experience!

Their english was limited but there is a manager who can speak english at each shop. We found it quite relaxing as we didn't have to worry about small talk and got to relax and enjoy the massage. Cost was really reasonable, $6 for a 1 hr foot massage and $10-$20 for more of a full body massage. Also loved the foot scrub and I came home with baby feet. We tipped $2-$3 which I think might have been generous but worth it! We ended up going back every day and will definitely go there again when next in Siem Reap."

(Be careful as you don't want them to use it from the tap water.) They just didn't do a good job on each of the different steps. My face ended up breaking out the next day in several places. The pedicure was good. She did a good job of getting the dry skin off my feet. She did only apply 1 coat of polish and no bottom or top coat.Only one girl spoke some English and the rest seemed to rely on her to translate.For the price, I can't complain too much.

This is my first ever review but I felt compelled to write it after the terrible experience I had with Pura Vida.It started out ok, my boyfriend had a thai massage which he said was ok and I had an oil massage which was fine but nothing special. The room was just a dark corridor with beds separated by curtains, not \"spa like\". But all of this would have been fine given the price if it wasn't for my pedicure...After being prodded without much care and feeling nail varnish being applied and taken off 3 or 4 times the girl doing my nails asked another girl to do it. I then watched her pour nail varnish remover into the bottle of nail varnish!! Clearly there wasn't enough nail varnish but she applied it anyway. 5 minutes later she said I was finished and I looked down to see a complete mess.I asked them politely to just take it off and she acknowledged that it wasn't very good. I would still have been satisfied with Pura Vida despite this if it wasn't for what happened next... I went up to pay and she asked for the full amount for the pedicure. I explained very politely I would not be paying for the pedicure. She then LIED to me by saying the pedicure was the same price without colour anyway which was not what she told me when I first arrived and enquired about prices. When I said this she laughed and said something in Cambodian to another staff member - she knew exactly what price she had given me. Then she said, \"ok $3 for pedicure\". I wasn't going to argue over such a small amount but I explained this was very bad service considering they had taken almost an hour to do a very bad pedicure and they knew it. Unsurprisingly she didn't respond to this and just took our money.Very dishonest to lie about what prices she had given me at the start and terrible customer service to still charge when they know they were in the wrong and did a bad job. Avoid going to places like this that don't treat customers well when there are plenty of similar places in Siem Reap that will!"

I kept trying to pretend I was somewhere else to try and relax - NOT what should happen during a massage!! My forehead was knotted, and I was doing yoga breathing to try and calm down. My friend was supposed to have a shiatsu massage ... It was definitely not shiatsu. He kept having to ask the woman to use a softer, gentler touch ... She had no idea what she was doing.

I dont mind the money, but to give me a lousy massage is the last thing i want. There are mosquitos in the room, the toilet is in bad shape and the masseuse kept wiping me with a cold wet towel throughout the massage at 2200! I got a cold after that.When I complained to the cashier before I paid, she told me that antistress was not the strongest! It was the thai. So this was in fact contradictory to the one presented to me by the customer service before i agreed to use service. Both ended up arguing in Khmer and I told them, look i will pay for the normal massage fees to settle this cos we were upset to be wasting our time.Instead, i suggest you use the spa at the end of pub street, nearer to Elephant Terrase Hotel side, named Therapy Massage Center who does excellent foot wash and great massage. Two hours only cost $10 except for oil massage, it is USD$14. They serve you cool nice tea after the massage. The massueses are polite, focus in their work and professional."

When to Puravita(in pub street) for body massage tonight.Guess I should take those negative commends more serious...Room was hot like hell? Check!Staff broke in while you changing cloths? Check!Massage your feet and then massage your face without washing hands? Check!!!And toilet's door is broken, can't close at all, and the massage room is full of strange perfume smell, never appreciate that.Don't know if its every puravida are horrible or just the puravida on the pub street is the worst one.In the end, the therapist told me I should get change in the changing room, problem is I already changed and the changing room has no light, I maybe wear my pants inside out.But after all, it's only $6/hr, what else I expect for?"

I got a foot massage and a shoulder/head/arm massage all for $8 total, which is a great price. My sister and her fianc\u00e9 got a Thai massage that they said was ok - can't remember how much but it was cheap. I do know that they had your change into their pura vida clothing for the massage. You leave your shoes at the front and they give you these slipper (which I feel is pretty standard) but I didn't wear them - I preferred to be barefoot when I was finished. When you first sit down, they give you this cold hand towel to cool yourself off and what not, which was nice but it smelled funny - like moldy towel but then it's like they tried to cover that smell with a perfume. So it smelled like a wet, moldy towel with flowers. My foot massage was great. My provider was very nice, smiled a lot as there was a language barrier. My head/shoulder/arm massage was ok. I could have told her it was too hard but I think I was focused on figuring out \"can I handle it?\" Or \"it's not that bad.\" So that's my fault. But I did end up getting bruised around my temples on my head. So again, my fault. This place didn't seem luxurious but when you're getting two services for $8, you can't complain much. Also, my head/shoulder massage was supposed to be 1 hour but I only wanted a 30 minute foot massage and a 30 minute head/shoulder massage so they did accommodate for me and cut the price according to time, which was nice So overall, it wasn't bad but I wasn't super impressed. I probably would try out another spa and pay more. "

I regretted not backing out from this unsightly setup. Then, the therapists just stood behind me while I changed. I told my wife that maybe the massage itself warranted the high TripAdvisor ratings. Wrong again! My therapist displayed the worst combination of ineptitude and lethargy. I think she assumed that I was asleep and felt that she could get away with pressing and rubbing muscles randomly. I told her to apply stronger force and she complied but only for a stretch. At times she would completely pause and chat and giggle with other therapists, which is blunt display of bad manners. The only positive in this experience is that I originally intended to go for a two-hour treatment but thankfully, evaded another hour of my life (and $7) going to waste!"

The Khmer massage is not too dissimilar to a Thai massage but very much follows 'lines'; my preference is for Khmer.They have male and female staff, but I cannot say whether you can guarantee a male masseur. Both times were excellent and thanks to Sok Na and Mr Korn for their work. We would both recommend visits here"

We got there and it was quite busy with people getting pedicures and I feel like they just didn't want to lose a customer so I'm pretty sure they gave me the receptionist instead of a masseuse. He concentrated on only one side of my back (coincidentally, not the sore side), and would keep pausing seeming to think of what to do next. When he massaged my shoulders it was just like when your friends gave you a massage in school and then he would randomly keep massaging one arm?? I felt quite uncomfortable at times when he would push down and pause then tap/stroke my back, I kinda cringed away and he'd stop but it was really uncomfortable. He then asked me to lay my head in his lap (??) while he utterly failed in his attempt at a face massage. I'm not very good at confrontation and I didn't know how to leave without being rude so I had to wait it out. When he finally finished I went to pay, a flier I got the day before said it was $5 but the board inside said $7, so I paid two meals for an awkward hour and a much sorer neck than beforehand."

Went in feeling fine and left with a very bad pain in the center of my back. Had a hot oil massage that was supposed to be relaxing by definition. She was rougher then a sports massage. In addition, the ladies doing the massage are all laughing and talking during the massage. Relaxing? No way!!!!! It was hot, noisy and unprofessional employees. Find a better place."

After hours of walking and wandering around Pub Street and the night market, I decided to go to any local massage parlours / spas, then I saw this one tiny spa called Pura Vida.By the time I reached there, it was already 11.30pm and I was told that it closes at 12pm. As I had only 30 minutes left before the closing time, I decided to get a 30-min foot massage.I was entertained by a male masseur named Jan, who has a very pleasant look and smile. And yes, his service was beyond satisfactory! I truly enjoyed my 30-min there.Whoever comes to Siem Reap, this is a must go place. A good place to pamper yourself. Awesome!"

It cost USD 6 for a whole hour of bliss. They offer fantastic packages for facial treatments as well, are one of the few places to visit for an eyelash tint, and offer services ranging from all kinds of massages to body scrubs and nail design.I can't wait to go back for more treatments! Highly recommended, as I am very picky about massages (been in the country for 10 years) and can tell immediately if someone knows what they're doing!Please plan a pampering experience at Pura Vida on your visit!"

Although we were served by different massage therapists each time, all of them were consistently well trained and professional. They were also warm and friendly with no attempts to hard sell, so we were always put at ease. The place is simple and welcoming and my friend and I enjoyed ourselves immensely. We would recommend pura vida to any traveller looking for great, no nonsense massages at excellent value."

If you want Cambodian cheap then please feel free to be gawped at by passers by as someone pummels you whilst you are sat at the pavement! This was the perfect counterpoint: plinky music, comfy seats, and your feet washed. Be prepared to climb ladderesque staircases as most treatment rooms are squirrelled away above the local laundry, but the spa was spotless throughout, my masseur was attentive and careful after I explained an old injury. I had 1 HR Khmer aromatherapy massage and was transported to nirvana for $18 - I can't get an express manicure in the Uk for that!!! Perfect bliss - awkun!"

Good reception, nice decor, delicious aromas in the air and the location of the spa is very central. The main reason for the 3 stars is the technique of the massage which I think was not very good. I think I was not lucky and got a not so experienced masseuse. At some moments there was noise coming in from the street (loud motorbike) which was a bit distracting but it was again maybe bad luck because the street is relatively quiet for the location."

The massages are a little pricier (compared to what you would normally get in Siem Reap) but really worth every penny! We went twice. I opted for the Khmer dry massage (one hour) on both occasions and my friend tried the Khmer & slimming oil massage. We both loved our massages! My masseuse was SreyKa on the first day and she was so very attentive & I tried asking for her on my next visit but she was not yet in work at the time & I was attended to by her colleague who was good but not as great as SreyKa. I paid just under $14 for a one hour Khmer massage. Kampuchea & SreyKa are definitely recommended!Note: A tip is usually recommended at all spas in Siem Reap & I personally find these girls so hardworking that regardless of the massage, I usually tip. It just makes me happy & I hope it gives them incentive to do good work."

We were only in our underwear as we chose the oil massage, but you do not feel uncomfortable at all. We chose a full body massage there is relaxing music playing in the background. The first day we paid $38 US for both and as returning clients we got 15% off our next bill. We made a slight mistake and had a foot massage off the street for $3 each and it was disgusting.

Also, our feet were washed in scented water and we received new sandals for walking around the spa.The deep tissue massage was good. I doubted, for one moment, this petite woman could unlocked my muscles. 3 minutes in, all doubts were cask aside. She did a good job locating and working out the kinks, while providing a relaxing experience. There is also very heavy scented water bowls in the room that heighten the experience. The 60 minutes flew by and we left with another set of tea and cool washcloths.Yes, you will pay more for this massage than others, but this quality and the experience are superior as well.Please note: it is by no means a luxury experience."

When we showed up they were ready for us with a welcome drink and asked if we wanted to share a room or have our own one - we opted to share. I opted for the aromatherapy massage. We both then experienced a hour of heaven - the young women therapists could not have been more professional, skilled and thoughtful - and I am a qualified massage therapist and have had many massages. The treatments are incredibly cheap - admittedly you can get cheaper if you are prepared to take a risk on untrained therapists and share a room with a load of smelly tourists - my recommendation is GO TO THE KAMPUCHEA!"

They do not take credit cards - FYI. And you can hear the thumping music from the bar next door. The massage was ok.

A cup of tea and welcoming hosts on arrival; relaxing, quiet and peaceful environment. We chose 1 hour traditional Khmer massage. Cambodian pants and shirts were provided. As a couple we had a massage in the same room which felt nice. Massage felt reaaaally good, firm but not too strong, ladies were respectful and professional the whole time.After we got a 15% discount coupon for the next time but finally couldn't use it, and I reallt regret I didn't come back!Don't go to those \"two dolla\" street massage spots 'cause you'll be disappointed.De Kampuchea offers a professional service at reasonable prices and we left with a feeling that at least we got a proper massage! I definitely recommend it!"

We had a later appt time of 9.30 pm to fit in with dining etc. Upon arrival we welcomed with a tea and were given a foot soak. We were invited to select an oil for our massage. There was a choice of many; Jasmine,ginger, ylang ylang, lavender,rosemary,eucalyptus and some others I forget.We we then shown into the treatment room and asked to place our clothing in a small basket and cover ourselves under a towel. My husband and I were in the same room which was nice. Soft tranquil music playing and dim lights help to create a relaxing atmosphere.The treatment then began. A lovely time to relax and unwind. Dignity was maintained throughout. There are a choice of 60 or 90 mins of massage. We opted for the latter which seemed to fly by. Front and back of body covered.Bring something to tie your hair back with, as I didn't. Fortunately the therapist found a band. A wonderful experience .If you have enough time during your stay in Siem Reap then treat yourself to this very reasonably priced massage. $20 US dollars each. Bliss as my husband said!!!"

You have to make a small turn at an alley in 7 street. But once you turned, and find that alley, the spa is the first door you see. Once you get inside, the staff is welcoming and very professional.They will give you your options for treatment and once you choose, you follow the therapist upstairs. One thing though that will put off those with limited mobility is the stairs. It's a bit narrow and per floor they have about 2-3 private rooms. That can accommodate 9 customers at a time. Fortunately, when I arrived, they weren't full. For me when I arrived, the massage was okay. Basically, I was so tired from going up and down the temples the whole day that the massage was relaxing and I fell asleep on my second hour due to fatigue. However the first hour that I was awake, I had the aromatherapy massage and I have to say it's okay. Not great like what I was expecting but not bad also. In defense to my therapist, she was trying and she was very professional about it. During the second hour I had a facial and I tuned out everything and just fell asleep. I just woke up when the therapist said we were finished. Therefore I can't comment on the facial due to the fact that I slept.When I came downstairs, they have a small snack of mango and tea prepared for me. Not bad. For $42 for 2 hours, their massage is a bit pricey because you can get a 2 hour massage outside for below $20. However, for the quality of service, it's okay and what counts s you're relaxed afterwards."

I've never had a body scrub before, and although she asked permission, it caught me off guard when she pulled the towel down to scrub my chest, but she was very professional and somehow it wasn't awkward. It helped that my eyes were covered. She sent me to shower after the scrub and then did my facial. The whole place is extremely clean and professional.I highly recommend this spa and the package.

You just have to keep an eye out for their sign and walk down an alleyway to the door.We were greeted by friendly staff and offered tea and a cold towel, we chose our massages and were led to another room.It had felt as if 10 maybe 20 minutes had passed when then kind lady put her hands together and told us that she was finished, but realistically over 2 hours had passed, I'd been rubbed, scrubbed, stretched, prodded and wrapped up in aloe vera.I had gone for one of their packages as I'm one of those people that can't say no to anything and why wouldn't I want to be swapped up in aloe vera after an aromatherapy massage?Anyway, the place is small and cute and they actually know what they're doing, it's worth the extra money if you want to actually come away feeling amazing."

We opted for the sun package which is perfect when travelling as there is an aloe vera body wrap. The ladies massaging you are delicate and always ensuring that we are well. You lose the notion of time during the three hours. At the end of the spa, they offer you a warm drink and slices of mango and honestly that's the cherry on the top. "

They used fresh cucumber to cool my face after the facial, and the body scrub made my skin feel soft and supple. I absolutely recommend this spa!!

There are nice showers in the rooms too, the whole place looked nice. The price is amazing and we were so happy we went back, plus our second time there we had 20% discount. Loved it.

This included an aromatherapy massage, mango body scrub and facial. The spa setting was very relaxing and professional and we were given drinks and cold towels/mango on arrival and departure. The massage itself was the highlight of treatment with our therapists working deep to remove knots from our tired muscles. The scrub started off relaxing but a problem with the water supply meant the showers had stopped working so we had to get washed down with a bucket. This wouldn't have been a problem if the staff had communicated the problem whilst we were left waiting on the beds for a while hearing strange water sounds and were left to wonder what was going on. However, things picked up again with the facial which was extremely relaxing and left us drifting off into a light sleep. Overall would definitely recommend as the service and setting was good but the management should take a note about communicating issues to customers if these arise in future."

The massage therapists had very good massage techniques, one of the best massages I had for a long time.When we did the Mango wrap, one of us felt itch at the back, probably because of sensitive skin. But the massage therapist helped him remove the wrap and he took a shower to wash off the residue immediately and he didn't get anymore itchiness. In addition, they even offered to change his remaining time to massage instead of using the wrap. Very very good service and helpful. Hence, despite the itchiness, we felt cared for and still cant recommend Khmer Relief Spa enough.Very reasonably priced and right at the Old Market area. Extremely convenient.One minor point to take note is that the massage therapists did not know much English. Hence if there are emergencies like being sensitive skin, there is a need to use some hand signals to talk to them, or perhaps as the reception to translate.Overall, it was very very wonderful and would definitely be my go to spa in Siem Reap!"

I had a 2 hour session (1 hour aromatherepy and 1 hour body scrub with Head massage) which cost about USD$43. It was one of the best spa experience i had and i wished i found this place earlier. It wasn't easy to locate as it is not along the main road and you would have to walk around a bit more to find it. But when you find it, i am sure you will have a great time inside. I requested for a male masseur and Da was very good at his job. Strong, Slow and Smooth strokes that really helped my aching back and sore muscles. He took his time and the environment was very conducive. He was also friendly and up for a chat if you would like to know more about the local culture. Despite his limited English, he does his best to check that the service/massage provided was satisfactory. My female friends were also raving at how good the massage was and everyone was just very professional. The environment was very conducive and I love that they had proper showers for us to use as well. Music and temperature was on point. It was pricey but worth every cent. Definitely worth a visit to pamper yourself and i just wished i found this place earlier during my trip."

My husband and I had gotten a massage earlier from a dingy looking place down the street from our villa, and at $15 we thought it would be pretty decent, but it sucked. So for this next massage, I wanted to make sure it was a good one. I saw indistinct sign and arrow pointing down an alleyway and took a chance. The interior was beautifully decorated and calming. The owner was a pleasure to talk to, and even though I didn't make an appointment and they were quite busy, he assured me the wait wouldn't be too long but advised for an appointment next time.The facility through and through is perfectly well kept and presentable. The masseuse actually spoke English and asked my pressure preference, and checked in with me while I got my massage. I chose the herbal compress and it was so soothing and an amazing experience. I felt so refreshed and taken care of!! The bonus? The delicious sweet mango treat they give you after the massage!The chat with the owner was so humbling and you can tell he takes pride in his business. I was happy to discover this place ranked very high on TripAdvisor. He granted me a discount card for my next visit, so of course I brought my husband the next day.The following day I had a Balinese massage and my husband had a stress-reliever massage (upper body only), and we were both extremely pleased with our masseuses and massages. I would highly recommend this place - you may pay a bit more than those \"massage places\" but don't waste your time! Your body deserves it!"

Was only a bit difficult to find since it's not on the Pokombor Avenue, as indicated. Instead, it's in a side street of the 7th street, which is parallel with pub street. You'll see the sign if you just walk down 7th street."

The end we got approx. 70 minutes, instead of 90. When we I for the reception staff about the situation, the therapists insisted that we were provided with 90 minutes, lucky we took picture of the room ( just for fun) before we for changed and there's time stamp on the picture. Though it was style with them charging us for 60 minutes instead of 90 minutes, but it was really a shame that this happened to supposedly thr best spa in town."

I was guided into the spa with my eyes closed, it was a suprise that we would go here, and I wasn't expecting this at all. But when I came in, having my eyes closed, I could already smell the lovely oils, so I already had some suspicions where we were. When I opened my eyes, I saw we were at the Khmer Relief Spa. I had never been here before, but straight away I felt comfortable. The staff was very friendly and the entrance is very calm and nicely decorated. The whole experience from then on was great. Before the massage we got something to drink, and cold towels to freshen up. The massage in my eyes was very professional and really good. It was exactly what my sore and stiff body needed after the long trip. Also, the room looks very clean, the towels and the massage bed were nice and soft. After the massage I felt very relaxed and we enjoyed the tea and mango downstairs. Overall it was a great experience, and I would defenitely come back here!"

My mum is a beauty therapist and masseuse herself so I have always found it difficult to take her to a salon to enjoy either a massage or just a simple manicure as the standards have never lived up to the standards of customer service and care that she requires in her own salon.

We were introduced to a private couple room with shower. Room was a little tight but clean and cozy with individual room air conditioner. We were asked to take off all clothes but provided disposable black meshed see-through panties. Panty area was covered with towels during the massage. Shower room attached to the private room was clean but no warm water was served. We had to take a shower with cold water after our bodies were cooled down, which were a bit of torture. Quality of the massage was good for me, but no good for my wife. The quality of the massage should be depending on the therapist, but better location should have better therapists."

There are four different types of oils to choose from which is a good range.After choosing from the menu, we were then quickly ushered into the room for a change. The massage itself was definitely done by trained therapists with good pressure but I did not think they were extremely outstanding as I had obvious problems with certain parts of my back but these were not taken care of much. The therapists did not chatter amongst themselves despite me being in the same room as my mum which is good and professional conduct. We were served drinks and fruit after, common in other places as well.The entire experience was fuss free, professional and relaxing but lacking of that wow factor that I had read about. Yes, it does the job if you're looking for a routine done by skilled hands. But there are better options at this price point if you really want a darn good session that actually takes care of specific needs after which you can feel a difference in your condition."

If your focused is not on getting the cheapest then you wont be disappointed in paying that little bit more (but still 10 x cheaper than at home) for this fantastic professional experience. The venue is down a small alley and this is a positive in terms of quietness. The staff are professional and welcoming as is the atmosphere. It's all separate rooms, with gentle soothing background music and the rooms are cool without being cold. My masseuse had definitely had some good training, he knew what he was doing, recognised my problem points and worked on them. He made sure I was comfortable and there was no answering phones or unnecessary chatter. The whole experience was soothing and peaceful, complete with a welcoming cool drink and finishing with a lovely hot tea and fruit. Definitely worth more than one visit."

Service was far more than expected. I filled out a comment card after my first visit and received a VERY fast reply. Rarely in Asia have I EVER seen such a fast reply! This place is a little pricey BUT. You are guarantee a great massage. This is a fact. Siem Riep is a get what you pay for city. For travelers and genuine tourists this is the place. If you are a backpacker go down the road. It's not a budget massage place. So don't waste your time. When I come back to siem riep I will come back.

I often travel to Cambodia which offers many massage places from the cheapest, the most curious and adventurous but when you really looking to pamper yourself or indulge yourself with a SPA treatment a couple of places remains on your menu. Khmer Relief Spa is one of those couple of places to hand professionally handle. I often go for a Swedish massage with a strong pressure, the therapist(s) I had is (are) all fully qualified to make a 90 minute moment being somehow too short. A must place to try, not only for a Swedish massage experience, the classic aromatherapy has, for example, other relaxing virtues."

She followed the lines of the muscles, used the most wonderful smelling massage oil, and was very professional. She made sure I was comfortable the entire time and checked in to make sure that the pressure was perfect. The location is vey centrally located near the Old Market, but set back from the busy street so the noise is not an issue. When you first arrive they give you tea and a cool towel to help you relax and get comfortable after sweating outside in the humidity of Siem Reap. Post massage you are again given tea and a bit of mango! So delicious.Unlike other places in Siem Reap where you lay in a room with other people and, if you are lucky, have a curtain around your area, at Khmer you have a private room with soothing music and AC. They pay attention to detail and even have a pot with water and lotus flowers under the headrest so you have something soothing to look at if you do not want to close your eyes during the massage. The prices are a bit higher than the advertised $5 massage parlors lining the streets, but you get what you pay for and Khmer is extremely reasonably priced for the service, atmosphere, and quality!I cannot say enough great things about Khmer Relief Spa! I am definitely going back ASAP!"

The facilities are nice, though not exactly five star, but that is hardly the point as everything else is done just right. The masseurs are obviously very well trained, among the best I have had in Siem Reap. The price is higher than some places but you get what you pay for which is a wonderful experience from start to finish. In my experience here, if you try to cut corners and save a dollar or two, you suffer as a result. My adage here is you get what you pay for. And at Khmer Relief you get a great massage in a charming atmosphere with every attention to detail."

My boyfriend and I shared a couple's room for our 2-hour spa package consisting of 1 hour of Swedish massage and another hour of facial. My masseuse did a good job, but my boyfriend felt his was just satisfactory. Our facials were not the type you would expect back home. The exfoliation was much too gentle, and there was no extraction at all. I did my own extraction a couple nights later and squeezed out a whole load of junk. In terms of ambience, our masseuses kept talking to each other, and there was non-stop construction noise in the background, so there was no romantic ambience to speak of.All in all, I would recommend the massage, but not the facial."

The service was exceptional! I had the Vitamin Rich facial which was amazing. My skin is still glowing! The therapist was very skilled and professional. This spa is a much higher standard than other spas in Siem Reap and great value for money."

We had tea and shifted out of our wet shoes into offered sandals. We chose 90m Swedish massage and 60m salt scrub. Once completed, we immediately knew we were coming back. With one day left in Cambodia, we booked for the next day. We again chose a 90m Swedish massage and the 60m aloe wrap (to smooth our sunburned shoulders and legs) We requested the same therapists as day prior. The guys were great, so professional, talented, and well trained in the craft. We left, both days, in a state of nirvana. All knots in muscles were released and our skin was glowing. Thank you very much Khmer Relief Spa and team. Keep up the good work"

The room we were led to was nice and private but the massage was literally one hour of rubbing their hands up and down your leg and foot. Although I specified medium to hard, it was neither. Just rubbing. Overall, didn't feel any different to when I walked in. Would try somewhere else."

Khmer Relief Spa had me floating on clouds after I got their rice body scrub. I left feeling smoother than I ever have, and smelling absolutely delicious! This is also the first place that put something pretty to look at under the face pillow (normally where you're just staring at the ground - they put bowls with flowers floating in water - it was a nice touch).The woman was very polite and professional (as everyone there was - I received an excellent welcome, even at 9.30pm), and she applied just the right amount of pressure. For a body scrub you don't want it ground into your tender flesh. I also have a healing wound on my knee which she was very attentive about not hurting. After the scrub, she turned the shower on, and that was also a real pleasure. It finished with a light facial massage.On my way out they gave me a pot of tea and fresh mango. An A+++ experience and I look forward to returning!"

I badly needed a good massage after a long day of walking and decided to check out my shortlist of massage spas which I have prepared prior to my trip. Khmer was the first on my list and so decided to call them to make a reservation - and was informed that they are available.Showed my driver the name and address, my driver informed me he has not heard of this spa (which I was rather surprised) but he knows where is Street 11. Ended up, we went round in circles before I decided to call the spa staff again. It is actually located at Street 11, between Pokambor Avenue and Street 9 (opposite Old Market) and tucked away between 2 shops - No wonder we cannot locate it! End up, Spa staff rode his bike over to pick me up.Initially wanted to take up 2hours package but was informed that they are closed at midnight, so I can only take the 1hour package (why didn't he inform me over the phone?).Told the masseur I needed to wash my feet, as I got sprayed with muddy water along the way and she told me she can clean for me, just lie on the bed (I was like - my feet is dirty and you want me to dirty the bed I'll be lying on???). Decided to ignore that and proceed to wash my feet first - she seemed a little unhappy I washed somehow, not sure why.The massage was good - was placed in a room with 3 beds (it is those high beds, not mattresses on the floor kind) and they even put in effort to place decorative pot of flower which you can see through the head-hole portion. Masseur stepped out of the room for me to undress and again at the end, when I went to the adjoining showers - very professional and no invasion of privacy (especially since the showers can be seen from the room). The reasons why I rate a 4 instead of 5:1) Had a hard time looking for the place (wasted at least 15mins)2) Staff did not inform me about only 1 hours available3) Had the best massage in SR at Bodia (nearby) and Khmer Relief Spa is 2nd to Bodia to be honest - but do note there's price difference as Bodia is slightly more upmarket.4) The plus point was that the massage was really good, and was served with hot tea and wet towel upon arrival.I would still say it was worth the trip to Khmer Relief Spa."

Proper spa, clean, a/c, relaxing music, uniformed staff... but a small problem too. Prices were starting 25$ and up for an hour of massage. We thought its bit too much considering we r in Siem Reap and started exiting. Then they said couples get half price. So we went in. And OMG, we discovered heaven. Proper massage by two ladies and all that for 12$ per person. Been going there since and never looked back. Second best massage in my life and believe me, I've been around.

There is quite a proliferation of massage services/spa's in Siem Reap (some of the more down market places are somewhat dubious with staff sat on the street outside trying to drum up trade.But KRS is certainly in an entirely different class to these. Sat on the perimeter road of the Old Market you feel relaxed as soon as you enter and the young but very professional owners ofer advice with no pressure, and I found the treatments ( I have returned on a number of occasions) to be given by the well trained staff very efficiently. Certainly the service and venue is of as high a standard of some of the larger and more expensive spa's in Siem Reap. Well doen and keep up the good work. I will be back soon."

I have had an aromatherapy and four hands massage, both of which were great but the four hands really is a great sensory experience!

The ambiance is serene, the staff highly trained, and the massages what you would expect from the much higher priced spas in town. I am lucky to live and work in Siem Reap, a city with many high-quality spa treatment centers. It was my good fortune to find Khmer Relief's location, shortly after they opened. The spa is tucked down a safe,charming little alleyway near the Old Market which most Tuk Tuk drivers will have no problem finding.Take the time for a massage while you are visiting Siem Reap. Long days of sightseeing are tailor-made for a relaxing massage or spa treatment from Khmer Relief SpaTheir massage is sublime."

Managed by Both Dara and Borey, The Khmer Relief Spa is in the heart of Siem Reap, close to the Old Market and other major attractions in the township that is Siem Reap!! The Spa is spotlessly clean and upon entering the door, one is graciously welcomed into a calm reception area with light music playing in the background; It also smells divine. One is then offered cold iced towels along with iced tea and ridded of one\u2019s foot attire which are replaced by a pair of clean flip flops. A well versed (in English) therapist explains the menu of treatments, which is very extensive and offers a variety of massages and beauty treatments.... All applied by some of their great therapists, Lo lim, Yin Bunthet and Houn Khemaren.... just to name a few! Post treatment one is taken back to the reception area and served hot tea and freshly sliced mango!! It's the perfect way to end the treatment! (Also and a good to know, most of the treatment rooms have their own showers Spotlessly Clean and with shower gel and shampoo) and they are also one of the few spas in town that has a treatment room with three massage tables and also with its own wet area!) Prices are also excellent\u2026. Certainly worth a visit post that of walking around the Temples of Angkor, or indeed the streets, alleyways and lane-ways of Siem Reap!!! Do try it out!!!"

No lag time, I hardly feel any waiting/ wasting time in the 180 minutes spa package. The only odd part was the 15 minutes body brushing. It felt unnecessary. Perhaps it was too gentle?

On our first visit my friend and I each opted for the Kmer massage for 90 minutes - when in Cambodia try the local style. The massage is done without lotion or oil, you where basically scrubs for the whole experience. It was a good experience but definitely a very in tense massage with use of fists, elbows, knees so you need to like that style. The masseuse was very good and checked in a few times to check pressure. I'm glad I tried it and it was a deal at $40 including tip. Visit 2 we went back armed with a coupon for 15% off or a free extension of any massage from 60-90 min. We chose the head and neck massage option and they were really helpful about reviewing the different massage styles and recommending based on out chief aches. They customized to add arms to mine. The massage was fantastic! The lemon grass oil smelled amazing and I have tendinitis in my arm and record maybe the best most psi relieving massage ever for that and I try to go monthly when at home. Total cost for the 60 min $26. Don't settle for the $12 massages on the street from open stores in a chair get the full spa treatment here it's worth it!"

Staff are very polite and sweet. The room was spacious, clean, morden, with nice atmospher which i felt safe and relax. Khemer massage was similar to stretching, it releases my gulte from all the walking, and my stiff shoulders after carrying my heavy back pack for a whole day. Staff are very professional, they were focus and quiet. Unlike some places they will started talking and laughing and makes you hard to relax. I did not try their aroma therapy but they do have a good varities in terms of oil scent selection.After the massage they gave me a cup of nice hot ginger drink and fresh mango. Special thanks to Ms Savai and Ms kunthea, they are the one with magic hands.I will definitely recommend this place to all my friends. I would like make a little effort to share my experience in Siem Reap to help their tourist business.

The room had a shower so I was able to clean up. They also give you some PJs to wear. I don't think you would wear these if having an oil type massage.Rado was my therapist. He's small in stature, so I let him know I liked my massage firm, big mistake. Rado has hands of steel! I quickly let him know was a bit too firm and he lightened up. He did check with me throughout to make sure the pressure was ok.He worked from feet to head starting on my back. He found some stress point on me.He also did some stretching. Then turn over for the same on the front.I was very disappointed when the massage ended. Didn't want it to stop.Great relaxing, clean and well decorated place.

There is a form to complete so you can indicate if you have any specific issues and what intensity massage you require. Initially your feet are gently washed in bowls of warm water with lemongrass and lime slices whilst you enjoy a relaxing drink. You are then escorted to the treatment room where you are left to remove all - and I do mean- all your clothes and lie face down on the treatment table swathed in towels.You are then oiled, kneaded, pressed, pulled in every direction possible - my masseuse used her forearms as well as hands. She moved around every area of my body pummelling and stretching and then applied a body scrub. Following this you go into the shower in the room and remove the scrub - your body really feels so soft after that . I'm not sure how well any tan would survive after the scrub ! The facial is a joy with cleansing, warm compresses, eye pads - it goes on - I have to admit I fell asleep during the facial - my snoring woke me up ! There is a head massage which I found painful - was very relieved when that was over ! I had chosen ginger oils for my particular treatment, but, to be honest I was not aware of any prevailing smell - such as you would notice at home.It was reasonably priced, think I paid about $64 for the total 3 hours - I had a Swedish massage . There's very little conversation , but, that's absolutely fine with me - but, the masseuse did check every now and again that I was comfortable. Just be aware that it is quite an invasive massage and some ladies might be a little unnerved - enough said !"

Picked up by tuk tuk with a representative of the spa to ride with me and chat about various sights that we passed. Tea and a lovely foot spa with fresh lemon and herbs and sugar scrub to begin. Selection of essential oils for your massage and a consultation about focus areas for massage.The decor is perfect, really relaxing and quite trendy. Wonderful massage itself, with lovely masseuse who I tipped. I got the Swedish massage which was really good. Amazing shower afterwards, I was so blissed out I almost forgot where I was.My only complaint was that I was so blissful and relaxed that I was not prepared for the hectic tuk tuk ride home and felt like a newborn launched into the world! But that isn't really a complaint and more a testament to their wonderful spa.My massage was 7pm and halfway through I did start to hear the bass from next door but it wasn't overly distracting or loud enough to drown out the nice spa music. But if that would really bother you, just have your massage before 7pm. And I think it's something fairly unavoidable if you want a centrally located spa."

I first tried Sokhak Spa during a holiday over New Year's 2015 and I had the best massage of my life! Naturally when I moved here I thought I would try a few other places, but none compared to Sokhak. If you have kinks and sore myscles and need a strong massage, ask for Ms. Yok. If you want to relax and float off into bliss, ask for Ms. Kraob. Either way, the most beautiful atmosphere and most professional massages I have ever had. And that's coming from someone who has been getting them for over a decade in Asia. Sokhak Spa...Highly, highly recommended...I now go there once a week!"

I went to this one because my first choice was not available so I tried Sokkhak by chance, simply because it was on my walking route. What a great choice it was, too. Everything about the place, from the moment I walked in, was perfect. The d\u00e9cor is simple and elegant, the music [western classical] added to the atmosphere at a volume that was not intrusive. A warm welcome was followed by helpful explanations of the menu and suggestions, without being intrusive. My details were taken to ensure I had no medical conditions, whilst enjoying a drink and a cold towel for my brow. The actual massage room is very private, professionally furnished and there is a private shower too. I bought one of the packages that included massage and scrub. The masseur was pleasant, very professional and the actual massage was excellent. I can\u2019t praise it too highly and will definitely make a return appointment next week when I am back in the city.

We were then taken to an air conditioned room, where we were offered a shower before our Massage. Good idea since it's very hot here. Also included were a shower cap (so the oil will not ruin your hair) and disposable undies, for the massage. After our massage was finished, we were served warm tea and melon.

The setting is beautiful and calming. You are greeted with a tray of tea and hot cloths. They will remove your shoes and begin by washing your feet in a lotus-filled basin. You can choose from a menu of different massage styles. Khmer style is very similar to Thai. They also have other services, such as facials. When you are finished with your massage, they will bring you another drink and sliced mango. This was my third visit, and I will definitely return."

We decided to go back to the Spa the next day but the 2nd experience was awful - first of all they didn't dry my wife's feet properly, and when she asked for a clean towel to dry off herself, they gave her a dirty towel.

We were greeted and all given a nice foot bath before we were offered a tray of different scents of massage oils to choose. Each scents' properties were explained to us. After selecting a scent, we were shown a room which had 2 massage beds each along with an open shower area and a sink. Unfortunately, there is not any privacy in the room to change out of your clothes.Especially nice are the small touches and attention to detail. Underneath each massage table is a basin with floating flowers. This, along with the dimness, the dark woods and the overall quietness of the spa really helps ease your tensions away.I opted for a 4-hand massage, and although the ladies did not focus on getting any knots out, they did have adequate pressure and did an overall good job. After our massage, the owner offered to arrange dinner for us at their partner restaurants along with prepaid transportation via tuk tuk. This is such a great option as my brain usually is still in a fog after a massage and I could barely comprehend anything other than the fact that I was relaxed and getting hungry."

The treatment itself is worth 5 stars, but unfortunately the spa is located next door to a pretty loud music venue, so when you go make sure you book your treatments to be done by 9pm when the music starts."

The tranquil setting is an oasis from the street's hustle bustle; the welcome drink, cold towel and foot wash are thoughtful and refreshing; the massage itself was professional, thorough and relaxing; the tea and mango are a wonderful ending.

They offer spa packages that involve Swedish massage, body scrubs, facials... (180mins) for $60 USD. Really can't beat it! Perks: A) offer cold towel and water when you enter and are looking at the menuB) they scrub your feet with lime and mango bath. Really nice! C) after massage you are fed lemon grass tea and mango slices! I opted for the 60min foot reflexivety massage and it was fantastic. My masseuse was firm and rhythmic. Upward motions towards the heart pressure point work really gave my feet a break from the pounding they get from all those temple tours! Haha! "

Rushed here after having an awful reflexology experience in the bright green chairs in pub St. Also had amazing pumpkin scrub at The Aviary hotel spa and Sokkhak provides the therapists there. The moment I stepped in it felt wonderful. Greeted warmly from both the girls I'd seen at The Aviary. Picked 60 minute chakra head massage. Shoulders neck head. Filled out form. Medium to light pressure. Body outline to draw what was OK for the therapist to touch and avoid. I drew a circle round the head to the shoulders for OK. Circle from shoulders to the feet for avoiding. Its a head, neck and shoulder massage after all... Feet wash. Nice. Jandles to wear. Cup of tea. Cold face cloth. Luxury. Away we went. Up 3 flights of stairs. Cosy clean room. Had a shower. Lay down. Face down. Lower back massage... After many minutes of feeling worried she'd been given wrong information. Upper arms were massaged. Getting closer but not quite head neck or head. Finally told to roll over. Bingo neck, head shoulders ahhh. Just zoning out then a male therapist knocks on the door and barges in. She tells him to go. Then I just can't unwind at all. But it's finished anyway. Asked to have some oil for my legs. She kindly rubbed some in. Don't get me wrong it was a lovely massage if I'd wanted a backmassage. The manager asked me how it was? I explained. She said it was company policy to give a 40 minute back massage with 20 minutes chakra head neck shoulders? So we found my form (in the rubbish bin) and I was then told I should have put crosses = x x x etc where I didn't want to be touched? That's when I went from concerned that the therapist had been given the wrong information to annoyed. It didn't mention \"back\" once in the blurb. Was only charged 50% OK. The owner just happened to arrive as I was paying and he sincerely listened. But I left feeling very mislead. Plus worried the therapist had been offended. It's a lovely place, environment and great massage. But they need to just focus on the areas they describe."

Nice clean environment. Only one with guest filling in a questionnaire (though I guess it's the email address they wanted). Short customary foot bath. Massage room was up in level 3. When I needed a toilet, I had to get down to level 1 again. For his effort, gave a $5 tip. But not sure if I will return.The masseur tried very hard at massaging, was panting at many parts of the treatment but he also yawned at least 7 times (guess he needed food since it was dinner time). Not rhythmic. Many stops in routine. Different massage on both limbs. Equally hard on large & small muscles groups. Guess he needs more practice & feedback."

The wife enjoyed her foot reflex while my male masseur wasn't quite sure on the pressure points and had to either double check or miss completely. My four hands massage was superb while the wife felt hers was just too new and don't really know what to do. I'm supportive of new staff working and gaining experience, but not when it costs 4x more than the row of massage parlours across the street. In summary, mixed feelings."

Lobby of the spa was as warm as weather outdoors even though air con shows 16degrees. We did the usual, filled in forms, area of concerns, preferred pressure, gender of therapists. We booked a 3hr spa avocado package, includes massage, scrub, facial. Before proceeding to the treatment room, sokkhak staff asked whether we mind having a male therapist for facial, my reply was we prefer a female therapist. She asked a second time and I gave the same reply thinking she might not understand what I meant. Then she asked the third time! She claim that the male therapist are also very professional and assure that they will not be able to see our body as we will be Covered with towels. Thats not the point! Why do you ask when you do not take NO as an answer! At this point it became obvious that I had to oblige and agree otherwise we will not be able to proceed to start treatment. During the massage I was perspiring like mad even though I was only covered with a towel, therapist herself? Sweating too! It came a point I couldn't tell whether it's the Lemongrass oil on my body or her sweaty palms on me. Adjusted the air con to no avail. They did \"brushing\" on my body with brush similar to a \"laquer brush\", see absolutely no health benefits to this procedure. As light as feather. We left after the scrub really disappointed. Worse spa experience I had. Despite acceptable service recovery (discounts and apologies), I would not recommend this spa and definitely don't deserve to be #1. my first and last time."

My mum and I were sat down and looked through the extensive offerings in their menu before being given a sheet that allows us to mention our choice of oils from a range (more than 5 I think), pressure, health issues, skin condition, gender of therapist and notify them of problem area we want extra care on and areas we wanted to avoid. As they were short of therapists at that time, my mum was asked if a male therapist was fine. We were offered a foot wash and slight scrub before changing into slippers and entering our separate rooms as we opted this time. I did a back massage + body scrub and mum did a swedish + facial. I selected hard pressure and I certainly got what I asked for as I was quite desperately in need to fix my back before I started back at work. My therapist not only used good pressure, she spent extra effort on my obvious back problem without me having to direct her to and i appreciated it. There was also massage using the elbow I believe in my routine. The avocado scrub was good and shower was prepared at good temperature. I thoroughly enjoyed the session and woke up the next day with a slightly achy back from the hard treatment but already feeling so much better and the least tense I have felt in a while. My mum also shared that her massage was done professionally with good pressure and excellent technique that it also fixed some problem areas she didn't even know existed and that they no longer hurt when she went for massages elsewhere days after.The only \"areas of improvement\" would probably be less casual chatter at the front desk and that my therapist was obviously sick but still working. Also, we were told we needed to wait 10 mins because they were having dinner but I think they needed the time to prepare the fresh ingredients instead. Even with these service quality points, I would not hesitate to come back again just for the hands that know what their client really needs. For the price I paid, Sokkhak Spa is indeed a steal and really, you need not look elsewhere if you're looking for a serious massage."

We mentioned that we e-mailed at 9am, and he responded that they hadn\u2019t checked their e-mail since then. 6 hours later. I understand that this is Cambodia, but if you\u2019re a service business that takes appointment requests on your website, it might be a decent idea to check your e-mail once every few hours.After leaving the spa (and the country), I realized that I left my watch in the massage room. I e-mailed the spa to see if they had found it, and have not received a response in the week since. This is another example of the company\u2019s poor communications and questionable service."

We had our feet washed with warm water and escorted to a elegantly decorated couples room with shower. The massage was very good and showed good techniques. However, they did not try to resolve the knots that they found which was disappointing. On leaving we were given tea and slices of mango. It was the best massage we have had in SE Asia."

It was not only professional and pleasant from start to finish but I came away feeling relaxed and with my skin looking better it has done in years. And more than that, 3 weeks later it is still looking and feeling amazing. I must admit I had reservations about spending two hours of my last day in Siem Reap in a spa but those doubts quickly faded away as I walked into the reception. I mixed and matched the sokkhap spa treatments as I have sensitive skin and Sokkhak was great at not only accommodating my needs but recommending what would be best for me. I have done a number of treatments all over the world in my time and I have never come away feeling this good. All I can say if you are thinking of visiting a spa and want a touch of luxury, you have to go sokkhak. One of the reviews said you would think you were robbing them and I have never read truer words. Thanks Sokkhak spa for a wonderful experience! I will definitely be returning and sending all my friends who visit siem reap your way!"

My one piece of advice is not to put this off to the end of your stay but to visit as many times as you can throughout your holiday.This spa is beautiful. Set in a quiet street next door to the Haven training restaurant as soon as you walk through the outside garden and into the entrance of the spa you immediately enter a different world. Calm, spiritual, modern, stylish, intoxicating with lemongrass all your senses are triggered and they haven't even done anything to you yet. This is a very professional organisation where you are greeted warmly and allowed an informal consultation on the packages the spa has to offer. Whether it be a massage, reflexology, foot or body scrub or one of their specialised packages the choice is entirely yours. The cost is very reasonable compared to similar establishments in Malaysia or Thailand. We chose a two hour Khymer package which consisted of a massage and facial which costs $48 and was worth every dollar. The treatment rooms whether single or for a couple are fantastic. Spacious, relaxed,stylish, impeccably clean, lovely shower room all helps towards a calming ambience. The treatment itself is unbelievable. Throughout your masseur will check to see if you are ok, whether the massage is strong enough while allowing you to drift off into Bolivian. At the end of it you come out feeling like a new person body and soul. Both my wife and I said the same that we wish we had done this earlier and tried other treatments. An amazing experience which we will never forget."

The friendly and warm staff, calm and soothing wood interiors and lush garden surrounding is just what a spa should be. I had a Khmer massage (similar to a Thai massage). After cold tea and a cold towel, they cleaned and scrubbed my feet in a bath of dried flowers and herbs, put some fresh slippers on me and took me to an individual room w a large shower attached. I was so pleased to take a cool shower to wash the dust and sweat off before having my massage. The masseuse was excellent in both technique and her questioning to make sure the pressure was correct, stretching not too intense. This style of massage releases energy centers and thus tension. It stretches you in ways not possible on your own. It is intense and can be painful if the masseuse is not sensitive and attentive. My masseuse was perfect and I left feeling whole again."

From my experience, only professional spas will have this, though take hid that their prices are slightly higher than the average spas in siem reap. If I could nitpick and choose on areas to improve, I would prefer the aroma to be stronger. Also, there was no rubbish bin in the room, and no shower curtain for needed privacy. You could hear the loud music from the neighboring pubs but that did not bother me much. I would return but perhaps to try different treatment and during day time.

She was strong and sensitive and adapt. Three years of experience. And pure delight! And the manicure and pedicure was fun! I chose yellow gold nail polish.

It's hard to walk 10 meters in Siem Reap and not find a massage shop or a spa, but it is somewhat more difficult to find one with well trained masseurs and a high level of customer service. Very often what you'll find is either lackadaisical, chatty, sadistic, middle aged women stretching muscles with inexpertise to the point of being dangerous, or inept teenagers chatting amongst themselves with no idea or care about what they're supposed to be doing. Though Sokkhak is roughly double the price of the average massage shop, but less than some of the very high end places, what you pay for is their expertise and suitable environment in which to drift away. This establishment has a very calm, serene atmosphere, and is very tastefully decorated from the moment you enter the reception, to the point you are led to your room. Huge showers, high quality massage beds, plenty of clean towels, discreet and pleasant staff. I had two massages here on different days. The first was a two hour Swedish massage, which was, I think, the best massage I've ever had. Perfect. The second was a herbal compress massage, which seemed to compliment the somewhat harder nature of the Swedish massage. A good combination. As someone who has massages every week - and lives in Japan where they're twice the price for half the quality - I'd say that Sokkhak represents remarkable value for money in all areas. Highly recommended."

I explained to the Spa manager my situation and she took great care in advising her staff. My wife and I agreed that these were the best massages that we have had in Asia. Many thanks to the skilled and caring staff."

The front of house staff are very friendly and the facility is very clean and premium for Siem Reap. I had the signature Sokkhak Spa Package for $60 USD and the treatment was amazing from the welcome, complimentary cold tea, beautiful foot bath and scrub to the 3 hours of treatments including a full massage, body scrub and moisturize and facial. The masseur was very skilled and the treatment was awesome. Great product and service for the money. I may go again before I leave Siem Reap."

No shower amenities (empty), no tissues in room. Room too cold. No smart uniform from the management team. Felt this just missed the mark as a quality Spa and Massage"

They served us some ice tea and a cold towel then proceeded to wash our feet. Afterwards we headed to our rooms (2 couple rooms and 1 single). From there I knew it was going to be a excellent spa day. The small details made the difference. Towels instead of paper in the bathrooms and the sinks. In room showers (rain down) with a option to shower before (in case you came straight from the temples or just need a shower). A nice bowl of flowers placed under the headrest instead of staring at the floor. The 3hr package was excellent. The masseuse did a excellent job. The body scrub was done so well I probably haven't been this clean in ages! :) After a long hot day seeing the temples this was a great way to end it. It's not those cheap $5 foot massages along the main street. This is comparable to the massages I received at 5* hotels."

I loved it and I am pretty fussy when it comes to spas. I'll admit I read endless reviews of about 5 spas because I get caught in \"what if I don't choose the best one\" - and then after it all, I went past Sokkhak and walked in and just booked there. Thank goodness. So you can stop reading reviews and give this place a try!Note there are spas everywhere - you can have a $10 massage for an hr - or you can have a $50 massage for an hour at a very top spa, or rather go HERE which is in the middle price range but super quality. They look after you beautifully from your arrival, you feel nurtured and pampered. The only suggestion I made to them was turn up the music when the neighbouring restaurant starts washing up (clink clink) but I was so chilled by then it wasn't really a bother. And during the facial when you have the gunk on your face for 10 mins, they should massage the feet! I read other reviews later who said they went back to Sokkhak every day! Ha! I would have if I'd been around any longer. Enjoy."

We have tried many other massage businesses and have found Sokkhak Spa to be an unforgettable experience and one that we enthusiastically highly recommend. Every time we visit we have the most beautiful, peaceful massages regardless of who the therapist is, starting with tea and a wonderful foot scrub using local flowers and ending with tea and the most delicious mango, all beautifully presented. The Spa itself is tastefully decorated, elegant in its simplicity and as \"Sokkhak\" means tranquility in Khmer, the owner Mr Kaan has achieved this in the space with ease. The therapists have all been trained very well in the art of massage with the manager, Miss March passing on her overseas training with them- we always have an hour and a half aromatherapy essential oil massage and it is the only place in the world that I have experienced massage where I am able to sleep during my massage. The spa has many other beautiful products on offer from Tropical Mango Scrubs to Body Wraps using Pumpkin, Avocado and Honey, Vitamin Rich Facials and Lymphatic Massage to name a few, however, we don't get past the oil massage because its SUBLIME! My husbands favourite therapist is Mrs Saret and my favourite is Mrs Nim. Mr Vanna also gives a wonderful massage - again the only place in the world where I have enjoyed a massage given by a man! Congratulations to the team at Sokkhak Spa - we will be back in October for many more massages!Suzanne and Michael Pawley"

Sokkhak Spa was recommended by my hotel (Rambutan Resort) and ended up to be one of the best massage experiences I've had and a highlight of my time in Siem Reap. From the minute you walk in the door you begin to relax. After serving tea and washing your feet, you are taken into a relaxing (meaning simple, inviting and elegant) treatment room: for me that was a 90 minute oil massage by Khemera who is excellent. It was the perfect afternoon activity after a day climbing around the ruins of Angkor. It was so good I immediately booked a second appointment with Khemera later in my stay. I enthusiastically recommend Sokkhak Spa and Khemera specifically."

I was not able to get a massage on the first night I was there as a walk-in, so I booked for the following day. I went with something simple to try it out, the traditional Khmer massage. It was similar to a Thai massage, but gentler and more relaxing. Because it was so good, I booked the 3-hour package the following day, which was only $60. Incredible cost performance. This treatment was a bit extravagant but well worth it, so I booked again for my last night. Unfortunately, there was a rolling blackout on the last day for exactly the duration of the visit, so it was hot, but not unbearably so. I can't recommend enough and will definitely be back again."

Not luxurious by any means but comfortable and stylish.Small touches like the cold towels and ice tea when you arrive makes for a nice welcome. A wide range of treatments available - prices are expensive by local standards but reasonable compared to other countries. Rooms are a reasonable size with en-suite showers. We liked the fact that the place was very clean and well maintained - the towels smelled wonderful!We had a couple of minor issues but the owner, Kann, sorted this out quickly. Overall, it's a professionally managed operation and well worth a visit. We went 3 times over 5 days.During our stay in Siem Reap (low season), all the tourist magazines advertised a 15% discount at the spa so be sure to bring this coupon with you to enjoy the deal. The magazines are also available on-site but the receptionists will not tell you about this or offer you the discount automatically. Strongly recommend."

I wish I could go for a Cambodian hot herbal scrub just now......This place is swankier and classier than any spa I tried in KL (with the exception of the Mandara Spa at the Sheraton Imperial).The staff are extremely friendly and at the same time so very professional. This is no hanky panky spa so be forewarned. When my friend took me there for the first time, he said he had booked me a 2-hour body massage so I complained about the length of time. His answer was try it first and tell me about it once you are done. And man was he right!!! It was the closest I can think of to an elevating experience. When they asked me for my feedback while enjoying the complementary freshly-sliced mango with tea, I responded by saying I felt like a leaf that had fallen from a tree into a stream that carried it away. The repeated strokes on each section of my tired and travel-battered body left me deeply relaxed and refreshed at the same time. I decided to go back two days later to see whether the reason that I felt so good was because the massage came shortly after arrival to town and helped me relax. I ordered the same treatment and yes, it was as good as the first time. That's how I got hooked. And the sweetest part of it all: I didn't pay more than 60 bucks for the two hours! This is how it works: when you arrive (make sure you call first and book because it can get busy), you are offered a warm cup of tea. Then a neat booklet is handed so you can choose the treatment you want and believe me it is a difficult task. There are so many options that range between tempting and too tempting. Once you make a selection, you are given a short foot wash and scrub on the spot followed by a trip to an individual fully private room with its own shower!!! The setting inside the room is pretty basic but functional. I wish they would come up with a better option to hang clothes on than the \"tree branch\" they have which leaves your clothes creased. A good old fashioned hanger would suffice. The masseur or masseuse will ask if you want to take a shower and politely exits the rooms until you change or shower. Then the blissful experience starts. I went for a facial, a mango-based body scrub and luckily for me, I tried the Cambodian hot herb scrub (I think this is what it is called) because I normally like hot stone massages. It is a combination of a Khmer traditional body massage for each part of the body immediately followed by strokes with a very warm bundle of something I did not see because I was too busy enjoying that special experience. No matter what I write or how well I try to do it, it will not come close to describing the actual experience. And yes, I had it every day until I had to fly back to KL. Believe you me, if I had the time, I would book a flight online now just to spend a few days of well-needed, innocent and worthwhile pleasures.I wan to thank March at the reception and her male colleague who were as pleasant as sunshine even when I called and dropped in on short notice."

We walked in without any reservations on two consecutive days and thankfully they were able to accommodate us. We were welcomed with refreshing towels, cold drinks and a nice foot bath before starting on our chosen treatments. The reception area and massage rooms had a nice relaxing ambience. You will be led to upstairs massage rooms with slightly steep stairs and each room had an attached private shower area which was perfect for a quick shower before and after the sessions. Between our two visits, my husband did the anti stress massage, foot reflexology and manicure while I did the herbal compress massage (which was heavenly) and pedicure. There was some mix up for the treatments for my husband and the four massage therapists we encountered had very limited command of English so it would be good to clarify clearly with the receptionist before starting. Nevertheless, my husband who tries hard to avoid massage was full of praises for Sokkhak and he loved the manicure as well. Personally I find the pedicure average but given the price, it was good. The massage treatments were also reasonably priced and we find it absolutely value for money. The therapists were well trained, polite and professional. There was minimal chit chatting between them during our sessions and if there is, they would be whispering. We enjoyed the sessions tremendously and it was truly a wonderful and relaxing experience for us. We ended our visit with mango and hot tea served by the spa. I would certainly remember my visit to Siem Reap with fondness largely due to Sokkhak Spa."

Therapists are well trained and professional so you can be assured of a great treatment, whatever you opt for. A bit on the pricey side, but the last time I was there, they did give me a generous discount (probably because it was low season and business was quiet). If I'm not mistaken, the owner of Sokkhak Spa was involved and instrumental in the set-up of the earlier established Bodia Spa (and he is also the owner of the elegant Chanrey Tree restaurant). By comparison, treatments I have had at Sokkhak have so far been better than the ones I've had at Bodia Spa - but that's my personal preference."

The aromatherapy oil massage is my favourite, and the herbal compress massage is great too if you're particularly achey. The design and decoration of the spa is great, you feel relaxed as soon as you walk in, and the whole experience is great, including the foot bath at the start and welcome cup of tea, as well as tea and fruit after your massage. This is truly one of the nicest spas I've been to.You can take a shower before or after the massage as well, which is great if you've been out all day, and also if you want to wash off the oil after the massage. The staff at the front desk speak very good English, so if you have any particular areas you want to focus on, speak to them before your massage, as the massage therapists all speak some basic English, but not all of them speak a lot of English. I've also had a body treatment and facial here, which were good, but the massages are really standout."

Once again staff were lovely though, and pre and post treatment excellent.Treatment rooms up step stairs, don't know if there are ground floor rooms. If not would not be suitable for elderly."

I took the 180 minutes package which includes a massage, a body scrub and facial.Started with a flowery foot bath and was led to the upstairs treatment room to start the massage. The therapist working on me was professional, checking with me the degree of pressure been exerted. Overall was value worth for the price paid (US$58). Of course cannot be compared to the budget prices of the massage places along Pub Street area as you pay a premium for the privacy and luxurious surroundings of Sokkha.Was pleasantly surprised to find out when dining at Chan Rey Tree that this two outlets are affiliated. Would return to both the restaurant as well as this spa the next time I visit SR."

We found Sokkhak Spa next door to the Haven Restaurant and we were not disappointed. I had foot Reflexology and a Vitamin facial. The facial was excellent and whilst the reflexology was not as good as I have had it was certainly very good. I also had a manicure which was very good it was in a room upstairs - need to be careful of the stairs as they are a bit steep. This is not your on the street spa but it is still certainly far cheaper than having this at home. The staff do not speak a lot of English so you need to be quite clear once you are in your room so they understand how hard or soft you would like your treatment. Pity I left this until the last day as had I had time I would have a massage."

Therapist was ok, had trouble with English and pressure was inconsistent. I get massages frequently and she seemed a bit tentative and inexperienced. No water at the end for my shower but it eventually came back. There was tea and mango along with a survey form to be filled out which was ok I guess. But I did not put down my email and was firmly asked to supply it. Why I gave them a valid one escapes me. I was also asked to post a review on TripAdvisor which bothered me (although this seems to be a trend I am noticing).

I suppose you could say it's overhyped but keep in mind that the price is only half of that in the fancy hotels, and the service is definitely wonderful and the ambience quite nice. My wife an I had the four-hand massage and we are definitely hooked. $55 for 90 minutes for each of us - and TO DIE FOR!!!

So I was excited to try it and hoped it wasn't just a rub down named differently like so many other places here who charge these sorts of prices. Take it from me, as someone with a badly damaged leg and scarring I have been back every day, sometime twice due to the professional and delightful staff who are skilled, considerate and caring. Even going so far as to braid my hair for me after a 90 minute massage. Remembering you are still in Asia, and you can't compare to sports massage therapists at home, this is the best place I have been in Cambodia and I visit every year. You have your feet washed and you are given the option for a shower in case you're feeling dusty. You can discuss your preferred strength or focus areas for attention and get to enjoy a little mango and tea afterwards. "

The spa was nicely decorated with a cozy ambience, front desk officers are polite. My husband and I took the Avocado face and body package that comprises of a facial, body scrub and massage in a couple room, a male therapist was assigned to my husband while a female therapist was assign to me. We were offered to have a shower to relax our mind and body before the treatment starts, however I was quite disturbed when the therapist knocked our door while I was still showering, they barge in despite I told them to wait outside. At least I think the female therapist should ensure the female guest is well covered before the male therapist step in. We started the treatment with a body scrub and were informed by the therapist to shower. I requested for a new disposable underwear for us to change after the body scrub, but despite asking for a numbers of time, the therapist did not offer us a new one but keep asking us to use back the underwear. The therapist understanding of English is low and do not understand what I trying to say, so end up I just gave up and let her assert the pressure she want. During the massage treatment, the therapist were giggling to each other at couple of times and that was very disturbing for us to sleep. We fell asleep during the facial treatment and the therapists did not acknowledge me even though we are awake. Both of them were chit chatting at the corner of room. Lastly, I was disgusted to find a few baby cockroaches on the treatment room basin. Overall the treatment is fine but not fantastic whilst there are still plenty room for improvement in regards to service and hygiene."

            "review": "Khmer massage and foot rub. My friends and I were halfway through our trip of Southeast Asia and felt it was time for a relaxing spa treatment. I had originally found out about Sokkhak right here on TA. I had originally thought it was be a tuk tuk right from our hotel, but what do you know it was on the same street and only a few steps down the street from the hotel.We didn't make an appointment, so when we walked in there were only two masseuses available at the time, and we were a party of three. However there would be another available in 45mins time, so no problem, went back to hotel for a bit then came back. Upon browsing through their menu I didn't really find something I wanted, which was a Khmer massage (I just wanted to see what this was like) and a foot massage. They had a package that was similiar but not exactly what I wanted, so I had asked if I could get 1.5 hrs of Khmer massage and 30mins of foot massage for a total of two hours. They had no problems accommodating my request.We had a our feet washed first. Then to the massage rooms. We each had our own room. There are showers in the rooms, so you can shower before your massage if you like, which I did. You get some capri pants and shirt to wear for the massage. I felt too hot for the shirt so went without it. I would have went without the pants too, but out of respect for the masseuse I had those on, as I wasn't sure to expect out of the massage.Massage was great! I enjoyed it. I would say the Khmer massage employs a lot of stretching of the muscles, and more kneading of the muscles and not necessarily isolating each muscle like you would in a Swedish massage. I wish I could have spent 6 hours there, but it was evening and my friends and I were getting hungry.This is a legit massage/spa (which is what we wanted), so no special boom boom afterwards (which we weren't looking for).My friends had mentioned afterwards about the loud music/noise from the adjacent building/restaurant/pub, as their rooms were on the first/main floor. I was the upper/second floor and didn't hear a thing. This place won't be as cheap as those $1 massage joints or $5 massage places with special extras afterwards, but you get a nice atmosphere and quality service.We each spent about USD$50 for the services plus tip to the masseuses.We got some mango slices at the end of the service and some tea.I'd recommend this place to relax and unwind and treat yourself while in Siem Reap. Not cheap like you can get everywhere else ($1-5), but cheaper than what I can get here in Canada, where I pay CDN$100 for one hour."

So you get great value for money and an experience to remember, especially for tired muscles.The location is convenient, amenities impressive and service very professional. The therapists are well trained and very attentive. Teka is one of the best!There's good reason they rank highest as a spa service in Cambodia... the rest are average because the Khmer aren't inclined towards 'giving' massages... it's a Balinese or Thai thing"

The gentleman on the front desk spoke perfect English and was very polite and helpful. Later that day I had my appointment with Ms Lay. Lasting roughly 3 hours, the package was well worth the money paid. The rooms are beautifully decorated with little shower rooms attached. Ms Lay made me feel very comfortable and was extremely professional. The Swedish massage I had was one of the best I've ever had!The scrub and lotion products used were top quality. I left feeling very happy with the experience. Upon leaving, you are offered mango and tea which I thought was a lovely gesture. It's true that there are endless massage services available in Siem Reap, but what Sokkhak provide is truly a cut above the rest. My only criticism (and it's a tiny one!) would be that the music played into the room is on constant repeat - meaning that if you have a longer treatment like the one that I had, it can be a little jarring to hear the same pieces over and over but it's no big deal really.Recommended."

We originally booked for 1 1/2 hrs aromatherapy massage at 9 pm. The spa phoned us to arrive at 8:45 such that they could give us the full 1 1/2 hrs treatment. We arrived there on time. The first impression is great. They washed our feet with jasmine flowers in the water. They led us to the treatment rooms (2 couple rooms and 1 single room) so far so good. We all indicated we need strong massage. After the treatment, we shared our experience. Out of the 5 therapists, 2 are average. The other 3 therapists are just terrible. They first applied some pressure because we asked for strong massage. But, gradually, the stokes became very gentle, just like using their hands to brush my body. My therapist went out 3 times, each lasts for about 5 minutes. One time was to excuse for toilet, one time which I understand is for washing hands after massaging the feet, one time I didn't understand why. In addition to these 3 breaks, there are many times that they didn't do anything on my body. When I lied on the bed facing up with my eyes covered with small towel, I had to remove my towel searching for the therapist because she didn't do anything. After searching for a while, I found her just standing at the back of the room and didn't do anything. I thought I am the only one that is so unlucky to have this therapist, but found out my 2 other friends had the same problem with their therapists that didn't do anything for a few times. We wanted to complain, but the therapists were waiting at the exit waiting for tips and ready to close the door because we are their last customers for the day. We stayed at Siem reap for 5 days and had 6 massages. This is the worst massage that I ever experienced. We were very lucky that we had the best massage in other spa the day we left for home. We truly don't understand why sokkhak spa deserved so many good reviews."

My wife tried a couple of spas before Sokkhak and was really impressed with their professionalism and the treatment she received - a 2hr package of head and body massage . She went back again the next day for a different treatment - reflexology and aromatherapy massage - and was equally satisfied. They seem to often have 15% and 30% discount promotions running but you need to find the coupons in one of the many advertising sheets circulated in Siem Reap and bring the coupon with you to the spa in order to qualify."

Both were exceptional! It's a testament to the spa that it was recommended to me by a marketing head at one of Siem Reap's 5 star luxury hotels. I am withholding the name, purely as they have their own highly acclaimed spa. That recommendation says it all. The masseurs were friendly, professional and with the calmest of composures, Then affect was to immediately relax me. The ambience was exactly as it should be for a spa and the experience even better. You will not be disappointed. Add to it all the incredibly reasonable prices.. worth every cent. Congratulations to the owner and his team at Sokkhak!"

Their staff kindly explained the different services offered on the menu and recommended the one best suited for me. I ended up going for the Sokkhak Spa Treatment. For $60, I was pampered for three hours. It was an indulgent experience: massage, body scrub and facial. Because of my stress levels, they permitted me to have the ultimate back massage instead of an aromatherapy massage. Their customer service was simply marvelous because they asked you what you wanted and needed. My therapist was very attentive regarding showers, massage pressure, comfort, etc. The rain shower heads in the bathroom was lovely.... Other spas do not have a nice bathroom to tidy up in! Although, the hot water was a bit spotty. If you are in dire need of freshening up and personalized attention, visit this spa. They accept cash and visa! "

I was taken to a single treatment room in the backyard, (just as lovely as the front!) and could take a shower before the treatment. The lady who did my massage and facial was extremely professional and spoke good English. I felt well taken care of at all times, and the treatment was nothing but divine!Really enjoyed the facial - all the products she applied felt really pure and natural, almost like yogurts and cucumber (think it was). Simply the best spa experience I ever had, and great value for money! It might be a bit pricey for a backpacker budget, but it's worth every penny. They made me feel like a million dollars:)"

The services and facilities were so nice, I went two days in a row!There was some miscommunication when I got there - my hotel had called to make an appointment, but it wasn't on the books. The woman at reception seemed a bit annoyed by this, but she was actually quite nice afterwards and on my second visit, was genuinely concerned about my eyes, which were red and irritated from the strong sun and being in the hot, dusty temples all day.First visit: Sokkhak Spa Retreat package (180 mins for $60 USD). Starts with a relaxing foot bath. I was even able to take a quick shower to rinse off beforehand. Amazing 75 minute massage, followed by body brushing, and a yummy mango body scrub and facial. They both smelled so good! I wanted to eat what they were putting on my face. That was followed by an application of body lotion. My face and body were so soft! It was a shame I had to go out into the heat and dust afterwards.Second visit: Khmer Getaway Package (120 mins, $48 USD). Starts out with the Khmer massage, which is much different than a Swedish one. It's pretty close to a deep tissue massage, with some stretching added in. Good thing I'm pretty flexible, because the masseuse was pretty aggressive (in a good way). I'm not sure it's that relaxing during, but it definitely gets the kinks out. I will admit I couldn't fully enjoy it because of my eye issues. I can't even remember what my second treatment was. I think it was some sort of body wrap because they recommended not getting a facial two days in a row (should be 1x a week).I heard two ladies walk in and ask how much a massage was and walked way after saying it was too expensive. Yes, this isn't a $10 massage, but I doubt you'll find this level of service, cleanliness and ambiance there! There was another woman who was there two days in a row as well, which says a lot!"

I've been living in Siem Reap for a year now, and of all the spas I've tried (many, as I'm kind of a massage junkie), this is -- hands down -- the best massage town. My assistant has been here for two years and she says the same. I really can't say enough about this place. I go nearly every week and recommend it to all of my friends. This is a relatively new spa, so I'm only concerned that once people find out how amazing it is, it'll get completely booked out. I utterly disagree that Bodia is better (Bodia feels like a posh factory and the masseuses are hit or miss). At Sokkhak you get your own beautiful room with a shower, so you're never disturbed by other clients coming and going. The welcome tea, foot bath, and fruit afterwards are divine. However, what really makes Sokkak a haven of individual attention is the incredibly kind staff and masseueses who are willing to adjust to any special requests (eg focus on back/shoulders or specific aches/pains). There are a number of spas in town where they have a nice massage routine, but at Sokkhak the masseuses seem to \"read\" your body in order to provide the most healing, relaxing experience."

Having seen rave reviews about the massages by Sokkhak Spa, we decided to drop in for a manicure/pedicure session since we weren't in the mood for massage. First off, I liked how they cleaned our feet with a foot bath filled with lime and flowers. The therapist also used the lime slices to gently rub on our nail beds. We were led to the second floor and shown to reclining beds. When my therapist sat down in front of me, she started preparing the towels and to my horror, she used the towel she placed on her lap to clean the inside of her nose. She continued using that towel and asked me to place my feet on that same towel. It was a while later before she changed to another towel. Granted I should have asked her to change it immediately but I was in shock. When cleaning the cuticles, she cut me in the flesh and it bled. I knew my therapist was an inexperienced one since the one serving my friend kept turning to look at her to check if everything was fine. At the end of the session, the nail polish were all over my cuticles and I tried to let her know that these should be cleaned. I gave up and went to another shop to remove the polish. My friend also chose to remove hers as there were bald spots and bumps on our polishes. I believe their massages must be good since there are so many good reviews but it's a shame about the manicure/pedicure service. I'm giving it 2 stars instead of 1 star because they are so nice and I really hope they can train their therapists more before letting them perform nail services."

From the moment you step inside, your whole body relaxes. The modern minimalist style, and the owner's dedication to natural products is impressive. The body scrub and facial were amazing. My masseuse was not really a \"natural\" and her touch was not deep enough. I think the quality varies. I was told if I was not happy with the masseuse after 10 minutes I could request someone else. It is my fault that I did not. When I go again(and I definitely will) next year I will make sure to ask for someone with more experience. Highly recommended!"

No comparison possible with any other place in South East Asia. The first time I was in a real spa where the therapist (m/f) is not asking you if you want a happy ending!!! It's a first class spa with very talented and professional staff. It's gay friendly BUT remains fully professional therapy. Highly recommended! Try the 3-hour package and you'll feel as young as a newborn. And all this for a very affordable price."

The decor is minimalist chic. On arrival you are treated to a cold scented towel to wipe away the dust and heat of the temples. I got a foot bath in a bowl filled with flower petals while I sipped iced tea. Once my feet were clean and my slippers were on, my therapist led me through a serene courtyard and into my treatment room. There I was able to shower before my luxurious and relaxing massage. The massage was delightful. Afterwards I felt refreshed and rejuvenated. Once I was dressed again, my therapist led me back to reception where I was greeted with another cool towel, more iced tea, and fresh slices of watermelon. It was the perfect ending to a glorious spa experience. Sokkhak spa is a hidden gem in Siem Reap."

The building is so well designed for its purpose The staff are very professional and well-trained. I have had several different types of massage from several of the masseurs, and, without exception, I have been able to check all the 'excellent' boxes on the feedback form. From the welcome drink and having one's feet washed, through the massage and the farewell tea and fruit, everything is done well at Sokkhak. A truly wonderful experience."

It was a decent massage (I must admit I don't get massages often so I don't know the nuances of massages), but the body tonic message at Bodia was similar but overall hands down better. Despite being female they ran out of female masseuses so I had a male masseuse which was a bit weird.

We took a 3 hour spa package each - I tried the avacado one while my husband tried the traditional Khmer package. It was simply superb! - the staff have been well-trained and treat your body with care. The ambience of the spa is really nice too - it instantly puts you at ease and relaxes you. I'd definitely recommend this, specially if you are bone-tired after visiting the innumerable temples around Siem Reap and are looking for a safe and pleasant spa-experience."

Rarely do I find a massage that deserves a top score - and almost never do I take the time to sit and review. This time it's a pleasure. From a warm ambiance, great attention to detail, cleanliness and an excellently-trained staff - to a wonderful experience with recommended natural treatments for individual problems recommended by owner, Kann Soann.One of the newest and individually designed spas, it has everything expected of larger, often more expensive rivals - Sokkhak has an edge that's difficult to fault. Reviewed recently in the Friday edition of the Phnom Penh Post that summed Sokkhak up in the lines \"the word ... comes from the Sanskrit for 'harmony' or 'happiness' and this is the experience Kann is striving to create.\""

It was recommended by another couple who had raved about their experience. My partner and I booked for 60 minute massages, we were greeted in a professional manner in the beautifully decorated foyer. Our treatment started with a foot soak and herbal tea. We were taken to treatment rooms that were equipped with showers and peaceful surroundings.After an amazing treatment, that felt longer than an hour, we were given more tea and a platter of fruit.I can't recommend Sokkhak Spa more highly. It was a beautiful experience that 10 of the other people on my tour also loved!! We wished we'd found it a day earlier to give ourselves time to go back again!"

As we walked passed the beautiful front garden, we were greeted by the friendly staff. They started soaking my feet with warm water mixed with lemongrass and fresh lime and some kind of herbs which was so aromatic. During the 90 minutes long massage, my masseur skillfully worked on my torso, legs, and arms while changing the aroma after each set. It was so relaxing afterward I felt like I was walking on cloud. To finish it off after the massage, they treated us with chilled fresh fruits and ginger tea. Beside the skills and the services, I also love the design of the place, which you can tell the owner has put in a lot of effort to bring the customers the whole experience. I liked this place so much I grabbed a stack of their cards to give to my friends back home in case they travel to Siem Reap in the future :)"

I am on a month long trip through Thailand and Cambodia with my 3 kids (adults) and they decided it was time for me to take a break from the hustle bustle of busy days. Today it was such a wonderful surprise when they told me that they were sending me to Sokkhak Spa for 3 hours of pampering....and that's just what it was from the moment I stepped in their door. The entrance walkway is on stepping stones surrounded by water and tropical plants, very unique. The reception area is very modern and open...you feel relaxed just being there. My 3 hour body massage, body scrubbing and facial was fantastic. I feel so rejuvenated! Thanks to my wonderful kids, Michelle, Nancy and Mike :-)"

Our first day in Siem Reap ended with an amazing 4 hands massage for me and an herbal compress massage for my husband at Sokkhak Spa, which we discovered after having lunch in Haven restaurant right beside it. The spa was very beautifully and tastefully decorated. The treatments were calming, relaxing and carefully done. I especially appreciate how the therapists respect privacy, modestly covering body parts and keeping very silent during the entire process. Kaan, the owner, was especially charming and helpful. He even recommended a few great places to eat in. We definitely recommend this spa!!!"

Every detail is meticulously taken care of. The service staffs are very polite and spa therapists are very qualified. According to the owner I spoke to , they constantly gone through many trainings. The welcome tea is something I have not tasted in any other spa before. It has a unique blend of taste and I really like it. The spa therapist will first clean your feet and will assist you to a private room with an attached bathroom. I had the aromatherapy oil massage. I would recommend you to take 90 mins instead of 60 mins as the whole experience was really pampering especially after a long day of walking in the temples."

The staff, therapist, treatments and Kaan (the owner) are all very friendly. The exterior and interior are contemporary designed. Inside is tranquil and relaxing. In my short stay, I had to visit it the second time. The 3hr treatment of massage, body brush, body scrub, facial is simply divine. The other treatment of Khmer massage is the best too. Will surely recommend to eceryone. Sokkhak Spa -thank you for the great & memorable experience."

We were going to go for e body wraps but the owner told us with this weather it would be better to go for the scrubs. We were given a cold herbal tea and had our feet washed by the staff. This is the first time that I felt a spa was so professional. The girls were trained so well and extremely polite, even when we were having out scrub we couldn't hear anything but the music, I'm definitely going back before the end of our trip. Other palaces may be cheaper but this place is definitely worth it. After a long day walking around Siem Reap this is a place to go to un wide and relax, especially your sore feet."

I looked on the Internet and found so many places, but this one stood out from the rest because of its simple but effective website, so I checked it out on trip advisor. All the reviews seemed great so it was worth a visit. Thank goodness I did! I chose the Sokkhak Spa Retreat which is a 3 hour combination of an aromatherapy massage, body brushing, body scrub and facial. I had the most relaxing and wonderful experience from the moment I stepped over the cobble stones and through the front door. The whole place is beautiful and very careful attention is given to ensure you have the best possible experience and as a result, the therapy rooms are really lovely. I am staying in Siem Reap for a further 3 months and I've already contemplated booking another treatment for this week! Great place, skilled staff and very good value. I can't sing its praises highly enough!"

The staff is very nice and good English speaking. I tried the Khmer Body Massage and I have to say it was the best massage I've ever had! The woman who gave the massage was an excellent therapist. It was very good for my back (no pain anymore afterwards).One of the best places to enjoy a perfect massage!"

But most importantly for me, the therapists were extremely well trained with excellent hands. I had a back and neck massage as I had some pre-existing back problems - the therapist was great, I felt wonderful afterwards. My friend had an aromatherapy oil massage which he described as \"the best massage of my life\" - quite high praise given he has had massages all over the world. I'd strongly recommend treating yourself to a Sokkhak Spa massage after a hard day walking/hiking (and bicycling in our case) around the temples. I'll definitely be back to Sokkhak Spa when next in Siem Reap - for me its vitally important that massage therapists are well trained and know exactly what they are doing (quite often not the case in Asia) - Sokkhak impressed me."
