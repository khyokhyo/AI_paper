The gardens contain a lot of local fruit, herbs and spices, so it was good to see them all growing together to get an appreciation of what the plants looked like. At the end of the tour you are given a taster of various teas and coffees, free. There was no pressure to buy anything at any stage. However, my husband is a keen coffee drinker and was keen to try to luwak coffee, so bought a cup. He was very impressed, I had a quick taste and it was a well rounded taste - however even here buying direct it was expensive. Definitely worth the trip. We saw the 3 civets in the cage, but my understanding was they were just there to show you what a civet looked like, and more were wandering around - although I might be wrong?They didn't seem stressed in any event."

This was one of his recommendations. The 2nd time was on our river rafting excursion and that was a little more formal. Our first visit wasn't really much of a tour since we didn't sign up for one. But our driver basically set us up to see how the coffee was made and then to a taste testing session.*warning* this may be obvious, but they give you about 16 different cups of coffee/tea...just take sips! We actually finished all 16 because they were SO good, but on the drive home had a bit of a stomach ache lol. They also let us try this apple type tobacco which was pretty good too, but it is very strong and unfiltered so be aware of that.As far as all the teas and coffees, I mean we ended up buying 10 boxes to go so that goes to show that they were VERY tasty and the lady sold us on how each benefits you health wise (whether it be true or not). And yes, we did try the Luwak coffee (cat poo coffee) and it wasn't really that bad. Just the idea probably will turn people away. But we did it to just say we tried it. There are other plantations around Bali so I'm not sure if there is a difference or not but I would recommend taking an hour to drop by one and trying all their flavors!"

The place has a very generous business model in which you can try the teas and coffees for free and choose if you want to buy. Unfortunately this is all spoiled by the presence of caged civets. These are the animals used to produce the Luwak (cat-poo) coffee. The cruelty issues associated with keeping these predominately solitary, nocturnal animals in battery cage conditions is well documented. The demand for the gimmicky coffee only encourages the continuation of these horrible practices. If I had done my research before I would have stayed away. If you do choose to visit, by all means enjoy the teas and coffees but please say no to a cup of Luwak."

For those who wanna see the process of making Luwak coffee and this day sleeping animal - Luwak ( Only active and hunt for their food at night ) This is the right place to go. Although I didn't find the Luwak coffee to be as good as what I was expected but they do offer other selection of unique coffee variant to try on for free. Plus a beautiful padi field view, I believe this place can offer a moment of stamina restore after a tired adventures from other tourist spot."

I got a tour of the forest where they grow many different types of beans and plants. I even got to roast some coffee beans over the fire. The smell and feel of the warm beans was magnificent. After the tour, I got samples of delicious and natural teas and coffees. I chose to purchase a cup of the lewak coffee--which was delicious. Naturally, I bought some coffee and the best dark chocolate to bring back to NYC. Such a great experience!"

A guide shows you how the Luwak coffee is traditionally produced by demonstrating the shelling, grinding and filtering process, and you get to meet a couple of Luwaks although as they're nocturnal I don't think they appreciated being woken up by a poke in the backside on a rainy afternoon. From here you're taken to a tasting area where a selection of teas and coffees are offered to you to try,as is a cup of Luwak coffee but this isn't free but is is IDR 50,000. From there you go on to the shop where several products are offered to you including the very highly price Luwak coffee that personally I don't think is worth the price for its taste, but the cost isn't unreasonable as its entire production is done by hand and is very intensive. This is only a short visit but was a very interesting and worthwhile one."

Once we had samples we went to the shop where we were followed around by the server (clearly commissioned based) and didn't look that happy when I didn't want to buy anything but pay for the coffee we had. If I could give it 3.5 rating I would, it wasn't average but it wasn't very good either."

Before going there though my partner and I didn't really want to, it was a long drive and neither of us really drink coffee.When we got there we had a tour and then a free tasting of all the coffee and tea they had. There was about 10 and they were all amazing. We couldn't believe how fantastic it was. Coconut coffee was our favorite whilst mangosteen and ginger were among the best. We didn't have any money on us while we were there, we were devastated because we couldn't buy anything, but our amazing driver told us he would buy it for us and we could pay him back when we got to our hotel, so we took him up on the offer. Unfortunately my partner lost the coffee on our last day in Bali at the beachwalk shopping centre, for some reason she took it with her and it was never to be enjoyed or seen again.I'm still mad at her to this day for it, its half of the reason why we are going back to Bali in September, can't wait to go back!I recommended the plantation to a friend at work and he loved it as much as we did. The coconut coffee was his favorite also."

There I could see how coffee, cocoa, tangerine trees really look like, also I could see the animal that \"makes\" coffee (Luwak), pineapple plant, cinnamon tree, vanilla plant and so many other exciting plants. They offer free tasting drinks(I recommend the herbal tea and lemongrass tea), and for 50k Rp you could have a taste of the Luwak coffee(it is very strong coffee). Also they have a shop where you could buy coffee and tea souvenirs and a bunch of other great stuff.The staff is very friendly and polite and very good English speakers, explaining you all of the processes for making coffee and growing the other plants. There is no entrance/visitation fee."

You pull into the parking lot and immediately begin walking down a path with a variety of coffee plants. Our driver pointed out the different varieties but there are guides available who work here. You walk past a couple of the cats that make the famous Luwak coffee. Then you will see a demonstration of how the coffee beans from plant to coffee. Afterwards, a guide will escort you to the tasting table where you will be given a sample of 12 items - 4 coffee, 4 teas and 4 hot chocolates. You will be given the option of tasting the Luwak coffee for 5 dollars....we shared 1cup. It tasted slightly less bitter than regular coffee. Then, you have the opportunity to go shopping at their building where you can purchase all the items you tasted plus a variety of spices. Note these items are expensive but we has a lot of fun & love buying things like this as souvenirs. I definitely picked up some saffron that I thought was a bargain at 6 dollars for 1/2 oz consisting the cost in the States.....and 1/2 an oz goes a long way. All in all this was a worthwhile visit that I would do again."

Our driver suggested that we come to the coffee plantation during our day trip and as neither of us like coffee we thought it would be a bit of a waste of time. However I was so wrong! It turned out to be one of the highlights of the trips! Our guide spoke fantastic English and she pointed out the coffee beans on the plants, the pineapple plants, aloe Vera, lemon grass etc growing out in the fields. We were showed the coffee beans in their natural form and then when they were roasted. I even tried my hand at roasting the beans and pounding them into ground coffee. We tried 15 teas and coffees and all were nice and some were amazing. The coffee does not taste like the usual coffee served back home so we loved it. There is a huge shop where you can buy the tea and coffee as well as some lovely gifts. Yes the shop is a little expensive but you don't pay for the tour and it was very educational. If you like food and learning how it grows and is processed by hand then this is the tour for you."

He talked us through the whole range of different fruits and plants, breaking off leaves so that we could smell them. We saw other guides just walking straight garden to the coffee and tea area. The tasting is free although here's an obvious expectation that you buy something which we were fine with considering the time and way we'd been looked after as well as the wonderful slection of free teas and coffees. Love place overall and a welcome stop on the tour. Not too sure about how well the animals are looked after as there were three of the civets in small cages which we didn't care for. I'd like to think they let them out to forage for the coffee but either way it's not something I can condone."

I don't really like hot drinks but tried a few and must say that their vanilla coffee is divine! My partner tried all of the samples and paid a little to have a cup of the luwak coffee which he said tastes rather fruity.

These little animals are caged for a month and then set free. We tried a selection of coffees and teas and I really recommend the coconut coffee which is delicious.

The employees were able to describe the processing of the products in detail,insisting on the bio qulaity. I ended bought a few souvenirs, including two tiny bottles of essential oils. Two months later after arriving back in Europe I checked the recipients .  The top of the recipients is sealed by a rubber/plastic foil which has a powerful chemical smell. So much so that it almost neutralizes the scent of the content.  The consistency is as fluid as water.I threw everything out and decided to not to gift any souvenirs."

A short walk down their path, surrounded by coffee and cocoa, leads to a woman heating and grinding coffee beans.. they explain whats going on, the stages, then move onto the tasting table a few minutes walk away... they prepared 12 different drinks.. about 8 coffees, 1 hot chocolate and a few teas and we tried them - some interesting combo's.. then we went to their shop.. Given that it was all free, I was happy to buy a small bottle of their massage oil. Whilst it was slightly overpriced, the fact that the rest of it was free, and the girl explaining things was a genuine girl trying hard (and clearly from a poor background), I was happy to do so (and tip her).. Personally enjoyed this short visit"

There is no official tour (our driver came with us), and the visit itself is free. At the end, you are rewarded with an array of 20 different coffees and teas to taste, which will blow your tastebuds away.Of course, there is probably an expectation that you will buy some of the coffees/teas in the shop, though we found these to be great gifts for people back home (much higher prices than average in Bali - but it is for tourists, no?). Make a stop here. Really something fun and natural to enjoy."

The walk through the garden was pleasant with each local fruit tree represented. If you have not seen durian, cocoa, coffee, soursop, jackfruit, mangosteen, you can see it here all in one place. The coffee part was disappointing. They set up a demo station to show how coffee bean was roasted by pan frying and then pounded and sieve to get the fine granules. After which you proceed to coffee tasting (this was complimentary unless you want to taste the Luwak Coffee at IDR 50,000. All the samplers have honey and was very sweet so hard to tell their true flavor. They do have tobacco grass you can roll up to smoke (n/c) - great if you are a smoker! After sampling they direct you to the gift shop where the products are sold. No pushy sale here (thank goodness) but everything higher price Han shops/supermarket in Ubud. We bought some gift items as felt bad for the girl who was assigned to be our guide for the tour and tasting as believe if you don't buy she does not earn commission. We paid with CapOne visa and they were going to charge us 3% credit card charge and we told them our visa company does not charge the 3%. They did take it off - so be aware here. Pleasant visit but no true coffee plantation tour."

We also saw coffee beans being hand roasted. After the tour, guests are invited to taste a selection of 7 hot beverages, and another 6 on request, all for free. Think Bali coffee, vanilla coffee, sweet potato coffee and spiced hot chocolate. Guests ate also invited to try Luwak coffee - a bean eaten by a cat like animal, digested and then extracted from the animals waste - hence cat poo cino!

You're not obliged to buy anything afterwards, but it's hard not to as their different teas and coffee are really good. There was a girl there telling us some stuff about the process and the products which I found quite interesting.

Since I used to be a coffee addict, now a tea lover.. this place was really fit to me. when I walked through the pathway leaded by the local guide, my mood turns into better seeing different kind of plants, trees and spices particular for main coffee ingredients. then, our guide lead us to the processing area and showed us the demo. after showing us everything including animals, there was a free testing of coffee with different kind of flavors like Luwak, Gensing, Cocoa, Vanilla and etc. They have a shop for their products if you want to buy coffee, tea, spices and other souvenirs. We had a great time in this place. Also, there is an orange plantation on the other side of the road."

First you visit their civet zoo where these little guys help produce their Luwak \"poo\" coffee. They digest the outer husk of the bean and excrete it. Then workers wash the leavings, winnow the inner husk away, hand roast it over a wood fire, pound it into fine granules using a large wooden mortar and pestle, then sift it and re-pound it. Then they bring you attractively presented complimentary tastings of regular coffee, vanilla coffee, cocoa coffee, cocoa, lemon tea, ginseng tea, and more. A taste of the Luwak coffee costs about $3-not my favorite coffee. They grow all the herbal teas and cocoa on the plantation. Their tasting area overlooks a lovely, breezy rice terrace and pool. Definitely worth a visit."

We saw the Luwaks which were really cute, it was a shame to see them in such a tiny cage which is why I gave this an average rating.We stopped for tea and coffee sampling which was nice, good selection of 10 or so samples.If you are expecting good, strong coffee like back home then I would recommend against this place as most of the testers are tea and you only get a couple of small cups of weak coffee to try.The whole idea of this place is to sell merchandise which is very over priced. We felt a bit obligated to purchase something. We grabbed a bodyscrub which we could have gotten in town at half the price.Overall good but not what we expected."

The staff is friendly and it's beautiful scenery.The only reason I did not give 5 stars is because the luwaks were kept in very small cages and put on display. They are nocturnal animals so should be sleeping during the day. I did not like seeing their natural way of life disturbed, and, although I understand they are important in the process for the Luwak coffee and am not against that, I wish I could have at least seen them in a nicer more natural environment."

We were pleasantly surprised at how interesting and educational the tour was. We had our own guide and she showed us through the gardens, past the animals and the coffee-making process. After that we sat down and had a chance to sample the different coffee and tea varieties. Finally we went to the gift shop where we could purchase, coffee, tea, souvenirs or a range of other things. There wasn't any pressure to buy."

We were shown the processing methods and then we were shown to a table where we were give glasses of approx 15 different types of coffee and tea (for free). I thought this was brilliant and all it them were really tasty. The views from the seating area were fantastic. We were offered to try a cup of the Luwak coffee for 50k (this is very expensive for a coffee but it's not every day you get to try something like that). Then we were taken to the gift shop which we seed a bit pricey but had all the coffee previously tried as well as various spices produced at the plantation. Overall I would definitely advise people to visit here, especially coffee lovers."

Not a coffee drinker myself and thinking I just wanted to get to Ubud we stopped anyway as I'm in Bali so why not and my wife loves coffee and tea? Oh. My. God! This coffee and tea was very good. They make it all there but what is different is that it's all powder. They make the coffee into powder and add spices and other flavors. Most have 3-4 ingredients and you can get them without sugar added or honey added. You try about 15 different coffee and teas and pretty much all taste great! Enjoy the setting, enjoy the coffee and support and local business. The teas are also amazing. Powder as well but strong. Not like tea bags in the USA. They also have lewuk coffee which is ok. Weird drinking it knowing what it comes from. Not a huge operation and very peaceful. No pressure to buy the coffee but it tastes so damn good we had too. Our taster spoke very good English and had a great story about what he wants to do in life. Sorta sad to listen to it but he was very optimistic about his future. Listen, talk, enjoy coffee and relax in this beautiful setting!"

You are then shown the beans in a few states of processing. Then the sad part happens when you are offered to hold a bat which clearly doesn't like being out during day, never mind the rabies situation in Bali and the risk to you health. After which you are shown a hedgehog and four darling little animals in cages. After this you head to a table to sample tea and coffee all of which are lovely. You then are encouraged to purchase tea and coffee to take home for about $15aud a bag which we did as we felt we had to as there was no charge for the other elements. Honestly I wouldn't come back due to the animals being shown however the coffee and tea is nice so maybe if you are a bit less sensitive then it would be okay."

To be honest I wasn't really up for it - but when we stopped and got out I knew it wasn't what I thought at all.You are led through the plantation by a guide that tells you all about the coffee beans as well as the cocoa they grow too. Everything is done by hand - it takes 45mins to roast the coffee beans over a fire (which was damn hot for the lady sitting there doing it) and about 2 hours to do a kilogram of beans (I hope I have remembered that correctly).Everything is very well orchestrated - and it doesn't have to be a long stop either - we were in and out within an hour I would say. After you go through the plantation and hear about the process and of course the Luwak and the \"poo\" coffee (*giggle* from my 5 year old daughter)...you get to do a full taste test of all the teas and coffees they produce. We loved just about all of them - we bought the Vanilla coffee, Coconut coffee, Mango tea, Rice (yes Rice) tea and Lemongrass tea. And of course...had to get the 100% cocoa powder for hot chocolate for my daughter.It was well worth the trip and I would say definitely make this as a stop on your way to or from Kintamani. And its not tedious for kiddies either - short enough to manage!A big thank you to the team at Satri - we are still drinking your coffee here at home and enjoying it...thinking of you!"

The Tea tasting platter was amazing.It was so well explained, by a sweet host, smiling, patient...every time I liked something, he would be so happy for me! Everyone who works there is super king and ... It was delish!! Full descriptions of the medicinal virtues and subtleties...wow!!!Then when the host told me I could go to the boutique to but these products, well...I could bring these delicious tea, coffee and honey back home with me.As a matter of fact I had some Balinese honey last night at home, and like magic, I was brought right back to the most beautiful island I've ever visited!!!!"

We never felt rushed or pressured to buy anything.The only negative from the whole visit was being ambushed in the parking by street peddlers after the visit to the plantation.

Unfortunately the mongoose are held in very small cages with bars on the floor so I would like to suggest that improvements are made to the housing of these animals please!We were seated in a shady area at the end of the tour and brought out a big selection of teas and coffees to try. The 'special' mongoose poo coffee is not included - this is charged at 50K rupiah per glass if you want to try (we did just for the fun but it's not very nice!). All the drinks have a lot of sugar in so taste quite nice, but we really liked the mangosteen tea, coconut tea and spiced chocolate drinks so decided to buy these in their shop at the end. They also sell spices and other bits. The prices are not cheap but I had no issue with buying the ones we wanted (and they accept credit card). Beware - they have a snake in a box by the shop where they try to get you to hold it for a picture (I imagine for a fee). My husband hates snakes so we made it very clear to our guide who told the photo lady no for us. "

Buyer beware the super expensive lewak coffee is simply not good, brought some home and expertly brewed it...the cheaper bali coffee is better but even that is overpriced. Conclusion: avoid if possible, but if you take a tour (which you should also avoid) you will inevitably stop here, but you can at least breeze through quickly!"

Who can forget that wonderful scene in the hospital room when Morgan Freeman so gently debunks Jack Nicholson's elitist coffee bean and service gear? Well here it is - the genuine kopi luwak (sp?) coffee bean and the animals that 'produce' it. Here it's dubbed 'cappoochino'! And, yes, it must be the most expensive coffee in the world and, frankly, we didn't think it was worth it. You get to sample (for free) about 12 different coffees and teas (a couple of which were outstanding) but you have to pay for the poo bean coffee. This plantation is worth a stop for sure. It's free, the attendants are sweet and friendly and I even got to stir some beans that were being roasted."

My husband and I and three year old daughter went to the coffee plantation, we had a private guide who showed us all the different plants growing on the farm before handing us off to the staff who explained the coffee process to us! It was great to know I'm not the only one with grounds in my coffee - the Balinese don't use coffee filters! We enjoyed the samples, even my daughter loved the teas and took a small sip of the coffees. We bought some treasures to take home for family too"

It is pricey but tastes so good. The staff explain how it's made so it's no wonder it's expensive. Well worth the visit."

If you lock them in cages and feed them any beans, it defeats the purpose! Now you just have poo coffee, and really sad-looking cute animals :-("

We were met by a guide who explained the plants and fruit trees as we walked down to the Lewak animal cages. I've never seen a giant passionfruit before, it was the size of a football ! The cages each had one animal per cage with fresh coffee beans for consumption. Then there was the pooped beans waiting for collection. We then saw the beans drying, roasting, grinding process etc. It was all very interesting. Finally we went to the sampling balcony where there are tables to sit at whilst waiting for free samples of teas and coffees. Each tray had a variety of seven samples. We did purchase a cup of the Luwak coffee and it is absolutely an acquired taste. This is a definite must do tour."

There are lots of other fruits growing there which were nice to see in their natural environment. The girls there explained about how the coffee is processed and how the Lewak coffee is different. You get to try several different types of organic teas as well as different coffees for free, however you do need to pay to try the Lewak coffee. i was looking forward to trying it, but strangely enough it wasn't as nice as the normal Bali coffee. The ginger tea is to die for and so good for you."

The staff there are amazing, relaxed and are happy to sit and chat to you about their lives and villages etc. The teas and coffees are all free samples and you could sit there for hours looking over the forest drinking the amazing teas and coffees and never spend a cent. Once you are finished before you leave make sure you go through the shop and buy some of the teas to take home with you! We bought heaps and we are still drinking them! Wishing we bought more!"

A guide greets you and takes you on a quick tour (15-20 min) of the farm where they explain the process of how they make the poop coffee, show you all the various spices they also grow there which was very cool. You then grab a table along a mountain side with incredible views and they bring you 8 different coffees and teas to sample for free all made from the ingredients from the farm (ginseng tea, cocoa, vanilla coffee and more). If you want to try the poop coffee it was $5 CAD. You can walk down and out on to a wooden terrace for a further view and great picture opportunity. Once you're done your coffee samplers you walk through a store where you can buy some of what you tried if you like. They weren't pushy and didn't force you to make a purchase though. Neat experience to try if you have about an hour."

This is well worth a visit .Firstly there is the walk through the gardens where there is every imaginable fruit and plant -bring a local guide to get a full explanation - by the way everybody in Ubud seems to know all local details! Then you see the traditional way of coffee making - still in use. Then to the sampling menu of coffees and teas for free unless you want to taste he 'special one'. Everything is explained in detail by the gentle hostess. I think I have kept several illnesses at bay as a result of the various teas I drank. Then off to the shop - but no pressure to buy anything- still it is hard to resist all those 'cures'."

( there are many plantations in a row, so perhaps they all have a view )? you try out approx 12 types of coffee/teas. some are REALLY good. ( i wish i would have bought the lemon grass tea ), but i bought mangosteen & rosella ( which is different from rose! ) and i bought bali coffee. this plantation is organic. thats why i bought here as opposed to a cheaper market, because i know its organic. yes, its cheaper in the markets. at the end of the tastings they ask if you want to try the luwak coffee for 50,000IDR ( approx $4.50 USA ) . this is the Luwak animal poo coffee. i tried it because this is probably how the guy gets paid. and they probably get commission by what you buy in their shop. so if you like the guy, buy up."
