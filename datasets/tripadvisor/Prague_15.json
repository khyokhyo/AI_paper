Castle environs are additional attraction, less overwhelmed by tourist crowds then the castle area itself. There are Castle (southern) gardens that can be reached by scenic old stairs (Stare Zamecke schody, close to metro station Malostranska) from which breath-taking city views open. The gardens themselves are serene and beautiful. Then, there is Castle square with several palaces, museums and galleries, also cafes and restaurants, if hungry."

The cathedral is gothic yet the guide said some 20th century additions have been made. The grounds are impressive with a panoramic view of the city. Most of the gardens were in the winter mode but the landscaping befits a palace. The Golden Alley is full of little cottages that offer every souvenir sold in the city but the cobbled streets give the place an old world charm."

Inside you can buy combinations tickets - so you are free to choose if you want to see everything or nothing. I would recommend the B-tour which will give you the old castle, the cathedral, the goldworkers lane and the basilica. I especially loved the cathedral and the old castle.There are a few cafees inside the area, but don't expect too much of the food. And if it's cold it will be difficult to get a place to eat inside."

The Castle District can be seen from across the river and the best way to reach it is on foot by crossing Charles Bridge and straight up through the main street which is lined with interesting shops and eateries. The Castle District is crammed full of interesting buildings and entry into the Castle grounds is free although you need to purchase a ticket to view many of the interiors of the buildings. Allow about 4 hours to see everything that the ticket covers. For those that cannot manage the climb up the hill you can take a tram which does not go up the main street but goes round and up the the side of the hill. So much to see, so little time so we had to go twice and still did not see everything."

Better to enter from the Belvedere to the northeast or the Stary zam schiody, a stairway into the Bastion in the east. The St. Vitus Cathedral is big, but on a European scale not particularly interesting. In order to understand the importance of the the Old Royal Palace you need to know a lot about Central European and Czech history. Be advised that one or the other (or the Basilica of St. George) can be closed arbitrarily and without warning."

I found that using the next bridge north, the Manesuv most, to be more pleasant. To get to the castle complex itself you have a couple of options. Because the President lives in the complex, there is significant security and you need to think strategically about getting in. Near the Malostranska tram stop (six different trams stop here) you can walk up a long, but not steep, series of stairs. There is seldom a security back up on this route. Tram 22 will drop you off at \"up the hill\" at Prazsky hrad where these is a main entrance to the complex and lines could be 1 hour long--or 2 minutes--hard to figure. You can stay on the tram one stop further to Brusnice and follow U Brusnice (cross the street and head sort of south) to the main palace entrance--could also be ridiculously crowded. Or, if you are following U Brusnice, look for a green area on your left before you get near the palace. There will be a guard and some steps down into a garden. The guard will check you out--open backpack, wand for metals, etc.--and then let you enter the garden which will take you, in less than five minutes, right into the main castle complex by a cafe. Go figure--so easy. So--go through the garden or up the steps--avoid the lines. Once \"inside\" you need to decide what to do--and much of it costs money. St. Vitus is interesting. Once when I walked by it was closed for a church service, the second time there were hundreds of people in line, the third time I just walked in and was able to ogle the stained glass and surroundings as long as I wanted. You only need to pay if you want to do a serious circuit around the whole church. If you are a Mucha fan, the Mucha stained glass is on the left as you face the altar--the third one in from the ropes that keep the non-paying sightseers from the main part of the church. Easy to see and there were several other fairly modern stained-glass windows that are really interesting. You will not see the famed Golden Lane without paying--they have an actual turnstile!"

It was not as good as we thought but it was fun to try this Prague specialty. The castle itself is enormous and still guarded; walking around outside is free but there is a price to enter the castle. We got there too late to go in but just in time to enjoy a parade marking 700 years of the coronation of the King.

Take the 22 Tram and enjoy the views as it climbs the hill on the western side of the city, get off at Pohorelec it's much easier way to the castle. Cross the road from the tram stop and wander down the cobblestoned street passing lovely shops en route, restaurants and bars, we even heard a choir practicing in one of the nearby building which sounded beautiful on the night air. En route is the Loreta Church and grounds, there is an entrance charge but a totally unacceptable photographic charge as well. Frankly don't pay it, just take the photos! Again there are beautiful artefacts and works of art representing the history and wealth of this particular order nof the Roman Catholic Church. By now you may be thirsty or hungry the Uzavesenyho Kafe has a cooling terrace to look over the city or towards Petrin Hill. Afterwards, duly fed and watered stroll down to the castle and marvel and the hundreds willing to stand in the baking sun to go into the grounds. There is a flight of stairs to the right and left of the food outlets that leads down to the old town area with fascinating shops en route. After a while it leads to Charles Bridge which to be honest is not worth the pushing and shoving during the day."

You can either take a tour or wander around on your own. The cathedral in the centre of the castle dominates most photo opportunities as it is very spectacular. The streets are cobbled and the architecture is out of this world. Plenty of bars and restaurants and cafes in the area as well as parks and shops. A walk up to the castle area at the top involves 200 steps which is not for the faint hearted but you can take the tram if you wish."

Both are beautiful palaces that exhibit large collections of art.But the hidden gem of this district is Novy Svet (New World). This little picturesque narrow street with small houses has preserved it's unique character. While the Prague Castle and its immediate surroundings were packed with loud crowds of tourists, we were the the only people in this quiet and almost hidden part of the Castle District.There is also the Loreta, with the clock tower and the famous chime, and the Church of St. John of Nepomuk, but I did not have the chance to enter those. But even without them - I had a great few hours spent without even entering the castle."

Just don't be startled when they bash the glass down on the table! The prices of food and drink are slightly cheaper here. We found a great place to eat and drink opposite St Nicolas Church.

Loved the cobblestone streets and the cafes and the views from the hillside. There are so many things to do here. We took the funicular up to the top and saw the locals call their Eiffel tower. We didn't go up but instead, we wandered the upper gardens and visited the cloister, then went to the castle. We missed the changing of the guard at noon and on the hour, but we've heard the noontime change is well worth it. Going inside the palace grounds is free, but you must have a ticket to enter many of the buildings. You can go into the church for free but you are limited to a small area without a ticket."

It's a long walk, and the hill is quite steep. The streets are not very well marked, and the way is winding and confusing at times. The maps we had were not so great either. If you walk, plan to spend the whole day doing this. When we got to the top (complex) we had a very hard time finding some of the places mentioned in our guide book. A ticket is required for visiting the interiors of the buildings in the castle complex. By the time we figured out where we were, we chose to just wander around the streets and gardens, which are charming enough. We stopped at one of the small cafes for cappuccino and cheesecake, which were quite respectable in spite of the plain surroundings of the cafe. It is possible to enter the cathedral without paying an entry fee, but going further in requires purchasing a ticket. A quick look was enough for us. I was disappointed not to have time to visit the National Gallery exhibitions at two of the palaces in the complex, but we simply did not have enough time, and were worn out by the walk. The sheer scale of the complex is daunting. I would recommend taking the tram instead (#22 from Old Town) and expecting to spend the better part of a day there. This is an impressive place, but time, planning, and energy are required."

(There is also Golden Lane, a collection of small dwellings, and this was the only disappointment for us - ok but not great.) The views of Prague from the battlements are incredible. There are also gardens and a treasury, which we didn't get round to exploring because we ran out of time.

Make sure you confirm the fare in advance as some drivers love to scam you. We found the fare should be around 100 Czk koruna or about $5.00 but were charged double on earlier trips before we figured out the deal. Still cheap at either price. Once you enter the grounds you need to decide what ticket to purchase. We opted for the tour 1 which included about 5 different sites. Must see is the Cathedral and old palace. Ticket is 350 Czk koruna or about $17 US. Treasury visits extra. Ticket is good for 2 days which is helpful as lots to see if you read everything...... many exhibits have multi-language sign. Building II houses display on history of Prague. If really into it, history of various kings, who when why and where, plus clothes, of the period, video of whole complex history....need a couple of hours just this one building. Consider renting the audio guide for $17 plus refundable deposit of about $25. Particularly good in the Cathedral."

It offers many opportunities for great views of the city as well as a glimpse into the rich culture and history of this great city! We got a little turned around on our way down from the castle and ended up walking through a nice little park with a pathway, fountain and perfectly manicured grass.P.S. You can't walk on the grass. The views were incredible here with a walk out overlook area that is great for photo ops. On the way down the stairs back to the town there is a little cafe. Stop in for a coffee!"

You will also be overcharged at restaurants, the closer to the castle the more ridiculous the prices get. You may also be swindled by being talked into buying a traditional Czech trinket that was actually made in China."

We were told to come back 3 days later??!! We went back 2 days later, it was raining, cold, and the place was packed with tour groups. We ended up standing in a lineup outside (in rain) because they only had 2 people processing tickets. Once we paid for 3 adults, it was then (and only then) that they told us the the lineups were so long we would never get into any of the sites. They were right....there were hundreds and hundreds of people in the line. What is rather annoying is that this information was not provided prior to our paying the fee. We ended up leaving............so disappointed with the way this is handled!!"

Beautiful walks through gardens and up and down wide, stone stairways and cobbled walkways. Nerudova street is lovely. We stayed on Nerudova at The Hotel Golden Wheel. Great, friendly, well-appointed small hotel in a fantastic location. The Castle District & Hotel Golden Wheel are both romantic locations. I was just there celebrating my wife & my 33rd wedding anniversary.... No better location could exist for our celebration!"

The walk was less intimidating than I expected but challenging nevertheless. Can only be done with good walking shoes and would be tough it was very hot. It is a long climb and fairly steep in some places although we saw many older people (like ourselves) and young children too. We stopped for water at the restaurant halfway up, nice views, pleasant although staff a bit surly. At the top there are plenty of things to see and do including a mini-Eiffel tower. Gorgeous parks and plantings so nice for a picnic lunch and people watching. Lots of restaurants there too. We found that visiting the many, many castles in the castle complex was exhausting and confusing as some are well marked but others not. I suppose there is a special map you can get to help with navigating the maze of buildings, lanes and squares. All of the architecture is beautifully restored and maintained and is an absolute treasure trove of architectural styles and details for the art lover.If you are going for the architecture and the castle specifically I would recommend a cab up there and maybe a walk down as I felt too weary to take it all in. We did not do the actual castle tour as the crowds were epic. It is the 700th anniversary celebration this year for King Charles and the Czech Crown Jewels were on display which is very rare, so I think tours were there for that especially, too. There are many small cafes and taverns all over the Castle complex and well sign posted WCs everywhere so you don't need to worry about going thirsty or hungry. If you like breathtaking panoramic views and Royal splendor, this experience is not to be missed. I don't care much for either but I am glad that I did see it. Having more information about the climb and the tours would have made it more enjoyable plus I do not like crowds so that was a downer for me personally."

The royal gardens are a delightful (and downhill) stroll.

In any case, my visit started perfectly as i managed to catch the changing of the guard in the Hradcanske square, in front of the old Royal Palace. From there i spent quite some time at the St. Vitus Cathedral, admiring it from every possible angle and taking lots of pictures (you can't blame it - it's fantastic!). Probably one of the things that i enjoyed the most was the Golden Lane - a narrow street full of tiny, colorful old houses. I would have never imagined such a place could still exist right next to a grand monument like the cathedral. These houses belonged to the city's artisans long ago and now they were turned into museums. I enjoyed one that was filled with pieces of armor & weapons but also houses of artists and writers (including one where Kafka stayed for a while).Later on, i went to see Daliborka tower which was actually a prison back in the day. All of this lasted for a few hours so i ended my tour at a nearby Panorama Coffe place, to chill out a bit and enjoy a good view of the city."

Warm people, fewer crowdes, especially stag party men. Enjoyed wandering the quieter streets contemplating the history.

I explored only like half of it because I didn't research enough to start my way through the easy path, but I totally loved it.If you are physically fit, climbing up the New Castle Stairs near Malostranska MRT will reward you a magnificent view of red-roofed pretty buildings (likely of the castle district) from waaay up. I believe you cannot just explore everything in one day, especially if some places are closed in one season and you happen to go in the season where it is closed.According to the Prague Castle official website, I went in with option 3. As soon as I entered, I saw Lobkowicz Palace and the Toy Museum. Traversing around the Castle District is free, but to go in certain locations you'd need to have a paid ticket available. There was a road signpost and there were buildings that look like medieval old houses-- and then of course Prague's cobblestone roads decorate the castle district roads.Walking around the district may get confusing, so I suggest getting a map, but if you don't mind getting lost, I think you wouldn't mind getting lost in a place like this! Except maybe if your feet is hurting...All in all, as long as you're not in a 1 or 2 day trip to Prague, I say that exploring this area is worth it! Oh and if you go in December, there's a Christmas market too but I forgot where exactly it was located in the castle area."

It was an independent borough till 1784' after which it was united with the three other similar units to form a single city. Major chunk of buildings in this area belong to the castle complex. This is the largest castle complex in the world with a length of 570 meters. The Cathedral of Saint Vitus is also situated here. You can also see several palaces of the nobles here. This area was the site of a Slav settlement during the seventh century. There has been a castle here since the end of the ninth century. Ironically it has been noticed that whoever has occupied the Hrad has had political control over the Czechs. It became truly a royal town in 1598. Since then it's raison d'etre has been the castle. You can find history in every nook and cranny of this district."

I can't remember which one section we chose to not do, but there was only one. We really enjoyed walking through the area and the buildings. At the very end of our visit we ended up near the dungeon, which I do recommend going down to see. It's really only about a 3-5 minute visit, but it was quite interesting (&, of course, cruel). I think we spent about 2 hours here, but could've spent another hour or so. Some people spend 5 hours here, but that would've been too much for us. There is a decent amount of walking and some stairs."

The climb up to the Castle and Cathedral is relatively easy and it is essential to pause a while on the way up to admire the spectacular view over old Prague. The Cathedral itself is an awesome sight. Its soaring towers are majestic and its Gothic architecture is magnificent! Allow a full day to explore the Cathedral and Castle area of Prague and make sure to take advantage of the combined entry ticket to save on cost. We discovered later that the tickets are valid for two or three days so a return visit can be made if time runs out - and it inevitably will, before you complete your visit. It is possible to walk the whole area and one is constantly rewarded with amazing vistas across the city."

There lays the old castle and a lot of parks. Remember that many of those parks (and generally most parks in Prague) are closed during winter. Anyway, in the castle area you can visit (by buying a ticket) the palace itself, the st.Vitus cathedral, the st.George Basilica, the golden lane and a lot of other stuff. There are combo tickets where you can visit a lot of things with one ticket and I think that you can buy a ticket for everything separatelly as well. If you are there, I suggest that you visit the st.Vitus cathedral and the golden lane (especially if you have small children). The palace rooms were really interesting but no big deal comparing to the cathedral. Concluding, the castle district is a beautifull place to start you journey in Prague. Remember to visit it early in the morning or late in the evening if you don't like crowdy visits. Also at 12.00 (I think) the guards are being replaced during a big ceremony which is worth watching."

Narrow cobblestoned pathways wending up the hill to the castle, with shops on either side crowded about selling Czech cuisine to souvenirs. Lots of tourists obviously, but also a place where it seems, from a casual observation, like the locals actually live and thrive. (some tourist places I've seen are really just for tourists, and where locals just work). The castle grounds are quite large; I didn't bother with going into any of the buildings, but you get a good view of Prague at the top of the hill. The Cathedral on the Castle grounds is also truly magnificent.Also caught what I guess is the 'changing of the guard' ceremony at the castle gate.Walking up the hill is a bit tiring as the incline is quite steep, so good shoes are really helpful."

At leisure and window shopping it is a wonderful 45 minute walk. If you are more determined you can make it in 30 minutes, but the entire way is worth seeing. You take Charles Street which is winding and filled with interesting shops all the way to Charles Bridge, which is beautiful and worth crossing on foot as it is completely pedestrian and filled with artists and artisans' fares to offer, then you commence the uphill trek to the Castle District. During the way up, which can be tiring for someone handicapped or elderly or simply out of shape, you can stop and rest in one of the many cafes along the way. Also, nearing the last part of the trek you must stop and admire the view of the city from this hill. People line up along the way to take pictures of the city with the beautiful red tile roofs and many church towers and spirals. Once you reach the Castle you might be lucky enough to witness the change in guard. Cross through the courtyard and go around to see St. Vitus Cathedral which is magnificent in all Gothic Splendor with amazingly tall and delicate stained glass windows. Since we were visiting in December, there were Christmas Markets by the east facade of the Cathedral and on the way up to the Castle. A wonderful inexpensive and delicious offering of lunch options if you don't mind standing while eating or locating a bench. The visit to the Castle District is definitely a must. A note: Before you begin your climb uphill to the Castle District after crossing the Charles Bridge, make a short detour to the left and go only a few blocks to visit the Church of The Baby Jesus of Prague (Or the Prague Child). It is quite famous and many devout people follow it and well worth the visit. When we visited, there were adorable donkeys, miniature horses, goats and sheep in a makeshift stable in front of the Church's steps."

We could sense a slight differing style of layout and building features. The early way to show who lived or used a building was to have engravings or signs outside near the main door way so people would know where to find someone of a certain profession. This area is quite hilly in contrast to the Old and new town areas. But well worth spending time in."

We went to the tourist information where we presumed they sold tickets. They did not and we were sent off elsewhere to buy tickets. You have many options including what to see and whether with a tourist guide or not. We took the tourist guide but she was not very good repeating herself at least 3 - 4 times for each tidbit of information that she provided. I would suggest to skip the tourist guide and to take the basic package which already allowed a lot of visiting around in the cavernous complex and huge grounds. One thing not to miss is the Golden Lane which was included in our basic ticket. These are teensy tiny dwellings that were lived in until the last century.

Prague Castle is a compound comprised of St. Vitas Cathedral, Lobkowicz Palace and Golden Lane. St. Vitas is so very beautiful. We did not enter Lobkowicz which is a museum. Outside Lobkowicz, we saw a changing of the guard and took pictures from the balcony. At the foot of Lobkowicz is a garden area which was lovely to walk through. There is a cafe inside Lobkowicz which has a pretty view from the terrace. We stepped in just to see the view that someone had written about. Golden Lane, to the back of the Castle is a street of very small charming homes circa 1500s. Home #22 was Kafka's residence for a short time. If you venture to the Lesser Quarter (Mala Strana) from here, be sure to visit the gorgeous St. Nicholas Church! Also, if you're looking for an excellent restaurant in The Lesser Quarter, I highly recommend Bar Bar! My husband had the risotto with mushrooms and I had duck with pea puree...one of our two best meals in our five nights in Prague. enjoy!"

In fact if you are visiting the castle and St Vitus cathederal then you just have to visit the castle district. Prague is rich in its history and having a good guide book is a must. There are also many tours to be had in this area and joining one is not a bad idea. Be warned it is packed in the summer but at the same time quite beautiful in the evening light. Lots of little bars and eateries just watch the prices before you go in. There are some reasonable priced venues and the food is whole sum and tasty for the most part."

The core of the district is the Castle complex & its series of courtyards & gardens. There are two sets of old steps stairs leading to & from Castle Hill ... coming down via old Z\u00e1mecke schody (although there is over 200 steps) is much easier! The elevated location of Hrad\u010dany affords views across the Vltava River to the Old & New Towns of Prague."

I decided to go to this area through Mal\u00e1 Strana, a park on a hill with a lot of statues, a historic fortress and a great view over Prague. This made the experience better, because it took some effort to reach the goal. I simply loved the complete setting of the area; the architecture (great piece of mannerist architecture!), the cobblestones, the cathedral and the Golden Lane. Don't forget your camera! TIP1: It can be really crowded and you will see a lot of checklist-tourists and selfiesticks (its disturbing for me), if you dont want to see them, you can better go in the mornings. TIP2: Really nice to see; the changing of guard. 12 o\u00e7lock every day! For free"

When you reach the castle don't bother getting a ticket outside where the long lines are, go into the area where the church is, before going into the St Vidas Cathederal turn right and go into the ticket office on your right.

There are some beautiful little churches, and buildings just a block or 2 off the main street. Make sure to check out Strahovsky Monastery & Library. They make the beer on-site and have several cafes to choose from. Also, check out the library which is seen many times in BBC's The Musketeers.Also don't miss Kampa Island. As you are heading to the castle area to the left about 250 feet before the end of the bridge, there is a staircase that takes you down to it. Should you miss that staircase, there is another one as the end of the bridge. It is just a peaceful little place with big trees, cute little shops and cafes and some little huts to get food and drinks. A nice little sanctuary.I think the thing that amazed us the most is how quickly the castle district empties out at the end of the day. As the sun is setting, you see the mass exodus of the tour groups heading back across the bridge. It makes crossing the bridge and sitting in one of the cafes over there so peaceful!"

The cafes and shopping and people watching around this area is terrific. We had a memorable good time. I highly recommend."

We took a walk across the bridge and then onto a tram (train if you will) up the hill to the Western Part of the Castle - This is a great idea, because you start from the 'back' of the castle and work your way forward, against the crowds, so VERY thought out. Michael had a very easy going style to his tour. Funny, but not in the way where it might seem to be rehearsed, but more so in a way where it was situational.We took a little break for coffee in the afternoon, and ended with the BEST view of the castle from the side facing the river, so you could see the entire Old town from there. Great historical insight - political insight as well (because it is still where the active president lives (not in the castle but on the grounds)) and also, where parliament is. After the tour he took time to talk to each of us, answered questions, and really made an effort to make us feel welcome.

St Vitus cathedral is truly stunning and the royal gardens are nice place to take a walk and relax. Be sure to see the change of guards (at noon) and if you have time - visit the castle in the night time (open till 10 p.m. in summer). The lighting of the cathedral and view of the Prague at night is remarkable. Tip: do not buy the ticket - the entering part of cathedral is free (ticket is only if you want to visit the whole church) and arrive at exactly 5 p.m. for the Golden lane (after 5 it is free of charge and the shops are still open till about 5.30)."

I was surprised to learn there are about 25 residences together with a cathedral and other churches that form this District. You need at least a day to walk and discover it all. Stop and have lunch at one of the many restaurants in the district. Don't miss the cathedral which dominates the site. The changing of the guard takes places daily with due pomp and trumpets playing."

My advice would be to travel there in mid to late Spring . . . when all the trees begin to blossom and flowers bloom, and the city isn't overcrowded with summer tourists. Begin your first day in Prague at the upper end of Vaclavske Namesti (Wenceslas Square) at around 1 or 2 pm or so . . . make your way down from the horse statue near the front of Muzeum to Mustek square at the end of Vaclsvske Namesti, stopping at whatever shops or etc. that pique your interest. then continue straight down the narrowing street (not far off of Mustek you will see the Estates Theater (Stavovske Divadlo) where Mozart first presented his opera Don Giovani!!) . . . a beautiful theater .... Try to get tickets to see Don Giovani performed here ... there are often very interesting takes on this classic opera! Continue winding down the same street (I believe it is called Melantrichova at this point....but you should be able to easily follow the flow of foot traffic at this point), until you find yourself in the Old Town Square (Staromestke Namesti), looking up at the old Astronomical Clock (Orloj ... the prince who commissioned the building of this clock had the architect's eyes burned out of his head upon its completion, not wanting another like it to ever be built .... In a brilliant stroke of revenge, the architect/designer of the clock had one of his apprentices go deep into the clock and remove one tiny piece .... and for more than 300 years, nobody could figure out how to make the clock work!!). That church you see to your right, tucked behind a row of Baroque buildings, is called Tyn Chapel . . . poke your head inside and look up to your left . . . you will see a tiny window oddly looking over the main chapel area . . . that is the window of an apartment Franz Kafka lived in for a time! The famous Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe is buried in this church . . . for what reason? I have no idea! :) Wander the square as long as you like, but not later than the onset of dusk . . . you have more walking to do before then . . . Return to the old Astronomical clock and walk straight down Male Namesti (you will see a Hardrock Cafe on your right shortly after starting down this road . . . buy a T-shirt there . . . why not??) . . . continue down this road, which will curve to the left and become Karlova . . . take the first right to continue on Karlova . . . turn right on Husova for a few steps, then left again to continue on Karlova. There are too many interesting little shops and things to see along this road . . . so try to notice as much as you can as you walk along (note: most street musicians in Prague are amazingly talented.... almost always worth stopping and enjoying.... be sure to tip!!). You will pass a few churches on your way until you reach Krizovnicka (be careful crossing this street.... trams and cars stop for no one when they have the right of way in this town!). After you have crossed this street, turn around and notice the statues of each of the martyred apostles lining the rooftop (beautiful Baroque statues!). By now you will know what you have walked all this way to see . . . the Charles Bridge (Karluv Most) . . . If you have timed your walk correctly, you will have reached this most amazing of medieval bridges (originally constructed in the late 14th/early 15th centuries) . . . the Baroque statues that line the bridge and give it it's unique character, were added one by one, beginning in the early 1700s. From Karluv Most you will see Hradcany . . . the spectacular Prague Castle, brilliantly lit as dusk settles in to early evening, under a deep blue sky, with the last strains of light from the setting sun disappear over the horizon. This is how I first experienced Prague . . . It was late April, 1991, and I began my journey from a small house in Prague 4 into a city about which I knew not a thing . . . In my ethnocentric ignorance (as a typical American), I thought Prague would be a poverty stricken, dilapidated mess . . . instead I found an absolute gem, right in the heart of Europe! Continue across Karluv Most into Mala Strana and make your way up to the castle (Hradcany) . . . again . . . too much to see and experience for me to go into detail here . . . but make a point of going into the catacombs of Svaty Vitus (St. Vitus Cathedral) in the heart of the castle, and take a walk down Zlata Ulice (the Golden Way), where the diminutive alchemists once lived (note that Franz Kafka also lived for a time in a flat on this little street inside the castle!). I hope this lengthy entry helps somebody enjoy Prague that much more than they might otherwise have! By the way . . . I have returned to Prague multiple times since returning to the United States in 1995 . . . it is still every bit as magical as it ever was!"

Magnificent historic buildings all around. Do take an official tour, you will learn so much more than by just wandering aimlessly. I lost count of how many bridal parties we saw, it's great to see the city being embraced by its' people. It's easy to see that Prague has been the capital city of several historic empires over the centuries, there's not a plain building in sight with everything done to please the eye. I had lunch at the open air restaurant in the square at the rear of St Vitus' Cathedral, sitting at a table under the tree. Perfect! From there it's a downhill walk with wonderful vistas and entertainments all the way down to the Lesser Town below. A great way to spend a day."

Once in, visit the St Vitus cathedral, which is to me the best thing in castle. Architecture is amazing, windows beautiful. St Jiri cathedral is nice as well, do not miss the Golden Lane, with beautiful houses, today furnished as those merchants lived there, for example, herbalist's home, then taylor's house, there's even a house that was used by Kafka. This must be one of best things in the Castle. You need at least 4-5 hours for this amazing complex and its gardens.In castle district there are Mostecka and Nerudova str, not to be missed, beautiful antique shops and cafes, nice architecture."

If you like walking, there's a good circular route from Wenceslas Square past the Opera House, over the bridge, into the park to the funicular railway station that brings you up to the Petrin tower. You can also walk up the hill to the tower and stop at the restaurant on the way. The tower has 299 steps to the top, is a replica of the Eiffel tower, affords superb panoramic views across the whole city and will sway in the wind in even a light breeze so not good for people with a nervous disposition. It has restaurants and facilities at the bottom and another walk across the park will bring you to the beer making monks and further into the castle complex. All the signs are in Czech so use your smartphone satnav and/or the free maps. Whilst the castle area is spectacular, the queues and crowds in August were prohibitive, so we kept walking down to the Charles Bridge and back through the Jewish quarter to the old town Square.

The area was very busy, but to be expected in the middle of the high season, so maybe arrive earlier in the day to avoid some of the crowds. There were lots of buildings to see without paying (like us!) for a tour or tickets. The ticket system did seem a bit complicated with lots of different combinations and there were very big queues for the information desk. Be sure to walk the gardens, as this is where the best views were!

If on foot, I found the best way to go through the Charles Bridge, go up just straight ahead, and go up the stairs at the street \"Radnick\u00e9 schody\", close to Schwarzenberg Palace.All you need to do then is to slowly approach to east. Most of the museums and palaces inside are wonderful sights by themselves but take up a lot of time if visited. For a quick trip, I advise not to miss the St Vitus cathedral (in the middle of the castle), the Golden Lane (touristic, but still), the view points in the east over the city, and the lovely, romantic stair leading back down to the city."

Enjoy panoramic views of this beautiful city and its river.  Don't miss Lobkowicz Palace (a somewhat hidden gem). Golden Lane is a fascinating journey into the past beautifully presented and preserved. Wander down through the winding streets of the Mala Strana and visit the John Lennon Peace Wall. Keep your eyes peeled for David Cherny's quirky and original sculptures .. always interesting and amusing."

Walking up to the castle requires endurance and a level of stamina. You should definitely take the Tram there - catch the 22 LINE - it's easy. The castle itself is not like ones you see in England, it is more like a walled city but that does not take away its charm. Walk down in to Prague, just taking in the sights."

You'll end up near the Malostransk\u00e1 Metro stop, which is also a collection point for many tram lines. The entire transit system is VERY easy to use! This way you'll take the transit system up the hill, and be able to leisurely walk down the hill.When you first get off the tram, be sure to visit the gardens on the left hand side, especially the birds exhibit.While there are fees to enter some parts of the castle area, the church is free to enter."

Built on the site of a former rotunda from 929 year. The castle itself is like a city within a city. - Small streets, the cathedral, many courtyards and other smaller churches. Rear entrance of the castle reaches directly the Black Tower and the palace \"Lobkowitz\", continues in a small street, in countries where there are several courtyards and reaches the modest square in front of the Golden lane.

It would have been really helpful if the lady at the counter would have given us some suggestions on the sites to cover. Our first stop within the castle was the church. It is very historical and I would advice taking a guided tour if you want to know more about the history and the details. We hired the radio guide, which did not give justice. We also noticed that in the church there was an entrance were everyone was entering for free which was a bit disappointing. We then covered two other spots, another small chapel and the museum, both were less interesting. We spend around 3-4 hours, but if plan to see the other attractions, I would advice to spend the entire day there.My recommendations is to review all the ticket options and select the ticket with the attraction you are interested in.

I went up to Hradcany District 3 days, but i really needed 5, and should of been there at 10am each day. And then I might have fitted it all in. I completely missed Loreta Monastery, didn't get to have a good wander around the streets of the district, and missed 2 of the 7 sights on my 2 Day Castle/Palace ticket. And i spent a good 3 days up there.My first day I'd left my camera behind, and was 1pm so (in hindsight wisely) decided to not enter any of the historical sights and have a good wander around and through all that makes up the Castle/Palace district - this allowed me to take lots of exterior shots on my camera so it was less of a priority on other visits. Then found nice pub with Prague Cider for rest (v happy), walked right up to top of mountain and got good view of Loreta etc, and found great vegan resturant way down.The other 2 days i bought a full 2 day ticket, however ran out of time and missed the Powder Tower (told didn't miss much) & Picture Gallery. My 2nd day i only saw 2 sights in 6 hours. Ended my 3rd day in St Vitus Catherdal...only 70mins until kicked out & needed another hour. If you are really into history allow at least 3/4 days, 5 if want to see the Monastery and have good wander. If not into history I'd still recommend 2 days, unless you hire a Segway and don't enter any sights. Highlight of my E. European trip so far (Vienna to come).

The orchard from the monastery is still there and you get lovely views down to Prague and the castle. I was there in Spring when the trees had blossom on them. It is then just a short walk to the old city walls and the district known as Pohorelec. Some of the houses here are really old. From here you can walk straight towards the castle but it is worth taking a detour past the rococo Loreto to Novy Svet or New World.which is a picturesque street of houses built for workers at the castle in the 17th century. Tycho Brahe the famous astronomer lived in this street.There is so much to do do and see in this part of Prague. Recommendations to allow a whole day are absolutely correct. In fact in a whole day you can't possibly visit all the palaces. The guided tour of the castle is worth doing. I thought we spent too much time in St Vitus' Cathedral and would have preferred more time in the Royal Palace.There are some interesting things to see here. The Vladislav Hall is an enormous banqueting hall which was large enough to stage tournaments on horseback. When it is used for events to-day it takes 2 days to heat it! For students of European history one of the most interesting features is the window from which two Catholic governors were thrown out over the castle walls by Protestant nobleman in 1618 thus precipitating the 30 Years War. (Remarkably they survived!)The gardens on the terraces above Mala Strana are very beautiful but the ones on the moat side are more extensive and quite historic. No one should miss Golden Lane where various craftsmen have worked since the 16th century. Some of the cottages are furnished with period furniture.The changing of the guard occurs every hour but try and see it at midday as the whole band comes along then and sounds a fanfare from the Royal Palace balcony."

It's tough to find a ticket machine in the Castle area; the return ticket precludes that problem. Note: The operators of the Castle should ask ALL Tour Guides for a favor: Don't let your 50 people block the entire aisle in the palace for example. Not everyone wants to wait five minutes to get by while you talk about a single room in Italian or Chinese. In truth this is a problem in the Old City as well; they walk down a street, filling it wall to wall (roadway and both sidewalks) .... not allowing anyone to pass. If you are going in the opposite direction, the people in the group are very surly that you are walking through their mob.

The day we visited coincided with the one day of the year (May 17) that the state rooms within the castle are open to the public and entry is free (but you will be queueing for a minimum of 30 minutes. The Ticket for entry into the remainder of the castle and churches at CZK 350 is good value. Also the additional charge of CZK 150 to climb the 287 steps up church bell tower to get the stunning all round views of Prague is well worth it."

The rest of the castle wasn't as interesting. We did the B tour route and felt that covered all the highlights. You'll get a ticket which is scanned at each section when you go through the turnstiles. They also ran out of audio guides, so we got stuck self touring.

We stayed in Prague for 2 and a half months, and after seeing just about all of prague and it's areas, we still think this area is the best overall! Not much more to say about it other than 5 stars! Please go see this area, it is a must!"

It was quite a hike, but really beautiful. It was already somewhat crowded when we arrived around 9 am, but we didn't have to wait too long to buy tickets or to enter any of the buildings on site. There are several different things to see inside the complex, and you can buy different ticket packages depending on what you'd like to see. We paid to go inside St. Vitus, the Old Royal Palace, St. George's Basilica, the Golden Lane, and the Daliborka Tower. St. Vitus was amazing and almost overwhelming in its history and decoration. The Old Royal Palace has a grand feasting room and then some much smaller rooms to the side - it was not what I expected a palace to be, but quite a bit of it is closed to the public. I was blown away by St. George's Basilica - it's not very spectacular (especially if you've just been inside St. Vitus), but it has an ancient, Old-World charm that is just fascinating. The Golden Lane was very fun to explore - it's comprised of a row of apartments, and each one is decorated to portray the lives of former residents (both real, like Franz Kafka, and fictional). The final stop for our trip to the complex was the Daliborka Tower - it had medieval restraints and torture devices on display, so if that's your cup of tea then be sure to check it out."

You really can't go into any of the buildings except the church (as best I could tell and I took a guided tour). Also, it doesn't look like a castle at all by most people's estimations. Just more like a prettier version of most of the buildings in Prague. So I think how much you'll like it will depend on your expectations. (I actually had another group of tourists standing three feet from the gate ask me where the castle was! They were positive this couldn't possibly be the thing called the \"castle.\") With that said, I have been to this area multiple times, because it provides a fabulous view of the city! The stairway down the back is lovely. The rooftop views are quite nice. I've seen couples doing wedding photos there. It is a long way up from the old town. Take the tram (line 22 goes up). Or a taxi (10 Euros in my experience). I went up multiple times at different times of day just to catch the light and do photography. I recommend a taxi (if you're traveling alone) if you're going really early or late (sunrise or sunset) because it's pretty desolate then."

There are many beautiful, intricate and stunning castles in Europe and while the Cast District in Prague certain fits all of those descriptors it is also one of the most poorly run and heavily monetized. I don't mind paying to see parts of the castle, quite the contrary, I enjoy knowing that my funds will help preserve history for others to see. What is frustrating is when you have to buy multiple, rather expensive tickets, to see everything within the same complex. For example, some of the castle is available on one ticket, other parts of the castle and the cathedral on another. And if you want to climb the tower? Well a third ticket is now in your future. The view from the top of the tower is lovely, but I would suggest the tower atop the hill next to the monastery instead as it gives you a higher, more unobstructed view of the city. While beautiful there are better castles in Europe to see and nice places in Prague to visit."

Make sure you have at least one day at your disposal to visit at ease the Castle District as, according to the Guinness Book of World Records, Prague Castle is the largest ancient castle complex in the world - http://web.archive.org/web/20060721043205/http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/content_pages/record.asp?recordid=50103 (I did not even know that).Start with the 12 o`clock changing of the guards at the castle`s main entrance and then proceed to discover its second and third courtyards. Make sure not to miss a visit inside St.Vitus\u00b4s Cathedral, St. George Basilica, the world-famous Golden Lane and the Royal Gardens. The towers are not a too spectacular site unless you are interested in the Castle Guard`s history (Mihulka Tower) or torture instruments (Daliborka Tower). Then go and visit the Royal Garden with its magnificent palace called Belvedere and the Singing Fountain in front of it. Last but not the least take a walk into the most quiet corner of the Castle District, the Novy Svet street (or The New World - narrow street with small houses where the owners used to put house signs above the door to identify their houses, which you can still see there), and make sure to get to Loreta on the hour to hear the famous chime of the bells in the tower."

They keep so serious and people smile beam make faces and photograph. We were so luck to see the change of the Guards and a Guard March exit the Castle with their Rifles and march in harmony. Outside the Castle quarters are two people dressed up as a Jester and a King. They have a Seat and a Big heart so people can sit and have 4 photos taken with these actors and if anything you shall crack up laughing as they get you to do the various poses. On exiting the Castle to the left you will be blown away with the fantastic panoramic view of Prague. Don't forget the camera. There is also a man there with vintage cars of which you can hire for 50 euro . This entails him taking you to see all the sights and attractions of Prague where they stop so photographs may be taken. great quick way to get around. I say this not that I took the car as I prefer to walk. But if one decided to walk down to the Charles bridge from the Castle quarters there are many steps to go down and may not be suitable for everyone. A taxi, Bus . The funicular is there to use also to go up the inclined plane of the hill to the castle. Great system for everyone to access Castle quarters. You can drink some nice soft drinks or hot wine a favourite of people to warm them in the winter autumn visiting months. On reaching the bottom of the steps down there are little cafes on the right hand side of the steps the first one as in nearest was run by a family. simple local foods hot and cold available. Very quaint place. lovely little rooms and quirky things to snap shot. Enjoy this visit . I sure did."

As we were only in Prague for a few days, we had decided to see all the free things first! Next we visited the Toy Shop but didn't stay long as we found that this didn't really interest us as much. There is a bronze statue of a naked male in a plinth outside the shop. It is said to be lucky if you rub his private part! Obviously this is now the shinnest part of the statue! We went into the palace museum cafe for a drink and something to eat! The food and drink is good but you do pay a little more; as we found when we pass a smaller cafe on the way down! However, as the cafe is all part of the palace museum, they also had a gift shop to wander round and also some interesting pictures!You can take some great photos at the top!The walk down is not too steep and there are some souvenir stalls on the at down.Don't miss this experience if you have the time!"

For example I did not know, who St Nepomuk was but learned everything about his silver sakropharg in the cathdral. Where the silver was found, who paid it an why it was placed there.  By the way: Catholics see John of Nepomuk as a martyr to the cause of defending the Seal of the Confessional, romantic nationalists regard him as a Czech martyr to imperial interference, and most historians present him as a victim of a late version of the inveterate investiture controversy between secular rulers and the Catholic hierarchy. He was imprisoned, tortured and thrown into the river on command of the King Wenzel IV. (see the place on Karl\u00b4s Bridge). He is THE national hero."

Tickets are valid for two days so you can explore all the attractions. They charge 50cz for taking pictures, I do not think this is nice assuming it is a touristic area. Access is easy from the city center."

If you're coming from Mala Strana (Lesser Quarter) to the south, the Castle sits atop the hill in Hradcany and is only accessible via a flight of stairs on Zamecke Schody that vears off of Thunovska near St.Nicolas Church in Malostranske namesti (the main town square in the Lesser Quarter). Using google maps to find these streets will prove helpful if you're planning your own walking tour like we did. If you're coming from the north, the entrance is easier to find, but most visitors come from the south via Old Town into the Lesser Quarter before climbing up to the Castle, which makes the first route a more likely option. Prague Castle is actually a complex (the largest ancient castle in the world) housing the St.Vitus Cathedral, St.George Basilica, the Old Royal Palace (home of the Czech President), and various gardens, so don't expect a stereotypical castle with wooden torches and hidden passages, just merely a set of walls containing a bunch of buildings. Still worth a visit nonetheless, even if solely for a great view of the city below. The grounds are free and open until 11 pm, but the individual buildings are closed starting at 4 pm.Another note: Tram 22 to Prazsky Hrad or Metro Line A (green) to Malostranske followed by a short walk up the hill are the 2 easiest ways to arrive in this district."

The Vladislav Hall is a huge hall over 60 metres long with an impressive rib-vaulted ceiling and you can imagine the coronations, banquets which have taken place over the years. It was even used for jousting tournaments and there is a 'riders staircase' with nine shallow steps so the Knights could ride into the hall ready for their tournament. There are panoramic views across Prague as you walk down the Golden Lane which dates from the 15th Century and has a beautiful, olden world quaintness about it."

The monastery and vineyard are excellent. There is a brewery in the monastery where you can order food in lovely surroundings and buy their very own un-pasteurised beer. It changed daily dependant on what was brewed. I did notice a table full of American young travellers (who were far too loud and screechy and everything was oh so fingers down a chalk board-ingly \u2018awesome\u2019- oh God!!!! Must everything be ruined, it\u2019s a monastery, why send a me a herd of loud Americans? Why? why?????) Anyway (anyway\u2019s?) They all chose pints of un-pasteurised beer (which is really neat). I couldn\u2019t help thinking that in the USA beer is often advertised as triple filtered. I felt a warm glow of satisfaction knowing that most of that gang would wake next morning with the screaming ab dabs and nothing, nothing would be awesome anymore. So yes, go there (unless of course your name is Tyler or Brad and everything is awesome) and enjoy the spectacular scenery and food and drink and general ambience and the peace and quiet.

We visited the Church of Our Lady Victorious on the way, dating back to the 16th century run by the Carmelite order, which houses the famous Infant Child of Prague - well worth seeing. Prague castle, seat of the Czech president, is an interesting collection of buildings including the amazing gothic St Vitus Cathedral, dating back to 1300s. Some glorious classical music could be heard from one or two of the churches. There are several palaces to see including Lobkowicz Palace, whose museum holds some Beethoven and Mozart manuscripts. The changing of the guard took place while we were there, but it was quite a simple small event. As we later made our way down the hill towards Charles Bridge with its Baroque statues standing proud, snow was falling and the twinkling lights of the city created a magical unforgettable scene.

I recommend a visit/ tour of Lobkowicz Palace further down the hill but you need to purchase a separate entrance ticket. & after walking for 4 hours allow enough time before closing.

So we were able to come back on the Second morning and finish off some of the ticketed attractions. Even so the crowds were up early and there were still queues. Perhaps not so long. What we did enjoy about coming back in the morning was that the light was different and much easier to get photos of the City.

We have done it in the spring, summer, fall and winter and can't get enough off the ever changing views of the city. We do not go on the tours, but stop in the Cathedral, catch a concert in the Basilica and stop in the Lobkowitz Palace for a bite to eat and of course the view.The changing off the Castle Guards at noon was something we never saw in Prague before.

The views of the city from here are stunning, very many photo points too. Amongst the Royal route, the castle district seems to be tucked away and forgotten by time. Conveniently not forgotten by tourists though. The place seems to be teeming but doesn't give you the crowded feel. Ensure you taste the hot wine from the many stalls avail through out. Based on the advice of fellow TA contributors, we didn't buy tickets for the tour and I think the decision was sound and the advice good. You can either take a bus from the city center to the top of the hill (forgot the no, was informed by our hotel staff) and walk down or vice versa or walk both ways (which may be a bit cumbersome for the elderly and challenged). We followed the offline TA map for various attractions in this part of the city and honestly didn't miss much coz the map also gives a brief intro of the place. We witnessed the Guard changing ceremony at 13:00 at the palace gates, nothing royal but was good. Not sure if this is an hourly thing or once a day. If possible, try to time your visit to the top of the hill by 13:00 to catch this event.In all, would suggest to include Hradcany into your itinerary."

Start with the information/ticket office. There is a maze of combination tickets to the numerous individual sights up there, but absolutely no signage or brochure which explains it. Instead, you get to wait behind a line of customers only allowed an explanation and negotiation of the maze when they get to the one person selling tickets. They even have the gaul to charge you for a simple map of the grounds. In our case, we only wanted to see St Vitus cathedral. \"Oh that's free, you don't need a ticket.\" Great. We find the cathedral and discover that we are restricted to a penned area at the very back of the church. To see the aisles and the alter you need a ticket! Then we thought we'd check out the shops on the Golden Road, which we enjoyed on our last visit several years ago. Well now you need a ticket. \"But it will be free in half an hour at 4:00\" We offer to buy a ticket. \"No, it's too late to buy tickets.\" We sip coffee for half an hour. We go in and what was once a row of unique specialty stores is now a row of the same cheap garbage as 90% of the Christmas Market booths. We'd had enough, so we followed the exit sign behind long row of tourists down a very narrow covered stairway. At the exit gate, a hostile thug yelled at everyone to go back, they were locking the gate! Back we went to a gate marked \"No Exit\" to finally get our. Kafka's work suddenly became abundantly clear. I'm a Prague resident now, but I will never go anywhere near this place again.

While we were there, the St. Vitus Cathedral was closed, so we did not opt to spend the money (250-350 czk) on the tours inside of the castle. I would recommend the walk from the Castle down to and across Charles Bridge (just follow the crowd!)."

Instead, there was a lot of the usual things you would see in a Baroque palace: a stunning ceiling mural, ancient wooden doors with impressive iron and brass locks and hinges, some beautiful 18th century furniture.

You were doing your outmost to make us enjoy the tour and you suceeded. First we were received down town in a very sweet andnice way. I am sure that all five of us felt very welcomed. When you gave us the history of Prague, you really proved to us that your knowledge was very impressing. The information was given in a very fluent English so we all could understand. We also enjoyed our stay atthe Castle-area. First of all it was a great pleasure to listen to your guiding, but I even enjoyed our lunch and chatting more. Luckily you choose goulash from the menu with a wonderful bottle of white wine. The goulash was very delicious and tasted very good. This was myvery first time to have goulash for lunch. I felt that our lunch couldhave lasted longer, but understood that we had to proceed to The Astronomical Clock.To see The Astronomical Clock was also fantastic. This was the last tourist spot on our trip.I want to thank you very much for being so friendly and helpful also when you understood we were looking for a place to buy crystal. Both Jan and I did shopping to our families and they were very happy when they received our gifts.As last, I just want to tell you that we had a fantastic day thanks tothe excellent job you did.

I am sure that I will join you on another tour next time in Prague and will recommend your tours to others. 16th November 2014. Arne Magne Tj\u00e5land"

The entire area is very large and the gardens must be wonderful in Summer. Unless you are very fit take a taxi or tram up to the Castle area and walk down."

We chose the reduced option and visited the Cathedral first. There is virtually no printed material in the building to help you understand what you are seeing. So take a detailed guide book or pay for the audio guide. Alas we had neither. As you would expect it's a fine building, but the stained glass windows are extraordinarily beautiful. There's not much more help in the Old Royal Palace but there's more in the simple and very beautiful Basilica. The main thing is: use a good guide book or the audio guide."

However, once we had the tickets, we had a great day. Although you can wander the grounds of the Castle for free, we bought the tickets so we could see all of St Vitus, St George's Basilica and the Golden Lane.I have seen many churches in Europe, but St Vitus must rank in the top 5. Despite being crowded, we were able to enjoy the entire church. St George's Basilica is a small church, well worth seeing.Despite all of my research before our vacation, I was not aware of all the Golden Lane had to offer. It is filled with old weapons, torture equipment and armor and helmets. Not just a few, but hundreds of various shapes and designs. This was a highlight for me.We also saw the changing of the guard---but due to the crowds, it was hard to see everything.Overall, a wonderful experience--do not miss it, it is one of the major highlights in Prague and well worth the price of the tickets"

It's cute, yes, but I was turned off by the fact that you had to purchase entry (part of a cumulative ticket). We paid extra for the gardens, which was worth it as they were beautiful. However, I don't think I would do that in the winter. A place that not very many people seem to have seen are the Royal Gardens outside of the castle, in the Hradcany neighborhood.

It's popular, so get there early to stake out a good spot. Warning: individual tickets aren't sold to a number of attractions, such as Golden Lane, and must be purchased as a package."

However, given the vast area, it's still possible to find pockets of peace and quiet I chanced upon a garden off the entrance near the guard house, which had flowers in full bloom and a space where several falcons were being tended. Opposite the said garden was a small cafe below a souvenir shop which carried high end Czech art pieces.I suggest walking around the area to bask in the signifcance of the castle and its surroundings."

There are also some fun cafes within the castle walls to enjoy and break up the trip...however, make sure you take tons of pictures of the castle first!"

We were there not during a peak time, but the crowds built over the day. You have the option to pay for shorter or longer tours of the buildings, take the longer as you will want to see everything. We really recommend beginning with the Castle Story tour as you will go down to the original foundations of the castle and see the complete history of its life and people who inhabited it. The St Vitus Cathedral and Vitus Treasury are other attractions that we enjoyed. The treasures are quite astounding as to workmanship and priceless values of the artifacts. The Golden Lane was not so interesting and was just a vendor's opportunity to get you to buy souvenirs. There are a few places in to buy ice cream, drinks and food in the courtyards. Lots of cobblestones so need to wear your good walking shoes. We didn't get to explore the castle gardens but they are supposed to be very beautiful."

There were a couple dead end streets, especially the one with the ancient minature store fronts.

The grounds are impressive.

The cathedral was beautiful but you could see the majority of it without paying for entrance. The Royal Palace was largely unfurnished so there was little to do in there without a guide. I thought Golden Lane was quite a ripoff - it's interesting to look at I guess, but I resent paying to enter a street that is just full of shops. All in all, I would recommend just walking around outside or paying for a guide. We only spent about 25 minutes walking through everything. The views are beautiful though - and free!"

No wonder Unesco included it in its patrimony, the Castle District is full of towers, buildings, gardens, statues and above all, the St Vitus Cathedral. What I don't like about it is the ticketing they are having for it. They ask for a separate ticket for about any building in there. You even need a ticket in order to walk on the Golden Lane. You can buy a combination ticket, but I didn't find one that covers everything, so most likely you will need to buy more than one combination ticket in order to get everything. Each building has a number written at the entry that you can also find on the map behind the ticket, but there aren't directions to guide you to that. You can walk a little in St Vitus for free, but the complete tour requires a ticket. There is a free garden at the entry of the Castle District, but there are others that require a ticket.There is a changing guards parade that you can watch if you want. The combination ticket is available for two days, but the place is big and can get awfully crowded so expect to use those two days if you want to thoroughly visit the buildings. Otherwise, it is better to choose just a couple of buildings and then have a short walk on the free garden before leaving if you don't want to spend too much time in there (or you are not willing to come back the following day). The Castle District is located somewhere up the hill so, if you want to walk there (as I did), there are a lot of stairs. You may want to consider that before thinking about going up and down more than one time (I did that for three times or so and it is tiring)."

When walking round the castle DONT buy a ticket to walk inside the church - you can go inside without a ticket, you can take pictures and enjoy the place but you can't walk down the nave end - big deal - save yourself a few bob!It's very hilly but this will give you fantastic views across Prague.I suggest you get a tram to the castle and walk round and down rather than start at the bottom and walk up, much easier on the feet!Very pretty area and worth a visit but not on top of my list to go back to."

Follow the signs on a short walk to the beautiful castle gardens. Stroll through these spectacular gardens to the back entrance to the castle. Once inside, if you see a flag atop the building, it means the President is in his offices. The castle grounds are huge, with many buildings dating back to the 15th century and some much further back in history, entry to St. Vitus cathedral is free, and it is often jammed with tourists. Quite fabulous, inside and out. Don't miss golden street on the Castle's outer wall, to see the tiny homes occupied by the poorer residents. Allow several hours to visit inside the castle walls, and more in the historic squares and lookouts over Prague outside its walls. Take a grand downhill stroll from the Castle to Mala Strana, with it's many embassies, the Lenon Memorial Wall, and end up at Charles Bridge. A great way to spend a day in Prague.Peter and GayeVictoria, B.C., Canada"

There are jewels, and wonderful medieval rooms. The art gallery had a very interesting collection of paintings. While a pain to go in and out of (crowded and tiny), the Golden Lane offers a glimpse into the workers lives. The multiple palaces are neat (especially to Americans like us, who don't have castles back home).Older visitors, or individuals with physical challenges may struggle getting up to the complex, and around and in and out of the buildings. We took the tram up, then walked. We found a wonderful cafe that overlooked Prague (up in one of the buildings), so there are alternatives to the mediocre snack/sandwiches at the stands (just take time to look and find them).Give yourself most of a day - it's worth it."

There are lots of free areas to wander and fabulous views across Prague from the castle's prominent hill top location. To fully explore the area you will need to buy a 5 part ticket which lets you into extra parts of the Cathedral, Royal Palace, Chapel, Powder Tower & Golden Lane.

To appreciate fully the charms and secrets of this fabulous neighbourhood, take this path. generally, pilgrims to Prague first pay homage to Prague Castle, but those in the know and savvy with the 'local -goodies', recommend the neighbourhood behind the castle, as it is a treasure-trove of monumental palaces and towering churches interspersed with souvenir shops,eateries and excellent cafes. We walked along the main artery of the district finding winding passages, narrow stairways and walled streets veering off to the left and right. The tram stop, (Pohorelec), is an excellent place to start,as we alighted from the tram, watched over by the imposing statues of astronomers.  Up next is Strahov Monastery with amazing murals and friezes. The libraries a treat visually for bibliotechs like my femme, but i rather fancied the gorgeous ceiling frescoes. It was time to feed the ravenous stomachs, so we grazed at Klasterni Pivovar Strahov, where we sampled some lovely grub with a dark, heady brew of ale. Exit, and stage a left fork past the Emperor's ambassador's pile and onto the magnificent Loreto, the most amazing religious building in Prague. Its a baroque fantasy. But then, is there any other? Its has eye-popping treasures and a macabre style. On and on we trooped, dizzy with our finds. \"Onto the castle!!\", said my passionate femme with resolute imperiousness to her intonation. Palaces by the bucket-load followed.... Sternberg, Tuscan, Martinic, the Archbishops and Swanzenberg with the best Renaissance facade, now a military museum. Now it was my turn to claim visiting imperiousness. We split here. I to the museum, she to the Archbishop'. What a fabulous district."

We didn't even buy a ticket for anything because we chose to attend the cathedral's mass (for free)--again, less crowds and great unobstructed pictures afterwards.

Yes there are typical tourist stores along the way, but they are within historic buildings, so they don\u2019t stand out. Avoid the mini marts as they are overpriced. There are a couple ways to get up to the castle, so we walked up the hill, and took the stairs on the other side down (which was nice as we walked past an apartment that Alfons Mucha had stayed at). There is also a way to walk along the old moat (which is now dry). It was interesting as saw the small area where there used to keep bears (which was given as a presidential gift). There are great views from the top, and a lot of quaint little side streets along the way. The castle and the cathedral at the top are beautiful so give yourself plenty of time to see everything and just wander around!"

If you travel a lot to Europe you may have seen many places like this (only the Czech one is much larger).If you are in Prague - go visit this place, but don't give it more than a couple of hours. We didn't like the fact that almost every building required a fee for entrance. It gave us a feeling of a tourist's trap.Near the bottom of the slope there's a place selling cold drinks with royal chocolate. We recommend the ice coffee with royal chocolate. Here is a well known tip that we think worth a repost: most people do a big mistake and get off tram no. 22 at Pra\u017esk\u00fd hrad. If you do that, you need to walk up a very steep incline. Don't do that. Keep on with the tram and get off at Poho\u0159elec."

Also in the castle district you can see (with the same ticket) the St. Vitus cathedral (which you shouldnt miss), the golden lane (very nice) and a variety of museums. Have in mind that there are different entrances to get in the castle. We took the metro, stopped to malostranska, climbed some stairs and then got in the castle- but it was a little confusing and we didnt know from which side to go and start our visit. It is much better to take the tram22 - you will avoid the steps and you wont be confused because the route is easier from that side."

The Castle District (Hradcany) comprising of the Prague Castle complex, the various streets and lanes surrounding the castle and leading down to the Little Quarter (Mala Strana), is in my opinion overwhelmingly beautiful. And overwhelming in a wonderful way. It's true that the Prague Castle complex is one of the largest castle complexes in the world, though at the same time the various palaces and buildings in the castle complex are beautifully well-maintained. St. Vitus Cathedral is indeed grand and massive, though impressively beautiful at the same time, with a great historical significance (the country's patron saint, St. Wenceslas, is buried in the cathedral).The various streets and lanes surrounding the castle are quite beautiful and charming, and a few side streets and lanes near the Presidential Palace are quite quaint and charming. And when you walk to the area near the Strahov Monastery you're rewarded with wonderful views of St. Vitus Cathedral and the Prague Castle complex, along with stunning views of the Little Quarter, and the Old Town out in the distance. From the area near the Strahov Monastery you can then walk down to Nerudova Street, which leads you into the beautiful area of the Little Quarter.Because this district is so impressively beautiful and historically significant, you'll have many, many people visiting this area. Since I had a total of 9 days in Prague, I was able to visit the Castle District twice. The first time I hired a local guide, who walked me through not only the Castle Complex, but my guide also treated me to a few of the side streets and lanes near the Presidential Palace, and I found these side streets to be very charming. I feel I would not have found these various side streets and lanes on my own, I felt hiring a local guide to walk me around the Castle Complex and the Castle District was absolutely worthwhile. On the second time I visited the Castle complex and Castle District I was able to take my time in visiting the Cathedral and other spots at the Castle complex.I felt the first time I visited the Castle District I got so much out of visiting the district with a local guide. I feel hiring a good local guide makes a huge difference in visiting the Castle District. And I felt once I learned the significance of the Castle District, and the important points of interests of the Castle District from the local guide I hired, I was able to visit some of those same points of interests in more detail on my second visit to the Castle District.Whether you visit the Castle District with a local guide, whether you explore the Castle District on your own, or (as in my case) you do both, the bottom line is your visit to the Castle District, your time in the Castle District, will be an absolutely wonderful and memorable experience."

The Prague Castle was a disappointment as there were a lot fo areas not open to the public due to some renovations going on. Unlike other castles we saw in Europe, this was a let-down. The church of St. George, the Dragon-slayer, was also a disappointment becasue it was not so well-preserved.

In both cases we arrived in the western square/gate in the mid morning. For the first visit, the lovely bride and I walked up from the hotel near the bridge. For the second time with the in-laws, we took the tram. The walk up is a bit steep so the tram is a good idea. If you time it right, you can see the changing of the guard. Try to watch from the small inner square. You'll see the band playing from the windows. We suggest buying the 4 site pass - Circuit B. That includes St. Vitus Cathedral, Old Royal Palace, St. George's Basilica, Golden Lane with Daliborka Tower. That seemed to work well for us. About half way through we ended up having lunch at the little cafe on the north side. It's fine and reasonably priced. We finished around 4:00 which was just enough time to walk back to our hotel (Pod Vezi) for a nap before dinner. Definitely worth a visit."

Actually, the castle itself is enormous and well worth seeing. About fifty meters from the castle entrance is the national art gallery, which has a nice collection. There were maybe four other people aside from us in the gallery. A little ways from the castle is the Loreto church, which has a replica of \"St Mary's House\" on its grounds and a nice display of religious \"treasure.\" You can also tour the Strahov Monastery and art gallery. The monastery makes and sells its own beer. There's also Novy Svet (New Street) of very picturesque houses. All of these places were practically deserted compared to the tourist throngs in Old Town."

The history of the castle stretches back to the year 870 with the construction of its first walled building, the Church of the Virgin Mary. The Basilica of Saint George and the Basilica of St. Vitus were founded under the reign of Vratislav and his son St. Wenceslas in the first half of the 10th century.The first convent in Bohemia was founded in the castle, next to the church of St. George. A Romanesque palace was erected here during the 12th century. In the 14th century, under the reign of Charles IV the royal palace was rebuilt in Gothic style and the castle fortifications were strengthened. In place of rotunda and basilica of St. Vitus began building of a vast Gothic church, that have been completed almost six centuries later.During the Hussite Wars and the following decades, the castle was not inhabited. In 1485, King Ladislaus II Jagello began to rebuild the castle. The massive Vladislav Hall (built by Benedikt Rejt) was added to the Royal Palace. New defence towers were also built on the north side of the castle.A large fire in 1541 destroyed large parts of the castle. Under the Habsburgs, some new buildings in renaissance style were added. Ferdinand I built Belvedere as a summer palace for his wife Anne. Rudolph II used Prague Castle as his main residence. He founded the northern wing of the palace, with the Spanish Hall, where his precious art collections were exhibited.The Second Prague defenestration in 1618 began the Bohemian Revolt. During the subsequent wars, the Castle was damaged and dilapidated. Many works from the collection of Rudolph II were looted by Swedes in 1648, in the Battle of Prague (1648) which was the final act of the Thirty Years' War.The last major rebuilding of the castle was carried out by Empress Maria Theresa in the second half of the 18th century. Following his abdication in 1848, and the succession of his nephew, Franz Joseph, to the throne, the former emperor, Ferdinand I, made Prague Castle his home.In 1918, the castle became the seat of the president of the new Czechoslovak Republic."

The changing of the guard is as impressive as that in Monaco, neither being anything to write home about. The view from the lookout is panoramic and impressive. The trams are an excellent means of accessing the heights, the area is definitely not for those with limited mobility. The previously monastic brewery makes and sells some very good beers,this is just near the white church with two towers visible from the bridge. A visit here could quite easily cover multiple days to view all areas. It is essential to be aware that you are at the mercy of the weather in between each site so a hat, sunscreen or maybe umbrella are suggested. You could wander this very large district and not spend a crown if you didn't want to and still have a great visit. The view is, again, rather special but...watch your step."

Not the best idea: the powder tower was just a display of military uniforms; the Story of a Prague was mostly text; the old Castle was big empty rooms with the exception of a small bookshelf over a doorway with beautifully bound tax records and even the Rosenberg palace was a bit dry. The Golden Lane was a bunch of tacky gift shops that was actually a ticketed site! However, St. Vitus was wonderful and the ticket allows you to see much more than just the free part. The gardens are free and lovely as is the noontime changing of the guard and the views. So, listen to the travelers and save your money.The Toy Museum is an extra charge but there is no sign about tickets at the bottom of the 3 flight you have to walk up before you find out.Also...take the 22 tram to the Cadtle and walk down."

My recommendation for a pleasant walking tour would be:Take tram no.22 to Kralovsky letohradek station (one stop before Prazsky hrad), enter the Royal Garden's gate opposite to the tram station and follow this itinerary: Royal Summer Palace (where the building ends: very special view of Prague and the Castle!), walk through the Garden toward its main entrance, turn left, visit the Castle (just walking around is for free), St. Vitus Cathedral and exit the Castle building complex on the front exit at Hradcanske namesti (Renaissance palaces!). Continue on Loretanska street, turn left to reach Loreta church (admire it from outside or get a ticket and visit the place). After a short walk on Cerninska street you turn right and continue on the romantic Novy Svet (New World) street. The Kanovnicka street will lead you back to Hradcanske namesti Square.One of the most pitoresque stairs of Prague, Radnicke schody (Town Hall Stairs, near Restaurant Ve Stari Radnici, Loretanska 1) will take you to Nerudova street (In this steep street you can find many restaurants, souvenir shops, embassies, but what\u2019s most remarkable about this street are the house signs and the people that lived in that houses. Why house signs? The house numbers were introduced in Prague in 1770. Before that the houses were recognized by their signs and Nerudova street has a vast collection of them: no. 49, 43, 41, 34, 32, 12, 6)At the end of Nerudova street is Church of St. Nicholas (Malostranske namesti Square) and after a 3 minute walk you find yourself on the Charles Bridge! Admire the statues, the view, and stop for a while to listen the street (bridge?) musicians playing genuine Dixiland made in Prague...(Estimated total length of this tour: 5 km)"

Our visit to the castle was interesting but of everything we did during our 6 days in Prague, if I had to eliminate anything due to time constraints, I would now delete our visit to the castle. It was extremely busy and took a great deal of time. There were many large group tours going on in the castle area and this always reduces the amount of enjoyment we experience. My wife and I both agreed after our self directed tour, that we would not recommend this to anyone unless they were really into castles."

I went up all the way to the top of the tower (for a fee of course) but i must admit that it was worth it. Views from the top were just as amazing. The church next to the castle was absolutely beautiful. We just stood in the middle and admired the detail. The church does have an entrance fee should you wish to walk around."

St. Vitus is the largest and most impressive. The original castle (as in the battlement walls) has been converted into the Palace over time. So go on the tour of the Palace to see the remaining castle. We also enjoyed Golden Lane because there is a section with a fascinating display of medieval armor, torture chamber and weapons. This section is kinda hidden, look upstairs across from the cafe. The wooden craft shops are also charming. And the walk uphill to the view is outstanding. After a long walk and tour we had an excellent late lunch at U Labuti. Its located at Hradcanske namEsti 11 about 1 block down from the changing of the guard. After some heavy Czech meals, the salads were extremely fresh and delicious. Together with some excellent soup and Czech wine it was an excellent meal that recharged us for the long walk back."

We exited through the side and crossed the Deer Moat which led us to a park trail that runs across from the Castle grounds to the Metronome (another landmark in the Prague skyline which used to hold a statue of Stalin and has since been replaced). There is a marvelous view of the castle complex as you walk away with a stunning vistas of the cathedral and castle if you venture out this less traveled exit.The sun was going down and we stopped at various points just to gaze at the city in the golden glow of the setting sun. There were very few tourists, mostly residents walking their dogs or taking a leisurely stroll before heading home. The light, the views, the distance from the tourist mobs that seemed to hound us wherever we went made this moment my favorite time in Prague.

The complex is LARGE, so be sure you are ready to walk. The views of the city are spectacular.A few drawbacks: We were with a small tour group, and had the ticket with four of the areas included. We knew we were going to stay longer, because we wanted to go to the treasury, and spend more time in the little shops. We learned that once you exit the area where the small shops are, you cannot walk back up there without getting another ticket!! Which required going back to the ticket office nearly half way back to the entrance! Poor customer relations. I have money that I want to spend in those little shops and you won;t let me walk back the 40 yards uphill to look in all of them again...really? So, if you are with a group and you want to stay longer then they do, do not exit out of the narrow lane of shops to meet them down at the statue of the young boy (a popular place for a tour guide to say to meet at the end of the tour), or you will have to get a new ticket to get back to those cute little shops! Also the treasury requires a separate ticket.Also, there are nice cafes to eat in for lunch or a snack, whichever your preference. There are ice cream bars, desserts, sodas water, chips and such in the cafe by the statue of the young boy, There is a very nice gift shop there as well. When departing, the exit straight down from the castle is quite steep and has MANY small long steps. i wish we had not gone this way...but we did not know where we would exit if we took the garden route, which is over the the right of the lookout when you exit.

If you are planning on walking to the castle from the Charles Bridge, it is a long uphill climb. The outside of the castle is beautiful and I was happy to have a guide to bring the history of the city to life for us. It was very busy and honestly, we didn't see much of the inside of the castle at all, very disappointing. The Golden Lane area was very interesting but again very crowded. It took us a long time to exit as there is only one narrow doorway through which the crowd of people have to go through one at a time. I personally enjoyed the Jewish Quarter and Old Town more."

Although is isn't really a castle there is a lot of history linked to the cathedral and the surrounding palaces and churches. Well worth the visit, take time to read the information or listen to the guide if you take the tour. There is no fee to enter the precinct, however you need to pay if you enter any of the buildings.Changing of the guard is worth watching, not quite the sharpness of the guard at Buckingham Palace however very entertaining and colourful.

If you have been to other historic palaces then you may find this one slightly disappointing so buying the ticket may not be worth it and with many of the buildings, the ticket does not offer significantly enough over what you can see for free to justify it.One must visit inside the castle district is the Golden Lane - especially the free to visit weaponry museum located at the entrance to the lane. You will find some very interesting and creative weaponry there and this place was certainly the highlight of my visit to the castle area."

She pretended to be pushing in to the line and as she pushed she was actually opening my bag. Luckily I cottoned on and slapped her hand away before she took off but this could have ended rather badly. The toilet attendant was looking as this happened and did nothing (She may not have realised what was going on) but this did make me a bit suspicious."

There are some amazing historical monuments, some trying too hard, some too touristy and some just less interesting. It really half great, half OK. To visit here or anywhere in Prague in summer, you must really have the patience and energy to deal with the crowds followed by the usually super rude-curt front line staff in ticket offices, restaurants,shops etc. There is so much to see here that it feels almost exhausting, I would suggest doing it in 2 days but that means you'll have to climb uphill twice (perched on the top). Within almost each attraction, there is a caf\u00e9 or restaurant so you wouldn't need to leave the area for lunch. We did trudge downhill a bit out of the compound thinking it would be better, not much difference really. Like the rest of Prague, you are bombarded with souvenir stores or anything that could be sold to a tourist. It's Day 6 of our 14 day trip in Prague and I am quite sick of the rudeness and curtness. It's the worse in Europe I've encountered (and I travelled widely in France, been to Spain, Italy, Greece, Vienna, London). Most people do not speak English"

It is located just beyond Mala Strana - 'Lesser Quarter' and is the location of Prague Castle and other impressive attractions that you can spend a couple of days visiting during a holiday to Prague. Like Mala Strana, there are many quaint alleyways and passage streets that make this a nice area to simply spend time. However, its the major attractions set this area apart from other districts in the city. Obviously, Prague Castle is the main feature in the area. Here you can visit a handful of interesting attractions, including the Old Royal Palace, Golden Lane, Rosenberg Palace. Within the castle grounds you can also visit St. Vitus Cathedral, This Gothic masterpiece is the biggest and most important church in the country and one of our favourites of this architectural style in all of Europe. Other very good attractions in the Hradcany District include the Strahov Monastery, Loreta Monastery and Treasury and Schwarzenberg Palace amongst others. Predictably, cafes, restaurants and souvenir shops a plenty can be found in this area as well. Hardcany, having an elevated position over the city, affords some very pleasant viewpoints as well. We much enjoy those found at the Strahov Monastery as well as those seen from Prague Castle, particularly the walkway leading to the eastern gate. Overall, we enjoy spending time visiting the attractions of Hradcany District. While we prefer Mala Strana a bit more personally, this is a highly recommendable area of Prague to spend time during visits to the city."

The Castle itself was interesting, but not as elaborate or ornate as I had imagined it would be. The walk around the area is really the best part or the visit because you get an incredible panorama or the landscape, the river, and the whole city.When making your way down on foot, beware, it's a steep incline and my sister fell quite badly.

You can really enjoy all the different styles. I sometimes thought I was in Vienna.Go watch at the Matthias Gate for the changing of the watch. This happens every hour. If you go around noon there is more than 2 guards changing you will see a small army parading and there is even a small band there.

It has a Gothic Style chapel and holds the tombs of several Saints. The Abess of this Church had the right to crown the Bohemian Queens consort.The Golden Lane is an olden lane dating from the 15th century and has an old world charm to it. It contains 11 historical houses, inside which period scenes have been created to show the life of the artisans who lived there.The upper levels of the houses are connected and have a display of medieval armory and textiles.There was a torture chamber, house & workshop of an alchemist, goldsmith, army man, etc."

I suggest taking a guided tour so that you can get some history to go with the historical buildings you will visit. The area is quite hilly, so be sure to have on good walking shoes. It is all cobblestone streets on uneven surfaces, so use caution. You most likely will see wedding couples having their pictures made when in this area, because evidently lots of couples come to Prague to get married and only have a photographer with them to take pictures to show family back home. You can take some great photos of the old town from this hillside location. Be sure you go on a clear day!"

There were very few people around and The St Vitus Cathederal was bathed in sunlight making for great photographic opportunities. A couple of days later the Palace Guard put on a free display in freezing cold weather and I bought a 300kr ticket that gave access to most but not all buildings in this area. The powder room holds an interesting collection of uniforms, history and arms belonging to the Palace Guard and would keep kids amused, there is also a collection of armour in the Golden Lane area which is pretty but busy.To do this area justice you need a day, but if on a tight budget or pushed for time a free stroll round is equally as pleasant. The area is surrounded by some pleasant restaurants and bars, the better ones being further up the hill. For a small additional charge there is nearby toy museum full of Barbie Dolls. Beware of the cafe in this vicinity as refreshments are expensive as it is a tourist trap and I was short changed."

Only the castle itself has narrative in English--and although it is interesting, it was a little bland. We tried to hire a guide when we bought our ticket, but one wasn't available for over an hour. In hindsight, I would have gone on the castle tour with a guide that we met in the square (Keith... from California... wears a green shirt). I think I would have enjoyed it even more with his type of narrative giving lots of interesting facts.Also, be aware that the castle is really a castle (not a palace). It isn't really much to look at inside, but the views from the balconies are worth going in for. St. Vitus Cathedral is gorgeous--worth a visit (again... with a guide). We also went to St. George's Basilica. This was interesting, and we knew that there must some importance, but without any narrative in English we really didn't appreciate what we were looking at until after we had left. Again--you really could use a tour guide. When you arrive, you can buy either a short tour ticket or a long tour ticket. We did the short tour, and I was happy with that. We spend 3-4 hours just doing the short tour, and I was pretty tired of walking by that point. I'm not sure we would have gotten our money's worth of the long tour."

I don't find the place very 'castle like' its more like a town with a moisture of very old buildings from different eras surrounding a cathedral. However it is a beautiful place and the history as why the stale is all so different I'm sure is fascinating (I probably would have found this out on a tour) the changing of the guard was great to watch!

I'm reviewing a cute little cafe we found (Kaficko) in another review too, near Charles bridge area but off the beaten track and not packed with tourists.The whole castle district would do better if they stopped the endless parade of tourist shops from exploding out onto the street but if you ignore them and look at the buildings, exploring down side streets etc. you'll have a nice time.Just be warned, the castle itself is pretty bad! :)"

Walking around the Hradcany, you have an amazing view of the city, along with the chance to see the Royal Guards, the Palace and St. Vitus Cathedral. If you want to see the cute and quaint Golden Lane, you need to purchase a Hradcany tour ticket, which will grant you access to a lot more museums and houses in the area.

This will allow you to walk down through the cobbled square where you get you're first view of St Vitus' Cathedral.

From the bottom there are a lot of steps to climb but the views on the way up are well worth the climb. there is a quicker way if you take a tram to the top but you would miss the nice views and the guards on duty at the front gate.It does get busy so the best time to visit is early morning as it opens about 9.30 in winter. Lots to do there, you could see a lot for free if you do not need to go inside the buildings. You can buy a short ticket or a long ticket, the dfference is about a fiver.The longer ticket gives you the castle history museum and actually it is a large museum and full of good exhibits and it is very well done and you need 45 mins to an hour minimum if you do a quick visit in there. The tickets are valid for two days and you may need one and a half days to see it all. You can only go in each thing once so take your time.Golden lane is great and well worth a visit and you can only get in there with either a short or long ticket.The toy museum is very well done and only costs 70 to go inside.There are some toilets in the castle area but they cost 10 to go inside but they are spotless. We preferred to have a hot wine in a restaurant for 50 and get a free toilet break.You do not get any free maps of the area, you have to buy them.Cafe Galleria is well priced and very friendly and has lovely homemade cakes.The Old Palace is very good, not much information in there though.The treasury is not included in the ticket and it is very expensive so advise you give it a miss.The cathedral tower is also extra.Rosenberg palace is only on the long ticket, it is not a great place and can be done in ten minutes. It does have some interesting gargoyle exhibits though so worth a look if you have the long ticket.They change guards with a parade every day at noon."

St Vitus Cathedral is absolutely a must, in spite of having closed the access to the crypt. The Royal Palace is not a big deal, it is very little what you get to see of it. The Picture Gallery is quite small, one would have hoped to find a bigger collection of paintings; still you can enjoy some Rubens and Reni, and a curious Paulus Roy \"Triple portrait\" made with a grid-based technique more than 300 hundred years ago. St George Basilica is nice, but you can no longer visit the huge collection of art at St Georges's Convent... What happened with those works of Czech art? Forget the Powder Tower, full of military uniforms, and even the Dalibor Tower, a place of torture. Don't buy the full ticket, it is not worth. Just visit the Cathedral and walk around a couple of hours."

Castle, museums, Golden Lanes, cathedrals, changing of guards, all for one convenient and not trivial price...I guess it just felt way too touristy for me. I really liked the surrounding neighborhood more than the castle grounds. The architecture within the castle grounds is a bizarre mixture of gothic, romanesque, oriental, and mid-20th century architecture. You have to go, but be prepared for the tourist treatment. The gardens next to the Castle walls were a delight, with beautiful views of the city."

The guards are so smart and friendly too, if you can get to the front at 12 noon you get treat to a fanfare. You can buy a ticket to some of the castle for 250 or all of it for 350 k. You cannot just go to Golden Lane you have to pay for a ticket. This was a slight disappointment as it was only a few shops and the guide book depicted more. A lovely walk up to the Castle though, Enjoy."

Whatever! But at least they have an audio guide you can purchase and all the signs are in English and Czech so you can figure out what is what. The Golden Lane is just a crammed street filled mostly with overpriced shops and is along the exit, but they act like it is actually an attraction that you paid for, REALLY, that part was not worth it.

You can not buy an entry ticket for a single particular site. Even if you just want to see, say, Zlata Ulicka you have to buy an expensive combination ticket that includes other things. We bought the most expensive ticket for 350 CZK (almost $20) pp. With that we had entry to most buildings and sites that we were interested in and some that we didn't care about and didn't waste the time to go. However, it did not include entry to all sites like somebody else stated in another review. We wanted to visit the Treasury and that was not covered. It would have been another combination ticket. By the way, they do this in other tourism centers in Prague, too. We wanted to see the Jewish Cemetary and found out that the ticket for the Jewish Quarter, which included the cemetary, was 300 CZK..."

A good tip was to buy tickets the day before, we received quite a good discount so chose chairs rather than the pews!"

Even if you are descending from the castle towards the Charles Bridge, try going a bit right of the castle steps to one of the steep streets.

I believe you may be able to get an official guide at the castle, but I'm not sure.The walk is fairly steep, but shouldn't be too much of a problem if you can walk freely. There are shops and cafes on the way if you need to pause.The castle has 3 courtyards, each with it's own bit of history (get your guide!). The third courtyard contains the impressive St Vitas Cathedral. You can enter one end free, but armed with your audio guide you'll want to pay the small entrance fee and get closer. In particular you can see the many chapels, and the 2 tons of silver that make up the chapel for St John of Nepomuk.Attached to the cathedral is the South Tower. Great views, but be warned it's 287 steps up a circular staircase without any stopping points. You do get a medal as your reward though. Note that entry to this tower is not covered by the \"view everything\" ticket.The Royal palace is also well worth a visit. Again, there is very little information in English, but your guide should tell you exactly which window had bodies hurled through it (the Defenestration of Prague) which led to a long war.Inside the third courtyard you should also visit St George's Basilica.Golden Lane is OK to visit if you purchased the \"view everything\" ticket, but I'm not sure otherwise.We set out early and spent the whole day there, and we didn't even visit the galleries. Shame, as the pictures in my book show the rooms are worth a look all by themselves.Oh, and there are copious gardens to wander through as well.Eating facilities are so-so, but a simple lunch was all we wanted..Be prepared with a guide, pay to enter buildings and you get a full and interesting day at the castle."

I did not visit them this year, because going inside the castle buildings has become pretty expensive and time consuming, not to mention the huge crowds. If your time in Prague is limited, go by all means to the castle, but it's probably not essential that you purchase the 2 day pass (or even the 1 day pass) and view all the interiors included in the passes. I think you would utilize your time better by strolling through the public areas of the castle and visiting less crowded attractions such as St. Nicholas Church, Bethlehem Chapel, or the Old Town Hall. I was at the castle at the end of June and it was jammed packed with visitors. Instead of going through the churches, I paid 80Kc for admission to the Castle Gardens (on the hill between the Castle & Petrin) and there I was practically alone and really enjoyed my walk down, with spectacular views of the city below me at every turn and delightful gazebos, statues, foutains, etc. at practically every step."

It was almost imposible to get a decent photo because of all the people. When the changing of the guard occurred, I thought people would get trampled by the hordes trying to take pictures.We returned that evening after dinner, and what a difference. With very few people around, you could take fantastic photos, including the guard change with no one blocking the view. Also, sunset photos from the castle area are terrific.We liked it so much, we returned the following morning around 8:30 AM and had the place to ourselves. We could take all the pictures we wanted without other people being in the shot. We bought tickets for St. Vitus church at 9 AM when it opened and were the only people in the church for a while. Again, great to take photos.My advice, if you want to get the beauty of the castle district, go very early or in the evening."

We took the tram upto the Strahov Monastery and then made our way down from the monastery to the Castle and St Vitus Cathedral ( use the upper road not the lower road). We visited the St Vitus Cathedral, the castle, went down a steep path to the gardens and sat there for a while, before taking the stairs down to the lower level near the river. Apart from the buildings, the views from the Castle district are excellent. One should take time to enjoy those views."

I've found the less well-known lanes near the Castle to be an antidote to all the bustle. Particularly recommended is a wander along the backstreets around Hradcanske namesti, the large square in front of the main entrance to Prague Castle.Walk along Kanovnicka, which leads off the northwestern corner of the square, and keep going. You'll soon come to Novy svet, a narrow, twisting lane where you feel as if you've been transported back in time. This cosy, intimate part of Hradcany is in striking contrast to the grandeur of the Castle and the adjacent palaces, but no less worth a visit. If you want to ecape the crowds and do some aimless wandering in one of the most evocative corners of old Prague, you should visit this part of Hradcany. But make sure you wear suitable footwear - even by Prague standards, the cobbles are murder!"

Even if you don't take a tour of the castle itself, the castle district is a wonderful place to walk around, explore the grounds, and take in the views. It is evident why they call Prague the \"Golden City\" from up here. We went in the late afternoon and stayed until the sun began to set. It was beautiful the way the afternoon sun shone over the city and the old buildings appeared to glow. The way the castle area is lit up at night is also gorgeous. The grounds are free to wander around. The district is rather large with plenty to see between the castle, cathedral, Golden Lane, great views, etc. I would plan to stay at least a couple of hours even if you don't take a tour of the inside of the castle. Other than the views, one of the best parts of our visit was seeing the Changing of the Guards which takes place every hour on the hour.This is a must-see while in Prague!"

I suggest taking a cab there so you don't wander the many non-straight Prague streets. You'll have plenty of walking once you're there and walk back down. If you find the tram that takes you up/down from the area, that's a good deal since it takes you straight down. The tram cost is about $2 for unlimited hour and a half (only takes koruna change).

We bought the bigger ticket for the sights and paid for the audio too. The audio is very expensive and only can be used for three hours. Beware that you will not see everything in three hours. We went to the castle, cathedral and picture gallery first. Then I ran to return the audioguides because you have to leave a 1000 krona deposit. Unfortunately I then did not have it for everything else. The castle section is very large and if you enter from the front, it goes downhill. I am the ultimate sightseeing person and was totally beat by the end. Maybe you could miss parts of it. I wanted to go to the gardens at the bottom was was too tired.. The view is lovely on the way down and there are some cafes that you could relax at on the way."

You can avoid the hills getting there by taking the trolley, but once there, you will find many steps and ramps. We loved the exercise. The palace itself is awesome. We bought a combo ticket and visited many of the sites within the palace. The basillica of St. George is the oldest structure and you can see the difference between the squared walls and flat ceiling compared to the later vaulted construction. The old palace was pretty stunning. You start at the indoor jousting room, where horses came inside with their riders. Every room is more stunning than the next, and in two of the rooms there is a great display of garnet and crystal. Tip- the prices are very competitive there with outside vendors, and you can be sure of the quality. If you see something you like, buy it. We made the mistake of waiting, then did not find anything comparable in town. Too late for us. Don't make our mistake. Shop around other shops first and you will be in a better position to recognize the high quality craftsmanship and the reasonable prices. The golden lane is an interesting row of dwellings built into the old wall fortifications. It is worth going up into the top section and walking past the armor displays. There is a booth where, for a couple of dollars you can try your hand at shooting a crossbow. St. Vitus Cathedral is every bit the elaborate cathedral you would expect in a palace. Worth a visit to see the paintings, statuary and windows. There is an incredible window by Alfons Mucha that is worth the visit on its own."

Surprisingly this was exactly what it was, and right opposite another beautiful church - what a pair of buildings to be in such a juxta position.Still moving down we came across numerous palaces, and fountains, and statues, and everyone of interest.

Quite enchanting around the area with lovely walks and quaint streets with small tourist shops, bars, cafe's and restaurants dotted around the cobbled streets. The walk down through the castle and grounds to the city is well worth the experience. Walking up is harder work so take your time."

Once we saw it, we weren\u2019t surprised \u2013 this wasn\u2019t a castle, it was a complete neighbourhood of churches, palaces, halls and gardens and one of the most beautiful cathedrals we\u2019ve ever seen, whose architecture represent virtually every style of the last millennium. Don\u2019t miss the changing of the guards, which happens every day at noon in the front courtyard.We made our way around the cobblestoned steps, necks craned looking skyward the entire time. We stopped at a caf\u00e9 in one of the gardens for a (very expensive) beer, and headed back down into town. We didn\u2019t actually tour the inside of any of the castle (it was too nice a day to be stuck inside for hours!), but you can find ticket prices and opening times here. http://www.hrad.cz/en/prague-castle/prague-castle-tourist-information/tickets.shtmlGreat hike up to the castle, great views from the top, and the most stunning cathedral we've ever seen.

There is a ticket booth inside the 2nd courtyard, go past the entrance where the guards stand, and then through to the next courtyard, and it\u2019s on the left.We saw the changing of the guards while we were there, and it\u2019s very interesting.From the top there are some fantastic views of Prague, its worth it just for the views.And I can recommend golden lane, lovely street with little houses that used to be lived in, so interesting.It took us about 3 hours to get round everything and that did not include st vitus cathedral because it was closed when we were there, which I was gutted about."

The buildings are alike but different if that makes any sense. The district sits on a hill which helps you imagine what life was like \"way back when\" when not everyone lived within the castle walls. This picturesque part of time was fun to walk around with all it's unique shops and cafes. Take your time and enjoy the scenery from on top of the hill and the complete district."

The complex dates from the 9th century & includes the Gothic St Vitus Cathedral, the Vladislav Hall & the Renaissance Belvedere summer palace. The Castle boasts a number of treasures; the recently unveiled Princely Collections are a must-see.Golden Lane is an area that you pay extra to see. It's a row of charming 16th-century small houses where author Franz Kafka lived. Many buildings are now souvenir shops. The area was reopened to the public earlier in 2011 following renovation work. From here you can stroll down the new castle steps to Mala Strana.The Castle is an important part of Prague's heritage and deserves at least half, if not most, of one day. Crowds were evident even in December & I fear that in summer crowds could be overwhelming. "

The only exception are the little houses in 'Golden Street' (I think that is the name) which have been inhabited by artefacts and decorations from the days of their residents,some of which were there up until 1920s, Such a variety of building styles is amazing, and the size of the complex is formidable.

While the castle and mausoleum are interesting, the highlights of the castle district are St. Vitus Cathedral and the Golden Lane. A combo ticket will get you access to all four for 250 CZK (around $13).To get to the castle, take tram 22 from outside Mala Strana metro station. It's only a couple of stops."

            "review": "A must see - the iconic image of Prague. I had to write this review after seeing a new review posted today calling this area 'rubbish'. I cannot imagine such a description of the castle that is the most photographed view of Prague and one that is instantly recognizable. True, it does not look like an English castle, but it housed kings for hundreds of years and is now the seat of the Czech government. I wonder if he took a tour of the inside of some of the buildings? Where jousts were held in the grand halls, and where disgraced politicians were thrown out of windows (the famous defenestrations!). I am heading to Prague again in October and look forward to visiting the castle again. Please do not pay any heed to that other posting. Prague is a wonderful city to visit, and this is just one of its great places - which also includes, by the way, the Golden Street with the original houses from hundreds of years ago (one where Franz Kafka lived for a short time) and where many movies have been filmed (including Amadeus). After visiting the castle, head over to the Estates Theatre where Mozart himself conducted the world premier of Don Giovanni."

Its fantastic and give a great impression of this incredible city.And of course on this side of Charles Bridge you will find a lot of restaurants/bars/cafes with a panoramic view over the city. Also walking along the river is very nice."

I can recommend going up from the new town which leads you to two inetresting churches on the way and give a nice view on Prague. But be aware it is a steep climb and can be hard in case you are not fit. In the castle you do have two museums, one church, lots of statues and paintings and a lot of impreessive sights. Most of the attractions inside are for a fee but the hwole atmosphere of an emperor building something to impress kings and emperors is for free so you can go there nowadays and either feel impressed or happy that everybody now can get into it. A certain do not miss in Prague."

The advantage of this monumental building is the convinient location in the Prague center. You can easily walk from old town square over the Charles bridge (800 years old) up to the castle. The trip takes not more than 2 hours incl some stops in souvenir shops. The castle itself is quite big and includes beautiful gardnes with whole Prague views and fanstastic church in the middle. To see the castle you dont pay any entrance fees just if you want to enter exhibitions or galerries then ofcourse...dont forget to walk through golden gate which is also part of the complex..."

            "review": "Visit in the morning, visit during the night. Hradcany are totally crowded almost every day between late spring and early autumn, so in order to have some breathing room you have either to get up very early (this means: be here around 9 am) or visit the castle around midnight. I recommend doing both: come during the night for the atmosphere; but then come in the morning (not necessarily the day after) for the cathedral and museums. If you start really early, you can get almost everywhere without queuing. But should you wait some 10 minutes to see the changing of the guard, for example - you're lost and the tour groups will be your doom.Don't miss: the St Vitus Cathedral, the Golden Lane and the basilica."

            "review": "Don't pay for the castle!. We've just returned from Prague and if I can pass on one tip it's this: DON'T pay for entry for things! The Hradcany (castle) is very interesting but after queuing for 45 minutes, paying \u00a315 each for a ticket and an extra \u00a315 for an audio guide, we realised as we walked around that pretty much everything is free anyway to get into! It just gives you a fast route to the cathederal and the only bit worth paying for was Golden Lane but alone it's about \u00a34. We'd paid for the basic ticket which included along with the usual free attractions, entry to 3 others - the Golden Lane (a lovely lane of shops and an interesting museum corridor of armoury), an old chapel which was nice (one stone room) but after 2 minutes you'd see it, and the palace - sounds better than it is - it was the old palace which again, was a huge stone hall! I think the full price ticket would have been about \u00a320 each. Nothing is signed in English so unless you pay for the audio guide which is like a 1980s mobile phone, it's all pretty irrellevant. I know it sounsd like I'm impatient or unwilling to 'absorb culture' but quite the opposite - I studied the Hapsburgs at university for 3 years and still had trouble working out what things were! Best advice is to enjoy the architecture and amazing views from up there and save your money!"

Was a bit busy, but the Old Town Square and the walk through the pedestrian streets filled with little shops across cobble stones was like being in a fairy tale. The Charles Bridge is spectacular and the walk up to the Castle was beautiful. We were lucky the weather was not too hot for walking, but was pleasant to sit and have a beer in the sun. We did find a cafe on the way to the Castle up a flight of steep steps. It was called the Mystery Cafe. What a rip off! We were stupid enough to not ask how much the beers were. They charged us \u00a35 per beer! Now I know the rate of exchange is rubbish at the moment, but that is disgusting. In other cafes we were charged anything from 22 crowns to about 49 crowns. But in this place it was 100 crowns a beer. So avoid this bar like the plague.Apart from that had a wonderful time. :) Prague is beautiful and stylish and i loved it."

There are small alleys everywhere, views of Charles Bridge and the Castle. There are also very good views of Mala Strana, Petrin Hill, and Old Town. You can start at the top near the castle, or from the bottom by crossing Charles Bridge and turning right. There are bars, art shops, and few other people. Be warned there are many stairs."
