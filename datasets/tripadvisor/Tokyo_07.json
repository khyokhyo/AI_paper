Lined on both sides by sakura (cherry blossoms) trees that burst into bloom in late March or early April, this walk alongside a portion of the moat surrounding the Imperial Palace is sheer pleasure to behold. But be forewarned - it can be terribly crowded (though, thank goodness, the crowds are always orderly and never rowdy). Try to avoid by going very early in the morning. Cross the road at one end of the walk to go into Yasukuni Shrine, beautiful in the autumn when the gingko trees are sporting their yellow colors."

            "review": "Gorgeous photo ops, and it's free too. There appears to be some confusion as to what area Chidorifugashi actually refers to. Most people may associate it with the park that surrounds the Budokan stadium (actually, that's Kitanomaru Park) or perhaps the moat that surrounds it. Actually, it's the latter along with the path alongside the moat that leads to the boat rental section. The main claim to fame for this area, as many TA reviewers have noted, and as is listed in many guide books, is its abundant cherry blossom trees. During the sakura season, the place is ablaze with the beautiful trees in bloom. Unlike most of the other places in Tokyo where locals like to set up their little picnic with friends and family, a walk along the Chidorifugashi path will reveal that there aren't many places suited to this activity. Instead, it lends itself more to being a place where visitors stroll, admire the gorgeous views both across the moat and above them, and take numerous photos. However, unlike the parks, the one outstanding thing about the area is that it's completely free of charge. If time permits, come in the evening as well as the path is lit up for several hours on selected days of the year."

In summer the moat changes completely and is covered in lotus leaves and eventually the beautiful blossom. Worth a visit for photos and memories."

            "review": "1 word - boating. I visit tokyo twice a year. Ever since i discovered in 2009 in the lake district that i was a fantastic rower, i row whenever i travel and ever since i discovered boating in chidorigafuchi in march 2013, i have never looked back. i discovered boating at Chidorigafuchi only because i was there for the sakura! The sakura at its peak surrounds the length of the moat. It makes for good viewing when one is walking along chidorigafuchi pedestrian path, but the number of visitors and the narrow nature of chidirigafuchi pedestrian path tend to hurry you along when all you really want to do is to plonk yourself on a comfortable seat to view the entire stretch of trees.I have found no such seat save for the seat on a boat. At peak season, the queue for a boat can be lengthy. An hour or so. 40 minutes. But well worth it. You book it by the hour or for half an hour. I started with only an hour in 2013 but by march 2016, i decided 2 hours would be just nice. It was.To row the length of the moat and back would take about an hour with small rests in between . The first time i did this I blistered my hands, but i was hapoy as a lark. This year with my sister in tow, i booked the boat for 2 hours. We had some food with us. I would row near the sakura... underneath its boughs which would touch the water. When you get that close to a sakura tree with just 2 or 3 boats near you, you're in for a magical time. The number of photos we took ! The quiet time we had ! And the view of the entire moat surrounded by the white of the sakura blossoms.In november 2015, the moat was bereft of rowers save for me. My friends refused to join me on the boat (three of us altogether) unless i booked for just half an hour. I did. There were no flowers to look at save for a few patches of purple flowers and a persimmon tree bearing fruits but it was enjoyable nonethless.Nearby chidorigafuchi is the Kitanomaru park - i enjoyed it trmendously in November and in March Apparently the population at the park consists almost entirely of the 'serving members and dependents of the Imperial Guard of the National Police Agency'. My second visit which took place in march 2016 coincided with the graduation ceremony of japan's largest university. Suspect it took place at nippon budokan, just next to the park. The graduation gowns, hairdos and shoes of the women were very interesting. Plenty to see at chiyoda !"

It looked more romantic since the cherry trees go along the beautiful river. Cherry branches sticking together above my head created an amazing view as if it had been in the ferry tale. No matter how crowed it was during cherry blossom season, you should always feel excited.When I remembered I was there, I again glimpsed. One of the best part of my trip!"

Obviously because of the Cherry blossoms and it was a weekend it was very crowded but there was no chaos and everyone moved around without stress.I think we must have been lucky with the boats as the queue was not too long, must have waited around 20 mins. I think it would be worth renting a boat even out of cherry blossom season, I recommend paying more and renting for an hour. We only did 30 mins but it went really quickly and we enjoyed it more than we thought."

There were still plenty of people. We didn't see the boats in the moat of the original Edo canal. The trees were beautiful and partially lit. There were some picnickers but this was a very calm space. The only negative for us was the walk from Tokyo Station (we started by the entrance to the palace and walked clockwise) and back to the station. This must be one of the most popular running paths in Tokyo and it was disconcerting to see so many people running at us, as they were going in the counterclockwise direction. Nevertheless, people were generally very considerate."

This may have been a translation issue because I didn't see any wind (but there were no boats out either). We'd been traveling north through the country as the blossom wave swept Japan so we had already been seeing cherry blossoms for 2 weeks by this point but I was still so amazed to arrive at this location with hundreds of trees in full bloom along with the water feature. Breath taking truly. Probably my my memorable cherry bloom spot of the trip but some of that is timing as 3 days later this would have been nice but not as amazing ect. One thing to note it was CROWDED... I know this is Tokyo but this was 5 people inside my personal space at any time crowded all along the path ways and as people stopped for pictures you were at a standstill. There is one iconic shot and there were literally 20 people deep snapping dslrs above their heads trying to get it. So other people agree at the awesomeness and keep that in mind.We came back that night to see the illumination and again that was amazing (I prefer the day though) but it was nice to see both. The Indian consulate across the road was having a bended festival with cherry blossoms which was neat and we got some dinner there and listened to some Indian musicians while watching the crowds and lit up blossoms across the street. One thing to note, we got off at the wrong station for this park and the Japanese people didn't seem to know the name of this area. Even when I showed them the Kanji form of \"Chiforigafuchi\" on my phone but they did know the area as water, boats and cherry blossoms so I'm not sure what the locals refer to this spot."

Kudanshita (Chidori-ga-fuchi) is one of the best spots to go for a hanami (sakura viewing) walk around the moat. When we went for sakura hanami (as it\u2019s known in Japanese), there was a festival going on at the Indian Embassy located close to the sakura pathway. There are sakura trees lined up on the sides of the pathway, and many people like to come here for a walk as they can also enjoy sakura at the same time.Unlike Tokyo\u2019s Ueno Park or Asakusa, Kudanshita does not really have much space to sit down and have a \u2018hanami party\u2019, but Kudanshita\u2019s sakura is definitely worth a visit if you don\u2019t mind a little walk for 1-2 hours.Yasukuni Shrine- one of Japan\u2019s most famous and controversial shrines, is also quite close from here. The closest train station is Kudanshita on Hanzomon Line.If you're in Tokyo around cherry blossom time, this spot is worth a visit."

It was held for one week from the last weekend of March, or it always included this particular week, depending on the time when cherry blossoms were in full bloom. So I booked a hotel and bought an air ticket 6 months before.  The weather was very cold during the last week of March. But all of a sudden it warmed up and it was announced that the cherry blossoms were in full bloom in Tokyo on Sunday 29th March -the day I arrived in Tokyo! My Japanese friend told me to go early in the morning to avoid the crowd of people. The direction given on the website suggested to go from Hanzomon Station rather than Kudanshita Station. So my 85-year old friend and I arrived at Hazomon Station at around 9:30am and followed the signs to Chidorigafuchi. We joined a few people going upwards on the footpath along the moat side of Chidorigafuchi. We took time to enjoy the cherry blossoms, especially on the other side (i.e.,, Kitanomaru Park) of the moat. But we began to notice that more and more people from Kudanshita Station were coming down along the moat side of the path. So we gave up going against the stream of people and walked on the path that was away from the moat. But occasionally I cut through the stream of people to go near the fence of the moat in order to take photos.  Finally we reached the end of Chidorigafuchi and went across to the side gate of Yasukuni Shrine. As we were so exhausted, we caught a taxi and returned to Ikebukuro. The taxi driver was delighted to have passengers who wanted to go a 'long distance', not a nearby train station. We enjoyed seeing cherry blossoms along the way. Taxi fare was a bit over 3,000yen."

(a bit late for 2015, but perhaps useful for future readers) Tips for cherry blossom viewing :Tip 1 - enter the park via Kudanshita station. The best views are along the moat. Walk southwards, and then cut into the park for a different feel (i.e view the trees from higher ground). Tip 2 - go early (before 10am). It gets really crowded by mid day, but luckily the crowds were generally pretty civilised.Tip 3 - estimate 2 - 3 hours to complete the viewing session.I visited 4 sakura viewing spot during my recent visit - Chidorigafuchi, Naka Meguro, Shinjuku Koen, Takiyama (outskirt of Tokyo). Each site provide a different experience, but I would give this the top vote."

Immediately upon exiting the top of the stairs at Tokyo Metro Tozai line-Kudanshita station...we gasped at the sheer beauty & loveliness of the Cherry Blossoms surrounding the moat of the Imperial Palace. The memories of that first glance will last a lifetime! It is the combination of the water, the cherry blossom trees lining both sides of the moat, the boaters enjoying a tender romantic experience as the rest of us envy them their private time, the hanami viewers young and old, holding hands...everyone drinking in the fresh air, walking along the sidewalk overlooking the moat. Its just wonderful! Make the time to go here....if you have time for only 1 place to view the Tokyo Cherry Blossoms!"

Breathtaking, even in the rain. Take note that cherry blossom-viewing is a fleeting thing, that can last for only a few days before they all fall down. Ask a local which particular park is in full bloom. But if you happen to be in Tokyo at the right time, THIS is the most dramatic spot. It's worth the wait for your taxi afterward."

When I go here, it makes me feel like I left the city even though I am in the directly in the middle of it. The park is really huge. The sights are really beautiful during cherry blossom season (end of March to early April) so I suggest to visit here then. Other seasons the park is much less interesting but still a place I would frequent to take a walk."

A decent place to stop by if you're going to be in the area anyway. Nice for an evening stroll. Going by the photos, it should be a lovely place when the cherry blossoms are blooming."

If you are a newcomer to Tokyo, you may be appealed by a boat ride on the Imperial Palace moat in Chidorigafuchi. If you are not, you know that there are better things to see and do in Tokyo. The season climax for this place is in late March / early April during the cherry blossom season when the trees become pink-white flower clouds touching the water and giving the place a special atmosphere. Unfortunately this is also the most crowdy period of course, which makes the whole thing much less romantic... The rest of the year it is still nice, however you should not expect anything so special."

I was looking forward to a pleasant canoe ride near the walls of the castle. However, I was extremely disappointed when I actually got there. I walked around the river and realized there is really not much here except a tiny park, and limited views of a corner of the palace gates and a few buildings in the distance. Unfortunately, the area with the boats was fairly far from the gates and was totally shut down when I was there. Maybe it might be prettier during cherry blossom season, but that was not my expectation (as I came in august) and still thought this attraction fell short."

I'm just repeating other reviewer's comments but this is a beautiful spot to see cherry blossoms.I stumbled upon it purely by chance and what a piece of luck that was. The best part is looking down onto the moat, with people rowing boats, laughing and having fun, with the cherry tree blossom in full bloom on both sides of the water acting both as a frame and as a veil. Beautiful."

It is across the street from the Yasakuni Shrine, which is another of the great places to see the blooms so I usually go here every year.Basically it is a remnant of the old moat that protected Edo Castle. Only the gate remains but it is impressive none the less.In the off season it is a local dog walking venue, but still a nice bit of green in an otherwise rather bleak urban environment."

We went right as the blossomes hit 100% blossoming and it was one the most impressive viewing we'd experienced on our 10 day stay in Tokyo. The gtree's were very full, in the background you could see the moat and little boats. We were there at sunset one day and they had lights on the trees so you could appreciate their beauty as the day came to a close. Also, they had two festivals in the area, one hosted by the Indian emabassy on the edge of the park, we skipped this one. The other festival was a local street festival across the streen from the park, there were dozenns of food vendors selling fish, octopus balls, yakisoba, etc. It was an amazing festival, they had picnic tables out and tarps on the ground. The best Japan experience we had during our entire stay."

            "review": "The winter is not the best time to see Chidorigafuchi. I can only imagine how beautiful the walk to the cemetery and the surrounding gardens would have been had the cherry trees been blossoming when we visited. However, we were in Tokyo in December, and so the long walk under hibernating trees was...just a long walk (I imagine had we visited with the cherry blossoms I would have rated it five stars, so take that into consideration). It's so strange to me now that I'm going back to write individual reviews that my reviews are so low--we had a wonderful time in Tokyo and I'm not sure the three star ratings reflect this. I think the reason many of my Chiyoda reviews are only average is that Tokyo, while a fabulous city, has not done much to make itself a capitol city that is appealing to tourists (talking strictly about the government offices, monuments, etc. and not about the rest of what Tokyo has to offer). When you are in Washington DC, everything is grand (contrasting to the modest size of Japanese monuments) and nearly everyone you see is obviously a tourist--Washington DC as has made the nation's capitol a city worth seeing strictly for the government sites--this is not the case for Tokyo if that makes more sense. My husband and I felt like the only tourists we saw all day. For example, once we arrived at the National Cemetery, we were literally the only two people there, tourists or not; granted we were there during the off season and not that this is a bad thing. If you're expecting the grandness of the US' war memorials (thinking Korean War Veterans Memorial, Vietnam Veterans War Memorial Wall, Arlington National Cemetery), you will be disappointed by this cemetery--though it's important to reflect on what these differences might say about each nation, its unique values, how we are alike, how we are different. Though this memorial honors 3 MILLION lost souls, it is very small with only one small gazebo housing one symbolic coffin (that I believe contains remains of unidentified casualties). Very little is explained in English, which is fine but does limit one's understanding of the memorial if you don't bring your own guide book or do your own research prior to your visit. A very touching point here is that for 100 yen you can buy a flower (on the honor system) and lay it at the tomb. The restrooms are Japanese style."

Passing this seemingly endless tunnel of Sakura trees one Spring on a midnight taxi was amazing. It touched me deeply and I asked the driver to stop the car. Walking under those trees, I almost wept for a while. Foreign visitors, if you happen to be in Tokyo at the time of cherry blossoms, you should come here around midnight for an unforgettable view that you shall cherish for your lifetime."
